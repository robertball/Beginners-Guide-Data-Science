After reading the reviews for this recipe I was a little nervous about making it.  It seemed as though people either absolutly loved or just outright hated it.  But I was feeling adventurous and I personally love cinnamon so I thought I'd give it a go.  One word, Fantastic.  I did change a few things though.  Instad of dumping all the ingredients in a bowl and mixing away, I combined the dry ingredients and the wet ingredients separately, then mixed the dry into the wet slowly.  Then I took the advice from some other reviewers and doubled the topping and put half of it in the middle of the cake.  Instead of using 2 tablespoons of white sugar, I just used one and added a tablespoon of brown sugar which worked very nicely.  I baked my loaf in a glass pan so I had to add about 15 minutes to the baking time.  The bread rose wonderfully and it had a beautiful crackly top.  It was deliciously moist with a great cinnamon flavor- not bland at all like some other reviewers said.  It reminded me of something  I might buy in a coffee shop. Definately give this bread a try.

HELPFUL TIPS AFTER MAKING THIS FOR SEVERAL YEARS: Worried that other reviewers said this was bland but needed to rid of the buttermilk, so i tried it anyway.  Here's what I did & it came out w/much love from my family!  1st, Grease pan!  Definitely mix dry FIRST then liquids in separate bowl.  Hand mix only until ingredients are mixed!!!!!!  For topping: I double it replacing white sugar with brown sugar.  Put half of it in the middle, swirled that w/fork.  Put the rest on top.  GREAT STUFF esp. when you run into one of the swirls.  Next time I will DEFINITELY triple the topping (half in middle, rest on top).  My husband HATES sweet things (never eats frosting or sweets), and think it will by no means make it sweet but give a NORMAL amount of swirl in a "cinnamon type bread" you get at the store.  Update: I ran out of buttermilk & instead used 1T of lemon juice & filled the rest of the cup with milk & it came out the same (also an acceptable substitution).  Raisins also work well in the recipe but not needed.

With small modifications, this is a great recipe.  First of all, since it's a quick bread, you MUST mix the dry and wet ingredients separately.  Do not beat the batter for three mintues; instead, mix the dry and wet ingredients lightly until the batter is just combined. Keep in mind that the struesel is not a topping...it sinks into the cake.  I doubled the struesel (using brown sugar instead of white) and sprinkled some in the middle of the loaf.  Also, consider using something bigger than a loaf pan, or else place a cookie sheet one rack lower than the loaf pan to catch the "drippings."  Would probably be beautiful in a bundt pan.

This is a perfect little breakfast or tea bread.  Delicately spiced with cinnamon, moist and with a just right sweetness that makes it a good choice as the submitter states, "for a little something beyond the usual to start your morning," or just anytime with a cup of coffee. I liked the idea of doubling the topping, and using half in the center of the loaf, and I was pleased with the results. For those who complained this was dry, boring or bland, my first thought is that it's not the recipe's fault but maybe that they're baking this too long and/or expecting cake. This is a delicious, not too sweet quick bread.  Also, for those who thought the topping failed, it does not--this is not a streusel topping, which would include flour.  This topping creates a pleasantly sweet, pebbly top. Thanks for sharing the recipe Carol!

Very easy to prepare, good results.  I wish I had read the reviews and doubled the topping before I made the bread though.  Needs a bit more cinnamon/swirls.  I also used the milk/vinegar trick!

This bread was simple to make and delicious!  Moist and all around yummy!  I like to put a small swipe of butter on it.  I did find that after the recommended 50 minutes, it was still gooey in the middle and so I did bake for an additional 10 minutes.  Changed the bake time to 60 minutes on my recipe card.  Other than that - de-lish!

This was very good.  I used no-fat buttermilk; low fat margarine for the topping and replaced 1/2 the oil with applesauce and I cut back on the sugar to 3/4 c.  Still very tasty and moist.  Will make again.

I followed the advice of other reviewers and doubled the topping, putting half in the center of the loafs.  I baked mini loafs and plan to give them as gifts.  Also, I baked the bread in stoneware and the pan made a huge difference, the sides of the bread were a light golden brown.  Great recipe - thanks!

This recipe was GREAT! I made 2 recipes, one for my family and the other for my boyfriend. (each recipe makes one loaf) And everyone LOVED it! My boyfriend doesn't really like very sweet things so the amount of sweetness was just right. I added one cup of raisins to the 2recipe batter...there was a spinkle of raisins in each slice but if u like a lil more i suggest you add 3/4 cup per recipe....it was very moist,  but make sure u oil the pan well or it will stick...I also gave the surface of the bread a lil shine by taking a lil egg white and mixing that with some ,sugar and brushing this mixture on the top of the bread.  Do this when the bread is practically finished baking because it only needs a min or so to set the egg white/sugar mixture...when this cools, it leaves a nice shine to the surface..it is a lil sticky, but its sweet!! The bread makes your whole kitchen smelling so good when its baking and cooling! I will definatly make this again! :)

This is a recipe for a really delicious loaf of bread, but I had to adjust the process a bit.  Instead of dumping everything into a bowl and beating them all together, I mixed the dry and wet ingredients separately and then stirred the dry into the wet (be careful not to overmix!).  This makes the bread moister and more tender.  Also I used brown sugar instead of white in the topping, and I doubled the topping and put half in the middle.  Very, very tasty.

I made this recipes for a potluck at my boyfriend's work. It went over really well and I was surprised by the tasty nature of the bread. Instead of buttermilk (which I couldn't find and probably wouldn't have used anyway), I used 1 cup of apple cinnamon flavored yogurt. It added great flavor. I also added a few tablespoons of milk to make the dough more pliable. Next time, I will make double the topping and be sure to add it to the middle of the bread.

This is a good, tender bread.  It does help to double the topping mix, and layer it with half in the middle of the bread and the rest on top.

ok... So this bread is amazing, however, I changed it some and it was the most moist bread i have ever made... Instead of a 1/4 cup of Veg oil I used almost 1 cup Applesauce and instead of Buttermilk I used 2% milk with a dash of vinegar. I mixed the flour, baking powder, soda, cinnamon and salt and set aside, then combined the milk, applesauce, eggs vanilla and sugar. After I beat that for a minute or so I added the dry ingredients.. It looked super runny but man it turned into one fantastic bread!!!! I did not do the topping!!! Awesome!!

Very good cinnamon bread  - perfect with tea or coffee in the morning.  All I did different was to double the topping.

This is a great, easy quick bread recipe!  It does not have a heavy cinnamon flavor.  I put home made honey/vanilla flavored butter on the warm bread, to die for!

Great bread. I have been making lots of different kinds looking for my "gift" bread for the holidays. Not sure this is it but it's in the running. The only thing I did differently was I doubled the topping recipie and I actually melted the butter then slightly cooled it and it make the "swirling" a breeze. I also poured half the batter in the pan, Swirled in half the topping then added the remaining batter and Swirled in the other half of the topping. Made a pretty center in the bread. Thank you Carol

So very yummy!  I took the advice of another review and doubled the topping and put half the batter in and sprinkled and then added the rest of the batter and sprinkled the rest on top.  It was moist and not too sweet.  Children and adults loved it!  Thank you!

EXCELLENT RECIPE!  Think it's my new favourite!  The cinnamon/sugar crumble topping is undeniably the best part.  The crumble effect didn't work out for me too well though (probably cut into it too much).  The bread was moist and soft.  I didn't have any buttermilk on hand so I used a TBSP of vinegar and a little less than a cup of milk.  There was a lighter taste of cinnamon.  I think I'll double the topping next time and add a little more cinnamon just to give it a little more flavour (personal preference).  MY FAMILY LOVED IT!!!  Probably won't last long in this house!  DEFINITELY A KEEPER!!!

Really yummy bread. Much better the second day. I followed the recipe with only one minor change, I substituted brown sugar for white in the crumble topping. Yummy!

Excellent, *easy* recipe.  Make sure to *really* grease the pan well though.  (I greased my well, but the bottom still stuck.)  This will become a regularly made recipe in my home.

I must have done something wrong with this recipe, because both pans overflowed within 15 mnutes of baking. I'm not sure what could have happened - I mixed it correctly and my oven is calibrated perfectly. Also all the topping sank to the bottom and did not look appetizing at all. . .I was planning to give these out as Christmas gifts but they ended up in the trash. Sorry to be a naysayer, but I won't use this again.

Not bad, not great either. Cake like consistency but the flavor is pretty dull. Could use some work. Maybe raisins, apples, nuts, something.

This was a great cinnamon bread.  My 3 1/2 yr old daughter chose this recipe and did most of the work making it.  It was delicious.  She enjoyed it.  So did mommy, daddy, grandma and grandpa.  Very nice taste.

This was delicious!  I did as others said and mixed the wet and dry separately then combined. I also double the topping and put half in the middle and half on top. Mine took closer to an hour to bake. At 50 minutes the middle was still not quite done.
I want to make a note here that it makes a big difference in the pan you use. I made this twice, first time in a shiny pan and the next in a darker. The shiny pan took longer to bake and was much moister inside. The darker pan seemed to get it very brown and I could have baked it less time than the other.

LOVED THIS!  When I saw this, it looked so easy to make so couldn't help but try it right away.  My husband and I both cut this while still warm and were very very impressed!!  After reading a few reviews, I had made the following adjustments.  1) I mixed the dry in one bowl and wet (including the sugar) in another.  Then added the dry to the wet and mixed just until combined (do not over mix). Similar to the process when making muffins  2) For 1 cup buttermilk, I used 1 tbsp lemon juice and then added milk to measure 1 cup.  I've always substituted buttermilk this way. This simple trick always works well   3) I doubled the topping.  4) I lined the loaf pan with parchment paper. This allows easy removal from the pan (just lift the paper on the long sides and lift the loaf right up and out).  This also makes for amazingly easy cleanup!  4) I put half the batter and sprinkled half the topping. I cut through and swirled (minimal) with a knife. Then repeated with the 2nd half of batter and then remaining topping.  Again, swirled through with a knife.  Eat it plain or with a little margarine.  Delicious!

awesome bread the whole family loves and very easy to make! I didn't have oil so I used butter for both the oil and the margarine and I didn't have buttermilk but substituted one tbls of lemon juice in a cup of skim milk.

I really like this recipe.  I made 2 loaves as gifts for my sisters & their husbands.  Both really liked it so much that my one sister now wants the recipe.  The only change I would make in the future would be to make a little more of the topping.

This was my first time making bread...this recipe was easy and the bread turned out delicious! Half of it was gone in a few hours. I tripled the topping - it tasted really nice. It wasn't really really cinammon-y, even though I added more cinammon to the bread then the recipe suggested, but oh well. Next time I'll probably add nuts or raisins. I loved the top, it was nicely cracked, crunchy, and sweet. The bread has a cake-like constancy and shouldnt be used for toasting, but it was fabulous!

This is 'ok', but definitely could be better.  The taste is just right for a cinnamon bread, but the end result wasn't what I thought it would be.  Be careful if you are using a bread pan as directed!  My batter overflowed within 10 minutes in the oven.  I had to change it into a cake pan and lost the top of the cake which had the 'crumbly' mix.  (That never even turned out to be crumbly at all!)  It baked fine but developed a chewy, distasteful crust on the sides and on the bottom.  Also, it was a little dry and stuck to the pan.  Perhaps it was too much baking powder?  Try this recipe if you want to be experimental, but I think I'll look elsewhere my second time.

Wonderful bread!  Smelled so delicious when baking -- my kids couldn't wait to try it.  I forgot to put the topping on but it was still very tasty.  Will definitely make it again.

I baked this cinnamon bread to serve at coffee time at my church.  At one point I saw a five-year-old hand scooping three slices at once while muttering "I like this. . . "  He obviously wasn't the only one, as this bread disappeared in a matter of minutes.

I followed the ingredients but just added 2 teas of cinnamon instead of the 1 1/2 teas of cinnamon just because we LOVE cinnamon so much. And from being a baker I mixed all my wet ingredients first, put all the dry ingredients together in a bowl and then slowly added the dry ingredients to the wet mixture. I also doubled the topping and put half the topping in the middle of the bread before I baked it. The only problem with that was as the butter melted while baking and the layer of cinnamon in the middle of the bread seeped down to the bottom of the pan. Taking the bread out of the pan, the cinnamon layer stayed in the pan. It tasted great if you picked it off the pan, LOL. So next time I will not use butter for the middle layer of topping.. I'm looking for that layer of cinnamon sugar in the middle of my bread. This was a GREAT recipe and easy to make. THANKS!!!

The recipe worked well with whole wheat flour, but I did add an extra 2 tablespoons of milk (the vinegar trick is good!).  I took another reviewer's advice and made extra topping; some was poured in the middle of the batter and some put on top.  Also, I didn't have enough vanilla left, so I substituted some almond extract (which is pretty good - adds a little nutty aftertaste.)

This was SO simple. I combined the dry ingredients in my Kitchen Aid and briefly ran the whipping tool through it to sift the ingredients a bit, then added all the wet and briefly blended together until moistened. I did use butter instead of vegetable oil and I doubled the topping and did a a layer in the middle AND top before swirling. I plan on letting it sit overnight, covered, then serving it for breakfast tomorrow.

Yummmmm... really good bread recipe, especially since it doesn't include yeast. Only modifications: Mix dry and wet seperately and by hand. Also, I found that a better substitute for buttermilk is 1 cup milk and 2 tablespoons sourcream.

My whole family liked this.  I didn't have vanilla, so I omitted it. I also didn't have butter milk. so I used 1/2 milk and 1/2 light cream and about 2tsps of lemon juice.  I seperated the dry and wet ingredients before mixing them together.  I also tripled the topping.  I put 1/2 the batter into the loaf pan and sprinked half the topping onto it, then repeated.  I swirled the topping like stated, but I'm not sure that is a necessary step, because it just blends in anyways. Thanks

O.k.  I will be honest.  I pretty much skipped the topping and just used loads of spices and extra sugar in the loaf itself.  The recipe itself produced a beautiful, full loaf.  A lot of times I get a flat, dense loaf that is just heavy.  I was really impressed by how little work went into a great basic loaf that was great for a simple breakfast with coffee.

I love cinnamon and I love bread so this great combo made me one happy camper. My daughter and I made this tonight while the boys were out. We are thrilled that this turned out so great! Other than doubling the "sugar crumbs" and using brown sugar instead of white (for the crumbs only!!), I didn't change a thing!! Baked beautifully and tastes great! Its so popular, I expect it to be gone after breakfast tomorrow morning!!  Thanks Carol!!

WOW!  Very easy and has wonderful flavor!  I made two smaller loaves and they turned out perfect.  I used the foil pans and sprayed them with cooking spray...they slid right out.  They did not overflow at all. I waited to put the topping on until it had about ten mins. left to cook and it did not sink into the batter at all.  It came out crispy and just right.  We have already devoured one loaf and have started on the second.  Perfect for breakfast!  I will be making two more loaves today to take with me to work....they will love it!  Thanks for the recipe.  I will definitely pass it along!

I used honey instead of sugar. (I always do) And I added more cinnamon, but it was still lacking.My guest liked it, but they also heaped butter and honey on top. For me if your gust have to add to it, it is not good enough. I won't make it again.

YUM - so moist and so easy! Next time I am going to try adding some sultanas and a little mixed spice. A great addition to a lunch when guests are coming or for the picnic basket.

I've made this bread several times with amazing success. All who have tried it love it and it is so simple it is almost sinful. The texture is more like that of a cake and yet filling like bread. Thanks for the great recipe!

I was looking for recipes to use some sour milk 
that I had and I found this one.  I made it for 
my boyfriend and he loved it.  It usually doesn't
last more than one day.

I also mixed my dry and wet ingredients seperately. As suggested I doubled the topping and put half of it in the middle of the cake. It was great!

Delicious!! I took the advice of the other people who reviewed, and made 2x the topping putting half in the middle. I also put the wets and dries separate, and then mixed them just before baking. It makes a very big loaf, and it's absolutely wonderful!

I can't give this a 5 star, because I didn't have any.  But everyone else loved it, so I will give it a 4 store. I was told it tasted like a coffee cake.  I don't know about others, but I didn't get a marbled effect, everything just seemed to melt into the batter.

This was pretty good.  I have to say it grew on me-when I first tasted it I thought it was a little  bland but it kept getting better as I ate my slice.  I followed other reviewers advice to mix the topping into the middle and those little pockets of sugar were really nice.  My son LOVED this!  All in all, it was well received and I ended up liking it too~I think it just wasn't quite as moist and sweet as I expected when I took my first bite.  But I will definitely make it again.  Thanks!!

Ok, I have made this about at least a dozen times and am finally getting around to a review. It is wonderful!! I have been asked for this recipe on many occasions. It comes out exactly the same every time. The only thing I usually change is, I cut the sugar in half with splenda. It is already relatively low in fat, so I don't adjust anything there. Perfect with a cup of coffee!

Very Good!  
I make a few changes to make it a bit more healthy - husband is diabetic.  I used 1 cup wheat flour & 1 cup regular.  I substituted Splenda for the 1 cup of suger in the batter.  I did not have any vanilla extract so I used almond.  It was still really good.

This was great! I had to change it up a lot, though. I needed it to be gluten free, and I was out of eggs, white sugar and buttermilk. I replaced the flour with all-purpose gluten free flour from Whole Foods, I replaced the eggs with two large bananas, the white sugar with brown sugar and the buttermilk with almond milk. This bread was *amazing*!

I have made this several times, even gave my mom the recipe (She makes this twice a month now).  I have tried the vinegar milk trick, but buttermilk really makes it taste better.  I also took other reviewers advice and mixed the wet ingredients, minus the milk, and the flour separately.  I then blended alternating milk and flour.  I also doubled the topping, and used it after pouring half the batter.  I find this to be more to my liking.  This is a really easy and delicious recipe.  Thanks

I have made this several times now.  Like others I mixed the dry ingredients and moist ingredients separately and then combined them.  I also tripled the struessel, filled loaf pan half way, swirled in half, filled the rest of pan and swirled in the rest of the struessel.  Fabulous!

This is a very nice bread.  It is not extra sweet and that is great for my house.  My husband is not fond of sweets AT ALL, but he loved this bread, so it's a great one for "non-dessert-eaters".  I had to bake it for an extra 10 minutes; but I have a gas oven, so keep that in mind.  Also, it tastes just great without vanilla, for those who don't use extract because of the brandy in it.  I will definately keep this recipe in my books.

This is a great recipe, but I made a few changes based on some of the other reviews.  I added a bit of nutmeg and increased the cinnamon.  I also doubled the topping mixture and used half of it in between layers on batter.  I used a bundt pan, so it turned out more like a coffee cake than bread, but it was delicious!  I plan to use this one again soon!  Great recipe, Carol!

I made this exactly as stated and it was a wonderful alternative to the yeast cinnamon breads I usually make, and half the time too. I do not normally have buttermilk so I use a substitute; 3TBS vinegar,add enough milk to make one cup and let stand ten minutes. Voila buttermilk, has always worked for me  without fail. Such a moist bread with the perfect amount of cinnamon flavor. I made double the topping, did layers of batter, topping, batter, topping and slightly swirled it to perfection! So pretty and yummy! I mixed the dry and wet ingredients separately and was unsure of how to beat it ( hand or electric?), so into the kitchen aid it went on medium for 3 min. No problems at all. I love this recipe and will continue to make it in the future. I made Brandy Apple Butter also from here to accompany it, pure deliciousness,  Bon appetite!

Just made this for the first time. Did it in a Bundt pan to maximize the crust (good call) and as others suggest I mixed the wet/dry ingredients separately before mixing together. I may add more cinnamon next time (or just do all fresh ground), but overall was really satisfied with the results. I didn't find it bland at all, but rather as having a light, pleasant flavor. Tomorrow I'll toast a slice with a little butter!

I read the reviews and doubled the topping using brown instead of white sugar and used butter instead of margarine. Used 1/2 applesauce and half canola oil,put half of the filling in the middle and half on top and swirled it. Awesome!! Thank you for posting!

This is the second time I've made this recipe, and I really like it!  Nice breakfast bread that uses ingredients I always keep on hand.  The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because 50 minutes wasn't quite enough time; it needed about 10-15 minutes more.  But it turned out wonderful and delicious--nice for a change of pace in the morning.  Would probably be even more awesome with raisins!

Doubled the topping, mixed wet & dry ingredients separately first, then mixed together with a light hand like you would do for muffins. Also subbed a small amt of whole wheat flour for the white. Tasty!

Loved this! One of the best new quick breads that I have made in a long time. Had a little trouble with the topping, but the overall taste was great. Thank you!

I made two loaves of this bread as gifts so i never actually got to try it! However, I'm giving 5 stars based on the rave reviews i received! Will definitely make again - this time for me!! By the way - i DID follow the advice of other reviewers and mixed the wet and ry separately, then combined. I also doubled the streusel and put half in the middle and half on top. Obviously, i had no complaints!

Nice and moist. Bake time was so on. However, next time I think I'll cut the salt in haf, double the cinnamon and maybe add some chocolate chips. Ok bread but kind of blah.

super yummy!! Very moist and just the right amount of sweet! I replaced the oil with applesauce, and white sugar for brown sugar. I found the crumble topping just absorbed into the batter, didnt make a swirl. But it tasted great anyway!

Great recipe! I did what the other reviews suggested, and made double the topping (butter, brown sugar, cinnamon) and swirled some in the middle of the loaf. I also sprinkled chopped walnuts in the middle layer as well as over the top - the texture is great! I will definitely make this again.

It tasted good but also somewhat boring in my opinion.  I think it would have been better with some raisins or nuts in it though.

Very yummy recipe! My dad who doesn't usually eat a lot of bread loved this! I followed some of the other suggestions and made double the topping and put half in the middle and also used half brown sugar. Definitely a keeper, can't wait to make this again very soon! As others stated, just remember, this is a bread, not a cake, so its not overly sweet.

Mmm, Delicious! Made a few minor changes to make this a bit healthier, used half whole wheat flour and used non-fat vanilla yogart instead of the oil. This bread was very flavorful, took the advise of others to mix wet/dry seperatly and to swirl the struesal mixture into the bread along with on top. I will definelty be making this again, although next time I will probably decrease the sugar to try to make this healthier.

This was really yummy. It almost tasted like a bread version of a doughnut but without the great amounts of fat!  It's really nice warm with a tiny bit of butter.  Will bake again :)

I love this! I love cinnamon! I love something sweet and cinnamon that isn't a cinnamon roll. It's dense and moist and delicious. I didn't make any adjustments. Just perfect the way it is.

Delicious as a bread and also made into muffins.  I usually use applesauce instead of the oil, and they still taste great.

My attempt at this came out great! I had no problems at all. I seriously hope this is not the case for all the rest of you, as it will make your clothes seriously shrink if it works out...it did to me.

The bread really smelled 5-star. As for taste and texture wise, we had mixed reviews! I made this last night after reading most reviews and made the following changes: - •	Double topping mixture but eventually found no need as there were plenty (even with middle-swirling of batter). •	Used fingers to evenly layer topping mixtures to avoid sinking and then swirled with fork and it worked well! Just ensure topping is not too heavy... •	Used 1 tbsp of vinegar and top the rest with milk to make a cup. •	Used spatula to mix dry and the wet ingredients separately and slowly before combining them like some others.  The bread rose beautifully high after 45 minutes of baking in a 9x 5 loaf pan (no need to divide into 2 pans like others unless they use smaller loaf pans) and mine did have the desired “marble effect”… after above efforts. Sadly,  hubby could not even finish his small piece served warmed last night as he found the texture “weird” and not at all like breads… it was more like a hardened cake! I, on the other hand, fairly enjoyed its’ crispiness but found the “bread” to be rather bland in taste. It tasted worst the next day. Sorry, will not be making it again.

I was really excited about this recipe, and followed other reviews by adding the extra ribbon of cinnamon and streusel. I even added a light sugar drizzle on top. Sadly, I do not think I would make it again. It did not have the flavor I was hoping for.

For the directions, I didn't follow them exactly.  I mixed wet and dry separately, then combined together (always do this with any quick bread!).  I doubled the topping and used brown sugar for it instead of white.  Put half of it inside the bread and half on the top. I also used the milk/vinegar combo instead of buttermilk.  As for the taste and texture - it's pretty good.  A nice amount of cinnamon and the bread is very moist.  I would probably bake it 40-45 minutes next time as the crust came out a little dry.  I had no problems with the loaf sticking (sprayed the pan with cooking spray) or with overflow (although I did put a cookie sheet underneath just in case).  In fact it did rise but not enough to go over the top of the pan, but that might of been my baking powder/soda.  Overall, a good bread I would make again, with a few tweaks.

Delicious! I did half whole wheat flour and half white, used lactose-free skim milk + 1 tbsp. vinegar and it worked out fine. Agreed that I could use more swirly bits, but it was fine as it is!

I used 1c vanilla yogurt instead of buttermilk and it was a hit with my family. Very rich and flavorful. I've made it twice and my only problem is that my filling always falls all of the way to the bottom. It still tastes great though!

I love this recipe.  I did replace the oil with applesauce to cut down on fat and increased the topping.  I put half the topping in the middle of the batter and the rest on top.  It disappeared when I took it to work.

This was so good.  I followed the recipe except for the topping- like many reviewers, I doubled it, using brown sugar and real butter.  I also added some extra cinnamon to the batter itself.  Don't beat for 3 minutes- combine dry, then wet, and mix together just until combined.  So good with some butter.  I made it for my family and it's all gone.  Thanks!

this bread was very delish with a few little alterations.  i added more cinnamon to the batter, substituted fat-free vanilla yogurt for the buttermilk (didn't want to buy it) and 1/2 cup applesauce for the oil.  Instead of the swirl suggested, i used the following (which i stole from another cinnamon bread recipe!): 1/3 cup sugar mixed with 2 T. cinnamon.  i sprinkled half to create a swirl in the bread and the rest of it on top.  it was SO good!  great flavor and hearty, yet light texture (ie: it wasn't super overly moist and dense, but it wasn't dry and too light)  it was just perfect!  the sticky swirly top and center from the cinnamon-sugar was DEFINITELY the best part ... use liberally!

Very good bread.  I was very pleased with the finished product.  As I always do, I combined the dry & wet ingredients separately.  I also layered mine as some of the other reviewers suggested, by putting some of the struesel topping halfway through the batter as well as on top.  I had to bake mine for 67 minutes though before it was fully cooked.  I love the crunchy top on this bread.  Overall great recipe, just required a little tinkering!  I will definitely make this again.

What a disappointment! This is my last day off on vacation from work and I was so hoping to have a nice treat with my morning coffee. Not with this bread. This bread can't decide if it is a bread or a cake or somewhere in between. I made this exactly to recipe except for mixing wet and dry seperately first and then adding the dry to the wet, mixing well (as other reviewers have suggested). Nothing wrong with my oven or my baking skills. For those of you that like to criticize others reviews I suggest you come over here, observe the prep, test the oven, find no fault, and then sit here and eat the finished product!! I don't have a dog for you to feed it to under the table! I have some ideas on where to go from here but it will be a total recipe revamp. Now I have to go figure out what do do with the remaining buttermilk that I bought for this recipe. Thanks anyway.

This was GREAT! I took the advice of other reviewers and I tripled the filling, saving a little bit out before I swirled it in, then used the remaining to sprinkle just on top before I baked it. I also mixed the dry and the wet ingridents seperatly for the batter as suggested. I baked it in a bunt pan for about 45 minuts and it was just delicious, everyone LOVED it! Thanks for all the great suggestions and a special thanks for this great recipe!!

This is a very nice quick bread recipe. It's not anything fancy, but since I usually have all the ingredients on hand, it's a good breakfast standby for unexpected overnight guests (does anyone else's in-laws do that to them?)  Buttermilk isn't a staple in my house, so I just use the milk and vinegar mixture with great results. (Maybe if I stop feeding them they'll stop coming...:)

Very good.

I tripled the topping and put 2 x's in the middle and 1 x's on the top.

Great Recipe!  Made a little of the extra topping but next time I'll probably double it and put some in the middle.  Definitely a keeper and a family tradition.  Thanks!

Wow, this is probably the first time I've ever tried to make bread without a bread machine and it turned out really good. I ate it while it was still hot and I love the way that it just sort of steamed as I sliced it. I followed the other reviewers suggestions and also doubled the amount of topping and added half in the middle of the loaf. Also had to cook it slightly longer than the recipe calls for.

Delicious. I didn't have buttermilk or vinegar so just used regular milk and it was fine. Very easy and fast to make.

This is such an extremely versatile recipe!  It is fabulous just spread with butter and equally delicious with a glaze.  I think I might also add chopped apples or raisins and chopped pecans or walnuts next time.  I used a small bundt pan and baked for 30-35 min.  Had just a bit of trouble getting it out but with a little patience, it didn't break.  Thank-you for sharing!

Great recipe...will definitely make again! The aroma was fantastic.
I did double the topping and used brown sugar...also soured milk instead of buttermilk...because then all the ingredients are in the house without going shopping.

The best part is definitely the topping.  I think I must have about quintupled the topping, as I just melted a big stick of butter and added sugar and cinnamon until it crumbled.  I put half in the middle, half on top, and that's where it stayed!  This is a keeper, and I'll make it for breakfast again.

My family loved this, even my picky 2 year old ate it.  I scaled down to 8 because my pan was smaller and it was the perfect amount for the pan, although not enough for us.  We could have ate 2!!  I will be making this again.  I will try a small amount of sour cream to make a bit more moist.  Thanks for the very quick, easy and tasty recipe.

Very dry and tasteless.  This wasn't the best cinnamon bread that I've ever had.  This tasted more like a cinnamon biscuit with out glaze.  I don't think that I'll make this bread again.

I make this in "mini" loaf pans.  Double or more of the cinnamon topping and put half the topping in the middle of the bread as well as on top. A little powdered sugar icing drizzled on the top. Very good recipe!!!  Doesn't last a day in my house!!

Wonderful!  I had no problems with spilling over.  I did put a cookie sheet on the rack underneath, just in case.  I also took the advice of other reviewers and used a combo of brown and white sugar for the topping and used it in the middle as well.  I also made the great Honey Butter by Shannon.  I added some cinnamon to that as well.  Thank you Carol for something I will make over and over!!

Excellent.  I read some helpful reviews prior to making it.  
First, I put it in a bundt pan so it had plenty of room to rise without spilling over.
I put half the bread mixture in then sprinkled sugar/cinnamon mix and put the rest of the bread mixture on.  I did double the topping mixture and that made it much better.  
Also, mixing the wet and dry separately then mixing them together is a good idea.  
It is delicious.

I doubled the topping and the bread was still bland, bland, bland. The topping does not swirl into the batter well. You are left with a crumb top that gets all over everything when you take it out of the pan or cut it. Stick to coffee cake.

This bread was very easy, quick and delicious. I used the milk w/ vinegar instead of buttermilk.  The topping was swirled into the mix with a knife and worked just fine - no sinking to the bottom and perfect swirls appeared.  TIP: I bake EVERYTHING in the appropriate container then place on top of an insulated cookie sheet and have always had excellent results with any recipe.  Hope that helps.

So much yum! I followed the tips in the reviews: mixed the dry ingredients and wet ingredients separately, and tripled the topping. I used brown sugar in the topping instead of granulated sugar, though I think next time I might just use the granulated. Dont think the switch made that much difference.
I added 1/2 the batter to the loaf pan, sprinkled 1/3 of the topping and swirled lightly with a fork, added the 2nd half of the batter and then the rest of the topping. The house smelled wonderful while it baked! The aroma lured three sleepy teenaged boys out of bed, which is no small feat! 
Thanks for a great recipe, and to all the reviewers who added their helpful tips.

Fantastic! I actually made this vegan and gluten free by subbing for a flour mix, flax eggs, margarine, and coconut milk (soured with ACV, and it is great! Very dense, moist, and flavorful.

Yum! So good! It was like a coffee cake, but with the texture of bread. Honestly delicious and so easy to make. The topping seemed fine for me, yes I would have liked a little more, but it wasn't a problem. Also much healthier compared to coffee cake, but without all the hassle of letting bread rise. Perfect!

I can't give five stars yet as the bread is still in the oven but goodness gracious, does my house smell incredible. That and the batter was about the best I've tried (I am a batter connoisseur!). Will follow with a formal review but I'm on baking cloud nine and I still have 30 minutes to go!

We love it!  I had to make 2 of them within two days... my carb-hating husband ate over 1/2 of it the first night.  The only thing I did different was to double the filling and add the extra to the middle.

This bread is not for me. Going with the ratings I really thought it was going to be a winner. It smelled good while cooking. My husband even commented on the aroma. I know I put the cinnamon in the recipe but it didn't taste like cinnamon. As a matter of fact it was bland with no taste & verrry dry. Big disappointment and a waste of ingredients.

This bread was...good. Made a few changes: I mixed the dry ingredients first, then slowly mixed in the wet, only stir until blended. I doubled the cinnamon topping as other suggested. I put 1/2 of the cinnamon mix in the middle, and the rest on the top. Bread took a little longer to bake than stated - about 60 minutes. 
The bread was not bad, though I felt it was bland. Hubby thought it was great, but he is an easy eater! It was very moist, borderline too-moist (gooey, though fully baked). 
Overall, we will finish the loaf, but I will probably not make this again unless I adjust it to add more flavor.

This bread was amazing!!! The only changes I made, from reading other reviews was to increase the topping and put some in the middle. I did do 2 tablespoons of white sugar for that, and 2 tablespoons of brown sugar. My kids loved it as well. I usaully make another cinnamon bread from this site, but I think this one will be my new one! Thanks alot.

What a delicious, light (feeling) treat.  Dagnabbit, I ate half the loaf.  Note to self, make sure family is here when I make the next loaf.  :)  Yum!

I did use apple sauce in place of the oil and doubled the topping - genius.

This was great!  I made it dairy-free by using rice milk (with the vinegar trick) and Earth Balance.  Also white whole wheat flour, decreased sugar to 3/4 cup and a combo of white and brown (all brown for the topping, which I doubled as per other raters). Last sub was applesauce for half the oil.  Delicious!

I was going to mix this the way a quick bread should be instead of all in one bowl, but then I ran out of time, and followed the recipe exactlly, and was really impressed! We ate it as an afternoon snack, straight from the oven, and my kids loved it. Nice and moist, cut well straight from the oven! Next time I will probably mix it more traditionally, and will double the topping, maybe even throw in some apple chunks, but this was tasty and hit the spot as it's written!

I doubled the swirl portion of the bread.  I substituted some of the white sugar with brown sugar.  I poured some of the bread mixture in the pan then added some of the "swirl"; I "swirled" it in at that point (should NOT have done that step); then I added the rest of the bread mixture and topped with the remaining "swirl" mixture.  It took 55 minutes and the first swirl portion was too close to the bottom of the pan, so it has carmelized in some spots.  Taste is amazing though and I will make this one again.  It tasted great while warm with some butter spread on it.

Very tasty. (: Instead of the vegetable oil I used applesauce, which I think helps make a much more moist bread. I also made my own topping. Equal parts butter, white sugar, brown sugar & oats. In this case 1/8 of a cup of each. I also poured half the batter then swirled half of the topping into that then poured the rest of my batter & crumbled the remaining topping.

This was moist, not oily, and not too crumbly!  I followed others' advice and separately mixed wet and dry before combining.  I also tripled the "topping" and put it in random dollops onto half the batter, covered it, and put more random dollops on top.  I then topped the whole cake with brown sugar and pecans.  It required 58 minutes of baking.  Oh, and I used half whole wheat flour so that it would have at least one redeeming health quality :)  It came out wonderfully and it was gone within minutes at my office.

Excellent served warm with coffee flavor ice cream.

Excellent!  I left out the oil and added in non fat vanilla yogurt instead.  I also wanted it less sweet, so I changed it to 1/3 cup sugar and 1/3 cup agave nectar.  Finally, I added a dash of nutmeg into the cinnamon swirl.  This recipe is a keeper!

I made this today, almost exactly as the recipe calls for  except as I added a little homemade applesauce and opted not for the topping. It turned out very well and taste really good, is a really good basic recipe for adding flavorful jams, jellies, etc.

The kids loved this.  I went ahead and doubled the topping, putting 1/2 in the middle and some on top.  I, personally, still found this bread to be a little bland.  However, I think I can play with the recipe to get it to my taste :)  Thanks for sharing!

I've made this recipe a couple of times now, and I think it is great. I add extra cinnamon to the batter as I can't have enough cinnamon flavor in my bread. Other than that, this one is a keeper!

I made the recipe following SNOWAYNGEL's modifications.  In particular, I think doubling the topping to include in the center of the bread makes a huge difference.  My 7 yr old son (who loves cinnamon) raved about it and said, "It's perfect, mom!"  The bread is moist and yummy with a bit of a crusty top. It's very pretty, too -- it would make a lovely gift.

This recipe was pretty good!!  I don't like things very sweet and this one isn't super sweet.  But I even thought it needed a little more sugar.  My kids like desserts to be very sweet so they thought it a little too bland. I also took the advice of doubling or if you want it sweeter, triple the topping.  Using brown sugar instead of white gives it a great flavor.  I also advise that you add lots of butter to the topping!!  :) it helps keep it moist.  So this is an overall good recipe!!  Thanks for the recipe!!! :D

Loved this bread! I doubled the streusel topping, per other reviewers, putting half in the middle and half on top, and subbing brown sugar. I used half ww and half ap flour, and subbed 1/3 c applesauce for the oil. Mixed teh wet and dry ingredients separately and baked in a Bundt pan for 50 minutes, and it was absolutely perfect! The texture was exactly what I would expect from a quick bread. The house smelled wonderful while it was baking, and the end result was very tasty, just sweet enough, with a little crunch from the streusel. Thanks!

Great recipe! I followed the advice of mixing dry ingredients and wet ingredients seperately first. I did not use an electric mixer just a spoon and it turned out GREAT. It rose so well and tasted great. I will keep this recipe and definitely make it again and again. Thank you for such a wonderful recipe.

We enjoyed this bread very much.  I substituted plain yogurt for the buttermilk and it worked great.  The flavor kind of reminds me of Amish Friendship bread (without the hassle), and it makes the house smell wonderful while baking!  Simple and delicious, a keeper.

This recipe is great!  Just sweet enough.  I did as others suggested and tripled the topping....it made alot...I only used half of it.  But luckily the kids like it so much that i made another one a few days later and used the rest.  I didn't cook a whole hour (had to leave the house) but it turned out just right.   I mixed dry and wet ingredients separately then added the dry to the wet.    Great easy bread than can be a morning snack (great w/ butter) or sweet enough for dessert (warm it up).  Also good b/c these are ingredients that are always on hand.

I ended up making these into muffins, which was great because the cooking time was cut down by half.  I baked them for 23 minutes.  YUMMY!! A little too sweet for breakfast, but def a great snack!

This bread is soooo yummy! I doubled the topping and swirled half in it as the recipe said, and I put the other half on top! MMMMM..... I am making this again soon! Update: I forgot to say that I didn't have any buttermilk so I used 1 cup of milk  and 1 3/4ths teaspoon of cream of tarter. Worked out great!

I made this with whole wheat flour, doubled the batch and used only 3/4 cup of sugar for the whole thing. I used 1 egg and 4 egg whites, half olive oil and half apple sauce, and i added raisons and apple. I also coated the pan with the cinnamon and sugar mixture. Fantastic and healthy! i have already made this 3 times :) TIP: i like to turn the cooking time down to 300 and bake for one hour because it seems to produce a more moist bread.

I made this cinnamon bread a few hours ago and my family is inhaling it. What a great recipe!! The only changes I made was double the streusel topping and swirled half into the bread, and half on top I also tossed in a handful of walnuts. Some reviewers mentioned it overflowing or needing multiple pans, so I baked it in a bundt pan and it came out great. I'm already being asked to bake another!

My family loved this recipe.  I used half sugar/half splenda and half all purpose flour/half Whole wheat flour.  Everything turned out great and we really enjoyed it.

Had my 14 year old grandson make this for the family this gray Sunday morning in West Va. It was sooo easy. He tried both the recommended crumb batch on one loaf and the 3x crumb batch on the second loaf. Everyone agreed the 3x crumb batch was the winner. He used 4 small loaf pans on the second batch. This worked well also.

Yummy.  I didn't have any buttermilk, so I used the old trick of adding 1 T. vinegar and enough milk to make 1 c.  I doubled the topping, using brown sugar as suggested by others.  And I sprinkled half in the middle and the other half on top.  It was perfectly done after 50 minutes.

This was excellent!  I made it first exactly as directed and taking advice from previous reviewers regarding mixing the wet and dry ingredients separately and doubling the topping.  That added more topping, but I don't think it was necessarily an improvement because the bread itself was delicious even without the topping.  I made this to give to our neighbors for Christmas, but after it make my kitchen smell so good, I decided to mix a second loaf to keep.  By the second loaf, I was busy and forgot to do a couple things.  The first time, I mixed the dry and wet ingredients separately and they blended perfectly when I combined the wet and dry.  But the second time, I was just on a roll dumping stuff in and mixed it all in one bowl without thinking.  This made it very lumpy.  I also forgot to grease the pan the second go 'round, and even though I used a silicone pan, it did stick and came out with a piece missing.  So as long as you mix the dry and wet ingredients separately, and don't forget to grease your pan, you will do great!  I am thinking maybe a few others said this was bland because they expected a sweet and gooey cinnamon roll texture?  Not sure what their expectations were, but this has more of a coffee cake or banana bread texture, and it was perfectly sweet.  I don't think it needed any more.  I may try it with chopped apples and/or pecans in the future for a change.  My kids love cinnamon bread that we buy at the grocery, but no need to buy that anymore.  I will b

I should have paid more attention to the neutral/negative reviews for this recipe. I used about 2.5 tsp of cinnamon in the batter, and doubled the topping, but something in the flavor is lacking... I'm not enough of a baker to know what that is. I'm not a fan of the texture - it is almost chewy, and not what I would expect from a quick bread. I saw that another reviewer used this for bread pudding. I'm going to try that tomorrow, but alone this bread just isn't that great. I'm disappointed because I love cinnamon bread and it smelled so great while it was cooking.

Good bread, and easy enough.  I really like cinnamon so I was surprised when I wasn't ecstatic about a bread where it is the star. Followed the recipe, and then after trying a slice, I added a powdered sugar glaze which I think helped.  I don't know if I would make it again though.  The house did smell heavenly while baking.  **NOTE** I took this out after 45 minutes and let it cool completely in the pan.  Maybe baking too long is what's causing other reviewers to experience dry bread.

This is a divine loaf, more cake than bread. The topping does tend to sink so I'll follow the advice of others and place it in the middle next time. I also made my own buttermilk: 1 teaspoon vinegar to 1 cup milk.

This turned out moist but I think it needs more cinnamon flavor and definitely more stuff on top.  I was scared because the batter was so runny that it wasn't going to bake right but it turned out the perfect consistency.

Excellent texture and taste. I added 3/4 cup toasted coconut and everyone loved it. I doubled it and baked it in a 9 X 13 pan and had it as a coffee cake instead of a loaf. Will be making again!!

Made exactly as directed, I would say that the bread came out about average.  I would suggest doubling the crumb topping (which also I noted was more of a paste than a crumb...could use a teaspoon of flour or something in there).  It really needs it for the extra sweetness.  I think next time I would add more sugar to the recipe, a little more cinnamon and double the crumb topping so that it tastes better.

A very easy recipe, and a nice not-overly-sweet bread - although I did use roughly 1/2c of sugar instead of the suggested 1 c., and replaced the oil with apple sauce.  This will get made a lot here.

This is a really nice recipe. This bread comes out moist and everyone in my family really enoyed it. The only problem is that it's so addictive! In my oven, I have to bake it for 70 minutes to make sure it's completely ready on the inside and I don't mix the cinnamon mixture TOO much because I like the marble affect but overall, this is a really tasty loaf.

This bread was absolutely perfect. EVERYTHING a cinnamon bread should be. Instead of buttermilk, I used vanilla yougurt thinned with a little regular milk. The bread turned out perfect in exactly 50 min. It was flavorful, moist, and tasty. Perfect with a little butter spread on a slice, warm from the oven or microwave.  Even the picky young one in my family love this! A+
NOTE: the crumb topping really requires another teaspoon or so of sugar. Extra cinnamon in the batter went into mine as well.

Wonderful! My husband and I loved this bread, it has an excellent flavor. I used the milk/vinegar mixture, mixed everything at once as directed, and also added about 1/2 cup of chopped pecans. The only problem I had was with the topping--it was too moist to crumble easily, and it created moist pockets of batter right under the top crust that added about 15 minutes of cooking time. I think the topping was my fault though; I believe I used more than 2 teaspoons of butter. Next time I make it I will be more careful about measuring the butter portion. Thanks for a great and easy recipe!

A very good basic recipe. I especially like the fact that you can make it with stuff that's always on hand. I did make some modifications the second time I tried this, with very good results; as suggested by a lot of reviewers, I substituted dark brown sugar for the white in the topping. I also added 1 chopped granny smith apple, since the first time around this came out a bit dry, and I increased the cinnamon to 1 tablespoon, and added a teaspoon of allspice. It was way more moist and flavorful the second time around.

THIS BREAD WAS WONDERFUL!  I MADE IT FOR A LOAN OFFICERS MEETING AT WORK AND THERE WASN'T EVEN A CRUMB LEFT.  I DID TRIPLE THE CINNAMON MIXTURE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE RECIPE AND REDUCED THE CINNAMON IN THE BATTER.  I PUT 1/2 OF BATTER, 1/2 OF THE CINNAMON MIXTURE, BATTER AND REMAINING CINNAMON MIXTURE ON TOP-THEN SWIRLED IT WITH A KNIFE.

This was great. The only thing that I had a slight problem with was the size it was when it came out. It would have been easier to split the dough in half and bake. The topping didn't work well for me. I mixed it too long. I do plan on making this again. I didn't do anything different than what the recipe says and it tasted fine.

This was good.  I doubled the brown sugar topping & mixed in middle layer as reviewers suggested.  i will probably make again as i always have these ingredients on hand.  However, next time i might add nuts or chocolate chips w/ the topping.

This turned out great!  I haven't restocked my kitchen since Christmas, so I had to sub brown sugar and it still turned out very nice.  My parents and I ate half of it before it even cooled.  Will definitely make again!

Good bread! I, like others doubled the topping recipe. I also added nuts and doubled the cinnamon in the bread. I used a 9X5 pan and baked for 50 minutes. Moist and wonderful!I had an unannounced guest as it was baking and she said, "My, does your home always smell this nice?"

AWESOME RECIPE! This is a very simple bread, not a lot of ingredients. My husband (very picky) loves this, so does my son. Its soooo goos they demand it almost daily! For buttermilk I se a buttermilk powder (in baking section of supermarkets) - just add 4 tblsp. of powder to recipes dry ingredients and a cup of water to the wet - works great! Will DEFINITELY make this again and again

Great recipe!  It was my first try at bread-making so I am glad to have had so much success.  Also, thanks for the tip about using vinegar with milk in place of buttermilk.  I have used it in other recipes as a substitute and it works really well. Thanks for the great recipes!  It's definitely one of our favorites!

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great!!   The only problem was that it didn't last very long.  I live alone and the loaf was gone in 2 days.

I really liked this bread. It has the consistency of banana bread but with a pleasantly sweet cinnamon flavor. I have made this swapping brown sugar in place of streusel, and it still comes out marvelous. Wonderful go-to bread. Nice mild flavor to enjoy with coffee or tea.

This is delicious and it was easy, too.  I used Greek yogurt instead of oil just because that's what I usually do.  And I cut the sugar by 1/4 cup because I want to eat this for breakfast and hope to avoid some of the sugar crash :) .  I added 1/4 scoop of protein powder, too, to make this a better breakfast option for me.

This bread is very light and moist! I made it differently than the directions stated. I beat the cup of sugar with the oil, eggs and vanilla first. Then I mixed the dry ingredients together and added those to the eggs and sugar mixture and lastly added the milk. I also doubled the sugar cinnamon mixture and added half of it to half of the pan, then the rest to the top of the bread. It is delicious!

This is a good cinnamon bread recipe. I've put my own twist on it... I substituted 1/2&1/2 with a 1/4 tsp lemon juice for buttermilk 1 Tblspn vanilla and buckwheat for the white flour (sometimes I'll add raisins and walnuts) and the topping brown sugar, butter and cinnamon. It's a staple at our house

I am making this for the first time as a Christmas gift, and it's in the oven right now! Therefore I can't yet vouch for the finished product. 
I am nervous based on the wildly mixed reviews. I did mix the dry and wet ingredients separately, to include mixing the sugar with the wet ingredients. I combined the dry with the wet with a spoon, just until moistened. It seems crazy to me  the original recipe called for mixing them all at once? I also doubled the topping and put some in the middle based on previous reviews. I will give an update once it passes the taste test.

Update: I was disappointed in this recipe. Fortunately I was not able to gift the loaf as intended. I ate a few slices. It was quite dry, surprising considering its heftiness. I am a decent cook and baker. I will not make this again.

The cinnamon bread is delicious and I plan on making each one of my neighbors a loaf for Christmas. I did make a few changes to the recipe to cut sugar and calories, and  to add some fiber. I replaced 1cup of the white flour with 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 2 T. Flax Seed meal, Stevia in the Raw for the white sugar, and egg whites for whole eggs.

SO good! I followed the advice of several of the others and mixed wet ingredients first, then added dry, stirring to mix well. I also substituted the white sugar in the topping with brown sugar and then baked it in a bundt pan, which reduced the cooking time a bit. I started checking it around 40 minutes. My granddaughter wanted a powdered sugar glaze, so we added a very thin film of that. It is definitely a keeper and the house smelled wonderful! Thank you!

Never made bread of any type ever, so of course I don't have a loaf pan ?? Used a 9x13 pan. Simple to make and came out good! Next time will add raisins & walnuts? Oh and will have a loaf pan by then?

Delicious and quick to make.  I mixed the dry ingredients and wet ingredients separately before combining and only stirred until combined (like muffins).  I also doubled the topping and put half in the middle and the rest on top.  It turned out just great. I will make this again.

Mixed wet and added to dry just until incorporated. I used half whole wheat pastry flour, added 3 T ground flax, doubled topping and used part on interior and baked 35 minutes in Bundt pan.

Simple to make. I followed the vinegar plus milk substitute for buttermilk. Instead of using veggie oil, I used coconut oil. I didn't have all purpose flour, so I used rice flour. I also didn't have baking powder, so I just doubled the baking soda and added the same amount as salt. Turned out absolutely delicious!

I made this and doubled the topping for extra sweet cinnamon goodness. I put half into the center and the rest on the BOTTOM of a Bundt pan for presentation. My loaf pans are small and I didn't want this to cook over. I also combined dry and wet ingredients separately and then combined them. Delicious!

I made this recipe exactly, while using the tip on how to make regular milk into butter milk with vinegar. When baking, it took about 10 minutes longer to fully cook through. I didn't think it was too sweet and the topping amount was just right.

What makes this recipe a winner is that its a breakfast bread with ingredients readily available in the pantry vs. banana or zucchini bread.

I loved this recipe. It is really simple, and the end result is delicious. I usually do make some changes, however. It's a small change, but when I am measuring out the cinnamon for both the topping and the bread, I do not level the spoon. My family and I love cinnamon, so the extra cinnamon, in our opinions, makes it much better. I also triple the topping, because I find that it's the best part of the recipe and adds a great flavor. However, since this is a quick bread, as other people have said, you should not mix it for 3 minutes. Combine the dry ingredients in one bowl, and the wet in something like a measuring cup. Blend the wet ingredients until the eggs are mostly beaten. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix, using a whisk, just until combined.  Make sure you mix the batter from the bottom up. The batter will be thick, I promise. It always is for me. As for the topping, I usually use butter instead of margarine, but either works fine. I also use half brown sugar and half granulated sugar, then I mix the sugars with the cinnamon using my hands to break up any lumps of brown sugar. Then I add the butter and squash it in using a fork. Like I said, I triple the topping recipe. I add all the topping on top and swirl it with a knife. I think giving out loaves of these baked in mini loaf pans would be a lovely homemade gift, if you're looking to give someone something special.

Followed a lot of the comments.  Used brown sugar instead of regular, separately mixed dry and wet ingredients, and slowly mixed together little by little.  Tripled the topping and mixed it into the batter as I poured it into the pan.  Baked for about an hour and ten.  Turned out a perfect consistency and very moist.  Yummy!

Great recipe! I used brown sugar instead of white. I also substituted butter milk for 1/4 cup milk with 3/4 cup yogurt. I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the topping. Again here, I used brown sugar and butter. The results were amazing! really loved it. Moist, soft and tasty. the cinnamon flavour was super cool!

This was excellent and easy. Mixed wet and dry ingredients separately, then stirred together just until blended (as you should for any quick bread). I doubled it and put 1/2 in a stoneware loaf pan and 1/2 in a bunt pan. For both I put 1/2 the topping in the middle of the batter and 1/2 on top. (I did NOT double the topping as many have suggested, though I did use brown instead of white sugar. It was plenty cinnamony and sweet.) I didn't even have butter or margarine, so I used a honey walnut cream cheese spread in the topping. 50 minutes for the bunt, 60 for the stoneware. I happened to be eating a whipped strawberry yogurt for breakfast when I ate this bread...spread it on top of my slice and it was an awesome combo!

I received nothing but compliments on this recipe. I agree with other reviewers that the topping should have been doubled. I didn't get the swirl I would've liked the first time 'round. Nevertheless, the bread was so yummy and moist. I'll definitely be making it for my family again!

Made this recipe for the 1st time today. Read the reviews,followed the tips: separated wet & dry ingredients, didn't have buttermilk or vinegar, so used reg. milk plus 1 TBSP lemon juice, doubled the toppings, swirled some in the middle, substituted brown sugar for part of the white and used a bigger pan than my loaf pan. It was done at 40 minutes, perhaps the size of the pan, larger and shallower than a loaf pan. It came out...perfectly delicious! So easy to make, clean up also a breeze and we LOVED this bread-cake-yummy dish. Because this turned out so well I'm going to make several small "loaves" for Christmas gifts.

I thought this recipe was really good... for those who said it didn't have flavor I disagree it is supposed to taste like cinnamon and that it does... a nice cinnamon vanilla flavor... I do agree that the sugar cinnamon swirl should be doubled... I did combine the dry and wet ingredients separately too... Next time I want to try replacing the oil with applesauce and cutting back on the sugar... to make it healthier.... walnuts or even raisins might also be a good addition but not necessary...

recipe overflowed loaf pan. and then it fell apart when we tried to take it out. also, although i think this was probably a good recipe if one of the commentators rewrote it, as written, it's not very good.

I made muffins with this recipe, used applesauce instead of oil. Added extra cinnamon, and used 3/4 cup of white sugar and half a cup of brown. Didn't use topping. Made cream cheese icing.  It came out really well. I think the recipe would be super w/o the tweaks. Thanks for a great recipe!

Thank you for this recipe this bread was great!  i made a few changes though!  I added fresh cranberries to the batter(trying to use up the left overs from the hollidays) I put all of the batter into a 8x8 pan and made a strussel for the top(coffee cake style)!  though i made some minor changes to the recipe, I left the cake part unchanged and it was delicious!

It was ok. It baked up perfectly and exactly 50 minutes. The texture was right on. The flavor is exactly what you think it would be. I just didn't care for it but my 2 yr old loved it.

This bread was EXCELLENT!!!! simply delicious.  I took another reviewer's suggestions and substituted brown sugar for the white sugar in the topping (which i doubled).  I also poured half off the batter into my loaf pan, swirled half the topping in, then repeated.  Since I used a glass pan it took a bit longer to cook, probably more like an hour... BUT WELL WORTH THE WAIT!!! my family didn't talk for several minutes after I served this as we were all too busy eating!  very good recipe, something i will make again; next time with some raisins or nuts sprinkled in.

To die for!  I baked it in a bundt pan and it looked as good as it tasted.  The only modification I made was to add more cinnamon/sugar than recipe called for.  Will definitely make this again!

Delicious breakfast bread.  A great way to use up some extra buttermilk.  Increasing the cinnamon sugar mixture is definitely the way to go.

A keeper!  For buttermilk I used  1 T vinegar then fill to 1 C line w/ whole milk and let sit 10 minutes.  Mix dry ingrediants. Add eggs, vanilla, and melted butter (instead of oil) to the milk and mix.  Slowly add wet to dry until just mixed through...no more!  Then I added half batter to greased pan, cover with 2 T Turbinado Sugar and 1 tsp cinnamon.  Added rest of batter, and topped again with 2 T Turbinado Sugar and 1 tsp cinnamon, swirl with knife and bake.  Very good!  I also use Vietnamese Cinnamon...try it for baking and you will never go back! Oh and I use half whole wheat and half white flour for personal preference especially with bread.

This is a great loaf to serve at breakfast or for coffee time. I would highly recommend doubling the crumb topping. Pour half the batter into a loaf pan: sprinkle half the crumb mixture. Pour the remaining batter and top with rest of crumb mixture. A good recipe that you can easily play around with!

This bread is scrumptious! I made this recipe to the T and it came out beautifully. The only thing is that I had to cook it for about 20 to 30 minutes longer than the described time. But no big deal because the whole family gobbled over half of it in one night! Plus, I made one the next day for Mother's Day, but doubling the streusel. This definitely a keeper.

I made this today and it was awesome!  I had to substitute for buttermilk but it came out great.  This is an extremely easy recipe you should try.  I also doubled the topping and put half of it in the middle of the bread.  I also greased the inside of the pan and sprinkled some cinnamon around the edges.  Try this and you won't be sorry no matter how you make it.

This was so yummy. Like other people I double the topping and put some in the middle. The only thing is i had to add 10 extra min to the time and I think it made the corners"extra brown" But all in all it was delicious.

This recipe needs some tweaking. Always mix your dry ingrediants seperatly from your wet ingrediants, and then fold your dry gently into your wet being careful not to overmix. The bread was a bit dry to me, though the taste was nice.

Well, I just made this in four mini-loaf pans for Christmas gifts. One of the four was a "tester", so we could be sure it tasted good before we gave it away. My two sons took a taste and declared  "Epic Win!!"

I thought these were delicious.. and so did my family! The only thing was I didn't think there was enough crumbles so I doubled it. I also put half of them in the center. The 50 minutes was the perfect amount of time. Thanks!

Really not a fan. Not what I expected from a cinnamon bread recipe - especially one that included buttermilk (which tends to lend a more moist texture to the bread). Following the recipe exactly yielded a sub-par bread that leaves me searching for another one to use for next time. Heavy and dry - not sweet, moist and delicious as I hoped.

This is simple and fast to make. I also always have all the ingredients on hand. This is my go to recipe when I want to bake but not run to the store. The best part is it tastes good too!

I love this bread, it is very dense.  It's almost more like a pound cake.  I bake in a bundt pan and always double the filling (putting 1/2 in the middle of the batter and 1/2 on top).  I also normally do a simple glaze.  After greasing the pan with butter I dust with cinnamon sugar which creates a tasty crunchy exterior.

Absolutely love this bread!  I have tried some of the suggestions listed and find that the original directions make the best loaf.  I make this once a week and the kids call it "mom's good bread".  Love it.

I was out of the usual fruits to make a sweet bread and tried this one morning for breakfast. My family and I loved it and I continue to make it for them as an inexpensive treat.

This was...different, I guess. It was hard to say whether or not it's actually bread or cake. It came out pretty dense, and the texture was almost rubbery. I mixed dry, mixed wet, then added together and stirred until combined; I did sub applesauce for oil so maybe that was part of it? I don't know...it's edible, but I probably won't make it again.

I made this and doubled the cinnamon crumble recipe, used sour cream instead of buttermilk, and also used 1 tsp. vanilla and 1 tsp. almond extract to give it a little more sweetness! LOVED IT! And the compliments on how great it was also helped! ;)

The flavor was great, but the problem I had was that the cinnamon swirl mixture kind of clumped. It baked fine, but it would have been better if the mixture was a little more "loose." Great recipe.

I've made this bread twice now.  The first was a disaster because it bubbled over the pan and made quite the mess.  The second time I split the batter into two pans and had better results.  The bread tastes pretty good, but the texture is a bit rubbery.  I'm not sure if I will give it another go or not.

This is a wonderful recipe! I made it tonight to have for breakfast company we are having in the morning. The entire house smelled warm and great! Needless to say, my husband tore right into it while it was still HOT and I had to make another one. This will be used again and again. It was not overly sweet and tastes great with a warm cup of coffee.

This bread was very good!  I stuck with the original recipe and it was great! It is a well-balanced recipe--no need changing. I did out of curiosity try it as suggested, doubling the topping, and it DID NOT taste very good.  The cinnamon became WAY too powerful almost to the point of bitter because of the excess cinnamon.  So with this recipe, DO follow it to the T.  THe only change I made is by adding walnuts into it and the method of mixing.  I mix all dry first and then mix the liquids just until MOISTENED.  This will make the texture more "bready" and make it nice and soft as well.  Maybe thats why some reviewers bread turned out dry.  Try not over mixing it.  It should do the trick.  If you find it in the bland side, you just probably like things jazzed up.  In that case, go ahead and add raisins or something to it. This is a Cinnamon Bread recipe, I dont understand why some people making this are expecting it to be anything more.

I thought this was very good, will continute to make it, and have shared the recipe with several friends.   The first bread I made the other night with my niece-I supplied the majority of the ingred, but my sis did not have enough sugar for the topping. I had to refrigerate the batter until she came home. I tripled the sugar mixture, put about 2/3 in the middle and the rest on top. I tried it at 300 for 1 hr..this did not work. It overflowed in the pan, and took longer than 1 hr.   I made this again in MY oven on Fri, except this time I think I had a little too much butter in the sugar topping and it was 'sticky'. I dropped by 1/2 spoonfuls on the batter for the middle, (didn't swirl it this time) then again on top. This came out real well. Next time I might make more, and just try to spread it over..(the BF really liked this part!) Also, per BF request, I made a confectioner's sugar glaze and spread that over the remaining half of the loaf (BR has eaten 1/2 already). I did have slice of both of them, and thought the flavor was VERY good! I toasted my slice this morning.   Thank you for a very good recipe (the original)! I usually don't like when people feel the need to change up poster's recipes, but I think the additon of the sugar mixture in the middle defintely pumps this up!

It tasted good, but the end product looked strange. The batter overflowed in oven, and I had to bake it an extra 30 minutes because the middle would not cook. As a result, the ends rose, but the middle did not. Next time, I will use a cake pan instead a loaf pan, or split the batter between two loaf pans.

I thought this was super tasty. I didn't have buttermilk, so I soured milk with a little lemon, and it was fantastic this way. I did go ahead and double the topping and sprinkle some in the center as well as the top, and it came out with a nice cinnamon-sugar swirl! It's a keeper!

Nice Cinnamon bread.  It was more mild than I had thought it would be.  I followed the recommendations of other reviewers and doubled the topping and added part to the center and followed by the remaining batter.  I also separated the dry ingredients and then added those to the wet ones.  The house smelled great while it was baking!

I baked these in 4 mini loaves and gave them as gifts. Everyone loved them. I reduced the baking time because of the size and it worked out great. I also mixed the dry and wet ingredients separately. I think I may have baked it a tad too long or not used quite enough buttermilk because it was a bit dry, that's why I gave it 4 stars.

Was a bit crusty/hard on outside and spongy on inside... would have liked it to be a little more bready. I did not mix the wet and dry ingredients separately but next time definitely will.

Delicious!! I made this last night using the milk/lemon juice substitution for the buttermilk and it turned out fabulously! I also doubled the streusel topping as others had suggested and used half of it in the middle of the bread and the other half on top. I think next time I will triple that part because it's sooooo yummy. This will definitely become a much-used recipe in our house.

I made this bread yesterday and it was a huge success. I used triple the topping and it turned out not too sweet. I also sprinkled some nutmeg in the flour mixture. I will be baking this again soon. oh and I also used the vineger method. I used apple cider and it did not seem to make a differenc thank you for sharing a really good quick bread.

This was very good and so easy. I did milk/vinegar version. I did double the topping and crumbled half in the middle of the loaf. I used half brown and half white sugar in topping as well as dough. I mixed sugar and cinnamon together and sugared my pan instead of flouring it. No problems with sticking at all. And this bread get more moistured the more it sits in fridge. Thanks for rec.

Am I the only one who had trouble with the crumb mixture?  I used cold butter and even tried adding some flour.  Any of the "crumb" mixture that I swirled in the bread sunk to the bottom but what was left on top stayed on top. Good, though, overall.

This is a really nice quick bread!  I think it has the right amount of cinnamon, however I did increase the topping by double.  I sprinkled cinnamon-sugar on the sides & bottom of a greased bundt pan.  I put half the batter in and put 1/2 of the topping mixture on and swirled it a bit and pour the remaining batter in and topped that off with the last 1/2 of the topping.  The bake time was right on 50 min. in the bundt pan!  My family really enjoyed this.  I spread some "All Day Apple Butter" (from this site) on my slice and it was D-lish!  THX.

This was easy and delicious. I used the milk and vinager, and it came out good. The topping threw me off a little because it was sticky and sunk into the cake, so I swirled the best I could.I definatley could have doubled the topping.

This is simply delicious.  My oven isn't working but I have been dying to try out the bread machine.  I just put all the ingredients (minus the topping ingredients) into the bread machine and it did all the work.  I did use 2 tsp of cinnamon instead of 1.5tsp and used regular 2% milk instead of buttermilk. Our result was a nice, moist, sweet dessert bread.  DELISH!!

This makes a great cinnamon bread!  Tip to eliminate overflow:  fill a regular-sized loaf pan two-thirds and a mini loaf pan (5.75"x3"x2"d) two-thirds.  I baked them together - small loaf took 40 minutes, regular sized took 55 min.  Also followed the suggestions for dry & wet ingredients, & doubled the struesel using brown sugar instead of white.  Swirled half into the center & half went on top.  Yum!!

This makes a beautiful, delicious loaf. The amount of cinnamon is just right. I mixed the dry and wet ingredients separately rather than combining all at once. The bread rises quite a bit while baking, and although mine didn't overflow the pan, I placed a cookie sheet underneath the pan. I'll definitely be baking this quick moist and flavorful bread again.

I really liked this cinnamon bread.  I baked it in a slightly smaller loaf pan, so I baked it for about five more minutes.  I thought the strength of the cinnamon flavor was perfect.

The cinnamon flavoring was a little weak.  Had to use a cup of milk with 1 T. lemon juice instead of buttermilk.  Bread turned out a little dry for my taste.

Did I make the same bread others have raved about?  I followed the recipe exactly except I substituted butter for margarine in the topping.  The bread stuck to the pan, and it appears that most of the "topping" sank to the bottom.  It didn't really taste much of cinnamon, and it left an oily feel in my mouth after I ate it.  I would NOT make it again.

Really good recipe.  I didn't have my loaf pan so I tried it in a 9x9 and it came out tasting wonderful... but a little dry.  So, I tried it again and just added a little more vegetable oil and half of an 8oz. package of cream cheese.  Came out super good.  I also added a little more cinnamon than the recipe called for.  Just family preference.  Great recipe.  Easy and tastes so good!

Great recipe! I halved this  and made a slightly smaller loaf, which I added chopped pecans to. I also added 1/4 tsp b. powder. I did not, however, half the topping. I actually added a tablespoon of brown sugar and a handfull of chopped pecans! It was so pretty and perfect with tea and coffee! I'll be using this one again and again.

This bread is great and JUST what I was looking for! A co-worker made something she called Amish Cinnamon Bread several years ago and this is it! I added one box (3.4 oz) of instant vanilla pudding and I used powdered baker's buttermilk (+1 cup water per buttermilk instructions).  I also added 1/4 tsp cinnamon to the batter for a hint of cinnamon to the batter and then I sprinkled cinnamon sugar in the greased pan. As other reviewers have said - be sure the pan is well greased (for best results I use Baker's Joy baking spray or Crisco with flour spray).  My bread also took 67 minutes to bake.  A good way to prevent overbrowing is to loosley place a piece of foil (tent the foil) over the bread after 25 minutes of bake time. Also previous reviewers had suggested I seperated dry and wet ingredients - I placed all dry ingredients in the mixer bowl first, then added the eggs, oil, water and vanilla.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! :0)

Excellent recipe. Very easy to make. Soft and sweet to eat! I could taste more of vanilla than cinnamon. So, I would try with less of the former and more of cinnamon next time.

Yum!  More like a coffee cake, and very good.  I also doubled the topping and put it in the middle.  I made mine into mini loaves and it turned out great.  I also mixed the wet first then the dry ingr., and added pecans.

This bread is so wonderful!  I doubled the recipe and the results were terrific!  So moist and tastey and so so easy! After I had started I realized I was out of vanilla so I used 1 teaspoon butter flavoring and 1 teaspoon maple flavoring -- mmmmm!  Perfect!

Pretty good.  Recipe made 12 cupcake size muffins for me.  Made my own buttermilk using 1 c milk with 1 tbspn lemon juice.  I followed the advice of others and mixed drys and liquids seperately.  For the topping, as suggested, used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar.  I could not get the right consistency, so I melted the topping, let it sit for a minute and then was easily able to marble into the batter.

Another easy favorite of mine. Basically, just dump, mix and bake! Make sure that you sprinkle the topping very thinly over the top of the batter, or else you'll get big clumps of goo in the middle of the bread. Also, buttermilk works best in this recipe, rather than the vinegar/milk substitute.

Just what I was craving - not too sweet, more like a bread than a cake. I used whole wheat bread flour because I like dense bread, and I got a nice thick crust with a very soft middle. I seasoned the dough quite heavily with cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger. I will scale back the sugar a little when I make the next loaf... which will be very soon.

I love cinnamon raison bread and I've been looking for a recipe that doesn't call for yeast. This bread came out delicious! I used about 3 teaspoons cinnamon for the batter and used brown sugar for the topping as well. And I did add some raisins. It cooked perfectly and came out moist and delicious! Bet it'll be even better toasted with some butter!! YUM!

I tried doubling the amount of topping & swirling through, but ended up with bread with soggy spots. Other than that, I doubled the cinnamon in the bread mix, mixed dry and wet ingredients separately before adding them together, and I think it would have been great without the sogginess of the topping. Oh, and I added 3/4 cup chopped walnuts, which worked well.

Awesome recipe. My family liked it so much I ended up having to make it two days in a row. The second time around I made it as muffins, which also worked out great.

This is a wonderful sweet treat with coffee.  I doubled the topping mixture and used brown sugar instead of white.  Baked it in a 9" bundt pan for 45 minutes.  The cake rose well (almost to the top of the pan) and turned out beautifully with a spongy texture.  I bet this would be great with ice cream and whipped cream!

I have mixed feelings about this recipe. It was tasty and we did eat it, but it wasn't what I expected. It wasn't cinnamon bread, but rather "cinnamon batter". I was hoping for a sweet white quick bread with cinnamon swirls. Instead, the bread was as dark as wheat bread and the cinnamon pockets were virtually nonexistent. I even swirled in half again as much of the cinnamon-sugar mixture as the recipe calls for. If I were to make this again, I would leave the cinnamon out of the batter, triple the cinnamon-sugar mixture, and layer it in thirds. Hope this helps!

This very easy recipe results in a nice high loaf of cinnamon bread which will fill your house with a delicious tantalizing fragrance.  I followed my instincts and added more cinnamon than called for - personal taste, an extra 1/2 teapspoon in the mix and 1 tablespoon instead of a teaspoon in the topping.  I'll probably cutdown on the sugar a little the next time I make it though my sweet-toothed husband thinks it's perfect the way it is.

I made this bread this morning while it was raining, snowing out side. The house smelled so good. We love cinnamon so I added extra cinnamon and sugar on the top and also some chopped nuts.It tastes so good with a cup of hot coffee.

This recipe was ok, but not fabulous.  I was expecting more of a coffee cake than a bread and I think that's where I went wrong.  There wasn't anything distinctly wrong with it, it just wasn't what I expected.

A wonderful bread!  It's very moist and has a wonderful texture.  The texture and way it baked up reminded me of banana bread.  I sent a loaf with my boyfriend to work and everyone raved about it!

A very nice recipe. It went together very easily and was a nice change from the usual banana bread. I took some other reviewers advice and tripled the topping, putting about 2/3 of it in the middle of the cake and 1/3 on the top. When it was all swirled together it resulted in a nice hit of the cinnamon/sugar taste in every bite. The house smelled wonderful while it was cooking, and it was just the thing for this cold, blustery day. Will definitely make again.

Definitely one to make over and over again. It freezes well (if you have enough left over to freeze that is!) and has just the right amount of cinnamon and sugar. Good alternative to coffee cakes as I find them too crumbly and dry. Can't say enough good things about this one!

Delicious!  I added a little more cinnamon than the recipe called for, and the recipe turned out fantastic.  The only thing I would do differently next time is maybe put a tad bit less baking powder...but all in all, great!

This was a great bread.  I followed suggestions from many other reviewers. I doubled the sugar and tripled the topping (using brown sugar), layering some of it in the middle.  The topping was not crumbly however.  I had to bread pieces apart rather than sprinkle it.  I think next time I would add some flour or oats to help it crumble more.

This is really good bread!  The texture is nice and it's not too heavy. I did add a little extra cinnamon and brown sugar mixture on top though, which is a nice touch.  My kids are always asking me to make it, so I just started doubling the recipe which also works well.

A wonderful recipe! I tried it for the first time this morning. It wasn't hard to prepare, I followed the recipe exactly, and it came out beautifully. My husband, who normally doesn't like this type of bread, downed two thick slices with butter before I knew what happened. Will definitely make this one again.

Excellent taste! This would be good with raisins or chopped pecans stirred in. I poured the batter into a greased tube pan, and it came out beautifully. I followed the tip in another review and mixed my wet and dry ingredients separately, adding the dry ingredients to the batter last.

This is now one of my favorites to serve with brunch.  The bread is very moist and delicious.  I used powdered buttermilk (its great to keep on hand in the fridge)and the bread came out incredible.  Excellent recipe!

I didnot care for the taste. My three year old daughter took one bite and threw it into the garbage. No one else liked it. I've eaten and made better cinnamon bread.

Yum!!!  Very moist and lots of good cinnamon flavor.  I used the milk and vinegar trick and doubled the crumb mixture.  I may triple it next... we love that cinnamon sugar taste.  My very picky husband even thought it taste better than his mothers!!! :o)  Great treat!!!  Thanks for sharing!

This is my new favorite cinnamon bread.  I love the light texture and the cinnamon/sugar topping.  I too doubled the amount of topping and added layers of it instead of swirling it through. Thank you for submitting this wonderful recipe.

This was very good!  Add a powdered sugar frosting/glaze to the top of the bread and I also added small pieces of golden delicious apples.  Very tasty!  Don't mix the apples in with the dough.   If you just add the apples to the top of the dough before baking, it doesn't seem to sink so much to the bottom of the bread.  I also tripled the topping, although next time I would triple the topping but only double the cinnamon in the topping.  I did the vinegar trick, it worked great.  YUMMY!

This recipe was so quick and easy!! I made it last night for my boyfriend to take to work the next day. I had no problem with the topping sinking to the bottom it was swirled through perfectly. I used really cold butter, so that might have something to do with it. I topped it with cream cheese frosting and it was delicious!!!!

Very good bread.  We don't eat a lot of sweets around our house, so I was looking for a good bread that was extremely sweet.  This is perfect.  Next time I think I will add a bit more cinnamon, but still if you follow the exact recipe you get a very nice loaf of cinnamon bread.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I LOVE cinnamon and this bread is fantastic. I had no problem with the topping... in fact I doubled it and put half in the middle and half on top. One bowl to wash up, no dry and wet ingredients alternately with milk... definitely worth buying buttermilk for!

I'm not a cinnamon person.  My husband is.  I was making my favorite banana bread and remembered seeing this recipe, so I decided to treat my husband and made a loaf of this too.  Let me just say, there was nothing left that night.  Between him and my 3 children, it was gone while it was still warm.  He was so surprised.  I had a little trouble with the topping, it didn't turn out crumbly, but kind of mushy.  Maybe I'll make sure the butter is colder next time.  Definately an easy recipe with all the ingredients on hand!

If you need something for a special breakfast or brunch, but don't have a lot of time, or cash. Make this cinnamon bread, everybody will love it and you probably have everything on hand.

A moist and delicious quick bread. My only complaint is that the crumb topping fell to the bottom during baking. Next time I will add the topping towards the end of the baking time, which hopefully will prevent this. I also think I will add some chopped apple or raisins next time.

So easy to make and so yummy too! I was surprised that it was more "cakey" than "bready" but I didn't complain when I tasted it! Would be nice with some nuts :)

Some friends & I are gluten-free. 1 of their sons is lactose intolerant. Substituted the 2 cups of flour with 1 cup King Arthur Gluten Free flour and 1-1/4 cups almond flour. Added 2 extra eggs. Used almond milk instead of buttermilk. For the topping, I sprinkled the cinnamon & sugar mix over the batter, drizzled olive oil over that and gently swirled it. It is absolutely amazing!!

The instructions as written will give a dry quick bread. As many others stated, you need to mix the wet and dry ingredients separately, then combine until just mixed. I also think that melted butter would have been better than oil. Finally, this loaf is best when you make it and let it sit for a day. Not a bad recipe, but definitely room for improvement.

One of my pet peeves and joys on this site is a review that loves the recipe then tells all of the alterations made to the original version.  Spoiler:  this does that.  I needed a basic quick bread recipe to which I could add dried apricots and pecans.  This is it! I soaked 1 cup of chopped dried apricots in 1/2 c. Peach Schnapps and 1 c. boiling water for 20 min. Drain,  then with 1/2 c. chopped pecans, add to the dry ingredients.  Make sure the apricots are thoroughly coated in the dry ingredient mix. Omit the cinnamon, and add 1/4 t. nutmeg.  Instead of vanilla, use almond flavoring. Gently fold together the (mixed) wet ingredients and the dry ones.  Bake as directed.  It is a lovely, not overly sweet bread suitable for gifting.

This is absolutely delicious! Very moist. I followed many of the other reviewers' suggestions and doubled the amount for the topping, and then put half of that doubled amount in the middle of the bread and the remaining half on top of it (I swirled them both into the bread batter a bit, with a butter knife, before baking). Everything else I did exactly according to the recipe here. The result was a very moist, dense cinnamon bread with just the right amount of sweetness (not too sweet). Everyone in my family really loved it. This recipe is definitely a keeper and will be made many more times in the future.  Thanks! :)

Love this recipe! I double the cinnamon/sugar/margarine mixture. Then I put half the batter in the pan, top with half the cinnamon/sugar/margarine then repeat. 

This way I get more of a swirl of the cinnamon goo in the middle of the loaf, like a traditional coffee cake. So so good!

I also have done it as muffins and is also really good!

Rather nice change from what I usually make as a breakfast bread. However, I had to make quite a few changes based on what I had on hand already. (Thanks for posting this recipe, anyway!)

Fir example, I had no buttermilk, but lime juice also works, because I wasn’t going to add apple cider vinegar in this and as I had run out of lemon juice. 

We had very little all purpose flour on hand (not enough to make this), so I had to use bread flour. I had to add quick rise yeast, therefore, in addition to the baking powder and baking soda and salt.  (I added about half a tsp of the yeast, stirring it into the dry ingredients.)

I made a serving of 18 to try out the Bundt pan someone suggested here, and it came out lovely!  I also added walnuts I had previously ground up to the strudel part,  because I need to use them up somehow and it seemed perfect for this.

This bread is AMAZING!!  I added some shredded zucchini and chocolate chips. (Its the only way I can get my son to eat veggies, is to hide them!).  I doubled the crumble topping  after taste testing it and it was so good.  Who doesnt like some extra crumble with their bread!  It popped right out of the pan and sliced nicely as well.  This is my new breakfast/dessert bread recipe!!!

This is definitely easy and tastes good, but underwhelming.  It needs something.  My kids have suggested using it for french toast and we have been eating it with ice cream.  Just warmed up with butter slathered on is good with coffee in the morning.

First, I want to thank you for sharing how to make buttermilk from milk & vinegar. I was 60 years old before I found this out. There were many recipes I didn't make because I didn't have buttermilk & didn't want to waste what wasn't used in recipe. This bread is so moist and delicious, I'll make it again very soon.

Followed some suggestions about doubling the topping and using brown sugar!  Used the regular loaf pan plus a small one and that was just right!  Also 5 minutes before done (at 45 minutes baking) I spread melted butter and sprinkled some sugar on top... Delicious!  A keeper!

The cinnamon bread is delicious!  I separated the dry ingredients from the liquid ingredients as someone suggested and combined them together by hand.  I also cut back on the sugar to 1/2cup.  I also doubled the topping putting half in the middle and half on top.  Great suggestion!  I will make this recipe again.

I loved the flavor of this bread.  It was quick and simple to make.  I did follow some other reviewer's suggestions to increase the amount of topping and put some of the topping in the middle of the batter.  However, next time I make it I will melt the butter/sugar/cinnamon topping and drizzle it in rather than putting clumps in the batter.  I'll also line the greased pan with parchment paper.

I made it but I added a cup of golden raisins and only a pinch of salt. I also used a 9”x12” piece of parchment paper to line the loaf pan for very easy removal from the pan to the cooling rack. Everyone liked it especially with a cup of coffee or hot chocolate.

This bread is delicious! I’ve already made it twice, once with almond milk and then with buttermilk. The first time I tripled the cinnamon sugar mixture. I put half in the middle and sprinkled the rest on top. The second time I only doubled it. I will triple it in the future as it was even better- the filling seeped out to the sides and bottom and made a delicious crust!

It turned out tasty even with lemon juice + milk substituting for butter milk. The cinnamon-sugar-butter topping didn’t swirl in well (maybe blending in some flour to help the butter crumble better?) and the texture was a bit coarser than I had hoped, but overall pretty good and I’d both serve it to guests and pass along the recipe.

I used approximately half cup applesauce instead of oil and tripled the streusel and I don’t ever have buttermilk so I squeezed a couple slices of lemon into a cup of almost sour whole milk.  Oh and I used bread flour because I have it.  It is super moist and very yummy, I will make it again but next time I’ll add a crumble for the top because I like a little crunch texture.

The only changes I made were adding chopped walnuts and raisins.  Super moist and yummy slightly warmed with butter. Very easy to make and will make again.

I cut the sugar to half a cup, and added half an overripe mashed banana. Misread the recipe and used more baking soda than listed. Used coconut oil in the topping and milk kefir and water instead of buttermilk. Mixed using a balloon whisk for probably less than 3 minutes as my arms didn't have the stamina.  

It tastes good with  a moist, firm crumb, I will probably make it again as it was easy to put together.

It was ok. Nothing special really. I don't know if it was good enough to go to the trouble of making it again. I like pumpkin bread a lot more than this one.

I made this bread for the first time and it came out great! My boyfriend love it.  I follow the receipt but change a few ingredients  as per several reviews: Instead 3/4 sugar cut it down to 1/2 cups and exchange the oil to unsweetened applesauce.  Double the topping ingredients.  The next time I make it, I should try 1/4 of sugar. I am a diabetic would like to find an alternative for the sugar. Try it, it easy to make.

The instructions for the topping call for butter but margarine is listed in the ingredients.  Also the crumble sank to the bottom of the loaf.  My wife said crumble toppings usually include a small amount of flour.  Was there something left out?  The bread is quite cakey but very tasty.  I'll try it again.

The most important part of this ( taste-wise) is to get proper Ceylon Cinnamon. If you get the Chinese one, you get a very bland loaf.

I made it with buttermilk and made one small change to the sugar topping. I used 2 Tbsp. Brown sugar, 2 teaspoons white sugar, 2 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon and 2 tablespoons melted butter to make a syrup. I poured half of the dough in the pan, then drizzled half the sugary syrup mixture into two long parallel lines across the pan. Using a chopstick I created a marble pattern in the dough by dragging the chop stick parallel through the syrup then again perpendicular across the lines of syrup.. I repeated this on the second half  but only created large swirls perpendicular across the lines of syrup like shown in the photo. This created a lovely effect when baking but also distributed the syrup evenly through the loaf. It was perfect! My husband ate half the loaf! I gave the other half to friends and then had to make another loaf for my husband to take to work!

I followed some suggestions of others and added dry ingredients to wet; used mostly brown sugar; stirred till barely mixed; used a Bundt pan; and tripled the  sugar/cinnamon amounts for marbling in. That’s where I misread the recipe and used 6 tbsp of butter instead of 6 tsp.  I saw that I blew it right away but proceeded anyway. All that butter made the marbling effect disappear but it still tastes good and is nicely moist and textured. Disaster averted.  I will make it again and follow the recipe better.  Good recipe.

This is exactly the same recipe for cinnamon muffins I've been making for 60, yep 60, years.  But doesn't come close to being a recipe for "cinnamon bread", it's a nice recipe though. Raisins or chocolate chips work well, white chocolate is really special...

Reminds me of Amish Friendship Bread - without the wait for the starter. :)  I did sprinkle the tops with a little cinnamon sugar to give it a bit of a crunch - and added chopped California walnuts to one of the loaves - the Tall Guy was over the moon - yes!!!

I don’t eat sugar so used LAKANTO MONKFRUIT SWEETNER which does not leave a horrible taste in your mouth.  It’s a real food.  I used coconut oil because I only use it or olive oil to bake,  then cut up about 8 fresh dates  and mixed through dry ingredients . Everyone liked it.

I've made this recipe at least a dozen times and never make any changes to it (except for substituting butter for margarine). It makes the house smell wonderful and it tastes terrific!  Love it just as it is!

This may be my newest “go-to” cinnamon recipe. It was excellent! I added a hint more cinnamon to both the batter and the swirl (I admit to being a cinnamon addict. LOL).

Similar to other reviewers, I mixed the dry and wet ingredients separately and then mixed them together until combined, not over-mixing. I only added sugar with the liquids. I also doubled the topping and added some in the middle like others suggested. I had to bake for about 55min for it to fully bake. It is tasty but not amazing , feels like it's missing something. The topping definitely helps enhance the flavour, next time I will try adding more layers of the topping

I had buttermilk to use up so I decided to try this recipe.  Added wet ingredients to dry and folded just until mixed. Doubled the strusel and added half to the middle of the bread. Cooked it in two 3x5 pans...sprayed with Pam (There are only two of us. I froze one loaf). It took nearly the full 50 minutes to cook even though the pans were smaller. Very nice tasting and light. Thanks for your recipe. This will stay in my personal collection.

Good. Took others advise & used brown sugar & doubled the cinnamon in the topping. Hubby decided he'd like to double the topping, which would make the cinnamon 4 times as much = 1T & 1 tsp cinnamon. He didn't think he could taste the cinnamon mixture hardly. Will do that for the next one.

I made this for Thanksgiving breakfast, and we just adored it! I prepared it in a bundt pan, and doubled the crumbles. I poured half the batter in, sprinkled half the crumbles in (and swirled around with a toothpick), poured the rest of the batter, and sprinkled the rest of the crumbles. Baked it for about 30 minutes, and let it cool completely in the pan before taking out, and inverting it again, so the delicious crumbles would stay on top. We couldn't stop eating it! This is now a must-have for the "eating meals"- yummm!!!!

The cinnamon flavoring is really nice.  I followed the advice of other reviewers who added  some of the topping to the middle and mixed the wet and dry ingredients separately.  I thought it was slightly crumbly and next time I make it I will add a little more oil or shortening.

I added more cinnamon to the bread itself.  I also mixed dry and wet ingredients separately and then combined using a whisk.  I doubled up the topping and put half in the middle of the loaf and the rest on top.  It made a nice struesel-like topping.  I baked mine for 55 minutes and it was perfect.

I followed the previous reviewer’s suggestions and combined ingredients in the traditional way- combining all dry ingredients then adding the wet ones. As with other quick breads I mixed only until combined. It was late and I didn’t make the strudel like topping. I sprinkled the unbaked loaf with more cinnamon and some coarse sugar. Quick and tasty, although a bit bland. It kept my teenagers busy for a short time ;) Thanks for the recipe

Turned out okay, but was still doughy in the middle after 50 minutes. Ended up baking another 30 minutes, which set the middle but then the exterior was pretty dark.

I used the ingredients as written., however, I put them together the way I was taught as a child. The good old Betty Crocker way. Turned out beautifully and was delicious. Check out snowayngel's review.  That is the way to make succesful quick bread.

I used a bundt pan for this, I doubled the topping as other cooks tried, placing half of the topping in the middle.  I then swirled it  into the batter, my notes say I over swirled.   I over baked by alot , 60 min. is too much.    This was really a cake.   Flavor was just ok, needs Ice Cream.

I was expecting a cinnamon coffee cake-type of bread--it wasn't that.  It had the texture of a regular farmers-style bread loaf; not what I was expecting or wanting.  I followed the recipe, but when the loaf was done, the topping stayed on top, and did not incorporate ("swirl") well into the loaf.  Definitely recommend layering the cinnamon mixture into the loaf and folding it into the top for more flavor.  Nothing special about this bread...Won't be making this again.

I've made this recipe dozens of times. I fold in 1 cup of raisins to this recipe and it makes an excellent cinnamon raisin bread. I have substituted  Splenda for the sugar in this recipe and it came out fine.  I've also made Cinnamon Raisin Bread I which yields 3 loaves of bread but requires at least 90 minutes so the dough can rise correctly. This recipe does not need any time for the dough to rise and makes an excellent cinnamon raisin bread.

This was moist and delicious, but more bread-like, whereas banana bread and zucchini breads are more cake-like. This cinnamon bread may be something you'd want to have with butter or for breakfast, whereas you could have banana bread with ice cream for dessert.  Hope this helps you to plan out your meal and know what to expect!  Worth trying this recipe!

This was delicious!  The only change I made was to use brown sugar instead of white sugar for the swirl filling.  I will definitely be making this again very soon!  Thanks for the great recipe.

The recipe is simple and delicious! I made a few changes like most of the people on here. I used lemon juice and milk instead of buttermilk because I never use enough in a bottle before it expires. I also spread some topping around in the pan for more flavor, but instead of white sugar I used brown. I also added a little bit of Hazelnut coffee creamer to the recipe and it made a subtle boost in flavor. All in all, delicious! Next time I'll be adding diced apples or walnuts as well!

An easy recipe that is tasty.  I would suggest people cover the bread up with foil as my bread turned out quite dark.  I would make it again.

I made it with organic bread flour from King Arthur.  Great texture and the bread looked like it might have come from the bakery!
This recipe is now a staple.

Other Viewers - Grease pan! Definitely mix dry FIRST then liquids in separate bowl. Hand mix only until ingredients are mixed!!!!!! For topping: I double it replacing white sugar with brown sugar. Put half of it in the middle, swirled that w/fork. Put the rest on top. GREAT STUFF esp. when you run into one of the swirls. Next time I will DEFINITELY triple the topping (half in middle, rest on top).  No buttermilk & instead used 1T of lemon juice & filled the rest of the cup with milk

I made this for my husband who has sugar restrictions so I used Splenda brown blended n double of what they call for n double or more of cinnamon.   And yes I used applesauce instead of butter n it turned out delish...  
Omg it is the best recipe.
Thank you for this great recipe... n I had to cook it a lil  longer also.

I didn't have buttermilk on hand so I used whole milk and white vinegar suggested substitute. It was delicious! Next time I'll probably add a little more of the cinnamon-sugar butter swirl.

Well I never got the chance to make the topping. My family swooped into the kitchen at the first sniff of the cinnamon. Needless to say it was devoured. However I did as others suggested and increased the drop/topping mixture, adding in layers with the batter. I absolutely will make this several times more as my son comes home from work looking for it.

I made it and as I love cinnamon used the ingredients as listed.  It was perfect and I took some to a friend who loved it as well.
I will be definitely making more and as Easter is coming up I am going to have a try at turning this recipe into hot cross buns style.  Wish me luck

I mixed dry ingredients separately, mixed wet ingredients, then mixed together briefly since this is a quick bread. It was delicious, moist, just as I'd hoped. Held together well in the toaster too but was great by itself without butter.

The only complaint was: it was not easy to swirl the cinnamon topping. It seemed to end up on the bottom of the loaf. 
That is the only reason it got 4 stars instead of 5.

Yes  I will make it again but I will work on that "swirl" of cinnamon and sugar at the end--mine got lost in the batter.  It was also more "crusty" than I expected so I might adjust the baking temperature--I used a glass loaf pan and 325 might have been a better heat.

Wow!!  Easy and delicious.  Followed others suggestions on using two bowls one for dry ingrediants and one for wet then gently mixing together.  Also did not have buttermilk and added the lemon juice to 1%milk.  I love cinnamon so doubled the topping.  I also put tinfoil under the pan in oven incase it spilled over but it didn't. I highly recommend this recipe.  Whole family loved it.  Next time will make two since this one was gobbled up too fast. Can you tell I am a happy camper!

This bread has a subtle taste. It's not overly sweet but has plenty of cinnamon flavor and the bread has a nice crumb. I baked two loaves. One went into the freezer and the other is almost gone. I'll  be taking the other out of the freezer tomorrow! Will certainly make this again. 
The only problem I had was that the  cinnamon and butter mix (to spread in the batter) clumped up and was hard to spread around. Maybe I let the butter get too warm. I'll try keeping it cooler next time.

I thought this came out great. I mixed just until all ingredients were incorporated. I doubled the sugar , cinnamon mixture and added pecans. Poured 1/2 the batter in added the cinnamon mixture on top then added the rest of the batter. Moist & delicious.

This bread is yummy. The only changes I made was substituted regular white flour for Namaste Foods gluten free flour blend.  As one reader suggested I used brown sugar for the streusel instead of white sugar and tripled the amount placing half in the middle.  The bread came out moist with a lot of flavor. I will definitely keep this recipe for cinnamon bread.

The only change I made to this recipe was doubling the cinnamon mixture and putting half in the middle of the bread while pouring the batter into the pan. 
My husband loved this bread but he is a diabetic so he asked me to wait a week before making it again. I think if he could he'd have me make a fresh loaf every couple of days. 
This was a wonderful recipe and I highly recommend using it to make French toast. We did and loved it!

I  added chopped pecans and currents.  I sprinkled the top with Sparkling White Sugar and a little bit more cinnamon.
I added about 10  minutes to the baking time. It was light and very tasty.

I followed the recipe exactly. Read reviews while it was in the oven, doh! First, it does rise a LOT in the pan so make sure you have room between the pan and next oven rack! It took a LOT longer to cook. At 50 mins it was completely raw still. I ended up adding 13 more minutes by the time it was done. The flavor was wonderful!! Not too cinnamony but you could definitely taste it.  My boyfriend LOVES it! But like other comments, I would double or triple the topping to get more of it marbled in the bread. Definitely will make this again! Yummy!!!

I like the way it  came out.  But I think I will try it again.  To me I think I put too much baking soda, and  the bread taste more of the baking soda.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Great recipe!  I took others suggestions and mixed the dry and wet ingredients separately.  I also doubled the topping and put half of if in the middle of the batter and the other half on top.  It was a huge hit!

Love this recipe!  I doubled the cinnamon mixture as suggested by others, and put half the mixture in the middle.  I guess I didn't swirl it well enough because I had a "tunnel" of it in the middle of the cake instead of throughout.  But it was still wonderful.

I made this recipe exactly as given with exception of using vinegar and milk instead of actual buttermilk. 
It turned out perfectly. It was done in exactly 50 min.,  was risen well above top of pan with nice crunchy crust , sliced well,  and it tasted great.  What more could you ask for?

Really good recipe! I followed the recipe exactly and it came out light and soft. The topping gave a slight crunch to the top crust, which was very nice, and I will definitely make this again. I will also double the topping! The next day it was great lightly toasted with butter on it. Almost like a cinnamon bun. Thanks!

Very nice!  Don't cut in the butter/sugar crumble too deeply, though--the bread stuck to the bottom of my pan after baking and perhaps the sugary crumble was the culprit.

I love anything cinnamon and I have a wonderful bundtcake recipe similar to this but more cake.  It has walnuts and mini chocolate chips and I also love walnuts so for this cinnamon bread I added chopped walnuts to the cinnamon sugar.  Use as much as you like. Delicious!

I don't know...honestly I didn't like this too much. It tasted too much like banana bread (sans the actual bananas). It was OK. Just right on the sweetening, the texture, the amount of cinnamon, etc. I love cinnamon, but I didn't really like this bread. The flavor is just really lacking. We'll eat it, but I definitely won't make again. Also, the swirl did nothing. It just sunk all to the bottom of the pan making for a very buttery bottom. My bread was done in 30 minutes , but I split the batter into two smaller loaves. I guess if you like banana bread, you'll like this. Not that it tastes like bananas- just reminds me too much of it.

This is an easy, quick, delicious recipe.  I made 16 muffins filling each with 1/4 cup batter and cooked 19 mins. at 350.  I doubled topping ingredients.  I used applesauce in place of 1/2 of the oil and 1 Tbls. cinnamon.  I LOVE cinnamon.  They are delicious and not too sweet.  I may triple the topping next time.  I didn't make a loaf because I always have trouble getting things to cook through in a loaf pan.

Although this bread turned out ok, i wish the directions were a little easier to follow. I noticed as I was going along the directions and ingredients said to totally different things. Overall, the bread is very moist and perfect for a breakfast treat.

This recipe turned out well with some finessing at the end, but I have some suggestions.  If you live in a higher altitude like I do (Colorado), you may need to increase the baking time.  Also I would suggest dividing the batter between 2 smaller loaf pans.  I used just one regular loaf pan, and it rose very high, making it hard to test the doneness of the bottom of the loaf without taking the entire thing out of the pan and visually checking the bottom (toothpick doesn't reach far enough to check the bottom center of the bread in a regular loaf pan).  My bottom center  was still doughy after baking for 50 minutes and I had to put it back in the oven for another 7 minutes.  The bread itself was delicious and the crust was nice and crisp.  The next time I make this I'm going to put the butter/sugar/cinnamon topping just on the top without cutting it into the batter so it has a nice crunchy cinnamon crust on top.

This is a lovely quick bread that is easy to make, but you need to pay attention to the recipe, because the 1 cup of sugar you add with the flour isn't listed in the ingredients!

I  have made this twice, first with the milk/vinegar substitution and buttermilk the second time. Both ways were quite good, but using buttermilk made it just a bit better taste and texture wise.  Combine the dry ingredients together in a bowl and the wet separately in another bowl. I simply mixed the two together until combined, no need to beat for 3 minutes!

This bread is not overly sweet and not over spiced with cinnamon, and is quite nice with coffee or tea! I will be making this regularly.

I added 1/4 cup brown sugar to batter. I added 2 tbsp brown sugar and 2 tsp butter to topping.  I put 1/2 batter in pan, sprinkled 1/2 topping, added remaining  batter, then remaining topping. Swirled.  
My grandchildren loved it and they hate everything.

I don't like rating when I don't follow the recipe exactly but I thought it was excellent with the changes I made based on other reviews. I added a powder sugar glaze over the top and it was wonderful. I will definitely make this again.

I read the reviews for this recipe before making (as I usually do) and followed recommended steps by reviewers to combine the dry and wet ingredients separately. I also used one tablespoon of brown sugar and one tablespoon of white sugar as a substitute for the 2 tablespoons of white sugar that is used in the topping. As I didn't have a bread/loaf baking tin, I used a baking tray of 6 individual little rectangles and it worked perfectly. I might add slightly more cinnamon next time, as the flavour was a bit too subtle for me (or maybe I just love cinnamon too much?). Great recipe, will definitely make again.

I added some icing glaze drizzled over the top, just look up simple icing glaze, really sets it off! Moist cake, great with tea and coffee.   I also used skim milk and it still was moist and delicious!

Just ok. Followed recipe and didn't double topping like others to put in middle. Wasn't terribly flawed or anything. But just ok. Family didn't finish loaf and ended up tossing it after several days.

Turned out better than good but not great will definitely make again with some modifications.  A little mild in flavour - but will at least double if not triple the topping mixture.  Also took a lot longer to cook than the recommended 50 mins.  Since lactose is not our friend I did the substitute with Lactose free milk and vinegar. Don't know why but it grew insanely high - basically a mutant bread!

I was sooooo disappointed. I have never thrown out a cake, but I did with this. The cake/bread was gross. ..I have been cooking for 65+ years and this was not what I would call a good recipe.

Made the recipe as is. It worked out just fine although I was a little surprised at how liquidy the mix was, but it rose nicely.  
Easy recipe to do when in a pinch for something, both my boys liked it, but it didn't rate much for hubby & myself, I thought it was really bland. Next time, I will definitely make more crumble topping,

I doubled the topping after reading reviews.  I might try using applesauce instead of oil which should add a little flavor.  Maybe some walnuts in the topping as well.  It just seems to be missing something, but the kitchen smells wonderful!

I followed the advice in the reviews, I tripled the topping putting 1/3 in the middle and the other 2/3 on the top.  It was super and very moist!  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, as I do in all my recipes...much healthier!

I made this bread last night and it is good. I had to bake it for 60 minutes because 50 was not long enough. I also mixed the dry and wet ingredients, separate and spoon mixed them together. I will make this again, for sure. Thanks for the tips from the other reviewers. That really helped.

I made it, we loved it.  I did not have buttermilk so used a tablespoon of lemon juice in a cup of whole milk.  Also added half a cup of raisins to the batter, this is a great breakfast bread to accompany morning coffee.

Great Recipe! Quick and easy. I substituted brown sugar for regular sugar for the topping and doubled both the amount of sugar and butter. I added half of the batter to the pan and then poured half of the brown sugar & butter mixture over the batter, and then added rest of batter then rest of mixture to top of batter. I also took the advice from a reviewer and combined dry and wet ingredients separately and then combined them. I also plan to bake for 40 minutes instead of 50.
Very tasty recipe, you'll love it.

This was an enjoyable treat that came out nicely dense and moist. I initially feared the recipe called for too much cinnamon but it turned out to be just the right amount. I added half a cup each of pecans and walnuts. Everyone really enjoyed it.

Great recipe. Bread was moist and the cinnamon gave it a good balance. I added walnuts into the topping and it really gave it a kick. I agree with others who said to double the topping. The next time I am going to triple the topping and pour half the batter into the loaf pan, and then spread a thin layer in the middle of the cake. Next pour the remaining batter into the pan and then top it with the remaining cinnamon-walnut topping.

The flavor was good even though the texture was a little dry.  It makes a difference if you spread with a little butter.  I would make it again.

The bread was just ok.  I did double the streusel -like topping as recommended by other reviewers and put half in the middle.  It just did not have enough cinnamon flavor for me and the bread texture slightly awkward.   If I make it again I would drizzle something over the top, powdered sugar or some other topping.  I think it would be good with pecans in the mix or as a topping as well.

Turned out not bad. I used milk/vinegar and I mixed the dry and wet ingredient separately before blending them together. One thing to watch out for is getting the 'swirl' to the edge of the bread pan. If it is touching the metal it will burn before the bread is cooked. Not a huge deal one way or the other.

Decided to make this slightly more diet friendly so I used half almond flour, half CarbQuick, Splenda as the sugar and for the topping I used both Splenda and Sukrin Gold.  I should have replaced the buttermilk but had it on hand so I used it.  I also went with another reviewer's tip and mixed the wet to the dry slowly NOT beating the mixture and increased the topping then put it in the middle and on top.   I also increased the cinnamon for the batter and topping by a lot (did not measure).  Both husband and I loved this.  Bread was slightly cake like, moist and very tasty.

I used apple sauce instead of the 1/4 cup vegetable oil, and used mini muffins.  Otherwise I followed the recipe, and it came out very moist.    Hubby and I both liked it a lot.  Thinking of using the bread for Christmas gifts.

I followed the recipe exactly as it was written and although the flavor was good, it turned out a bit dry.  I might have left it in the oven too long.  Next time I'll add raisins.

Delicious! The only change I made was I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar. I also made extra butter/ sugar crumble and added to the top and inside. Made it more moist. Will definitely make again.

Mix wet in one bowl, and dry in another, then slowly mix wet into dry.
Double the topping, putting half into the middle of the loaf. And for the topping sugar, use half brown sugar.
I cooked exactly 50 minutes.

Super moist and delicious. But I added another 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup brown sugar. Also mixed in chocolate chips, but they sank to the bottom and I am not sure why, but was super super yummy! I used lemon with the milk to make a buttermilk substitute.

It was ok, it seemed too heavy.  I doubled the toping and the butter was a little hard so maybe that had something to do with it.  I probably won't make it again.  I'm still on the hunt for the perfect cinnamon bread.

FANTASTIC QUICK EASY. So good. Simple ingredients, sugar cinnamon gives it such a punch. Very moist, perfect for anytime . I doubled and used 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 all purpose flour, only because I wanted to double recipe and only had 2 cups of flour. Still very good. Enough for 3 loaves in smaller pans. I definitely more than doubled the cinnamon sugar topping and used butter. I took the idea of putting in center of loaf as well as top.
I can't improve on this. Iloveit

This sounded like such a plain recipe, but I made it because I had nothing else for breakfast. Wow! For having no special ingredients, this loaf was delicious! Dark, moist and perfect. Definitely a keeper.

This recipe was very easy to make.  I made it exactly according to the recipe, everything right in the bowl and mixed for 3 minutes.  It came out great, rose quite well.  My husband absolutely loves it.  I felt it could use just a little bit more flavor, I think the next piece I try I'll put some butter and cinnamon and sugar on it.  It was soft and the crust was the perfect amount of "crunchy".  I didn't get a marbled effect on top as the recipe suggested by swirling the topping, but that didn't really matter to me as it wasn't for show, it was just for my husband and I to eat.  
Overall, my husband and I really enjoyed it and it was so easy to make, that I would gladly make this recipe again.  Aside from the buttermilk, I had all the ingredients already on hand.

I always double this recipe and make a glaze (powdered sugar, milk, vanilla) that I add---it creates a lovely.  It never lasts more than a couple of days in my house and even my pickiest eaters love it! I think the trick is not to over beat this recipe---3 minutes max.  It has come out perfect every time and ends at 50 minutes on the dot.

Recipe easy to follow and understand. Bread turned out just fine. In this order:  I cooled it, sliced it, then iced it,  and put back in loaf pans to freeze. Then took the bread out and placed in a gallon sized baggie so that my family could take out a slice at a time.

This was so disappointing! I ended up with a very dense, bland, dry, crumbly bread... It smelled great so I was excited to try it, but as soon as it fully cooled it became clear how dry and bland it really was... No one liked it.

This recipe is a keeper! The second time I made it, I put 2-3 times the streussel. I put some on the top and some on the bottom. So good. One thing I did notice is that it definitely tastes better the next day. So yummy!!!!

Made "as-is" and was just like a quick bread should be!  Then I made 5 loaves for Christmas Gifts but added 1/2 tsp. more cinnamon to the mix - because it's Christmas! - and had nothing but great reviews.  This will be made again and again along with my High Altitude Banana Quick Bread.          OH, the Possibilities.

It was good but I substituted the milk and vinegar for the buttermilk and it wasn't as moist as I would have liked it to be. Also the recipe filled the loaf pan size that was recommended in the recipe so I should have poured some of the batter into a smaller loaf pan and then it would have possibly cooked better.

I did make it!  New recipes always make me a lil nervous.  this one turned out great.  Although I had to bake it for 75 minutes.  For next time, I will add more cinnamon and maybe substitute some brown sugar for some of the white sugar.

I followed the recipe and cooking instructions exactly and was disappointed that I didn't read the reviews first.  I think if you make this according to what others wrote  then it would be five stars. The key is to not blend the batter for three minutes because it becomes very runny and adding extra strudel is a good recommendation awesome.

Absolutely wonderful recipe!!!  I have made this exactly like the recipe is written and it comes out perfectly every time.  I test it after 50 minutes and occasionally I have to let it bake another 3-5 minutes.  My family and friends are always asking me for a Cinnamon Bread.

Tried twice and same results. Middle of bread sank in the oven and it stuck to a well oiled new bread pan. What am I doing wrong? Still tasted good though. I gave the stars for the flavor regardless of my crappy cooking skills. I've made other breads with no problem.

I loved this recipe :D the bread came out moist and fragrant and extremely delicious 
I followed the advice of other users by mixing the dry ingredients alone and the wet alone, I added a dash of nutmeg and cloves just because I love them and I increased the topping a bit 
Definitely will be making this again !

This recipe was great. I wasn't expecting much because it was my first time making it, but it was really good! I had some milk that was fixing to go bad, so I made it into buttermilk and used it all, ending up with a doubled recipe. I made it last night and all but one slice (out of two full-sized loaves) was gone by this morning! Success! It was a little difficult for me to crumble the topping, since I used butter instead of margarine, but I was doing it with my fingers, so the butter was melting instead of crumbling. By the end of it, I was using a fork, and I let it sit in the fridge a little before I put it in the second loaf, but it still didn't look very crumbly. Turns out it doesn't matter, because it all sunk down the middle to make a glorious crumbly cinnamon streak! (:

This is a very quick and simple sweet bread.  Served it up with butter for a brunch or as a desert. I subbed 1/2 a cup of the flour for 1/2 quick oats and used plain yogurt instead of butter milk.  Turned out very moist and very good.

I give this 3 stars as written (comes out a bit dry & heavy with a buttermilk aftertaste) but I found that a few changes made it to my liking.  I always double quick bread recipes and put them in a bundt pan and I mix the wet and dry ingredients separately but I mix the sugar with the wet.  So, for this cinnamon bread, I doubled all the ingredients but I only use 3 1/2 cups of flour instead of 4; 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 cups white sugar (both work fine but this last time I used 1 1/2) and 1 cup packed brown sugar; 1 generous tablespoon of ground cinnamon; canola oil (just over 3/4 cup - not quite 1 cup) instead of vegetable oil; 2 cups of unsweetened vanilla almond milk instead of buttermilk (I still used the 4 teaspoons of vanilla extract); eliminated the topping; and added 1 1/2 cups of chopped pecans (a 1/4 cup more wouldn't hurt).  I bake it on 350 for 57 minutes and it's perfect....it truly tastes like a cinnamon roll (I think it's because of the added vanilla from the vanilla almond milk) and it was much more moist (canola oil and less flour!!).  And yes, there is some added sugar but a total of 2 1/4 to 2 1/2 cups of sugar for double a quick bread recipe is not a lot; doubling some recipes on this site have called for 3 to 4 cups which I've certainly had to cut by 1/2 a cup to 1 full cup.

Wasn't sure about this recipe based on other's reviews. I decided to make it as written except I did cream the sugar with the oil, added the eggs and vanilla and then alternated the dry ingredients with the buttermilk. Made the topping as written and thought it was enough for the bread. Had it for bruch today and everyone liked it. Definitely will be making this again.

I did 3x the topping and the swirl in the middle, it came out like a banana bread minus the bananas. It's good enough but not remarkable and feels like it's missing something. It is sweet enough but I don't think I'll make it again.

Fantastic. I made it exactly as in the recipe, but I made a vanilla cream glaze to go on top of it. It tastes -exactly- like a cinnamon roll. A really nice desert.

Delicious.  From other reviewers, I recommend 2 layers alternating 1/2 the batter and 1/2 the topping.  My husband likes topping so I tripled the topping ingredients.  The vinegar + milk combo instead of buttermilk works!!

I've made this for many years - have always done the wet/dry ingredients seperate like the other reviewers mentioned, and don't over-beat the batter. It is a family favorite, and I think it's perfect in moistness, texture, and flavor. Not too sweet; not too dry. (Just don't over-bake it. It's better slightly underdone than overdone. Yes, even if the middle turns out a little gooey - that's OKAY. It's still great and better than having a dry loaf.)  A very favorite breakfast bread of ours.

This came out so much better than I thought it would! It was sweeter than I expected (but I wouldnt ever cut down on the sugar). I used brown sugar for the topping and doubled it like other reviewers, and I also used half whole wheat flour which I think made it VERY nice. It has a fantastic crunchy sweet crust too. Would be great with raisins or applesauce in the mix, or butter or apple butter spread on top too.

I love this bread! i also made a variation when i ran out of cinnamon. Instead of 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon i added 1/2  teaspoon cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon ginger with 1/2 teaspoon cloves. I did the same for the crumble..it gives it a pumpkin cinnamon flavor that is very good!

Delicious!  And sooo easy!  The only changes I made were substituting the vinegar and milk for buttermilk, and using a cake pan instead of a loaf pan.  It came out perfect and my D&D group demolished it in half an hour.

This is a great recipe love it, but the baking time is 50 min, it's way too much for me it was a little dry and I only baked for 43 min. Next time I will start checking after 30-35 min.

I made this will all white wheat flour and increased the buttermilk to 1-1/3 cups.  I used 3/4 cup natural cane sugar and threw in about 1/2 cup of chocolate chips.  I didn't do the cinnamon sugar swirl.

This cinnamon bread is great comfort food! It's enough to put a smile on someone's face and make them ask you for the recipe. I did however double the amount of cinnamon, which I personally reccomend doing. I don't know about the marbled effect  but it smelled  simply delightful. Simple and delish.

This recipe was easy to make and turned out wonderfully.  As soon as we finished it off my husband and kids begged me to make more.  I really enjoyed having a slice with a cup of tea.

This was okay, but nothing special.  It may have been better to double the cinnamon swirl since it was hard to find in most slices.

I followed the recommendations of others and mixed the wet ingredients and then added the dry ingredients. I also doubled the topping (used brown sugar) and put half in the middle. It looked really good going into the oven, but at 50 minutes when I went to check on it, it was already brown on the outside but the inside was still runny. When I moved it a little, it sloshed over and spilled (luckily I had a baking sheet underneath). I kept it in almost 20 minutes more. The end result tasted pretty good but it kept falling apart, so it was a mess. I think this recipe has promise, I just need to work with it more.

I made this recipe exactly as written and I cannot wait to make it again!  That being said, I am planning on doubling the cinnamon/sugar mix and will pour in half the batter, then cinnamon mix, then add remaining batter & cinnamon on top.  Even with the original recipe, I was surprised that the cinnamon mix ended up all through the cake.  I just felt that I want more of it!  I'm even thinking of trying it with a little cocoa mixed in with the cinnamon/sugar.

You need to mix the butter sugar mixture to the bottom as it all stayed on the top.  Also grease the pan really well as it stuck to the bottom.  Boys loved it.  Reminds me of a dry cinnamon bun.

Yup, like the others, I should have read the comments first.  Definitely needed to be sweeter.  Next time, some modifications, but otherwise, a good recipe

This is bread is seriously good. I followed some of the modifications suggested by others, namely: 1. Mixed wet and dry ingrediants together seperately, then  mixed dry into wet, stirring only until combined 2. Doubling the cinnamon butter mixture and layering half in the middle of the loaf. The loaf was perfectly done in the 50 minutes suggested. My only complaint is that it is just this side of too crumbly; I'll have to eat it with a fork if I don't toast it.

This was a big hit. I doubbled the cinnamon, butter and sugar like others had suggested to make more of the swirl. I think next time i would triple it, great bead.

I love quick bread and am an avid baker but I really did not like this recipe.  It had a strange consistency and was not worth eating even with double strusel topping.

I had read the reviews after I put the bread in the oven.  I was dissappointed after reading the reviews because I thought my bread was not going to be good.  After baking the bread, I took a bite and and was happily surprised!  The bread was lightly sweet and moist, not rubbery and dry like the comments.  I followed the recipe except I used fat free milk and a dash of rice vinegar. I decided not to put the strusel on top.  Baked it in a glass loaf pan for about 60 min.  It was wonderful!  I will defiinately use this recipe again.

I am a big fan of cinnamon bread, and let me tell you, this bread is delicious! It is so moist and has just the right amount of sweetness. Like other reviewers, I mixed the dry and liquid ingredients separately, and then combined them just until the dry ingredients were moist. I modified the recipe to make it healthier. I used whole wheat flour, Splenda, applesauce in place of the oil, 1 1/2 tablespoons of lemon juice and 1 cup of milk (I didn't have buttermilk on hand) and I added raisins. The final product was so good. This bread makes a great breakfast bread. I will definitely make it again.

Very quick and easy!  Delicious the next day toasted.  I use only 1/2 C sugar, and add 1/2C of fruit- diced plums, golden raisins, apple chunks are all great- and make it super moist!

When we first tasted this we thought it bland and just okay. I voted 3 stars, my husband voted 2 stars. However this morning I cut into it to give some to the kiddos and found the cinnamon sugar butter crumb mixture actually swirled in through the center in spots where as the end piece we tried did not. I will make this again however I will I will double or maybe triple the crumb topping and alternate layering the batter with the topping to create a marble effect. Raisins would also be a really terrific addition. I notice comments of the texture of the bread so know that it is that of a muffin not traditional "bread".

Absolutely delicious. I doubled the topping as suggested and found it was a bit much.  The regular recipe would probably have been just fine.

This is a good breakfast bread. It's not overly sweet, unless you add some chocolate chips in it like I did. It was very good and filling. I made buttermilk by using 1 tbs white vinegar and 1 c skim milk.

Took others suggestions and tripled topping (changing white sugar to brown sugar), putting 2/3 of it in the middle of the batter. Also combined dry ingredients, beat wet ingredients, and then mixed them just until combined.  Baked in 9x9 glass pan.

This is the first bread i've ever made from scratch and it turned out delicious! I followed the advice of other reviews and doubled the amount of topping, and then put half in the middle.  I will definitely make this again!

This was delicious!  I added chopped walnuts and they REALLY added a boost to the taste and texture.  Also, I didn't have a loaf pan so I made them as muffins (reduce the cooking time if you make it this way).  Will definitely make again and again and again!!!

This is very good, but not something that I would crave or make for a special occasion.  So, I am giving it 4 stars, since I wouldn't necessarily ever make it again.

This was amazing. It tasted like a lower fat version of cinnamon rolls. I didn't have any buttermilk, so I used water and it came out just fine. I made this into muffins for a quick snack/breakfast.

I would rate this as just OK.  Will not be making it again.  My loaf was a bit on the dry side for a dessert bread and the flavor just wasn't there.  I made the recipe as written other than combining dry ingred. and wet seperately then mixing.

I made this recipe yesterday and took the other reviewers suggestions by doubling the streuesel topping.  The bread is delicious and the recipe was wanted by several of my co-workers.  The bread baked in the amount of time suggested and did not overflow.  I will definetly make this bread again.

Im not sure if i did something wrong in this recipe but my bread turned out really dry.  The flavor was pretty good just a tab bit on the bland side for me.  I think it would be a great recipe with a little tweeking.

FABULOUS!!  This bread is wonderful!  I substituted 1/2 c of whole wheat flour for 1/2 of the white flour and applesauce instead of oil.  While pouring the batter, I added the suggested extra topping to the middle of the batter. I will definitely make this again!  My family thought it was wonderful bread.

This is a wonderful quick bread! The only changes I made were to use whole wheat pastry flour, instead of all-purpose, and doubled the topping and added it to the center, as well as on top. It came out great. Every bite included the wonderful buttery/sweet mixture! I baked these in the mini loaf pans.

I doubled the recipe so that I could serve one and freeze one.  I also doubled the topping amount again, so that I could put some in the middle and some over the top.  The cinnamon smell and taste was wonderful.

This is THE BEST. I have been making this recipe for over a year now and it always turns out great, whether I make it as a bread of muffins. I use whole wheat flour and sucanat in place of the all-purpose flour and white sugar and it still tastes awesome. Thanks so much for the recipe!

My hubby said "heavenly".  Guess he liked it.  So did I.  I tripled the topping but thought that was a little much.  Double would have been better. Definitely sweet, but if you're in the mood for sweet, this is great. Easy to make.  Had to cook it about 55 minutes maybe because of all the extra I stuck in the middle. :O)
Thanks to the poster.

I made these into muffins for convience and they came out good, i should've sprayed the papers so they would come out easier, but all in all it was a good idea. My picky 5 yr. old snarffed it up and my hunny ate 3 before they were cool, guess I need to make more!! This is a good "on the go" breakfast, not too crumbly.

Couldn't keep my hands out of it!  I reduced the sugar to 3/4 c. (still very sweet); doubled the topping replacing white with brown sugar; and replaced the oil with applesauce.  Rised beautifully!

Good cake - moist and delicious. I cut the sugar to 3/4 of a cup. Following reviewers' advice I doubled the topping (using half brown sugar, half white) and put half the crumbs in the middle. It took over an hour to bake.

I read several of the reviews before baking this loaf and took the advice given.

I altered the recipe slightly to be 3/4 c white sugar and 1/4 c brown sugar. This worked out really well!

I also doubled the cinnamon sugar crumble, layering dough>crumble>dough>crumble


YUMMY!

a little bit too sweet, i'll have to cut back on the sugar next time but i doubled the topping recipe and used a knife to create the marbled cinnamon texture. finding an icing recipe to top it off would make this perfect.

I followed the recipe except for  doubling the topping and putting half of it in the middle of the bread. My husband liked it...I thought it was okay.

I followed the other reviewer's suggestions but the topping needs to be tripled. It's an ok recipe (I gave it four stars anyway), but I doubt I'll make it again without trying other recipes first.

Super moist bread with great flavor. It was much better right out of the oven rather than the next day at room temp.  I doubled the topping and mixed it through the bread.

Very good! I did cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup, however next time I will cut it down to 1/2 cup. I tripled the crumb putting half in the middle and the rest on top. The top was very crunch which everyone loved, however it overflowed in the over making it difficult to remove from the pan. Next time I will put it in two smaller pans or one larger. I also mixed the ingredients as specified in the other reviews. Note: used butter & olive oil to get rid of the trans fats! Sucanat or Rapadura also works good in this recipe in place of the white refined sugar.

This bread was excellent. I did take the advice of other reviewers and mixed wet and dry ingredients separately. I also tripled the topping ingredients but didn't use it all. Overall, very tasty and just the right amount of sweetness and cinnamon flavor.

Good! After reading all the reviews- I tripled the topping- put 2/3 inside and 1/3 on top. Then I drizzled some icing on top- yum!

the bread itself turned out beautiful.the taste leaves a little to be desired. i followed all recommendations, mixing dry and wet ingredients separately, didnt beat for 3 minutes, used a bigger bread pan, and doubled the topping. i couldnt really even taste the topping in the bread (i put half in the middle) and barely any on top.  was quick and easy to make and tastes ok. i also added raisins.

Double the topping like the other reviews have said, and I also substituted some applesauce for oil to make it more moist.  A great bread for breakfast or an afternoon snack!

This did not turn out with as much flavor as I had hoped for. It took alot longer for it to bake also. I will try this again and maybe add more cinnamon as well as maybe some nutmeg or cloves.

maybe I did something wrong, but I wasn't too impressed.  It turned out fine, but it was rather chewey and the ends seemed much tougher than the middle.  I made this exactly as the recipe stated (I don't trust myself to deviate)

I wasn't crazy about this.  It was just ok in my book.  I did double the crumble stuff and that is the only part that was great about the loaf.  I baked it in a bundt pan and my family did eat it all so it wasn't terrible so gave it 3stars!

This turned out ok.  I think I baked it too long, as the crust turned out really dry. The inside was really good tho, and with a little butter it was great.

This was absolutely fantastic! I took the advice of other reviewers and 3x the cinnamon swirl mix using brown sugar, because I absolutely love cinnamon! I also added a little over a cup of chopped apple, which I believe made this even more moist. I wouldn't exactly call this bread... It felt more like cake. This felt a little bit greasy, but I loved it, and it looks and smells fantastic!

Soooo simple and yet so good. Not too sweet but very moist, the cinnamon-y crust was my favourite part. It took just over an hour for mine to bake. Thanks for the recipe!

Really nice bread for morning coffee.  Didn't have any buttermilk but I did have sour cream, so used half sour cream and half milk with lemon.  Also threw in a handful each of raisins & chopped pecans.

I did take other peoples advice by mixing the dry and liquid ingredients separate, and tripling the topping is a must for this one. Very good recipe! I gave it to friends of mine for a gift and my boyfriend begs me to make more of it.

This bread was pretty good! My only problem was that it took sixty-four minutes instead of the stated fifty. It tasted great, though, and it was well worth the wait. Thanks.

Very good recipe.  Quick, easy, and tasty to beat.  The exact same recipe is on the Old Farmers Almanac web site under Aunt Bee's Cinnamon Bread.  The only difference being to use white vanilla instead of dark.

This bread is excellent, definately a crowd pleaser.  I followed the recipe except that I doubled the topping and used brown sugar instead of white.  Also, I added extra cinnamon.  Very good and so EASY!

I made this for houseguests and everyone loved it! It's really tasty and almost addictive, and is even better with a light layer of butter on each slice. I could not get the marbling effect but it was a small detail. Also it took over an hour to cook, but I had my convection oven at 170C since is only goes up 10 degrees at a time. I can't wait to make it again!

This was great. Reminded me alot like coffee cake. My 9 year did most the work. Switched the white sugar for brown for the topping and doubled it,putting 1/2 in the middle and 1/2 on top. Tasted best warm.

I am going to try this one again.  I did sub the oil with applesauce, so I will follow perfectly next time and swirling the cinnamon/sugar just didn't seem to work.  The loaf came out very dense, but the flavor was good.  My family ate it but no one said that it was amazing, as they normally would.

I'm a bit mixed on this.  I made it as is (real buttermilk and all), except I mixed the dry ingredients together first cause that just seemed logical, and I substituted applesauce for the oil, something I do often for breads.  The problem I had was that the topping that got swirled in just stayed gooky and never really cooked right -- as a couple of others have said, mine wasn't crumbly but more pasty.  I know I baked this over an hour and had to just remove it before the outsides got too done.  I knocked the score up one higher than what I thought, because it may just be I got too much topping swirled into the center, or I'd even believe it was my oven with the problem, so I gave it the benefit of the doubt.

Great bread. I mixed the dry and wet ingredients before combining them as suggested by other reviewers also used milk and vinegar in place of buttermilk. I did have a bit of trouble with the topping mine wasn't crumbly more of a paste and when I started swirling it sank into the batter. That didn't prove to be a problem as it meant when I cut the bread it was marbled inside very faintly but it was there. Daughter can't wait for me to make this again. Thanks.

This was easy and very moist.  I did however double the cinnamon and doubled the sugar topping and added some brown sugar into the topping.  I split the loaf and swirled half of it in the middle and then swirled the other part on top of the loaf.  It gave it a nice flavor.  This is a great alternative to coffee cake.  Will definitly make again.

I followed other reviews and mixed dry/wet ingred. separately, doubled the topping, putting 1/2 of it in the middle of the bread, and I love vanilla so I added a bit extra.  I didn't have buttermilk and the only kind of yogurt I had was apple so I tried it and it came out great!  I wish we hadn't eaten so much last night because it tasted better this morning and there isn't much left.  This ones a keeper.

I didn't have enough time to throw together cinnamon rolls this Thanksgiving morning, so I made this instead....absolutely wonderful! I used the vanilla yogurt/milk combination since I didn't have any buttermilk, and it worked great. I also doubled the crumb mixture. Great, easy recipe.

Wonderful!!  Don't change a thing in the recipe either.  It was perfect!  I had never heard of cinnamon *bread* before, but had some leftover buttermilk, so I decided to try it.  Loved it, and it was so easy to make!  Will be making this again and again.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

There is nothing special about this recipe.  I found that it had very little flavor, dispite doulbling the cinnamon.  I mixed the recipe as suggest by a previous reviewer, dry ingredients then added the wet (this prevents gluten from forming and toughening the batter/dough).  The bread had a delicate muffin texture that was slightly cakey.  This recipe would require too many additions and tweakings for me to be making again.  It is a good base recipe for those who like to tinker with recipes.

This bread baked up nicely and was yummy spread with butter when it was hot and fresh out of the oven.  The flavor of the bread didn't really wow me though.  I may add a little more cinnamon next time.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was great.  My kids loved it very much.  I had to change a few things.  I didn't have enough sugar on hand, so I did half white sugar and half brown sugar.  I also added 2 teaspoons of cocoa powder.  It was wonderful.

Easy to make, and delicious! Regular milk was OK to use instead of buttermilk, but the best substitution was Dannon coffee yogurt - it added great flavor and gave a moist texture.

Do mix dry and wet ingredients separately and stir just until combined. Only change I'll make will be to tent with foil for the last few minutes. As others said this is more like cake than a true bread. My family didn't care-they loved it!

If you follow this recipe as written, you can't go wrong.  Mmmmm...don't be discouraged by the naysayers.  Perhaps there was a problem with their ovens or preparation.  Very good.  Thanks.

I originally rated this one 3 stars and had to come back and update it to 4 stars.  From my original rating, 1 problem was that there was too much batter for the size bread pan specified and the loaf rose a little high.  I suggest making the mix into muffins or using a larger bread pan.  I also wrote that the finished product was bland, better I should have let it cool overnight in the fridge rather than slice it straight out of the oven.  It was much better the next day with a bit of cream cheese smeared on it.

If it was up to presentation I would give it only 3 stars but the flavor was a knockout!! My daughter and I had it warm with butter on top..yummmm. She's the critic for cinnamon bread so I went with her review for 5 Stars! NOTE: I also used the advice from another reviewer and mixed the dry and wet ingredients seperatly before combining. Thanks for the recipe..a keeper!!

This was so easy to make!  The only problem that I had was the topping didn't crumble.  So I dropped chuncks in and then swirled with a knife.  Because it was more of a spread I used it on top when it was fully cooked. Oh, and I added icing!

Very delicious with coffee in the morning. I made this recipe into muffins and had very good results. It makes a ton... almost two dozen! I froze them and then i simply pull out the amount I want and they are defrosted within a few minutes. The crumb topping makes and should be doubled for even more cinnamon flavor!

The bread was easy enough to make. I can’t say it’s my favorite; however, I might make again and triple the topping mixture.

This was nice. I used whole wheat flour, and half white/half brown sugar. I didn't have any veg. oil, so I used olive oil. It was a dense bread (I like it like that). I sliced it up, and put half in the freezer.

I'm not really thrilled with this recipe.  It came out somewhere between a cake and a heavy loaf of bread.  It was an odd one.  The flavors are very nice but the texture was strange.

This tasted a lot like coffee cake but not as sweet. I had to bake for an extra 15 minutes because it wasn't cooked in the middle after 50 minutes. The swirl through the bread didn't work out at all, instead I had a bit of topping that seemed to sink down the middle. Also the top/middle of the bread rose very high but the edges didn't and it looked a little strange. It crumbled a bit when I cut the slices both when it was warm and when it had cooled. I wouldn't make this for company because the appearance wasn't so great but it tasted good.

I can't say enough good things about this recipe.  It's the best cinnamon bread I've ever eaten.  I took the advice from other reviews and mixed the dry and wet ingredients separately and also added an extra 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of allspice.  I used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar instead off all white.  I added some raisins, but they ended up on the bottom of the pan, which was okay b/c then they're easy to remove by people who don't care for them.  Thanks for the great and easy recipe!

Loved it!! Very easy to make and full of wonderful flavor!!  Makes the house smell wonderful!!  WHEN I make this again, I am going to fill pan half way do the butter/sugar thing and then put remaining batter on top and not attempt to "marble".  I will be doing this one again!

Better than I expected! They were a big hit with my kids and friends! I made a loaf and some muffins too! I added brown sugar and more than doubled the topping mixture. I also spread some of the sugar mixture in the middle of the batter which made it yummy! I will make this again.

I followed the recipe exactly, baked it at the correct temp, and used the correct size pan.  However, the batter overflowed and made a mess in my oven.

Well, it certainly is a bread.  It was a bit dry to my taste, not so sweet and I think it could have been more flavourful.  Nice swirl and nice rounded rise in the oven, though!

I followed some of the suggestions of the other bakers and I mixed the wet and dry seperatly and then mixed them together.  I added extra cinnamon to the batter (I love cinnamon) and for the topping, I added extra cinnamon, I used half brown sugar, half white and I added honey because the topping was too crumbly and it wouldn't "marble" into the batter.  Great recipe!

This was wonderful.  And I loved that it is made with ingredients I have readily available.  I followed the advice of others and increased the cinnamon in the batter to 1 TBSP and used brown sugar instead of white on the topping.  My younger son and husband really liked it.  In fact, the next day there was a small piece left and they were arguing over it.  I had to play referee so Dad would share ... go figure.

Very good flavor, but the top of mine was a little burned, while the middle was a little undercooked... I would play with the cooking time/temperature.

Great tasting and easy.  I tripled the topping and used brown sugar for the topping, as most everyone recommends.  I made muffins and layered batter, sugar, batter, sugar, batter, swirl together, top with sugar.  My whole family loved it.  Only thing I would do different is add a bit of flour to the topping mixture, since I too had problems with it not crumbling.

A nice and easy recipe. It's a little sweet so less of a bread, more of a cake.

I don't know what happened, but it came out very dense and "wet", even when I increased the baking time.
Besides that, great flavor.

I made this into 12 muffins. They rose super high, look really pretty, and have a great moist texture. So, I'm giving this recipe 5 stars for texture and appearance and 3 stars for taste, for an average of 4. I agree with the other reviewers who say that the bread itself (not the topping mind you) just doesn't taste like much of anything. And I even added twice the cinnamon called for.

Wasn't so good I expected. I made double topping, but it was too sweet for me. Maybe I made some mistakes, but I read rewievs and tried to do as recommended. I'm afreid I won't do it again.

This bread is absolutely scrumptious!!!  As recommended by other reviewers, I also tripled the brown sugar mixture and sprinkled half in the middle and half on the top, which gave the top a delicious crispy coating.  For me it took 1 hour, 10 minutes to bake, but well worth the wait!  As another reviewer suggested, I also think raisins will go well in this recipe, which I will try the next time I make this bread because I will definitely be making this bread again and again.  Thanks Carol for this keeper!

This was quite good, might add some raisins like other reviewers said, i doubled the topping but didn't layer it which i might try next time. too all those ppl that said the topping sunk to the bottom, i think it might be because u didn't crumble up the mixture fine enough, i used my fingers to break it up a bit and i didn't have any problems with the topping sinking to the bottom. cheers.

Very good and easy.  I will make this again, but next time I will not swirl with a knife as the recipe calls for because I would rather have a crunchy topping.  I would also double the topping mixture.  Overall, I had great reviews.

This was ok, but not the best bread I've ever had. It was just a bit too bland  for me. Maybe more cinnamon and a tad more sugar would help?
Probably wont make again.

Very tasty and worth repeating.  Next time I will definitely double the cinnamon topping (well, it ends up as filling) mixture since that was the best part.

I'm very dissappointed at this bread. It smelled good when it was baking, however, it ended up dry and bland. The top was kinda burn too. I'm definitely not gonna make this one anymore.

Just awesome and very addicting!!  I added a glaze flavored with almond and I drizzled it over the top to make it even more attractive.  I never get swirls even with doubling the mix, but it is soooo yummy!!

Love this recipe.  Took the suggestion of increasing the cinnamon/sugar/butter mixture to swirl through and it worked great.  My family was fighting over the crumbs!

This was tasty,and the texture was nice.I had problems with the cinnamon/sugar/butter part because, even after all of my cutting and swirling, it landed in the middle.  I am searching for good quick bread recipes so I can make mini loaves for gift baskets for the upcoming Intercalary Days (four-day Bahai celebration)  Next time I make it, I'll double the cinnamon/sugar part and spread some in the middle as many suggested.  I will also top it with a powdered sugar glaze.  Thanks for a yummy recipe.

a really nice breakfast bread recipe.  A tad dry, but the flavor was nice...not overpowering or too sweet/cinnamony.  I made it, per the suggestion of a previous reviewer, with the Clone of a Cinnabon icing.  Very, very good.

I have made this bread 3 times already and everytime it came out great.. For the top of the bread I use the icing recipe from Clone of a Cinnabon(also on allrecipes) and it tastes wondeful with it.

This was really moist, but a needed a kick. I think next time I will add a bit more cinnamon and perhaps add some nutmeg for added flavor!

Very Tasty.  We loved the first loaf so much that we decided to make a second one in the very same day!  We will certainly make this one again and again.  A big "thank you" to the person who shared this recipe!

Makes a nice snack bread.  Not too sweet, but lots of cinnamon flavour.  It was hard to wait for this to come out of the oven.  The smell of cinnamon is intoxicating!

This bread is fantastic! I can't believe how easy it was to make, and the results are incredible! I even did the milk and vinegar trick. My bread came out delicious and rose quite high!!  You could do any number of variations on this one...personally, I am going to try adding some orange zest and see what I come out with.  I love the topping, but next time, I will add more simply because it's so yummy! Thank you for a wonderful recipe! I'm planning on baking several loaves of this for gifts at Christmas time!  :-)

What a great bread!!  My whole family really enjoyed it! I doubled the topping recipe and put some of it in the middle as well as on top and swirled it around so you got lots of cinnamon stuff in the middle.  Next time I may even triple it!  It was very tender and moist and rose nice and high.  Wonderful just baked!

I don't know HOW this recipe got so many rave reviews.  It's boring, kind of bland, and a little too oily.  In addition, the topping added towards the end which you are supposed to swirl into the bread ends up cooking on the bottom of the pan.  This recipe may be easy, but there is absolutely nothing original about it.

I have made this many times over and it's always the best cinammon bread ever! Moist and super cinommony! I usually add 3 times as much cinammon as called for and use half brwon sugar instead of all white. I also spray the bread dish with oil and sprinkle cinammon all over the sides and bottom so that cinammon coats the entire loaf and on top too!

I liked the moistness of the bread and it was really good hot out of the oven. The topping was SO good, but the bread was a little bit bland. Once it got cold, it wasn't nearly as good. I might try using this topping on a more flavorful bread or a coffee cake...

Delicious- scrumptious- so good.  and if you dont want to use butter for the topping,do what I did and just mix cinnamon with brown sugar and sprinkle on top.  I was going to add a little raisins on top but added blueberries and it was a great topping that adds variety to it as well.  The whole family loved this different cinnamon bread!

I doubled this recipe easily in my large glass bowl and divided the batter between two loaf pans.  I took one loaf with whipped cream cheese for spreading to a barbecue and everyone loved it.  You should know that this bread is good and simple, not overly sweet or cakelike, which allows for more variety in the spreads department.  A great recipe!!!

Wow!   How can something so easy be so good!!! Don't know what it tastes like cold -- the family demolished it fresh from the oven.  Smells and tastes wonderful!   Thanks for sharing!

This is a simple yet very good recipe for cinnamon bread.  Very moist, firm and tasty.  The men in my home loved it.  Others have requested that I pass on this recipe to them, which is always a compliment

Loved this Cinnamon Bread!  Nice big loaf and moist.  I made the cin. 
topping with soft butter and just dropped it on then mixed it in.  Next time 
I will put the topping in the middle then mix through.  Thanks my family
enjoyed after sledding with Hot Choc.

This is a good recipe. My family liked it. I didn't have any buttermilk so I used regular milk and apple cider vinegar to make one cup.I added one chopped McIntosh apple.I chose McIntosh because they are a soft saucy apple.The topping did seem to settle in the center. Next time I will try to poke the topping down in instead of swirling it through. Overall, this bread was good.

WOW!!!  This is the best tasting Cinnamon Bread I have ever eaten!  I just can't get enough of this delicious bread.  The topping didn't come out right, but still made it taste even better.  I would eat the whole loaf myself, but my family would get angry at me.  Yummy!!!  Mmmmmm!!!!

This has got to be the most decadent and delicious cinnamon bread recipe out there.  I made five loaves as gifts and still had people requesting more.  I will be making this recipe on a regular basis.  The only adjustment I made was, if you are using foil pans, to put the batter into two of them as they are smaller than regular baking pans.  You can take about 5 or 10 minutes off the time if you make them this way.

This is one of the quickest bread recipes I've ever tried.  The wonderful smell fills the house.
I added a chopped apple and nuts to the recipe and also made a struesel topping which came out nice. A very good recipe in which you can add your own little touch if you wish, but isn't necessary. One suggestion, maybe double the recipe so theres enough to go around!  :)

REALLY loved this recipe.  Made two small loaves and cut cooking time by 20 min.  Substituted butter for oil and no problems.  Moist, cooked evenly, had a problem with the topping though.  Couldn't seem to marble it properly but it didn't matter because it cooked into the bread and gave it a sweet kick.  I bake A LOT and my boyfriend will attest this is probably one of the best...THANKS!

I usually get great results with the recipes that are rated with 4 stars or higher.  However, I was very disappointed with this recipe.  The bread was very bland and dry.

The first time I made this it was perfect. Subsequently, I've problems with the cinnamon/sugar topping sinking through the loaf, which then causes the loaf to stick to the pan! Not sure why. The bread is very good, though.

Super recipe!  It was delicous with a powdered sugar glaze drizzled over the top while still warm from the oven.

This loaf was really moist and delicious!  I added extra topping about 15 minutes into the baking, and I swirled the first topping inside the loaf so that when you cut into it, you got some cinnamon swirls in the middle.  Really yummy!

Overall this recipe is very simple and basic with a lovely end result.  I think I would double the topping for more evident marbling, otherwise, this recipe is perfect.  

By the By, my husband just loved it.

I made this on a Saturday morning and there was nothing left by Saturday afternoon.  I had to make another loaf for Sunday.  My husband and father-in-law just couldn't get enough of it.  Thank you for sharing such a great recipe!

I really liked this recipe, but added some Pecans to the top.  I had to add an additional 10 minutes because the center was not cooked all the way through.

I first made this recipe with plain milk, and it was good, but the topping fell into the bread.  Then I made it with the milk+vinegar combo, and it turned out great, even the topping stayed on top!  Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing!!

I have started making this bread for a kid at my church that has cancer.  She is 11 years old, and now looks forward for my visit each week.  Her mom told me this is the first thing she has really liked since becoming sick.  So thank you for this wonderful recipe.

My husband and I both really enjoyed the bread.  I mixed cinnamon & sugar (kitten britches) with cream cheese and used it as a spread on the bread.  What a great combination!  This will definately go in my favorites file!
