I made a few changes, based on what I had in the house, but I think it might have been even better as written. I used boneless skinless chicken thighs instead of turkey (they were great, and I always have a package in the freezer), and dried ground sage (lots of it!) instead of fresh, because my supermarket was out of fresh sage when I shopped. Raves from everyone! Even the kid who won't eat pasta (in any form) loved the chicken and sauce (with roasted squash and crusty bread).
