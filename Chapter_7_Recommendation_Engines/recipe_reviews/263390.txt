I used about 2/3 C of cherry tomatoes cut in half, reduced cayenne to a pinch and subbed whole milk for cream. I think I also reduced salt down to 1 tsp., but I don't remember for sure now... but with the salty olives and capers, I doubt I'd put in 2 tsp. of salt. This was good and worth making again.

Very tasty and easy to prepare.  The cayenne pepper adds a nice "zip" to the flavour.

I had leeks and shrimp and did an ingredient search and found this delicious recipe.  I used frozen shrimp since that's what I had on hand. Just thawed it first under running water. Also didn't have heavy cream, so I used some milk and a tablespoon or so of sour cream. Served it on rice fettuccine pasta. Hubby declared it "scrumptious." No photo because we ate it too quickly!
