Eggs benedict is my all time favorite way of eating eggs. I was cooking for a crowd, so to make this dish even quicker and easier, I used a packaged hollandaise sauce that only needed a couple of added ingredients and was done right on top of the stove. Didn't have any canadian bacon on hand, so I used taylor ham. Remember to use the vinegar in the water as it helps the egg whites hold together. Yummy!!

The one and only change I would make is to reduce the amount of salt in the hollandaise sauce to 1/4 tsp. The way the recipe stands now, you can use it providing you don't add any salt to your eggs, but the sauce alone is just a tiny bit too salty. Aside from that, it was absolutely divine! I will make this again - many times!

I really loved the hollandaise sauce, it was the best recipe I've tried. My boyfriend and I do not eat pork so we substituted smoked salmon for the ham and also added wilted spinach. Also, we didn't have any english muffins so we used whole wheat toast instead. I'll definately be making this again, thanks!

I had ever made hollandaise sauce before and used this recipe for Christmas morning breakfast. We served 11 adults and 3 children with one recipe of this sauce! It was extremely easy and very good. We used english muffins, country ham, and either fried or scrambled eggs (nobody liked poached) topped with the hollandaise sauce. It was excellent and even reheated ok in the microwave.

This was quick and tasted pretty good. Use eggs that have been pasteurized in the shell (yes, it's possible!) to avoid issues with salmonella.

I found this sauce thickened up really quickly in the food processor.  It congealed on me, and then when I warmed it up it was runny.

Eggs Benedict is my favorite breakfast. I've had it in hundreds (literally) of restaurants coast-to-coast and beyond. So, I've become quite an expert at preparing and tasting it. Therefore, with much hesitation I finally decided I would try this method of making hollandaise. It was truly an experiment and whoever thought of it has never tasted true hollandaise. Avoid this blender method at all cost. It is not fool-proof. First off, this method does not make hollandaise. It makes a warm mixture of whipped (mostly raw) egg and butter with a little flavoring thrown in. You're better off warming up some sour cream and squeezing in some lemon and food coloring! I really hate to be so critical but I'm embarassed I even tried this in a blender. To make true hollandaise it takes high quality ingredients, the right equipment, and the right METHOD. The egg should be cooked slowly while be whipped to prevent curdling by using HEAT from the double-boiler (not from the butter!). Use WHITE pepper. A true hollandaise should be creamy with that wonderful hint of fresh lemon and should NEVER taste or feel buttery in the mouth as this recipe does. I threw my blender batch out and made it properly. It only took about 7-8 minutes and was luxurious.

I made this recipe and it was very good.  I had never used cream in my blender hollandaise but it was a nice touch and made for a bit creamier taste.  As far as a simmer is concerned.... simmer means little tiny bubbles on the bottom of the pan... I have NEVER had a problem cooking eggs at a true simmer and no problem this time.
INDRIANI,  I think this is a fine recipe and thank you for your contribution!

I had never made eggs Benedict before so I didn't really know what to expect. My sauce was a little thin but I microwaved it (you're probably not meant to do that) and it thickened up. I used bottled lemon juice and couldn't tell that I hadn't used fresh which is convenient. I served it on toasted homemade bread and though it didn't wow me it made a very nice meal.

Laughably easy, and incredibly delicious. Be careful to add melted butter very slowly so that it will emulsify correctly. Also, watch for splashback on the butter. Yuck! I tried using buttered sour dough toast instead of the traditional muffins. Worked great! Make the whole dish much lighter. I agree that a full boil on the water will overcook your eggs--did mine.

Use a "packaged mix, just add splash of lemon juice just before you are done BAM! Finished, Great, Easy "no difference!" Sprinkel with cayene pepper. If you "don't want to mess with "poached eggs, fry them..

Fantastic!!!  I made this for my dad for fathers day (eggs benedict is his FAVORITE) and he loved it!!!  Definitely cut the salt in half though, it would be way too salty with the original amount.  All in all fantastic though!  Thank you for sharing this!!  Keep posting fabulous recipes!  :)

Loved this recipe, so did the 8 people I made it for Easter brunch in a guest house on vacation!. To change things up a bit, instead of Canadian bacon, I used lox and put it on a bed of chopped cooked spinach. You can double or triple the recipe very easily. With the leftovers, I served it several times, once on poached salmon and then on steamed broccoli. This is such an each recipe and I didn't have any of the thinness problems other reviewers reported, just make sure the butter is hot enough to cook the egg yolks.

Our classroom made this recipe. The butter is overwhelming and the sauce was too runny.  We cut the salt in half and it was still too salty.  We ended up draining off half the butter and adding more cayenne.  That helped.  I would make it with 1/2 the butter and 1/4 the salt listed.  And double the cayenne.  Then it made a nice sauce!

As others have commented the sauce was runny, and just an overwhelming buttery mess. I took a bite and I just couldn't eat it. And I was embarrassed that I thought that this "quick and easy" method would work. The instructions in the recipe do not make a hollandaise sauce, do not think otherwise.

I am extremely disappointed with this recipe. I should have known that proper eggs benedict takes longer than 15 minutes to put together. The sauce did not thicken (and I kept the blender going for 20 minutes) and the end result was a soggy, buttery mess.

I don't add salt as I used salted butter. The cream is unnecessary and dilutes the flavor. I run hot water in the blender just prior to using it as it cuts down on the congealing. Other wise this is a wonderful recipe for eggs benedict and I've been using it for years! So easy too! Also, try to find plastic mircowave egg poachers. These are wonderful and so easy  to use!

This was pretty good and easy enough to make.  I liked that you didn't have to use the stove for the sauce.  The sauce was ok but there was something about it that tasted different from other eggs benedict sauces.  We made it for a brunch I had with female family members and most of us liked it!

This is actually very good, but really, you don't need the salt, especially if you use salted butter or margarine. It's just as easy for each person to add their own salt at the table when you serve this meal. I have an egg poacher that makes it much easier to make the eggs than dropping them into vinegar water. Not that this method is difficult, but since this recipe was designed to make this dish simple as well as delicious, you will do yourself a favor by purchasing a poacher, which you can find in the cookware section of any big box store.
If you're concerned about consuming raw eggs, then buy pasteurized eggs - problem solved!

It's a bit salty as written and I have to agree with another poster who said boost the cayenne...maybe quite a bit, I used ''3 dashes'' and it could barely be detected...otherwise, yum!

This recipe was very good! It is easier to do when you have an egg poacher. But, other then that it was very tasty and my family really enjoyed it.

I have made this twice; the first time I made the recipe to a T, I didn't change a thing and I enjoyed it very much.  This morning, however, I changed it up by adding spinach, more cayenne pepper, absolutely NO salt, and used regular ham.  Still tasted great.  Thanks.

When I followed the instructions as written, my poached eggs were a disaster, falling apart on the slotted spoon after sticking to the bottom of the saucepan.  My husband said I had too much water in the saucepan, and too little vinegar for the amount of water.  He recommended that I use a non-stick frying pan (12 in), with about an inch of water and the tsp of vinegar.  Done that way, my eggs came out perfectly after 3/4 minutes.  The sauce rated an "OK" from him, but there was still entirely too much of it for 4 servings, even though I reduced the amount of butter to 1/2 cup and the egg yolks to 2.  Next time I give Eggs B. a try, I will look for another recipe.

For the lazy & impatient: Since I rarely have Canadian bacon in the fridge, I substitute left over ham or sliced ham from the deli. I use a hollandaise mix (Knorrs, McCormick, etc) and instead of poaching the eggs, I use a cup sprayed with Pam & microwave an egg.

Yummy, yummy, yummy!  My husband and kids always ask for this for their special meals, like birhtdays and such.  I just use smoked salmon instead of the Canadian bacon and it tastes super good!  Thanks for the recipe!

PS - agree on the salt...doesn't need it.

Pretty good overall, but the hollandaise came out with a very strong butter taste.  I'll reduce the amount of butter next time and maybe put a little heavy cream in it.

I will omit the salt next time (the sauce was a tad too salty for me), but otherwise this was a hit!

While the basics of the concept were good, the sauce turned out awful. I make eggs Benedict every year for my husband's birthday with smoked salmon but I usually use Julia Child's recipe from French cooking. This year I'm moving and my book was packed so I decided to give this a go and the sauce was very thin, tasteless and didn't come together well. Very disappointed

I think the food processor / blender is not the way to go with this one. Too much air forced into the eggs, it congealed and then quickly fell apart once it hit the plate. The taste wasn't bad, but if you're looking for something to present for a gathering, this isn't the method to pick.

We did this poor-man's style since it was off the cuff and I was missing C-bacon and E-muffs. Turned out fine with toast and regular bacon.

Hollindase was very good, made it with my blender and dribbled in hot butter/lemon.  

Served with has brown instead of muffins.

I tried this recipe with coconut milk (full fat from a can) and it worked great! I would reduce the salt by at least half though--it was WAY salty. I ended up adding more coconut milk to reduce the salty flavor. But if you're looking to make it dairy-free, it works really well!

As written, it turns out bland. I added extra cayenne. The bigger problem is that it's super runny I'm thinking one just has to do the slow double-boiler method to make proper hollandaise.

Great recipe but sauce was a little salty using salted butter. I suggest either using unsalted butter or eliminating or reducing the salt. Also, this amount of sauce will make more than just 4 muffins. It will probably make 6 if you like a lot of sauce and 8 if you like a little.

I have always loved Eggs Benedict but never tried to make them myself. Made this for Easter brunch last year and it was a big hit.  The sauce was easy to make and turned out great.  This Easter I have been asked by my familly to make these again.  Thanks you for sharing.

I was always afraid to make my own eggs benedict but this recipe was quick and easy! It tasted terrific :) I did reduce the amount of butter to a 1/4 c. because we just wanted to drizzle the sauce and just a dash of salt and it still came out perfect.
