This recipe is wonderful. I used to work at a pizza parlor and we made a recipe very similar to this one that was very popular especially during Lent. The vegetables that we used that I think are the perfect combination are broccoli, drained canned mushrooms, drained canned black olives, red onion, and the special touch is one tomato diced. My husband who usually wants to try new recipes all the time, asks for this one at least every other week. Great recipe!

The only reason i tried this recipe was because of the reviews.  My first reaction was...whaa?  Pizza and NO sauce?  And ranch dressing in place of it? Ew!  I am Italian and just never put ranch on my pizza dough.  I tried it...oh my gosh is it deeeeelicious!  My husband loved it, my kids loved it... I used my own pizza dough, and I sauteed everything in butter but the broccoli, which I boiled first.  I know the butter takes away from the healthiness, but who cares.  It helped the veggies become nice and tender before cooking.  This recipe is *wonderful*!!!!

Even as a vegetarian pizza lover, I winced at the sight of this originally. 
I gave the pizza a try any way. 

Don't worry about measuring or the toppings. I followed a few suggestions on this site and came up with this - 
- Boboli's pre-baked pizza crust
- I used Kraft's Light Done Right Three-Cheese salad dressing.
- Shredded pizza blend cheese 
- I mixed up up the veggies, usually using broccoli, carrots and tomatoes 

Careful -- it's addicting!

I followed some other's suggestions and didn't use as much ranch and sauteed the veggies a bit before putting them on the crust.  I used sliced red pepper instead of cauliflower and added some crushed red pepper for spice.  Delicious, thanks for the idea.

This recipe was easy to make, and a great way to use up extra veggies.  You definitely don't need all the toppings to enjoy this.  I left out the cauliflower, and added some sliced tomato.  One note regarding the amount of ranch.  I just poured a little bit on the pizza dough and used a spatula to gently even it out.  Then I poured a little more, until the dough was covered.  It's much easier and probably healthier since I didn't use close to 1 1/2 cups.

I was a little scared to try this recipe, but it was delicious!!  I used the Pilsbury pre-made pizza crust and I found that it's better if you cook the pizza crust half way and then add all your toppings and then finish cooking.   A absolutely wonderful substitution for tomatoes!

Wow! This is great pizza! Never would have thought it with the ranch dressing.  Have made this twice......first time I followed the recipe exactly but used a garlic ranch dressing as sauce.
Great! The garlic added a nice flavor.  The second time I used  Ragu light alfredo sauce as a base cause I was craving the pizza and was out of ranch dressing.  This was equally as great!  Big hit at my house.  Love all the cheese too!  Thanks, Darlene - this is definitely a favorite.

This is a wonderful recipe!  My husband loved it and I make it about once a week now.  The only change I made was to cut down on the amt. of dressing.  And insted of regular ranch I use Kraft Light Done Right Three Cheese Ranch.  It's like eating gourmet food!!

This is a GREAT veggie pizza that is not the standard cream cheese appetizer thing. Loved it, (especially with "Jay's Signature Pizza Crust" from Allrecipes.com)Can't wait to make it again~

Amazing pizza...the flavors were great and the dough was amazing too.  Here's my spin: I used a 2lb breadmachine dough recipe.  I sautaed onions, broccoli, crimini mushrooms and green peppers for a few mintues in olive oil.  I took 2tbs of melter butter and  touch of garlic salt to spread along the crust. Used just enough lite ranch to cover the dough.  i used 8oz mozzerlla and about 4oz of provalone cheese on top.  Provolone is a great pizza cheese that is overlooked.  baked at 400 until golen brown.  check out my picture it's the big square pizza

All I can say is YUMMY, but you don't need to use all that ranch dressing.

The best way to make this pizza is to mix a block of cream cheese, 1/4-1/2 cup mayo and a packet of ranch seasoning mix in place of using bottled ranch.

This pizza is great!! I've never tried a pizza with ranch dressing in it.  I love it. Instead of a pizza crust on a baking sheet, I used a package of crescent rolls and a 13x9 pan.  It worked just fine.  Thank you so much for putting this recipe up!

Surprisingly good!  I wasn't sure what to expect with this recipe, but I was extremely pleased with the result and my guests loved it!  I ended up cutting a little of the ranch dressing out, as it seemed to call for a large amount.  It has an interesting mix of flavors, and cooks to perfection.  I'd definitely make it again.

the idea was nice for a non vegetarian but myself being a vegetarian i hod to omit the ranch(contains anchovies-they are under the list of natural ingredient) and i used rennet free cheese instead since i couldn't find any meatless ranch... the family who did try the ranch pizza thought it was okay but preferred the regular version...

This tasted so goooood. I did use only 1 cup of ranch dressing instead of 1 1/2 and still had dressing pouring over the sides. I also had veggies left over so I could have even made two pizzas, which I wish I did because one pizza just wasn't enough!

Mmmmmm.  This was so good.  I used 1 cup ranch mixed with 1/2 cup salsa to jazz it up a little.  Perfect!

We LOVE this pizza! I have made it twice now, using different veggies each time, and once adding some grilled chicken. The ranch dressing just gives an incredible taste and a change to the usual pizza. This has become a favourite of ours and will be made MANY times! Thanks for such a great idea!

I have been making this pizza for a couple of years and never make it exactly the same.  I just use whatever I have on hand. I do rub some minced garlic onto the crust before adding the ranch dressing.  Adds a great flavor.  My husband says this is the best pizza anywhere!

I used one recipe of the Amazing Whole Wheat Pizza Crust and made my own fat-free sour cream/cream cheese ranch from scratch. I only used a minimal amount of shredded mozzerella on the top to lower the fat content and eliminated the cheddar cheese all together. I used red onion and omitted the cauliflower as my family dosen't care for it. Even as a cold pizza and making it with low calorie ingredients and with less cheese, this was tasty.....even to the husband!

Great pizza, made it with Jay's Signature Pizza Crust.  Added the kids favorite veggies (though my youngest kept looking for veggies he thought I tried to sneak in!)  and they felt it was a keeper. I like the meatless alternative to dinner.

Blech.  Where to start....?  3/4 cup of ranch was more than enough - I can't even imagine 1 & 1/2 cups!  Half the cheese was enough.  My kids could still smell the cauliflower over the Ranch & under the cheese.

This is so good!  I think the broccoli and carrots really make this dish.  I didn't use cauliflower, because I was afraid they'd be hard, but otherwise I followed the recipe to a T.  Wonderful!

Good recipe, although I bought a smaller pizza crust, not realizing it till later, and tried to pile all of those ingredients on it. Needless to say there were way too many toppings, however not the fault of the recipe! It was still really yummy.

The photo is before I added all the extra toppings like tomatos, mushrooms, croutons, sunflower seeds, peppers, Turkey bacon, and onions.  Hoping my southern husband likes eating healthy since he's traditionally into fried foods. With him being diabetic I'm teaching him new ways to eat healthy.  One thing I forgot was I added a caulifour crust to eliminate the bread he can't have.

I did it on a gluten free 7 in. crust. I also added a few more veggies like yellow squash, zucchini, and green peppers. I also added mild cheddar cheese.

I make veggie ranch pizzas all summer right out of the garden...Yum! Instead of cauliflower & broccoli, I use zucchini and yellow squash, japanese eggplant, carrots, mushrooms, spinach and for some protein...(Trust me, it's good)...sunflower seeds!

350 degrees was not hot enough to cook the crust, after 20 minutes, the veggies were soft, but the crust was not fully cooked.  Increase temp or par-bake the crust before adding toppings. I used Kraft Cucumber Ranch Light dressing; good flavor, similar to the gormet pizza at our local take & bake.

This is a yummy pizza that can suit anyone's tastes!  I skipped the cheddar cheese and just spooned ranch dressing on the crust untill I figured it was enough.  I sauted onions and mushrooms in some olive oil with minced garlic and steamed some broccoli.  I also topped the pizza off with tomatoes and green olives.  VERY TASTEY and we'll be making this again!

I'm sure it's my fault this was not good. I don't recommend using olives, for one. And i used the powder ranch mixed with plain yogurt to cut the fat. Don't try to cut the fat with this recipe. That's the best part.

It was ok. Next time I will try Caesar style dressing and parm cheese, with the veggies to better match my tastes.

This is a wonderful recipe. I made this for my 6 & 8 year old boys last night & they loved it...but then they both love broccoli & mushrooms. I made my own crust, didn't use as much ranch or cheese and used broccoli slaw mix and fresh sliced mushrooms on it. I also sprinkled some onion & garlic powder and dried basil on the veggies before adding the last layer of cheese (I used an italian blend of shredded cheeses). Next time I think I will use more ranch as that flovor didn't come through as well as I had hoped and I will add shredded carrot as well. Using the shredded broccoli made it easier to eat than had I used florets I think.

I must say, this dish was hot!!!! my family recently turned vegetarian (lacto-ovo) and I was clueless on what to make. Everything I put together was quite horrible. Thank god for the internet, now I have a unlimited food source!! The ranch dressing added a little zing and a double BAM! I will definitely keep this reciepe a top 10. 

Didn't think I would like this pizza but when I tasted it......loved it. HELLO!

My husband (carnivore) and I (vegetarian) eat alot of pizza.  I made this recipe to add some variety to our pizza routine.  We agreed that it is not a great way to eat pizza, but it is a pretty good way to eat cauliflower.  The combination of vegetables is good, but the ranch sauce is overpowering.

As far as ingredients I used all that was called for. As for the  amounts, I changed the ranch and cheese amounts.  The veggie amounts were perfect.  I used low-fat ranch (about a 1/2 cup-I will use more next time, maybe a cup...as this is the seasoning!) The cheddar...I used 3/4 cup and for the mozzarella I used about 1 cup grated (maybe about 1/4 pound).  All of the changes drastically change the fat intake.  Since I did not try it any other way I cannot compare.  I thought it was tasty and look forward to mixing up the veggies a little...the cauliflower was a little strong in the flavor department...

I tried this pizza, used a couple different ingredients (yellow peppers, pineapple, mushroom, onion), was not a fan of it.  The ranch taste was way too strong (overpowering) and I only used one cup of the dressing.  Also had to let it sit for 30 minutes after it came out of the oven because the ranch was too watery.

Excellent Pizza, and the strange thing is, I normally HATE ranch. So I only used about 1/2 cup for the sauce. Baked it with a ready made crust, and also I brushed on some olive oil before adding toppings. Pizza was fantastic, and I never thought I would ever say this but could have used more ranch..Will add more next time. For a veggie Pizza, this one is a winner. And normally I hate veggie pizza too. This one however tasted so much different then others I have had.  5 STARS ALL THE WAY.

Had to give this the benefit of the doubt, since I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I used a Boboli pizza crust, as I could not find a refrigerated pizza dough to use. I just used as much Ranch dressing for the sauce as I wanted, I didn't measure it. The pizza ended up a bit watery, and it may have been because we used a few more veggies than the recipe called for. We also used less cheese. In all, we didn't really like this, but it could've just been our personal tastes. I don't think there was anything wrong with the recipe. Won't make again though.
