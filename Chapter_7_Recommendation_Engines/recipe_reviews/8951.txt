Excellent, tasty recipe.  I used large boneless breasts, and added 1/4 cup of orange marmalade, as suggested by another cook.  I also added 1 tablespoon of dried minced onion. Tender and tangy.  I served it with potatoes au gratin, and a romaine and cucumber salad tossed in lemon olive oil.  Nice combination.  Will definitely make this one again.  Can't wait to try it on the grille, too.

Great. Marinated overnight and then the next day added the soy sauce and honey 30 mins prior to baking. Added other spices such as onion powder, garlic powder, pepper, fresh onions, etc.

Tangy and tasty. Like another reviewer I, too, used the marinade on 4 boneless breasts instead of a whole chicken. I would like to try it with a whole chicken because I suspect it would be more juicy. But my boyfriend says he doesn't care much for anything but the boneless breasts...oh well. Anyhow, it's still good and we agreed we'd both like to eat it again. I took the suggestion of another reviewer and added a tablespoon of dried minced onion. On my next try, I will add the marmalade as suggested and that should liven up the slight dryness of the boneless breasts. If using the skinless, boneless breasts, I think the dish is best enjoyed fresh and not as a leftover. But I would even make it again anyhow. I served mine with fettucini alfredo.

Excellent marinade! I really liked this. Watch the cook time, though, my chicken breasts were somewhat thin and came out a bit chewy. I doubled the marinade to be sure I'd have plenty left over to make into sauce, and it was perfect! Thanks!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I used b/s chicken breasts, o.j. concentrate rather than orange juice and I added some marmelade.
I cooked it on top of the stove and thickened the sauce with cornstarch after the chicken was done. Served with brown rice. 
It's going into my "favorites" file.

This recipe gives a good flavor to baked chicken pieces.  I added fresh, ground ginger and a little orange marmalade.  Very good!

This was really great!  I used orange juice concentrate to increase the orange flavor, and some red pepper flakes to kick it up a notch.  Perfect served over rice, using extra sauce as a gravy.

This has a good taste, but it could be cooked  1 hour instead of 1 1/2.  It was dry after that long.

This is great! I marinated my chicken in Orange juice, honey, and cut garlic cloves for about 3 hours before I baked it. Then, when I baked it I just coated each strip in honey, sprinkled the herbs and pinned the oranges on with toothpicks. Just pour your marinade in with it to let it simmer while baking to add that extra flavor.

We make this chicken so often I now scale the recipe to 20 servings, buy a very large pack of boneless skinless chicken breast, fill small freezer bags with 3 chicken breast (to suite my families needs) and then fill the bag with marinade. Then we have a moist and delicious entree on hand. Just pull out of the freezer and thaw in fridge or defrost in microwave. Wonderful!!!

This was really good.  I did goof though. I cut up the chicken breasts instead of leaving whole pieces.  Read the recipe too fast.  Still turned out excellent.  Just adjusted cooking time to 30 min.  Sauce was delicious also.  So, if you want to try this recipe and make it FAST, cut chicken breasts in 1 inch pieces, put everything in pyrex and bake at 350 for 30 min.  Served it with steamed broccoli and wedged parmasean potatoes.  The sauce complimented the broccoli well.  Might try adding some nuts to the chicken for some crunch.

Thanks for the recipe.

This made a good dinner. I used 3 breast halves, but there was enough marinade for at least 4. I baked it for 45 minutes and it came out tender. I simmered the marinade from the baking pan on the stove with 1 rounded tsp. of cornstarch to make a nice sauce. Served it over rice. I did make one change to the ingredients - used 1/4 cup OJ concentrate instead of regular OJ. My kids ate it up.

Very nice recipe!  I use just thighs and drumsticks and add 2 more cloves of garlic.  I put it all in a Ziploc for a day or 2 in the fridge--turning it every 8-12 hours and then during the week I have a quick and easy meal by just making rice and broccoli to go with it.  By marinating 2-3 days, the meat is really tender and full of flavor.

Excellent recipe, my family loved it. The sauce was thin and it needed more orange juice. I did add minced onion and a little red pepper flakes like the other reviews suggested. I will make it again.

This was just ok.  To me it was to sweet but thats just me. I only used half the oregano called for but you could still taste it. I guess it just wasn't my thing. I used thin chicken breast and they came out very tender maybe it would be better with bone in chicken?

It was good, but not my favorite. My boyfriend seemed to really like it though. I doubt I'll make it again. If I do make it again I would nix the soy sauce and maybe add pineapple juice instead.

I recently made this dish and my family loved it. Tonight, I asked my family what they wanted for dinner and my semi-picky 6 y.o. son said he wanted that yummy garlic chicken for dinner. I was shocked, but we're having it tonight. It's great. I have been using boneless, skinless chicken breasts, for ease and quickness. Also, for those of you who have the vacuum sealing machines, this works great. I just put the marinade in my container, throw the chicken in and seal it up. It marinates between 20 & 30 minutes instead of 2-4 hours. Thanks for the great chicken, Leah!

I used pheasant breast instead of chicken. Work beautifully. Watch cook time as others have said. I go by internal temp of the meat rather than a certain time for cooking.

I pan fried this great recipe. Fried thighs and strips until slightly browned on both sides. Then let it simmer in the sauce turning several times. Added more fresh squeezed orange juice. A little too salty, I didn't measure the soy. Next time I will double the sauce and taste test the soy before doubling it. I loved the flavor.

I decided to make this based on all the good reviews. I followed the ingredients and directions exactly. This tasted like I used a store bought marinade. The oregano just didn't taste like it belonged in this recipe. My children and husband didn't care for it either. I definitely won’t be making this again.

Tasty! This has so much flavor! I did not cook the chicken for 1-1/2 hours, I feel that is too long to cook chicken for. I suggest 30 minutes at 375.came out very juicy and tender. I did add the marmalade and fresh chopped onions, and sauteed the garlic before adding to marinade. This combination made a yummy orangey glaze that was de-lish! Will make again!

I used boneless/skinless chicken breasts and reduced the cook time to 1 hour.  The meat was juicy and tender and overall tasted great!  Next time, I'd like to try a couple of suggestions from previous cooks.  Thanks for sharing!

VERY GOOD!  My husband and I both liked it, which is almost unheard of.  Putting this one in our "family favorites" section of my cookbook.  5 STARS!

Very good!! I used skinless, boneless breasts like always. Baked about 45 minutes, but would go for 35-40 next time. A good low carb choice.

Marinade is awesome! Not too sweet, and made the chicken turn golden brown and crispy skin on top in the oven. I HIGHLY recommend using chicken with bone and skin on. I noticed from other reviews that people complained their chicken came out too dry and I think it's because they used skinless and boneless chicken which will dry out super fast in the oven even if you double the marinade, etc. I baked the chicken with potatoes, carrots, and onions but I wish I had fresh veggies to go as a side instead. Definitely will try this recipe again soon!

We enjoyed the recipe, I used chicken breast instead of the whole chicken.  I didn't like the oregano, so next time will probably skip it.  Served with rice and veges was a good warm meal.

Tasted excellent. Would give a 5 star rating if I didn't change things. I reduced the soy sauce to 2 tbsp so that I could actually taste the orange juice, and I added dashes of onion and garlic powder. Served over rice with broccoli and it was delicious.

I was the only one who ate this and I did enjoy it but wish there would have been more of an orange taste.  Maybe using concentrate instead of orange juice would help.  I used garlic powder instead of cloves and used tenderloins rather than a whole chicken.  I was pressed for time so I wasn't able to let this marinate but enjoyed it all the same.  Thanks Leah.

This was very nice. I used chicken breasts cut up into pieces and doubled the marinade as I prefer more sauce to go over rice. A very easy and healthy dish.

Easy and tasty. Unfortunately the night I made this, as it was marinating,,,ALL THE LIGHTS AND POWER WENT OUT!! Yes, the Blackout of 2003!! But, I was able to cook this on the grill!! It had a nice flavor but I am sure it is much better baked in the oven, will have to try it again!! Thanks!

This was ok. It made the chicken flavorful, but I couldn't really taste any flavors besides soy and garlic. Still, an easy way to change chicken around.

It's a great recipe for potato lovers. I was especially fond of the flavor that the mayonaise provided. It was a unique change from the regular potato dishes that I usually make....

very good.  I made it along with another recipe from saladrecipe.com called Bodacious Broccoli Salad.  I think they complimented each other pretty well.  I used this marinade on 4 chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken.  However, the bone-in chicken (as the recipe calls for) would be more juicy.

Made this with boneless, skinless chicken breasts. Doubled the recipe because the breasts were ginormous, I had to butterfly them. Used oj concentrate instead of juice, didn't want to spend $ on marmalade, (since I don't like it and would never use it after the recipe) like others did. Only had 2 garlic cloves, I definitely would like to have had more garlic. I will add fresh ginger next time and am looking forward to trying it as a grilling marinade. Family liked it probably more than I did. I'll make it again.

I think I marinated too long (overnight) because the orange flavor was mostly lost in the soy flavor.  I'll try again re-rate this.  It was good though.

Used orange marmalade instead of juice and added minced onion as suggested in reviews. Made an extra batch of the marinade and drizzled over rice. It was delicious!! My boyfriend and I loved it, will be making this again!

I added extra garlic cloves to the marinade, marinated chicken breasts then grilled. This tasted great! We didn't really like the oregano, so we might leave that out next time.

I made the marinade and let the chicken sit in it overnite. Then my hubby grilled it, instead of baking, absolutely wonderful! I did add the orange marmalade to the marinade, and it was less sweet than I expected, perfect!!

This recipe yielded a very mildly flavored chicken.  I was hoping for something with more "bang for my buck."  If I make this again, I will definitely add more garlic and something like red pepper flakes to add some flavor.

THIS IS HEAVENLY! The only change I made was to use Italian seasoning instead of the oregano. I doubled the sauce, marinated with half, and baked with half. I will be serving this as the main dish for my first Christmas hosting the in-laws as a newlywed. IT'S THAT GOOD.

Very easy and full of flavor.  I mixed the marinade and added it to a ziploc bag with a couple of frozen chicken breasts.  Let it defrost and marinate in the refrigerator overnight.  The only suggestion I would make to the marinade is to add a bit more orange juice and honey to balance the soy sauce.  I baked the boneless, skinless chicken at 350 for about 20 minutes covered and 15 minutes uncovered, basting several times.

Very watery and though I followed it exactly, it tasted rather bland. I think I might try this pan fried or grilled next time, but baking really didn't work out so well.

I used chicken breast.  Maybe next time I'll use a whole chicken.  It was just OK for me...not as much flavor as I had hoped.  Leftover were kind of weird, too.

I loved the marinade!  I chose to use chicken breast rather than a whole chicken, though, so that cut down on cook time.  30-45 minutes at most, since you don't want to dry out the meat.  I've made this a few times now, and it's always delicious.  Sometimes I double up on the OJ, but it's tasty with the original recipe, too!

Couldn't taste the orange or honey at all. Next time I'll halve the soy sauce and double the orange juice and honey.

This is not what I expected. The marinade was too thin and didn't really stay on the chicken. Maybe if I had thickened it and poured it on the chicken it would have been better. I Couldn't really taste the orange juice or honey.

This is a good recipe, but I like to use chicken breast instead of bone in. I added zest from a whole orange and used a cube of garlic AND 2 fresh cloves of garlic. Also I added 2 dashes of powdered red pepper, and 2 dashes of salt. It turned out wonderful, very citrusy and flavorful. I served it over white rice and served with fresh steamed veggies. Very healthy and tasty!

It seemed more soy sauce than orange and honey. That however, could be because as Asians, our standard soy sauce is stronger in intensity than Western soy sauces, I think. Other than that warning, quite an easy recipe to make, with ingredients that are relatively affordable worldwide.

Not out of this world good, but still pretty tasty. I really liked the garlic, however I dont think this tasted much of orange or honey! Next time I will use orange concentrate to kick up the flavor..I will play around with the ingredients a little next time and we'll see.

Fantastic meal! Having to start cooking lowfat foods for health reasons I was concerned but this recipe converted me forever! Not only did I love it but so did my husband and 5 yr old daughter. I only marinated for an hour and that was plenty! Will definately pass this one along!

I don't care for dark meat but I picked up some drumsticks on sale in hopes of finding something to do with them. THIS IS IT!!!!!  I marinated them for 24 hours using this recipe and then baked them at 375 for an hour in the marinade. They turned out so flavorful and moist. I can't wait to make them again.

I did the same as a lot of reviewers and used chicken breasts, minced onion and orange marmalade.  My hubby thought this was a fantastic dish.  I served this with rice and salad.  Next time I serve this hubby wants more sauce.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was pretty good.  I used 5 chicken breasts cut into bite sized cubes, used just orange concentrate and actually doubled the marinade recipe to have some more sauce with the chicken.  It wasn't quite as 'orangey' as I hoped it would be, but still pretty good.  I served it over steamed white rice and found that putting some soy sauce over the cooked mix actually brought out a little more orange flavor.  thanks for the recipe!

Cut up chicken into chunks and put them on skewers for the grill.  I liked the flavor but the chicken itself was a little dry.  I liked the flavor enough to try it again with a different cooking method.

I made this recipe with two large chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken, doubled the garlic and marinated it over night.  It wasn't one of my favorite chicken recipes, but my husband thought it was good.  I probably won't make it again.

I love this recipe.  It is so easy to prepare and has a wonderful flavor.  I agree with some of the other comments that it is a bit watery in the dish, maybe cooking it on a rack would help.  We will be making this again!

Yum, yum, yum!  Smells wonderful baking and tasted excellent.  Juicy, tender, delectable.  My only complaint is that the chicken was getting a bit crispy on top, but that's only a small complaint as we like it that way!  Next time, I want to try this on the grill!

This marinade was good. It was not a 5 star, but still good. It is simple to make and similar to a sweet and sour chicken or any other type of teriyaki/soy marinade. I'll make it again though, because it was so easy and was just different enough to make making it worthwhile.

I was really disappointed in this dish.  It looked much better than it tasted.  I did make a few changes.  I used chicken breast tenders cut into pieces, which turned out nice and juicy.  However, I took the advice of another reviewer and used orange marmalade instead of orange juice, and it turned out too orangey.  I'm not sure if I'll make this again, but if I do I will use more honey, which I could not taste at all this time.

I loved this recipe!!! I made very few changes. I had no fresh garlic so I used a teaspoon of garlic powder. I do not like oregano so I left it out. I also left the chicken whole. I injected the chicken with some of the marinade and then baked at 325 for 2 hours, basting every twenty minutes. I really had trouble distinguishing the taste of oranges in the chicken which was great since I didnt want an overpowering flavor of oranges. I will be making this again.

Not a great recipe, even after following other reviewers suggestions.  I added marmalade but it still lacked flavor for me.  I did not like the look of it after cooking in the oven so I pan fried it for a bit.  I ended up saving it by making the sauce, cutting up the b/s chicken and putting it all together in the skillet.  I even added some more honey and a bit of orange rind for some extra flavor.  I served it over rice but it was lacking.  My husband didn't mind it but next time I would simply look for a more "orange chicken" recipe with more flavor.

EVERYBODY LOVED IT! EVEN MY ONE YEAR OLD. I FOLLOWED THE RECIPE EXACTLY HOW IT SAID IN THE INGREDIENTS. BUT SINCE I DIDN'T HAVE MY OVEN READY TO USE SINCE WE ARE REMODELING I JUST FRIED IT. AND IT CAN OUT GREAT. REALLY JUICE. I PUT IN THE USE THAT I USED TO MARINATE IT.

I might make this again, but it would definitely need some tweaking.  It was very salty and the bake time was too long.  Around an hour and 20 minutes in I started smelling a burning smell and the chicken was dried out and the sauce was stuck to the dish.  Otherwise the flavor would have been good, so I'll have to think about trying it again and doing a few things differently, maybe just something as simple as baking it covered instead of uncovered.

My husband says this is a keeper!  I actually used apricot jam and nectar instead of OJ and added a 1/4 cup of rum, and 1/2 teaspoon of crushed red pepper, marinated it overnight and only baked for 1 hour and it turned out really, really good. I will try it with OJ next time but apricots were awesome too.

This recipe was very tasty, I doubled the recipe so there would be lots of sauce. The sauce went great over rice. I used skinless drumsticks and thighs. (about 10-12 pieces) MMMMMM!!
Would also be great to use on chicken wings!

It's good! It made the chicken nice and juicy. I tasted more garlic then the honey or orange. I was hoping for more of a sweet tast so net time I make it I might add more of the honey and less garlic.

I doubled the sauce so that it would be juicy and it worked, I used chicken breast over white rice and it was perfect!! Over all it was really good, I would recommend it for people who like Chinese food, because the soy sauce and orange is what you taste the most!!

I made this today and thought it was good.  I used boneless chicken instead of the whole chicken.  It had a nice flavor and was tender.  I was hungry so I only let it marinate for 45 mins, but it still came out good.  I will make this again.

This was awesome!!! I will totally make this again.  My boyfriend and I had no complaints. I made the marinade per the recipe, but I marinated 5 chicken tenderloinms in ziplock bags for about an hour, then cooked them in the oven for 60 minutes. Super yummy!!!!

SO EASY and absolutely delicious! I had eight people over for dinner last minute and all the ingredients were things I had handy. Great marinade for grilling as well. I've made it twice since then and everyone I've made it for has asked me for the recipe. A must try!

This recipe is so good and tasty. I will so be using it again. My hard to please husband who never gives out compliments was telling me how good it was and that I have to make it again.  I love the orange flavor that comes from the marmalade. Definetly add 1/4 cup of the stuff. The oregano might seem like a lot when your mixing it together but believe me it's not.  The finish product is wonderful.

This was good, but I agree with others that it needs more of an orange flavor. Next time I will use suggestions on putting in some orange marmalade. I used chicken tenderloins with this because it's all we had on hand. Thanx for sharing the recipe!

This is a great recipe.  I tripled the marinade and used orange juice concentrate instead of OJ to give it more intensity.  Next time I will let it marinade over night.  Spooned some of the extra sauce from the baking dish over the rice.  Mmmm!

Very good recipe.  I used pork instead of chix.  I made the sauce days before and placed pork in over night.  the only porblem i had was it was to long in oven.  next time will cook less time.  However, still had great flavor and my husband enjoyed and said ok to make again.

Very good.  I marinated the chicken overnight and then cooked on my George Foreman grill.  I saved the extra marinade, boiled it and added a bit of flour to thicken and used this sauce for the rice I served.  As well, I made garlic broccoli and buttery carrots.  Husband really enjoyed his dinner!

I had to double the marinade ingrediants. The original did not make enough. It had a good flavor but not excellent. Might make again.

My husband and I liked this recipe, although the orange juice was a little overpowring.  I would probably add less of that and more soy next time.  We used only chicken breasts cut up into strips and marinaded for about 5 hours.  The marinade really made the chicken tender and therefore we will definately try this recipe again.

The sauce in this recipe burned before the chicken was finished. We won't be eating this again.

I also doubled this recipe and it turned out wonderful! I used an extra Tbsp. honey and a little less OJ. A nice change from traditional chicken recipes.

It was pretty good.  Make sure that if you are using chicken breasts to use a digital probe thermometer to get the cooking time right.  For me it was only about 20-30min.  Came out nice and juicy - good flavor!

I used chicken breasts instead of the whole chicken and they worked out just fine.
