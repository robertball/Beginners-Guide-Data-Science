Why not use Italian dressing rather than a bunch of complicated ingredients and spices.  Thanks for the SIMPLE version of a great summer picnic side-dish.

Delicious and not overly sweet-good for you, too!  A nice variation to add color would be to use red onion instead of white onion.   Great use for all those homegrown beans!  Simple, easy recipe using ingredients most of us have in our kitchens.  I uploaded the first photo!  Thanks for the great recipe!  Kathy Hill

My husband loves three bean salad and wouldn't come near it.  He then begged me to stop marinating "everything" in Italian dressing.
