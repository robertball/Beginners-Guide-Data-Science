I've been making a variation of this for years. My recipe calls for 1/4 cup of dry mustard and only 5 oz. of horseradish and it has quite a bite so I wouldn't use the 8 oz. of horseradish called for in this recipe unless you want it VERY hot. Update: Try this as a sauce with pork tenderloin or roasted chicken.

This is definetly different!  I will make again, but with theses changes.  First off cut this recipe in 1/2!  I mixed it in with the cream cheese (as opposed to drizzling over) and started with 2oz of horseradish, I also added minced sweet red peppers for texture and color.  I made it the night before to let all the flavors come together and served with tortilla chips, all of my guests raved about this and it was gone in a hour.  I think next time I will add a tbsp of strawberry preserves for a different flavor.  Enjoy!

My husband was nervous about me making this for our party.  Ended up being his favorite thing!  I eased up on the horseradish a bit - Excellent! It's a keeper!!!

This is, most often, a happy suprise to anyone who tries it!  Pineapple preserves are hard to find, but I took the suggestion of other reviewers, and used pineapple ice cream topping.  However, I did find that the topping was more liquid than most preserves, and adjusted accordingly.

Ooh, this is hot. If you think that the fruit spreads will mask the horseradish, I have a bridge you might be interested in buying. I'm not particularly fond of horseradish, but my Dad is, and he looves this, especially with the cream cheese. This recipe also makes an incredible amount, filling a 28 ounce spaghetti sauce jar to the top. Easy storage! This might stick around till next Christmas....

I served this at a Thanksgiving gathering and everyone raved over it.  I absolutely love this recipe.  It is SO simple to prepare.  I found all of the ingredients with no problem at my local Kroger.  VERY easy and VERY delicious.  Awesome!

This is tasty stuff. A local deli here in Charlotte (NC) serves this on their "Turkey Jezebel" sandwich-- mmmm! Very good as a spread with turkey, swiss or provolone, on some good deli bread. Definitely a little strange, but highly recommended!

Yum, yum, yum! I made this for a meeting and I brought celery as well as crackers. Not many people were willing to try it because I didn't make it look very appetizing (had it in plastic containers) but the few who did raved about it. Great combination and the suggestion about adding Chinese hot mustard instead of Dijon sounds like it would be good too if you like more heat.

This recipe is also delicious as a dipping sauce for broiled scallops wrapped with bacon.  I adjusted the recipe slightly by using 3/4 cup horseradish, 2 T. Dijon mustard, ad 2 T. lemon juice. As other reviewers have pointed out, it makes a lot of sauce, but if you get creative, you can find lots of uses or it!  Great recipe.

Loved it.  I bumped up the quanities, brought everything to a low boil, then canned and processed for gifting.  Held up beautifully.  Looks gorgeous in the jar.  And my is it ever tasty.  Used it as a dipping sauce for chicken and with ham slices.  Great!   Will make again and again!

This is great!  Sweet and spicy hot!! Will certainly cure what ails you! It makes your eyes water and your nose run. The only thing I did differently was to gently heat everything together before refrigerating before use.  A KEEPER!

I have made this recipe for years. Everyone just loves it.  I pour the sauce over softened cream cheese then just spread on crackers. I keeps forever in refrig.  You can also use Pepper Jelly in place of Apple and Appricot preserves instead of Pinapple. Almost any combination is great!

AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!  Years ago I worked at Shoney's in Nashville.  They had a Hawaiian chicken dinner on the menu that had this sauce over it.  We would buy it from Shoney's to have at home with our chicken!  Sooooooo stinkin' good!  This has to be the closest thing to their sauce!  I've been making this for ages now and it is fabulous!  Great over cream cheese served with crackers, too!

I make a version of this, but this recipe is in totally the wrong proportions.  In my version I use a 10 oz. jar of apricot preserves, 2 oz. horseradish (not the creamy kind), 1 tsp. ground dry mustard, & 2 tsp. ground black pepper.  Mix together and pour over an 8 oz. block of cream cheese.

I tried this before I knew what was in it.  Had I ever seen the recipe, I would have thought it would be horrible!  So if you're doubting whether or not this will be good, take it from a picky eater....it is SOOOO addictive!!!  It's just the right combination of sweet, sour and spicy.

Excellent! Rave reviews from the family. Halved the recipe and poured over softened cream cheese. Great combo of hot and sweet. Added a bit of red pepper flakes for appearance. Regular party dip from now on.

This is absolutely wonderful. My mother just found this recipe in a cookbook, and that one lady shouldn't have thrown it out. The cookbook said it can keep in the fridge FOREVER...we just pour a little on a block of creamcheese, and i live alone so i just slice as much cream cheese as i will eat that day, and put a little sauce on top, then dip the cracker in it.  DO NOT SUBSTITE FOR FAT FREE AND LOW FAT CREAM CHEESE. I am alway baffled when people on here alter recipes before they try them following the exact directions.

This is a yummy dip!  I used half the suggested amount of horseradish and it is still has a good amount of heat.  If you are having trouble finding pineapple preserves, check the ice cream topping isle in your grocery store.  That is where I found pineapple topping/jam that works great!

Made this for a friends baby shower, it turned out great!  I can't get pineapple preserves here so I used a can of crushed pineapple...  I didn't get enough liquid drained out of it, so it was a little too juicy for my taste....also I used an entire can of crushed pineapple and an entire jar of apple jelly and only 4 oz of horseradish and it was a little too spicy for some of the people at the shower.  Over all this is a fantastic Recipe and it will be on my list of party foods forever!

I admit, I was really nervous putting all that horseradish in this recipe - so I probably used 3/4 of what recipe called for. As others have noted, it does make a LOT - so I would halve the recipe next time. It was a big hit with my guests - do make sure to let it sit overnight for the flavors to 'meld.'  Will definitely serve this again.

Had dinner guest last night and they went crazy over this, I served it over cream cheese and had an assortment of crackers to go with it. I forgot that it is suppose to be made 8 hrs before serving but made it anyway, about 2 hrs before serving and very good. It's Mothers Day today and we have a family get together I'm taking some to serve as a spread for Ham. It is a strange mix but well worth the surprise taste.

We did not enjoy this one at all!  I only used 1/4 or 1/2 of the horseradish but it completely overwhelmed the flavors of the jelly and preserves.  It was very hot too.  We tried it over cream cheese with crackers but it was still unbearably strong.  Very disappointing and a waste of lots of jelly.  Only make this one if you know that you really, really love horseradish, or start out with only a couple tablespoons of horseradish and taste it before adding more.

I've also been making this for years, but I don't add cracked pepper, and instead of pineapple jelly/jam, I use a apricot-pineapple jelly/jam. Most people love it! I serve with either ritz crackers or wheat thins.

A long-time favorite recipe.  Save your best small jars and refrigerate any remaining sauce.  It keeps well for many months!  I try to keep it on hand for unexpected company or to give as a small gift.

This was a great addition to a wedding reception!  Had a hard time finding pineapple preservers so substituted apricot pineapple jam and it worked fine!  You may want to halve this recipe because it makes a ton -- I had enough sauce for 2 plates of spread!

I've made this for years but I use apricot preserves instead of the apple jelly and I don't add the dry mustard.  This is fantastic served over grilled pork tenderloin.  Guests inevitably request the recipe.

I've used this recipe several times but forgot to review it in the past. I love it. I don't use an entire jar of horseradish however do add cayenne. I combine half the sauce with 8 oz. softened cream cheese, chill and serve with crackers.  Everyone asks for the recipe!

I would like to give this 5 stars but I made it exactly as written and took a taste. It about blew the top of my head off, and believe me, I like hot & spicy foods. I added more pineapple preserves and apple jelly to make it edible. I plan to serve it with our Easter ham tomorrow and am looking forward to serving it atop a block of cream chese later.

I've been making this for years.  I actually put a whole bar of cream cheese on a plate and pour the sauce over it.  People typically respond cautiously at first (It doesn't look as yummy as it tastes), but then once tried, it's the first thing gone and everyone wants the recipe.  A perfect blend of sweet and spicy!

Served over softened cream cheese with crackers. Friends raved. I did add fresh ground pepper. It was very good. I'll make some at Christmas for gifts.

I used 1/2 of the horseradish as called for and added 1/8 tsp crushed red pepper for appearance sake. It still had a kick but was mild enough that everyone enjoyed it. It makes plenty and should keep in the fridge same as jelly will. I can think of many things this sauce will compliment. This recipe is a winner!

I have had this in the past. It was called jezebel dip, because we poured the sauce over a block of cream cheese and served with a good water cracker. Excellent!!!! sweet and spicy.

This stuff is wonderful-have passed on the recipe to many, many people!!  Only thing to change is the amount of horseradish-decrease by 1/2 to start, then add more to taste (8 oz is VERY hot)

I have been making Jezebel sauce for years and love it with pork tenderloin or over cream cheese.  However, this recipe calls for twice as much as I normally use...I would recommend using 4oz instead.

This is similar to a sauce I make to put over cream cheese that uses apricot and pineapple preserves, hot pepper sauce and crushed red peppers.  It's very festive looking with the red pepper flakes glistening like small red jewels in the sauce.

I use a can of cranberry sauce with cranberries in place of the apple jelly, and reduce the horseradish to 4-5 oz, and use this as my ham glaze for the holidays.  It is a hit!! This is also good with cream cheese.

This was so good.  Spicy though.  I have family who are not blessed with the cast iron stomach I have.  So maybe a lil less on the horseradish next time.

I have made a variation of this using apricot preserves and less horseradish. Adjust it to your own tastes. It is great on roast beef, pork, ham and chicken. Since being diabetic I now use sugar free preserves and jelly. Friends and family haven't a clue it is now sugar free when I gift it to them.

We use this as a dipping sauce for Mahi Mahi, chicken strips, and mozzarella sticks. It is also good as a glaze on ham or pork loin. I've never added the black pepper though, the taste without it is too good to mess with!

This has become a Thanksgiving tradition for our family.  It's become a staple next to Aunt Glynda's greenbean casserole &  Grandmother's dressing. Quite an honor. Almost makes you feel guilty because it's so easy to make!

My family has been making Jezebel sauce for longer than I can remember and it has Always been a huge hit. I had to substitute the  pineapple preserves for peach because my store only had sugar-free...it turned out So Yummy! I spread the cream cheese in a Christmas tree shaped platter ad drizzled the sauce like garland..looked cute.

As others have noted, way, way too much horseradish. I (silly me) put the whole honkin' jar of the stuff in without slowly tasting it as I went along and pretty much destroyed the batch.

The sauce was very good.  I made the full recipe and then stirred about 1/2 the sauce into softened cream cheese.  I served this for a tennis outing and it stood up nicely to being outside for a good amount of time.  Was well recieved by everyone

I followed the recipe to a T. I served this over cream cheese at a small gathering at my house. Most people were scared of it, not knowing what it was so they wouldn't try it. I tried it without the cheese and it had a completely different taste. The cream cheese really sets it off! It is a different mix of flavors that is a nice change. The recipe made ALOT. Next time I will downsize the recipe and serve it to a more adventurous crowd. Thanks for sharing!
