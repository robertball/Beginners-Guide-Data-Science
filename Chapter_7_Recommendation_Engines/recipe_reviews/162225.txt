I thought this was pretty good.  I have made it twice and found that the bleu cheese was too powerful a cheese for turnip and strong rosemary the first time.  So.. I made it again and subbed parmesan to the cooked recipe and left the bleu cheese to be added after- as a topping.  I also made it without mushrooms since I was out (the second time) and did not miss them.  I sprinkiled the herbs on the top just before baking

This was good.  I however changed it a bit...I took out the rosemary all together, used havarti cheese in place of Gruyere and used Zuccini in place of leeks.  I also minused the mushrooms all together.  When I layered it I salted and peppered and put havarti cheese between each layer.  It turned out really good and had a nice flavor.  I also left the thyme leaves in the cream mixture. It is an easy recipe to play around with.

It seems to have all the right stuff, but somehow should have tasted better.

4.22.17   Sorry, but this recipe is confusing, not well written.  It doesn’t tell you to insert a steamer insert/basket in the pan, but instructs you to put the veggies in the pot, cover with 1” of water, bring to a boil, and “steam.”  Basically, what you’re doing is parboiling the veggies.  It tells you to bake “uncovered” for about 40 minutes, then “uncover” for the last 20 minutes...maybe a typo???  So here’s what I did.  First, I sliced (not cubed) the butternut squash 1/4” thick and cut the slices in half, the same as the other veggies, for uniform cooking.  I baked the casserole “covered” for 20 minutes and then “uncovered” for 20 minutes.  As other reviewers have commented, I felt the blue cheese dominated the flavor, and I’d reduce that by at least half or leave it out completely (and I love blue cheese)  and double or more the gruyere (now that cheese was good on this!).  The turnips, butternut squash, carrots and the leek all work harmoniously, however, I felt the mushrooms didn’t belong in this gratin, they didn’t even look appealing after baking, and I'd eliminate them.  This was OK, but not as tasty as I’d hoped, so a bit of a disappointment.

This was pretty darn good, but I wish I hadn't added the squash. I didn't like the sweet with the rest of the dish.
