This was a nice change of pace from the 2-3 pork roast recipes I usually make. The herb mixture is quite tasty. I almost left the ginger out, because I'm not a big fan of ground ginger, but I'm glad I left it in. Very simple to prepare, but full of flavor.  My roast was about 2.5lbs, and even though it was smaller than stated in the ingredients, I still cooked it the full 4 hours. It was perfectly juicy and tender. Next time I will leave out the honey since I prefer my meat not to have any sweetness to it. I served this with "creamy mashed sweet potatoes" and "apple-pear sauce" which can be found on this site. Thank you wally_C for sharing your recipe! I look forward to having leftovers for lunch this week.

I used this for my very first pork roast and it came out great! It's so easy with very few ingredients, that it would be tough to screw it up,,,so perfect for me. My roast was about 4 1\4 lbs, so I kept it in for 4 1\2 hours. It came out exactly like the picture, moist and delicious.

This was very tender, very savory and tasty. Will definitely make it again. I substituted apple cider for the wine as there was a person who doesn’t do alcohol and it was wonderful.  Took it to a holiday party and it had rave reviews.

This recipe is awesome! I doubled the rub ingredients, used chicken broth instead of white wine and cooked it in the slow cooker  at low for 5 hours. It was fork tender and delicious!

This is simple to make and a real welcome change from the usual marinades that I use with pork (often using soy sauce, ginger, garlic, honey and/or mustard) . I didn't have time to add the wine and put it in the slow cooker, so I made the rub, drizzled a tiny amount of honey over the meat, and threw it in the oven. Tasty!

Pork Roast with Herb Rub Haiku: "Slow-cooked mine on low, til that sucker fell apart. Pure Pork Perfection!!" I used a 7 lb pork butt instead of a roast, so after trimming as much fat as I could, I wedged it in the slow cooker w/ some onions around it. (I also rubbed it down the day b4, wrapping it tightly in saran wrap.) 8 hrs. on low and one poke resulted in delectable pork, falling apart w/ flavorful goodness, no BBQ sauce required. Just ate it in chunks alongside a salad.

Recipe was very good,  I substituted fresh garlic for the garlic salt.   It came out moist the first time but needs gravy for the leftovers since it tends to dry out.  But definitely a keeper!

The seasoning of the pork made the slow cooking of this meat mouth watering.  It was so tender it broke apart with a fork.  Speaking of which I had enough left over for pulled pork sandwiches on another night and that was delicious too.

Very tasty!  Husband and five boys don’t like it when I get “fancy” or “complicate” foods.  The seasoning mixture was spot on.  Gave the food flavor while still tasting simple.  Crowd pleaser for mom and boys.  Will be making again!

I made it as per the recipe,  minus the pepper.  I'd use less seasoning the next time.  Served with Mc Cormack pork gravy.

Doubled the rub for a 3.5 lbs roast. Cooked for 8 hrs on low. Turned out great. Made a pan gravy with the juices also great. Will be adding to the regular rotation. Will most likely rub the day before and marinate overnight the next time, should be even better.

The meat was very tender and tasty.  I changed the quantities of spice and herbs as the roast I had was just over 1 lb.

This was OK.  I cooked it on low for 6 hours, but then it was probably on warm for another 3 hours.  It's difficult to make crock pot dishes that don't need to cook all day when you're at work!  So, mine was a bit dry.  Also, not super flavorful.  I thought the rub would be pretty amazing, but maybe because it got so dry it didn't really lend any taste.  Couldn't taste the honey at all.

This was the most yummy pork roast I have ever eaten. The only thing I changed was that I cooked it on low for seven hours as I couldn't be around to let it cook on high. I also used a small amount of sugar as the honey jar is empty.

Turned out to have good flavor but pretty tough. Maybe it was just the cut, but next time I'll probably marinate it overnight in a cola to tenderize it.

This was an excellent roast and could be made on low heat if you need to leave it for a longer period.  The only substitution I made was for the white wine, which I replaced with chicken broth (I have never liked the taste of wine).  This was super-easy and came out delicious and tender... what more could you want?

It was great with the different spices, I cut back on the ginger for personal reasons. Cooked it on low overnight and it fell apart :-) Great recipe.

We really liked it and we had enough left over to have sandwiches.
