Had something like this at a Mexican Taco stand! They were rolled and the potatoe mixture had green onions and cilantro added and deep fried.

I'm not sure why these got such a low rating.  Obviously you can't expect gourmet food going into a recipe with instant mashed potatoes.  For what these were, a simple lunch, they were great.  Yummy little things these were and I will continue to make them!

I don't care for this recipe but my husband LOVES them.  We're vegetarian and he thinks they make a great dinner or after work snack.  I have to admit that the combination of flavors is a lot better than I would have thought.

This was fantastic, but you MUST double the cheese, sour cream and the french fried onions or it will be too bland. Once I did that it was absolutely excellent. Everyone from my mom to my 5 year old loved it.

I had some leftover mashed potatoes and searched for a way to use them up.  Tasted more like taco sauce on a baked potato than anything else.

This was delicious but I used real mashed potatoes I had left over.  I don't care for boxed mashed potatoes.  Jazzed it up with more sour cream and cheese and chopped green onion.  Low cost meal and a great way to use up  leftover  mashed potatoes.

This has a lot of potential to be a great vegetarian meal however as written it was rather bland. If I made it again I would add some taco seasoning, jalapenos & fresh chopped tomato to the potato.

These are sold in the streets in Mexico. I make this my own by using my favorite taco toppings or add chopped green chiles, sauteed onions and garlic for a 'chiles rellenos' flavor.  Use garlic mashed potatoes, add corn, taco seasoning, whatever. To make it lower in fat, I omit the butter, use lo-fat cheese and sub lo-fat yogurt for the sour cream.

This is great for what it is...a quick, easy meal.  I don't know what others were expecting, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I did add extra cheese and some taco seasoning to boost the flavor.  I think it would even be good with some sauteed spinach to add some nutritional value!

Well I admit I thought it sounded really unappealing when I first read it but the kids wanted to try it.  They loved it and have requested it again "really, really , soon" so I guess its a keeper.  We did leave of the fried onions because they don't care for them.  My husband felt like they were missing something though even though we added chopped onion to his since he likes onion. We will be having these again.

I don't know what to make of this. It was interesting, but I don't think it's a repeat recipe. I left out the french-fried onions (didn't have any on hand). It was fun to try something different, thanks GUNNEAU.

I submitted this recipe a few years ago & I think the variations you guys suggested are awesome! However my children go for the bland, so after I serve them I pile on all the exras for me. Yummy!

Creative- yes.  Worth the effort and the mess- no.  I found this recipe to be bland and very messy for my child.  In order for it to have any taste at all, I'd say one would need to add more seasonings, perhaps some fresh tomatoes, and maybe some garlic.

This is a great idea - I've had mashed potato tacos in the past, the first time in college, when my boyfriend (who was from Mexico) brought me some that his mom had made (he told you could make anything into a taco), and the next time at my favorite Costa Rican restaurant, in one of their tastiest vegan dishes! I can't bring myself to use instant mashed potatoes, so I used leftovers. I also don't care for hard shells, so I use soft corn tortillas, and crisp them a bit in a non-stick pan with a little oil. They can use more zesty spices, I like to use dried red chile powder from New Mexico, and top them with cilantro (no cheese on my tacos, thank you). I think it's a good base to start from and tweak to your own tastes, and a great idea for anyone that's never thought of potato in tacos!

it's better if you fry your own taco shells either taco or tostada style. make home made mashed potatos, add grilled corn, salt, pepper, cheese and these are fab. you can always add meats if you want to make more of a meal. and butter makes everything better!!

I tried this twice.  First time.. way too boring.  The second time I doubled cheese, onion, and sour cream and used real potatoes(that need to be eaten).  I also added taco seasoning(the plus) and it was awesome!

I made these but used cooked diced potatoes. Added shredded cabbage and seasoned with taco seasoning. Followed up with salsa and shredded cheese.  My family loves them, a great change from using mystery hamburger meat!

5 out of 5 stars for sure!!  I enjoy trying "weird" recipes, and today we were well rewarded.  As per other reviewers, I added seasonings (1/2 tsp each: cumin, corriander, garlic powder, and onion powder) directly into the potatoes. I also added 1/2 can black beans for some protein, and in my opinion these tacos are good with or without them depending on your bean preference.  This will be one of our new favorites!!

great, easier spin on tacos de papa. i still use regular corn tortillas instead of the boxed kind, but add some sauteed garlic and onions, and these are delicious.

I prefer to fry my own tortillas with this recipe.  I buy the smaller corn tortillas.  I first dip the tortillas in the hot oil and add the mashed potatoes.  I then place them back in the oil and fry them up until golden brown...a DEFINITE favorite of the entire family!
