I've seen this recipe before, called "Texas Two-Step Chicken."  I've made it many times, and my kids always love it.  My suggestion is to place the chicken in a crock pot, mix the sauce ingredients, pour over the chicken and cook on low for 4-6 hours. Yummy!

This is a favorite in our house - we often top with shredded cheddar for the last 10 minutes of baking time. Yummy!

For many years I have made something similar to this with just putting boneless, skinless chicken breasts and a large bottle of Pace Picante sauce and putting it in the crock pot all day.  The chicken is so tender it just falls apart.  I aways serve it over rice or noodles.  So easy and tastes great!

We love this chicken. Several years ago I saw this recipe on the back of a jar of picante sauce and I've been making it ever since. It is easy to make and tasty with rice or without. I served it to my sister and she asked for the recipe and she makes it often too.

Excellent recipe.  Even my dh, who isn't fond of chicken, liked it. I used mild salsa and think next time I'll use at least half medium.  The brown sugar off sets the pepper and it could have used a bit more spice.

I cooked this chicken for over an hour and it never got up to 180 degrees. I don't know what happened, but my fiance and I never got to eat it!

Pretty good but I changed it a bit.  I added one small can of green chilies and a can of cheese soup to all of these ingredients and put it in the crock pot for 5 hours.  Turned out great and served over egg noodles.

It was a hit with my boyfriend who likes things on a spicier side - I used the hot Picante Sauce. The only thing is that the recipe doesn't say whether to cover the baking dish or not. i would say 50/50 - bake half of the time cover then cover otherwise the dish will be a bit too watery.

Took another reviewer suggestion and just put the chicken into a crock pot, poured the sauce over it and cooked for about 5 hours.  Very good and very easy.  Served it with Spanish rice.  This is a keeper.

This is so easy it is one of my quick meals I make after coming home from work later.  I also have 3 jars of mustard (don't ask) so I am always looking for good recipes that include mustard.

I used frozen boneless, skinless chicken breasts, placed them in a crockpot, mixed the sauce ingredients, using my own homemade salsa, and poured it over the chicken. Cooked on low 8 hours. It was moist and delicious. I plan on using the leftover chicken in enchiladas.

This was so delicious.  I used a medium salsa so it was a little spicy for the kids, next time I will use mild.  The flavor was perfect spicy, sweet, YUMM!!  My husband who doesn't really like to eat chicken and usually will only eat half a breast went back and got the rest.  He also said, "You could make that again".  That is really saying something!!

What an easy, tasty recipe!  I made this last night for the first time, and my husband and I just loved it!  I followed the recipe, only sprinkling salt and pepper on the chicken breasts before pouring the salsa mixture over the top.  You can taste the dijon and the brown sugar, but neither of them is overwhelming at all.  They just add a wonderful richness to the salsa.  So glad I tried it, and I know I will be making it again and again.  Thanks for such an easy and delicious recipe!

I make a version of this quite often.   I dredge my chicken in flour and brown it in a very small amount of oil.   I pour the picante sauce over it and add a little water and let it simmer until the chicken is tender.   I also add salt and pepper or a seasoning salt.  May have to try this version and see if my son likes it.

I have to admit that I was skeptical about these flavors mixed together.  But, I prepared it as the recipe directed and it was a HUGE success!!  It really was delicious and my husband said I could do this any time I want.  It will definitely be a regular on our menu list.  LOVE IT....Thanks.

YUMMY yummi YUMMY!!!! i made this chicken for supper tonight & my hubby had a fit. He loved it! I thought it was a tad too sweet, but that's the reason my husband like it so much. It has a great flavor! It's spicy & sweet...the fllavors are amazing:) I used the picante sauce; the only thing i wasn't so crazy about was the thinness of the sauce. Picante sause is not as thick as salsa and i could tell while eatcing this chicken. However, overall, this chicken was amazing! We will def. be adding this to one of our regular meals...

My husband and I really enjoyed the recipe and will make it again. Considering he is not a chicken fan this is saying a lot. The one problem I had was the cooking time. I will make sure I make the chicken breast thinner,as it took almost an hour to cook to 180.

I too make this in my slow cooker. Low 5-6 hours. Steamed rice on the side with fresh tomatoes & avocado. You can even shred the chicken for quick tacos! Easy weeknight meal.
