I followed this recipe to the letter, and it tasted wonderful!  A great balance of the sweet and spices, with a smooth texture.

A note, to cook the squash, I put it in the microwave for about 3-4 mins so it was easier to cut in half. I removed the seeds, then put on a baking sheet with some foil over it, then baked in the oven on 350 for about 40 mins; then I let it cool before scooping out with my measuring cup. 
So with that in mind, I would add about an hour to the prep time if you are using fresh butternut squash.

This pie is delicious.  I always bake butternut squash and not boil it for more flavor.  Also, I normally interchange pumpkin and butternut squash in recipes because I grow so much butternut squash in my garden.  Any leftover butternut squash from meal time is made into pies or muffins the next day.   This is a great use of any leftover butternut squash.

I was looking for a creative way to use half of a roasted butternut squash, when I came upon this recipe! I was a little skeptical and so was my hubby, but the pie turned out excellent! It tastes very very similar to pumpkin pie. One note, I thought I could 'blend' all of the ingredients in my stand mixer, but ended up having to put all into my blender to get the texture right. Thank you for sharing this great recipe!

Followed the recipe to a tee. Came out great, light and fluffy. We couldn't stop eating it.

This is an awesome pie! I've made lots of different pumpkin pie recipes over the years and I may be bidding them adieu after trying this butternut squash pie. The nutty taste of the squash and adding more nutmeg and ginger than the typical pumpkin pie recipes make this a very distinctive and delicious pie. Also, I have never added vanilla extract to these types of pies and it really seems to enhance all of the other ingredients. Thank you Blaze and your grandmother up north.

I made this without a crust. It was made with spaghetti squash and acorn.

I didnâ€™t have milk, evaporated milk, or whipping cream, but I had squash that needed to get used up so I substituted coconut milk and it was very good!  Per my own taste I went a little light on each of the spices. I have already made this pie a second time.

I made it just like the recipe, it was great.  Would defineately make again.  Next time I might cut the spices down a bit. 
But it had great flavor, better than pumpkin.

The family loved this 'pumpkin pie'.  ;)  
It is really sweet, at least for me, nobody else thought it was too sweet.  Very light with a delicate texture.   So easy to make in the blender.   I made it without any changes except baking time.  I had to tent with foil and add 10 minutes.  
Considering I have a boat load of butternut growing in the garden, I will keep this recipe for future reference.
