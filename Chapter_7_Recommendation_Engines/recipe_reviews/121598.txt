This is super yumo!  I used a  yellow cake mix with white chocolate chips the first time I made it and a red velvet mix with white chips the next. They were both awesome. There are endless possiblites with this recipe. Whatever flavors you like together will work.

Most of the high reviews are from people who didn't even follow the original recipe.  The cake part is soft & moist, but tastes really weird and kind of gross.  I'm not a big fan of white cake, so that may be why I didn't like it.  I understand why one reviewer couldn't serve these to guests.

They're as good as they are easy to make!  I sprinkled toffee bits on top before baking and they turned out GREAT!!!  I do recommend waiting until they cool to cut them as they are somewhat soft when they first come out of the oven.

These were a HUGE hit.  I almost didn't get one because everyone was taking 2 or 3.  Next time, I'll make a double batch!  They're certainly easy enough!  I agree that they would probably be good with other flavor combos...I'm thinking carrot cake & cinnamon chips??  or how about chocolate cake mix & peanut butter chips??  The possiblities are endless!

This turned out very good.  I love it because it is so flexible.  You can use any flavor cake mix.  You can use butter in place of oil.  You can use any type of gooey center (Chocolate, peanut-butter, mint chips, toffee, etc.)  This recipe is simple and very tasty.

Very rich and gooey!  It would be fun to experiment with different flavors of cake mix and/or chips.
5-19-12:  I made these with devil's food cake mix and butterscotch chips.  OH MY!  I don't think they were left in long enough because they were SO gooey that it was a challange to eat them without a fork.  But they were still heavenly!

I think this is the worst recipe I have made from allrecipes.com.  These were beyond bad.  Even my husband (who eats anything) thought they were terrible.  I followed directions perfectly.  I was looking for a quick and easy dessert for a dinner with my in-laws.  I was unable to serve these as they were so bad. Sorry!

Hey, I tried submitting this recipe! No wonder mine has sat in review for a year! LOL :) This recipe is so good, have been making it for years.  Versatile too, you can use chocolate cake mix and butterscotch chips for something different.

These are easy and everyone loves them.  Personally, I think they are a bit too sweet/rich.  I used Cocoa Powder instead of the chocolate chips, which seemed to help.

I'm sorry, these were just not good.  I gave it 3 stars for how easy they were to make.  Even my family hasn't really touched them and that tells me something.

I made this recipe as written by the submitter and found it to be tasty, but a bit boring.  I think other flavor combos would be excellent, like others have suggested, such as yellow cake mix and chocolate, chocolate cake and peanut butter chips, or chocolate cake and mint chips.

I used a German Chocolate cake mix and mint chocolate chips. I LOVED these bars with the gooey chocolate layer.  They were different and so delicious! I wasn't sure the chocolate layer was going to set up, but it turned out just fine.  I baked them 25 minutes.

Great recipe, and truly very simple.  Other variations that are good to use also are chocolate cake mix with peanut butter chips and/or butterscotch chips.  This recipe is very versatile.  I want to try mint chips sometime too!

This is an exceptional recipe, particularly for 'pot-luck' gatherings.  After finding the recipe in a magazine, I have been making it for 6 years.  I took it to a party over this past weekend, and had to act fast to get a little for myself before it disappeared.  One man called it "Toll House cookies on steroids" before he took a piece to his father, saying 'Dad, you HAVE to try this.'    Over time, I have made some modifications to the recipe.  After microwaving and completely stirring the melted chocolate chip mixture, I add at least 1/2 Tablespoon of vanilla and 1/3 to 1/2 cup of chopped nuts.  It makes the taste even better.  Enjoy!

These were very easy.  I used butter cake mix and added a little bit of toffee bits to the top.  They were really good.

I have now made this three times.  Easy and fast to make.  One time I used a chocolate cake mix and mint chips.  Turned out great.  Will be making these bars again.

One of the easier and best desserts I've made yet. I plan to serve them to in the teacher's room at school. today. Hope my coworkers like them as much as I do. I was worried that they wouldn't seem bar like since I was using cake mix but they were perfect. I'd be interested in forgetting about putting on the dots of dough and adding chopped nuts to the top. I love the consistency of the chocolate and although I cooked my milk too long and had to use a whisk to fix the sepaaration problem they still came out alright. I used fat free sweetened condensed and you couldn't tell.

I made 2 of these for a church pot luck.  I made one with yellow cake mix and chocolate chips and I made one with chocolate cake mix and peanut butter chips.  No one liked the taste of the yellow with chocolate chips but I got tons of compliments on the chocolate cake mix and peanut butter chips.  I will make the chocolate version again but not the yellow.

I made these for our Girls Night Out in June.  Very easy to make and they set up nicely.  The girls loved them and I came home with an empty pan.  I think that is a great compliment to this recipe.  I would make these again.

My family actually loved these. Great served warm with vanilla ice cream on top.Or, To jazz up the recipe  i used a touch of vanilla in the cake mix dough, spread strawberry jam (any jam would work) on  the crust then i used half peanut butter chips / half chocolate chips. This was super tasty and way less boring. :D

I used yellow cake instead of white.  This was not as easy to make as I thought it would be.  The kids said it tasted like chocolate chip cookies they liked it but it wasn't special at all. Not worth the work.

3 for taste, 5 for ease.  This was a very good recipe, but I think it would be much better with a little flavoring (vanilla or coffee liquor) in the chocolate & some crunch (nuts or brickle bits)...maybe even a chocolate cake mix for DH who thinks there's no such thing as too much chocolate :-)

I love this recipe, but I can NEVER get my chocolate to look so brown! It's always very light and the crumbles on top a little too brown. Please tell me what I'm doing wrong:)

this is , by far, one of my favorite recipes.  I take them to all my family get togethers..and make them for a weeknight dessert.  If you do not like these bars, you are doing something wrong, or you just do not love rich chocolate..they are the best!!

I haven't made this exact recipe, but I have made something like it.  In the mix I added 1 cup mini choco chips & 1 cup toffee pieces.  Instead of using chocolate as the "filling", melt together the butter, the milk and 35 peeled caramels!!  Pour on top of the base, spread, top with the rest of the cake mix, and bake....OMG...these you can't leave alone!  Try them, trust me!!

Kids rated this a 5. Mom & dad a 4. Too sweet. It's hard to rate a dessert too sweet but you need a cup of coffee with these.

I followed the recipe exactly as I usually do the first time I try a new recipe. I was vwey pleased with the result. It is a very sweet cookie bar, but then that's the idea, isn't it. The grandchildren certainly gave it 5 stars. Sometime I may try some of the variations suggested but for now I am content with the recipe as written

We found this recipe years ago and have been making it ever since.  We follow the recipe with one exception, we use red velvet cake mix and white chocolate chips.  It is a huge hit in my house.  When we first made it, I didn't read the amount of chocolate correctly and put in way too much.  It never set.  We have fondly called it Goo ever since.

Really good. Simple to make.  Had a French vanilla cake mix and added toffee chips on top like another reviewer suggested.  Smack, smack.

Yummy, easy and fast! Took to a family reunion and everybody wanted the recipe.  The second time I made them I added chopped pecans to the cake mix that went on top.  Also very yummy!

Very delicious! My husband defiantly enjoyed these bars. I would let the cool completely before cutting them as the chocolate tends to stay a little gooey for a while. Yum!

I have made these bars many times over the last several years and they have always been a success. Yes, they are very sweet, but that doesn't bother me.....or anyone else Ive served them too for that matter. Very easy to make and delicious!

I made these bars for a party and everyone raved about them--gave the recipe to most of my guests.  I substituted yellow cake mix because I thought it would be more flavorful.  Really yummy!!

These were super easy and EXTREMELY GOOD!!! I made them yesterday and only have about 4 bars left. I enjoyed the white cake mix with the chocolate, and I think that next time I'll try the peanut butter chips. You might also want to think about having a glass of milk on hand.

Very tasty bars!  We all love them!  I didn't have a cake mix on hand, so I substituted the following:

2 1/3 cups flour
1 tbl baking powder
3/4 tsp salt
1 1/2 cups sugar

Mix dry ingredients then add in the eggs and oil, plus 1 tbl milk and 1 tsp vanilla.  Continue with recipe as stated.  

It turned out great - the cake part was a bit fluffy, so if I have to improvise on the cake mix, I'd add in less baking powder.  But as is, it was a great, chewy, chocolately dessert!  Thumbs up!!

These are really good! I made it with fat-free sweetened condensed milk and yellow cake mix, and you can also substitute peanut butter chips for the chocolate chips.

I wanted to make something fun for desert, and this seemed pretty easy. I didn't have semi-sweet chips, only milk chocolate, it was very sweet, but very good. Luckily my husband and I have a good strong sweet tooth! I added about 1 1/2 Tbl. of water to the cake mix before dividing it up, it was a little too thick I thought. Worked well.

Everytime I make these, someone always asks for the recipe.  For variety, I have used chocolate cake mix with peanut butter chips and it was just as delicious as the original!

I used peanut butter chips instead of chocolate chips, and I suggest sticking with the original recipe.  They were too sweet.
