Used rum extract and freshly grated nutmeg.  And, yes, it really does taste like eggnog.  Served today on Orange Pecan Pie, but this would be an outstanding topping for a pumpkin pie.

This is delicious! I halved the sugar though, bc I didn't want it too sweet. Had cinnamon whiskey on hand so I used 1/2 T of that, and then added a T of actual eggnog. Tastes just like eggnog, and I can put it on my gingerbread cake! I'll follow up after I make the cake and eat them together.
