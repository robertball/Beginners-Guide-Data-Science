This is a great cake.  The only adjustments I would make is to the frosting. I added yellow coloring to the icing. I would increase the frosting to allow for extra to pipe onto the cake to decorate it.  A "crumb layer" is helpful when frosting this cake.  Frost the cake very lightly and pay no attention to all the crumbs that will fall off the cake and mingle in the frosting.  Refrigerate the cake for about a half an hour to let the icing firm up and then remove the cake and finish frosting the cake.....this way the crumbs stay in the first layer and will not ruin the look of the finished cake.

I've made this recipe a number of times and I always get rave reviews!!  I have changed it a little: I have increased the filling ingredients by one-half and I've changed the cake by reducting the milk to 3/4 cup and adding 1/4 cup lemon juice. I love how lemony it is!

For someone that loves lemon everything, I found this recipe to be nothing short of exceptional!  The flavor was so intense!  Because I was in a hurry over the Memorial Day weekend I used a white cake mix but used 2 egg whites and 1 whole egg instead of only the 3 egg whites that the box recipe calls for.  I also used store-bought lemon curd.  I did make the included recipe for the lemon buttercream frosting, which was out of this world!  I will definitely make this cake again and again.  Everyone raved over it, and I was bummed that there were no leftovers!

After reading reviews that many thought this cake was to dense, I substituted cake flour for all purpose flour.  As a result, I didn't find this cake to be dense at all.  It's also very important to not overmix the batter!  Thos two tips should ensure a super light and moist cake.  The filling and icing on this cake just couldn't be beat!!

First, I hate it when people change everything and then rate the recipe either high or low when it is not deserved! Some five star examples were: use a store bought white cake and jared lemon curd and then a five star rating. You are not rating this cake and doing someone counting on the reviews a true dis-service.  The frosting turned out really good but that was it for me. The cake was too dense and the filling was, I can't believe I am saying this, too lemony. I love lemon and was excited about this cake. This was a cake for a baby shower and I was disapointed and I don't think anyone ate their whole piece. I may try again as the reviews are so high but so many people changed it so dramatically that I don't know if I will.

I'm sure this recipe is delicious as written, but I used it for inspiration and here's what I did instead.
I used a box lemon cake mix to make two 8 inch round cakes. Left one cake in tact and cut the other in half for a three layer cake. The uncut cake on the bottom, with lemon curd (purchased) spread over it. Then topped with the second layer of cake, and put a whipped topping & lemon pudding mixute on it.(3 oz pkg instant lemon pudding - prepared. Let it set up for five minutes, then blend about 1/2 container of whipped topping into it.) Then placed the top cake layer on and frosted everything using the lemon cream cheese frosting from this site. Plenty of frosting to add decorative piping. I had people who were completely stuffed from a large meal coming back for seconds of cake! It was fabulous!

this cake was very good. I Did make a few changes when I made it though. For the cake I added Lemon pudding filling and Lemon extract so that The cake itself would have a Lemon extract. My other change was that I used Lemon extract where ever the recipe called for vanilla extract. I also doubled the cake mix so that I was able to fill my pans a little more so that when I cut the layers in half it would be thick enough for the cut. I would suggest to double up on the icing as well. The original recipe makes just enough, but if you are like me and wish to have enough icing to fully cover the cake like I wanted to, then a double batch would be good. I did have a problem with the way that the filling tasted. To me I could still taste the yolk of the eggs, and I didn't like that , so the next time I would prefer buying a Lemon filling for that part of the cake. I will make this cake again!

I wish I would've read the whole recipie before cooking, I didn't give myself enough time to make it, but let me say, it was the best cake I've ever tasted! Absolutely divine! Everyone loved it and I now have it in my "special occasions" folder, if you have the time, I would suggest this one hundred times over!!!!

I 11/2 times the recipe and made it in 9" pans. I had plenty of filling and just enough frosting. Next time I will pipe frosting around the inside edge of the layers with filling. I began with makeing the filling and letting it cool while I baked the cake. I did substitute 1/3 cup of the milk for lemon juice. I  will try more next time. I love lemon and this cake totally took care of my craving. A really wonderful cake!

My rating is for the filling, as that is the only part of the recipe I have used.  The filling is wonderful!  I received rave reviews from my entire family after using this in a plain yellow cake.  It is just the right texture for a cake filling.

I made just the filling and frosting from this recipe, choosing to make the white cake from a box mix.  The filling was oddly tart and sweet at the same time, and the recipe made way too much for an 8-inch round, even using it on two layers.  The frosting was very sweet, too.  The whole cake made my teeth hurt.  There are better lemon cake recipes 'out there.' I won't make this one again.

Delish!!!  My husband is NOT a cake kind of guy.  He is a pie guy...lemon merengue to be specific.  But our 4 year old insisted that Daddy have a cake for his birthday.  So this cake, I thought, might be the best of both worlds.  I was right!  He LOVED it!  

Now, here are some things I might suggest.  I used cake flour instead of all-purpose flour.  I checked after 20 minutes, not 30 minutes, and they were done.  For those who have dense or dry cakes, try the cake flour and be sure to test after 20 minutes.  Also, as the recipe suggests, when adding the milk and flour to the batter, mix only long enough until consumed.  Otherwise you'll overmix it and it will come out dense/dry.I replaced vanilla extract with lemon extract too.  While the layers were thin, I still was able to cut them in half.  I used a sharp, serrated knife and it was fine. 

Also, for those of you who found the icing too sweet, try using 2 1/2 to 3 cups of powdered sugar instead.  I used 3 and found it absolutely sweet enough.  I also took the recommendations of other reviewers and put 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and 3 of milk instead of 2 and 2 as the recipe calls for.

The lemon custard filling is DIVINE!  Yes, it's tart but it's perfect.  I didn't use half for each of the layers as called for in the recipe but enough to generously cover the tops.  The leftover my husband enjoyed eating with a spoon! 

Thank you thank you thank you for sharing this recipe...it made everyone in my family happy!

This was very good, I followed it exactly but had 1/2 more icing.  It's really delicious but the cake is a bit heavy.  It's not that the cake is bad it's just not what I was expecting. I bet this would be good with an angel cake or something lighter.

Unbelievably wonderful! Lots of steps but that is just what it takes to make cakes this good!Amount of filling and frosting was perfect even for my family who likes lots.I took 2 hints from other reviewers: use 3/4 milk and 1/4 lemon juice in cake - absolutely perfect! Also, when frosting, do a "crumb layer"; i had never heard of that technique and will never frost a cake without doing it again. Very special cake! Thank you for sharing!

I was a little hesitant to make this because usually lemon is so overpowering. This isn't the case. All the ingredients in this cake blend together in perfect harmony. Delicious and moist! Yum!

I made this for a luncheon at work. I received numerous compliments and one coworker offered to buy a cake for Easter. I followed some other reviewers' recommendations: I used cake flour, replaced 1/4 cup of milk with lemon juice, and made extra lemon curd (but did not use it all). I also made extra frosting. This allowed me to use some for a crumb coat (thinned) and decorate the finished cake. Delicious, and a real keeper!

I made this cake for my husband's birthday. He chose the recipe, and I must admit I did not read the entire recipe before I started the cake so my only complaint would be the amount of time it takes to make and assemble. If you plan to make this you should make it the day before not only because of the time it takes to make but it really does get better the longer it sits. My husband and I were thrilled the kids did not like this cake because that meant more for us!! We ended up eating it over the next four days and liked it better each day we had it. Thank you for this great recipe! I did not feel it needed any adjustments, it was perfect as written.

I for some reason have a problem with the moistness of the cake. I know I don't over cook it. But it just isn't as moist like I would hope. Besides that, the filling and the icing....... incredible!

I think this recipe is fantastic! Just enough sweetness and tart. I would recommend doubling the buttercream frosting. I was conservative with the middle layer and I still didn't have enough to ice the rest of the cake.

I made cupcakes with this recipe for work.  Everyone loved it.

I filled liners one-half to three-quarters full and baked at 350 for 25-30 minutes.  The tops of the cupcakes didn't really brown, so just check with a toothpick.  After the cakes cooled I used the large size of a mellon baller and removed a little bit of the top of the muffin.  (about 1-1 1/2 tsp in volume)  I piped in the filling with a ziploc bag.  Then I piped the frosting on top, also with a ziploc.  I topped it all with some sugared lemon rine I isolated from the lemon with a zester.  Overall I used about 6 lemons total.

This cake is too sweet! 4 of us agree that the cake itself is very good, but the frosting is way too sweet. If I make this again I will double the cake recipe so that the filling and frosting layers aren't so close together. Also, the filling recipe could easily be cut in half, I ended up with a lot of leftover filling. The filling itself is very tasty, but tart. It resembles a lemon bar taste.

I loved the frosting and loved the filling. I made a mistake and followed some of the reveiwers advice and used a lemon cake mix however... and it was overkill! It was way too lemony (if that's a word). My guests (myself included) did not finish their serving and I was stuck with about one forth of the cake. It's still sitting on the counter. Ironically, I was told by several guests that the filling and frosting would have been wonderful on a white cake, grrrrr. I will make this again for sure, but take my advice and follow the recipe as stated. Make the white cake or you will end up with a lemon cake you can't even give away!

Made this cake for my mother's birthday (she loves lemon). It was my first real cake. A little time consuming, but totally worth it. I followed this recipe exactly and the cake turned out fantastic -- very moist and flavorful. The lemon curd is tart and delicious and the lemon frosting is absolutely the perfect finish - I did a double batch of the frosting to make sure there was enough for a crumb coat, which I would suggest to anyone for a "professional" looking cake.  (UPDATE) Made again, this time as cupcakes. Baked at 350 for 25 minutes. Perfect. Also used 1/2 c fresh lemon juice to replace half the milk in the cake. Used an apple corer to pop out holes in the tops, filled with the curd and frosted over the top. Ah-mazing!

Forgive me for picking nits (being a nitpicker) however this recipe says it's a Lemon Cake with Lemon Filling and Lemon Butter Frosting.  Am I the only one who doesn't see any lemon in the actual cake recipe?  I added lemon juice to the cake recipe and the whole thing was out of this world.

This is a labor intensive cake, and we made it back in May, but it is so delicious.  I doubled the lemon juice and zest, because we all love lemon so much, and used fresh lemons to derive juice and zest.  The second time I made it, we kicked back on the sugar in the cake itself by 1/4 cup, and it was even better because the lemon flavor wasn't overly sweet.  The icing is best when you let it sit in the refrigerator about an hour before icing; this thickens it up quite a bit.  Fabulous recipe!

I was very disappointed with this recipe. I guess I did something wrong since everyone else gave it glowing reviews, but I followed the recipe exactly.  After I baked the cake, it wasn't even an inch thick,so slicing was incredibly difficult. When I refrigerated it for a few hours, the filling had saturated the cake, so it was just a gooey mess.

I did not care for this recipe. It doesn't raise.  Its more like a soft cookie than a cake.  The lemon cream icing is grainy, and the curd between the layers is far too tart.  I made this for mother's day, and people didn't even finish the pieces they were served.  I'm a cake baker, and cakes tend to go quickly at my house, but this one did not.

This is good. I didn't make the filling listed -- I simply purchased lemon curd from the store instead. The frosting is amazing!

Very nice thankyou. I made it with Banana cake, and it went well. I didnt chill the filling in the fridge, just shoved it in the Freezer for about 20minutes and that worked.

I followed the recipe as directed and the cake was tasty but very dense. You must make the lemon curd filling first or the day before! For the lemon frosting, I used 4 T. lemon juice instead of 2 T. lemon juice and 2 T. milk, and the frosting was delicious and not too lemony. The lemon curd filling is VERY lemony and good, and you need the sweet frosting to counter act it. It says to refrigerate the cake and I did, but I preferred softening each piece in the microwave before eating. I think this cake would be even better with a white cake mix--it would be lighter and more moist. It would still be "homemade" because of the wonderful lemon curd and frosting.

I made today and it would have been great if the cake wasn't dry.  Shame on me for not checking for 30 minutes. Next time I will check at 20 minutes. The curd and icing are very good. I suggest adding the lemon and zest to your preference. I prefer more lemon. Unlike others, I would not want lemon in the cake, because that would be too much.  Definitely make the curd first so it can chill while you make the cake and frosting.

I made this cake for a friends birthday this past weekend and everyone loved it. I replaced 1/4 of the milk with the lemon juice like other reviewers had said to give it that lemony taste and to me it still wasn't very lemony. But the whole cake put together with the filling and the icing was perfect. The filling to me is what made the cake! I didn't have any problems with the filling being too runny, it was a nice consistency and I left it in the ice box for about 4-5 hours. I did however double the icing recipe because I like my icing thick when I decorate. And also instead of just putting the filling in between 2 layers I put a ring of icing around the cake tops, to create a barrier so the filling didn't come out, then I put the filling in the middle of the icing ring on every layer. It looked great and tasted fantastic! Overall it was definitely a great cake and something I will definitely use again!

This cake is pure lemon delight!  I agree with others - replace some of the milk in the cake recipe with lemon juice... will make all the difference in the world!  This recipe is SO worth trying... and keeping, as I am!

I tried to make this recipe twice after failing two times. I did everything the recipe said and tried again a second time to ensure that I did not do anything wrong. The filling was really good and lemony. However, the cake was extremely dense in a bad way. It was hard and not moist and turned out to be eggy.
 I would recommend making the cake itself out of chiffon cake or sponge cake if you're looking for that light and airy layered lemon cake. I used the buttercream icing and it was good too I didn't add the milk because it'd get too watery and I only used about 3 cups sugar and added some cream cheese to taste. For those who don't want their icing to be too sweet due to the icing sugar without losing the consistency, try adding about a teaspoon or so of salt (and no you won't taste the salt.)

This is a good basic yellow cake recipe. I had to add an extra 1/2 cup of flour, though, because the batter was very runny. The only other changes I made was to add 2 teaspoons of vanilla and 4 tablespoons of margarine and 4 tablespoons of oil. The cake came out a little dense but it still tasted yummy.

Overall this cake was simple to make except it does take a long time to complete each part. Make the lemon filling first to allow for cooling time. My cakes did not rise very much but I was able to cut them into two sections with a very sharp serated knife. Thank u for the recipe.

I haven't made this recipe (YET!), and I think it sounds fabulous... but I just wanted to say, as I read the recipe, I thought it makes much more sense start by making the filling, then letting it cool to room temp/ putting in fridge to cool for three hours, then make the cake and the frosting while the filling is in the fridge.  Just so save some time...But, really, it does sound like a fab cake, and I can't wait to make it for my mom!

This cake was really wonderful.  I made it for my daughter's 8th birthday party (a Yellow Submarine themed party!) and dyed the frosting yellow.  The cake is quite dense, like a cross between pound cake and cornbread, but that works well for the layering.  I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and refrigerated the two round cakes in saran wrap overnight before cutting them in half.  The cakes solidified, making them easier to split into halves.  I bought prepared lemon curd in the British section of the store (also found in some stores' baking sections) to save some time.  I also refrigerated the frosting to thicken it a bit, and I omitted the lemon zest but added a lot more lemon juice to the frosting to give it more zing.  It was really delicious, and it is definitely a keeper.  it does take some time to mix, bake,and assemble, but it's well worth the effort.  the results are delicious!  Highly recommended.

We loved everything about this cake.  I followed the directions, using the advice of others to start with the curd.  When the cake was baked, I wrapped the two layers individually in Saran wrap and refrigerated it for a couple of hours, and that helped me to be able to cut it in half easier.  I doubled the frosting so I could crumbcoat it, and after the final frosting, I added yellow food coloring to the remainder so I could decorate it.  Next time I will try 1 1/2 of the frosting.  This is a beautiful cake, and the only reservation I have is that it is very sweet/rich (even for someone with more than one sweet tooth like me!).  I want to make cupcakes like reviewer Wenderbell suggested.

I was very careful to not overmix the cake batter and it still came out a tad too dense.  I might use a cake mix the second time around.  I 1+1/2 the frosting recipe and had plenty but I only added 4 cups of powdered sugar (instead of the 6 that the conversion called for) and the frosting came out perfect! Also, the lemon curd is amazing, make sure to refrigerate it for the whole time, I can see how it could get runny if not fully cooled. This cake took me 4.5 hours to make, but I had the afternoon free and it was fun!

Good tasting cake!  The filling was great, and although I don't think there was enough, the icing had a great flavor, too.  The cake was a little dense ... it was hard to slice the two sections into halves.  They ended up being too thin and crumbling in some sections. Doesn't change the flavor, though ... yummy!  I also did the crumb frosted the cake, chilled it, then added remaining frosting to give it the perfect look.  Great cake!  Thanks!

Made just like recipe! Very dissappointed.  I love lemon cake but not this one!  Scrapped off the icing and added whipped topping to make it edible!  The lemong filling was ok.  Certainly wasted time and money on this one!

I have wanted to make this for a long time.  It was worth waiting for.  The only thing I did differently was use 4 8" pans, and baked for 12 minutes.  I did line the bottoms of the pans with parchment paper before greasing and flouring after reading that some people had issues with the cakes sticking.  My guests and hubby and I all loved it.  Will make again.  The perfect spring dessert.

I doubled the cake ingredients, making it so easy to cut.  I replaced the vanilla extract for lemon extract in the cake.  I also doubled the frosting ingredients, plus I added an additional 2 Tbsp of lemon juice to the frosting.  Following another review I frosted the sides and refrigerated for 15-20 minutes then frosted again.  The second layer covered the crumbled layer.  Also, I made the filling the night before.  Got rave reviews and it was gone in no time.  Will be making this again and again!  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this cake exactly as stated, although after reading other reviews on the cake being too thin to slice in half I poured the batter into 4 round cake pans and baked them for 15 mins. It turned out perfect. My kids didn't care for the lemon zest in the frosting, so the second time I made it I left out the zest in the frosting and used one teas. of lemon extract instead. It had a wonderful lemon flavor.

I added lemon juice to the cake batter like one reviewer suggested but the cake just wasn't that lemony. It was also kind of dense even though I used cake flour. I think I'll try to find a different recipe.

I made this for my mother, who is the ultimate lemon fan.  She loved it, but I must admit, it is not a cake for everyone to enjoy.  You must really be into lemon to like it because it is very tangy.  For a more universally-acceptable flavour, I would tame it down by omitting all lemon in the icing, or I would just use a vanilla buttercream recipe.  I didn't really care for the cake recipe, it was average.  The texture was a bit crumby, not velvety as I like my cake.  Cake flour might deliver a softer texture.  I was surprised to find there is no lemon in the cake batter.  I might add some zest in next time, which would add lemon flavour without being overpowering, as it is in the frosting.  The lemon curd was excellent, though, and very easy to make.  I speed-cooled it by putting it right into the freezer for 30 minutes, then spread it on the cake.  Three hours is unnecessary if you cook the curd right, it'll thicken up right away and won't get much thicker as it cools.  Bottom line is, use this recipe as a basis for your own creativity, because following by the T might not give you what you want.

I followed the instructions exactly and it turned out wonderfully. Even the frosting was just sweet enough to add to the flavor but not too sweet that I scraped it off (as I usually do.) Thanks so much!

This is a fantastic recipe!  Honestly, the cake does not rise too high, but the crumb is moist and dense, sort of like a wedding cake consistency.  Yum!  I made a few changes. I substituted 1/2 cup fresh lemon juice for 1/2 cup of the milk in the cake recipe.  I also used Crisco and butter flavoring instead of butter, and Egg Beaters instead of eggs.  I also added 2 tablespoons of lemon zest. For the frosting, I substituted Crisco and butter flavoring for the butter, and fresh lemon juice for the milk.  I also added 1 tablespoon of lemon zest.  I added more milk (1 tablespoon at a time)until the frosting reached the right consistency. I used Polaner's sugar-free fruit preserves instead of the lemon filling.  Blackberry works well.

i'll have to say this recipe is awesome.
it's at it's best cool from the refigerator, which makes it an great cake to eat in the summer.

like another reviewer said "it's VERY sweet an VERY lemony", but I woudn't change a thing! 

when I made this cake, I made only half the butter frosting, because I didn't have enough confectioner's sugar. half the dose wasn't enough. stick with the original quantities. I woudn't advise increasing the filling ingredients by one-half, as another reviewer said, as it would be waaaaaay too much sugar.

i really liked the soft texture, and i LOVED the contrast between the tart filling and the buttery frosting.

thanks, Michele!

This is one of the worst cake recipes I have ever made.  The cake is tough and course.  There is so much sugar in the total recipe that you need a drink of water between each bite.

I have been on this site for many, many years - this is my first review. I hate when people make a COMPLETELY different recipe (with all the alterations) but review it. But, on second thought, isn't that why we come to this site - to see reviews and how cooks have altered things to make it work better? So, in that spirit, I made the following changes: I used 9 inch pans (all I had) did 1 and 1/2 times the recipe (for cake and filling) and FILLING: Make first. CAKE: substituted cake flour for regular (not sure if it made a difference)Checked at 20 mins (it was done.) A good tip for flat cakes: (really helpful when layering so your cakes don't dome and are flat) Take a strip of old, clean towel; wet it and wring it out so it is damp. Wrap around your cake pans and secure with safety pins. It works, really. After the cake cooled, I used a serrated knife and the result was pretty flat cakes. FROSTING: 1 doubled the frosting recipe (very glad I did this, as I barely had enough) As did other reviewers, I changed the proportion of the milk/lemon juice to 3T milk & 1 T lemon juice (before doubling) I also used 4 cups powdered sugar total (did not double) and it was plenty sweet. So, overall, I LOVED the lemon filling. I didn't think it was that hard, just took some time to cool. The frosting was pretty good. The cake was WAY TOO DENSE. As others have said, it was almost hard.- I will not be making the cake again. So, 5 stars for filling, 4 for frosting, 2 for cake!

This cake was a disaster. The curd is good as is the frosting, but the cake itself was so heavy and dense. I made it three times following the recipe to the ounce. The cake must of weighed 5lbs.

This cake was great! I made it for my MIL's birthday and everyone liked it. I followed the directions as written with the one tiny exception of the frosting. I used all of my lemons making lemon juice for the filling so I didn't have any leftover for the frosting. I ended up substituting 1tsp lemon extract instead. It still turned out fine, although next time I will buy more lemons to make it as stated.

Awesome recipe and came out DELICIOUS, but my only suggestion is to make sure you make the FILLING first, before you do the cake or anything because it needs to be refrigerated for 3 hours..so it makes sense to do the the filling first, then the cake, then the frosting. I added more lemon juice and more lemon zest in the filling and the frosting to make it extra lemony. Great for summer time, light, and delicious!

This is a wonderful cake! It's lemony and the sweetness (of the cake base) would be just right if you halve it! The filling is aromatic and extremely rich in lemon, an ideal for lemon lovers! The cake is delicious and flavorful (i substituted 1/3 milk for lemon juice) though it was too dense and didn't rise well, even when cake flour was used. An improvement on the cake base would be helpful to perfect the cake!

I was very disappointed.  First of all this was not a lemon cake b/c there was no lemon in it.  Second of all the cake was sooo dry and dense.  This did make it easier to slice and handle but the taste is bad.  I like that the curd was sour but some people thought it was too much.  The frosting was good and the cake looks great.  I would recommend using a different cake recipe though.

I've never reviewed any recipes before but this one definitely deserves it, GREAT recipe!  And I didn't even think I would like lemon cake!  I made it exact except I did listen to other reviewers and make the cake with 3/4 c milk and 1/4 c lemon juice, it was fabulous!  Loved it!  So did everyone else!

This is a wonderful lemon cake recipe. I had an easy time turning this into a vegan cake, with a few egg and milk substitutions. 
For the milk, I used a cup of soy instead of the cup of milk called for in the recipe. The eggs were a little more tricky, as this recipe called for both whole eggs and egg yolks. I substituted the 3 eggs in the cake with 3 teaspoons of baking soda mixed with 3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar (regular vinegar would have worked just as well, I'm sure). For the egg yolks in the filling, I mixed a quarter cup of flour with a half cup of ice cold water, and heated the mixture in a saucepan on medium heat until it thickened up. Once the mixture was thickened (after about 10 minutes) I added a teaspoon of oil and used it as directed to use the egg yolks in the original recipe.

Really tasty, lots of lemon flavour.  A few things that kept me from giving 5 stars: 

1)  The cake was just a little dry.  I would have liked it to be a little lighter and springier.

2)  The lemon filling was just a little too thick/dense and I wished there was just a bit more of it (it was quite thin when spread out)

3)  I prefer a slightly creamier and fluffier frosting.  This frosting was just a little heavy on the dense/sugary side for me.

In all, the whole package came off as feeling quite dense and heavy when I would have preferred it to be slightly lighter.  But really none of that was any major flaw and I really liked it.  My husband doesn't like sugar frosting at all, so after the party, I got to eat all the leftovers, haha.

Very disappointed by this cake. I needed a lemon cake so I made this recipe. Where was the lemon in this cake??? Am I missing something? I added lemon zest and 1/2 cup of lemon juice to the batter. When it came out it had not risen at all and was dense & dry. It was more of a pound cake or coffe cake. I would give this 1 star except it was a decent coffee cake to dip in your coffee.

I made this cake exactly as directed, but used cake flour. My cakes did not rise very much, so I didn't cut them and decided to just go with 2 layers. I put the lemon curd in the middle and it all just dripped out of the sides of the cake. I refrigerated it to help it stay together and it helped some. Then I frosted it all and tried to get it all to stay together. The cakes turned out to be overly dense. I think I will make this again, but with a different white cake recipe.

I loved the cake part on this. It was a nice lightly sweetened sponge style cake. I plan to use the cake with other recipes. The filling however was good when it was warm, but after it cooled it seemed "super sweet yet very tart" oddly at the same time. This cake could have been better with a much milder lemon curd. I believe it may have been because of the rind in it? I thought the frosting tasted overly sweet to. A frosting more like whipped cream would have been less sweet. However, the icing did harden up nicely when I refridgerated it. I had planned to pipe a decoration, but there was almost none left after icing the cake. So, I just put a little decoration on the top. The cake did to look very pretty when cut though, and the layers held up nicely even before it was refridgerated. Even though I found the contrast of very tart and super sweet to not be to my liking, I made the cake for Easter and I am sure all or most of it will get eaten tommorrow. Just not a cake I would make again without some changes.

The lemon curd was the best part about this recipe. The cake part was tough and dry. The frosting was to thick even after extra milk added. Tasted like the cake, frosting, and filling didn't go together. I made this recipe exactly as written.

Fantastic!  I have made a different recipe of lemon curd before and the instructions from that recipe had you pour the curd through a fine mesh strainer, which I did with this recipe of lemon curd as well.  It was nice and smooth.  I doubled the frosting recipe because I do not like to scrimp on the frosting.  It was more than I needed and next time I will just increase it by 50%.  I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and did a "crumb" layer of frosting when finishing off the cake.  This made the cake very easy to finish frosting.  It is very impressive when you slice it.

I added a little lemon zest and fresh lemon juice to the cake mix and some lemon extract to the icing but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  It was wonderful!  It was so light and fresh tasting and not overly lemony (even with the extra lemon flavoring).  One hint: let the filling set the entire 3 hours!  Don't rush this step... take it from one who knows.

I made these into lemon-filled cupcakes...yum!  The lemon filling is SUPER lemony.  I made the frosting without the lemon zest and juice; instead, added some of the lemon filling to the frosting for adequate lemon flavoring.  I will definitely make these again but with a little less lemon juice in the filling next time.

This turned out perfect! I made it into a yellow and pink lemonade cake. The filling was the best. I used another recipie for the frosting, a buttercream recipie.

I am rating this as only 3 because the cake was so flat that I would have needed 3 or 4 of them to make a 4 layered cake. The filling, however, is phenomenal! I threw out the scratch cakes, used 2 yellow cake mixes with 1 cup of sour cream and 1 package of lemon pudding each, then layered those. I used the lemon filling in the middle, and strawberry jam stirred to filling consistency as the filling for the other 2 layers. Topped the cake with butter icing recipe provided and decorated with strawberries... was a HUGE hit!

This cake is awesome!  After making it once, I made a few changes.  I made 50% more custard to fill the middle layer, rather than the frosting.  I also added a tsp of lemon extract to the custard.  The frosting is a little sweet but still very good.  I only added 1/2 the milk because the first batch was a bit runny.  The batter was perfect and very moist...used 8.5 inch pans and worked out well.

I am giving this only 4 stars because I like my lemon cake to actually be lemon cake. I added a package of prepared lemon pudding to the batter of mine along with a little lemon juice. The only other change I made was the addition of whipped cream mixed with a little of the lemon curd to add a border. It came out perfect!

I made this cake exactly as written with the exception of baking the batter in one  8" x 3" round cake pan. The baking time was a little longer but I like baking layer cakes this way as I then only have one rounded top to deal with. (and bonus, only one to clean) Each component of the cake was great. In future the only adjustment would be to use about half of the lemon curd between the layers as I felt the flavor a bit too intense for my taste.  I liked the density of the cake. It held up nicely to slicing into layers. Overall, this recipe is a keeper. Thanks

I made this cake for my friends birthday and the frosting and fillings was WONDERFUL! They were very lemony like I had hoped and I did have to put yellow food coloring in to the front as suggested.  The reason that I gave this 3 stars was because of the cake itself. I was not impressed at all with it. It didn't rise so I only got 2 layers which wasn't what upset me the most, but it was very hard. It was almost like eating a biscut. As a biscut it would have been great but not as a cake. Next time I will buy a boxed white cake and use only the frosting and filling recipes.

This is great. If you love lemon you will love this. I followed the recipe exactly. The cake does come out very dense. I was not able to cut the cakes in half to have a 4 tier. Next time I will use cake flour.

This is the cake I made for my son's birthday and it was a huge hit.  I wanted a 13x9 cake and I wanted it at least 4inches tall, so I doubled the recipe for the cake part.   I made just one recipe worth of the lemon filling and that covered two of my layers.  For the middle layer, I used a pomegranate/berry conserve I had in the fridge.  It was a great add as it was very complimentary to the lemon filling and it added a nice hint of colour in the middle.  I also needed about 1.5 recipe worth of icing to cover the cake.

YUMMY!!!!  I was a little lazy and didn't have time to make the cake from scratch so I used a box mix.  But I did make the filling and frosting as the recipe directed.  It turned out fabulous and super tasty!  Paired it with Barefoot Moscato wine, which really complements the lemon flavors in the cake/filling/frosting.

This cake looked really rich and fatty to me, so i omitted the filling and frosting. Instead, i made a REALLY GOOD cream-cheese lemon glaze, and i sifted the dry ingredients, and i think that gave the cake a really nice touch. DELISH!

Im glad I started making this recipe the day before I needed it. The cake was VERY heavy and had a weird corn bread kind of taste/texture. I did not use it and ran out for boxed mixes the next morning. The curd was very sour, but tasted like real lemon as opposed to a sugary lemonaid type taste. The frosting was awesome. I ended up doing 5 layers of cake (3 boxes of white cake mix) with two layers of curd and two layers of frosting in between. I doubled the curd and frosting recipes and had enough to do all of the layers and frost the whole thing - including a crumb coat. I had to drive the cake up the 405 freeway and the top 4 layers ended up sliding off the bottom curd layer, and then when I was serving the cake the top layer fell off the other curd layer - its slippery! Someone suggested using a few wooden dowels to hold it all in place. Will definitely make the curd/frosting again, skip the cake.

Just a note to anyone making this..i found the cake very blan, the lemon curd awesome...but not enough. I think that if you put a lemon sauce over the cake first it would help. Then put the lemon curd on top of that it would enhance the cake taste. I am going to try this to see if it helps, ill let you know.

We did not like this recipe at all, and I love anything lemon.  The cake recipe did not call for any lemon, so I'm not sure why it is called a lemon cake.  The filling had a weird after taste to it, and was overly lemony and I have made home made lemon curd before.  The icing did not taste like lemon at all and had a very sweet taste and gritty texture.  I would not make this again and was truly dissapointed after all the great reviews it got.

My mother who is the lemon cake lover LOVED this one.  I did add more lemon juice to icing and would recomend making the filing first so it can be chilling while baking the cake.

I love this recipe, but I did make a few changes.  I purchased a jar of lemon curd and mixed one pint of fresh raspberries in with the curd.  I substituted the Lemon Butter Frosting with Lemon Cream Cheese Frosting, using one 8-oz package of cream cheese, 4 T butter, 1 box plus 1 cup of powdered sugar, 1/4 cup lemon juice and lemon zest.  If the frosting is still too thin, add more powdered sugar until it's the desired consistency.

This cake was a hit at Bunco! It was a perfect blend of sweet and tart!  I didn't make the cake from scratch, but instead used a boxed white cake.  The lemon curd and lemon buttercream frosting were simple and VERY tasty!  I sprinkled the cake with lemon rind for decor!

SPECTACULAR!  I cannot rave enough about the lemon filling...I love it and make it all the time.  If you don't feel like making the cake from scratch, just used boxed lemon...but make the filling and frosting and you'll be rewarded!

SWEET, SOUR, and DELICIOUS! This recipe definitely plays with your taste buds, but if you love lemon as much as I do, you won't find a better cake. There's no lemon in the actual cake part, but plenty of flavor in the frosting and filling.

Be warned:  This is a VERY sweet and VERY lemony cake.  Only people who like that combination will enjoy this cake.

I made this frosting for the "Lemon Bundt Cake" by Phyllis (on this website) and it was just PERFECT together!!!  I haven't made this cake recipe, so I can't vouch for the cake, but the frosting was ROCKIN'!!!  I got rave reviews!!!  The frosting wasn't too sweet, it was just right!  If you are disappointed in this cake recipe try this frosting with the Lemon Bundt Cake recipe!  You'll love it!  Oh, and for the "soda" in the cake recipe, I substituted Sprite!  Yum!!!!!

After reviewing all the posts,I decided to doctor this cake recipe a bit, by adding the following: Kool-aid (lemonade), lots of lemon juice, lemon extract and yellow food coloring. I then used store-bought lemon curd, for the filling,(Mrs Robinsons brand), to shorten my laboring in the kitchen.  Furthermore, having experienced a shortage of frosting in previous cake disasters, I made two separate batches of frosting, one for a crumb coating, and then a final batch for the decorative stage.  This cake was an overall winner with my friends and family, however, although on the sweet side, my only disappointment, was, that I had to make two cake batches, due to the fact that the first batch did not rise well enough to have it cut into four layers, as the recipe calls for.  Yes, the entire process was cumbersome, but well worth the effort.  Thanks for everyones' reviews, I found all of them to be extremely helpful in my planning!

I gave this 4 stars because of it's taste.  Just as good as any in a bakery. I was looking for a cake with lots of lemon everywhere and this is it.  To enhance the lemon flavor more I added half a pack of lemon kool-aide to the cake as the recipe is for a white cake.  The lemon was all in the frostings.  Great cake.
Also, this is not a cake to make late in the day.  It is a bit time consuming so be prepared so you aren't rushed and dissapointed.

Besides being told that it tasted sweet, I thought it was great as I made it, I made the cake lemon by adding lemon juice for part of the milk.

It was okay, for all of the time put into it. I read the reviews and had hoped it would be amazing. It was for my son's birthday; he said he wanted a lemon cake. I thought it was okay, but not what I expected. My kids were on the fence; one said it was okay, one said too sour and the other said it was good, but not great. My husband said he didn't care for it and requested that I not make it again.

The star of this recipe is the frosting. Its light, fluffy, and the perfect sweetness/lemon tang. The cake is mild which pairs perfectly with the tart lemon curd (I made the Microwave Lemon Curd on this site for  more speed and less dishes).  Husband loved his lemon birthday cake!

The cake had great flavor, but it was a bit dense. I may not have beat it long enough. It is definitely a do again, though.

I did not care for this recipe.  I had friends over for dinner and no one wanted to finish it. The cake layer was to dense for everyone's liking and the filling was way to tart, even to those who normally love lemon flavored desserts.  The frosting was ok, nothing spectacular.

I tried a lot of cake recipes and this is the best one. I only made the cake and frosting, it is taste very good, except it is little too sweet for me. I will use this recipe again next time and cut down 1/4 cup of sugar for the cake.

I made just the cake part of this recipe for my son's birthday (was recommended in 'the buzz') and used the frosting from "Daisy Brand Sour Cream Chocolate Cake" - that went very well with this.  I thought the cake was delicious, DH thought it was dense but everyone else said it was good.  I used almond extract instead of vanilla, DH really can't stand vanilla - I loved that extract in this, I'll make it again :)

I did not care for this recipe. If the cake recipe itself was better, everything would have been great. Oh...it's not a lemon cake either...just has lemon filling and frosting. I was very dissapointed in the cake recipe. I might try again with a better cake. The filling and frosting turned out fine.

AMAZING RECIPE! For one of my many family get-togethers, I was in charge of cupcakes. Knowing that my father loved lemon, I came upon this recipe. Making the cupcake was easy, just fill the cupcake with the filling after they are finished cooking, then ice! Everyone loved them!!

This cake is fabulous! I made it today and the only change I made was adding more lemon juice and lemon zest into the frosting. The filling is delightfully tart and compliments the super sweet frosting wonderfully. My boyfriend loved it and I will definately be making this again!

I love lemon cake, and I loved making this,
but there was one small thing that made me not want to eat this.

I hated the lemon zest. There was too much of it in the frosting and the filling. I don't really think the zest has ANY impact on the flavor at all, and it's way too stringy and annoying and bad tasting. If I were to make this again, I would make it without the zest so that I wouldn't have to eat around the frosting and filling.. and this cake took me way too long to prepare for me to just eat around the lemon part. (4 hours..)

 But besides all of that, I really liked the cake. The lemon taste is really good and sweet. I recommend this for anyone who loves lemon.

I love lemon curd, and didn't have time, so I made it with the jarred curd from the store.. very good... it is a strong lemon for the filling, so don't do what I did and take liberties to add more unless you are a lemon fanatic... it was a little overpowering, but that was my fault, not the recipe's!  YUM!

I used this recipe for the filling and frosting... I used some lemons a friend gave me.... The filling and cake came out WAY TOO TART/SOUR!!! Not sure if it was the home grown lemons or the amount of lemon juice & zest. I think it would be really good if you use SWEET lemons and be careful not to use too much. I used a white box cake to save time and insure a good texture. Also, next time maybe I wouldn't add lemon to the icing....

The only change I made to the recipe itself, and this is not extreme, was adding about 1 tablespoon of lemon zest to the cake batter. Fantastic and lemony confection-as it should be. Great recipe!

This turned out beautifully!  I made it in a bundt pan, 350 for about 50 min, so that I could cut it into more than 12 pieces easily.  Since it could end up a disaster, I cut it into 3 layers - using the lemon curd on the 2 inside layers and all the frosting on the outside.  I added a few drops of lemon food coloring - it was for my 2 year old son's birthday, and he asked for a "yellow cake"!  Maybe because it was a bundt I had more than enough frosting, and it was quite sweet!

My son insists I give this cake 5 stars.  I made it for his 11th birthday and he loved it.  He can not have chocolate and loves lemon cake.  The adults liked it too.  I do agree that the cake could use a little lemon zest, however, my cake rose beautifully and seperated nicely from the pan edges.  My guess is  the reviewer who complained that the cake stuck did not grease the pans well enough.  I made the curd and the cake the night before and put it all together the next morning.  The cake should definitely be refridgerated prior to serving as it allows the frosting to harden which is better for the overall cutting and tasting of the cake.  We will make this one again.

I am rating the filling and the buttercream frosting because I used a boxed lemon cake mix. The filling and the frosting are both absolutely delicious! The filling is wonderfully tangy with an intense lemon flavor and the frosting is velvety smooth and delightfully sweet with a slight hint of lemon flavor, the two balance each of perfectly. I did not find it overwhelming in the least to add to this combination another dimension of lemon by using a lemon cake mix. I made twice the amount of frosting and it was just enough to frost a 4 layer 9" cake. This was a terrific variation from the flavors that I would typically choose, very refreshing.

I made a simplified version of this cake.  To save time, I used a white box mix.  In between the 2 cakes, I used raspberry preserves.  Then I sliced each cake in half and used store bought lemon curd. Cutting into the cake is beautiful - layer of yellow curd, layer of red, and another layer of yellow.  I made the frosting as written.  I served this cake tonight at my book club and all the ladies couldn't believe it was homemade...they were very impressed.  Thanks for a great idea for what became a unique dessert!

Excellent Cake! There is something to be said about the clarity and detail of these instructions... Thank You Submitter! I followed the directions exactly except I didn't remove the cake from the pan after cooling for 10min. I should have, they were stuck after 45min cooling at room temp. I damaged 1 during removal and the other I put back in the oven at 350 F for about 8 min and it came unstuck! Excellent trick to remember in the future!   I thought the cakes was too thin to cut horizontally after I "trimmed to level," so I only had a 2 layer cake with a filling layer in between. It was difficult to frost because of the crumbs mixing into the frosting. I'm glad read 1 reviewers instruction on a Crumb Layer... it worked very well. I will absolutely make this cake again, but in slightly smaller pans or increase the ingredients by 1/2.

I wish I would've followed the original recipe... I followed one of the custom/modified versions of this recipe and the rounds of the cake were so thin there was no way I could halve them without ruining them. So I made the cake a two-layer instead of four-layer. No complaints from my family though! Everyone loved how lemony the cake was, but did find it to be quite heavy. I will use less frosting next time; probably won't put any between the layers just the curd and lightly frost the outside of the cake. Can't wait to make this again!

Wonderful! Moist, delicious and GORGEOUS! This was a big hit with my whole extended family. I replaced all the lemon with orange (because I have a non-lemon loving sister) and it worked out marvelously. In the interest of saving eggs, I used the whites leftover from making the filling in the cake batter instead of using three whole eggs. It worked out just fine and I would definitely recommend that everyone try this.

If you love lemon then this is the cake for you.  I followed the recipe as it is written and it turned out great.  I did need extra icing though, so I would make at least 1 1/2 batches.

I made 1 1/2 the cake batter, subbed lemon extract for vanilla extract and baked for 29 minutes in 9" round cake pans.  I made the filling (as specified for 8" cakes and still had plenty leftover) a day ahead of time and let sit in the fridge overnight.  I eyeballed the frosting measurments, adding lemon juice/zest/extract to taste. I brought this to work for a coworkers birthday and everyone enjoyed it.  I was pleased that my layers stayed in tact (no problems with sliding, it was refrigerated until just before serving); however, the top layer had a rather gel-like consistency.  I assume this was from the cake soaking up the lemon curd as I pressed on the top while frosting.  Otherwise, like others have said this is a very dense, very sweet cake, but that doesn't mean it's bad!  I had no problems slicing/layering the cake precisely because it was so dense and, well, cake is supposed to be sweet.  Personally, I would prefer a lighter cake with more tartness so next time I would sub cake flour for AP flour and refrigerate the layers before attempting to slice them in half/frost them.  I would also reduce the amount of sugar in the lemon curd to offset the sweetness of the frosting.  Overall, this was a good cake and the individual slices look beautiful with the layering of curd & frosting.

I didn't want to lower ratings so gave 5 star. I altered the recipe. I didn't want a heavy cake as was written from other reviews.  I made the cake as directed except I added 1/4 cup fresh lemon and zest and 3/4 milk. I separated the eggs and only put the egg yolks in and then beat the egg whites to fold in at the end. Made lemon curd as directed as well as the frosting. The frosting is a little grainy but still taste good. (I will find another way next time for the frosting). I made this recipe my own so don't want to miss lead by saying I followed the recipe. turned out very moist and fluffy. Thankful for the idea.

Wow! This is the best! I made the cake in 9" pans which was a mistake, they were a bit dry and thin but o.k. It is the frosting and lemon curd that really make this special! I've since bought 8" pans so I can make it correctly.

I thought this cake was very good. I was worried after reading some of the reviews that this cake would be very dense, so I did change a couple of things. I used cake flour (instead of AP flour) and I added a box of instant lemon pudding. I also added some lemon juice (I'd guess about 3 T.) to the cake as well to help balance the extra dry ingredients of the pudding. It gave the cake a light lemon flavor that complimented the filling and icing. I baked the cake in two oval pans (from Wilton) and they were exactly the right size! I had to bake at 350 for about 35 minutes or so, but they came out perfectly! I had nice thick cakes that were easy to cut in half and were elegant when stacked on top of each other with the lemon filling and icing. However, I could not get this cake to stay together - the layers kept sliding off! I tried skewers, but they were not heavy enough to hold this cake together. It was delicious, but not presentable! However, my husband and his cousin, the experts in all things lemon, loved it. My husband had even told me that I shouldn't make frosting that wasn't cream cheese, but he still enjoyed this lemon buttercream!

This recipe was superb. I used it to make a mini-wedding cake for some friends. I would suggest making 1 1/2 to 2 times the frosting though, so that you have enough for decorating the top of the cake

This makes a very nice cake.  I did add lemon extract to the cake itself in addition to the vanilla.  It was a little difficult to slice because it crumbles - so be careful not to over-bake it.  For those want to use different sized pans, you'll need to double the recipe for a single 1/2 sheet cake.  I'm guessing there is about 4 1/2 to 5 cups batter in one recipe. Bake about 35 minutes and put a flower nail in the center of the cake to help keep it level and cooked through.  Quadruple the frosting for a sheet cake if you plan on frosting and decorating with it. For me the texture was perfect for a "from scratch" cake- just not the super light spongy cake box cakes everybody is used to.    Also the filling is not too tart - it's a wonderful balance against the sweet frosting.  Very refreshing.  Serve with a lime or lemon sherbert and this would be a wonderful baby/wedding shower cake.

I made this cake for Easter and it turned out great.  The only changes I made were to add some zest and lemon extract to the cake and I only baked it for 25 minutes.  I didn't split my layers, but put the filling in between the two layers and then frosted the top and sides.  I got a nice moist cake- not too dense, but not as light as a box mix.  I think it is key to make sure the sugar and butter get beaten until really light and fluffy.  At least 5 minutes on high.  I have made this mistake with other cakes in the past and they have come out too dense.  The filling was perfect and a nice counterpoint to the sweet frosting.

This is the best lemon cake I have ever had! It's sweet and delectable. I would however recomend replacing the vanilla extract with lemon extract for a full lemon flavor.

This recipe is awesome!  I made it for my annual family picnic this year and it was a big hit!  The only thing I changed was that I added lemon juice to the cake batter.

I made this for my husband's birthday and he said it was the best cake he had ever had. I had never made a cake completely from scratch before so I followed the directions exactly, with the one exception of only using 4 sticks of butter- did not have that extra 6 tablespoons the recipe called for. We finally had the cake at 10pm at night and were on a sugar high for quite some time!

Very yummy- make extra lemon curd so you will have leftovers for pancakes or scones!  It's delicious, but quite acidic, so it only takes a little to get alot of flavor.  The cake is dense, and sort of crumbly, but tasty (especially when hot out of the oven!).  To cool the curd quickly, use an ice bath.

I made this cake for my Easter dinner dessert and everybody loved it. I had comments like, "This tastes like it came from a professional bakery" and "You could sell this". I thought this cake was very easy to make, even though some of the steps sounded scary to me. I followed the recipe exactly and did use sifted cake flour instead of regular flour as someone suggested and my cake was not super dense like some people had mentioned. The layers did move around a bit while I was tring to frost it, so it was a little crooked, but nobody cared! It was delicious!

Made this for an office birthday.  Got incredible feedback - it was really really good.  The only thing I would change is to make more filling and more icing as there was not enough.  I ended up making more so I could cover the sides of the cake.

I made this cake for a birthday at our office & is was loved!!    It was very time consuming to make but yummy!!  The very tart lemon filling complimented the sweet frosting (I added 2 tablespoons of lemon juice to the frosting & am glad i did!).   The cake is a bit dry but I feel it was a great match for the gooey/sweetness of the rest of the cake & perhaps needs to be such to keep from soaking up the filling.  I thought the frosting looked too thin in the photo so I made a batch & a half -- while frosting I thought "i'm glad a made extra" but while eating I thought "didn't really need that extra frosting".  
I'll definitely make this again for my lemon mereinge pie loving sister.

I doubled the recipe and made this cake for a bridal shower...It was amazing!  The guests kept saying that it was the best cake they ever had.  The lemon filling and lemon butter frosting were, I thought, cake-store quality.  I recommend that you use Meyer lemons, baker's sugar, and baker's flour for this recipe.

I only gave this recipe 4 stars because I didn't make the cake. Weird I know but there was no lemon in the cake and my friend, who I was making the cake for, wanted lemon cake & lemon frosting!  I did make the filling and frosting and both were DELICIOUS!!  The filling is a bit tart but goes perfectly with the frosting.  I would make again.  Everyone who tired it loved it!

I made this for Easter dinner.  It was very good.  I would actually make a little more icing next time, I seemed to run a short.  Other than that, it was a very good recipe! The lemon curd is delicious.

Great recipe.  I substituted 1/4 cup of the milk with fresh lemon juice as someone else suggested, or its really not lemon cake.  For some of the reviewers that didn't like the texture or thought it to be too dry, make sure you sift the all purpose flour before you measure it. That can make a big difference.

I made this for my husband. I was disappointed there was no lemon in the cake so I added 2T lemon juice and 1t zest. Because I added more liquid, I added more flour. I made them as cupcakes. I only got 23 cupcakes. I also doubled the lemon juice in the icing. Two thumbs way up there!!!  I will make these again.

Great taste! I took my time to make sure I did it right so it took a whole day to make two cakes, I followed the recipe to a tee, I had a couple of hiccups but because of the great directions it actually turned out well I found the cake to be dense and full of lemon. I actually added Peach Tree Snaps to the icing ??

I made this cake for my aunt. She loves lemon cake. She said she wanted lemon everything.  This cake is WOW..its absolutely amazing in that lemon pucker-zing you hope to find in such a cake. You start eating and you cannot stop..you lick the plate..you add more frosting or lemon curd its soo good. I only added lemon juice to the actual cake..everything else kept the same. This cake will be made again. .and again..ohhh so lemon good.

Made this cake twice in one day. The first time I thought I must have left something out. The second time it turned out exactly the same way. The cakes were much too dense and hardly rose at all.

This is certainly one of the best cakes I have ever tried. I didn't have time to refrigerate any of it for 3 hours, so I used lemon curd from England for the filling. The cake was amazing. I also added lemon zest to the cake and a box of dry vanilla pudding mix. I kept the icing as it is originally. I'd make it with the described filling if I didn't have excellent lemon curd. The resulting cake is small, but just right for eating up in a few days.

I made only the frosting from this recipe to frost coconut cupcakes.  It was really easy and delicious!  I added another small squeeze of the lemon into the frosting after I had mixed it up, because I wanted a little more tartness to counter the sweetness of the coconut.  It was really easy to spread, and frosted 22 cupcakes.  After frosting the cupcakes, I topped them with toasted coconut.  They were fantastic!

I made exactly as directed and it came out perfect. As others mentioned, you have to make the filling first and fridge for three hours so plan ahead. I baked four thin cake rounds instead of trying to cut two in half. I also made double the frosting but only needed maybe 1 1/2, felt like a waste throwing all that out. I almost detoured from the recipe and added lemon to the cake as i noticed it was a white cake, but I'm sure glad i didnt because the icing and the filling were very lemony by themselves.

Wonderful lemon cake! I followed suggestions to use cake flour, reduce powdered sugar in frosting and add lemon juice in cake.  I also added yellow food coloring in the frosting. Great lemon taste and I will make again

Cake is too dense and does not rise. Lemon filling was overly tart.

The 5 stars is for the lemon filling. I didn't make the other two recipes. But the filling is delicious, nice and tart. It complemented the lemon flavored cake and Marshmallow fondant I made to go with it!

This is a wonderful cake! I had just spent a few hours baking 2 other layer cakes that went terribly wrong, and this one finally worked. Very well, too! It was moist and light and very tasty. I did the cake and the curd, and used my own frosting (whipped cream). I will make this again as soon as possible. One thing that might have been different though is that it really didn't rise much, each cake was barely an inch high. I only made two layers as this was my original plan, but maybe for four layers this would be problematic. All in all everyone enjoyed the cake and there was nothing leftover!

This cake is just ok.  I followed the instructions completely yet my frosting was too runny and ran off the cake.  The cake itself is just mediocre and too dense for my liking.  The lemon filling layer is absolutely fabulous though. That being said, I will not be making this again.

Everything about this recipe was amazing! I added a little more lemon juice to the frosting instead of lemon zest but that was all I changed. I will definitely be making this again.

I followed the recipe exactly. The cake itself was too crumbly and did not rise well. The lemon butter frosting was phenomenal, I loved it! The lemon filling was good on its own, but overpowered the cake when it was all put together. The whole result was just too much lemon flavor. In the future, I would use my own yellow cake recipe, and only do one layer of lemon filling, with the lemon butter frosting.

Based on another review, I made the cake with pastry flour rather than all purpose, and I used 1/4 cup of lemonjuice and 3/4 cup of milk.  The cake was delicious.  The lemon curd was also delicious, thick and tangy.  The frosting on the other hand was terribly sweet.

This cake was absolutly amazing. I made for a large group of people and I got rave reviews for it. Even though I made two it turned out that one was enough. It was too sweet for a few of my guests. Also there was a lot of extra filling and frosting. Overall I loved the cake and will make it again. Thanks!

Good, but I would make a few adjustments next time. Like other reviews I felt like the cake was a bit heavy. However the lemon curd filling was absolutely incredible, as was the icing.

WOW! This is SOOOOO good.  Took it to the office, rave reviews.  I put it in a 9x13 instead and doubled the filling amount (didn't use all of it, but needed more than one batch to cover that surface).  The filling and frosting are absolutely amazing.

Excellent, even though I did the lazy, low fat version. I only used the cake portion of this recipe & filled it with sugar free instant vanilla pudding mixed with a teaspoon of lemon extract. I lightened up the cake using apple sauce instead of butter, subbed in agave nectar & eggs beaters, and added one teaspoon lemon extract. Even the non-cake-fan hubby liked it =)

I baked this cake and follow the exact recipe. The cake and frosting taste really good but the filling was absolutely horrible. Tasted to much like egg- more specifically yoke. I ended up scraping the filling and throwing it out. Filled it with a jam instead. I would make it again but fit it with something else.

The flavor of the cake is great, but I don't know if it is worth all of the work that you have to do to get a good finished product.  I made this for the family dessert last night, and most everyone liked it, but weren't in love with it enough for me to make it very often.  This was my first attempt in making a 4-layer cake and having to slice layers of cake.  They didn't turn out too shabby.  The only probelm I had was getting my frosting to stick to the cake. Every time I would try to spread it, it would pull away from the cake.  I am going to try and figure out why that kept happening.  Overall, the cake is great, just a little time consuming.

I used 1.5 times the ingredients and made two 9" round cakes (could not find 8" pans anywhere!).  I used my cheese grater to zest the lemons and it worked really well.  Also, I only refrigerated the filling for an hour to save time and it was fine.  I was a bit worried about cutting each cake into two parts, but I found this website and it really helped.  The cake turned out beautifully (and tasty!).

I tried this recipe as written.  It didn't go well from the get-go.  I made the cake mix as the recipe instructed, but when I went to get the cake out of the pans, it stuck like glue!  It came out in a wad and tasted spongy.  I used the butter and flour as suggested, but I think it was the flour that actually made the cake stick.  Regardless, the frosting and filling were fine.  I will be trying this again with yellow cake mix as others have done.

Wonderful! The icing and filling are so yummy! The cake is your regular white cake recipe. I increased the recipe by 1/2 so it would fit in my 9" cake pans and I'd have enough frosting and filling which made everything just right. Make sure to add filling to the cut side of the cake. If you put it on the "cooked" side, the filling tends to slide off.

This recipe was really good.  If I got to do it all over, I'd use a different recipe for the cake part...it was a little dry.  The filling was soooo good.  The frosting was great and I made it even more lemony by adding more zest and juice.  I also added a layer of fresh sliced strawberries...so good.

I just made this cake had a great time, but my husband and I really didn't enjoy the flavors very well.  I was pretty let down because it looked beautiful and I was really in the mood for lemon.  I didn't think the curd was sweet enough and I really didn't like the flavor of the vanilla in the cake.  I wish I had ommitted that and added lemon juice instead.  I had plenty of icing and curd though, I just wish it all tasted a little better.

This was a delicious lemon cake.  I made it for a baby shower, and everyone loved it.  Didn't change a thing, but made some extra frosting to make it a bit thicker and smoother.  Definately a keeper!

This is a wonderful cake.  It is light and very moist.  It may be the best cake I have ever made.  After reading the reviews, I used cake flour instead of all purpose flour (my only change).  I made it for my mother's birthday and she loves every thing lemon.  She was more than pleased.  Thank you ever so much for sharing your wonderful recipe.

Best lemon cake ever- I took the advice of a previous poster and used 1/4 lemon juice and 3/4 cup milk in the cake, and then just added lemon juice/extract to taste in the frosting. I'll make it again!

I used a lemon box cake (I added 1 tsp vanilla to it and substituted butter for the oil) and purchased lemon curd, but made the layers and used the frosting recipe from this.  Everyone loved it.  Tasted like something from a bakery.

CAKE FLOUR. Other than that, followed recipe to a tee. Yes, if the cake is used decoratively, double the icing is needed. But not for taste. Best cake I have ever made or tasted, and absolutely perfect wedding cake. LOVED. oh but extremely time consuming.

The lemon filling is very powerful. Although it was very good. I don't like when my lemon recipes only have a hint of lemon. This definitely wasn't a hint. It was a nice zing to the cake, complimented it very well.

If you like lemon cakes this is the cake to make! It does take a lot of time but is well worth it. I had to add extra confectioners sugar to the frosting to make it thicker but it all depends on how you like your frosting! One other tip I did was sliced up some strawberries and pressed them on the sides and a few on the top and it was perfect. The strawberries give you that little bit of sweet to offset all of that lemon! Very good would highly recommend it!

Baking time needs to be less or the cake dries out. Used store bought lemon filling b/c of other reviewers complaints of the filling melting into cake. Also added extract to the cake mix in place of vanilla. Refridgerated cake until using and then pulled it out 20-30 minutes prior to eating to warm up. Will likely make again!

I followed another review that said to double the icing and do a crumb layer or icing. EXCELLENT TIP! Loved that.   Didn't like the cake sliding apart or the taste of the white cake. I'd do this again, but look for a better 'cake' recipe.   Icing and lemon curd were fantastic though! A

I followed the instructions without any changes.  It was a dud.  The cake didn't rise, and was eggy smelling, sweet and heavy.  The curd is ok, much like the usual lemon curd but a bit too tart for my taste.  The icing was too sweet.  I was looking forward to have a nice fluffy lemon filled cake as the closure to a great meal, but this was really disappointing.  Next time I want lemon cake, I think I'll find another cake base that actually comes out fluffy, make a less tart curd, and use an icing recipe from elsewhere.

I made this cake for a party and everyone loved the cake.  My husband is not a big cake fan, but he was a huge fan of the lemon cake. For decoration and taste, I topped the cake with fresh raspberries.  Very easy cake to make.  I will make this recipe again!

So lemony.  I did add 1.5 times the amounts, because I have bigger cake pans.  I replaced a half cup of milk for lemon juice for a more lemon flavor to the cake.  Everyone enjoyed this.

I made just the cake and the frosting and it yielded 13 cupcakes. I also added a small amount of yellow food color to the frosting.  I am very happy with this recipe--I will make it again in the future and try the lemon filling as well.

I didn't put the filling in the cake, but it was really good without it. And the frosting is AMAZING!! I didn't have lemons so I just used lemon juice and lemon extract and it was really good. I also use the frosting recipe for just plain vanilla (replace the lemon with vanilla) and it's sooo good!

This cake was delicious!  I made it for a family party and everyone raved.  I used a french vanilla cake mix and used the lemon curd and frosting recipes.  I made the curd the day before to help with time, and couldn't wait to finish after I snuck a little taste.  The only problem I had was my frosting melted off the sides, due to the fact that I used light butter (unknowingly), so make sure you use real, regular butter!  I will definatly make this again.

This cake took a bit of time.  The lemon curd was fantastic and lemony.  Came out looking just like the pic. Recipe took almost 4 fresh lemons.  I found the butter icing a bit sweet and would likely to try it with a cooked icing next time.

Yum.  Even my mother-in-law liked it.  Great, intense lemon flavors.  The variety of textures was amazing.

Every part of this recipe is extraordinary. I wouldn't change anything, and that is a rare comment from me. Lemon, lemon, lemon. YUM. The cake also tastes even better after a day of refrigeration.

I was looking for the ideal lemon cake, and once I hit this one, I knew it was THE cake to bake. My grandmother got us stuck in a snowbank this winter, and we had to call him to get us out with his tractor. I promised to pay him back in cake, and he asked if I could make lemon. I said, "Absolutely!", and immediately started searching. THIS IS IT!!! The cake I baked for the neighbor looked so good I decided to bake one for us. Frosting was excellent with fresh grated lemon in it. My grandmother screwed up the lemon filling by not following the directions to a T, but somehow it turned out, with a perfect curded texture, to boot. I completed the appearance of the layer cake by putting candy lemons on the outside of the top layer, making an outer ring, and then joined four in the middle, making a four-prong star. The frosting underneath I had swirled into delicate waves, and once complete with the lemon candies, was absolutely AMAZING!!! This one is staying in my recipe box forever.

The icing was wonderful and so was the icing, but I really didn't like the cake and am looking for a good homemade lemon cake recipe to replace this one. It turned out very dense and when I tried to layer the cake with the filling, it was so heavy the filling squished out!

I have made this recipe several times and every one with rave reviews.  For simplicity this time I made  the cake as a white premium box cake with 1 tsp vanilla added and then the curd and frosting.  It was WONDRFULLY fluffy and delicious!  The curd was perfect and the frosting was the exact amount of lemon and sweet.  Definately will make again.  Maybe as cupcakes with the curd piped in and frosting over for easter??

This recipe turned out great.  I added a little lemon extract to the cake mix since the recipe for the cake didn't include any lemon flavor.  The name of the recipe suggests that there would be too much lemon flavor, however the lemon was rather subtle in all layers, making for a great overall taste.  Be careful when assembling, as too much frosting will make the cake layers slide a little.

This cake and frosting was delicious! Extremely lemony but be very careful not to get any of the white part of the lemon peel in the frosting as even the tiniest bit of white gave the frosting a bitter aftertaste. I made this cake but used another recipe for the lemon curd filling.

I followed the idea from Cynleewat who reviewed this cake.  I loved the lemon curd and the frosting.  Overall I think it would have been better if the cake wasn't as dense.  Still a good recipe and I would use it again.

L-O-V-E the cake recipe...not so hot on the icing . It was way too runny when used. 
We did put lemon zest in the cake itself and use a cream cheese icing. this is now our official favorite cupcake batter!

I made this cake for my mother-in-law's birthday since lemon desserts are her favorite.  The cake itself was a tad bit dense, but otherwise was wonderful for flavor....not too tart, not too sweet.  I will absolutely make this cake again, but will maybe use cake flour next time.

terrible recipe....cake was dense & dry, filling was too gooey and soaked into the cake & was way too tart, frosting was good but once cake was refrigerated it hardened and made it hard to eat....won't be making this again.

My niece wanted a lemon cake for her birthday and I used this recipe.  WishI could post a pic of her eating it on here!  She went straight for the filling and saved the frosting for last!  We all enjoyed it.  Thanks for sharing.

This was one great cake Michele! I'll admit, due to lack of time, I used a boxed cake mix and proceeded from there. Others complained about the filling and icing being either too sweet or to tart. We found the flavors to be absolutely perfect. Will definitely be making this one again. Thanks!

This was very pritty cake and very good.  I my have done something wrong because the cakes were not high enough for me to make more then one layer but that was not that bad I just used the curd as one layer it turned out fine.

I made this cake today and for sure, it is time consuming but my husband and I both love it, so it was worth the time and effort.
We didn't think it was too sweet nor too lemony, we thought it was just right.
True, the layers don't rise much but when you split the layers and stack them the cake is plenty tall.
I followed the recipe to a degree.
I used bottled lemon juice for the filling and fresh lemon juice for the frosting. Don't know if that would have made a difference, but it has a great taste nontheless.
Thanks so much for this recipe.
It will satisfy all the lemon lovers out there.

This cake recipe was really refreshing!  The tangy lemon flavor is really a nice switch
from the usual chocolate and vanilla recipes.  I think of this as a great "Springtime Cake"!!

Made this cake at the request of my 8-yr old son for his birthday. While most of the kids liked the cake all of the adults thought the cake was way too sweet. The leftovers were thrown away. At the recommendation of several previous reviewers I increased the frosting by 50%, and I think that contributed to the problem. I think the cake probably would have been a lot better if there was more cake and less frosting. The individual parts of the recipe were good by themselves: cake, filling, and frosting, but when combined there was way too much sugar. I do not recommend.

I made this cake and it came out deliciously lemony! Loved everything about it. I did make the following adjustments per recommendations on this site:

1. Switched all purpose flour for cake flour as some people said their cakes were coming out too dense. It's true that this cake doesn't rise very much but I used dental floss (instead of a knife) to cut it in half and there was no problem. 

2. Doubled the frosting so I would have enough for a crumb coat before the final layer. I definitely had a ton of frosting left over. In the future, I would make 1.5x instead of 2x

3. I subbed 1/4 C of the milk on the filling for lemon juice

4. I misplaced my vanilla extract so I used almond extract instead which added a nice amaretto flavor

Other notes: I needed 6 lemons to get all the fresh lemon juice needed for the recipe. The filling is REALLY sticky and tough after it has been refrigerated for 3 hours. I might give it time to get a little closer to room temperature before working with it bc I had a hard time getting it to spread, it came out really yummy tho. 

I would definitely make this again.

I made the filling and frosting only.   After reading several reviews I decided to make the filling exactly as the recipe stated. I made a tiny alteration to the frosting adding a little vanilla that enhanced the frosting perfectly. Made a cake for 40+people and everyone raved about it!!    Yes I made a tiny change but nevertheless,this is a 5 star recipe for filling and frosting.

Very nice! 
I too, made a few changes, but have changed my opinion when people say they made changes. I've determined I don't want to take credit away from the original inventor. 
First, the process is listed in the wrong order if you're making your own lemon curd. Start this first, it takes hours for it to cool. 
The cake: I took an others suggestion and cut the milk down to 3/4C and added 1/4C lemon juice.  I also used cake flour.  (Next time I may add some Cream of Tartar for flavor.) 
Since I made my own curd, I beat the 4 egg whites  in to stiff peaks and gently added them to the cake batter at the end. 
Filling: I used all but 1/4 C of the curd in the center of the top cake and used 3/4 C of Fruit Only Raspberry jam in the bottom cake. 
Frosting: I made cream cheese frosting instead of buttercream, incorporating the 1/4 C of the curd, added 2 Tbls lemon juice, about 1/4 C sweetened condensed milk and 1/4 C sour cream, and used more powdered sugar.
I will definitely make this cake again.

Delicious! A lot of the curd oozed out. I think it'd be best to let it soak into the cake before fully assembling.

I made this today.  I followed the recipe and It was a dense cake, but not dry.  I didnt do any of the suggested changes. I wanted to at least try the original recipe once. I  find that most yellow cake recipes come out dense, just as this one did. If I make it again I will use the suggested cake flour and the 1/4C lemon juice and 3/4C milk. 
The lemon filling was good and the frosting as well. I only had 2 1/2C of C. sugar so I left 1 TBS of milk out. It was fine, its a simple butter cream frosting. 
Ive been on AR for many years, but I guess I hadnt logged in often enough, my profile is gone. I made a new one today.

The cake and filling are delicious but the frosting is HORRIBLE! I followed the recipe exactly and it never got passed the consistency of a glaze. If you use this recipe, don't use the frosting. Use your own.

The cake was very heavy only raised 1/2". Cake was so thin it was hard to slice in half for filling. I followed the recipe exactly!
What a waste of time and ingredients! I would strongly advise against making it. Never again.

My fiancee wanted a lemon cake with lemon frosting for his birthday and this hit the nail on the head! He was so happy with it and said he'd like to have it again. I definitely recommend making the filling the morning of or even the night before because it's a standstill waiting to be able to use it.

I made the mistake of not making the filling and putting more lemon in the cake batter to compensate.  It was too tart.  Next time I'm going to follow the directions exactly.

The title of the recipe is misleading.
It’s for  a VANILLA cake NOT lemon.
I had to add lemon extract to the cake batter!

The frosting and lemon curd (filling) came out great and very easy, however I read the cake recipe several times and could not find where it called for lemon to justify the "lemon cake" title with lemon filling and frosting . . . I have made better scratch recipes for the cake portion and will use them for this cake next time.  This was too dense for our liking.  I  likely mixed the ingredients it too much.  I forgot to take a photo :(

I followed the recipe to the letter, except I used lemon extract in the cake instead of vanilla extract. It was a lot of work, but my husband said it was my best cake yet! The sweetness of the cake and frosting offset the tartness of the filling perfectly.

This is cake is a hit whenever I make it.  To make it even more lemony, I use a half cup of milk and a half cup of lemon juice for the cake.  Needless to say, don't mix the two together, but I'll add the milk and mix, them half the flour, the lemon juice and then the remaining flour. I also use the zest of a whole lemon in the cake.
If I am making the cake, I will double the curd recipe but if I am making cupcakes (a wonderful option if you have a cup cake corer, available at most baking supply shops) I just make the recipe with the original quantities.  Everyone I ever make this for loves it and always asks for it again.

I followed the recipe to a T, and loved it but would make some changes next time. I would begin with making the filling, as the prep and cooling time of the filling is what takes the longest. From there I wouldn't change much other than doubling the frosting recipe. I wanted more frosting for in between the layers as well as some extra to decorate the top and sides. The cake was dense and delicious and everyone I served it to loved it.

Rating is for frosting only... Followed as written but used 1/4 cup lemon juice and all the zest from a very large lemon off the tree. If you are looking for a frosting with a lot of lemon flavor, this is it. I also added a 1/8 t salt to balance the sugar. Did not need the milk to get it the consistency I needed it. Made about 3 cups of frosting which put about a 1/4 inch layer on my 13X9 cake.

Gluten free, dairy free version —. Made with Kings Flour Gluten Free yellow cake mix (substitute cashew milk and Smart Balance margarine for milk and butter), add 1 teaspoon vanilla extract.  Frosting:  substitute Crisco “butter” flavor and cashew milk for butter and milk.  Made cupcake “parfaits” (see photo) — was a crowd pleaser both visually and in taste!  Awesome.

A moist, flavorful, lovely cake, not difficult to make (use Duncan Hines Comstock Original Lemon pie filling instead of cooking own). Height of three layer cake is very impressive with taste to match.  Thank you for this "keeper" recipe.

I have made this cake 4 times and it has never failed me. The cake always turns out light, fluffy, sweet, and moist, sometimes I would even just make this cake without the custard because it's so good. What can I say the custard hits the spot same with the icing, they both have great lemony flavours and they perfectly balance each other out. I would only make this if I had time, like on the weekends because it took me about 4h in total, but it's SO worth it.

Even though I took the advice of using cake flour the cake turned out pretty dry but overall the cake tasted good. Loved the lemon curd and frosting. This cake takes a long time to make and makes quite a mess but good for a special occasion. Will try to find a better cake recipe though.

When the cake was taken out of the oven it wasn't very tall. It only rose about 1 1/2". So I made the cake again and the same thing happened. I decided to use all layers because they were too thin to cut anyway. The filling never set properly, even though I followed the recipe and it sat in the fridge for about 5 hours. The whole thing was very time consuming and costly, which I don't mind if I had a nice cake. I will not even attempt this recipe again.

I made the cake only.  It was very dense.  The layers came out about 1 inch thick so I ended up doing another 1/2 of the recipe to get three layers and a decent height to my cake.  I wouldn't make it again.

good base. put 2 tbsp lemon zest in batter. used different curd recipe: 
1/2 c lemon juice and tbsp. zest heated 
whisk 2 eggs and 1/2 c sugar
SLOWLY add lemon juice to eggs mixed rapidly and constantly so they don't curdle 
strain back into pan. add 1 tbsp. zest, heat until thickened so whisk leaves marks stirring completely. remove from heat and whisk in 1/3 c butter in pieces. pour into bowl and let cool, then put in fridge to cool completely. 

start with 2 c. powdered sugar in frosting. add a bit more until right consistency/taste. more zest! (2 tbsp or so)

I made this cake exactly as the recipe reads. The flavor is amazing.  The only change I would make is to reduce the cook time. The edges were a little dry.  I will make again.

I was disappointed with this recipe. I also found the cake to be too dense and really thin. Lemon curd was not that great either. Maybe I overlooked it?  Was expecting fantastic, got ho hum. Will not make this recipe again!

I made this cake for my wife's birthday and she absolutely loved it and so did I .we will add to the lifetime recipe book.. I added extra lemon juice and extra lemon zest for the cake and the frosting. I also added 1 extra egg yolk in the lemon filling mix.  I used fresh lemons and squeezed them for the juice for optimal taste.

Just got the pans in the oven (not enough and very thick batter) already disappointed with this recipe. The ingredients list first off has repeat items and are not specified for which part of the cake they are for. And the first part of the directions dont specify amounts so it is up to you to read ahead and try and do the deductions yourself. I also did not have enough batter for two 8 inch cake pans. I filled one just over an inch and the other one about 3/4s. And very suprised no lemon juice or zest in the actual cake. I should have tried harder to find the lemon cake recipe I made my own last year for my wifes birthday. I had to modify it to my liking and it ended up similar to what this recipe is supposed to be like. I think next time I will use another cake recipe and maybe try the filling out if it ends up being any good. Sorry but this deserves a low rating for poor organization and possibly amounts. I will leave another higher rating possibly after the outcome. But I am fairly disappointed already

For me, not being a baker it was a little hard to follow the recipe. After I had finished the cake and tasted it the cake wasn't very lemony but on the other hand the filling was to lemony. Not one of the best I've had.

My issue with this recipe is how it's written. The ingredients are not separated for each item and not all subsections of the directions state the measurements for each part.  I was able to figure it out, but someone new to baking might have trouble. Other than that, the cake turned out great. I made candied Meyer lemons to garnish the top.

The cake is not actually lemon.  The filling is incredible though. I just added a tablespoon of lemon zest and a tablespoon of lemon juice to the batter. Delicious frosting. There didn't seem to be enough batter to cut each cake horizontally in half.

This is a great cake if you like lemon which my family does. I followed the recipe exactly. I did follow one persons advice for this recipe only bake the cake for 20 minutes or at least check for doneness at that time I think baking for the full 30 minutes would have made this cake to over done.  Also if you don't like to much of a lemon taste I would suggest to cut back on the amount of lemon juice for the frosting, you could really taste the tartness of lemon in the frosting the day after, but again if you are a lemon cake lover this is the cake to bake and follow the recipe to a tee you wont be disappointed. I will definitely be making this one again.

It was great! I've made this recipe 3 times now and it comes out perfect every time. Note: It does not make 12 servings like it says. It always ends up making less cake than I would like to eat. I usually double or triple the batch with no problem.

Changes: I always add zest to the cake batter because without it its a little bland.

I made this cake for Easter dinner with rave reviews.  I choose to fill it with a raspberry filling I found in another recipe, rather than the lemon filling here.  I'm sure that had some impact on the final product (like, I had to refrigerate it overnight after layering it together to get the raspberry gel filling I made to set, which made this not one of those whip-up-in-a-hurry kinds of cake).  I think the refrigeration had an impact on the dryness of the cake, but it was still amazing!  I would absolutely do the raspberry filling again, though - because it was delicious and was a wonderful blend of flavors.  

Here''s the other piece of advice I can offer:  DOUBLE THE FROSTING RECIPE!!  (Don't think twice about it, just do it - trust me.) The lemony tang is most prevalent in the frosting.

This is a special occasion cake due to number of steps, time and amount of sugar.  I made a few changes based on the reviews of others.  Made an extra half batch of cake batter so the layers would be easier to work with and instead of 1 cup milk I used 3/4 c milk and1/4 cup lemon juice.  Regular flour worked fine for me but I think you do need to beat the butter and sugar the 5 minutes called for in recipe to avoid grainy taste.  The lemon curd filling was amazing, I made an extra half batch and used it all.  Frosting also was great.  I made an extra half batch based on reviews but I didn't need it.  Used an extra tablespoon of lemon juice in frosting.  Don't skip the zest.  Use fresh lemons.  I froze my cake layers overnight and did not have an issue with crumbs messing up the frosting.  This is not a cake kids will love--the flavor was VERY strong but all of the adults loved it.

I loved this cake and will definitely make it again.  I changed the frosting and added 5% cream, which I do for all my frosting.   This meant I had to have 3 tbsp instead of 2 of milk.  I find butter frosting a bit on the sweet side, but the lemon in the layers cuts it back and makes it just right.  I agree with increasing the lemon by 1/2, but then I love lemon.  It's good the cake is basic.  I think adding lemon to the cake on top of the filling and frosting would be a bit much.  Overall a wonderful new addition to my cake recipes!

I used cake flour and the cake and bake it for 23 mins. I believe  the problem is not enough milk and the layers are to small. should not be baked no more than 15min. The filling turned out great as did the frosting . Will make again with another cake recipe, but will keep the filling and frosting

I wanted a really lemony lemon cake, and this recipe delivered.
My husband and I baked this together for a friend as our weekend cooking project.  Neither of us had baked anything or made a cake from scratch in years, and we were astonished at how well it turned out.  Not only was it a fully functional baked good (layers rose properly, lemon curd came together just fine in spite of our clumsiness) , it was  incredibly delicious!  The cake was buttery and soft, the filling was moist and zingy, and the icing was just the right amount of sweet.  It got rave reviews and was so good I'm looking for an excuse to make it again!  I added extra lemon juice and zest to the icing for more tartness.  It tasted so bright and fresh!
My only complaint is that the recipe was difficult to follow, at least on a phone.  It wasn't clear which ingredients pertained to which parts of the cake.  A little more care with the  writing, and this would have been an easy five star recipe.

We really liked it. A lot. It tastes like a lemon bar but without the heaviness of a lemon bar. However, mistakes were made and changes as well. I don't know if anyone else had trouble getting your cakes out of their baking dishes but I ended up rebaking the cakes for that reason. The second time we put wax paper on the bottom of the baking dishes, uped the vanilla, and added the zest of half a lemon. For the filling I increased the zest and juice (turned out great) and also strained the mixture to get out all of the clumps. For the frosting I uped the juice and the zest again for taste.

This is a lovely cake and, if made with cake flour, you will not have any heaviness.    Follow other directions exactly and also remember it does require more time to put together than most cakes. My only reason for a 4 star rating is the use of all purpose flour.

The cake came out flat, dense and not very tasty. We ended up using the frosting for a lemon box cake instead.

I made this for a friend's birthday. His favorite flavor is lemon, and he LOVED it! So did his entire family! I used justa white cake mix, and it still turned out fantastic! Tasting the frosting, and filling desperately I was a little worried because it didn't taste too sweet. But once it was all put together, it tasted perfectly sweet and lemony. Just the right amount of frosting!

I loved the taste of this cake! VERY lemony! The only drawback was the texture of the cake itself. It was a little dense and tough. It may have been that I used buttermilk instead of regular milk though and used lemon juice instead of vanilla flavoring. I also added a teaspoon of lemon zest to the cake batter.

This recipe is ok, but I think it needs improvements. For the actual cake, I added instant lemon pudding to add a bit of lemony goodness to it. The cakes are thin and a bit dense. Next time, I may try making more batter and doing things to fluff it up, like using cake flour and whipping the egg whites. As for the filling, the recipe makes PLENTY. It's delicious, but sort of runny; I had to stick it in the freezer a bit before spreading it. The frosting was a bit gritty, which I thought was weird. I also needed more. But overall the cake is tasty, just needs improvement.

I have made this three times and my family loves it. It is very lemony. I like the texture of the cake, though some may think it too dense. The only thing I did different is made a little extra frosting to be sure there was enough for a crumb coat (whic you definitely need) and for piping....

I added lemon juice to the cake and a little extra to the frosting, subbed flour for the cornstarch and it came out super tasty! I only let the filling set for an hour and a half in the freezer, stirring it every so often before I put it on the cake for times sake, it came out just fine. I was very happy with it and put a little on some meringues I had on hand from the egg whites (didn't wanna waste em), it was super tasty there too. My boyfriend's friends all loved the cake and demanded more when I made it for them

Oh my goodness this is a wonderful recipe!  It's bright, tart lemony goodness was a huge hit with my friends!  Thanks for this!  I will definitely be making it again.  *I used a jar of lemon curd instead of making the filling and substituted lemon extract for the vanilla in the cake.

I only needed the lemon frosting for some mini square cakes that I made - really liked it!  A little difficult to work with but thats probably because I'm a novice (at desserts) and don't know all the tricks, so I didn't factor that into my rating.  The flavor was great, especially after cakes were in the fridge and the frosting set.

The cake was lovely, and the filling to die for. I substituted about a quarter cup of milk for lemon juice in the cake to give it more of a lemon flavor. I opted out of the frosting, using the egg whites to make a meringue instead, for a less sweet finish. This is definitely a recipe I would make again.

this cake was really good! the actual cake recipe itself is really really good too and kind of like a pound-cake so i plan on using it for other cakes. the only problem i had was that this is a little sweet but after it sat for a few days it was as sweet. i might use less sugar in the icing next time anyways. other than that i really liked this and so did everyone else who tried it.

I had a few problems w/ this recipe.  I ran out of eggs so didn't make the filling & subbed a jar of lemon curd.  the cake was very dense & thin, so I didn't cut these in half, just used them as is & put the curd in the middle & covered all in the frosting.  My frosting was too thin & way too much.  Not pretty & just okay taste, won't be making again.

Overall this cake is outstanding.  The taste is intensely lemon, fresh, and not too heavy.  My only problem was that the cake seemed to be too flat.  I actually made the cake twice because the first one seemed so flat and I had used cake flour and margarine instead of AP and butter.  After the second go round it was still quite a bit flatter than I thought it should be but was a little better. I wonder if a good cake mix might be a better alternative???  Still glad I made it. It was probably the best lemon cake I've ever had.

This cake is VERY lemony. If you're into that, you will like this cake. I personally prefer sweet desserts and this was more tart than sweet, especially the filling. If I ever make this again, I will only use 1/4 cup of lemon juice and a 1/4 cup water for the filling rather than all lemon juice. The frosting was delicious however. Even that I found could've used a bit more sugar and less lemon. The cake was good, nothing special though. This is a good cake to make for those who dont have a big sweet tooth. I made it because I was tired of the same ultra sweet desserts and cakes, but I find that is what I like best.

I really enjoyed this recipe. The filling was a bit tart for my personal taste, so next time I will decrease the amount of lemon juice. I used this another person's suggestion and used the recipe to make cupcakes and I just put the lemon filling on the inside and frosted the cupcakes with the lemon butter frosting. The frosting was a little buttery for my taste so I fixed that by adding a bit of shortening and more powdered sugar to adjust. Came out great.

I made this cake for my grandma's birthday.  She loves lemon anything.  I will not be making this again.  The actual cake part had no flavor and a cake mix would have tasted better.  The frosting was ok but tasted like it was missing something. For all the trouble you go through this cake was not worth it.

Good cake but should not be called a lemon cake. I was afraid to add lemon to the cake mix because of what other reviews said. If I make it again I will add lemon to the cake mix add more lemon to the frosting and double the lemon curd and use it for all three filling layers.

Ok, I froze it and the frosting turned into a spreadable glaze and OMG! This cake is SO good, almost like I bought it!

I made this for my friend's surprise birthday party. It was a hit!
We made two cakes mine and one from a box and mine was gonna within minutes! Everybody loved it.
I didn't make the filling though, but I look forward to making this recipe with the filling next time!

I cheated a wee bit and used a packaged lemon cake mix but I did make the lemon filling and the lemon frosting and it was fabulous.  I had adults asking for seconds and one commented that she hadn't asked for seconds of cake since she was 10 (and she's 60 lol).

You have to like lemon for this cake, and I do.  Lemon 3 ways will make you pucker up and kiss the cook. The cake is moist, the filling does not leave a slimey feel in your mouth and who can resist buttered frosting.  Great for anyone that doesn't like overly sweet desserts because the lemon rounds out the sugars.

To be completely honest, I can't fully rate this recipe because I only made the cake...not the filling. 
The cake was so moist and delicious, but it had no lemon in it so I'm not quite sure why it was called lemon cake. However, it made a great vanilla cake.

Very lemony!!  This was soooo good!  My cake wasn't very thick for some reason so I didn't halve them b/c I didn't want to mess it up.  Still very good though!

The ONLY reason I didn't give this recipe all five stars is because I had such a difficult time keeping my layers aligned.  Things were so gooey, the layers kept sliding...I may blame the Houston heat!  Otherwise, incredibly yummy!

Good recipe.  I cheated and used a boxed cake mix with a box of lemon pudding.  I used the curd recipe and it was excellent as was the frosting.

I have to agree with the other reviewers.  I made this cake and it just wasn't very good (the cake portion) - so the next day I bought a vanilla cake mix, and made it again (using the cake mix as a substitute) and it was a huge hit - I will make again, but I will use a different cake recipe!

This cake is fabulous.  The filling makes it...I didn't have peel, so I used lemon extract.  I overcooked it a bit (accidentally), and it was still fabulous.  Thanks for the recipe

this was titled as a lemon cake, and yet it called for no lemon in the cake itself. i added about 2 tbsp of grated lemon zest, and it was unbelievable.  Great recipe

This cake is amazing!! Wow.  I've never made a cake from scratch before, nor have I ever made my own frosting.  What a difference! I will always make my frosting from now on.  Great recipe and much easier than I had expected.  Thanks!!

I followed another's advice and just made a white box cake mix. I made the curd and the frosting according to the directions. The curd was excellent! The frosting was a little too sweet for me, but my company loved it. All around, a good recipe. Thanks!

I read all the reviews and since so many were unhappy with the cake I just used a white cake mix and added about half teaspoon of lemon extract. For the filling I made microwave lemon curd (from this site) because I didn't want to separate eggs. If anyone else wants to use that curd make sure to add some cornstarch so it thickens. I didn't, and when I put the cake together it kept sliding off!!:)). Anyway, I used this frosting recipe, only subbing lemon extract for zest, and I added some yellow food coloring, and the cake was out of this world!! Tart and sweet, and soo lemony. It tasted like a cake from a bakery and was much simpler using a box mix and making the curd in the micro. I've never before thought a cake mix tasted like anything other then well, a box mix but this was outstanding.

I love lemon anything and I really liked the lemon curd.  The frosting had a nice lemon flavour but was way too sweet.  I absolutely hated the cake!  I found it dry and I did not like the texture at all.  I like a moist cake.  I found it very heavy.  You definetly need a drink of water with this cake.

Really yummy.  Due to my oven temp being faulty and possibly the conversion from tsp to g being off, this cake did not rise at all.  End result: really dense cake.  But as many have said before the filling and frosting were fab!  I even have enough left over to try for a 2nd cake.  :)

I loved everything about this cake except the curd. Other than that it was awesome. I loved the butter frosting and the cake was so soft and moist. This was the first cake I have ever made that wasn't from a box so I was pretty happy with it. Being as it was my first lemon curd as well, that could have been the problem! ha! I will try this again, but next time with a different curd recipe.

This was fabulous! I was in a hurry so I used a box lemon cake mix. I didn't cut the layers apart - I just used the filling in between the 2 layers and frosted the whole thing. It was the best! I'll definitely use this again!

I used lemon extract when I made the cake (I only used the cake part of the recipe) and the result was a very nice smelling and tasting product, terrific lemon flavour- but wayyyy too dense, is it supposed to be like that? I thought sponge cakes were supposed to be light and fluffy!

I cheated a little.I used a boxed lemon cake mix then followed your recipe instructions to a T. At first I thought the icing was too sweet but with the tartness of the cake it turned out beautiful. I served this following dinner w/ friends and not a word was spoken durning dessert. After all forks and saucers were handed over to the dish-washer (me) everyone raved about the cake. PERFECTION! Thank you for sharing.

Fabulous sweet & tart lemon flavors.  I found the filling difficult to work after it was refrigerated.  It was like spreading  dense glue.  Don't know what I did wrong.  Maybe cut the corn starch some.  Another viewer recommended store-bought Mrs. Robinson's lemon curd. Sounds like a good idea.  The cake isn't very tall but pretty nonetheless.

The filling is tart and the frosting is very sweet, but the taste sort of balances out when you eat them together.  I think I'll experiment a bit with the frosting next time. It's definitely one I'll add to my recipe box, though!

This was a wonderful cake!  The cake is moist and dense, and the flavors are a perfect balance of sweet and tart. Thank you for sharing such a treasure.

This was the worst cake I ever made- the cake was flavorless and the curd was WAY too tart (and it's hard for me to find lemon curd too tart).  The frosting was OK, but not great. I actually threw away the last half- I've never thrown cake away before!

Very moist and rich with the butter.  It was a birthday cake for me and I truly enjoyed it!

I enjoy cooking, but am no where close to an "accomplished" cook. I know mostly home recipes with a little of this or that, as I have basically taught myself to cook. However, I am presently working in Iceland and no lemon cakes are available. I found this one, cooked for my wife's bday. It was not a perfect looking cake, but my first "from scratch" cake was wonderfully tasty. 
THANKS TO WHOM EVER put it out there. My wife thought it was great from an exmarine turned pastor thanks to Jesus CHrist.
