I give this recipe four stars because it really helped me figure out what to do with ingredients that I already had.  I had some seasoned chicken fajita meat but I really wasn't in the mood for fajitas.  This fit the bill.  I ended up doubling the recipe and used one package of Knorr's Spanish Rice & one package of Knorr's Taco Rice.  I also removed the zucchini after cooking and set aside.  I added it to the rice after the rice was finished cooking.  (The thought of boiling the cooked zucchini just didn't sound appealing to me.)  My husband loves it, he took two servings, and I am hoping that it will taste even better tomorrow for lunch.

My entire family, husband, two daughters and 11 month son, loved this recipe. We do love mexican food and so really enjoyed all the fresh cilantro. The spanish rice made for a great vehicle to "hide" the zucchini. It was a quick, easy meal and I have added to our "frequent meal list".

I thought this recipe was just alright.  I don't think I'll be making it again.  My son did not care for it at all and he's liked most of the new recipes that I've been trying lately.  I did, however, like the sour cream mixed with cilantro.

Good.  Easy.  A nice way to sneak zucchini into a meal.  It is perfect with the cilantro sour cream.
