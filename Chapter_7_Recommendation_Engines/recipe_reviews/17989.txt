This was a wonderful recipe, but I see that many who reviewed this recipe no little about "tempering" raw egg.  Mix the eggs, sugar, and salt together first.  Heat your milk until it comes to a simmer.  Now take a little of the hot milk and add to the egg mixture, stirring constantly.  Do this a little at a time until your egg mixture is warm and close to the temperture of your milk.  Gradually add the egg mixture to the saucepan.  This should avoid curdling or "scrambled eggs" in your nog.

Just made this again!! There's no way to get 10 servings out of 2 1/2cups of milk, you have to double the recipe..I first warm the milk then add it slowly to the YOLKS and sugar(I don't use the whites!!) and cook it in a water bath, there's no way to get "scrambled eggs" (it will take a little longer to cook). I always add some cinnamon along with the nutmeg, it's always great!!!


**If you want eggnog that's not too thick ...like some people said... just use "light" cream, it's just as good!!
"Happy Holidays!!"

This was absolutely the best.  We live in Russia and can't get eggnog here.  This tasted just like eggnog from 'home'.  I really like the fact that the eggs are cooked.  This is best prepared the night before, by the next day, it is completely chilled and has an eggnog flavor rather than an eggy flavor.  5 stars

Delicious!! There is no need to temper the eggs like some reviewers suggested - just heat them along with the other ingredients as stated in the recipe. The purpose of tempering is to introduce cold eggs into a hot mixture - you slowly put a bit of whatever hot mixture you are working with into the eggs to gently heat them up so they do not "scramble" when you put the into the hot mixture. 

However, in this recipe, you are beginning with all cold ingredients and heating them together - you are not introducing cold eggs into a hot mixture and therefore tempering is not needed. If your eggs are "scrambling" in the eggnog, you are heating your mixture up too quickly. Turn the heat down a bit and SLOWLY warm your mixture up.

I made the recipe as-is (without the rum). Everyone loved the creamy texture, and I loved the fact that I wasn't serving raw eggs to my family. The eggnog was even better the next day! In fact, what little remained got even better as time went on. Next time, I will make a batch a couple of days before I want to serve it.

I loved the consistency.  Suggest whirling eggs, sugar, salt and milk in blender before cooking to avoid bits of cooked egg.

Pretty decent! Not too different from my Mother in Law's eggnog, which is to DIE for! A definite plus is the custard base since i'm pregnant and don't want to risk raw eggs, nor will I give raw eggs to my children. A much creamier, smoother egg nog than store bought, and worth the little time and effort spent.

What a waste of time and money. I'm so glad I tasted this before serving it to anyone. I had one little glass and the rest went in the garbage. I chose this recipe because I liked that I didn't have to use raw eggs. But with every sip I got a mouthful of little cooked egg pieces. If I had a strainer I might have been able to strain them out but unfortunately I didn't have one.

Yummy!  I wanted a great recipe that conained no raw eggs and this was it!  A few cloves and a cinnamon stick to the sauce pan were all the changes I made.  Oh, and I didn't have any rum or food coloring on hand.  Thanks, Carolyn!

This eggnog is delicious and easy to make. I noticed a lot of comments about the eggnog being lumpy. As I was making mine, I was very careful to avoid this by heating slowly. However, I did get lumps, but not because of needing to temper the eggs. As someone stated earlier, since the eggs & milk are both starting out cold, tempering is not necessary.

The reason for the lumps is that there is a very small window of time from "coating the back of a metal spoon" to lumps. I literally watched the lumps form because I cooked it for seconds too long. But, not to worry. I let the eggnog cool and before adding in the whipped cream mixture I simply used an immersion blender on it and the lumps disappeared in moments. Someone else also suggested putting the nog in a blender or food processor, which I'm sure would work equally as well.

As for the thickness, I doubled the egg/sugar/milk portion of the recipe, but only used the 10 serving portion of the cream/sugar mixture. It was not as thick, but made a wonderful consistency eggnog. I did not add the rum into the recipe as children were going to be enjoying the eggnog, but we adults added the rum into our servings. Everyone was happy and the eggnog was a big hit. I will continue to use this recipe, it's fabulous!

Oops, I almost forgot, I threw a cinnamon stick & 1 tsp. of ground cloves into the egg/sugar/milk mixture and allowed it to all cook together, removing the cinnamon stick before blending out my lumps.

I love this receipe, I usually double or quadruple it.  It is very very thick without alcohol or something to cut it.  I make it without alcohol and add it depending on who is drinking it!

This truly is luscious eggnog! The best way I can describe it is to say that it is like a light and fluffy liquid pudding. It's thick, but not heavy. It's amazing and the best eggnog I've ever had!!!  I followed the recipe exactly and it worked out great. I was only concerned when I tried folding in the whipped cream. The whipped cream just floated in the custard and did not want to fold in, so I whisked it in lightly and it turned out great.

OMG!! This eggnog is AMAZING! I live in the UK and you can't get eggnog in any of the grocery stores, so I've had to make it, and I LOVE this recipe, and so does everybody that tries it. The first night I made it, I followed the recipe exactly, but it went so fast that I tripled the recipe the next day, people keep raving about it, definite keeper. It's so easy to make, thanks so much for an incredible recipe. A few changes that I made, I added some scotch whiskey, and cognac as well as the rum. I also used double cream in place of the heavy cream.

Having never had homemade eggnog before, I can only compare it to store bought. I will never buy store bought again! It is time consuming, but so worth it. It is best if you make it a day or two before you need it because it is good the first day, but even better the following day. I added a little cinnamon and nutmeg to the egg mixture before heating. After reading the reviews, I decided to start on low and gradually increase heat until it was eventually on medium. No scrambled eggs for me, it came out perfect.

Divine.  My husband and I weren't sure how this would turn out, considering neither of us has made eggnog from scratch before.  No lumps of eggs.  We doubled the recipe and are really excited to take this to a family gathering tomorrow!

This is delish! I made 2 batches.  The first batch I made to the recipe.  The 2nd...well didnt turn out as well.  I used a mixer to mix it, and it made it chunky, after straining it it turned out fine.  Word to the wise just follow the recipe and you will never pay retail for eggnog again!

If you want SCRAMBLED EGGNOG, please feel free to use this. By the way, DON"T TURN IT UP TO MEDIUM HEAT, USE LOW!

This is about a year or two later... I just wanted to say that I'm so sorry for yelling on here but this recipe seriously scrambled the eggs! I was told by a family member that you do NOT want to use anything higher than low heat or else the eggs will basically cook themselves all the way through. I think I'll stick with that family member's recipe... (they make the BEST eggnog! It's literally to DIE for!! But they don't make it often.)

This eggnog was not only easy but is so delicious!  I love the fact that it is cooked because I am pregnant and have little ones.  We will definitely be making more because it went so fast!  The only changes I made were that I left out the rum, again because I am pregnant and serving children. I also left out the food coloring because I do not see the point.  Thanks for wonderful recipe!

This was tasty, but waaay too much work.  Impressively, my 12 year old made this herself, but it's not a recipe I consider easy and it certainly wasn't quick.  We like the Eggnog I recipe much better!

I did not think this was nearly sweet enough.  I will def at least double the sugar next time.  I picked this one b/c it called for the eggs to be cooked, as I was nervous about raw eggs.  It did get a little lumpy once I folded in the heavy whipping cream mixture, so I kept stirring until it was smooth.

The egg was so bad in it, I thought I sifted out all the scrambled part but I missed a bunch or it just turned chunky while it chilled. My husband also thought it was way to much rum (and he's in the Army and isn't afraid to knock back a few). If you venture to try this recipe, defiantly follow what the other reviewers said about cooking the egg but I think it would have been better raw.

turned out great! I stirred it the whole time it cooked and there were no lumps. It was perfect. If you dont stir it the whole time it cooks, then you will have lumpy eggy custard. Just follow directions. I used a ball whisk, which is almost my favorite cooking utensil in my kitchen.  Also I times it by 8....yes 8X so it took 45 minutes of stirring and cooking.

Absolutely fabulous recipe! I chose to omit the food coloring. Since the consistency was a little thicker than I was hoping for, I added a little more rum to thin the mixture. Wonderful! Next time I pan on pouring into our ice cream maker to make Luscious Eggnog Ice Cream. Thanks for the great recipe!

I gave this a low rating not on flavor but on texture.  I don't care for the "foamy" taste of the whipped cream mixed into the custard base.  I added whole cloves, a broken cinnamon stick and some bits of nutmeg to the custard while cooking, then strained them out for the cooling stage.  Overall...OK...still looking for that creamy (not foamy) recipe.

The taste is way too bland. Adding some nutmeg and cinnamon didn't help much. The heating process involved is somewhat tricky. I followed one reviewer's "egg-tempering" suggestion, but the mixture, after 6-7 minutes of stirring, just curdled up. By using immersion blender, I was able to rescue it. After cooling and blending in the whipped cream, the texture wasn't bad.

This has a really good taste, but it turned out really thick for me. I followed the advice of a review that said to simmer the milk first, and then slowly mix in the yolks. I only had a few "scrambled egg" clumps, but it was easy to pick those out. My husband and I ended up eating it with a spoon, as it was so thick. Maybe it's because I didn't add the rum?

I wanted to teach my grandson how to temper eggs but I don't think he got the hang of it, quick enough. ;o) We scalded the milk, added the sugar & salt & allowed it to cool for a few minutes before tempering the eggs (SHER1950 gives great step-by step instructions in her review so I won't repeat them). I think we may have also overcooked it. :o( I'm going to make another batch for New Year's (w/out my grandson's help) & follow the recipe.

Thank you BethR117! You saved my eggnog. I followed the recipe exactly but still ended up with lumpy custard. After reading your review I ran the hot custard through my kitchen blender then let it cool. It was perfect after adding the whipped cream . We'll be making this again and again!

This was pretty good. I thought that it could have had some more spices in it, cinnamon and maybe some cloves, but other than that it was a hit. I left out the rum, which could be why I wanted more spices, since I was serving this to kids. I will make this again but next time I'm going to add a cinnamon stick and some whole cloves to the custard mix while I cook it. I left out the food coloring as I didn't think it needed it. Made the custard the day before and let it sit in the fridge overnight. Thanks!

Made this with a few changes (apricot brandy instead of rum, cardomom rather than nutmeg) and it came out great. I do think I should have added one more egg though for a more eggy flavor, but all in all its a great recipe! My husband loved it so I'll definitely make it again!

I loved this recipe!  The only changes I made were to make it less calories/fat.  I used Splenda instead of sugar and instead of heaving whipping cream I broke it down and used 50% fat-free half and half and 50% whipping cream.  This made it not as thick.  My guests loved it!

This is a great recipe!  It was a little difficult for a fairly inexperienced cook.  I took me two tries to get it right.  The first time it got chunky, even with "tempering" the eggs.  The next time I did it I didn't cook it as long and it turned out really well.  I tried the recipe called "Amazingly Good Eggnog" last year because it was rated so highly, but it didn't taste much like eggnog to me and others at the party, and it didn't get consumed.  This one was a hit!  I did add more alcohol (rum and brandy); made the party a little happier ;)

MMMM so good!  I thought this was delicous, however my boyfriend didn't like it and refused to drink any after trying a sip (he said it just tasted like sweet milk)  To try and make it more pleasing for him I mixed in about 1/2 tsp allspice and nutmeg, but it still didn't work.  I followed the tempering instruction by Sher1950 and got no bits of cooked eggs.
This still gets 5 stars from me, despite what my crazy boyfriend thinks =P

I chose this recipe because it uses cooked eggs. I read what other had to say and tempered the eggs so they did not scramble. I loved the eggnog before the whipped cream was added and after I added the whipped cream no one would drink it all you could taste was cream even over the rum. I'm making it again tomorrow but will not be adding whipped cream to it. The eggnog itself gets 5 stars!

I added nutmeg, cinnamon, and cloves to the mixture while it was being cooked. After I let the mixture cool, I strained it to get rid of the bits of eggs and clumps of seasoning. This was the best eggnog I've ever had, and all of the people at the party that I brought it to enjoyed it as well.

This was GREAT!  My husband loved it.  I tasted it before I put the nutmeg in it and I was a little iffy about it, but once I added nutmeg (I'm guilty of mixing it in instead of sprinkling it on top) it was wonderful!  Two thumbs up!

This is wonderful.  I wanted to make eggnog with cooked eggs (didn't want to risk getting sick on a holiday) and this recipe is delicious and easy to make.  It's so rich it reminded me of an ice cream drink.  Everyone loved this!

Pretty good recipe, even without the alcohol.  It was a little rich, but I guess it's supposed to be.  I like the fact that the eggs are cooked.

I followed Sher1950's advice for tempering the egg yokes ( I eliminated the whites and used them for an asparagus omelet). I also doubled the recipe and eliminated the alcohol. Mixture can be churned and frozen for ice cream.

This recipe is awesome! I blended the egg, salt, sugar and milk in a blender before I put them in the sauce pan. I also followed another viewers advice when cooking the milk mixture, I started cooking on low and gradually moved to medium heat, no higher and when the mixture coated the back of the spoon I removed the pot and immediately put it over ice. It came out perfect and tastes better then next day.

The only change I made was adding a half teaspoon of cinnamon to the custard while cooking. I did this because I like cinnamon. The rest was done as written. It came out perfectly delicious and smooth.

I was skeptical when I first tried it because it had not completely chilled and it had a "eggy" smell. After letting it sit overnight, it turned out WONDERFUL. I didn't have heavy cream so I used thawed cool whip.

The flavor or the custard was good but once you added the vanilla and folded in the whipped cream the flavor of the egg is lost and I personally love original eggnog, plus to me it just tasted like whipped cream

I made this without the rum and was very happy with the outcome. This was the very first time I have ever made my own eggnog and I am certainly going to continue to do so with this recipe. I will however have to triple the recipe because it did not last long at all. Thank you for sharing this!

I have been making this recipe every Christmas for several years, but with some changes.  
      However I don't do step 2.  Instead of beating the cream and making the egg nog with whipped cream, I just pour the cream into the custard.  I tried it with whipped cream and I like it better when it's smooth and creamy instead of so frothy.
     It's very important to follow the instructions exactly, don't overcook it.  
     To keep from getting bits of cooked egg in the egg nog, put the eggs, sugar and salt into the pot before you turn the burner on.  As soon as you turn the burner on, start whisking or stirring the milk into the eggs, keep gradually adding milk and keep stirring as it cooks until it coats the back of a metal spoon.  It takes constant stirring or whisking but the result is worth it!

I've made this recipe every Christmas for the past 5 years. I only use egg yolks. I mix the yolks and sugar with my hand mixer till fluffy, slowly add warm milk. Then i add everything back to the pan can cook till thickened.  I dont use rum or food coloring.

AMAZING. Made exactly as written and followed the review about tempering the eggs first. My kids couldn't stop raving about it. The texture is like pure dreamy fluff and the taste is out of this world. This is my favorite new recipe.

This was great! Not too sweet, a little time consuming, but worth it. I used skim milk and heated it in the microwave, adding it slowly to the egg/sugar mixture, then heated on med-low heat. I used 1 1/2 tsp rum extract (for the double recipe) instead of rum. I doubled the recipe to make just over 1/2 gallon. I still need to cut it with milk because it is too thick for me - so next time I will try half-half.
