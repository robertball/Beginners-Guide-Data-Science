I have never seen my husband eat so many vegetables in one sitting.  I did change a few things to make it easier (less dishes) and lower fat:
-saute onions in 1/4 cup butter and just toss in croutons (I used Stove Top suffing) with that.  Cuts the fat in half
-saute the onions in the casserole dish you will bake it in

Okay we liked this with a few changes and 1 item I totally forgot. First of all I forgot the onion (oops), I used 2 cans of carrots (for ease), I did not use the stuffing mix, instead added 1 cup of plain bread crumbs in the mix and added another cup to the top with  melted butter so it would crisp. This is a good recipe to tailor to your families tastes. Thanks for the submission =)

Just made this recipe yesterday for a Thanksgiving dinner.  It was a big hit.  Everyone really enjoyed the flavours.  I did apply the tip to use half the amount of butter and add the stove top dressing mix to the sauteed onions.  Worked like a charm!

I made this for a harvest pot providence we had at church and it was wonderful. I used stove top stuffing and doubled it to fit in a 13by9. A friend of mine even asked for the recipe. I would recommend this to anybody and I would like to make it part of our Thanksgiving meal every year.

I made this for Thanksgiving. My family really didn't like it, don't think I will make it again.

I fixed this for Easter dinner and was very pleased how it turned out.  I was looking for something different to fix and this fit the bill.  I will make this again!
