Delicious! Super healthy and this makes HUGE servings, granted, my head of cauliflower was slightly large. I made this exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing. This is easily customizable to personal preferences. I bet some feta would be tasty too! I'll definitely be making this again! I used the blender jar of my Ninja to "rice" the cauliflower and it worked perfectly. Just a couple pulses is all it took.

Made almost as written and it's a hit! Absolutely delicious. The only change I made was omitting the olives because the main dish had olives in it and hubs is somewhat finicky about olives as it is. Used as a side to Moroccan Meatballs from a different website. We'll definitely be making this again, and hopefully with the olives. Thanks for the recipe.

This was pretty good. My daughter, who normally likes cauliflower, did not care for it. My son, who normally doesn't like cauliflower, loved it. My husband thought it was regular couscous. I found it filling, a great alternative to a carb. We really like cumin, so I substituted it for the thyme and I added shredded carrot to the veggies. Will make it again with some alterations to try to win my daughter over.
