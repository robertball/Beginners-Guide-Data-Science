Wonderful biscuit with a subtle kick from the red pepper flakes! It's also a great way to use up some Bisquick. I increased the red pepper flakes to 1 tsp. and added and 1/4 tsp. of Italian seasoning. I also used low fat buttermilk instead of milk. I brushed the garlic butter onto the biscuits before and after baking. These baked up beautifully and tasted great!

Excellent biscuits.  Nice and moist.  I accidently added all the garlic powder in the mix so in the end we only brushed on plain butter.  Still very yummy.  I had about 1/3 cup swiss cheese I had left over from another recipie, so I added that and 2/3 cup cheddar, to make one cup.  Very Good.  The only thing I would change is the amount of red pepper flakes.  I coundn't see or taste them. I would add at least 2 teaspoons (probably more though)  My kids (3 and 8 years) had no problem eating them as the recipie stated.  I just want a more red pepper flavor.

These biscuits are very easy and good too. I followed the advice of other reviewers and increased the red pepper to a heaping teaspoon, and I'm glad I did as they are not too spicy at all. I also used a mix of mozzarella and cheddar, added a bit more garlic powder, and a teaspoon of Italian seasoning blend. These are very savory and are great with soup or stew. I do recommend adding the Italian seasoning as it really brought out the other flavors. I will use use this again, thanks (:

This is a very good recipe! My husband and I love Red Lobster's biscuits, and these are a great way to have them at home. I have made them according to the recipe, but also tried a variation to go with spaghetti when we didn't have Italian bread. I added Italian seasonings (kept the garlic), and substituted mozzarella for the cheddar. I then used olive oil instead of butter. Yum!

Followed other suggestions and was very generous with the garlic powder and red pepper flakes.  YUM!!!  Good even after they cool, but best when piping hot from the oven.  Thanks for posting!

A new take on the classic Bay Biscuit. We love these with soup, they are just so different, yet really yummy with the addition of heat in the chili pepper flakes. Next time I will try adding garlic powder as I imagine they would be quite good!

Very good. I just eyeballed the red pepper flakes and garlic. This was the redeeming part of dinner tonight. Used more butter than indicated in the recipe. Will make again.

Biscuit perfection. I used buttermilk as suggested by others and onion powder instead of garlic (I was out). Thanks for the recipe:)

These are nice biscuits.  They look very pretty.  I put in 1 tsp of red pepper flakes, 1/2 tsp black pepper, 1/2 tsp oregano, 1/2 tsp salt, and 1 tsp garlic powder.   Then I put a sprinkle of garlic powder in the melted butter as well that I brushed on before baking.  And then I brushed them with plain melted butter after baking.  I baked at 420 degrees for 12 mins.

Easy to make and a welcome change from bland plain biscuits.  I made them as written, but next time I'll turn up the heat a bit and double the red pepper.

These were good-they reminded me of the Cheddar Bay Biscuits at Red Lobster.  However, I didn't find the addition of the red pepper to change the taste much.  If I made these again, I would probably add a little more.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  The only thing that I changed was that I added all the garlic powder to the mix instead of brushing on top with the melted butter.  Served with Sweet and Spicy Grilled Ham Steaks from this site.  Thanks

I made half of this recipe to try these out.  As some other reviewers suggested I doubled the red pepper flakes (1/2 t. in my half batch), and I also added some sliced green onion tops for a little extra color.  Otherwise I followed the recipe.  These were very good and easy to put together.  My only objection is that these biscuits were really big, bigger than I would have liked.  I’ll definitely make them again, but will make them smaller.  Good little recipe!

Was expecting to taste more of the red pepper & garlic but they were just really cheesy buttery.  If I make these again I would double the red pepper & garlic.

Good recipe! I made them into bite size balls and cooked for 10 mins with just a touch of golden brown on them...not as dry. Just the right amount of heat (mild). Next time I will add more cheese!
