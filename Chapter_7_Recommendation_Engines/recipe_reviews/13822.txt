This is a truly outstanding recipe.  Both my MIL and FIL are diabetics.  I did not use quite all the juice, but otherwise it is thee most perfect apple butter I've ever made!  Just the right amount of "spices"!  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  I will be making this for years to come!!

This is the first time I have made apple butter and it turned out perfectly. I could not find dried apples w/o sulfur (I live in a small town) but the ones I used worked great. I used half organic cider and half organic sparkling apple juice because it was what I had on hand. I used exactly the amount of spices that it called for. It was wonderful! It made 4 jars of apple butter. Before I blended it I thought it would be too runny because there was a lot of juice, but once blended the consistancy was perfect!
Very easy and delicious!!
Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is so easy and makes the whole house smell wonderful! I plan on making this my food gift of choice this Christmas. It does last forever in the fridge, and since it has no added sugar, it makes it a bit healthier than the usual onslaught of Christmas biscuits!
