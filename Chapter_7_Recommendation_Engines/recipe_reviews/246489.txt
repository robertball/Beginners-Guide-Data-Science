Pretty good recipe I dont think Ill make it again. Not that it wasnt good just I prefer pasta without potatoes (too many carbs) and wasnt saucy enough for my liking. I think I will stick with traditional bolognese sauce. Thank you for the recipe though and I would recommend this for anyone who wants to try something different.

I LOVED IT!!!! My 7 yr old found the carrots and potatoes off-putting but after a few times, I think she'll get used to it. It takes like regular spaghetti for the most part. I always cut pasta amounts in half. It was perfect that way.

Yum!  I put turmeric in anything I can, but never thought of cilantro in spaghetti sauce. Very fresh tasting. My only substitution was to use soy crumbles instead of beef. Not only delicious, but an anti-inflammatory bonanza! Thanks for the recipe.

Though I didn't follow the recipe exactly, I never thought of putting turmeric in spaghetti sauce. I had some fresh turmeric root to use so I grated one in.  I've never put potato in before either but it was a great thickener. I added fresh Rosemary and Basil . It was Awesome! Ty for sharing.

This one is a keeper with requests to have it in the regular rotation. I substituted fresh basil for the cilantro and Italian seasoned ground turkey so therefore omitted the Italian seasoning. I picked a nice red potato which worked nicely.

I'm glade you liked it. I'm not one to follow recipes exactly either! The fresh rosemary and basil sounds really good, that I will try using them on my next sauce.
