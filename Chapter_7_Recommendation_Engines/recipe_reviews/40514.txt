I made this for lunch one day for my daughter and her 3 year old.  We all loved it.  I made my own mac and cheese ahead of time and then reheated when ready to put together.  It was fast, simple and delicious.  Thanks for posting this one.  Will make again and again. Marty

Very good!  My fiance and I loved this and it was so easy to make.  Added a little more than 12 oz of mac and cheese and also used pre-packaged bacon crumbles and it turned out great.  Will make again!

This was really delicious and simple to make. I did change things just a bit by sprinkling the bread crumb mixture on the tomatoes AFTER I filled them with the mac & cheese. I'll definitely be making this one again.

These were excellent.  I have eaten stuffed tomatoes all my life with rice inside.  I don't know why I never thought of this...

This turned out very well, though I will need to use bigger tomatoes next time. Also, I will fill the tomatoes with the mac and cheese before the breadcrumbs, although the recipe recommends otherwise.

I've always loved mac & cheese (Stouffer's or my homemade) with tomatoes on top, then sprinkled with bread crumbs. So, for the heck of it, I tried this recipe today.  After thoroughly hollowing out the tomatoes, I found that after baking, the juice from the tomatoes really watered down the cheese sauce.  It was okay, but I much prefer it baked in a dish with big slices of tomato on top!  Just the right balance of tomatoes to mac.  Thanks.
