This was really good, and extremely kid friendly but there are a few things to point out. Having read a few reviews that said was dry, I only cooked it for about 20 minutes. Everything in it is cooked already, all you really need it for it to heat through. Also, sour cream is a fantastic addition and we felt it really made the dish. It should really be part of the ingredient list. Next time I'll probably double the recipe since we barely have leftovers for one night, my husband had seconds!

**Update. I made this again and doubled the recipe. I baked it for 30 minutes which was just barely enough to get it warmed through, but the top was starting to crisp. Next time I'll probably do 20 minutes covered and then 20 more uncovered to keep the top from burning. Just as tasty the second time around!

Never would have thought that something so simple would be so tasty. I did add about  2 tbs sour cream to the mixture and I chopped the bell pepper very fine. I liked it but I thought it needed a bit of seasoning, hubby wasn't too crazy about it. I think if I make it again I will add 1/2 lb of ground meat and that might be what will make hubby happy!

Extremely kid/family-friendly as written. I agree with many other cooks that as written , the casserole turned out a bit dry. I would add two cans of chili. As an experienced cook, I knew that I'd have to tweak the recipe to please our grown-up palates. I added two chopped Roma tomatoes, used sharp Cheddar and pepper jack cheeses, 1 can drained and rinsed black beans (Hormel Chili was without beans), 1 1/2 tsp. ground cumin and a few sprinkles of cayenne. I also cut the macaroni down to 6 ounces. Even with my changes, I'd use two cans of chili to relieve dryness issue. My husband likes chili mac lunches so I will be making this again. Add a nice crispy garden salad and you have a good, satisfying meal. Thank you, Hormel, for the inspiration!

I make this all the time but with a couple of changes. Saute the bellpeppers so they don't end up being crunchy and don't use ChiChis.  I tried it and it tastes  sweet and vinegary at the same time. Ruined my whole dish. I use Pace now.

Excellent recipe... easy and very tasty; my whole family enjoyed it. I did make some changes based on what I had on hand... I had no macaroni pasta, but I did have a package of Kraft dinner that I wanted to use up, so I used that in place of the pasta portion of the recipe. I was low on cheese, so was hoping the package of "cheese" powder would be adequate for the flavour. I used about 2 cups of leftover home-made chili with beans, and only a cup of salsa, as the chili was runny enough. I omitted the green pepper as there was green pepper in the chili. I threw in about a half a cup of packaged grated nacho-blend cheese, topped it with another half a cup, baked until bubbly, and everyone gobbled it up! I'll definitely be making this again... this is a good example of a dish being more than the sum of it's parts... so simple but SOOOO tasty! Next time I'll likely try it with the macaroni pasta as per the recipe, and also I'll double it, as it made just barely enough for the 4 of us.

This is a AWESOME recipe! 
My boyfriend and I made it last night because I wanted mac and cheese and he wanted chill, so we compromised! 
Also, we added a pound of hamburger and that made it even better and more filling! Also, you could always use a little more cheese! I definitely recommend making this recipe!

I made this last night and the whole family loved it! Made it just like the recipe except I doubled it. We ate it with sour cream and a little cilantro on top. I will make this again for sure because it is a quick easy comfort food meal that everyone loved (especially my husband and son). Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

Great recipe and very yummy! Made some adjustments: 2 cans of chili w/ no beans, 2 tbsp of sour cream, 2 tbsp of jarred chopped jalapeños instead of bell peppers, Mexican Blend cheese instead of Jack Marble cheese, and Pace Salsa (mild). All in all turned out great. Oh and also doesn’t need to cook for 30-35 mins either. I cooked it for 20 mins uncovered and came out perfect.

This was really tasty...after reading reviews, I made the following changes - I sauteed the green pepper with some onion before adding it. I used a Mexican cheese blend.  I also substituted Pace Salsa (mild).  It was a hit with my family and I will definitely make this again!

Yep.  That is chili mac.  Sometimes chili mac is what a person wants though and this is quick, easy, and fulfills the craving.  I did add some browned ground sausage and some onion as well as a second can of chili.

I also changed it a bit.  I sauteed 1 onion and 1 green pepper then added 1 pd of beef and a little chili powder to the beef mixture.  I tripled the noodles and added 1/3 cup of sour cream to the pasta mixture.  After mixing everything together I cooked it an a 9 x 13 pan for 2o minutes before adding the top layer of cheese.   After adding the top layer of cheese place it back in the oven till it melts.

loved this.  Followed suggestions to add 1.lb browned ground beef.  Also used the cheese sauce from the Mac n Cheese package.  Followed everything else exactly and it did not come out dry at all.  Definitely will make again.

Like everyone is saying, it's a good starting point. I browned half-ish pound of ground beef, half an onion and only half the green pepper. I mixed in a can of Rotel tomatoes, and used Mexican blend cheese instead of Coby Jack. Top with sour cream. My fiance is eating it out of the casserole dish!

We really liked this as a base - just a few tweaks and it will be an easy go to meal for us on a busy worknight. I would add at least 1/2 a pound of ground beef and cook the bell pepper with it (and we preferred the flavor of red bell instead of green). We used 1 cup of salsa instead of a full up and thought that amount of "sauce" was about right. Overall very happy with this recipe from Hormel!

I used ground turkey, whole wheat macaroni, cheddar by accident, and chili beans in chili sauce. Terrific! I imagine the original recipe is just as good.

Meh.  Pretty good, but I would've liked more chili and less macaroni.  Also, more peppers.  We made it with chili that had no beans.  Using chili with beans might have helped too.  Not bad, but not great.

Made it as stated with the addition of ground beef.  It was way too spicy for us.  Definitely needed the sour cream to cool it off. 
Too bad !

We enjoyed this. Super easy to to throw together for a busy family. I did not add the bell pepper, as we are not a fan. Baked in individual ramekins so cooked for only 20 minutes.  Topped with a dollop of sour cream and green onions!

Not bad for such a simple recipe.  I didn't have elbow macaroni so I used small shells.  I couldn't find Chi Chi's salsa so I used Pace Thick and Chunky salsa.   I served it with a dollop of sour cream on top.  Husband loved it and wants me to make this again!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was such a simple dish to prepare and quite delicious! I didn't add the bell pepper as I didn't have one in hand, and I'm sure would add great flavor! This will be a handy recipe to have on hand when busy football practice evenings resume in the fall!

Five stars for quick, easy and economical.  Three and a half stars for flavor and consistency.  I thought the chili powder was a bit overwhelming and next time I would cut back a bit.  It was a bit on the dry side, as well.  I think the suggestion by a previous reviewer to add some sour cream would help with the consistency and flavor.  Thanks for sharing the recipe, Hormel!

What a wonderful comfort food casserole that can feed a house full of people.  I have always loved what we called "Chili con Carne" served over elbow macaroni....this recipe takes that to a whole other level!  I served it with cheddar, bacon, and chive corn bread biscuits!

This dish was DELISH! Simple & so tasty. I added a tablespoon of sour cream (via other reviews) & baked covered for 20 minutes uncovered for 5. I also made honey corn bread mini muffins on the side. It was the icing on the Mac n cheese chili cake. This will definitely be a quick go to dinner option in my house. One thing my teenage daughter mentioned that she didn't care for was the crunch the green peppers had. She said she would have liked it better if the peppers were cooked a little more but, I thought it would work either way & it didn't stop her from having seconds. This is a great recipe

I am not even a macaroni and cheese person, but I love this! I just couldn't imagine chili and beans being in my mac and cheese, not to mention salsa and chili powder! But it all works and tastes great. I tented the dish for 20 minutes but removed the foil for the last 5 minutes. Perfect!

This is an easy to put together meal with great flavor.  We thought it was a nice change to the usual mac 'n cheese.  I followed over reviewers' advice and added a dollop of sour cream and baked it covered because we prefer a creamier mac 'n cheese.  I also added a little sautéed onion.

Super quick to put together, tastes great, and I baked it for about 20 minutes--just to melt the cheese and heat everything through well. My kids devoured it, and I enjoyed it also.

I garnished with black olives, sour cream and salsa. I found the noodles to be too soft when I served it.  Next time I will not cook the noodles for the full time prior to baking.   Overall good flavors.
