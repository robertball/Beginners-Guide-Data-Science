Very good recipe! I've made this dish a few times and never disappointed. I deducted one star because I think that the recipe is made better by substituting in rice vinegar for white vinegar and adding one tablespoon of toasted sesame oil.

I make this regularly and always get requests for the recipe.  I never bother with the chow mein noodles but use double the almonds.  I usually just need 1/2 recipe for a meal at home (and still wind up with a little left over).  I've used it with spinach and chard also, it's always yummy!

This is a delicious recipe!  This is the first time I have used BABY Bok Choy - it was tender and delicious (the large bok choy is more tough and better cooked).  I was muching on the leaves - so tender and wonderful flavor, you can use practically every bit, stems and all.  The dressing was delicious.  I used low-sodium soy sauce and half a bunch of green onions, as mine were huge.  I would recommend either doubling the salad or halving the dressing, as it made a lot of dressing.  Also, better eaten right away because the noodles get soggy by the next day (maybe sprinkle them on top and don't mix them in?).  Thanks so much for sharing!

I couldn't find baby bok choy so I had to use regular bok choy, and used tarragon vinegar rather than plain white vinegar, and this was so delicious!  A very different flavor which was a nice change from "regular" salads.  I will try harder to find baby bok choy as I think this salad would be even better with it.  Update:  I make this often but I use romaine lettuce which we've decided we like better than bok choy.  Sometimes I add canned mandarin orange slices which makes this salad even YUMMIER!  Also, I serve the chow mein noodles "on the side" so they don't get soggy.

I've never eaten bok choy before. I chose this recipe for our first taste of bok choy, and we both really loved it. Easy and tasty. The second time I made this I used toasted pecans instead, because I prefer them.

This is a fabulous treat. The various textures make it a delight to eat and the colors and variety of ingredients lead to a pretty plate. I didn't have any white wine vinegar so I used Sake instead along with a few teaspoons of regular vinegar. I also cut the green leafy sections of the bok choy into strips. I cut the white staulk into long rectangles and then I sliced the rectangles diagonally into spears.

Delish.  I tweeked.  I'm not sure what constitutes a "bunch" of baby bok choy.  I purchase baby bok choy heads in a bag at my asian market, usually 6-9 per bag depending on size.  I was only serving 3 people so I used 6 baby heads, 3 green onions. For a bit of color I added 3 sliced radishes and 1 fresh ear of sweet corn kernals. I adjusted the dressing as well.  1 T oil, 1 T rice vinegar, 1 T soy sauce and a smidgen (using those cute little measuring spoons) of powdered  stevia instead of sugar. I added the onions into the dressing while I chopped the salad and tossed it all together when ready to eat. I served this as a side with lo mein.

Very tasty, Since I anticipated leftovers, I added the chow mein noodles to each portion to prevent sogginess.

This is a really good salad that takes well to scaling/substitutions/additions.

I scaled down the dressing to 2 Tbs olive oil, 2 Tbs rice vinegar, 1 Tbs sugar, and 1 Tbs soy sauce. And I used 3 heads of baby bok choy. I also added half of a long cucumber cut into disks and substituted regular onion, minced, instead of the green onion. AND I added a  little left over pasta. It turned into a great summertime lunch :)

I used Sesame Oil because someone suggested that it has a "more authentic" taste.  And I agree! This is a great tasting slad.   I add chicken fried with hoisin sauce, & mandarin oranges and it becomes a very healthy lunch! Thanks for the recipe.  :)

Everyone in our family loved this salad! I did change a few things out of  necessity, to use ingredients I had on hand. I also only made half of the dressing. My changes were: Canola oil instead of olive oil. Balsiic vinegar instead of white vinegar. Ramen noodles instead of chow mein noodles and I toasted these and the almonds in about 2 to 3 TBS. of butter lightly in small frying pan. And I also added a few TBS. of sesame seeds.Delicious!

Great salad with some tweaking.  I altered the recipe slightly. I used baby bok choy. I substituted rice vinegar for the white vinegar. I added celery and sunflower seeds. I used Rice noodles instead of chow mein (I like the extra crunch) and I added crasins. This is a favorite. Everyone always wants the recipe!!!!! SO GOOD!!!!

Wow, this is just terrific! We had bok choy in the garden so tried this on a whim. We subbed Splenda for the sugar and doubled the almonds instead of using chow mein noodles. I do suggest cutting the dressing in half -- there was a ton left in the bottom on the bowl. My mouth is watering just thinking about this salad -- I may need to make it again today!

I love this salad.  I've made several revisions for our likes.  I add a little honey and lime juice to the dressing and refrigerate it so it thickens up.  I also grill a chicken breast with lemon pepper and a little lime juice to add to the salad.  Then slice up shitake mushrooms & a pear apple and some bell pepper.  We eat this as an entrée a few times a week switching up the toppings.    5star!

This recipe deserves five stars just for the dressing.  Simply delicious.  I actually just had this dressing with just the bok choy, none of the other stuff.  And I used regular bok choy as that's what I had but it's not bitter at all.  I scaled the recipe down to one serving.

This is a great salad!  It's a refreshing break from ordinary lettuce salads.  I halved the dressing recipe and only used 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon of sugar.  I added some pieces of orange as well. I forgot to add the green onions, but we didn't miss them.  I had no idea baby bok choy could be so tasty! Note:  I made this a second time and put the dressing on about an hour before we ended up eating.  It was seriously soggy.  So dress it just before you're gonna eat it.

This recipe is great, but I made modifications to make it healthier. I only used 1/4 sugar and used apple cider vinegar and ommited the chow mein noodles. I used dried apples instead. I also used regular bok choy instead of baby bok choy bc that is what I could find.My husband and I  loved the recipe. Couldn't get the kids onboard though. ( 7 pts. with Weight Watchers)

i probably shouldnt be rating this recipe since i changed it, but still the basics of it is excellent!  great flavored dressing!  i used just enough romaice lettuce and ramen noodles for 2 servings so nothing was leftover for fear of getting too soggy.  addicting dressing!  just remember, a little bit goes a long way though.
thank you!

Very good recipe provided you follow some of the changes suggested by others (sesame oil instead of vegetable oil - reduced to 3 to 4 Tbsp, lower the sugar to 1 Tbsp). I also substituted peanuts for the .

I love this salad. The Bok Choy is crisp to the bite and has a slight "nutty" taste. I used 2 tablespoons Splenda instead of sugar in the dressing. The dressing was light and a perfect complement to this salad. (I served mine with Mandarin orange slices and crumbled Feta cheese.)

Delish!!!!!!!!!!  MEGA 5 stars!  Easy and delicious! For 2 baby bok choys- I 1/2'd the dressing and it was still a little too much- I'd cut the oil down even more.  I added craisins to this and it was AWESOME!  Thanks for this!  I make it all the time now!

Wow this was delicious! I was skeptical, but it was great! I made it exactly as written, except with a full size bok choy (from my CSA box), and it was perfect. Next time I may up the amount of almonds, they were scarce. Mmmmm this salad was slightly sweet, crunchy, a little salty, fresh, and delicious! I served it alongside some fried tofu chunks with a peanut dipping sauce for a full meal.

SO simple and yet still more fancy than regular green salad.  I couldn't get the chow mien noodles so had to leave those out, but DON'T LEAVE OUT THE TOASTED ALMONDS!!!  The toasted taste of the nut with the bok choy seemed like they were created to be eaten that way!  Took advice from other reviewer and added dried cranberries and it was perfect!

Very good salad!  I usually add a partial packet of seasoning from a Ramen noodle pack to the dressing.  It gives some extra flavor.  I also use Napa cabbage instead of bok choy on occasion.  Both are good.

"This is definitely the best salad you've ever made!"---my carnivore husband.  Just made this tonight and it was a HUGE hit;  nothing left for me to take to work tomorrow!  I made a few changes only because I didn't have enough bok choy;  I added a seeded, chopped cucumber, and used thin slices of 1/4 of a red onion (didn't have green onions, either).  Halved the oil, but everything else the same.  Will be making this on a regular basis since it gets greens into my DH!  Thanks!!!

Really yummy salad! I didn't have baby book choy and used regular bok choy instead and it worked great! One thing is that the dressing recipe makes a large quantity and it goes a long way... The portions could easily be quartered for a a full bowl of salad.

I didn't love the recipe (I first made it as listed), but I did love the dressing (I added 1 tbs sesame oil as another reviewer recommended).  So the second time, I cooked up some rice noodles and tossed with julienned veggies (carrots, red peppers, radishes, pea pods) as well as a handful of cilantro and green onions.  Husband rated it his favorite dish.  So this is a great starting point for many great meals.

Absolutely delicious!! This was the first time I made or ate bok Choy, and we'll be growing it in the garden from now on. I had three baby bunches on hand, so halved the dressing recipe, then halved the sugar again. You will not need much sugar for this. Stick to half of whatever serving size the recipe calls for. I also used white wine vinegar due to recommendations if other reviewers, and glad I did. You wouldn't get the complexity of flavor without it. I had made a no-bake berry crisp as well and used the chopped nuts/brown sugar mixture for on top of this salad. Divine! Would definitely recommend this or candied nuts. Will make many more times.

Very good salad.  I used rice wine vinegar, and it was delicious.  I also tossed in sliced, crisp apples.  The whole family enjoyed it.

The first time I made this salad I stuck to the recipe and made no modifications. I loved the flavor, but thought the dressing overpowered the bok choy and made it a bit slimy.  The second time I made these modifications: substituted sliced almonds for slivered, added sesame seeds for more calcium, and reduced the dressing by half. PERFECT!!!

I'm not sure why all the other reviews are so positive.  This was just okay for me... maybe would have been better using only the stems of the bok choy and not the leaves, which have such an odd flavor when consumed raw.  Also, the dressing makes WAY too much - you need less than half of that.  And it's incredibly unhealthy!

I went out on a limb and bought a box of baby bok choy at Costco - there must have been 20 of those little guys in there - and then thought "What am I going to do with all this?" - making the bok choy the base of a salad is a great idea and such a nice change from the usual lettuce and spinach. I chopped everything up, added a little grated carrot and chopped red pepper, just because I had some on hand and left it undressed in an airtight container in the fridge.  I had it for lunch with a little turkey or chicken on top for protein. Also used it as a side at dinner time that week. It keeps well and was a flavorful change of pace.

My husband didn't think he would like this....he LOVED it and so did I! I didn't have ramen or chow mein noodles, just added extra toasted almonds and sesame seeds with some ground up crispy seaweed. The 1/2 tsp of ground coriander that Candy suggested was the finishing spice that made it all good. Added fresh sliced mushrooms too. Anything would be good with that dressing!

We loved this. Like others, we made a few modifications, but the base recipe is delicious. We couldn't get much bok choy, and only regular bok choy, not baby, so we subbed the second bunch with baby spinach. Also used rice vinegar, 1 T. toasted sesame oil, mandarin oranges, and, 1/2 tsp ground coriander, for a more authentic taste. As stated, this makes a lot more dressing than you would ever use on 2 bunches of bok choy (we used a little less than half), but you *will* use the rest. Salad would be great with the addition of fried or grilled chicken strips, and dressing would make a great marinade for chicken or beef. The almonds and chow mein noodles are the necessary finish for this salad...don't skip them! Thanks very much for this recipe!

Amazeballs.

This whole combination is stunningly good.  I love bok choy, and this is my favorite bok choy salad so far.  But even without the rest of the salad, the dressing is amazing.  It made a lot more than I needed for the salad, and I used it on so many other things throughout the week.

I will not make this again.  It was a very expensive salad, and frankly, it tastes as though it should have been cooked.  Very "raw" flavor that neither I nor my guests found pleasing.

Great salad! I only gave it 4 stars because as written, I think the dressing to salad ratio isn't quite right. Here are my modifications:  1. DOUBLE the salad ingredients. 2. HALVE the dressing ingredients.  3. Only use 2 T of sugar. 4. Add some extra color/sweetness with mandarin orange slices. If you're nervous about halving the dressing, just make the full amount with 1/4 C sugar, dress the salad with half, and put the rest of the dressing on the table so people can add more if they want. This is what I did and nobody went for the extra dressing. Our company loved this salad, and I'm excited to have found another tasty way to enjoy greens!

A great start to fresh bok choy! The dressing is really good. In my opinion, it is missing something. I think dried cranberries, cherries, or craisins would be a nice addition. Something a little tart to mix with these flavors. I would make it again but I would add these.

I cannot say it enough... I LOVE THIS SALAD!  It's just a perfect combination of crunch, sweet, salty, nutty, and juicy.  I made the salad and then realized it would need to be eaten ASAP.  I ate it all in several servings over a 24 hr period... AND WANTED MORE!  I didn't see baby bok choy at the store, and wonder if it's more expensive...  seriously!

I made as is and it was wonderful served with salmon. I have modified and sweeten with just a little bit of honey instead of sugar, use rice vinegar and I add dried cranberries or blueberries or raisins. I don't think you need the chow mein noodles... the almonds add crunch and flavor.

Very versatile. The dressing is great except for being to sweet. I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup, and I maybe could have cut it a tad more. I added some radicchio for color as well as some Mandarin oranges and some sugar snap peas, but the original base would be fine as is.

After sitting down and trying it as stated we added golden raisins and feta since it needed dimension.  We also added the tsp of sesame oil.  This is a great base to work from but it definitely needs more stuff added.

Super easy, delicious salad. I added dried cranberries, since I thought they were in the recipe picture and it looked good.  Great addition the whole family loves

This is a great recipe.  There was no baby bok choy at my market so I settled for Romaine lettuce.  I cut it into thin strips and did not dress the salad until a few minutes before serving as the lettuce would have gotten too soggy sitting in the dressing for a long time.  My guests snorted the salad down like there was no tomorrow.

I would cut the sugar by half.  Everyone in my family agreed that the salad was too sweet.  I think there may have been too much dressing for the amount of bok choy I used though - mine didn't come in bunches, so I had to guess as to what "two bunches" might look like.  Either way, though, I would cut the sugar.

This recipe is not only delicious but super simple!  I've never cooked with bok choy, only had it at Asian restaurants, but my grandmother gave me some fresh from her garden so I decided to try it out.  I cut the recipe in half because I only had 1 bunch of bok choy and it worked very well.  I also had some leftover beef filets that I sliced and placed on top.  Would highly recommend!

Delicious!  I used organic garden grown baby bok choy, and substituted Braggs amino acids for soy sauce and agave nectar for sugar.  Thanks for the other suggestions to use rice vinegar and sesame oil- this is a yummy dressing.  Couldn't bring myself to eat chow mein noodles so doubled the almonds also!!

I didn't have baby bok choy, so I used an 'adult' bok choy. I also added canned mandarins and omitted the noodles (didn't have them). It was great!!! I liked the bok choy just by itself even! I think I might start using it instead of lettuce. Thanks for the recipe!

This is really tasty.  I added canned drained mandarin oranges, and the overall effect was very similar to Wendy's Asian chicken salad, minus the chicken.  (This is a compliment as I think it's a tasty salad, plus you can make enough for at least four people for the cost of one of their salads.)  The only caution would be to use the dressing sparingly if you're watching your calories, it has a good bit of sugar in it.

Truly fresh and delicious.  I used white wine vinegar in place or regular white vinegar...richer flavour...did not use the noodles, not a fan or them, but DID add mandarin oranges.  Loved the flavour added by the  seasoned almonds I had in the house...Again, it was fresh, tasty, and definitely will make again fr my husband and for guests.   Enjoy!!

I have made this as is and it is super good.  I have also used the same dressing recipe and added everything but the kitchen sink!  Today I used whole wheat penny pasta, sauteed chicken, and sauteed leeks, carrots, celery, green pepper, and baby bok choy.  tossed together and served at room temp for lunch.  cold for dinner.  topped with the slivered almonds.  delicious.  Love this so much.  There is so much that can be done with this base!

I had some baby bok choy and green onions to use up, so I was happy to find this recipe, which looked like it would be tasty with a few changes. For starters, just looking at the ingredients, I could tell that this made WAY too much dressing. I cut all the dressing ingredients in half, and it was still pretty juicy, not inedible, but not perfect, either. I was also confused about the amount of green onions...I ended up using four decent sized onions and it was plenty. I also had three baby bok choys that were all very small, so I just put them all in. I was pleasantly surprised by the flavor of this salad...very tasty! It is a bit sweet, though...if I make it again, I'll cut back on the sugar a bit. Thanks for sharing the recipe...it's a really yummy, different, and healthy way to eat bok choy!

the dressing is good - just like Chinese chicken salad dressing!  I think I prefer my Bok Choy cooked - I felt that the bitterness was overwhelming (especially when all the "green leafies" are solely bok choy).  Might try half bok choy and half napa, cabbage or spinach or something.

This was a hit with my whole family!  I added mandarin orange sections for color but otherwise followed the receipe.  I did use rice vinegar in place of the regular white vinegar for a more subtle taste.  There was more dressing than we needed but it should keep well enough in the fridge.

Delicious!  We added dried cranberries because it looked like they were in the picture, but they weren't in the recipe.  This was SOOO good! We made it with a big family dinner and it got eaten up, but I also made it with just 2 of us.  When I did that, I just kept the dressing separate and put the dressing on each individual portion just like having regular salad.  Super yummy!

This is very similar to 3 other recipes, so I combined all 3. I added carrots for crunch, used regular Bok Choy since I didn’t have baby, and also followed another suggestion and added the noodles to each portion because I anticipated leftovers. I added the flavor packet to the soy mix for flavor and poured over the cabbage early to soften it up a bit. Overall it was very good but needed something to give it some oomph, to make it memorable. Perhaps some red pepper flakes or some lemon or lime zest? Would make again.

Yummy!  I was pleasantly surprised at how much my family liked this.  We had two bunches of bok choy from our CSA share and didn't know what to do with it. We didn't have baby bok choy, but it was just as good with the regular stuff.

A great way to use up baby bok choy from our CSA. This salad was very tasty and light. Based on another review I added dried cranberries and sunflower seeds.  Next time I would half the dressing part and add a sliced pear.

Four stars because the dressing was great.  The salad itself, I think something went wrong on my end.  I used organic bok choy; cleaned and chopped it.  The bok choy had the most horrible aftertaste, like swampy water.  I've eaten bok choy many times and this just was foul.  I think you could use lettuce too and this would be a great salad.

This is so easy & delicious.  Baby bok choy was difficult to find - but was worth the search.  I used pre-sliced almonds & didn't toast them.

I made this for a themed potluck and it was loved by everyone!  So glad I have been introduced to Baby Bok Choy.  The sauce was very generous, I might double the Bok choy next time...I wish there had been leftovers.

I about halfed the dressing recipe, eyeballing it. I cut down the sugar too. It was enough dressing after everything was tossed, just enough flavor without everything being drenched. I also just chopped some raw almonds and crushed ramen noodles in it instead of the chow mein noodles. Yum!

This was very good. My market didn't have baby bok choy, so I used regular, and it was fine--not bitter at all. I subbed agave for sugar, and I used half white vinegar and half rice vinegar. I used half of the dressing, and that was plenty (and the remainder was a great dipping sauce for Roasted Brussels Sprouts, also from this site). I omitted the chow mein noodles, but next time I may add toasted sesame seeds or homemade flax crackers for crunch.

Nice change for the usual salad.  I had newman's own thia dressing in the fridge  - went very well. I also toasted the noodles and almonds together in the oven.  Just needed some shredded carrots for some extra color.

Very good dressing.  This recipe was just what I needed to help use the abundance of Chinese cabbage and spinach from my garden.  I added red radish slivers for color and used chives as I didn't have scallions.  Next time I will try rice vinegar rather than white vinegar.  I used 2 quarts of greens and still have more than 1/2 of the dressing left.

Took the advice of another and since baby bok choy was not available, I used chopped spinach chopped romaine.  So good, I can't wait to make it with original ingredients!  Really great dressing.

Thank God I found this recipe!  I had so much baby bok choy, I didn't know how to use it all!  This was so good.  I used balsamic vinegar and added 1 tbsp of sesame oil.  I omitted the noodles since I didn't have any on me, and I substituted toasted sesame seeds for the almonds since I'm allergic.  Yum!

I made this today (11/5/19).  I had gotten two bunches of bok choy in an Imperfect Produce box recently.  Had heard of bok choy but had never eaten it so did an ingredient search on allrecipes.com and came across this.  I made the dressing as written even though I thought the amount of sugar seemed excessive.  I tore up one of the bunches of bok choy and added some almonds and chow mein noodles (didn't measure either) and poured some dressing (maybe a Tbsp.) on the salad.  I didn't add onion.  The dressing was OK.  The bok choy was kind of rubbery and didn't seem to have much flavor.  I have plenty of dressing left and will use on the remaining bunch of bok choy and salads using other greens.  I don't know that I will make this particular dressing again once this this is gone.

I loved this recipe .  Bok choy is so crunchy.
I eliminated OIL - as I do plant based with no added oil.
It was amazing.
I just used chow mein noodles but did not add the flavouring package ( way too much salt ).

I would double the dressing next time - still NO OIL.


Hands down - a recipe everyone will love.

This was delicious. I made a few minor changes. Used regular bok choy from my garden, no baby. I also added a small sliced kirby cuke, and chopped regular onion, instead of green onion. I also used rice vinegar instead of white and only 1/8 cup of sugar.

Great flavor! I added water chestnuts and slivered carrots for more substance. I've never had raw bok choy but it's not my new favorite. I dd use rice vinegar vs white and splenda vs sugar.

Everybody loved it, especially my husband.  Didn't have almonds and will cut down on the sugar a wee bit next time.  The ramen noodles were a hit as well adding even more crunch.

I received regular bok choy from my CSA and since I never had bok choy before I found this recipe.  At first, I thought it was a hot dish and when I was ready to make it, I had my doubts as to how good it was going to be, but I trusted the reader reviews and was so glad I did.  My boyfriend and I just loved it.  I made the recipe exactly except I couldn't find the chow mein noodles in the store so I used lo mein noodles.  Also, I used white wine vinegar instead of white vinegar.  It would have been fine without the noodles.  Next time I will try reader suggestions: sesame oil, craisins and chicken!

This was surprisingly very very tasty! The ONE thing I changed, was the soy sauce. I used to use Liquid Aminos, until I found out it contains soy. So, a great substitution for soy is Coconut Aminos. Other than that, I changed nothing.  *When first trying out a recipe, I change nothing, unless one ingredient presents an allergen to myself or my family. After the first try, I may or may not tweak a recipe. This one will stay the same!

Definitely a keeper.  Makes a great salad to bring to supper. I did not include the noodles. Used Baby Bok, sliced the green part and made matchsticks since slivers of the site part, together with court and red pepper (also cut into matchsticks). I toasted sunflower seeds as one of the guests can not have tree-nuts. I also added canned mandarine segments and omitted the onion (again, dietary restrictions for raw onion).

I'm so glad I found this recipe. It's inexpensive, easy to make, crunchy and absolutely delicious. Fabulous with fish. I agree with Christine M., I did think a touch of sesame oil would have been a nice addition and rice vinegar would have been lovely, too, but a bit more expensive and not as tangy, so for me and my family, I'll stick with white vinegar. Thanks for this!

It lives up to it's name...YUMMY! The textures and flavors are amazing together.  I did substitute rice vinegar for white.  The dressing is soooo good I started using it on regular salads and coleslaw.  I do wish it was a little thicker though.

This salad is delicious.  I added jicama because I had it and craisins which added a lot of extra flavor.  Will definitely make this again and think the dressing could go well on a variety of lettuces not just bok choy.

We never get fresh baby Bok Choy but landed some and tried this recipe.  OMG!  Best fresh salad I have ever had. The dressing was great with sugar substitute and perfect. I am making it again today. It is so green and pretty and just looks fresh.

This was really good.  I used regular bok choy.  The only I change I would make would be to make less dressing there was a lot left over in the bowl.

Added yellow bell peppers and carrots for bright splashes of color. Omitted the almonds and noodles. Swapped out the white vinegar for  rice wine vinegar and added white pepper for a bit of heat. Had some basil and tarragon so decided to add these too - what a refreshing salad for a hot & humid summer night!!!

Quick as can be and delish too. I used chow mein noodles but that was my only alteration. The combination of the dressing  and the salad will be why it be added to my repitrore of recipes.

Baby Bok Choy is sweet and refreshing, it makes for a marvelous salad. I had stuff to use up so added edamame, red & yellow bell peppers. Those additions were lovely. Loved the crunchy almonds and noodles. As other reviewers noted this recipe makes too much dressing which is far too sweet for me. I used rice wine vinegar, mush less sugar, and added a splash of toasted sesame oil. Ended up with a dressing I like a lot. This salad is a hit.

Delicious! So easy. The baby bok choy doesn't need time to marinate or wilt. I made it with scallions, blueperries, and pecans (what I had in my fridge), and white wine vinegar. My guests cleaned their plates. THANK YOU!

I didn't have anything but the dressing ingredients and the bok choy. It was delicious just with that. As another reviewer recommended, I added some ground ginger. It was fantastic!

Delicious!! I followed Chester Copperpot's advice and used 1 T olive oil, 1 T sesame oil, 2 T rice vinegar, 1 T sugar and 1 T soy sauce for the dressing. Plenty! I couldn't find baby bok choy, so used a full bunch. Tasted great! I added dried cranberries. Following others' advice, I also had a ramekin of chow mein noodles on the table for people to add their own. That way no soggy noodles in my husband's leftover lunch tomorrow! Thanks for sharing! This will be a frequent part of our dinners!

We get baby bok choy sometimes in our veggie co-op and I never know what to do with it!  I hate it cooked, as does my family.  My kids are pretty picky in the veggie department.  We made this tonight for dinner.  Cut the dressing in half and added grilled chicken breast, dried cranberries, and mandarin oranges.  It was DELICIOUS!  All 3 of the youngsters, youngest being 4, ate it all up!  We will DEFINITELY make this again!  And again!

Like some of the other people who commented here, I had just bought bok Choy for the first time and googled for recipes. This is a truly amazing salad. I also used toasted sesame oil mixed with olive oil and pecans instead of almonds and I did not have the crunchy noodles, but it was just amazing. This will become a new standard recipe in our house. So simple and so good. Thank you.

DELICIOUS! I'd never had baby bok choy before this salad and was a bit nervous to try it, honestly. Highly recommend! You can easily halve the dressing recipe. I suggest using about 3 bunches of baby bok, and use more leaf than stalk, though some stalk is good. Yum!!

Flat out delicious! My husband and I LOVED this salad. The other reviewer is right, this dressing perfectly balances the distinctive flavor of baby bok choy. Highly recommended! (I modified the recipe slightly to use what I had on hand: rice vinegar, three bunches of baby bok choy, and Ramen noodles. I also threw in a tablespoon of sesame oil.)

All my friends and family love this salad!  I do normally mix in a little romaine or red leaf lettuce with the bok choy, and most of the time I leave the almonds out.  It doesn't really seem to matter what you do as long as you get the dressing right!

We especially love the dressing for this salad even if I changed the ingredients just a bit to use what I had on hand.  I substituted rice wine vinegar and used Splenda instead of sugar for the dressing.  For the salad I substituted a blend of nappa cabbage and romaine lettuce. I used rice noodles instead of chow mein because I like the smaller texture and greater crunch.  I also added orange slices, Craisins, pineapple tidbits, fresh sweet red pepper chopped, and offered diced chicken/and or shrimp as protein toppings.  We had this for supper on Christmas as a healthy finish to our day.

I used rice vinegar, as suggested, and also used up some Romane lettuce that was needing to be eaten.  I added some diced grilled chicken.  I will make this again.

This was great! I didn't have green onions or almonds so I just made this with the baby bok alone. I gotta say, it really brought out the flavor. It's a perfect side dish or light lunch for a hot day!

Loved it. The recipe definitely made a LOT of dressing but we will be able to use it on any salad over the next week.

Excellent way to use up all that garden bokchoy.  I used the craisins as shown in the pic.  I mixed the dressing up in a jelly jar and chopped the rest and threw that into a bag and took it camping.  Gave the almonds and ramen noodles a quick toasting in some melted butter and tossed it all together.  As someone said, you could double the bokchoy as the dressing is more than enough for a bigger salad.  It was really delicious and held up very well on the camping trip.  I will definitely make this over and over again.  Thank you!

VERY yummy alternative to a traditional iceberg lettuce salad.  My family even ate the salad leftovers! It has a nice crunch, and the bok choy, if fresh, didn't wilt for a couple of days.

We also receive a good deal of bok choy or similar greens (tat soi this week) and have found limited favor from the kiddos in stir frying them with our other veggies. So this recipe was a great way to ENJOY every last bite of the strong-flavored green!  We were serving to father who is diabetic, so used Splenda in place of sugar, and I would use less sweetener or sugar in the future, as we added naturally sweet cranberries and drained can of mandarin oranges.  Skipped the almonds this time, due to son's nut allergy, but we would have liked having those in the salad, too!  We had so much dressing left at the bottom of salad bowl, that we poured it into a jar to save for the next time we make it! Oh, and I just dressed a tiny sample of the greens for my youngest, who was hungry sooner than dinner was ready, and the bok choy/tat soi didn't wilt enough to make her dish of salad as palatable as the salad tossed with the dressing, I think.

I received about 10 bunches of baby Bok Choy in my co-op basket yesterday. I had never tried Bok Choy, so I needed a great recipe for it to help use up my abundance.  Delicious!! I will definitely be making this receipe again this week to use up the rest. The only change I made was to double the amount of bok choy, when I first made the salad there was a bunch of dressing in the bottom of the bowl.  Perfect, and I also suggest putting the chow mein noodles in the individual servings.

With the suggestions from other users - upped the bok choy, and added crasins and manderine oranges!  The "anti-anything green" husband had several helpings!

I tried something similar to this a few years ago but like this version much better.  We ordered Chinese take-out the other night and I made this salad to go with dinner and my friends loved it.  I used Splenda instead of sugar,  added dried cranberries and mandarin orange segments and topped it with crushed noodles from Ramen soup (instead of the chow mein noodles) and served it in individual salad bowls. Very pretty presentation. Also, I let everyone add their dressing as desired.  We were able to eat the left-over salad the next day and it would have been a soggy mess if I had dressed the whole salad.

This dressing is delicious.  I did not have bok choy so I substituted a bag of broccoli slaw and a bag of fresh baby spinach.  I toasted the almonds and also topped the salad with crunchy wonton strips.  This goes great with any Asian meat or fish recipe.  Thanks!!

Awesome salad to pair with pork loin! My husband went crazy over it. I added sliced red cabbage, sesame seeds, and crasins to add some extra crunch and color. I can't wait to make this salad for summer picnics! So easy, and so yummy!

Very good salad.  I used Romaine lettuce, white wine vinegar, and peanuts because that is what I had on hand.  Will make this again, for sure.

The dressing is fantastic. I've also been looking for great new ways to eat my veggies. This is a great solution (just wish I could find a way to cut down on the sugar). Highly recommend for families with kids or grown ups who dislike vegetables.

This was pretty good. I stir fried broccoli and carrots too and put everything over brown rice. Next time I'll probably try brown sugar and maybe another type of vinegar.

This was really good and easy.  I threw in a couple of grape tomatoes because my kids love them and I didn't have the Chow Mein noodles so I broke up some dried Ramen Noodles and the kids loved the crunch.  There was definitely too much dressing though, so next time I will halve the dressing part.

A delicious, fresh recipe that can be thrown together in minutes! I have made the recipe twice now - the first time toasting the almonds in the oven, and the second time toasting them in a frying pan. The latter is slightly faster - but both work. I never knew bok choy could taste this good uncooked!

This recipe is delicious!  I had doubts about the bitterness of Bok Choy but its true, this is delicious.  Make sure the almonds are toasted well because it adds a delicious nutty flavor.  I think making this with a spinach salad recipe with bacon and eggs and red onion would be delicious also.

Totally delicious, I was impressed with how easily the dressing softened the bitterness of the bok choy. And so easy to make! I made some simple store-bought tortellini while I made this salad and it was under 10 mins start to finish!

I agree with others, this makes a ton of dressing, so don't add it before you serve it, you can't save leftovers then.  I used balsamic vinegar and ramen noodles.

Another winner! I have used Bok Choy various ways from oriental soup to Kimchee that I can in mason jars. This recipe I used ramen noodles in the basic salad and topped it off with chow mein noodles to avoid soggy salad. Love it.

A great salad. I didn't use the dark green ends of the greens -- they tend to be a bit bitter. And because I didn't have any chow mein noodles, I crumbled up some dry ramien noodles, and they worked just fine.

Yummy indeed! I didn't have bok choy so I made it with cabbage. I just got enough to taste, my husband ate it up. Also, didn't have chow mein noodles , so I skipped it. I am sure, if made as told (without my substitutions), it would taste even better. Thanks a lot!!

This recipe is a keeper! I have made this salad several times and its one of my husband's favorites! (And he doesn't like eating anything green)
I also add sesame crisps or fried wontons to the salad (instead of the noodles). This adds a nice crunchy texture. You can buy these fried wontons in the grocery store, near the salad condiments.

This is a good recipe - a nice alternative to the standard steamed bok choy.

This recipe is a regular in my house. It is very healthy and sooo delicious.  I use regular bok choy and a pkg of ramen noodles sprinkled on top.  This was a big hit with my whole family.  Even my 3 and 4 year olds love it!!

Absolutely loved it.  I didn't have the almonds on hand, so I made without.  So delicious!

This salad is so good it inspired me to join allrecipes.com so I could add a review!  It's simple to make, sweet, healthy, and addicting.  I left out the chow mein noodles and never missed them.

This was ok, a little too oily for my taste.

I added sliced cherry tomatoes and substituted chopped walnuts for the sliced almonds.  Excellent!  Have already made it again.

My family liked the dressing and salad. We didn't realy care for the chow mein noodles though.  I think next timeI will use craisins as another reviewer mentioned.

The dressing for this salad is unbelievable. I substituted spinach for the bok choy and it worked really well. I will definitely be making this on a regular basis.

Quick and very easy.  It's a great change from the usual lettuce and/or spinach I make.  I took a chance and used cider vinegar since I didn't have any white, and luckily the dressing tasted great still.  Well definitely use white vinegar next time. Thanks for sharing.

This salad is delicious - we've never had raw bok choy.  Excellent flavor.

Great salad. I use Romane Lettuce (2 bunches) and celery or spinach instead. It is easier for my small kids to eat. Great dressing. this is awesome with any Asian foods
