I loved this bread. This was my first experience with Truvia and I'm very pleased.  I followed the recipe exactly but poured it into a (one) bigger loaf pan  and it turned out great. Cake like texture, awesome. I'm now in search of more truvia recipes. Next time I might add some clove or nutmeg ????

This was really good. I think you should definitely have either a stand mixer or electric  hand mixer. I followed the directions exactly and it came out wonderful. certainly will make again.
