Excellent!!  My husband and I loved this dressing.  The only change I made was to use 1 tsp. of salt instead of 2 which seemed too much.  It was great.  Will use this again and again.

Very good.  I used olive oil, and only 1/2 tsp. salt, as we don't use much salt.  Worked well on both a tomato and onion salad, and a salad with mixed greens, tomato and cuke.  Teenage son liked it too!...I'm updating my review to say that I've also made this with sherry vinegar with good results. Also, I have had to cut down on salt so now I leave it out altogether. The vinegar has enough of a kick so it's still good, even without the salt.

2 teaspoons of salt was just way overboard for me--I had to add extra vinegar and oil to set it off.  I also added pepper and extra garlic.  1/2 tsp salt would be plenty for the amounts of oil and vinegar.  Very tasty after the changes I made.  Extra light olive oil suits my taste much better than the vegetable oil.

Simple and delicious - a really easy and great tasting vinaigrette dressing! I used olive oil vs. vegetable oil and cut the salt down to 1/4 tsp. I also added some cracked black pepper.  This was great over mixed greens topped with cucumbers, cherry tomatoes, and thin sliced red onion.

One word, WOW!  There is such a huge difference in this dressing and the store-bought kind.  I will also never buy bottled again!  This took literally 5 minutes to put together.  I used olive oil and added freshly ground black pepper.  My new favorite salad is this dressing, romaine mixed with iceburg, dried cranberries, feta cheese, cucumbers, red onion, yellow pepper and pecans or walnuts.  I also added a little fresh basil to the salad before mixing.  This does separate, so a salad dressing shaker with a tight fitting lid is a must.

This was really easy to make - however, it needed a bit more zip, so I added some cracked pepper, which helped. Great on salads, it's super-light.

I thought there would be way too much vinegar when I made this, but it turned out quite well.  I used olive oil and only 1/2 tsp of salt.  It was wonderful on my simple spinach and tomato salad.  Thanks!

This is a good basic recipe.  I cut the recipe in half.  I used half safflower oil and half olive oil.  I thought I could get away with half the sugar, but no, it needed nearly the entire amount.

This vinagrette has become my absolute favorite. I particularly like it on romaine lettuce with tomatoes, red/yellow pepper, red onion, feta cheese and toasted almonds.  Everytime i've made this salad for anyone i've had rave reviews.

So easy and so incredibly delicious! I could have drank this stuff! I used my hand blender to mix it and it worked very well. It eventually seperated but not as quickly. I added just a touch more sugar than it called for. I am NEVER buying vinigarette again! Thanks!

Very tasty and right up my alley since I absolutely love garlic. Since I'm watching fat and calories, I used two packs of Equal instead of sugar, and Enova salad/cooking oil. Turned out great, thanks!

This is so easy and a wonderful base recipe. I love to add more garlic, sometimes lemon juice, switch up the vinegar, use Honey instead of sugar. The possibilities are endless and you can make this dressing to match any meal your serving. 
Awesome!
Thanks!

Followed the recipe but used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar because I didn't have enough. Added a smidge more sugar because balsamic is strong and added fresh basil from my garden.  So Yummy!

This dressing is terrific! Even my children enjoy it, which is saying something. We now have to keep a batch of this made up at all times since it is so popular here. The only thing I suggest doing is reducing the salt to 1 tsp (you can always add that second if you find it needs it). I made the recipe "as is" the first time and found it toooo salty (and I am a diehard salt fan). I also substituted honey for the sugar. Thanks for this very versatile recipe, Karen!

The flavor is excellent. The only problem is that the oil and vinegar will separate almost instantly, so you have to shake it a lot before each pouring.

USE LESS SALT!!!! I wanted to write that so it could be seen first. The recipe is good, but definitely use less salt! Others have written the salt thing, too, but I didn't read the comments first. Don't do what I did! I also used olive oil rather than vegetable oil.

It's a great basic recipe that you can then customize with your own personal tastes.  I omitted the sugar & used about 1T. honey & mustard, as well as adding 1 small onion & a few fresh basil leaves & put it all in the food processor!  It was SO SO good.  I'll be using this for all of my basic vinaigrette recipes & taylor as the mood strikes.

Call me lame but I wanted just a plain dressing so I omitted the garlic and salt and just used white vinegar I had on hand.  It was a nice subtle and sweet dressing I can make in a jiffy!

Excellent basic vinaigrette.  This is exactly what I was looking for and I was very happy with the results.

This was the first salad dressing that I've ever made myself.  I didn't have very high expectations because I didn't see how, with such a short ingredient list, it could be very flavorful, but it was GREAT.  I took it with a big green salad to a BBQ and it absolutely disappeared and I had lots of people asking for the recipe.  This is now a staple in my house.

Also, the first time I made it I didn't have any red wine vinegar so I used Chinese red vinegar - it's fabulous both ways.  Thanks so much for sharing!

Delicious!  Learned the hard way that it separates and the will will harden within a couple days if you don't have it in a container with a tight-fitting lid!

Terrific!  First time making my own salad dressing and this was a hit.  Did not include the salt and it was fine.  Great on spinach salad w/red onion, mandarin oranges and tomato.

Simple and perfect!  I substituted olive oil for the vegetable oil and honey for the white sugar.  Mixed in the blender and it was creamy and delicious.  I don't think I will buy bottled salad dressing again!

I do love this dressing.  I read other's reviews and crushed the garlic with the flat side of my chef's knife and then threw the entire clove into the dressing.  All the taste without the actual garlic!  Also, I like my dressing heavy on the vinegar, so added more.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Easy & tasty.  I used olive oil & splenda instead of vegetable oil & sugar.  I am anxious to try it w/ other kinds of vinegar.

This was just OK. A bit too strong for our taste. It felt like it needed something else. Might make again but would experiment with the quantities.

WOW! This dressing is SO delicious. I put it over a garden salad with tortellini and it really made it jazzy! I will make this again and again and again. Better than the restaraunts and better than the bottled stuff and so so so so easy. I doubled the recipe but other than that I made it exactly the way it says. Thanks for sharing it!

I prepared this dressing exactly as it is written. It was WAY too salty. And I am someone who usually likes things a little on the salty side. I would definitely cut the amount of salt in half if I made it again.

I did not care for this recipe. I wish I could find a nice vinaigrette or homemade salad dressing, but they always seem to have such a strong vinegar taste. I hate vinegar...but love vinaigrettes when I go out to dinner. Maybe I'm just not letting it sit in the fridge long enough for flavors to set.

The flavor was good, but the densities of the olive oil and red wine vinegar were too different, so they never combined. I kept getting a bite of olive oil, then a bite of vinegar. But, it was tasty.

For a simple recipe this one came out great! I guess I would add less salt but was really tasty following it as is! I added 1 tsp of dried Italian seasoning to jazz it up! Thanks for this I'll make it again.

Simple and easy to make.  Don't forget the sugar or it will be to tart.  I added a small handful of fresh blueberries for a blueberry vinaigrette  It came out great.

If you are using lower quality vinegar, you will need to add a little more sweetener. I used honey - about 1/2 tsp or so. I used 1 tsp Kosher salt and added 1 tsp mayo to help emulsify the oil and vinegar.

Excellent Vinaigrette!  The garlic really brings out the flavor.  I cut the salt to 1 teaspoon - thought the sodium was too high.  Great easy recipe!

I had some technical difficulties when my "shaker" unexpectedly opened mid-shake & coated my kitchen with the dressing, BUT what remained for me to try was yummy!  I love the vinegary-ness of this dressing.  I used EVOO, and I did half the recipe because I just didn't need that much at one time.  Will definitely make again!

YUM! The only thing I changed was 1 tsp of salt instead of 2.  I also added some parsley & romano. The recipe is great by itself & also a great base to add different twists to it.

We and our friends all thought this was way too salty.  We mixed it with another vinaigrette and could eat it then but found it to be inedible on its own.

We've been making this for a couple of years now and never tire of it; it's so good!  We call it our "House Vinaigrette".   But definitely halve the salt!   We also bump up the garlic.

I had this over arugula that I topped with pan-seared scallops. I used olive oil in place of vegetable oil, had to add more sugar and added a little pepper. Worked here and will be good over a regular salad.

I really like this. Easy, delicious, add a touch of dijon to smooth out flavor. Only need couple of tsps. For large salad. Keeper.

great recipe, super easy. But...If you find it just a bit too tart from the vinegar, as I did, just add a touch of Dijon mustard to the mixture and you'll see how it rounds it right out. After that, it was absolutely fab! It will be my go-to recipe.

Wow factor! I was in a bind for a vinaigrette and didn't have any balsamic vinegar. This recipe fit my needs. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I halved the salt. I used 1 teaspoon of white sugar and 1.5 teaspoons of honey. Fantastic!

My "go to" quick dressing. I've used white wine vinegar instead of red and comes out great. I've diced onions into it as well. Family loves it for cucumber salad.

I used Olive oil, and Apple cider vinegar and splenda as my sugar. This was a bit oily for my taste. I made some changes. First thing any oil at a 1/2 of a cup is 900 whopping calories. Yikes! So to cut down on the oil. I also added lemon juice and some dijon mustard and just mixed it up to taste. It was delicious to say the least. I say great recipe just tweek to your likings!

Love it! I too used less salt but to be fair, I always use less salt the recipe calls for in ANY recipe. I made it without the sugar (I don't like sweet) and it was good as is but then I decided to add a little honey and I admit, it made it better. The vegetable oil is a good idea for a lighter taste. I like it a little heavier. I only had extra virgin olive oil on hand which is too heavy so I did half half veg oil and EVOO. In the end I added a squirt of stone ground mustard,  fresh pepper and some dried onion. It was very good either way.

We love this dressing.  Flavorful and sweet. I used extra garlic and subbed powdered stevia for the sugar.

This is a really great dressing recipe.  Especially most people have all the ingredients on hand. I used 1 1/2 cloves of garlic and the garlic wasn't over powering.  I think it would be a perfect compliment to fresh tomato, mozzarella & basil salad!

Very tangy and very yummy.  I reduced the salt by half and that was more than enough.

This is AWESOME! I did however make a couple changes to it that suited better to our tastes. I cut the salt in half and used only 1 tsp. I also went just a tad heavier on the crushed garlic. Absolutely delicious!
