This is a family tradition (yes, Lithuanian!) However we use chopped bacon, diced ham and add evaporated milk also.  We don't use the flour.   We just chop everything up in the food processor, transfer to a bowl, add eggs & evaporated milk, transfer to a baking dish (coated with Pam for easy clean-up!) and bake at 350 for about an hour.  The flavor is AMAZING!!!  We also serve with a dollop of sour cream.  (Just as a note - you can freeze leftover ham (from holidays) and leftover bacon and thaw them out when you're ready to make the Kugeli! :)

This is an excellent recipe. Okay I am Lithuanian but still....it's the best. I lost my own family recipe so thank goodness I found this one. In my family we call it, Kugelis. My children love when I make this, I serve it with sour cream.

I used bacon in this and cut the recipe back to fit in a 9x13 pan. We felt it needed a little salt, but this was really good. Comfort food like a cross between mashed potato and a hash brown casserole. I'm going to try crying the slices with breakfast tomorrow as per the suggestion.

My Mom and Grandma made this all the time. When I tried using the food processor the texture was all wrong. More like mashed potatoes than koogilie. my Mom used to grate the potatoes by hand on a box grater and got little granules of potato instead of smush. Grinding 5 pounds by hand is a chore and little bits of knuckle don't improve the flavor. I found by first using the carrot shredding blade in the processor,,the one that rides at the top of the processor bowl, and then carefully pulsing 1/2 bowl batches with the regular blade I can easily get the right textured bits of potato. Doesn't add much time and just one extra blade to wash , but what a difference in taste. We also omit the flour and use a can of evaporated milk for 5 lbs of potatoes. Mom said the milk prevented the mix from turning grey before cooking.
