Excellent marinade! My husband and I loved it! I didn't have tahini, so I subbed 2 Tbsp. of sesame oil which worked great. I also used 1/4 cup of Splenda instead of 1/2 cup because that would have proven to be waaay to sweet! I also used low sodium soy sauce. I cut the chicken into chunks for kabobs and let it marinate about 8 hours. Boy, was this ever good! It has a sweet, oriental flair to it and is "Absolutely Addictive". It's great paired with steamed broccoli, carrots, baby corn and rice.

Such a flexible recipe.  I sub an equal amount of sesame oil for the sesame seeds.  I use peanut butter instead of tahini.  I use a little less splenda than directed and also use sugar for a separate batch for the rest of the family.  Everybody is happy.

Amazing! I used real surgar instead of splenda but other than that I followed exactly. The best marinade I have ever tasted. Thanks for sharing.

I followed the recipe exactly, but something about the combination was a little off, for me.  I liked that the Splenda kept the grill from flaring up, and the chicken had a nice color, but overall the taste was very sweet, with the tahini hard to detect.  I wasn't happy with the little "crispy critters" that developed on the grill from the chopped cilantro leaves, and we lost the beauty of the sesame seeds as they slid off the meat.  I feel this would work better as a sauce than a marinade.

I substituted tahini with 2 tablespoons of peanut butter, combined ingredients in a food processor, and marinated boneless, skinless chicken breasts for 36 hours. Served with sauce over speghetti squash. AMAZING!!! New favorite dish!!!

I've used this recipe many times for chicken and it's always so good. The longer it marinates the more savory and delicious it is. It's a go to for sure.

I used this marinade in chicken stir-fry.  Wow!!  Didn't use the tahini and only used 1/4 cup Splenda.  My husband went from a not happy face when I told him what we were having for dinner to having seconds.  I will definately be using this marinade for chicken on the grill.  I think next time I will try the peanut butter as mentioned by some people.

My husband used sugar instead of splenda, and subbed almond butter for the tahini, and this turned out to be one of the most delicious marinades we've ever had.  Even though we put it on a fabulous filet mignon, we will also be using this on chicken and tofu in the future.
