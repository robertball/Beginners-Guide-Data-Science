From other reviewers I expected these to be much more thick/cakelike, so I decreased the amount of baking powder by almost half.  According to gourmetsleuth.com: "Baking soda must come in contact with an acid in order to form carbon dioxide gas which in turns makes the baked product rise."  Sour cream is one of those acids.  Anyway, these turned out fluffy and flavorful.  I didn't want to ruin them with icing so we enjoyed them plain!

There are at least 17 reviews on here and most of them reference that these are soft cake-like cookies.  The TITLE of the cookie is "Soft . . . "  So why ae people still complaining about soft cake-like cookjies in their reviews???  For goodness sake, people, what are the reviews for if not to warn you away from things you're probably not going to like?  (Of course there's other reasons to read the reviews too.)  Anyway, I thought these were really good - soft as I expected and wanted.  Not bursting with lots of flavor but I know that too from the reviews - and that's what I was looking for.  Good cookies that were perfect with the spicy peaches that went with them!

This is the best sugar cookie recipe ever.  My children and I made a batch of these wonderfully thick and soft cookies and they lasted less than a day.  It's fantastic by my family.:):)

I think they are great!  They are cake-like and very thick and soft.  Also good if you add a teaspoon of vanilla extract.

These are as others reviewed soft cake-like cookies. I found them to be very tasty. You have to expect them to be cake-like, for the recipe calls for 3 eggs. If you don't want your cookie like cake decrease to 2 eggs instead of 3.

the texture of these cookies turned out very cake-like, which i find unappealing in a cookie.  and they really only needed to be baked about 6 &1/2 minutes.

I love this recipe and the fact the cookies are cakelike.  I do agree they're a little bland, but that's why there are spices....makes it perfect to give your own touch!!  Thanks for the recipe :)

These were nice, light, cake like cookies, just as described! I did add a touch of vanilla extract. My husband described them as simple but good. I agree!

Absolutely terrible -- completely cake-like.  If you want a cake, then make a cake, not cookies.  I threw these all out and started over with a different recipe.

This was easy!  I wanted something sweet but didn't have many ingredients at home.  In fact I had to make sour cream (2/3 cup whole milk and teaspoon of lemon juice).  They turned out great.  They would really be good if I had frosting to put on them.

I am going to have to go with everyone else on this- these cookies taste like and have the same texture of CAKE, not cookies. These are miniature cakes.. Not exactly what I was hoping for when looking for a soft sugar cookie recipe (I was thinking I would get something similar to what they sell in grocery stores)-- I would recommend baking these for kids' birthday parties or something, because my kids did enjoy them, but I personally found I didn't want to eat very many of these 'CAKE-ies'.

Calling these cookies is wrong, they are very cake like. They are still very yummy. They should change the name of this recipe to flat cupcakes.

I think it's funny that everyone complains about cake-like cookies. French chef's would test their cake batter in small batches called "cookies". Anyway, my family likes them very much. Thank you.

Like many other reviews have said, this cookie tastes almost exactly like a muffin top.  It is perfect for a person on a diet, craving cakes and muffins (if you can limit yourself).  I added vanilla and a touch of cinnamon to mine - just to see what it would taste like.  Delicious.  Also, when I was almost done I added some leftover chocolate chips. A hint of chocolate and fattening cake rolled in to a small cookie.

I'm not an experienced cook or baker -I don't seem to have the patience for it- but this recipe looked fairly easy and yummy, since I hate hard, crunchy sugar cookies. I think maybe I should have just made the original kind of sugar cookie, because these came out horrible. I mean, totally disgusting. A waste of ingredients, my time, and my energy. I was thoroughly disappointed. I wanted to be able to sit down with warm, tastey cookies warming my frozen fingers, and got this garbage. Most reviewers issues with this recipe was that they came out too cake-like, but I like that. That is what I wanted. That is why I chose this recipe. But these were completely flavorless, and I had to lower the temperature to 400 degrees F and cook them for only 6 or 7 minutes so the friggin' bottoms didn't burn. *sighs in disgust* This whole experience was a pain. Luckily, I have only one cookie sheet, so each batch got a little better -though still unappetizing- because I added more and more sugar. LOL. I recommend adding vanilla extract too if you want it sweeter. Hell, toss in some nutmeg as well. *rolls eyes* Anything that will help. But, to be truthful, I wouldn't bake from this recipe ever again. *shakes head, disappointed* Not even my kick-butt cook of a mother could help me make these better. :-/

Wonderful cookies! Soft and not crumbly. Very good w/ spprinkles,frosting or sugar crystals. My husband couldn't stop eating them. I had to hide them so there would be some left for his work lunches this week. VERY easy to make.

My daughter wanted a soft sugar cookie for her daughter's class.  I found these and tried them.  We all taste tested them and loved them.  These cookies are now a regular treat.  We frost them with chocolate icing most of the time.  My grand daughter calls them "cup cake tops".   I'm baking them today for a church bake sale tomorrow.  The only thing I do differently is add 2 tsps of vanilla.

I followed the recipe exactly, except I added a dash of vanilla because, well, I add vanilla to almost everything. I glazed them with some confectioner's sugar mixed with some vanilla and water, and it made them even tastier. While the cookies tasted great, everyone who says it's more like a cupcake than a cookie is correct. My husband and I are going to be calling them Cupcake Tops now.

These are great cookies.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla to them because I've never seen a cookie recipe that didn't ask for vanilla or some other flavoring.  I figured the omission was a misprint.  These are soft cake like cookies.  Very yummy.  My husband says they remind him of the ones his grandmother made.

These are not sugar cookies. They came out very cakey. They did have a good flavor so after the first batch when I raelized they wouldn't be good as cookies, I baked the rest as a cake.  Turned out to be a good pound cake recipe.

This is the worst recipe ever. Sugar Cookies recipe, that is the furthest from the truth. The dough was so thin it was closer to a batter. I made the recipe again checking all the ingredients 2X's. The bake like pancakes. They are not firm like a cookie, they are not sweet like a SUGAR cookie. They are more like little pancakes. Usually I can salvage the finished product. 

So I brought them to work, where everyone eats anything. They just complained and I just ended up throwing them out. This is not a Sugar cookie recipe, do be fooled. Use it to make pancakes. Terrible... I will never make again

I followed the recipe exactly on these and the dough was too soft to hold up even for drop cookies.  It was also very bland.  I added 1/2 tsp almond extract, 1/2 tsp vanilla and another 2/3 cup of flour.  The dough was still very soft but good enough.  I had my husband taste the cookies (he'll eat anything) and even he thought they were quite bland.  They were also not "chewy" but very cake-like.  I made a thin glaze of powdered sugar, milk  & a few drops of almond extract and they were better but still not something I would make again.  Most of them ended up in the trash.

My husband and I went to an event - they served 2 different snacks and beverages - - no dessert (who DOES that?)!  As soon as we got home, I searched for a sugar cookie recipe that I didn't have to chill, and found this one.  It reminded me of my great-grandmother's recipe, sour cream and all, and wonderful, soft, cake-like texture.  I did add vanilla and cinnamon, and topped some of them with the last of my home-made granola.  Brewed the coffee, ate warm cookies, and totally enjoyed remembering Grandma Walton.  Thanks very much for posting this recipe.

Great recipe! I have been looking for a fluffy soft cookie recipe forever! It is great! I did read the reviews and thought my family would need more sweetness so I added a bit of vanilla and a little less sour cream.

I love love love this recipe! The sour cream makes the cookies so moist, and the recipe is so versatile that you can make any flavor under the sun! 
The pic I added was of the maple/pecan version. I did this by adding a teaspoon of maple flavor to the cookie dough as well as a cup of chopped pecans. The frosting is simply a stick of butter with a cup or so of powdered sugar and a teaspoon of  maple flavoring, melted together in a small sauce pan. As soon as you frost the cookie with the warm frosting you will want to add any decor, since the frosting sets up quickly. Enjoy!

We added 1 tsp of vanilla extract...much much better. But they taste dead on pancakes. Not the greatest cookies ever..but a fun time for me and the best friend.
