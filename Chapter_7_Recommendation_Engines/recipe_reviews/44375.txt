I made this recipe for a party and it was a huge hit.  I think this is the sort of recipe you either love or hat - no middle ground.

I made this for a dinner party. I am glad I tried it before I served it, because it was not very good at all. I will not make this again

Too wet to ball up: absolute failure. If I could give zero stars, I would. Completely unpresentable.

Delicious! Used and 8 oz. cream cheese, green onions instead of regular and rolled in dried cilantro instead of fresh.

I used this recipe as a starting point for making a krab mix for sushi.  I don't particularly enjoy cream cheese in my rolls so I substituted mayo and used the rest of the ingredients to my own taste.  I was skeptical about using the pickled jalepeno but found that they were very tasty, I also mixed in the cilantro.  I added this mixture to a sushi roll and found it very enjoyable.  I will definately use this again, next time I will be sure to add more serrano peppers since I like it a little hotter.
