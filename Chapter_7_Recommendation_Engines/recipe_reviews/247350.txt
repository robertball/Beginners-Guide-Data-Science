These turned out really good. I guess I don't know what long green beans are and have never seen any in the Asian markets. I used fresh green beans and picked the longest ones I could find..lol. After tasting these I decided that I wanted more heat so I added some chile garlic sauce. The one thing I did not care for in the recipe was the addition of ginger. The hoisin sauce has plenty of ginger in it. Other than that this was perfect! Thanks for sharing.
