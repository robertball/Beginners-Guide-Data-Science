This chicken was really wonderful; the smell alone makes it worth cooking.  I cooked mine in the oven on a cake rack set over a cookie sheet, 20 minutes each side at 350. I tried making it again by putting the chicken in a dish and baking but it didn't turn out as well.  If you aren't going to grill it I highly recommend using the cake rack/cookie sheet method.  UPDATE 6/29/07: I cooked the chicken on the grill for the first time the other night and it was so amazing I upgraded this to 5 stars.  I will still make it in the oven in the winter, but this chicken is amazing when made on the grill.

I have been pleasantly surprised at how good this recipe has been.  I use boneless, skinless thighs and bake for 25-30 min. at 350 degrees in the oven, uncovered.  Perfectly moist and juicy.  Don't bake any longer or thighs will get dry.  (I'm baffled at all these posts that say they bake for 1 hour)  The first time I made these to a T, and it was fantastic, but the long complicated barbecuing was a little tedious.  And since then, I've just baked it in the oven - the last 5 minutes I put on broil to brown a little bit.  And don't wipe the marinade off completely.  It makes a nice thin sauce when it's cooked that's awesome over rice.  Tip - you can also substitute vanilla yogurt for the plain by adding 2-3 tablespoons lemon juice.  Tastes just as good.  Try this recipe - very aromatic and delicious.

The aroma of this dish cooking makes your mouth water!
I used boneless/skinless thighs, as my other half can't stand bone-in anything.  I also used fat free yogurt and sea salt rather than kosher.  For melt-in-your-mouth chicken, make sure you marinate it overnight.  I cooked it to perfection on a broiler pan for 40 minutes in a 350 degree oven - outstanding!

We have made this chicken twice in the last week.  Each time we have made 1/2 of the recipe.  The first time it did not turn out very well (dry, not too tasty), but I blame us: learning to use indirect heat on the gas grill, only using a sprinkle of salt in the marinate, and using natural thighs.  The second time the chicken was EXCELLENT, but this time I added 1/2 tsp. salt to the marinate, marinated them for 2 days in a covered glass dish, grilled them on indirect heat (410 degrees) for 35 minutes without lifting the lid, and they were done, juicy, tasty, and TO DIE FOR.  Don’t know if it made a difference, but these thighs were 9- percent injected with broth.  Will make this many more times while the weather is SO hot.  Don’t give up if they are not great the first try!!!

If you LOVE Tandoori chicken, you'll only sort of like this recipe as the marinade does not have nearly enough spice to flavor the chicken.  If I made this recipe again, I'd double the garlic, drop the cinnamon and cloves and use 2 T Garam Masala instead, and add 2T of lime juice.

Having been to India, and living in Malaysia which has a very large Indian population, I know good Tandoori.  This is an excellent recipe, considering you are not using a Tandoor oven.  We made it for the 4th of July with fragrant rice. MMMMM

I took another reviewer's suggestion and left the marinade on and baked the chicken in the oven at 400F for 25 minutes. It came out juicy and tasty, but was much wetter than the chicken tandoori I've ordered at restaurants. I will definately make this again. Use bone in/skin on thighs & add spices to marinade.

Wow, this was a great recipe - Incredibly flavorful and fragrant! I served the chicken with jasmine rice (sprinkled with fresh cilantro) and garlic naan purchased from Trader Joe's. This recipe's a keepah! :)

Excellent!  Spicy, moist and juicy.  I had to try this recipe out before I sprang it on guests so I broiled it in the oven - about 20 minutes each side.  Yum!  Today I will be doing the Father's Day grilling thing and expect it will be as good or better.  Thank you.  This will be part of my repertoire.

This was really good. I did add some lemon juice to the marinade, and I like spicy food so I used hot paprika, but it still wasn't spicy enough. I might add an extra tbsp. next time, as I will definitely make this again!

Excellent flavor Diana!  Followed the recipe except that I did not have the ground cloves.  Baked my thighs in the oven w/o wiping off marinade.  Chicken was deliciously tender and flavorful!  Thanks for the recipe!

I would give this recipe more than 5 stars if I could. Every once in a while you find something that can be added to your top 10 and this one will! I changed it to 2 servings and used one six oz container of greek yogurt and added a pinch of cayenne. I cooked the thighs in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes and finished them on the grill. I did not wipe off the marinade before cooking. I served them with cucumber raita and chickpea tomato and red onion salad from this site.

Amazing! I loved the flavour! AND I stuck to the recipe other than maybe increasing the garlic because I am an insane garlic lover. So good - definitely will become a regular as I learn to expand my spices in my pantry. Thanks!!

This was awesome, I used boneless skinless thighs and used my baking cooling rack over a cookie sheet as a grill in the oven at 425 for 25 minutes and they tasted just like they had been grilled on the bbq (it's -30 here right now and a foot of snow). They are not super spicy so some might like to add some cayenne for heat but they were perfect for us.  I had no yogurt so substituted sour cream, seemed to work fine.

Awesome receipe!!! I used buttermilk instead of yogurt. And I didn't have cloves so I added anlittle curry and cayenne pepper. My thighs were bone in so they were super juicy! DH said "save this for sure". UPDATE::: I made with chicken breasts. I let my chicken sit for 48 hours in the yogurt mixture. My chicken was juicy and full of flavor. I made simple spiced rice and DH cut up his chicken, threw some with the rice onto pita bread.  He drizzled Greek Taziki I made from AR on his "Indian burrito". Such a wonderful recipe!!!

surprisingly easy and tasty.  still felt like it was missing something but will make again.  May try and increase the spices next time and add some cayenne for a little heat.  very good starter though.  Chicken was very moist and tender.

Tasty, Flavourful, Perfect and NO hassle to prepare at all. That's my description of this recipe. I didn't change a thing apart from halving the qty as I was making it for just 4 of us...although I do now wish I'd made more (coz everyone was very willing to eat more than 2 per person!!!) I marinated this just after dinner the day before yesterday, and baked this in my oven a whole 24hours later for dinner. I'd love to try to bbq and/or grill these but according to me, they're lovely baked. We like our chicken well cooked so it took me almost an hour ( @ 170C) to reach the colour that I was looking for. Also, like another reviewer suggested, I used the cookie rack/cookie sheet method to bake these. Oh and one more thing, I didn't exactly wipe off the marinade ... and I would say you don't need to as long as youve foiled the cookie sheet below so that all excess just drip off into the sheet....leaving the marinade on the chicken whilst cooking will ensure that the flavour really 'sticks' onto the chicken! Thanks for this yum quick fix Diana!

These are UNBELIEVABLE! This is the only way I do chicken on the grill and it comes out great everytime.  They dont have to marinate long at all at all.  Juicy and flavorful!

Love this recipe! What a wonderful combination of spices and the yogurt is a healthy and moist way to hold the complexity of these flavors together. Typically I marinade my meat in a container or long covered pan but putting the chicken in the plastic bag and sealing the air out was an excellent method. I did barbecue the chicken enough to sear it but I wasn't eating until several hours later so I then finished it off in the oven slow cooking it at 250 degrees. It was delicious. I am tempted to make some of the sauce to put on top the last few minutes of the cooking process. This is excellent without but I love the sauce and the spices! I had a blast making this Indian dish. It's so much fun cooking foods from other cultures. I served this for company and everyone loved it. It will be back on our dinner table again for sure! Thanks Diana F for sharing a delicious Indian dish with all of us!

Really good grilled or baked!  Marinade overnight (or longer) is a must.  Also play around with the spices -- I'm not too crazy about cumin, I only used 1tsp, and totally omitted the cinnamon.  And sprinkled more salt while grilling.

This is wonderful!!  This is the first time that I have tried tandoori and I will definitely make it again!  I used boneless / skinless chicken thighs and cooked it on a grill.  Served it with some basmati rice and will probably have the leftovers in a sandwich.  Thanks!

Okay, we LOVE Indian food. This had some excellent spices to it, but it lacked the kick we are used too. I will make this again, but will add some cayenne pepper and maybe more ginger. Tumeric might be added as well. But, the overall taste was very authentic.

This recipe is the bomb!  I took this to a bbq potluck and it stole the show over even the rosemary lamb chops and carne asada.  I didn't even bother to wipe off the marinade and spray with olive oil and it was fine on the grill.  However i did add just a touch of canola oil to the marinade.  This will be made many times in the near future.

I've lost my favorite tandoori chicken recipe, so I thought I'd give this one a go. I marinated the thighs for 24 hours, but the flavor was way too mild, and was missing something. I guess I'll keep looking. Thanks anyway.

This is good, but I like the tikka masala recipe from this website, which is basically the same this as this one, but it has sauce.

Yum! I omitted the cloves (didn't have it) and used sour cream rather than yogurt. Baked in the oven and then broiled for last few minutes. Nice and crispy skin. Topped with chopped cilantro, green onion and lime juice to brighten it up.
My husband noticed the cinnamon but it was not over powerful. Thanks for a great new recipe to add to my lineup. Served with wild rice and sauteed veggies.

It was easy and yummy. I baked my chicken, didn't wipe off the marinade and added a little cayenne for a spicier flavor. Thanks for this great recipe!

I liked it more than the fiance.  I think the marrinade needs to find a way to permmiate a little more as it doesn't leave a lot on the chicken.  I might try poking it w/ a fork a few times next time to try to help it out and maybe thin it  down a touch w/ a little oil

I made this as written, and it was GREAT!  The only thing I didn't do was wipe off the chicken before I threw it on the grill.  Very good, my husband has already asked when we are going to have this again.

really good.  I marinated the chicken overnight. Very easy recipe, very tender chicken.  Couldn't convince my husband to gril outside (too cold) so i baked it on a wire rack 350 for about 35 minutes for my chicken breast and 45 for the thighs.  Will definitely make again.  Skin was very crispy, even though my husband is the only one who eats skin. I thought taking the marinade off the chicken would reduce the flavor but it didn't.

I made this for company and everyone loved it.  I followed the recipe, but also added a couple boneless skinless chicken breast to the mix as one of my guest only eats white meat. The marinate really kept the breast from drying out during grilling. I eat a lot of Indian food out and this recipe seems to have more cinnamon, than tandoori chicken I've had before, but was still delicious. Will definately make again.

Easy recipe results in very juicy chicken, but needed just a little more kick.  Go heavy on the spices and add a teaspoon of cayenne pepper.  Garnish with lemon wedges. - Richard

I plan to try this recipe as it looks quite tasty. However, I must point out that all experts in food safety warn against rinsing chicken or other meats. Doing so does not kill bacteria and only serves to spread it onto other kitchen surfaces.

A definite must try recipe! These were absolutely juicy and full of flavor. I marinated skinless thighs for 12 hours and baked them for 20 minutes in a 425F oven before resting for 10 minutes. This helps it become more tender!

I made this with my Marsha. Absolutely delicious I tell you. Never have I known a chicken thigh to be so tender and moist. Succulent, yet hearty. The secret to this Recipe is the use of indirect heat. Marsha and I have a thee burner grill. I placed the far left burner on med/ high and placed the thighs over to the right with the burners off. This method worked like a charm. What more could you want a tender tandoori and a beautiful gal.

This was good.  I baked it in the oven and it had a nice flavor.  I halved the recipe and still decreased the amount of ground cloves even more.  I think for my families tastes that if I were to make this again, I would not add any cinnamon.  Thanks for sharing.

Made this and Simmi's tandoori chicken recipes for comparison; I followed the recipes pretty closely.  I  used greek yogurt in lieu of regular plain yogurt.  I baked the chicken at 400F for an hour on a rack over a cookie sheet; I used dark meat only with skin on.  I prefer this recipe as it is more flavorful (the cinnamon, clove, and coriander helped amp up flavor and color).  I served chicken with garlic naan from Trader Joe's (frozen section, made in India).  Yum!

so tender and flavorful. Remember to cut the salt in half if you are using table salt rather than kosher. Definitely use fresh ginger - powdered is not the same flavor. The only substitution I made was by using 6 tsp garam masala in stead of 2 tsp each cumin, cinnamon and coriander. I added an additional dash of cinnamon too because that spice is not as prominent in my particular masala blend.  Turned out fabulously - served with guferati indian green beans and curried rice pilaf.

I can't speak for the actual chicken, but the marinade is delicious and it smell wonderful. My bf and his buddy loved it. Said it was very moist and flavorful. I seared on higher heat for 2 m/side as directed, then closed the grill and cooked on lower heat, turning occasionally until the chicken was just done, maybe 25 m? I just kept checking it. It was a hit! Will be making again!

I made this for dinner last night and my family LOVED it, they asked me to make this recipe again!  I followed the recipe exactly except I only had a  coriander/sesame mix, but I don't think it made a difference, and I added a little fresh squeesed lemon juice to the marinade. I left the chicken thighs and marinade in zipper bag overnight in the fridge, patted off excess with paper towels before grilling.  I have a small grill so I didn't have the ability to turn off a burner for indirect grilling, so I grilled direct for 2 mins each side, then I turned the grill down to low and grilled the remaining time on the upper raised rack of the grill, then I cooked the final couple of minutes on direct heat again as recommended when grilling with the skin on.  I didn't have olive oil spray, so I drissled the olive oil over the chicken and brushed it lightly to cover both sides when placing them on the grill.  The skin turned out crispy with a beautiful color, and very juicy and tender on the inside, with lots and lots of flavor!   I served with grilled asparagus (blanch for 2 mins in boiling water, thread onto skewers, brush with balsamic vinegar, and grill for 2 mins each side after removing the chicken, remove asparagus from the skewers and lightly salt). I also served with brown rice accented with cilantro and lime.

Honestly my family found this to be bland. Perhaps we are used to spicier curries, but I would suggest turning up the heat.

Excellent, excellent, excellent!! My husband's Indian, but tandoori chicken isn't among the recipes I've inherited from his mom. This was fabulous. After marinating, I briefly placed the thighs on my stovetop grill pan to partially blacken it and get the grill marks. I then baked it in the oven on a rack in a roasting pan for about 40 minutes at 375. The whole family loved them.

This is pretty good, but you can get the same flavor using Chinese Five Spice and minced garlic.  I'd keep the yogurt in the recipe to contain moistness.  This is great on wings.

I think this has defenite potential to be a 5 star. I used chicken breasts and marinated them for 4 hours or so. I used our George Foreman grill and they turned out moist and yummy. I accidentally went a little heavy on the cloves, so that flavor ended up being a little strong. You can tweak the spice amounts to suit your taste. I din't wipe any of the sauce off before grilling. Very tasty.

Made this delicious Tandoor Chicken with Chicken Tenderloins on a cast iron pan on the stove top.  Came out great and will make more next time for leftovers.  The amount we made was all gone!

This was amazing!!! It didn't say if I was supposed to remove the skin, but I did as I only had 6 hours to marinate. The best grilled chicken on the grill I've ever had, and everyone really liked it, and the rest of this family is not a fan of meat with bones in it. (So annoying)

I baked this because I did not have access to a grill. I marinated 3 drumsticks overnight and swiped off the excess marinade before placing them on a cookie tray in the oven. Baked at 210 deg C for 50 minutes, and they came out so juicy and wonderful. The skin was crispy and tasted fantastic. This is really good, but does not taste like a tandoori dish. Will make again because I love the flavor. Also pretty much an effortless meal. Thanks for sharing!

I'm giving this 4 stars even though this turned out bad for me! I used greek yogurt which was very thick. Since other reviewers said they did not wipe the marinade off before cooking I thought it'd be fine but...WAY to much spice was stuck to that yogurt and thus made the grilled chicken way too strong in flavor. I felt like I was getting a mouthful of cloves and cinnamon. I think I would try this again someday but I would use regular yogurt which is easier to wipe off (and I would then wipe it off!). I also think I'd cut the salt in half. Too bad this didn't turn out :(

I had never tried any thing like this before. I buy my boneless thighs in bulk so I was looking for a recipe that did involve opening a bottle of BBQ sauce. I LOVED it. My whole family loved it. I served with cocnut-lime rice, and sauteed summer squash. Delicious!

I made this with chicken tenderloins instead (as that is what we have) and it is still good. The spices add lots of flavour to this dish.

I only used this recipe for the bbq ing instructions. For the undirect time i put the thighs on one half of the bbq and the burner only on medium on the other half. The cook time wasn't long enough at this setting. But, a fter a bit of extra time (about 20 minutes or more) they turned out great.  Next time, try the whole recipe, it looks great.

Before marinating, I made a spice rub with garlic and onion powders, black pepper and paprika and gave the chicken a good massage. I only marinated for four hours but the wonderful flavors came thru beautifully. I used thighs and legs which I cooked on my stove top grill, however, as soon as the weather warms up, you can be sure this will be going on the outdoor grill. It was wonderful  Diana and we thank you!

Made this last night and it was yummy.Modified it to spice it up.  Doubled all the spices and added cayenne, half a jalapeno, garam masala, and chili powder. Only had time to marinate for 7 hours.  Cooked on the grill as directed.  We all loved it!

Fixed as written, except cooked in the oven at 350 degrees for 25 minutes, then turned and cooked for another 15. Also used boneless, skinless chicken thighs. Meat was VERY tender. My husband thought they were good, I thought they were rather bland. Next time will add more garlic and maybe a little heat, like red pepper flakes or some hot sauce. Quick and easy...thanks!

Very good. I'll definitely make it again.  I marinated it for 10 hours in the refrigerator and used bone in thighs. Next time I will leave it for 24hours and use boneless thighs. It has a very nice taste, but if you are looking for spicy, this isn't the recipe to use.

I ended up not grilling out so I cooked the marinaded chicken in a crockpot (I have no doubt that this would have been better on the grill). Is great served with pineapple rice.

This was very good!  We enjoyed it immensely.  I followed the recipe to a "T" except my yogurt was vanilla.  Had plenty of flavor.  It didn't take quite as long as suggested, but that could be our heat was a little higher.

Ugh, this turned out incredibly dry with a odd, unappealing flavor. The skin burnt to a crisp and had to be removed before the chicken could be eaten. I definitely will not try this one again.

This is an amazing grilled chicken dish. I used light sour cream instead of yogurt and it turned out fabulous. I did the 2 minutes on each side over direct heat, then transfered to the top rack of my grill, closed the lid, turned the heat down and let it slow cook for 30 minutes. It was so tender. Enjoy!  UPDATE!! Make extra! We chopped up the chicken with some celery, green onions, slivered almonds and mayo and had chicken salad sandwhiches...best I've ever had...

Made the recipe for dinner guests and everyone really liked the dish.  Definitely will make again. I stuck to the recipe ingredients as given, but did not completely wipe off the marinade before grilling and did not spray with olive oil spray, which I didn't seem to need. I grilled the chicken as I always do without the indirect heat method which seemed like a lot of bother. Served with Indian Rice (Pulao), Raita (Indian Salad) also from Allrecipes.com and precooked Naan bread purchased at the grocery store.

fantastic!!!  i used boneless/skinless chicken thighs and left them to marinate for 2 days (kind of forgot about them) and then did them on the grill---wonderful!  my husband raved about them...i think next time i'll add a bit of citrus (lime or lemon), and more garlic and ginger as well as some heat from somewhere...these are going to be a staple at our house!!!  thank you!

I made as directed with the exception of marinade time.  Mine only marinated for 3 hours.  It was very good.  We were pleased with it and will maybe make again.

Excellent!  With this Recipe I ommited the Coriander because I didnt have it on hand but did add a tsp if cayanne pepper as some others suggested.  I also slow roasted at 200 degrees F for two hours, while covered with aluminum foil then I uncovered and raised the temp to 400 for about 20-25 min.  Even my 2 year old loved it.  We will definatly make it again.

Excellent!  I halved the recipe as I only had half the amount of chicken thighs.  I used all of the spices and marinated the chicken for a couple of hours and baked it uncovered in the oven on convection @ $425 for 25 minutes. I served it with plain basmati rice and a chickpea/tomato dish from this site.  Very good.  I will definitely make again and do it on the barbecue.

This was good although I couldn't use the grill since it's winter right now.  I baked in the oven, and chicken was moist and had a nice flavor, but I think on the grill would be 5 stars.

Marinade was something I would use again, but I would not use chicken thighs.  I will try again on chicken breats to eliminate the bones and skin that detracted from the meal itself.  I loved the use of yogurt in the marinade.

This is my new favorite tandoori chicken recipe.  I didn't have fresh ginger and used dried ground instead.  I also added 2 tsp of cayenne pepper, but otherwise followed the recipe as written.  I grilled it on a gas grill and served with Indian Basmati Rice from this site and steamed lemon broccoli.  Will definitely make this again.

DO NOT WIPE OFF THE MARINADE!!! Why would you want to do that???  Just be careful when you BBQ that you don't let it burn!

This recipe is very good, smells delicious and has great flavour. I made it as per recipe, but I scored the thighs twice before putting them in the marinade, rubbing it into the  meat. Refrigerate overnight and cook on the BBQ at 325-350.
A great accompaniment is 1/2 cup plain greek yogurt and 2 tablespoons of chopped cilantro and 1 Tbsp of good olive oil. Mix gently in a bowl and serve on the side  along  with some basmati rice... you won't be sorry you tried this recipe!!!

There is a tandoori seasoning you can buy that makes it red.  Garnish with cilantro and pickled red onion.  Who needs to cook 16 pieces of chicken?  Meat temp 160, not 180.

Probably one of the best chicken dishes I've ever eaten, let alone made myself. Greek yogurt made this so so moist. I think you could just use Chinese 5 spice, as it contains most of the required spices. So good!!

I would give this 10 stars but my family had mixed feelings. I used balsamic vinegar because that's what I had on hand.  I don't feel it need any added salt.  Definitely take the lid off near the end to let the sauce reduce and thicken.  I served this over plain rice and scooped some sauce on the rice.  Yum!

My wife and I loved my version of this (lol)! Couldn't find plain yogurt so I used low fat vanilla; forgot the cloves; I happened to have Tandoori spice mix so I used 3 tablespoons of it instead of the paprika, cumin, cinnamon and coriander; and because we thought that the guests that were supposed to come over would not like the dark meat, I used breast meat (slicing the breasts in half). It marinated for 24 hours. I'll be happily eating this for the first part of the week...

These turned out wonderfully!  It almost tasted like we picked up takeout.  I couldn't grill due to rain, and I wasn't able to get thighs, but did use breasts cut into smaller pieces.  I baked these at 400 until they were tender.  Serverd with Naan and rice, and it was a fantastic dinner.

This recipe was delicious. Following a suggestion, I left the marinade on and baked. My son actually licked the sauce from his plate! I was much more refined and used my dinner roll. LOL.

Made this for a cookout last night.  It is an excellent recipe.  Followed the recipe exactly, except used smoked paprika instead of regular paprika and added some lemon juice.  Let the chicken marinade for about 24 hours, and it was extremely tender.  Had no leftovers at all.

We don't have access to a grill, so we put this is a glass pyrex and baked for about 20 minutes on each side, for a total of 40 minutes. We set the marinade for only about 5 hours, and it still came out pretty good. The next time we make this it will be broiled to get the skin more crispy, and we'll add something to give it a bit more kick. Overall pretty good, looking forward to our next rendition.

AFTER MAKING QUITE A FEW TIMES WE DECIDED WE DID NOT LIKE THIS RECIPE!!!!! I really liked this recipe.  I cooked in oven covered for 30-45 minutes with all the sauce on it.  Then I put on grill to just get the flavor.  I didn't have coriander but it didn't seem to make any difference.

made as written except no ground cloves, didn't have any.  i agree with others that the cinnamon was a little strong, but it didn't bother me.  i used boneless, skinless thighs and cooked on the stove top.  i find that after i hand trim the thighs sometimes they are not easily grilled.  thanks for the post diana!

I made the recipe just as directed.  It is delicious and easy.  This definitely moves to the top of my grilling menus.  I served it with basmati rice and grilled vegetables.

I made this with skinless, bone-in chicken breasts on the grill. Made it with nonfat plain Greek yogurt, because that is what I had. It was delicious, moist. Great flavor. This recipe made enough to use in salads. Served with snap peas with mint from this site. Outstanding!

I just made this for the second time and again my husband and I really enjoyed it. The scents coming from the grill are mouthwatering, and it was so easy once I gathered the necessary spices. To be honest Tandoori is a bit dry for my personal taste as I prefer things a bit saucier, but this has wonderful flavor & the thighs stay nice and moist. I might try cooking with the sauce and in the oven as recommended in another review, but again that's just me. Great recipe, thanks!

I made this tonight, but had chicken breasts (boneless, skinless) and didn't have ground coriander.  I halved the chicken breasts and used crushed coriander seed.  My husband and kids loved the recipe (even my 14 year old son)!  I also had to bake this in the oven (about 30 minutes) and didn't marinate as long.  The chicken was tender and delicious.  I've saved this to my recipe box for the future!

I decided to try this recipe based on the reviews even though I was a little leery of the combination of the ingredients.  I'm so glad I did.  It was wonderful.  Followed the recipe exactly and was not dissapointed.

We were really underwhelmed by the flavor on these.  May try and play around with it to see if we can make it work since we all thought it was interesting and had potential.

These where very good....not usually a fan of chicken thighs, but, I would definitaly make these again.  They come out so moist & flavorful.  I only had 10 thighs for the amount of marinate in recipe & the amounts where fine.  Made the Curried Rice Pilaf from AR and it was a perfect compliment.

The yogurt makes the chicken very moist and the marinade permiates the meat well. The flavors are strong, so if you are not a fan of spices in this recipe, you probably won't like this. When I made this, I reduced the amount of yogurt to what I had (about half as much), also reduced cinnamon by half (not a fan) and added chopped cilantro and a squeeze of lemon juice. "Grilled" this on a grill pan for about 10 min; the end result was moist and flavorful. Have made several times since and will make again.

my husband and i loved it!  i used half the salt and didn't have any coriander, but the flavor came out wonderfully.  i browned the chicken then popped them in the oven, but next time i'll prob just do oven then broiler.  a keeper for sure.  so easy to throw together and the flavor is nicely complex.

I used 2 containers of Greek yogurt (which came out to 14oz instead of 12), and I forgot to buy ginger, so I used 2 teaspoons powdered ginger instead.  When I tasted the marinade, it tasted really bitter, so I added 2 Tablespoons lemon juice and 1 Tbsp sugar and I thought it was a bit less bitter tasting.  I only marinated for 4 hours too.  The chicken came out great regardless.  Really fantastic, moist, flavorful chicken!  I think this is a fabulous recipe that can be played with.  The chicken turns out wonderful!

Very yummy!  I used legs and thighs and baked them in the oven (about 40 minutes) with a little finishing time under the broiler.  Thanks to the poster that suggested putting lemon in the marinade since my husband bought vanilla yogurt "isn't it the same as plain?"  *sigh*  The juices made a great sauce for basmati rice on the side.  Loved this recipe-the whole house smelled divine!!  Will make again and again!

Finger-lickin chicken, I've made it twice now: once with boneless chicken breasts and on the grill, the second time with boneless thighs in the oven. The grill really makes a huge difference, but it was pretty good in the oven, too! Obviously boneless cooks a lot quicker, and tastes just as good!

Followed the recipe spices exactly.  Smells wonderful while cooking, and they taste delicious!  I baked mine in the oven at 350 degrees/40 minutes in a broiler pan, and didn't bother spraying with oil because thighs have enough fat in them to keep them from sticking to anything.  I will make this again for sure!

This was very good!  I made it just as the recipe instructed, except that I baked at 350 for about 50 minutes.  I think it could benefit from a full 24 hour + marinade time, though.  I served it with Cranberry Couscous from this sight.  Lovely combo!

I have made this twice.  The first time I omitted the paprika (not a big fan) and the second time  I made it "as is" but used chicken breast.  I loved it the first time.  The meat was flavorful and moist.  The second time the chicken breast were good, but as can happen with chicken breast, a little dry.  Also, I knew I did not like paprika and it gave the dish a strong flavor that I just didn't care for.  I will make this part of our "regulars" and adjust the spices my way... again it was very good and everyone, even my very picky husband, loved it.

First time eating chicken Tandoori. Rated 5 stars because there's certainly nothing wrong with the recipe. I am one of "those" who doesn't like sweet with sour or fruit with meat, and cinnamon & cloves with meat isn't high on my list either. But if you don't try it, you'll never know...right? Neither DH or I were a fan of the smell. He said it was "gross" and all I could smell was cinnamon. Now I love the smell of cinnamon but I wasn't anticipating cookies coming out of the oven either. Also rated 5 stars because, surprisingly, I enjoyed the taste. DH does like sweet & sour and fruit with meat, but didn't like this chicken at all. Go figure. Nothing to blame but personal taste though. It's minus 28°C outside so I baked 8 chicken legs in the oven at 350°F for 45 minutes, uncovered, in the marinade. They were cooked perfectly. I'd like to try this recipe minus the cinnamon and cloves. It's not really chicken Tandoori anymore, but I think we might like it.

The flavor was good (I ended up marinating for 2 days). I think I need to learn more about 'indirect' heat..i.e. turn the middle burner off, not just down! The outside was black. I'd give it another try and I think it would turn out much better.

Good.  I thought it could have used a little more spice.  Marinated for just under 8 hours, so maybe more time would have increased the flavor.

I made this last night and it was wonderful. I baked it since our BBQ broke the night before and it was wonderful. I had skinless thighs which produced little fat. We chopped up some tomatoes and added them to the last 5 minutes of cooking. It was wonderful. We served it over rice with peas. Very healthy and very yummy. Now I gave it 4 stars because I love hot spices, I might add cayenne next time to add a kick.

Good! I added a little cayenne and baked it in the marinade. served it with rice of course. Next time will bake on a rack as others suggested and add a little lemon juice. Easy, fast recipe other than the marinating time.

I baked my chicken at 350 for an hour, threw in a couple of breasts and some drumsticks and this was to DIE FOR!  GREAT RECIPE!!  So fast and EASY!  Next time will be sure to grill the chicken but followed everything else to the letter and the chicken was moist and delicious!

I had high hopes for this recipe.  After reading all the great reviews, I thought it would this recipe would be a hit.  It wasn't bad, it just didn't have any flavor.  I had the chicken marinading all day, and followed the recipe as written.  Disappointing, and I wont be making this again.  Sorry!

Awesome! I did not have cloves or coriander, but even without those two ingredients this dish is delicious. I can't wait to try this with them. I marinated for 24 hours, did not wipe the marinade from the thighs, grilled on med-high heat for 2 minutes per side then turned grill down to low and cooked an additional 10 minutes. The chicken turned out so juicy and tasty! A must try!

We enjoyed this a lot. I made it exactly as called for, right down to the fresh grated ginger. I used boneless skinless chicken thighs; the recipe wasn't clear. I grilled on a charcoal grill; sounds like others used a gas grill (if they didn't use the oven). I kept the marinade on the meat (couldn't see the point of taking it off). Next time I might double the marinade and save the other half for mixing with accompanying rice, which I served as a side. I guess b/c my thighs were boneless, they cooked up after about 25 minutes (40 and they would have been way dry). Full disclosure: we've never had Indian food, much less something cooked in a Tandoori oven, so I can't attest to the flavor's authenticity. Nonetheless, I highly recommend this dish!

These are amazing! My hubby thought they were the best thing ever. I keep on the excess marinade- pu them in the oven on a cookie rack and they were juicy and delicious. Had them with cucumber yogurt raita and flavoured, spiced rice.

I didn't grill these but baked them instead.  And I had drumsticks and not thighs.  They turned out GREAT!  Even my small children enjoyed them.  I served them with steamed jasmine rice topped with chopped fresh cilantro.  I pan roasted some broccoli florets, onion and carrot seasoned with fresh ground salt and garlic powder and olive oil.  Terrific and flavorful dish that is a wonderful break from traditional baked chicken.

My husband and I did not like this.  We were very disappointed in the taste. Followed the recipe exactly as stated.  Expected more of a spicy taste.  The only positive comment I can make is that the chicken thighs were very moist.

I have never had Chicken Tandoori, so I thought I would give this a shot. It did not turn out at ALL. I do quite a bit of cooking, and get most of my recipes from this site. I will share what I did, so maybe someone else will benefit from my "mistakes." First, I used boneless skinless chicken breasts because that is what I had on hand. I did not have paprika or ginger, so those ingredients were omitted. Based on another review, I made the chicken in the oven, baking at 350 degrees for about 30 minutes, and turned on the broiler for the last five. The chicken was very unappealing to look at, and I did not care for the flavoring at all. Again, I had no idea what Tandoori tasted like when I made this. This may very well be a good recipe, I just might not appreciate the taste. I do think it would have been better if it had been grilled.

This was amazing!!! It didn't taste exactly like Chicken Tandoori, but it was still fantastic. The only things I changed were I used chicken breasts instead of thighs and I baked it in the oven instead of grilling it. It was perfect!

This is a very flavorful and easy recipe! We will definitely make it again.

I did the spices at 1.5 strength (one of the spice lids popped off and I ended up with too much, so I just compensated equally with all the other spices. But the yogurt amount stayed the same. I did add a wee touch of cayenne for a little back of the mouth heat, but just a touch. And a bit of lemon juice brightened it up and helped the marinade permeate all the way to the bone. The chicken marinated for approximately 16 hours.

Everyone raved about it and it made the most flavorful skin! The hubbster grilled it over high direct heat to crisp things up then moved it to indirect heat. Total cook time was probably about an hour that way, but boy was it good!!

Thanks for the recipe!

I made this chicken yesterday and got rave reviews (ages ranging from 4 to 64).  The only thing I intend on doing next time is to reserve a little of the marinade and brush on towards the end of the grilling.

Excellent recipe! I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and ended up marinating overnight.  The yogurt tenderized the chicken so much that it was practically falling apart before I grilled it.  The spice blend is perfectly aromatic and delicious - I did add a little turmeric for a slightly more yellow/orange color.  Served with Basmati Rice and Peas and Grilled Pineapple slices.

We love Indian and grilling, so this was a sure bet.  We have found that going heavy on the ginger and garlic works well for us.  This has officially been added into the summer dinner rotation - even the kids eat it.

Good but not fantastic.  I felt like it was missing some zing - maybe will serve it with a lemon wedge next time or put lemon zest in the marinade.

First of all, I am not concerned that this wasn't an authentic tandoori chicken recipe or that it wasn't cooked in a Tandoor oven. I was more concerned about pleasing my family. I am happy to say that even the picky eaters were very pleased. This is a very easy and tasty recipe. I will be making this again very soon. Thank you for the recipe!

This recipe is really awesome! I couldn't find any unmarinated chicken thighs at my local shop, so I used boneless chicken breasts instead. I cut them to 3-4 pieces and marinated them for 24 hours. I baked them in the oven (200 C) for 20 minutes, and they were absolute mouth watering! I'll make this again very soon.

This recipe was awsome!  I was a little leery using cinnamon with chicken but all the spices worked wonderfully together.  I saved a bit of the marinade and briefly marinated a "veggie chicken cutlet" just before grilling for my vegetarian daughter and that turned out well, too.  Served the chicken thighs with Fasoliyyeh Bi Z-Zayt (Syrian Green Beans with Olive Oil) also from this site, and some plain rice for a really great meal.  Wouldn't change a thing about the recipe.

Excellent recipe!  I used chicken legs instead of thighs. Instead of turning the legs on the grill at the beginning, I simply put them on my Weber grill, closed the lid and left them for 35 minutes.  The end result was wonderful looking and smelling chicken that was so yummy, even my 1 year old gobbled it up and wanted more!!  I served this dish with carmelized onion and horseradish mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli.

I went a little lighter on the cloves as I always think it can be overpowering. Very delicious chicken. Used boneless skinless thighs and cooked on a griddle outside (Didn't use the indirect heat method as no bone in thigh). Served with rice, curry veggies, and naan bread. Kids and adults all loved it. Definite keeper recipe. Very similar to the taste found in Indian restaurants.

I had to substitute the yogurt with canned coconut milk since that’s what I had on hand.  It turned out great! Had more of a Thai flavor. I also didn’t bother wiping off excess marinated.  This is a keeper!

Fantastic taste and leftover used in stir fry was even better.   No need to make any changes.

So I made this last night for a group of friends and it was fabulous!  I read the prior reviews and did not wipe off the marinade.  I partially cooked it on the grill to get that flavor and finished it off on a low temperature in the oven.  i served it with a vegetable korma and Indian salad because our group included vegetarians.  Everyone was happy!!

I made a few modifications based on other reviews, mainly, I left out the cinnamon and cloves, added extra garlic and some hot pepper. My husband and I both thought it was delicious! I love the idea of using the yogurt for the marinade base and will be trying that technique again for sure!

Wow!  This was delicious!  My husband and son loved it too. I’d make this every day if I could. I made the recipe exactly as stated except I used boneless thighs as that is our family’s preference. I meant to marinate it the night before but forgot so did it first thing in the morning. The thighs were full of flavor and so tender. I served it with naan bread with a bunch of different toppings - cucumbers, tomatoes, kalamata olives, and hummus.

tasted great but I would get the same taste if I used the Tandoori seasoning and not all the mess of marinating.

This was delicious. I fiddled with the spices a bit, as I was working with only six thighs (no easy division with 16 thighs). I went with heavy doses of our favorites, and lighter on others, all the while keeping it on the less spicy side. My husband is I guess morally opposed to well-done meats, so he didn't exactly have the meat falling off the bone! But it was still very tasty. I made white rice and roti to go with it, and we kind of made 'tacos' with the roti, adding the yogurt and fresh cilantro and mint. Really made every bite delicious!

We thought this chicken was delicious! The spice combination made for a very tasty dish! I used the boneless thighs but also threw in a couple of breasts. We baked it for 35 minutes (not good grilling weather) and the chicken was tender and moist. Will be making this all summer long.

Delicious. I didn't have all the spices needed and had to improvise.  I have since ordered them from Amazon much less expensive than the local store.  Very tender and tasty.

Made as written, marinated for about 16 hrs. This was one of my first tries with Indian inspired recipes and it was exactly the outcome I was looking / hoping for!  Took a little longer to grill than stated with my lower btu grill but it came out moist and with plenty of flavor.

I made it with extra yogurt and let it marinade overnight. My husband did not like it, but he does not like change either.
Yes, I would make it again.

I made the receipt as noted. I did leave to to marinade for 24hours and grilled it in my Nuvwave oven for 30 mind,  Too long, next time it will only be 15 to 30 minutes. The flavor was really good.

Huge hit with all ages in the family! Did not manage to marinade for the full 8 hours - probably closer to 5 or 6. I did not wipe off the excess, grilled it indoors on my gas range until I had nice grill marks, and then transferred the chicken to a pan to finish cooking it all the way through. It was very tender, aromatic, and simply delicious. I look forward to making this again soon!

Very nice.. Didn't grill, but put it in the oven at 350 degrees for 25-30 minutes, as someone else suggested.  Very good. I'd probably get rid of a little bit of the sauce, as suggested, next time, and it'd probably be even better. The marinade does its job just fine without keeping it on.

UPDATE: Tried again. Used the ingredients as written. Marinated for 2-days then baked them in the oven at 350 for 40 minutes then broiled for minutes.  I did not wipe them off very much because I wanted the flavor. They turned out really good so changed my 2-star review to 4-stars. 
Previous review - Followed the recipe but the cook time for the grill is way too long/too hot. I laid a piece of foil across the upper grate on my grill and after doing 2 min on each side on the lower grate, I moved them up for indirect heat and set my timer for 20 min to do my first check. They were black bricketts and totally unetable, so we just had rice and corn for dinner. I'm really mad but if I get over it, I might try again and turn the heat off when I move the thighs to the upper shelf. Or, maybe I'll do them in the oven next time.

I grilled this recipe on the Big Green Egg, using direct then indirect heat, as the recipe instructs, and it was outstanding.  I will surely make this recipe many times in the future.  Just enough spice not to overpower side dishes. Excellent with Jasmine rice.

This is an amazing recipe. Marinated chicken overnight... WOW!!! The flavors work so beautifully together. I served with Israeli couscous, pita bread and tzaziki. Making it again (one week later) for dinner party. Serving this time with "Greek potatoes" instead of couscous. One of my all time fave chicken recipes for sure! Thank you!!

Great recipe EXCEPT no true tandoori chicken marinade is complete without a big squeeze of lemon or lime juice. Other than this, I made no modifications. Wonderful result.

I thought this had great flavor, but I did let it marinate for about 30 hours and used skinless thighs. Sour cream also works as a yogurt substitute when it is all you have on hand. The cooking time for me is only about 20 minutes.

4/5/2016: Great taste!  I used boneless chicken breasts cut into 2" slices before marinating.  As per one reviewer's suggestion I didn't wipe the marinade off before grilling.  I only grilled for about 15 minutes total, turning the pieces every 3 minutes and re-arranging to make sure they were grilled evenly.   I reserved the excess marinade and thinned it with a little milk, then brought it to a boil in a small pan...  it make a great sauce, which I served in small bowls on the side, along with rice and steamed broccoli.  I cut my chicken into bite sized pieces and then mixed it with my sauce, rice, and broccoli.  Everybody else just dipped the chicken and broccoli in their sauce.  Either way, we all enjoyed the Tandoori flavor.  8/20/17: made again with chicken breast halves, about 1/2 inch thick. Marinated overnight and just shook off excess marinade, leaving plenty on the chicken before grilling. Should have thought to grease the grill grates because they stuck, but I managed to finish grilling anyway, and boy were they good! Served them whole, and my guests ate them alongside other dishes as is or in a fresh baked hamburger bun.

Wow! What a splendid tasty surprise!  This dish is full of robust flavor.  I made half of the chicken on the grill after marinating only 2 hours and the rest 3 days later; both times the chicken was delicious.  I did add a little curry due to having no coriander at the time. Just remember generously spray both the chicken and the grill to prevent sticking.   Thank you! This is definitely a summer favorite. :). ??

My guests and I thoroughly enjoyed this.  A little salty for me but not to the point of distraction. What a delicious way to serve an inexpensive cut of meat.  Started it on the main grill then moved it up to the warming rack for 30 minutes.

Second try.  Grill broken so cooked it in the oven for 30 min. @ 350, then 5 or 6 min. Under the broiler.  Added 1/4 tsp. cayenne.

Yeah, this is the real deal. Authenticity calls for skinless chicken thighs with the bone in, but if you love crunchy chicken skin, you have to follow your own lights and leave it on. I prefer it with the skin. But there are a few things to keep in mind. 1) If you are grilling skinless, boneless chicken breasts, it's going to be dry. You might as well eat a pile of autumn leaves for all the taste and texture boneless breasts will give you. 2) Tandoori needs live fire. If you're doing it in your oven, it will never be as good. 3) Adjusting grill heat is tricky. You should be able to hold your hand 6 inches above the grate for about 10 seconds before it becomes uncomfortable. At 4 inches above the grate, you should need to take your hand away after 5 seconds. 4) Wind temperature and velocity affect grill heat. If it's a cool and breezy day, put on more charcoal or turn up the heat a little.

I followed DINNERSBYDAPH's recommendation and used garam masala and lime juice, ditched the cinnamon and cloves, doubled the garlic, and cooked the chicken thighs on skewers. Way better than the other recipe.

Unfortunately, I didn't have 8 hours to marinate it so I just let it soak for about 15 minutes and then I sautéed it on the stovetop for about 10 minutes on each side in a tablespoon of avocado oil.  I kept the marinade on it and it crisped up nicely.  What amazing flavor even though I didn't marinate it for as long as the recipe calls for.  I can only imagine the flavor will get better with longer marinating.  Enjoy!

very tasty!  didn't have fresh ginger so had to use dried.. cut the salt in half b/c we only have table salt, but think it could have used a little bit more.. didn't have a lot of time to marinate.. maybe an hour, but the flavors were still very apparent.. ty so much for the recipe

The yogurt marinade is wonderful and keeps chicken so moist. I am about to make it again. Big hit first time. I eyeballed the spices last time and will add way more this time.

Delicious! I had to sub 2 tsps ground ginger for the 2 Tbs grated fresh. Marinated just 8 hours before grilling. Do scrape the marinade off before grilling over coals if you don't want the skin to get blackened (from flames shooting up when the marinade drips down) (having said that, some of us thought the crisp, blackened skin was the best part). Even the kids loved this. If you're used to super-spicy Indian food, though, this may be less to your liking.

Simple and flexible, over the years I've made this recipe on the grill, in the oven under the broiler (need to reduce the heat after a few minutes), and in a slow cooker  (it doesn't get as crispy in the slow cooker but the flavor is lovely, just be sure to use an inset to keep the chicken out of it's own juices).  I have used a premade Garam masala spice blend and I have made the recipe exactly as directed and enjoyed both.  I always leave the marinade on (I missed that step the first time which made my grilling experience less successful but I loved the flavor so repeat it every time). I eat Indian food regularly and I must admit it isn't as good as something I would get from a restaurant but compared to other Indian recipes I've attempted this is EASY and the results are very tasty.  You may need to adjust the seasoning to your taste and you'll want to be sure to use a really good, tart yogurt (I use Greek yogurt), but this is a lovely recipe.

This was an excellent recipe.  I used a fresh cut up chicken and left it in the marinate for 9 hours. For extra kick, I added 1 tsp of cayenne pepper and 2 tbsp of freshly chopped cilantro, and a couple of extra tbsp of fresh ginger.  Served it with plain basmati rice and curried lentils.  Will definately make it again, thanks for sharing!

I think it was terrific....I'm new to cooking (but not to eating) and in general don't like to cook. However, this recipe was soooo good and terrifically easy that I'll no doubt be making it again.

Chicken was very good and moist. I cooked it pretty much as instructed except I didn't wipe off the marinade before grilling and after taking chicken off the grill, I put into a hot oven for about five more minutes to crisp it up a bit. Will make again.

I made this just as the recipe stated, very tender, juicy and quite delicious. Be sure to spray the grill well before grilling as it wants to stick. Other than waiting a day to marinate the recipe is quite easy to make. Ut Oh I remember, I lied, I used turmeric and paprika for color and more flavor rather than food coloring.  Thank you it tastes so authentic. I had a friend who was of this culture and she made it several years ago and this is right up there with what she had made. Great recipe - D-Double-delicious!

Oh ma ga. Slam dunk with this recipe. I did not have the recommended 8-hour marinade window, so I used the ingredients as more of a dry rub on the spot. Wow, in 20 minutes, these thighs came out delicious with a bit of firecracker off the tongue.

I was skeptical about the yogurt but this was fantastic! I did add 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon of curry. Baked it in the oven at 400 degrees until thermometer said 165, approx. 30-40 minutes. Served with Indian Rice with Cashews and Raisins from this site also. I would make this every week!

Really good! I cut the skinless thighs into 1" chunks and marinated 2 hours, then threaded them onto skewers for grilling. Omitted the cloves and cinnamon and added cayenne to suit my taste.  Will make this again and again!

Loved the spice blend.  I marinated for 8 hours and the seasoning was subtle.  Next time I will marinate overnight and see if there is a difference.

My DH was disappointed that this did not taste like tandoori chicken as he was craving some.  I did bake at 400 degrees for 40 min. which cooked them through perfectly.  It tasted okay, just not the tandoori he was hoping for.

These turned out very good. I've cooked bone-in chicken thighs many times and they always come out tender & juicy pretty much no matter how you cook them. I bbq'd mine over direct med-low heat until they were done (about 20min) to speed up cooking time and they were perfect. I thought perhaps there might be a little more tanginess to the chicken from the yogurt but you couldn't taste it at all. But the spices added great flavor and it was a nice change from the usual!

Very authentic. Almost exactly as It's listed in my Indian cook book. Personally, I might increase spice a bit next time. 1/4 tsp cayenne maybe. 
Great dish, worth a try!
