LOVE THIS ICE CREAM!! I have made it four times so far! We liked the lemon flavor but also have made it with half the lemon and added more vanilla, and have also made it using 4 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla only. Great either way, depending on your taste. Very rich and creamy!!

This recipe is delicious!  I loved the thick consistency and the great taste.  I substituted egg nog for half of the 5 cups of milk and everyone loved it!  It was gone in minutes!

I wouldn't really call this a vanilla ice cream because of the significant amount of lemon extract in the recipe. The lemon flavor takes over the vanilla, which tastes good but something to keep in mind. This recipe makes a decent amount of ice cream, so I used the servings calculator and cut the recipe in half. I made the ice cream using the exact amount og ingredients called for except that I cooked the ice cream until thickened because of the eggs in it, which I recommend doing. Just combine all of the ingredients in a saucepan and whisk together for about 10 minutes or so on medium to medium high heat until slightly thickened and allow mixture to completely cool in the fridge before transferring to your ice cream maker.

WOW!!!!  Absolutely the BEST homemade icecream I have ever had!!!!  The only change I made was using all vanilla extract instead of lemon.  My family would give it ten stars if they could!!!  I will definitely be using this recipe again and again. It is also a great vanilla icecream to add mix-ins.  Thanks JEMR2 for a great recipe!!!

Good; however, much too much lemon for our taste. I'll make it again using less lemon and I think it'll be good.

TIP: 
If you mix the milk with the eggs, and heat to a temperature of 160F, it will kill any salmonella that may be present. Do this in advance so the mixture has time to cool, then be chilled in fridge, before combining with remaining ingredients and placing in ice cream maker. Enjoy!

Very good recipe. I left out the lemon and doubled the vanilla extract. I also used whole milk in place of the cream. Will be making again!!

Wow, I love this one!!  The lemon extract gives this a totally unique, unexpected flavor. It's tasty!  If I could give this more than 5 stars, I would.  My family renamed it Lemonilla Ice Cream.  I'll absolutely be making it again.

We really loved this ice cream.  It was so easy to make, and the vanilla flavor was really refreshing.  I thought it tasted a little bit weird with chocolate on it (because of the lemon), but it was delicious enough to stand on its own.  I originally let it ripen in the freezer for a couple of hours, and it was good, but when we tried some a couple of days later, the flavors had really blended and the ice cream was even better than the first time.The ice cream had firmed up, as well.  My ice cream maker is the Cuisinart, so I cut the recipe down to 8 servings.  There was some room in the canister, so I will probably make 11 servings next time.  Overall, the taste is really impressive for the lack of effort needed.

Great basic recipe for vanilla icecream!  I did substitute in more vanilla extract for the lemon extract, and I also added 1 oz. of Amaretto liquer to my milk for added flavor.  I followed the tip to heat the whole milk and evaporated milk (and amaretto) to 175 degrees before adding to the sugar and eggs, and it turned out great!

This is an excellent homemade vanilla ice cream.  I made it this weekend for the second time.  This was for my grandson's 2nd birthday and it was a huge hit.  Be prepared to give out the recipe!

Flavor was good, but the texture was not.  Like other uncooked ice creams, this turned out grainy and melted incredibly quickly.

Very tasty, dense vanilla ice cream. It was a little too lemony for vanilla ice cream, but still very good. Next time, I'll use a little less lemon.

This recipe was super easy and came out perfect. I like others, did not whip the cream before adding. One other change: since I didn't have lemon extract I used almond extract and it came out super delicious. It's like an almond vanilla ice cream with a perfect texture! This is the base ice cream recipe in our home now.

Very easy to make. Lemony taste was strong to me. It made it hard to add toppers to the lemony taste. Will use half lemon extract or replace with Almond next time.

Very good ice cream.  I did have trouble with beating the eggs and sugar "until stiff."  Mine never got stiff even after 8 minutes of beating.  It is probably my fault since I used Splenda and egg beaters.    Ice cream was still very good.  I also went with just 1 tsp of lemon and replaced the rest with vanilla - still very lemony.  Makes a huge batch.

DELISH!!  I love the lemon vanilla flavor.   
I have made this several times, followed the recipe exactly.  Sometimes we substituted the lemon extract with almond extract and added crushed cherries.  This is my go to for homemade ice cream.

I used this recipe for the 4th of July and everyone raved about it. I didn't use any lemon juice but used 4 tsp vanilla instead and added a quart of fresh strawberries. Thanx so much for sharing JEMR2!
