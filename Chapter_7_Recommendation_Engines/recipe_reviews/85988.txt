I wasn't a fan of this recipe at all. There were too many things going, too many flavors or something. I won't make it again, but if you're going to try it, maybe use less onion.
It was a pretty side dish though!

I made this without the shrimp, varying the amounts of  listed ingredients.  Wonderful taste and color!

I can see this served at a summer luncheon.  I omitted the mayonnaise, mostly because I forgot it, but honestly, I don't think it is needed.  I also substituted diced red pepper in place of the black olives to give it some color contrast.  The biggest surprise to me was the peas.  I wasn't sure how well I would like them, but they are a nice addition.  This will be added to my summer repertoire. Thanks for sharing!

Made this as a side dish for ribs and chicken.  Other than omitting the shrimp I followed the recipe and was very happy with the result.  Will be making it again.

This was good. I used red peppers instead of the olives and halved the mayonnaise. Ultimately, I'm not sure all the additions add much, if anything, to the avocado.

I love to make this for dinner it’s easy and quick, this is one of our favorites . I did make it with plain yogurt and it’s very good.
