I followed the recipe as close as I could, only using cow's milk instead of soy milk. This needed about a 1/2 more milk than it called for. I had the same problem that everyone else did with a dense pancake that rose beautifully but struggled to cook and were a little rubbery. I think part of that is that it might have needed even more milk than I added and I had to mix it more than I would have liked to incorporate the extra milk. I'd like to try this again, with a few changes. I think it could be as good as the title states, with the right amount of milk. Kind of a sad day in this house as we're serious pancake worshipers.

Ok Jeff, these are realllly goood.  The only reason i didn't give 5 stars was because the liquid portion is off. I halved the recipe and I had to add a lot more soy milk than called for to get to a consistency that was workable.  Without this modification my batter was like cookie dough.  I didn't have the vanilla powdered creamer but suppose it was accomodated for in the soy milk which was vanilla flavored.  Thank you Jeff, I will definately make these again, perhaps trying a little cardamom

I wondered onto the site this morning looking for a way to jazz up my regular old pancakes and this recipe was just the trick! I left out the creamer, substituted skim milk for the soy and, like other had suggested, doubled the liquid ingredients. They were very yummy! Definitely had to watch them closely as they didn't bubble like regular pancakes do when they're ready to be flipped. Great recipe, will make again!

I rate recipes based on their idea not their exactness so if you're looking for someone who followed the recipe exactly, keep looking.  Had run out of eggs for our usual weekend brunch and had a random box of buttermilk pancake mix and a boyfriend who doesn't like pancakes so I wanted to jazz them up.  I halved the recipe but more than doubled the milk. Used about triple actually (closer to package direction quantity.) And I used skim milk cause that's what I had.  I used straight cinnamon instead of cinnamon sugar and replaced most of the powdered creamer with granulated "vanilla sugar" which I use to top specialty coffees usually.  I used the good stuff for the vanilla extract but doubled it to make up for the creamer.  I used creamed honey... don't know if that's any different but again it's what I had.  I figured more or less the recipe came out the same as if I'd followed exactly (except maybe the milk).  The pancakes were thick but fluffy in texture and absorbed the syrup well.  They didn't bubble but were easy to time on medium heat.  The mixture was thicker than I was used to, even after doubling the milk but it turned out very well.  Boyfriend who hates pancakes asked me to make them again!  This will definitely stay in my cookbook.  Thanks Jeff.

Great recipe...these are a great breakfast treat!  The only problem I found was the soy milk measurements...I had to put alot more than the 1/2 cup. But other than that this was a fabulous idea.

These were very, very yummy.  The kids loved them.  DD said these are the best pancakes she's ever had.  I found myself reaching for more than a couple and I am not a pancake fan.  I used about 1/4 c. liquid hazelnut creamer since that's what I had, and added it to the milk in measuring.  I did use significantly more milk than the recipe called for.  For the cinnamon and sugar, I used them separately and estimated.  I was heavy handed on the sugar.  We will definitely make it again.  Thank you!

The finished product was dry and slightly gritty. I was afraid they were going to be too sweet for breakfast, but they weren't very sweet considering all the sweeteners that are them.

I gave this four stars because I made alterations to the recipe. First, I did not add the French Vanilla powdered stuff, and I used reduced fat milk instead of soy. These alterations resulted in a dense [doubles in height] yet fluffy pancake that tastes great, although it did not 'absorb' the syrup as much as I would've liked. I also did not measure the ingredients, I made this recipe before and the measurements were off so I winged it. =) Hope this helps.

I just used regular milk in this bc that's what we have.  I didn't use water and had liquid creamer so I just poured in some of that.  I also didn't measure the milk but I have to agree with other reviewers who say you need more than 3/4 c of liquid in this.  These are nice little pancakes with good cinnamon flavor.  Thanks!

My boyfriend and I were looking for a pancake recipe that didn't require eggs, and I happen to have soy milk, so this recipe was perfect! We made the pancakes quite a bit bigger than bite sized, and like the other reviews said to do, used a ton more soy milk then called for. They turned out great! Much tastier than plain pancake mix. I'll be sure to use this recipe again and again.

I just made these for breakfast for my two girls who both gobbled them up.  After making a few changes they were really good.  I halved the recipe by using one cup of pancake mix and the full amount of everything else.  I did not have soy milk so I used regular and used ground cinnamon instead of cinnamon sugar.  I would make these again.

The taste was good but I too had to double the soy milk to get the batter to pour. Without doubling the soy milk I had a very thick batter almost like another reviewer stated 'like cookie dough batter'. Other than that they were tasty.

I LOVED this recipe!!!! I doubled the liquid ingredients (and used vanilla almond milk rather than soy) as suggested and added blueberries...better than full fat pancakes made with eggs!!! They were so delicious on their own that they barely needed syrup. I think I may try skim milk next time to lighten it a bit more...

These were pretty tasty! I have never thought of using non-dairy creamed as a flavoring in the batter and it was really nice. I used Cinnamon Vanilla flavored creamer.  I also did not have soy milk and used skim instead.  I had to add an extra 1/4 cup of milk since the batter was way too thick (maybe this has something to do with my substitution).   Not sure I'd use this exact recipe again but they were tasty.

Really tasty! I did have to add more liquid (I added some more creamer and milk until it was to a consistency that I could deal with). Very tasty and about as easy as making instant pancakes. Thanks for the recipe!

Anytime I have tried cooking pancakes with Bisquick batter, no matter what I add, it still tastes like a biscuit.  This is a cinnamon biscuit!

4 stars only because I didn't really make this as-is, I borrowed the idea to jazz up a standard box mix. I made the batch like normal, per the box instructions, but then added the vanilla, honey, sugar, and cinnamon as specified here. They were great!  What a nice way to put a homemade touch on standard Aunt J. Thanks Jeff!
