Perfect antipasto salad! Quick, easy, and zesty. Remember to use a good quality salad dressing, such as the one shown in the receipe (SEVEN SEAS VIVA Italian dressing) or comparable. I recommend this salad to everyone.

I used pepperoni rather than salami.  This is a wonderful full meal salad.  Add some hot bread and it is perfect.  I make it regularly for lunch.  I do prefer to make my own Italian dressing though.

This is a great recipe.  Sort of like a caesar salad but different.  I took this to a family dinner.  My family isn't big on hot things (like pepperocini peppers) so I was nervous if they would like it.  I cut the peppers up small and you barely notice them but it adds the flavor still.  Everyone loved this salad!  Even my picky grandma who won't eat anything spicy.

I used grape tomatoes, feta cheese, and ham instead of some of the ingredients.  And used balsamic vinegar instead of Italian dressing.  I guess it's a different salad but everyone loved it.

I use pepperoni instead of salami.  Add 1 tsp sugar to dressing.  I have made this salad for several dinners and everyone loves it, even people who say they do not like salad eat this!  A special salad without lot of effort.

This was one of the easiest and quickest salad recipes I have made. It is delicious as is, but I did use the sliced mild banana pepper rings instead of the pepperoncinis. They seem to be a bit milder for kids. The first time I used the called for dressing amount which was slightly to much, so make sure to add gradually to suit your taste. At times,I have substituted pepperoni for the hard salami, only because it is cheaper than a good quality hard salami. I do prefer the flavor of the hard salami, though. I also used the new mozzarella cheese crumbles instead of the shredded type. It didn't change the taste but did add a slightly new texture that I enjoyed. A very colorful and attractive salad. Thanks!

This recipe is easy to put together and is a great compliment to the minestrone soup recipe I found at this site.

A good basic recipe.  I omitted the pepproncini.  Added cherry tomatoes.  This is good for a shower or party as well.

Great idea for something different than my usual dinner salad.  I omitted the salami and added purple onions to serve as a side dish with an italian entree.  Very good!!!

Easy and a nice alternative to the same old salad.  Great with any Italian meal.  The only downside is a lot of people don't like olives or pepperoncini peppers, so you can expect some to be picked out.

Gave the ingredients a couple of whirls in the food processor to make a chopped salad before adding dressing. Delicious.

Very good and easy to whip up!  I used the suggestion of adding sugar (I used Splenda) and it was yummy.  It took the "bite" out of the dressing.
