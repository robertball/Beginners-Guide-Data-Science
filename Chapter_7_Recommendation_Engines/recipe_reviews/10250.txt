Unfortunately I didn't read the reviews before making this recipe.  These cookies turned out too flat and burned on the edges.  And I agree with the other review that said that there was too much butter as well.  I was very disappointed with the results.  I would not recommend this recipe.

Somthing is wrong with this recipe. A half cup of butter to 2 cups of mix plus the egg was way too much butter. What happened!

Using the basic mix really cuts down on the time.  It's easy to put together.  Drop the cookies or form them into balls but don't flatten or the edges will burn.  Crispy and Chewy.

Flavour wasn't bad but cookies flattened too much and came out hard tried adding more flour ingredients but didn't make much of a difference.

This cookie certainly is basic nothing like grandma used to make. It is not as moist and not as chocolatey and goey. It is pretty dry but they also could be worse. They certainly arent the worst ive ever tasted... and they are easy and quick. Nothing special nothing horrible...

I agree with the other this recipe is not quite right. Here are my changes: 1 stick margarine 4 cups cookie mix 1 1/2 tsp vanilla 1/4 cup of shortening 3 eggs 1 cup choco chips: then these turned out great! I agree the basic mix does make tings easier.

Reduced butter to 6 Tb next time will try 5. Very very sugary like crystallized sugar cookies with chocolate chips. They do flatten out a lot while baking. Just short of 12 minutes they were crispy-soft and not burned in my oven.
