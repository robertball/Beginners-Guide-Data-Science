This peanut brittle is FANTASTIC!!!  Takes awhile to make it but is well worth it.  Don't try to rush it because the final result is not nice...I am guilty of it...you get an everlasting chew toy.

I made this with almonds and walnuts, and it was FLAT delicious!! I agree with whoever said cook the nuts first (in all the ingredients), this was so good, I had to FORCE myself to quit munchin'...and I don't usually like candy....

Tried this recipe twice exactly as written and both times it went from liquid to burnt. As always, be wary of people who list something as 5 stars and then proceed to mention 17 changes they made.
