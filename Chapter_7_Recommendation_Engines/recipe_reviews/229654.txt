I did make a few changes. I eliminated the mayo. I dislike it and, I typically don't eat Waldorf salad because of the mayo. I only used Winesap apples, a tart red/green apple, for the sweet/tart contrast. I used black grapes and doubled the cranberries (mixed in) for the color. I loved the salad. The leftovers were my lunch for 2 days after our Thanksgiving dinner.

Loved this recipe (and my husband did too!).  The only thing I changed was pecans for walnuts ~only because I did not have any walnuts on hand; I'm sure the walnuts would of worked great too...  Thx for sharing
