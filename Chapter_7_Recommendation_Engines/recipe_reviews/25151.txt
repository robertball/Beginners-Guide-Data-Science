I couldn't give this a 5 rating because I more than tripled the seasonings (specially the garlic), and I cut back a little on the sugar/ketchup (which is already pretty sweet).  I also cut the vinegar in half. Basically, I used your ingredients and then modified them to our taste.  I read the reviews and most of the people whorated it low complained that is was bland.  I learned from a friend on this site (sdk999) that when you cook in a slow cooker you have to increase your seasonings and I have to agree.

Fantastic!  I bought a roast from M&M meat shops, and defrosted it.  I put potatoes in the bottom, covered by an onion, the roast over that, and filled in the sides of the slow cooker with baby carrots.  I poured the sauce over top and left it alone.

It was FANTASTIC!!  I would definitely recommend this to anyone.  The pork was tender and juicy.  The vegetables were done to perfection!

Loved it!! Made it exactly as written.  Wouldn't change a thing.  I pierced the roast with a fork MANY times so the flavor would soak in.  Wonderful!

I made a lot of changes, so although I thought this was a 5-star dinner, I think it was due to input from other reviewers and some of my own revisions.  I did brown the pork in about 1/2 Tbsp of oil with 1 tsp of butter.  For the sauce I mixed 1.5 cups beef broth, 2 Tbsp of red wine vinegar, 3 Tbsp of soy sauce, 1 Tbsp of white sugar, 1 Tbsp of ketchup, 1 tsp of black pepper, 1/4 tsp of salt (since the beef broth is pretty salty), 1 tsp each of garlic power and onion poweder, 1/2 tsp each of paprika and dry mustard, about 1 tsp of Frank's Red Hot and a dash of worcestershire.  I layered about 8 medium red pototoes (peeled) on the bottom of the crock pot, covered with onions, then put the browned roast on top.  Then I added baby carrots all around the sides.  I cooked on high for about 1 hour, then turned down to low and cooked for another 5 hours.  After 5 hours, I sliced the pork into about 10-12 pieces and put it in the bottom of the crock pot so it would be submerged in the juices.  I cooked for 1 additional hour and then removed all the veggies and pork and kept them warm on a platter.  Then I poured the juice into a pot, added a cornstarch slurry and brought it to a boil to make a gravy.  It was AWESOME!  And pretty healthy too!  Thanks for the great start, K :)

We really enjoyed this, and how convenient it is!  I scrubbed some small red potatoes and put them in the pot whole with the pork, steamed some asparagus to go with it, and voila, an easy and healthy dinner.

I made two very minor changes to the basic recipe.  I used raw sugar instead of white, and substituted some chili infused vinegar for the red wine vinegar.

This is one of those really good basic recipes that you can make so many little changes to and use over and over again.  I'm going to try using hoisin, then teriyaki, in place of the ketchup to see how they change the taste.

I read a few of the different reviews and found them helpful. I cut the roast into four pieces and browned them. From there I followed the ingredients listed in the original recipe and added about 5 red potatoes. I quartered the potatoes and tossed them on top of the roast pieces. I set the slow cooker for 5 hours on low. This is a keeper!

This was a winner, & I found it so easy to prepare.  A great meal for hot weather as you use the crock-pot

I used a small pork roast--about 1-l/2 pounds-- better fit for my small slow-cooker, & it turned out great.  I sliced it and served it on hamburger buns with some of the onions that were cooked with meat, added some barbecue sauce & mustard - & voila! …Hot pork sandwiches!

PS:  A note of caution—the meat comes out of slow cooker pale, so if you want it to look brown, better brown it in a pan before putting it into the crock-pot.  I didn’t do this, but I added teriyaki sauce and later some barbecue sauce over the top to get it “browner”….& of course, those things added to the overall flavor.

Husband loves this recipe.  I used pork chops instead of roast.  I used balsamic vinegar instead red wine and it gave it a nice zip.  I also doubled the recipe for the sauce in order to make a nice gravy.  A+++ recipe a favorite in my house.

This was a very moist Pork Roast I have ever made & tasted.  
 I shredded the leftover and we had Barbeque Sandwiches the next day meal.
  I just use the juice from roast and add Barbeque sauce and heat them together, It was just about as good as the Roast.

This recipe is good and seems promising, but I only gave it four stars because we liked it better when I made some changes. Most important: I completely omitted the water and doubled the rest of the sauce recipe, so the pork gets more intense flavor from the juice it cooks in. I used brown sugar instead of white sugar and balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar. I used low sodium soy sauce and fresh minced garlic instead of garlic powder. I omitted the salt, but added 1/4 t. ground ginger. In addition to the onion, I added some baby carrots, putting both under the roast in the slow cooker (I've always read that you should put your root veggies under the meat in the crock). With these changes, it was excellent.

I must say this has to be the WORST recipe i have tried from here. The juice in the pot was watery. the roast had no flavour. No ammount of extra seasoning could save this mess.

No penetrated flavors here also.  It was pretty good, but a tad too sweet.  When I make this again, I'll either cut down on the sugar or the ketchup.  It was overkill.  Thanks, though.  It is a very good basic recipe to work with.

Okay, so I was getting nervous as this was cooking... all I could smell was the vinegar. I doubled the sauce ingredients, except for the sugar, used chicken broth in place of the water, added worcestershire sauce, fresh garlic, dried basil and sliced mushrooms (towards the end). I strained the onions to thicken the gravy, and served over buttered egg noodles with green beans and carrots. What a delicious meal! Thank you, K!

Very tasty and the house smelled awesome.  Per other reviews, I used 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup red wine, used brown sugar, used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar and used minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  I also added potatoes and carrots while cooking the roast.  This makes a wonderful gravy and makes a  meal that is so easy to put together.

When I made this, I think I added too much water, because it was more of a broth than a glaze. I rate it a 4 because I made it wrong. My boyfriend loved it however. I accidentally bought tenderloin instead of loin and the meat was moist and tasty.

Wow! I've never made a pork loin that turned out so perfect! (not even my own posted recipe for tenderloin!) I made a few adjustments, based on preference/what I had on hand: reduced sugar to 2T, 1T red wine vinegar + 2T balsamic vinegar, chile sauce instead of ketchup and hot sauce (used 4 pkts from the local Chinese restaurant!), minced garlic (from a jar). I put the roast on top of a Vidalia onion, added 2 celery stalks cut in thirds, and spread the garlic all over the top of the roast. I cooked for 3 hrs on high, did a check with the thermometer (160 deg), turned it down to low for about 3/4 hr (170 deg), turned it off and then let it rest in the pot with the lid off while finishing up everything else. Served with garlic mashed potatoes, steamed carrots and Texas Toast--my husband and guests commented that this was probably better than any pork they've ever had in a restaurant. Yeah!! Even the picky 7-yr-old said it tasted good! Thanks for the recipe :D

Really excellent - BUT - it absolutely does NOT need the cup of hot water. There is more than enough liquid from the roast/onions/sauce. I've made this 4 times since I found it and it comes out perfectly every time without the added liquid.

Was it tangy? Yes. Did the meat fall apart? Definitely. Would I make it again? No. I followed the recipe exactly. The meat was certainly edible, but all we could taste was vinegar and sugar. The sauce was watery and pungent. We slathered barbecue sauce over the meat to make it taste better. With all the positive reviews, I thought it would be better. My bad.

I will look forward to making this but felt compelled to say that adding potatoes to any slow cook recipe robs the dish of it's flavor, mainly the salt.  I will stick with the egg noodles, add a little garlic and let you know how it goes.

Tried this recipe last night - definitely a WINNER in my book !!  Tho...I added slices of fresh lemon, placed slices both underneath as well as arranged on top of the roast (My Dad's suggestion - he's a retired Fireman - all Firemen in Ca. are exceptional cooks !) - used Worcestershire Sauce instead of Soy, only 1/3 cup water and Brown sugar instead of white - served with Teriyaki rice and Veggies - turned out...JUST TO DIE FOR !!  The hint of lemon taste may be the "Tangy" taste you are all looking for !!

very good! I made a few changes based on the reviews and this turned out quite tasty. first, I seasoned the pork loin with garlic powder and pepper and seared it on all sides till nicely browned. Then I added the 1C water to the hot skillet scraping up all the browned bits. I doubled the rest of the seasonings exept for the hot peper sauce, which I used 2t of, and substituted splenda for sugar. I added them to the water from the skillet and poured this over the browned pork loin, and added a bag of baby carrots on top of that. cooked on high for 2 hrs then turned to low for another 3 hrs. Delicious and very tender.

Wow! I made this for our dinner tonight. I started with 2-2lb pork roasts and a large sweet onion, I doubled the sauce ingredients, and let it cook all day. I ended up not using the sauce, because I made some Lipton Onion Soup Roasted potatoes and Sugar Snap Peas and Parisienne Carrots to go with it. The sauce seemed a bit sweet anyway, but the roasts turned out perfectly seasoned (not really tangy, just good flavor)and very moist and tender. I only made one substitution, which was Balsamic Vinegar in place of the Red Wine Vinegar. What a delicious dinner. Even my 10 and 5 year old are happy with it, and my 5 year old son is extremely picky and cautious about what he'll put in his mouth. Great recipe. I noted several others complained it wasn't how they liked their BBQ pork,and I have but one suggestion. Try cooking a pork recipe that actually has BBQ in the name of it. I really liked Barbecued Pork Two Ways, posted by Kimber for a nice crockpot bbq pork recipe. Thanks for the great recipe K!

The kids enjoyed this, even the picky one, but he didn't eat much.  The adults felt it was way too sweet and would've been better to use the pork with a nice BBQ sauce than this too sweet one.  I'd suggest using less sugar.

This was great!  The pork was fall-apart tender after about 7 hours on low.  I played with the sauce ingredients a bit, however.  Instead of ketchup I just used tomato paste, because I had a can of it open that I needed to use up.  I also added Worcestershire because in my experience it makes everything better!  After the pork was cooked I took it out and stirred about a half cup of light roux and a Tbsp of heavy cream into the thin sauce and ended up with a fantastic gravy to spoon over our rice.  Will make again!

This recipe couldn't be easier or tastier! I made it exactly according to the recipe, and it was a snap. The results were tender and flavorful, and the house smelled great from the slow cooker! I'll definitely make this again :)

Received rave reviews. Made these changes: 1) did not add any water at all to the recipe. 2) extra tablespoon or so of soy sauce. 3) added a clove or two of roasted garlic I had on hand. 4) added some extra black pepper and a bit of dried thyme. 5) added a couple of tablespoons of red wine. Cooked on low for 6 hours, turning the meat every 90 mins or so to make sure all got bathed. When finished, I took the sauce and diluted with unsalted chicken broth and thickened with cornstarch until I got a thick sauce that wasn't overpoweringly salty or vinegary, but had a nice flavor. Served with green beans and rosemary roasted potatoes and apple sauce. Cooked a 2 lb roast for four adults and 2 children and we had maybe one ounce of meat leftover. The meat ended up a bit dry because I had to hold it on keep warm for a couple of hours, and then removing the hot meat from the juice to make the gravy seemed to allow the meat to dry out a bit. But the thickened sauce saved it.  What I would change: I might add 1/2 cup or so of the unsalted chicken broth while it was cooking and add a couple of tablespoons of tapioca to thicken while it cooks. Maybe find another herb or two to add to the sauce as the vinegar and sugar just didn't have enough dimension for me, even with the extra garlic.  Will probably make this again, since it was quite easy and trouble-free. Might experiment a little with the seasonings--worcestershire sounds good, maybe some maple syrup for some of the sugar.

I hate when people give 5 stars and then rewrite the recipe, but I'm going to do just that now. :) I'm sure it's good as is, but I knew I'd like some of the changes others had suggested based on my personal preferences. I used a 1.5 lb tenderloin, but still increased the sauce ingredients, so it would be sure to be flavorful and moist: 1.5C water, 1/3C sugar (that was more than enough), 5T balsamic vinegar, 2T worchestire sauce, 1/2t salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Also added carrots and small red potatoes to the mix and cooked on low for just over 5 hours. I was home, so I flipped the loin once during cooking so everything was juicy!

I have cooked pork roasts in the slow cooker for years.  I use coke as the liquid but your recipe is GREAT!!!. For the person who said it was the WORST, don't pay any attention to that.  This was great and will definitely be a keeper.

This is very good. Simple and easy. It could easily be a 4.5 - 5 rating. I added a bit more seasoning salt pepper and garlic (our tastes), browned the pork before putting in the slow cooker. By adding small potatoes and carrots you have a complete meal all in one pot.

I was skeptical of this recipe, but made it anyway since I had some pork and wanted something different.  I am so glad I did!  I doubled the amount of sauce since it didn't look like it was covering the pork very well in my slow cooker.  This was so delicious.  The pork got very tender and soaked up a lot of the flavor.  We had leftovers the next day and it was even better then!  My husband said "make sure you give that one rave reviews from me", so here you go.  Thanks!!

For those who feel the meat was bland, I am wondering if it has anything to do with meat quality or perhaps freezer burn.  I cooked a 3 lb. pork sirloin roast last Sunday and lightly seasoned it with salt, pepper, onion and garlic powders.  It had a bone running through it which I think helps with flavor.  It was so tender I easily pulled it, added some BBQ sauce for sandwiches. It was full of flavor and so tender.  I froze the rest to make pork posole soup and enchiladas. Wish I had seen this recipe last week!

DELICIOUS and easy. It came out great by following the recipe as is. I think it's important that the meat be cut and left to soak in the glorious gravy. I served it with mashed potatoes.

This is a great pork recipe.  I wouldn't call it "tangy" - just tasty and tender!  My family loved it.  Next time I'll sub BBQ sauce for the ketchup.

I have been making this recipe for a couple of years now, and finally am getting around to writing a review.  I was reminded of how great this recipe is this weekend while visiting friends -- I had given her the recipe a while back and it has become a favorite of their family's.  I have tried using balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar, and I have to say I prefer that variety just a little better.  Adding some fresh garlic is good, and I also typically add baby carrots, cut up potatoes and extra onions.  This recipe never fails to garner compliments.

I am kind of shocked by the complaints about this being bland! It is SOOO flavorful!  I double the sauce to start with, include red potatoes and definitely cook it for 8 hours on low.  I do start with a frozen pork loin, and towards the end I used a baster to douse the pork several times. (Not normally needed in a slower cooker, but it "colored" the pork so it wasn't so pale.) I like the thin sauce when I use potatoes and broccoli as sides.  If I use egg noodles and peas, I thicken the sauce with corn starch at the end and it makes an awesome gravy. We love it, and eat this at least once a month.

this is the best pork recipe I've found on this site.  I adjusted as follows - halved recipe for just 2 of us - skipped onion (didn't have fresh and we don't care ALL that much for it), skipped salt altogether - used 1 tsp cayenne pepper instead of hot sauce.  threw in a bit of worchestire sause cause we love that flavor.  dbl'd black pepper.
SO juicy, nice kick without overpowering pork - served with mashed potatoes and green beens, used left overs as pulled pork sandwiches - truly an awesome recipe - will definitely be keeping and using often.

Very tasty! The onions at the bottom were awesome and next time I'll add more.  I added an extra Tablespoon of soy sauce and vinegar.  I too added cornstarch to the juices and boiled down in a pan to make a sauce.  My guests enjoyed it! Thanks!

I used a 1 lb frozen (didn't thaw) pork tenderloin because it's just me & my husband.  If I were to use a 2+ lb roast I would definitely double or even triple the rest of the ingredients so there is plenty of sauce.  I sprinkled the pork with salt, pepper, garlic powder, paprika & poultry seasoning.  I omitted the sugar & just added an additional tbsp of ketchup for sweetness, I also used 5 tbsp of the vinegar as we like things extra tangy.  I also put quite a few dashes of hot sauce because we like it spicy too.  After 4 hours on high I took out the pork & onions then added some flour to the sauce & let it cook to thicken it up a little while the meat rested.  So good, and so healthy (especially without the added sugar)!

Very tasty and easy!  It does come out sweeter than typical pork roast recipes, but I liked it for a change and I did not find it overly sweet.  The liquid is runny, I did try to thicken it up the last 30 minutes with cornstarch and water in the crockpot, but it didn't work too well (maybe I didn't leave it in long enought), next time I will thicken up on the stove instead.  I served it w/ pre packaged mashed potatoes, it was wonderful.  Next time I will add a little more onions, they were great w/ the mashed potatoes.  Will definitely make again.

Whole family was able to enjoy this.  Nice family meal - not too extravagant w/outrageous flavorings that intimidate the kids but something a little bit more than the ordinary meal.  Very simple to prepare (I did 2 hrs on "high" & 4-1/2 hrs on "low") - came out nice & moist.  It's a keeper!

Excellent recipe. I doubled the sauce, adding extra onion, halved red potatoes, a bag of baby carrots, and Lawry seasoning salt. I added all the ingredients in the recipe but also added balsamic vinegar. Had company over and everyone loved it. The pork roast fell apart, it was sooo tender. Will make this often.

Followed the recipe exactly and thought it was delicious.  Removed the roast from the crock pot at the end and added some corn starch to thicken the tangy sauce and then spooned the thickened sauce over the pork to serve.

I made this almost exactly as written, except that I substituted apple cider vinegar for red wine vinegar.  It was fantastic! Apple pairs so nicely with pork anyway, I can't imagine making this any other way.  Next time I may throw some thinly sliced apples in the slow cooker also.  I also drained off the liquid to make a sweet and tangy gravy, which I poured over top of the pork and served alongside mashed potatoes.  A great fall comfort food kind of meal.

After six hours on low, having added cut up red potatoes and carrots to the mix underneath, the pork was fine (if maybe a little dry). My diagnosis, if you add veggie, make sure the pork is still fully immersed in the liquid. There was a definite tangy flavor, but not intense, so don't be afraid to up the seasoning.

Wow!  We've had this recipe twice now and all I can say is YUMMY!!  It makes the most tender roast I've ever had. I make this up and put it on for 8 hours and the meat just shreds underneath a fork.  The only thing different I did was to add carrots and a variety of baby potatoes to the pot for a complete meal. It's really a great recipe to make during this heatwave we've been having since it keeps me from having to turn on my stove/oven.  FANTASTIQUE!

I'm so surprised at all the good reviews because I followed this to a T - my family and I did not enjoy this at all.  I'm disappointed I wasted a beautiful pork roast.  To me it was like a boiled roast in a sweet watery sauce (not even qualified as sauce). It was not really tangy either.  I do like sweet flavors in meals but I guess I usually like them combined with a spicy or savory flavor.  This is not it.   I served as suggested with buttered egg noodles.  BLAH.  Won't make it again.  I'm sorry.

I only gave it 3 stars because I had to change so much. It was a great start and I really like the red wine vinegar. It was just alright as is. I added a lot more seasoning and two tablespoons of dijon mustard. That gave it a really good flavor. Instead of soy ( I was out) I used Worcestershire sauce. I cooked the roast with just one Tablespoon of mustard. Tasted it and decided it still did not have enough flavor. I removed the juices and put them in a pan and added more seasoning and more mustard and a few more dashes of worcestershire sauce. I sprinkled a little roasted dried garlic and onion powder as well. I also used corn starch. It was a good start and will make this again, just using my extras. I also threw in some potatoes and carrots and a onion.

Add 2 bay leaves, One tablespoon worcestershire sauce,and a teaspoon of lawry's/or Old Bay seasoned salt and I think you will find that the flavor will be there at the end. Did I mention two or three cloves of garlic?

Considering the small amount of effort it took to make this dish, it was wonderful.  We added extra onions (because you can never have too many), subbed balsamic vinegar for the red wine vinegar, doubled the sauce and served it with mashed potatoes.  This meal will go into our regular rotation.

Great to make in the summer time because the crock pot doesn't heat up the entire kitchen.  Served it as Latino style carnitas with tortillas, and sides, such as, sauteed corn, Spanish rice, and beans.  Tweaked the recipe by: browning the meat first and adding sliced fresh tomatoes, celery, and other spices, including a bay leaf, fresh garlic, cinnamon stick, and 5-spice powder.  Really a nice, easy meal.

Ho hum...needs more seasonings to be palatable for me. The meat turned out tender, so that is a big plus and means the cooking times are spot on. For next time, I will half the sugar, omit the ketchup and add worchester.

Very yummy!  I decreased the amount of sugar in half and doubled the spices just for personal preference.  With these changes it was very flavorful.  Although next time I won't double the salt.  And I like that it was so easy to prepare.  I had no problem throwing it all together before leaving for work in the morning.

This was a quick and easy recipe for dinner and tasted amazing! I used two medium onions and one red onion for the bottom of the roast. We are a garlic family so I added 5 cloves of garlic to the onion bed.

I doubled up on the red wine vinegar, ketchup, soy sauce and garlic powder, kept all other ingredients the same.  I added red potatoes and carrots as others had suggested.
At the end I removed half of the liquid and combined it with a chicken gravy package.  
Everything was amazing, my family raved!  I will definitely make this again.

This recipe is absolutely phenomenal! The entire family (including 3 kids) loved it!  I doubled the recipe, and never measure spices (just threw in what I thought would be delicious, so probably about twice the garlic recommended)... it was fall-apart, melt-in-your-mouth delicious!!!  Thank you!!

One word: BLAND!  The first time I make a recipe I always for the recipe exactly.  This was no exception.  The finish pork roast had no taste.  The meat was tender and can be saved with the addition of bbq sauce but as written -- not so good.

This recipe was pretty good.  I was out of red wine vinegar, so I substituted with 2 tbsp balsamic vinegar and 2 tbsp marsala wine.  I also used 2-3 tbsp cornstarch because I prefer a thicker sauce, and I thought it turned out really nice.  Also made noodles as a side that were great with a little of the sauce on them.  All in all, I would make this recipe again.

The sauce you pour over the pork is mostly water. It didn't even stick to the pork. So then it came out dry with barely any flavor. Never making this again.

This is a great basic recipe that can easily be modified to suit individual tastes.  I added crushed fresh garlic, extra garlic powder, and a little Chinese five spice powder.  I used balsamic vinegar and a little extra soy sauce, and cayenne instead of the hot sauce.  I coarsely chopped the onion and put half in the bottom of the pot and half on top.  I seared the roast first in a cast iron skillet, then left it on low all day.  Really good!

This is a keeper! I marinated the roast overnight in the sauce and added carrots and potatoes to the bottom of my crock pot. The roast turned out a bit dry, but I think it was my issue with overcooking. We'll definitely use this again - thanks for the recipe.

Considering the ease of preperation/cooking, this recipe is great!  I greatly reduced the sugar (just added a couple table spoons of brown sugar) and increased everything else at the suggestion of so many before me (also added Worstechire sauce and several cloves of garlic).  I added potatoes, onions, and carrots to the bottom of the slow cooker for a more complete meal.  Pork lets go of a lot of moisture when it cooks, and since I followed the tip to double the sauce, I ended up having to remove some of the liquid to keep it from overflowing.  That's ok though, I added some cornstarch to it and made a nice gravy to poor over everything.  Tasty!

Sorry, but this tasted nothing like roast pork, which was what I really wanted. I made the recipe as stated, and was quite disappointed. I'll not be making again. 3 stars for simple, though!

Excellent recipe!! The only tip I'd give would be to add a little cornstarch to the sauce (after the meat is cooked) to make a little thicker gravy. Friends of ours did that, and it tasted awesome!

I browned the roast first, added about 2 T of minced garlic and thickened the sauce with cornstarch. My family went crazy over this roast! It sure didn't serve 8, though. There were only 4 of us and everyone still wanted more when the roast was gone!

This was great!
Of Course I couldn't just follow the recipe... But the end result was terrific! I used a very large onion, cut into rings. About a third of the onion I minced and did like-wise with a green pepper... After browning the roast I sautéed the minced onion and green pepper (which I then poured on top of the roast) A little soy sauce goes along way, so I only added 1 Tablespoon, not 2. I added 1 Tbl of red wine vinegar and added 3/4 cup of water and juice from 1/2 lime. I added 2 extra Tablespoons of ketchup and pierce the roast and planted 4 garlic cloves worth of chopped garlic. I pulled the roast out at 165 degrees and let it rest (covered) for 15 min in warm oven... the juice made great gravy!   This is a new staple in the Widmark household.  Thank you, K

Tangy and yummy! I left out the sugar - saw no reason to add that. I doubled all the other ingredients, which left enough juice to make a gravy by adding some cornstarch mixed with water. I also added baby carrots into the pot at the very beginning so they were tangy and flavorful as well. I served the gravy over mashed potatoes. Delicious! Will definitely make this again!

Flavor-wise, this was a good recipe, but if I make it again, I will use a pork shoulder roast instead of a loin. My pork was somewhat dry and that disappointed me, as I was really looking forward to this dish. I am willing to try it again, though, but just with a cheaper cut of pork.

Oh my goodness, SO good!!! I lessened the amount of red wine vinegar, omitted sugar, and rubbed down the meat with additional garlic powder. I also omitted the hot pepper sauce, added some Worcestershire sauce, and teriyaki sauce. I know, very different, but we like our sauces. This was DELICIOUS and we will be making it again!!

I have made multiple meals from recipes from this site and this is by far one of my top 5! I made a few changes...

I doubled the recipe. I used a 4lb loin. I generously seasoned the meat with salt, pepper and garlic salt. I added red skin potatoes to the bottom of the crockpot (instead of onions). After placing the meat in the crockpot I added some baby carrots. 

Overall this was EXCELLENT. I cooked it on low for 9 hours while I was at work. It feel apart in my mouth. 

5 stars!

I thought this was very good.  I followed the recipe except that I used Balsamic Vineager.  I did not feel that it was lacking in flavor or spice.  The sauce was excellent on potatoes.  I would recommend this to anyone.  All the family liked it and I also thought that the flavors blended the second day with leftovers.

I love this dish. It is pretty simple to make. I added fresh garlic cloves and minced onions to enhance the taste a bit. I also did about 3 dashes of hot pepper sauce instead of the 1. Instead of sugar I substituted Splenda.

The next day I used the leftover pork and pulled it, topped it off with some barbecue sauce, and reheated it to make pulled pork bbq sandwiches and it was still delicious.

I have made this twice. It is good using the original recipe. The second time I did use 1/4 cup soy sauce, 1 teaspoon sesame oil, and 1 teaspoon garlic powder just to add a little more flavor. I served it over rice, but next time I will add flour to thicken up the juices.

Made exactly per the above recipe except for the hot sauce!  It was wonderful!  Flavorful, juicy...and so super easy in the slow cooker!  It will become a staple for our winter meals!

Loved this!!!  I only changed a couple things... I put onions and potatoes along the bottom and then I substituted balsamic vinegar for the red wine vinegar and double all of the spices except for the ketchup and the sugar.   I also browned the roast first with garlic powder, thyme, and garlic salt and it was delicious!  I wanted a different taste than my normal beef roast and this was perfect.  Also the potatoes soaked up all that wonderful flavor and were amazing!  Could not stop eating!

Why do people give a wonderful recipe less stars than it deserves due to THEIR deviation of the recipe???  Read the rating below mine and you will see why I'm annoyed.   This recipe is WONDERFUL!  I put mine in my pressure cooker for one hour and it was melt-in-your-mouth GOOD!  If you use your pressure cooker allow it to cool by itself when it's done.

OH MY GOD. This recipe is awesome! The only thing I changed was to brown the roast first and cut the sugar in half (we don't like very sweet food). SOOOO GOOD!!!

MmMMMMMMMmmmmMMM! I followed the recipe to a T- except 2 things. I changed the sugar to brown sugar.....and for the 'hot spice'  I did a few dashes of cayenne, and a dash of Red Chili flakes. This had such a wonderful taste! I was planning a dinner party so I had to cook on High in the slow cooker for 4 hours. The meat was PERFECT! I basted throughout. I also added potatoes and baby carrots in the mix, under the meat. Soooo yummy. When it was all done, I separated the juice and simmered it on the stove-adding about 3-4 Tablespoons cornstarch and some Half & Half to thicken into a gravy-like consistency. then it all went back to the Veggies and meat-which I thinly sliced and served over egg noodles. Next time, Ill skip the noodles, it was too much on the plate and not necessary.

This recipe was delicious! I took the advice of many posters before and tripled the sauce ingredients (except the sugar and the water), used fresh minced garlic instead of powder, browned the roast, and pierced it with a fork to allow the juices to penetrate.  I also brined the roast before I put it in the crock pot (3 lb roast-2 quarts water, 1/4 cup sugar, 1/4 cup salt, leave it to soak for 1 1/2 hours), which may have prevented the dryness others complained about. I made this late in the day, so I had to put it on high for 3 1/2 hours instead of on low for longer like I normally would. It still turned out very juicy and flavorful, but next time I'm going to try marinading it overnight as others have suggested and cooking it on low all day. I plan on turning the leftovers into shredded pork tacos. I will definitely make this again, with buttered acorn squash and sauteed zucchini on the side!

Very good and easy!  Doubled sauce ingred and used chicken stock not water.  Great flavor, so tender just falls apart.  Next time will add cornstarch at the end so sauce is thicker and carrots and potatoes.  Tonight is leftovers shredded in BBQ sauce for dinner

I made this recipe, exactly as written, overnight on a weeknight.  We loved it - very aromatic.  I doubled all the ingredients (except the pork), as suggested by some reviewers.  The best part about this recipe is how tender the pork is.  I reheated everything when we got home from work that night and served it with boiled red potatoes and fresh string beans - pouring the sauce over the vegetables.  This will become a regular item on our menu!

Okay...I hate to change recipes, because that would mean a totally different recipe.  However, the only thing different I did was marinate a 5lb pork roast (bone in) in Italian Dressing (and a little soy sauce) overnight.  Followed the recipe exactly the next day and it was AWESOME.  Very moist and my kids loved it! Will make again!  Thank you!

My husband and son liked this. Based on some other reviews I substituted chicken broth for the hot water, 2 tbl. Worstershire sauce and 1 tbl.Terriyaki sauce for the soy sauce, left out the sugar, and used 3 tbl. ketchup and added more garlic powder (my guys like garlic!). I used a pork sirloin roast. It was yummy, subtle flavors, not overpowering. I served it with oven roasted potatoes. A real keeper.

This was fabulous. I browned the meat first and I made it for 4, added chinese chili sauce, worcestershire sauce and mixed the water with herb ox beef broth. Cut the sugar to 1 teaspoon. I chopped the onions and added 4 chopped garlic cloves. I thickened the sauce with cornstarch at the end. Really good.

I found that this dish still had a kick even without the hot sauce.  I served this for my mother-in-law, who doesn't like anything spicy, unusual or ethnic.  The dish had a mildlly spicy aftertaste but it seemed to be enough for even my MIL to handle.  She enjoyed the dish very much and cleared her plate, as did everyone else at the table.  Besides excluding the hot sauce, the other changes I made were to use 3/4 of a large onion instead of a whole onion (all I had) and balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar (that's all I had; not sure if perhaps that's what gave it a little kick?).  I also followed the suggestions of others and doubled everything, except for the pork roast and the onion.  I also added about six carrots, cut in large pieces.  The carrots were awesome  with this dish, as they soaked up all of the flavor.  My roast was 1 3/4 lb and I cooked it on low for four hours, then kept it warm for several hours after that.  The carrots were perfect.  They were tender but not mushy.  I also made gravy out of the drippings and served the whole thing over egg noodles as suggested.  I'll definitely be serving this again!

UPDATE
As promised, I made this again.  This time I used two pork loins, one whole onion, two bags of carrots and the other ingredients as recommended.  I cooked it on low for eight hours.  I don't think  you can really go wrong with this recipe, however eight hours was too much for the pork.  It was a little dried out.  Also, there were almost no dri

I put this all together in a plastic storage bag and marinated it overnight before I put it in the crock pot yesterday morning.  I used apple cider vinegar and brown sugar as well as Tamari soy sauce.  Tasty and very tender.  The meat just fell apart.  We served it with garlic mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. A very hearty dinner. I highly recommend the Tamari soy sauce because other regular store brands have very little actual flavor; they are just salty.  The Tamari costs more, but it tastes wonderful!

All I can say is WOW!!! We all enjoyed this meat sooo much.  I followed a couple of former posters and used BBQ sauce,Spenda and since I had a 41/2 lb pork roast (w/bone) I doubled the sauce recipe. After about 61/2 hrs., I removed the meat and thickened the gravy with cornstearch.  I wish I could've given this recipe 10 stars.  Thanks for posting.

OMG, this is to die for.  I used 2 yellow onions, (will do 3 next time) and the onion carmelized on the bottom. Yum!  I added 1/2 tsp Worchestershire sauce and 1/4 tsp dry mustard, but kept the rest of the ingredients as listed.  The flavor was out of this world and the meat (bone in, on-sale, pork roast) turned out fork tender.  Everyone loved it.

Would definitely serve to meat-eating guests.
My only substitution was brown sugar for the white.  Thanks, K!

LOVED IT - VERY TASTEY!! - and we are not big pork fans.  This pork roast melts in your mouth, moist with a great flavor.  Altered the ingredents some, used brown sugar and only 1/2 amount called for, used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine cutting it back to 2 TBSP, 1/4 tsp red pepper in place of black, used fresh garlic and replaced hot pepper sauce with 2 TBSP chilli sauce.  I also used Italian shallots for my onions and threw in some carrots.  Thickened the sauce to a gravy consistancy which give the whole meal that mmm, mmm, good flavor!! Cooked it on low for 7 hours...perfect!!  Will definetly make it again!

I never cook a recipe as it's written, and I did this one. Very tasty, if I were to make a change, I would double on everything in the "juice" except the water. However, cooked as written, I used the "juice" after the roast was done, added another cup of water and thickened with cornstarch. Served the roast and sauce over ginger and soy seasoned Basmati rice...AMAZING!

Even doubling the spice mixture after reading previews reviews didn't do the trick for this recipe.  If we try it again, we'll use a fattier piece of meat to add to the flavor.  Advice for this one would be to make sure to puncture the meat thoroughly so that the liquid can help tenderize the meat.  At 6hrs the meat was still tough, so I cut it into smaller pieces and turned it on high for another hour.  This did help some.

I've made this several times and my husband raves. I follow another reviewer's suggestion to stab the roast repeatedly with a fork on all sides so that the flavors seep in. Otherwise I follow the recipe exactly and it comes out great!

Good recipe, but after reading the reviews, I cut back on the sugar and the water and was glad I did. Also put the onions on a bed of potatoes before adding the meat.

Seen some negative reviews but gave it a try.  This meal was great, easy to make and the kids even asked for seconds....this rarely happens!  I will make again and keep the ingredients without changing the recipe.  Thanks.

I added a lot more garlic and pepper and the pork was still a little bland for our tastes.  I shredded it up and made it into sandwiches with extra hot sauce and diced onions.  Not bad, but I'll definitely make more adjustments if I make this again.

This was great!  THe gravy was amazing!  I made a few changes because of what I had on hand and what my family likes:  I used chopped frozen onions and white wine vinegar.  I did not use any hot sauce.  I cooked the meat on low for 5 hours and it came out great ( I have a 6qt. crock and it cooks pretty fast)!  My roast was about 3 lbs.  I also added wondra to the gravy to thicken it up after I took the meat out and strained the juice.  Great tasting gravy to top the mashed potatoes I served it with.

One of my favorite meals.  I usually shred the pork roast, and add about 1 Tbsp of cornstarch to thicken the sauce before serving over noodles.  Also really good with chicken.

I added more soy sauce and ketchup.  I only added about 1tbps of sugar.  Instead of a regular onion, I used a sweet onion and I added chopped up carrots into the crockpot as well.  I did brown the meat before putting it in the crockpot.

Very disappointed in this recipe. I made it exactly as directed as far as the sauce mixture, but I used a 3 lb boneless pork rib roast (which I believe is slightly fattier than a regular loin roast).  I cooked it on low for about 7 hours and came home to a dried out piece of meat.  We threw most of it out as it wasn't even very flavourful.  It did smell really good though...I wonder if doubling the sauce and perhaps marinating the roast overnight might help with the flavour and texture.  If I find pork roast on sale for really cheap I may try this again (and marinate overnight); otherwise, unfortunately, this one is going into my "never again" file.

Oh Yum Yum Yum! Bonus Points: my kids loved it too! I'm not an onion eating person but I ate some and then, what was left over! YUM! 
I followed some advise from another Cook, used thickly cut potatoes on the bottom then Sweet Yellow Onion cut same as potatoes. Browned my Pork Loin and cut it into Large Chunks placed on the Onion. Adding Baby carrots where ever there was room around the pork loin. I would even say after you poured the liquid on the Pork Loin..add another layer of baby carrots.. I think it will work.
My prep time was still very minimal, and I don't like big productions! And sooo yummy well work the "ha ha" work. All my teen girls added it to their own recipe collections. ;o)

The meat was very tender, but too sweet and not nearly "tangy" enough to have that word included in the recipe's title.

I used a dutch oven and cooked this on the stovetop in 2 hours.   I also took the advice of a few by substituting brown sugar for white, and I added a spoonful of tomato paste to the mixture.  After 1 1/2 hours, I cut the roast into thick slices so the liquid would cover all the meat while it finished cooking.  It turned out great!  Very moist and flavorful.  I thickened the liquid with a little cornstarch and added mushrooms to make gravy, which everyone enjoyed.  This recipe is a keeper!

My husband and children LOVED this recipe. I prepared it as directed and was concerned there wouldn't be enough sauce. But there was. My husband couldn't wait for me to prepare it with the noodles and simply shredded it and mixed it in with the sauce for a pulled pork sandwich. The only leftovers remaining have been set aside by my husband for his lunch tomorrow. Thanks for the recipe! I'll definitely be making this again.

This recipe was great, and very easy.  I had all of the ingredients in the house already, so just buying the pork roast was great!  Gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because I would have liked the sauce to be a little thicker, but that can easily be accomplished with flour, per other reviews.  I will definitely make again!!

I'll definitely make this again.  The sauce tasted great; I used cornstarch to thicken.  I served over egg noodles as suggesgted.  I used a 1 3/4 lb pork loin and added a bag of baby carrots.  I doubled all the sauce ingredients but used only 1 cup of water.  If I didn't have carrots, I wouldn't have used any water.

Yum!! It was so good. Just a couple suggestions...trim any excess fat before cooking and cut meat into large cubes for quicker cooking.

My family loves this recipe.  It is my go-to slow cooker dinner.  I often double the sauce because my family likes it served over mashed potatoes.  I take the roast out of the slow cooker and slice.  I will then thicken the sauce with a little cornstarch and water to make a gravy.  Delicious!!

We had mixed reviews on this one.  I felt it was too sweet but my son and husband liked it.  I followed the recipe then, after it was done, made a creamy gravy by making a roux, incorporating the juices from the crockpot until thickened then mixing in about a cup of sour cream.  I also added some salt and worcestershire sauce (trying to cut back the sweetness) - then we ate it with the gravy, meat and some egg noodles all together (like a stroganoff). If you like sweet pork - you will like this recipe!

I thought it was a very tasty meal. Very easy i just added some red potatoes and chunked them up, I also added fresh baby carrots. The next time I make it I will use less sugar and double up on the spices for a little more flavor.

This was pretty good- better than I thought it would be.  I was afraid it was going to be dry because I had to leave it on low for well over 8 hours due to my work schedule.  But it wasn't bad.  Since its just me and my husband we had quite a bit leftover so I shredded the meat to use in quesadillas the next night.  Yum!

This was delcious. I read some of the reviews about the water watering the sauce down so I only added half the water and upped the amount of everything else. I used this with ribs. This was flavorful and moist and tender.

I make alot of crock-pot recipes, and this surpassed them all! It was super juicey and the flavor was rediculous. A few changes I made: I added a package of mushrooms and some cubed red potatoes. I also added a package of Lipton dry muchroom and onion soup mix and a cup of marsala wine. I also took out 1/4 - 1/2 of the sauce/broth at the end of the cooking process and reduced it over the stove by half ( it made an amazing gravy!!). Highly recommended!

The meat does come out extremely tender, but i really found the taste to be lacking. Seems to me it needs more seasoning...just something was missing and i'm not sure of what. It's good just to get the meat so tender, i'm going to use the left overs as filling for pork enchiladas.

The meal was dynamic! I did add potatoes (small reds and sweet potatoes with carrots along with the onion).  For the leftovers I pulled the remaining pork and thickened the juice to a gravy, added everything in one pot. FABULOUS!!

Made this in crockpot yesterday - and it is fabulous.  I did use some of the suggestions and used brown sugar instead of white, cayenne and crushed red pepper flakes instead of hot sauce and added celery.  A couple hours into 7 hour cook time I added potatoes and carrots.  We like spicy food and it had just the right kick.  Not sure why some of the people say it's bland - mine was extremely flavorful.  Definitely a keeper at our house.

This was delicious!  I did make it a little differently.  I forgot the sugar so I added a couple of tablespoons to the sauce after it was already in the slow cooker.  Also, in lieu of the additional spices, I added a package of dry Italian salad dressing mix.  Followed others advise and added some baby carrots as well.  Those carrots were like candy, addicting!  So good.  Thanks for sharing this yummy recipe.

I made this recipe Exactly the way it was written except I added about a tablespoon of fresh minced garlic.  I also didn't have red wine vinegar so I used distilled white vinegar.  The meat came out WONDERFUL!  I even cooked buttered egg noodles and sugar snap peas to go with it.  My husband, who is a wonderful cool, LOVED the meal. And my kids ate 2nds and 3rds!  My only suggestion is when maybe make the liquid part of the recipe increase it so there is enough to drizzle over the noodles.  They all wanted more sauce.  Amazing!

Disappointed. Pork was dry and sauce was too sweet. Husband and I disliked the recipe. I gave the leftovers for my sister to try since she wanted the recipe. No word on the taste test. I will not make it again.

Loved this!  It's sort of oriental in flavour, which went down well in this house.  Only change I made was to use brown sugar instead of white.  I served this with mashed potato and steamed bokchoi and it was really good.  Used the left over bokchoi, roast and some of the gravy with more veg and chow mein noodles to make a stir fry.  There were compliments on both meals!

This was fantastic! I've only made pork roast once before and it was terrible.  I decided to try once more and I was not disappointed this time around.  I stuffed the roast with garlic and rubbed it with salt & pepper, then browned it all over before putting it in the slow cooker.  Even my picky two-year-old loved it!  This one's going in my recipe box.

This is so good! My house smelled wonderful when I came home and I just HAD to try a bit before SO got home. It's so tastey! I can't wait for dinner. lol I followed the recipe pretty closely, except that I left out the onions (don't like them), doubled the sauce (very generous with everything) and took it easy on the sugar when I doubled the recipe. I'll be making this again, for sure!

This is the best slow cooker pork recipe I have made. I did do one thing different. I browned the pork roast in a heavy cast iron skillet before adding it to the crock pot. I do this with all my meats.Ann

I love this recipe.  I have followed it pretty much exactly every time I make it.  I add all the ingredients and anything else that sounds good to me that I have on hand.  I like to add potatoes and onions to the bottom and serve them along side this roast.  I would recommend cooking it the full 8 hours.  It gets so tender and moist and just falls apart!!

This was the best slow cooker pork recipe I've ever tasted--possibly the best pork "roast" recipe too! I used a large pork tenderloin I had in my freezer.  I added the potatoes and carrots as other reviewers recommended and also salted/peppered the loin and seared it before putting it in.  Otherwise I followed the recipe as is, and it didn't need any other tweaking.  I served it on top of a tomato lentil couscous boxed mix, which soaked up the juice nicely. My husband and I both cleared our plates completely, and he even commented that it didn't need salt or anything added! I may never use another pork slow cooker recipe besides this one again...

The fam loved it!! i used a boston butt roast instead of a loin roast and it came out falling apart tender. the flavor was fabulous. I doubled the sauce recipe, to make sure to cover the roast in the crock pot.   I also used balsamic vinegar in place of redwine vinegar. this will become a regular at my house!    i've used this sauce on short ribs as well.. very very good!!

Outstanding recipe!  I did as other suggested and added new potatoes, more onion and carrots.  I did find that it took about nine hours (on an 8-hour setting in my slow cooker) to get the potatoes and carrots tender.  I also added an extra tbsp of soy sauce (low sodium) and used a couple dashes of cayenne pepper, because I was out of hot sauce.  One of the best recipes yet!

I love, love, love this recipe!!  My family and friends request this all the time.  I only change it by using chicken stock instead of water.  I cook in the slow cooker on high all day.  I serve it as a Mexican pulled-pork Torta.  Big kaiser buns, slathered with mayo, piled high with this pork, jared jalapeno slices and avacado slices make this a huge hit!!  Thank you!!

When my husband first tasted this, all he could say was "WOW, I could eat this all week". Right away he asked for a second sandwich.

 Now I normally do not like to read reviews about a recipe that people have changed in a million different ways, but I HAD to do two small things differently. 

 1st. I didn't have any red wine vinegar, but I did have red wine and white vinegar so I used a bit of both.

 2nd. I was already using my slow cooker for another dish, so I cooked this recipe covered, in my oven at 350 degrees for about 3 hours, (or untill tender)with the sauce. 

 It turned out great! I'm sure I will be making this again!

This roast came out so tender and delicious! I cooked it for 9 hours and also added some chicken broth. I served it with mashed potatoes, and thickened the sauce with cornstarch, but the gravy was a little too tangy for our liking. I also served it with sweet corn cake from this site (which I highly recommend!) I will DEFINATELY make this roast again! Thanks!

This is a good easy weeknight dinner recipe that my husband really liked. It's not as tangy as the recipe might lead you to believe - it is almost plain. I'm going to shred the leftovers and add some cumin and chili powder for shredded pork tacos - versatile leftovers!

Normally I am not a big sweet/sour pork fan but this was surprisingly good! We made this with 1 can of vegetable broth instead of the hot water, doubled the sugar and tripled the rest of the ingredients. Thanks for the post!

I've made this twice and loved it.  I doubled the liquids and instead of hot water used beef broth.  I used a couple cloves of minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  Next time I will add some minced gingerroot.  I took the juices and added some cornstarch/wine mixture and it made a wonderful gravy.  This recipe is a keeper!

This was an excellent recipe. I used a smaller roast so naturally I reduced the cooking time. Because my family loves fresh mushrooms, I added them during the last 20-30 minutes. I added a little bit of red wine, soy sauce and then lightly sprinkled some additional white sugar on top of the roast and mushrooms to flavor them. It was perfect. My family loved it.

This was really good! The only thing I did different was to remove the roast and chill the whole pot outside for about 30 minutes. In my weather it got really cold, really quick, and hardened all of that fat, making it really easy to spoon it off. While it was chilling, I finished preparing dinner. Then I brought the juice to simmer in a large saucepan and thickened it with a cornstarch & broth mixture. It made a wonderful gravy to serve on top of rice along with a crispy salad. I will make it again, maybe adding some vegetables near the end of the cooking time. Yum!

Made it exactly as the recipe said but doubled it. Everyone from 4 year olds to adults loved it. Served it in toasted Panini bread, with the sauce that I separated the fat out of first.

would have given a 4-1/2 if available.  This was very good.  Different kind of gravy because of the sweetness.  But my husband and I really enjoyed it.
I browned the roast in skillet w/olive oil before putting into slow cooker.

If I hadn't change this alittle I would have given this 5 stars!  This is the best recipe I've gotten from this site.  What I did differently was I doubled the dry spices and decreased the ketchup & sugar a bit.  This was awesome and very very easy!! 

6/26/2018 I added a poultry seasoning (fresh sage, thyme & rosemary) and my family loved it!

This turned out really good.  I decided to double the sauce and sub brown sugar for white and then I realized my red wine vinegar was looking really off so I had to make a last minute adjustment - so I used red wine and white vinegar.  I was a little nervous because of the vinegar smell when it was cooking but it turned out really great.  The meat had a nice sweetness to it and we really enjoyed it.  Next time I think I will throw some veggies in the slow cooker with it.

I followed this recipe exactly. My family loved it. Pork is a favorite of yours and I thought that the ingredients didn't take away or cover up the flavor of the pork. My kids thought it was a little 'hot' so I will cut back on the black pepper next time. Trust me, there will be a next time.

This was delicious and easy.  I took  the advice of reviewers and cut the water in half and used half again as much spices as called for, otherwise I made it exactly as written and the flavor was really good.

I did not really like this flavor very much. The pork was indeed very tender, but I thought it was too sweet and too.. well, tangy. I also didn't like the flavor of the steamed/boiled/slow cooked onions. If I was ever to do this again (unlikely), I would brown the outside of the pork first for more flavor and perhaps saute the onions beforehand as well. Onion flavor was too strong.

This was an awesome easy recipe!  The roast taste even better the next day!   I prepared just as shown with one small addition of some chopped garlic ( kind that comes in the little jar ) instead of the garlic powder.  Best thing was I had all the ingredients in my pantry already too!

I followed this recipe. My slow cooker is a bit large. In hindsight, I should have upped the seasoning and liquid a little, but that being said, the meat was pretty bland.  It was soft in that it fell apart, but it wasn't tangy by any stretch. The used red onions, but the onions really didn't do anything for me, I didn't think it was the best flavor for the meat. I enjoyed making it, slow cooker recipes are always cool, but this one didn't work out for me.

easy and tasty. Our pork roast was 3 1/2 lbs so I figured for a little longer cooking time. Plus I added potatoes, carrots, and celery (in addition to the onion). As a result, I did not taste the hot sauce that gives the dish its name. So next time I'll add more hot sauce, maybe 1/2 tsp or so. And I think I'll pull back on the sugar. All that to say, It's an easy recipe to tweak to your personal preferences.

Second time, I used pork loin chops and doubled the sauce. Fortunately I stopped the cooking at 4hours (instead of 6 per recipe) because with the chops, it needs less time. Even so, at 4 hours, it seemed a little dry to me. That was my doing, not the fault of the recipe. NOTE TO SELF: with chops, cook about 3 or 3 1/2 hrs.

Like others suggested, put large red potato chunks under the onion. After cooking for several hours, added a can of Butter Beans to the crockpot. Will definitely add 2 cans next time!

Great alternative to the standard "cream of mushroom soup" crock pot roast,  I used  a pork loin roast and the meat was very moist and mildly flavored.  I did double the spices and add in about 1 tsp of liquid smoke.  This would make excellent roast pork sandwiches.

Whew!  Salty!  Definitely do not need to add the additional 1/2 tsp salt, the saltiness from soy sauce is plenty, especially if you salt and pepper the pork before placing it into the pot.  Otherwise a very tasty recipe.  I used pork steak instead of pork loin as I find pork loin to be quite dry, even in the crockpot.

I made this the other day for my small family of 3 and it was almost all gone but one serving so my daughter took it to work and her co worker ate and asked me for the recipe on facebook.  YUMMY! I added carrots to it on top of the onions and right before the roast was done I added potatoes.  I then took some of the juice in the slow cooker and made gravy to pour over it.

The first time I made this I only had cider vinegar so I used that (it's a natural with pork anyway) my family raved about it, I'm not sure what people mean by it has no flavor, between the soy, the vinegar and the sugar it's a great balance.  We just shred it up and serve it on rolls, the juice it makes is so delicious!

I made this using the exact recipe, cooking it on low and it was very good. Next time I will reduce the cooking time by an hour because my crock pot runs a little hot and the meat was a little dry. Next time I will ask the butcher for some extra fat!  There were leftovers so I shredded (or pulled) the pork and heated it up along with all the juices from the crock pot and slow simmered it all, the juices, onions and the meat, in about a cup of barbeque sauce on the stove top. This recipe lent itself well to using whatever may be leftover to making pulled pork barbeque sandwiches because the base flavors were already in place. So I got what I call a 2fer- 2 meals for one!

The meat fell apart when I cut it it was delicious!!!  I used balsamic vinegar, I didn't have red wine vinegar which gave it a tangier flavour.  I also marinaded it overnight in the crockpot and poked a lot of holes with a fork.  My family loved it all.  I used the leftovers to make pulled apart pork.  In a pan used 1 cup of bbq sauce half cup of beef broth and a tbsp of brown sugar let it simmer for and hour and put them on toasted buns.  They were asking when I was going to make it again it was so good.

This was a good recipe, I just couldn't give it 5 stars as it did not wow me.  My husband liked it and I enjoyed it also.  Next time I will try to increase the spices and also not let the meat cook so long.  I let it sit in there too long and the meat became too tender for my tastes.  I did add red potatoes to the bottom and they turned out great!!  Next time will try with carrots!

Not a fan of this recipe and I usually like most anything that rates 4 or higher in stars.  Prepared as written and although pork was tender, I found it to be bland with lots of liquid that I had to thicken with cornstarch before serving.  I also tried this recipe again making similar adjustments from other reviewers such as using brown sugar instead of white, using Worcestershire instead of soy sauce and using tomato sauce instead of ketchup. The amended product was a very slight improvement over the "as written" recipe.  Unfortunately, not a big enough improvement to try a third time!

Made this for the inlaws and it came out fantastic.  Super tender.  After reading the seasoning reviews, I did use a little less sugar and used about 3/4 tsp minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  I seasoned the meat thoroughly with coarse black pepper and kosher salt, and then seared in olive oil before putting in the crock pot which I think made a big difference.

This recipe is a keeper! Super simple to put together and very flavorful.  I found that basting the pork roast helped to keep it moist.  I also like to serve this over rice and 2x as much onion because we enjoy the sweet onion with the pork roast.

My modifications, because what is an allrecipes review without them, lol: I don't use the sugar, I season the meat with salt and pepper instead of adding it to the liquid, and I add a bit more garlic powder and hot sauce than the recipe demands. The first time we ate it, I thought it could use more seasoning but my husband insisted that it was perfect the way it was, so I haven't added anything else.

My family loved this!  I usually have a few suggestions to make, but I can't think of a anything that needs changing in this recipe.   Maybe if I didn't have small kids I would add a lot more hot pepper sauce!  :)  I will make this again.

Fantastic!  I added red potatoes and baby carrots.  We loved this.  I made Buttery Rolls to go along with it and the meal was a hit with hubby, mom, MIL, and my 3 yr old.  Can't beat that!

The pork was so tender and flavorfill.  I used a larger roast and cooked it for 9 hours.  It was so good, the best ever.

Best slow cooker Pork recipe.  We frequently cook pork in our slow cooker (bbq pulled pork, etc).  This is the one we always go back to, it's always a big hit with family and guests.  We just stick in in the slow cooker frozen with ingredients and put on low heat for 6-8 hours.

Pretty good but lacking in the spice department. I added some thyme to the mixture and put some atop the roast itself too...came out tasty.

This was very good.  I cooked four chops, bone in since I didn't have a roast on hand.  I also made a little extra gravy to make sure everything was covered in the crock pot.  My husband really liked this!  Served it with buttered and garlic egg noodles and some veggies.

Very good recipe but a little too sweet for out taste even after reducing sugar in half.  This recipe is definitely worth  making again but will omit sugar totally.  I also subbed 4-6 cloves fresh garlic for garlic powder (real garlic much better tasting and offers immune health benefits).  Thanks for sharing

Wow!  Subtle flavors but still so good!  After reading the reviews I was so boggled out how everyone did this or that different that I decided to stick with the recipe to a T for my first time making it.  I loved it and glad I tried it this way and now can't wait to make again with others suggestions!  Thanks for a great slow cooker recipe!

Love this recipe. I have made it often. I do not the add sugar and I use apple cider vinegar. I load the bottom of the pan with at leat 3 onions cut in slices. The cooked onions are wonderful with the pulled pork.  Thanks for the recipe.

Fantastic roast!! In my haste, I thought every household had a bottle of soy sauce in its pantry. I was wrong! I used worcestershire sauce instead. I omitted the hot sauce, and it did okay! No complaints around the table. Will make again! Thanks so much!!

I followed the recipe adding the carrots and potatoes as some people suggested, but wouldn't add the potatoes next time. The onions and carrots were very good, but too much of the same flavor.  I also applied a layer of whole grain dejon mustard on top of the pork after an hour of cooking as I thought the sauce was too sweet, added a nice flavor.  Also, made a gravy using the leftover sauce as one person suggested; first used flour and butter for a thickener then boiled down the sauce and lastly added sour cream...delicious on top of the noodles and pork. I cooked the noodles in addition in case we didn't like the potatoes which we didn't so this was a good idea. Also made the sugar snap peas...a good balance for the meal. Will make again...!  Good cold night meal!

The meat was very tender, but with the measurements listed, my pork loin wasn't as flavorful as I was expecting. It was still good, I just need to add my own sauce for a little more flavor.

This was a great recipe! I used brown sugar instead like some others, but didn't have the red wine vinegar so used balsamic instead. I love pepper but if you don't you might want to cut it in half.  I also cooked it with cubed sweet potatoes & found that to be a great dea.  poured off the liquid & thickened it with corn starch but not necessary to do so. Will make again & am looking forward to leftovers!

No stars.  The roast was so dry. I made this recipe straight up no-mods and did it on low.  Besides being dry it had no flavor. The drippings were even useless for a gravy.

Added carrots and red potatoes so I could have a one-pot meal.  Cut sugar back to about 2 teaspoons, will probably try brown sugar or maybe honey next time.  Grated about a tablespoon of fresh ginger into liquids.  Browned pork in a pan, and cut slits in it to slide in some garlic cloves.

I make this all of the time for company and they always love it.  I do add minced garlic and always sear the tenderloin before putting it in the crock pot for appearance sake.  Also, I add a little balsamic vinegar.  Turns out great every time!

This was pretty good.  Not a real strong flavor, but it was flavorful and the meat was very moist.  I did cut back a little on the sugar a little.  Everyone liked it.

We enjoyed this roast a lot! I made it exactly as written and about 1-1/2 hours before it was done I added in a bag of drained and rinsed sauerkraut, which soaked in all the juices and tasted wonderful w/ the pork. I cooked mine for 8 hours, but next time I think I'll go less, maybe 7 because it was just a tinge dry. The house smelled amazing while it was cooking and we thought it had great flavor and was nice and tender. I will be making this again! Thanks for posting. :)

Made this yesterday and it was really good. Gave it 4 stars because it was kinda bland so I added some ingredients. Subbed the red wine vinegar for apple cider vinegar and the ketchup for chili sauce. Also used minced fresh garlic instead of garlic powder. Omitted the sugar altogether based on previous reviews and added about 1/2 tsp of dried rosemary and a splash of worcheshire sauce. My roast was bone in loin (just under 3lbs) and frozen..threw in the crock frozen and cooked on high for the first 2 hrs and low for another 3. Not really at all the recipe as written but a great starting point. Very easy to customize to individual tastes. The pork was super tender & juicy, not dry at all and flavorful. Used the juices in the crock and a little Wondra to make an awesome gravy to serve with it. Will definitely make again.

This is hte best pork roast I have ever had! I threw some potatoes in for the last 2 hours and then mashed them with some of the onions. The juice made an excellent gravy...yummy meal that everyone enjoyed!

This was great. I had guests and all enjoyed it. I did not add a thing, even after reading reviews. I used more pork than it called for because it weighed more and it still was great.

I made this recipe exactly as written and it was fantastic!  The meat was very tender and flavorful.  I served it with a toasted hamburger bun and bbq sauce for my husband, and I ate it just as it was out of the pot and we both loved it.  I agree with the previous poster--it's not fair to rate a recipe down when you change it.

I made this today and it was delicious! I added potatos and baby carrots but didn't change anything else. The meat was tender and juicy and the veggies were perfect. This was a great crock pot meal and I will definately make it again.

Yum! Very simple for a lot of flavor. The pork was nice, tender, and juicy. I made a gravy with the sauce and it was awesome! I put the potatoes in the crock with the pork (like some have suggested), but they came out tasting goofy. Not a good sauce for potatoes, but this recipe wasn't for the potatoes...it was a success in my book for the pork!

I used a bone in Pork Roast and the only complaint I have was the fat.  So the second time I made this I put the fat side down for a few hours and then turned it over and skimmed the fat off.  It turned out 100% better the second time and made great pulled pork sandwiches.  we will make this again and again.

I've made this twice with the first time being far more tastier, tender, perfect tasting than the second.. What did I do different?  It think it was the cut, the first time I used a rib roast with the bones in, and slow cooked it for 12 hours on low.  I had used a finely cut apple too instead of the ketchup.  THe second time was a cheaper cut of roast I can't recall what type.

My sauce was pretty watery, but good flavor.  I wouldn't use any less ketchup as suggested by others.  Maybe even go a little more with most ingredients.

Very good and easy since I had all the marinade ingredients. Next time I will brown the roast before putting in the crock pot. Maybe it will help the meat to stay more moist.

This was so good that after making it for the first time in November, I made it again for Christmas Day. Everyone raved about the taste and the tenderness of the meat! The only change I made was to double the sauce/gravy while halving the amount of sugar. Thanks for this great recipe keeper - it's what for dinner tonight again!

Excellent.  Based on previous reviews, I added a bit extra Tabasco (maybe 4 shakes instead of one) and used apple cider vinegar because I didn't have the red wine vinegar.  Our guests showed up early, so I didn't have time to make the gravy everyone raved about, but I will next time.  I served it with mashed potatoes and the maple-dill carrots on this same site.

I was hesitant to try this recipe after reading some of the negative reviews but I went ahead and did it anyway and was very pleased with the results. The pork loin came out juicy and flavorful. The only change I made to the original recipe was to substitute minced garlic for the garlic powder and to use only 1/8th cup of sugar. Oh, and I added 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper as I did not have hot pepper sauce. The roast was delicious and I served it with rice pilaf. After dinner I shredded the leftover pork and put it back in the pot with the remaining juices and onions and let it sit in the fridge overnight. Then for dinner the next day I made pulled pork sandwiches on wheat hoagie rolls with swiss cheese and tomatoes and they were delicious. Very tangy and full of flavor. I will definitely hold on to this recipe.

I made this recipe with just a few changes.  I poked half a dozen slits in the roast when I put it in the slow cooker to make sure the liquid could permeate the roast.  Secondly, I put an extra onion (cut in rings) under the roast. After the roast was done, everyone loved eating the onions too. There isn't much tang in the roast with only a dash of hot sauce in the liquid; next time I will add about 1/2 tsp to 1 tsp of hot sauce.  The sugar in the liquid cuts down the heat in the hot sauce. I would serve a bowl of the cooked liquid "au jus" with the roast as it has a wonderful tangy flavor.  I will definitely make this again!

I made this roast as the recipe stated except for cutting the sugar in half as recommended by several reviewers and it was pretty darn good as a roast, but my favorite was taking the leftovers and making pulled pork sandwiches. I shredded the roast, added the juice from the crock pot just to make it nice and wet and then added sweet baby ray's barbeque sauce and WOW!!!

I made this with a few modifications.  I rubbed the meat with a little black pepper, salt and paprika and inserted a garlic clove in slit.  I cut back the vinegar and soy sauce and added a tablespoon of worchestershire sauce.  The juices made a really good gravy.  My husband put the gravy on bread after the meat was gone because he liked it so much.

This is awesome !!! Didn't have any red wine vinegar, used 2 Tbls. reg.  vinegar. Roast (pork sirloin) was frozen, so cooked on high for 4 hours then low for 1 hour. Used minced garlic, as i didn't have garlic powder and quite a few drops of hot pepper sauce ( like things with a bit of a kick !!) Excellent recipe !!!!! Thanks for sharing !!!

This is a keeper recipe! I increased the liquid & seasonings to make about 1-1/2C for a 1-1/4 lb. roast and it was perfect; otherwise, the liquid amount seemed too little. I used beef broth instead of water, red wine 1/4C (not vinegar) and was liberal with all seasonings. It was EXCELLENT!! Thank you~

Very good. I made this with white vinegar, as it was all I had, and sprinkled in minced garlic with the onion rather than using garlic powder. As some reviews said the flavor doesn't really penetrate the meat, but in my house with a 4-year-old it works out perfectly--we are eating the flavorful outside and he is eating the plainer middle of the meat. Before putting the meat in the slow cooker I did sear it and deglaze the pan, which added another layer of flavor to the mix. All in all, very good and I would make this again.

The roast itself was rather bland as some other reviewers have noted, but the leftovers were great for barbequed pork sandwiches. I shredded, added lots of BBQ sauce and heated in a nonstick pan on med low for about 1/2 hour. Topped with carmelized onions and provolone on a grilled hard roll...terrific.

The sauce was delicious - one tip I have though is to make sure your roast is completely covered with the sauce. I used a crockpot that was too big and the exposed meat ended up drying out. I will make this again, but make sure to either double the sauce or use a smaller crock pot. Overall this was a good easy recipe.

My husband doesn't like onions, so I substituted sliced potatoes under the roast..added onion powder instead.  When I first lifted the lid I was disapointed, it didn't have that nice brown color, but I whisked some cornstarch and gravy master with warm water to make a paste & added it to the broth in a saucepan to make a quick gravy and it was unbelieveable!  Great recipe, Thanks!

This is a winner!  As I was assembling this, I was a bit wary of the ingredients, but it tasted great.  I used brown sugar and apple cider vinegar as that was what I had.  Also added 6 cloves of minced garlic.  I fork pulled the pork and let it simmer for an hour.  Served over buttered noodles one night and on sandwiches the next.

Very good recipe!  Even my picky 4 year old loved it.  I used chicken broth instead of water as others suggested. I also used cider vinegar instead of red wine vinegar.  I doubled the sauce since my family likes alot of sauce.  It is a little thin but we didn't mind that.  Thanks for the great recipe K!  
I followed this recipe exactly the second time and it was just as good!

I made this recipe exactly as shown. The sauce is very soupy, so I did as others suggested and simmered on the stove with cornstarch to thicken.  I served over egg noodles and it was very good.  I do wish that the sauce was thicker so I wouldn't have to reduce it.

People, people! This is just wrong.  I doubled the sauce as sugeested.  This wasn't really bad it just wasn't good.  As someone suggested we tried the next day to eat it shreeded with BBQ sauce. The leftovers won't have gotten eaten any other way.  This just fell flat.  Will not make this again.  Everyone got excited because they thought I was making "marinated pork strips" form this site.  They were really disappointed.

This recipe is excellent.  I used balsamic vinegar instead of the red wine vinegar.  At the end i took the roast out and added some corn starch to the sauce to thicken it, very good.

This pork roast was super tender.  I doubled all af the liquid ingred. Used beef broth and water.  I also used balsalmic vineger instead of the red wine vinegar.  I kept the sugar at 1/8 cup.  The sauce is good when thickened with cornstarch.  I also put everything together the night before, so it marinaded the meat.  yummy!  I will definately make this again.

I've never seen my husband eat so much meat!  I used about 1/8 cup of sugar, per other reviews, and increased the tabasco sauce by about 1 tsp.  I also came home at lunch to check out the meat and added some more tabasco on top as well as basted to meat.  I added flour to the drippings (not low fat) to make a gravy which had a lot of zing, but was not too spicy to enjoy!  We really enjoyed this recipe and made good use of leftover meat by using it in quesadillas.  This recipe is so easy and definitely a keeper!

After reading the reviews on this recipe, I took heed and did some variations of my own.  I seasoned the meat with coarse pepper and Mrs Dash garlic and herbs.  I pierced the  meat and stuffed garlic  cloves in it.  I then browned it in garlic flavored olive oil( we like garlic). In addition to the liquid stated in the  recipe I added two beef boullion cubes, a can of beef consume 2 bay leaves and a splash of marsala wine.
The meat was definitely not tangy so if that's the flavor you're going for I would say add more tang.  The meat came out flavorful and tender.   My husband can't wait to make sandwiches from it.  We'll make this one again.

This was very easy to make, smelled wonderful  while cooking, and made the pork really tender and juicy, but I was surprised by the lack of flavor.  I cut the sugar down to 2 Tbsp. and that seemed good.  I also made a gravy from the leftover juice, which we didn't care for at all.  Had an overly sweet flavor.

I didn't think this recipe gave the pork roast very much flavor.  It was very quick and easy, and it smelled very tangy but there just wasn't much flavor.  I will not make this dish again.

I'm impressed!  I agree.  This is good.  I changed some of it, but basically is same recipe.  I used a seasoned rolled pork roast; I doubled the liquid, substituting beef broth for the water and added about 2 T. barbeque sauce.  My husband now, just again, said "that was really great."  It is really tangy, but whole family loved it.

This recipe caught my attention because I was looking for something different from the traditional oven-baked pork roast.  While the pork turned out very tender, the flavor seemed very blah causing my husband to ask me not to make it again.  It definitely needs a lot more spices.

This was absolutely fabulous. I thickened the broth and it made a nice gravy. I made roasted potatoes with olive oil and rosemary to go with it. Tonight I'm going to cut up the leftover meat and make a stew with the leftover potatoes and carrots. Everyone in my family rated this a 10!

I followed many of the other suggestions for making this recipe.  I am happy I did.  I don't usually like to make changes to someone else's recipe, but the other raters were compelling.  I used Beef broth for the water, Chili Sauce for the Ketchup, Balsamic vinegar not red wine, real garlic and brown not white sugar.  I had a 4.5 pound roast so I made 4 times the sauce.  I seared it on all sides before putting it in the slow cooker.  I added carrots and potatoes after the 1st hour of cooking and my roast only  took 3.5 hours to cook on low!  It was simply delicious - the flavors were awesome. It probably was one of the most moist roasts I have ever made. I also did follow one person's suggestion, after about 1.5  hours of cooking, I used a kabob skewer to poke some wholes all over the roast.  Oh, and my roast was bone in - just to be clear.

I followed the recipe exactly and just thickened the broth at the end with a bit of cornstarch. I will admit that it didn't look very promising as it cooked, but, served with creamy mashed potatoes, this recipe received a unanimous "YUM" from the whole family. Thank you for sharing it!

We made it tonight, for our Christmas Day dinner.  It was awesome!!  I'm  BIG fan of 'easy recipes', and this could not be much simpler.  I also made boiled potatoes, and some fresh/steamed broccoli.  Hubby is happy, and he rarely eats pork, but he said it was great!  Hooray!!

Please don't listen to those who say this has no taste. This is delicious! My husband took one bite, looked up at me and said, "This is good!" Made exactly as contributed. The broth was great to have on hand. When the meat was done, I just cooked my egg noodles until they were almost done, removed the meat from the crock, and dumped the noodles right in the broth. I tossed them well, added a bit of butter and even my picky teen raved and went back for seconds. A keeper!!

Delicious slow cooked meal on a cold day!  Just made this last night.  I pretty much doubled all of the ingredients (except the pork), and added in baby carrots.  the onion were so incredibly tender, and the pork was moist and juicy.  No need to sear beforehand.  I'm probably going to take all the sauce remaining and slow cook a bunch of onions as I couldn't stop eating them.  Take some of the sauce in a bowl and cool it down.  Mix with flour until no lumps remain, then stir it in to the slow cooker 30 min before the roast is finished, and you'll have an awesome gravy/sauce to go with the pork.

I decided to try this as I had all of the ingredients on hand and it looked fairly easy to prepare.  Only change I made was that I used brown sugar (about 3 TBS.) and used garlic cloves (2) in place of the garlic powder.  This turned out so tender and YUMMY!
Next time I think I will add some carrots and baby potatoes to the crock pot for a one pan meal!
Thanks for the awesome recipe.

I made this while on vacation at the beach with my entire family, thinking it would be something simple and good to eat healthwise. Every single person at the table LOVED this pork...even the 9 year old who we have to talk into eating everything, went back for seconds! Moist, tangy, savory...perfect! Thanks for this one!

If you have made sweet soy sauce chicken before, you will love this recipe. The kick to this recipe is the red wine vinegar which gives it a slight tanginess but not too tangy and the hot sauce is just enough where you can taste it but not where its super hot. This was so easy to put together and it tasted delicious. I cut up potatoes after adding the onions and my potatoes came out filled with flavor. I doubled all the ingredients just to make sure I got the maximum impact of flavor and it totally worked. I definitely recommend this recipe. This one is going in my recipe box for sure.

Very good roast! I'm not a big fan of pork but out of the slow cooker with a yummy sauce I start liking it and will make it again and again.

This recipe is so easy and delicious. One of the reviews mentioned piercing the roast, before placing it in the crock-pot. I used the fork from a carving set to do that and was happy with the results.

Loved this!  I made it exactly as written and then shredded the pork and put it back in the slow cooker for about an hour.  I served it on onion rolls.  My husband would not stop raving about this for 4 days and told everybody about it.  This will definitely be served again and again.  Thank you!!!

Quick, easy and delicious! I added minced garlic, dried parsley, onion powder and garlic powder to my sauce.  Cooked it on low for 7 hours and it was falling apart and juicy.  Even my picky teenager liked it! Thanks!!

I followed the recipe for the most part, but before placing roast in crock pot, I pierced the roast on the fat side 9-10 times, just enough to insert a slice of garlic. I then placed roast in the crock pot, fat side up on top of the onions, added a dozen baby carrots at the perimeter. I added two teaspoons of hot (chinese) mustard and one teaspoon coarse ground horseradish to the sauce. Blended well and poured over the roast and set to low temp on the crock pot. Well liked by all who tried.

I had a feeling there was too much water in this recipe. I should have listened to my instincts. Way too watery! The flavor was OK, my husband and I didn't rant & rave over it. The pork loin was very juicy & tender but that is expected when cooking with a crockpot. Next time I'll use a lot less water, if I do this recipe again. As for ANY crockpot roast recipe, I need to remember that the roast makes it's own juice, so not much water is needed.

I made this for New Year's Day so we could have our traditional pork dinner.  I put it in the crock pot on high for about 2.5 hours and it was perfect.  Such great flavor!  And so tender!!  

I recommend turning about half way through cooking if possible so that the flavor from the liquid soaks into both sides.  I didn't realize this until too late and one side was definitely more juicy and flavorful than the other.  I will be making this again!

My family & I loved this .  It was tender and flavorful. It was done in about 3 hours, so I took it out and refrigerated it until dinner then reheated it in a sauce pan.  I served it with California Potato Salad & it was a wonderful combination.

I absolutely loved this.  I didn't have red wine vinegar, so I used some Apple Cider Vinegar.  I also filled the crock pot with diced red potatoes and carrots.  The veggies have an amazing flavor and I love this!  I will be making it again.

Excellent as is, or a base for other recipes. I make it exactly as listed, except I use apple cider vinegar because that's what's in the cupboard, and fresh garlic because I prefer it. And I increase the quantities because I have a large family and buy large roasts.

The first day I serve it as a main meat dish, with potatoes or rice (the sauce is great over rice) and a veggie. I use the remaining meat to make pulled -pork sandwiches with Sticky Finger's sauce (my favorite), or pork tacos with Taco Slaw from this site, or sweet and sour pork. Next I want to try a pork chili with the meat as a base.

Wonderful! I made it (shock of shocks) without changing a thing. My family ALL thought it was delicious and grumbled a great deal because I didn't make a double batch (there were six of us with the two youngests being 14 and 17.) This is going on my Tuesday Slow Cooker Meal list!

This turned out ok. I used the suggestions of others and subbed the white sugar for brown, cut the amount in half, omitted the water but doubled the sauce and browned the roast before putting it in the Crock pot. Even then the taste was a little sweet but was good, the problem was that it just wouldn't penetrate the meat even when I pricked it throughout. In the end I had to cut the meat into small pieces and baste them.

Pretty good; very mild flavor.  I made the recipe just as described (but doubled everything), and my husband and I ended up mixing a little BBQ sauce because it was too bland for our taste.  The pork was so tender though.

The meat was very tender and quite good EXCEPT for the very sweet flavor.  If I make this again, I would absolutely NOT add sugar.  I added potatoes and carrots part way through the cooking.  It was just an "okay" recipe.

A little bland. I doubled all the spices (per other reviewers), but also the water too and maybe should have left the water at 1 cup. I used a pork tenderloin, not pork loin roast and don't know if this would make a difference in flavor or moisture as the meat was a little dry and had to pour crock pot juices over it. I cooked with carrots and potatoes, but it made them a sweet but spicy and less desirable flavor. Likely will not be making this again.

I doubled and tripled the spices in this recipe and since my roast was frozen I put it on the night before and cooked it on low until the next morning. (turning it down to 'keep warm' until lunch.) It turned out really good in my opinion and just good in my husbands. My favorite part has to be the onions, they are so full of flavor. Next time I will pull all the meet apart in the morning and eat it like shredded pork.

Nice and tender in the slow cooker, but I prefer a different flavor for my pork.  (I thought it was a bit too vinegar-y.)  My mother and my husband both loved it, though.  My kids thought it was just OK.

I agree with others that the pork itself was pretty bland though quite tender. We ended up putting BBQ sauce on it and it was great. The onions actually tasted really good- maybe they soaked up all the flavor?

When I saw the title of this recipe, I thought "ooh!"  When I saw the ingredients, I thought "oh?"  However, I gave it a try.  The best part of this recipe was the onions.  They came out perfectly tender and VERY tasty.  The pork, however, not so much.  VERY dry, and had very little flavor.  I think you'd almost have to triple the ingredients to get any flavor into the meat.   hence the low rating for the recipe as it sits.  However, I really think this recipe would make a better (overnight) marinade for roasting the pork in the oven rather than in a slow cooker.  It also probably wouldn't be bad to make this as a marinade, then put some aside to inject into the pork before roasting it.  The recipe has potential, but needs a few tweaks.

This didn't seem special at all.  Maybe because I had it on high for 4 hrs instead of low?  The sauce was thin when done and didn't taste like anything memorable.

Good enough for everyday meal. Nothing super special here though, IMO. The sauce was more of a broth, guess I was expecting something thicker. But it was tasty, so I'll probably make it again.

This was very tasty!!  Made it as said, but didn't have onion.  My pork loin was so moist that it actually shredded like pulled pork so we made sandwiches with it and put BBQ sauce on top.  Was very yummy.  I may try adding a little liquid smoke to it next time to give it a little smokey flavor...  Will make again for sure...

Very rich and tasty.  I slow-cooked on LOW for 5 hours and the temp inside registered 165-170 degrees.  Don't overcook or the meat will be dry.  It needs a bit more liquid to go over meat or make gravy with.  I also recommend browning the roast on all sides to give it a little color and flavor.  Thanks for recipe!

Made this for dinner tonight!  Very juicy and fork-tender, good flavor.  I made it exactly like the recipe said.  Like that there are leftovers; and also the onions are good accompaniment to the roast when serving.  Will make this again!

I give it a 5. 
I cooked the recipe just as given and my roast turned out very tender and tasty.
I added the juices from the crock pot to my cooked egg noodles, no butter needed. The onions in the crock pot juices were very tasty and sweet. Served with fresh carrots.

I really liked this recipe. Make it exactly as specified except used turbinado surgar (I've a huge container of it and use whenver I can) instead of white. I probably should have cooked a little shorter time, though. We made sandwiches.

while this is definitely sweet, I added a bit more than a dash of hot sauce so it countered it pretty well, will definitely make again but will lower sugar/ketchup as others did.

Made this today for my wife, sister-in-law & mother-in-law. They all loved it! The most tender moist roast ever! I trimmed off some of the fat and sprinkled it with KC Butt Rub then followed directions. This is definitely a keeper! Next time maybe 2 sliced onions.

This recipe was okay. Reduced the sugar added more spices, but first I browned the roast on top of the stove.

Yummy and easy! I used the leftovers for enchiladas. I simmered the meat in green chili sauce and topped with homemade enchilada sauce from this site!

Not my favorite - but really my own fault. I added a bag of frozen veggi's and by the end, it was a hot, soggy mess. I will say that the pork was incredibly moist.

I love pork and I love slow cookers, so naturally I was excited to try this, but from preparation to consumption I was extremely underwhelmed.  We later re-cooked it with taco seasoning and made burritos out of it.

Great easy way to make pork. I cut mine into 3 equal parts due to a smaller slow cooker and seared the outside. I think it was overcooked at 6 hours though.

The other morning I was in a rush to get something planned for dinner, I searched recipes  and came across this one.  I threw it together really fast and ran out the door for the day.  My whole family enjoyed this meal.  The meat was so tender and flavorful.

This was really good, though I did nearly triple the sauce ingredients (which turned out to be liquid, like others said, that needed some starch to thicken before serving).  I had a pork roast I needed to cook, and my boyfriend (who doesn't generally eat pork) said, "I don't even like pork, but this is really good!".  The cooked onions were great as well.  Served with a Spanish rice and some glazeded carrots.  Great dinner.  Leftovers were shredded for a pork barbecue (that we BOTH look forward to!) to serve on rolls. Thanks!

My DH absolutely can't get enough of this. I never use plain water as an ingredient to anything, so I used a can of beef consumme', and brown sugar instead of white. Also upped the amounts of the other ingredients, and used fresh crushed garlic cloves as well. I had a pork shoulder roast, and this recipe really fit the bill. Fabulous! Thank you for your submission of this recipe.

This recipe was very good.  The meat was very tender with a nice flavor.  Not real spicy, but just a nice taste.  And, very easy to put together.  My little boy asked for seconds.  (my little girl didn't like).  But, I will be using this recipe again.

This was pretty good. I followed the recipe, except I used less sugar and added potatoes, carrots, and onions to the slowcooker, as others suggested.  The vegetables were very flavorable, but the meat did not have much of the taste of the sauce/seasonings.  That was fine since the vegetables tasted so good.  I would make this again and try pricking the meat all over first as other suggested to see if it soaked in more flavor.

I found this just OK. I upped the spices and reduced sugar as others suggested and I don't know if that made it better or worse, as I've never made it before. I won't make it again -- I didn't like the vinegary flavour.

Wonderfully moist pork roast!! I increased the amount of spices, but the roast flavor was just sort of bland. I had used a 4 lb pork shoulder blade roast, so I think the spices needed to be at least doubled. I'll try it again though...loved the moist meat! UPDATE 2/25/14 I've been making this recipe with the changes posted by Linda Y (I give it 5 stars now). Absolutely delicious. The flavor reminds me of Oriental sweet & sour pork from a restaurant in my childhood years! I always serve it over steamed Jasmine rice. I retyped the version I like and have it in my FAV recipe book for easy look up.

YUMMY!!! My boyfriend made this today for dinner and it was delicious! I was not expecting the sweetness but didn't mind it, next time I might cut the sugar just to see what happens. We added potatoes as did many others. This is sooo simple and has a lot of opportunity to play around with, can't wait to make it again!

my wife loved the smell throughout the house and it was great served with buttered egg noodles, but bottom line...the kids and I thought it was a bit dry.  We cooked on low in the slow-cooker for approximately 7 hours.  Possibly cooking a shorter time would help.

This recipe was wonderful! I made the juices left in my slow cooker into a fantastic gravy that went so well on the pork and some mashed potatoes.  Definitely a keeper in our house!

This came out very well! I made exactly as written, only my roast was smaller (a little over a pound). I still used the same measurements because a little extra seasoning doesn't hurt! I also pierced the roast several times like another reviewer. Since it is just hubby and I, we had some left over. I shredded the leftovers and coated them with my favorite BBQ sauce which made for wonderful BBQ pork sandwiches the next day. So, it also makes an excellent base for BBQ pork!

This was the most delicious and most tender pork roast I have ever eaten..I served it with snap peas and egg noodles. The only variation I made was that I added butter and parmesan cheese to the noodles. My family gobbled it all up! I would give it 10 stars if I could!

Great recipe! After cooking, I sliced roast and put in broiler for a few minutes to brown. I took all leftover sauce, chopped one onion slice and boiled in saucepan until a creamy reduction sauce.

I had a top loin roast and found this recipe. My husband actually put it together for me and it turned out great! (even a husband can do this one)I stayed with the noodles and sugar snaps as suggested but I used the broth out of the crock pot to cook the noodles in and boy were they great. Thanks for the great recipe.

I let the roast and onions sit in the sauce all night in the fridge. After the roast was done, I took it out, shredded it, and added a few tablespoons of terriyaki sauce, a squirt of soy sauce and a few drops of sesame seed oil. Served on buns....SO DELISH!

This was the best slow cooker pork I've ever made!  It was so juicy and you could taste the tangy flavor all the way through the meat.  I used half the sugar as a lot of reviewers recommended.  I also added sliced carrots and about 6 extra dashes of hot sauce which gave it a nice kick.  YUMM!

At first I was skeptical of why this recipe got so many good reviews, as I thought it was a little bland at first, but after a few bites I decided I liked it.  My 2-year-old ate seconds and my husband devoured it.  All I changed was to cut back the sugar by a tablespoon or so and threw some potatoes in as well.

This was tasty. Not out of the park awesome, but tasty. The sauce was very thin, though. I'm not sure how to change that, but that was probably my only complaint.

This recipe came out very nice--excellent flavor and very tender. Next time I will reduce the sugar by about half, as it was a little too sweet for my family's taste. I also added 4 peeled and chunked potatoes and some baby carrots. I cooked it on high for 4 hours. During the last hour, I flipped the roast and began basting with the sauce every few minutes. Veggies were perfectly cooked. Everyone was happy. :-)

Great pork recipe.  I try to use my slow cooker as often as possible during the school year to make my evenings easier.  The pork was juicy and tender with terrific flavor.  Everyone enjoyed it for dinner and 1 person got to enjoy a pork sandwich the next day.  Served with asian quinoa and soy mushrooms - will definitely use again!

My family loved it.  My four year old had 3 helpings!  I did not add the onion and had to substitute apple cider vinegar for the red wine vinegar.  Instead of ketchup I used a small can of Italian Tomato paste and I didn't use the hot pepper sauce.  I added small red potatoes also.  It was great and had it again for lunch today.

Pretty good.  I made it exactly as written - gotta know what its supposed to taste like before you go changing it!  It might have been a little sweet for my taste (and I do like sweet).  The only thing I did different was sear the roast before putting it in the crock, as I always do.  Added baby carrots and thickened broth to make more of a gravy.  With cheddar mashed potatoes, was one yummy meal !!  Thanks

Success! I love cooking this because I love cooking anything in a crock pot - SO easy. I'm not the biggest fan of pork roast, but I thought this was delicious. E loved it (but he would eat a hunk of meat any day). I usually line the bottom of the slow cooker with onions and the sides with baby carrots, and put the pork roast in the middle. I serve it over rice. This works out great because even if I come home from work late and it's cooked a little too long, it's still just as delicious.

I try to make a new recipe every week so I decided to try this one while we had company and I am so glad I did!! Super easy and amazingly delicious!!  I took the advice of others and doubled the sauce but did not double the sugar.  I added some mushrooms and carrots and they were also just as good.  I served it with garlic mashed potatoes that we poured the sauce overtop.  All in all a great meal!

This was very dry and totally tasteless.  I doubled the spices as some suggested and it did nothing to improve it.  I gave it 2 stars because when I shred it and add bar-b-q sauce it will make great sandwiches, I hope.

I didn't do anything different than what the recipe called for, other than thicken the juice after I took the roast out in order to make gravy.  It was DELICIOUS.  It was very flavorful and moist.  I served it with mashed potatoes.  I will definitely be making this one again.

I was SO looking forward to making this recipe and was extremely dissapointed.  I had a really nice pork roast and followed the directions.  I'm an experienced cook but maybe I did something wrong. ???

I only gave it 3 stars because it was just TOO SWEET for my taste (and that's after I cut down the sugar and ketchup!).  However, I'm still keeping this recipe as a base for other pork roasts that I'll do in the future.

This is a great sauce for a pork roast.   I wanted a richer sauce so I cooked it as the recipe called and whipped up more sauce on ther side.  Pretty good.  I added lots of veggies.

This was pretty good.  Seems like a good base recipe to start with.  Will make again.  My 3 year old actually ate it, winner in my book.

I found this flavorless. There was no tang to it at all. I had to add a bunch of pepper to the juice to make it tangy when I made the gravy.

I used balsamic vinegar for the red wine vinegar and 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper for the hot sauce, but the rest of the recipe was followed as written. This tastes a lot like a teriyaki sauce, which is a compliment from me. It was delicious. I served with peas and potatoes.

This pork roast was delicious.  I made a couple of adjustments to utilize what I had on hand.  In place of the water, I used beef broth, as I had some open in the fridge that needed to be used up.  I also only had 1 Tbls. of the red wine vinegar, so I substituted apple cider vinegar for the remaining 2 Tbls.   I did not add the salt, because I used the broth instead of the water, which was salty enough.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.  The pork was tender, and moist.  The only thing I would probably do next time is cut back on the sugar a bit.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made the recipe exactly as directed and had great results.  I thought the sauce mixture complemented the pork well and didn't overpower it.  When the roast was done cooking, I took it out, sliced it, and returned the meat back into the juices in the slow cooker while I finished preparing dinner.  Thanks!

We absolutely loved this recipe!  And like everything with the slow cooker, so easy!! The juice is great for pouring back over the meat, or on potatoes.  Definitely the best roast I have ever had!

This recipe was wonderful!!! I loved the tangy flavor it gave to the pork. After it was done cooking, I took about 2 Cups of the broth and added flour to make a gravy for on top of the meat. SO YUMMY!

Wow! Is this good stuff! Amazingly easy, too. I cooked it on high about 3 hours and it was so moist and tender. I added carrots to the crock as well as using a touch less sugar than called for. I left the broth thin, as that's how we prefer it. Later, I added potatoes and chicken stock to the left-overs and turned it into a wonderful soup. I plan to follow this same recipe using chicken in place of pork, and have no doubt that it will be just as much of hit.   Wonderful recipe...thanks for sharing!

Update...I wanted to do a bean soup in the slowcooker and needed a simple base. I used the ingredients from this recipe, minus the pork. The end result was unbelievably delicious, loaded with flavor! I think this perfect blend of ingredients would be wonderful as a starting point for a great many dishes.

Very good recipe.  Cooked 2 lb roast for 6 hrs.  Added fingerling potatoes, baby carrots and 1/2 can pineapple chunks  2 hours into cooking.  Thickened sauce with cornstarch to make a gravy.

This was so good!  I did change a few things, I doubled all the ingredients with the exception of the liquid, I substituted coke for the broth.  I also used balsamic vinegar.  It smelled so good cooking.  This was a very good and very easy dish.

Great! I tossed potatoes into the cooker also and they absorbed the flavor of the sauce. Served on the side with onions on the top, they were quite good just as is -- no butter or other toppings necessary. The roast was tasty and juicy. Thanks for sharing.

Very nice recipe.  Changed it a bit by browning the onions and pork first, didn't bother adding the sugar, deglazed the frying pan with the water and used real garlic cloves.  The pork was a touch dry and only cooked it for 4 1/2 hours on low but I find my crock pot usually cooks high.  Pouring the juice from the bottom over the pork took care of that and boosted the flavour too.  Will definitely do this one again.  Thanks!

Hmmm, this was good but it came out strange looking.  The top of the roast was completely white and the bottom was the color of the sauce.  Not very appealing.  We liked the flavor of the sauce but it did not permeate the meat, so next time I will pierce with a fork before cooking and turn it over half way through the cooking time.  I am going to take other reviewers's advice and make BBQ pork sandwiches with the leftovers.  I served it with mashed potatoes and next time will thicken the sauce before serving.

I trimmed visible fat from the roast before cooking and found the meat to be very dry, even after cooking only five hours on low heat.  The sauce was also very thin.  If I make it again, I will add some potatoes and carrots rather than try to use the sauce over noodles, rice or potatoes.

I had a boneless pork shoulder that was over 4 lbs., so I doubled the ingredients and let it cook on low for a little over 9 hours, and it was excellent.  I did follow the advice of other reviewers and inserted six or seven garlic cloves, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  It was a hit with everyone at the table. My husband even raved about this dish, which is very unusual!

Due to the Asian influence taste, I added the entire contents of a 6 oz jar of pickled ginger to the crock pot. I took a risk having never tried this recipe and am glad I did because the results were phenomenal! I served it over white rice. Thanks, K, for sharing!

This was my first time making pork roast and it was to die for! I only made a few changes using what I had on hand (bbq sauce instead of ketchup, rice vinegar instead of red wine vinegar) When I came home after 10 hours in the crockpot the meat was so tender and juicy it was falling apart as I pulled it from the pot. I had added some potatoes and carrots the sauce completely infused them making them delicious! I recommend this to everyone!

Very good.  I thought after reading the other reviews that this would be too sweet.  It was actually perfect; the onions absorb a lot of the sweetness & make a wonderful sauce.  I doubled the recipe because I had a larger pork roast; would definated increase the sauce when following this recipe for the size roast listed.  I added extra garlic flakes and season-all salt.  Also sliced up about 6 small potatos and 4 carrots and threw them on top. Added 1 additional onion.  If you're planning to make this a meal, definately add the extra veggies.  Served with biscuits.  Flavor, particularly of the sauce is good, and not overwhelming.

This was so great and so easy!  I used brown sugar (all I had) and added two capfulls of Simply Orange juice w/pineapple. So very good.

I never have to much luck with pork roasts for some reason but this one turned out real tender and juicy.  Before serving I pulled it apart into big chunky pieces and threw it in the oven with some bbq sauce to perk the flavor up at bit.  My husband really liked it and he is not a big pork fan.

I tripled the seasonings, and there was no taste to it. Where was the "Tang"? It was bland, and believe it or not, it became dry. Was a real nice roast to begin with. I cooked it for 6.5 hours.

It was delicious! The meat was perfectly tender and the tangy taste was amazing. It will be made and enjoyed again. Perhaps a bit sweet, but overall wonderful.

I made everything just as the recipe calls for except I didn't use the slow cooker.  I simply used an oven bag, first couple hours at 350 then an hour at 250.  Everyone loved this one and the veggies with it were excellent.

This is AMAZING.  We have used it for pork loins and chicken breast.  Both are great.  If we get tired of the tangy taste, we put it on sandwiches with bbq on top.  I LOVE it, and my fiance loves it even more.  Thank you SO, SO much.

I like others here made some changes to this recipe: I doubled all ingredients in the sauce and added the following:  1 large tbsp of seeded mustard 1 tbsp of hot curry powder 1 tbsp of tomato paste 1 clove of minced garlic (omitted the garlic powder) 1 tbsp of arrowroot powder (to thicken you could use flour, corn flour what have you).  YUM! I like my food with quite a bit of 'kick' to it. I'm going to serve it with potato salad, steamed greens and fresh, warm bread.

All I can say is MMMMMmmmmMMMMMM!  Whole family loved it... served with brown basmati rice and steamed broccoli.  I found it to be more sweet than tangy but that is ok, it was good, I did reduce the sugar by half like I had read in another review. Will make again, definately!!!

It was OK, I will probably make it again with a few adjustments.  I tend to like a little more heat, so I will add some dry pepper flakes.

Very tasty, I received lots of compliments.  I doubled the sauce recipe because the original amount barely covered the bottom of the pork. I have a larger than usual crock pot I assume. Will definately make this one again.

My husband and I really liked this.
I used two smaller pork roasts (bought at costco) and lined the bottom with potatoes before the onions.  Then I placed the pork roasts on top and filled in the sides with large carrot chunks.  I used the sauce exactly as listed.  It was wonderful.  It was also great the next day when we took the remainder of the roast with equal parts sauce and barbecue sauce and made pulled pork sandwiches!

AWESOME!!! This recipe is worth making over and over, and if you have leftovers just make BBQ pulled pork sandwiches.  I would not recommend making with carrots and potatoes because they turned out VERY sweet, but the roast is amazing

I have made this a few times and it always turns out great! When I make this I double the sauce. I have even used different types of vinegar and I think that apple cider vinegar is the best. I usually serve with mashed taters and green beans with garvy made from the extra sauce.

This recipe is a keeper!  I made it last night for some friends and it got good reviews from all.  I made the following changes: seared the pork, doubled the sauce with the exception of the sugar and used brown sugar instead of white.  I made the sauce in the pan I seared the pork to be sure to get all the good bits and juices left behind.  I also did everything the night before so the pork had 8 hours to "marinate" in the sauce.  I think this made a huge difference in not drying out the pork.  I thickened the sauce with cornstarch and served it with buttered noodles and roasted veggies.  Will definitely make this again.

This was a great recipe for a large dinner party.  I doubled the recipe and it served 8 healthy portions.  I added baby carrots and celery to the crock pot along with the rest of the ingredients and slow cooked everything for about 10 hours.  It was delicious!  I left out the sugar because i thought it would be too sweet.  I served the pork with buttered noodles and red potatoes.  Carbs.....YUM!

This just melted in my mouth and my 2-year-old cleaned out her plate, wow! I was going to make another rump roast recipe but noticed that I was missing a key ingredient so I used this recipe with beef...and it was heavenly. I used a meat tenderizer on all sides of the roast and inserted 2 cloves of garlic into 4 cuts on the top. I added fluids on top of the roast every hour or so. I also cut up some Idaho potatoes, carrots and yellow onion and placed them under the roast...and after 8 hours on low, everything was just perfect. I doubled the recipe (except for sugar) and made wonderful gravy from the juices, and still have enough to freeze for another gravy. I can't believe that a $5.00 piece of beef can feed a family for at least 3 meals! I'm planning to mix the shredded meat with some bbq sauce tomorrow and make sandwiches.

It was really good, I especially loved the onions with it!  As another reviewer suggested, I used brown sugar instead of white which I think gave a better taste.

Giving it 4 stars because my hubby doesn't care much for "sweet" meat. I used a 10-oz can of Campbell's French Onion Soup undiluted, in place of the salt, water/broth, and onion. Another change was using balsamic vinegar in place of red wine vinegar, and teriyaki instead of soy. Great basic recipe; sorry for all the changes but I used what I had and the improvisation was great. Kids ages 8 and 10 loved it. Served with steamed broccoli and garlic toast. Thanks for the post; it's in my keeper box!

This was fantastic and super easy to make.  By far the best new recipe I have tried this year!  I followed the suggestions of some others and pierced the loin many times with a fork so it would soak up the flavor.

Followed the original recipe (as I always do the first time) and it was great! Shredded the pork the next day, added some Kansas City bbq sauce I brought with me when I moved and had sandwiches.  This is the only way I'll make pork roast from now on!

After reading some other reviews, I changed this recipe up a little. I added half each of a red and green pepper with an onion to the bottom of the slow cooker. I also threw in a jalapeno pepper. I halved the sugar amount called for and I seasoned the meat liberally with garlic powder, black pepper, curry powder, cumin. I added the other ingredients to chicken broth instead of water and added a few dashes of hot sauce. At the end of cooking time, I made a roux and added the juices from the slow cooker to thicken it up. Then I served it over hot buttered egg noodles and a love of warm crusty italian bread on the side.  It had just a nice little kick. Fantastic.

SOOOO GOOD!!  Everyone I have made this for loved it... even my husband who hates pork!  I actually double the sauce and split the loin and serve half with veggies and mashed potatoes and the other half I just pull apart with the fork, thicken the gravy a bit and serve both over egg noodles.  So i really get a couple of meals out of this recipe.  The juice is so good as a gravy!!  I am so grateful to the author of this recipe!

Very good.  I even served it with buttered noodles and sugar snap peas like the author suggested.  My kid that doesn't like sweet meals even enjoyed it.  Fork tender.

This was so moist and delicious.  I had forgotten the recipe at work, and guessed the sauce ingredients.  I did guess a little on the shy side, so next time I will kick it up a bit.  This was wonderful with noodles, and as a sandwich the next day.  My three year old had seconds.  That never happens!

My family loved this. Pork has a tendency to be a little bland to me and this had so much flavor. This one will be added to the keepers.

I've never been much of a pork fan, but I had a pork roast to use and tried this recipe.  After making this recipe, I find my mouth watering thinking about pork roast!  I love sweet meat, and this one is fabulous!  This recipe has become a regular staple in our house.

This was heavenly!  Previous to this recipe, there were only two ways I could stand to eat pork - now there's three! :)  I didn't have as much pork as the recipe called for, but I still used the same amount of ingredients of everything else.  I did use beef broth instead of water, and I browned the pork before I put it in the crock pot, and then cooked the onion for just a minute before I put them in.  It was SO tender and delicious! Thanks!

The recipe sounds odd, but it's surprisingly great.  And if you've seen my other reviews, you know I'm a tough critic.  I used a red onion and a little less salt.  As suggested, I served this over egg noodles and I browned the meat before placing in the slow cooker.  Cabbage and potatoes makes a great side dish for this.

Great recipe!  I made gravy with the juice and it was very yummy.  I did make a few changes I added carrots and 1 can of beef stock.  I had a small roast and my crockpot is huge so it was finished after only 4 hours on low. I put the roast/veggies in the crock the night before in the fridge and in separate container mixed up the other ingredients so all that was needed in the morning is add the liquid and turn it on.

We decided to start the New Year off with a lower fat meal.  This hit the spot.  I doubled the recipe with no problem.  I used sweet onion and cooked on high for 1 hour and the rest on low.  It took about 6 hours that way. (If I wanted a pulled pork consistancy I would cook longer.) The onions were a hit with the crowd and those that didn't like onions, my kids namely, they liked the juice poured on their meat. I served this with green beans and buttered noodles.  I will be keeping this recipe!

This really turned out great and like all slow cooker recipes, it was very easy and convenient. I added 4 quartered potatoes and 2 sliced apples. They turned out really good. The sauce is pretty watery, so if you wanted you could add cornstarch to make a thicker gravy. Also, next time I will probably add the apples later or just cut into bigger pieces, as the 8 hour cook time was a little too long and they burst. Still good though!!

This was great!  I used a 1&1/2 lb pork shoulder roast because that is what I had.  I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have any hot sauce on hand.  The roast was so tender and the juices were delicious.  My husband was absolutely in love with this meal.  It couldn't have been simpler either.  

If you use a pork loin roast, this would also be a very healthy, low-fat main dish.  That is how I will make it from now on since I like the loin better.

We all loved it, and I have to agree with another reviewer..don't overcook pork, it dries out.  I added Worcestershire sauce but other than that I followed it exactly.  I'll make again.

Very, very good!  I also followed some of the suggestions and double the ingredients except for the sugar and I also used chicken broth in the place of the water.  I would thicken the sauce with corn starch and serve it over the sliced pork.  Your family and/or your guests will love this!!

This was absolutely wonderful! I layered sliced onions on the bottom, then the pork on top. Doubled the sauce recipe, but cut back to 1 tsp on the sugar as suggested. Thought it was really salty when cooking, but it was fine when done. The pork was moist but carvable and tasted great. Used salsa instead of ketchup. Used cider vinegar.
Have half the roast left and will cube it and use it mixed in to macaroni and cheese for another big meal.
I can heartily recommend this! You can adjust the sauce to your liking. I thickened it with cornstarch after removing the roast and the onions. I am not a 'barbecue' fan, but loved this.

Excellent! I am always leery of buying a pork roast because I have never made one that I actually enjoyed enough to make again, until now. I used a 4lb. bone in roast and tripled the sauce ingredients. I left out the hot sauce and I had no onions. I will definitely make his again and I will be sure to add onions because I know they would be awesome. Try this recipe!

I tried this recipe tonight and it was very good! I actually added about 2 tablespoons of honey and two tablespoons honey dijon mustard to the sauce mixture and when the roast was done I spooned out the sauce from the crock pot and added a tablespoon of water and a tablespoon of cornstarch(mixed) to a pan and thickened it for gravy. My husband and son raved! This one is a keeper!

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  I prepared it the night before and doubled the sauce. I did not have the red wine vinegar so I used apple cider vinegar and it worked well.  I let it cook all day and it was a wonderful meal after a long day at work.  Plus the house smelled great when we returned home.

My first attempt at any kind of roast.... I took it for a "Girls Night Dinner" and everyone loved it.  Just the right amount of Tang and Sweet.  Will definitely be on the repeat list.

Very delicious! Was hesitant to try the combo of ingredients, but after reading the reviews I took the plunge! Will definitely make again. I did change one thing, to reduce calories and make healthier, I used 1/8 C of splenda instead of 1/4c sugar. I too added cornstarch at the end to thicken.

This was outstanding!  The best pork roast I've had.  Very flavorful and moist.  The only change I made was to use chicken broth instead of water.  Thanks!

Yummy!  Thank you for all the suggestions everyone. I doubled the sauce in the recipe.  I ran out of time before I could sear the outside.  I didn't find it too sweet but I was also quite generous with the Tabasco hot sauce.  My other half raved about it!

This was good...not great.  The pork comes out fabulously tender, however.  It wasn't all that "tangy"...until the next day when the flavors had really permeated the meat.   I also had to thicken the sauce and next time will add double the onions...they were yummy.  There will be a second go at this one!

Good!  I also used chicken broth rather then water.  I didn’t have red wine vinegar, I used balsamic vinegar, and I also cooked my potatoes and carrots in the pot.  Crock Pots are a great tool for working Moms you throw everything in and forget about it.  I set mine on a timer so it will start and turn off on its own.   My supper is never over cooked if I’m late.

This roast came out so tender and flavorful!  I made it exactly like the recipe says, but added carrot chunks around the edges of the roast while it was cooking.  I served it with mashed potatoes, and then sliced up the leftover roast for sandwiches the next day.  I will definitely be making this again!

Very good.  I used chicken broth instead of water and cider vinegar, but followed the rest of the recipe as written.  The pork was PERFECT - tender and moist.  Great over rice.

We thought this was very tender, and delicious! I followed the recipe to a "T",except I did put sliced portabella mushrooms in the pot for the last 30 minutes of cooking. I served it with green beans, and parmesan noodles. Yummy!

Wow, this is so good!  I was sad when it was gone!  I used a can of chicken broth instead of water and added 2 Tbsp of worchestershire.  Also used 1/2 tsp of garlic powder.  I thought it was excellent and it did not get dry.  Yum!

This was delicious!  The sauce is the best.  After the roast was done, I cooked the sauce with some dehydrated mushrooms and cornstarch to thicken it and we ate it over the pork and mashed potatoes.  So flavorful and yummy!  The pork was also very moist and tender.

Excellent recipe!!  My fussy 7 year old who detests onions actually tried a piece and then actually ate a whole slice.  The are so sweet.  The meat was really tender and very tasty.  I poked the meat with a fork before I poured the marinade over the roast.  Periodically I did the same and extended the cook time.  Thanks for sharing this find.

Pleasantly surprised with this one.  I was concerned that the meat would burn with not a lot of sauce, and wasn't overly thrilled with this, but thought I'd try it.  Boy, am I glad I did!  I did make a few changes...used a 2lb roast, red cooking wine in place of the vinegar, splenda instead of white sugar, lite soy sauce, zero salt, two garlic cloves, and several dashes of tabasco!  Served on toasted wheat buns with baked beans and a salad.  Will definitely make again! Would highly recommend!

I'm not sure why a few others recently had problems with this recipe; I made it exactly as the recipe says and it was wonderful!  The meat was nice and tender and juicy (usually not the case with pork) and it had excellent flavor.  The sauce was not watery, nor was it too thick that the flavor was too intense.  I loved it, my kids loved it, and I will make it again!  Thanks for a great recipe!

If I could give this no stars I would.  We followed the recipe as is and even using pork tenderloin it came out dry.  The sauce was watery and tasted like red wine vinegar and black pepper.  My husband is on his way to pick up Arby's as I type.  What a waste of a good cut of meat.

I used 1/2 tsp crushed garlic.  I decreased the water a bit and threw in some baby carrots.  It looked grey, greasy, and unappetizing at first.  My husband did not want to touch it right out of the crock pot.  But then I went ahead, skimmed the fat off, prepared some Ramen noodles, strained out the noodles, and topped it with the sliced pork and the juices and added some steamed green beans on the side.  He ate it all up.  It was tender and very flavorful.  I want to add a bit of freshly chopped tomato and a herb like tarragon or parsley to it at the end to make it look better next time.

Surprisingly good! I'm not a big fan of sweet/savory combo flavors, but I thought I'd give it a go. I substituted cider vinegar for the red wine vinegar, and after it was done cooking I added a little cornstarch to the juices to thicken it into a sauce. Then we added the pork and sauce to toasted buns or english muffins as open-faced sandwiches. A nice change!

Yummy! My family loves it, kids too! I've already made it twice. Definitely very tasty and the slow cooker really makes the pork roast very tender and moist. I have already passed on the recipe to my mother in law and we will be making this part of our regular meals. Very delicious. Great as a burrito with beans or just over some steamed rice.

This was really good and super easy. The family enjoyed it. I followed the directions exactly.Cooked on high for 1 1/2 hrs. then on low 4 1/2 hrs.Turned the roast over every hour and basted it. Poured juices into saucepan and reduced them. Made them seem thicker and more flavorful.Will make again. Thanks.

This was quite good but I made a lot of changes to make it yummy!  First, I tripled the liquid and used apple juice instead of water and added 2 bullion cubes (chicken).  I added 2 cloves fresh garlic rather than powder--so much better!  I added apples and potatoes to the pot.  Also used half balsamic and half red wine vinegar--AND added 3 tablespoons of buffalo wing sauce (Texas Pete) because I was a little low on the vinegar.  Also, only added half of the sugar since the applejuice is sweetened.  One last thing, I cooked two cups of rice in the remaining sauce in the last hour before serving b/c some people requested rice.  The rice was soooo flavorful!!I guess this is kind of a new recipe now--but it is sooo good (that is if you like things pretty spiced up!).

AMAZING! I was not a fan of pork roast -- I made it solely for my boyfriend's benefit -- until I tried this recipe tonight. It was delicious and easy and PERFECT! It took about 3 hours on high for a 1.75 lb. pork loin roast. My boyfriend gobbled up several slices, and I ate more of it than I usually would. I've already shredded the leftovers and added some BBQ sauce for sandwiches tomorrow night! HOWEVER ... based on the suggestions I saw in the reviews, as well as based on my own intuition, I made several key changes to the recipe. 1. I tripled the sauce, except for the sugar; I used a total of 3/8 cup of brown sugar (instead of white). 2. Instead of 3 cups of water, I used 2 cups of vegetable broth and 1 cup of water (if I'd had 3 cups of  veggie broth, I would have used it -- next time, I will make sure I have enough to use 3 cups of the veggie broth. It seemed to add a good flavor.). 3. I used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar. 4. I added 2 Tbsp. of Trader Joe's BBQ sauce to the sauce mixture. 5. I added 3 Tbsp. of Master of Mixes bloody mary mix to the sauce mixture. I hope these tips are helpful. And thanks for a great recipe!

this was wonderful! I did make a few changes. 1. I doubled the liquid ingredients (except for the sugar) 2. Used brown sugar instead of white 3. Dissolved 1 small cube of beef boullion in the 2 cups of hot water 4. Used red wine vinegar with garlic flavor. My husband and I loved it! Perfectly moist and tender. Served it with 2 amazing side from this site - sugar snap peas with mint and smushed apples and sweet potatoes. Try it, you'll love it!

This pork loin comes out very tasty and tender.  My husband loves it, and I have served it to guests with rave reviews.  The only substitution I make is real garlic in the place of the powder.

This was great.  I love slow cooker meals and this was fantastic!  I added 1/2 cup of merlot wine, doubled sauce recipe without doubling the sugar and used 3 onions instead of 1.  I can't say enough about it.  My new favorite slow cooker pork recipe.

I really liked this recipe. Instead of soy sauce I used Worchestire sauce. I also, mixed 1/4 cup of Cornstarch to a cup of cold water and mixed it in the meat and juices during the last hour and let it thicken itself to a wonderful gravy which I served over baked potatoes (which next time, I will just add to the crock pot). I also, cooked  the buttery carrots recipe which went well with this recipe.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was very tender but didn't have a lot of flavor. Maybe a few spoons of bbq sauce in place of the ketchup would help.

Excellent! As others have suggested, I made extra "sauce". I actually tripled those ingredients to completely submerge the pork. I then took the roast out after 7 hours to carve it and it fell apart it was so tender! Makes great pulled pork sandwiches the next day. Real crowd pleaser!

This recipe was a hit with my family!  Based on the other reviews I did change some things, however.  I doubled the recipe as suggested, and used balsamic vinegar instead of the red wine vinegar.  I kept the sugar at 1/4 cup but will definitely use a little less next time; it turned out a bit sweet for my tastes.  I cut my loin roast into about 8 "chops" so they were fully submerged in the liquid the whole time - awesome!  I also added 1 peeled, chopped, red delicious apple in the last hour, and thickened the gravy with cornstarch.  Very, very good - and my family doesn't usually like it when I cook with fruit so that's saying something!  Will definitely make this again.

This recipe is one of the best pork roast recipes I have ever tasted. I added a little Merlot wine about 3 Tbls. plus I sprinkled the top of the roast with caraway seeds. Only cooked it for six hours on low which brought the meat temp to 170 degrees, this is the right temp so when you cut the roast it won't fall apart.  I also strained the sauce, and added
wondra flour to thicken the gravy it was subperb.  I would recommend this recipe to all who like pork, it is the best of best.

I have never gone to the trouble of rating anything but this was so darn good i had to.  Anybody who didn't think so then maybe you had some bad meat.  This was so good and i was a doubting Thomas because some reviews were just so-so.  I followed the recipe to a T.  But i didn't realize until it was time to throw the pork that i needed a  'loin roast' and instead  i had 2 smallish pork shoulders (they were on sale and i'd never bought one and they were cheap!).  Anyway, everyone who walked in after about 5 hours thought the house smelled delicious and we had some fresh bread with beans as a side and i still can't believe some folks don't think this was a hit.  Thanks so much.

I'm not a meat eater, but this truly was an excellent dish. You honestly cannot go wrong with this and the meat comes out so incredibly tender. I took the advice from others and doubled the liquid ingredients, which made the perfect amount of sauce. I added a few more seasonings, used honey in lieu of sugar and thickened the sauce at the end with a cornstarch water mixture. I served the meat over asian noodles. Thanks so much "K" for a really terrific recipe!

This was awesome.  I accidently forgot the garlic powder, but that was OK... I cooked mine on high for 3 hrs and it was perfect.  It would have been better to double the juice so that the entire meat was submerged... the top part (not in the juice) was a little on the dry side and the part that sat in the juice the whole time was divine.  I also did a gravy with the juice and some cornstarch.  Next time I will reduce the amount of sugar, too.  I'm afraid this is going to be a weekly meal..... YUM!!!!!

This recipe is not only easy but delicious.  I like to slice it up and serve it on a ham roll for a great sandwhich.  I served it with baked beans.

The whole family liked this one.  The meat just fell apart.  We used the juice to dip the meat into.  I used a cheaper cut of meat that didn't have to much fat on it.  Very good, will make again.  Michele, ontario canada

Delicious!  The roast came out of the slow cooker in three pieces because it was so tender!  The gravy, when thickened tasked great with mashed potatoes.

Really good!  I like a little more "sweet", so I increased to sugar to almost 1/2 cup.  Verrrry tender, my toddler protested until he ate the first bite.

This was a yummy dinner.  Our crockpot cooks fast, so by the time we got home and turned it off (5 hours on low) it was a little overcooked, but we poured some of the juice on top of the sliced meat and it made up for it.  My favorite part of this was the pork roast sandwiches we had for the rest of the week!!

My husband never raves about my cooking, but guess what, when I made this, he did.  He loved it and he always tells me that he doesn't like pork.  Even my 2 1/2 year old ate it without me having to "make" him.  Will definitely add this to my recipe box at home.

I wanted something easy to serve my inlaws. I read the reviews for this recipe and was a little hesitant given the broad response. But I can honestly say that this was incredible. I can't wait to make it again. It was great with egg noodles and I thickened the liquid in the Crock Pot witha a little flour for a great gravy. Thanks K!

Very tasty! My roast was 4 lbs, so I cooked it on high to make sure it was done in time.  In 5-6 hours it was just falling apart, which was lovely. Meat was nice and moist and flavourful. I cooked it with baby carrots and some small potatoes in the cooker with it, and I used minced garlic rather than garlic powder. I also substituted broth for the water. Spooned a home-made cranberry sauce over the top of the meat before cooking as well. Everyone enjoyed it, and it was all gone by the end of the meal!

The roast was good, moist and tender.  I did make several changes based on recommendations from other reviewers.  I used Red wine instead of wine vinegar, minced garlic instead of garlic powder, and chicken broth instead of water.  I whisked in 2 tbs  cornstarch to the wet ingredients before poring over the pork to help the sauce thicken. . I also seasoned the pork with salt and pepper, then browned the pork  in a pan with hot butter before putting in the crock pot.  Served with left over and reheated steamed rice and a green salad for a nice dinner that was ready when I got home.  Will make again.

I have changed the recipe and it turned out to be one of my husband's favorite! We are sauce monsters, so I used less than half the amount of blade bones from loin for just two of us. I used only 1/2 of hot water and doubled other ingredients in the sauce and replaced white sugar with brown sugar as recommended in some previous reviews. 1 Tbsp of mirin for a sweeter taste and 1/2 Tbsp Korean chili paste instead of hot sauce are added. After 6 hours being  in crockpot on low, the pork fell off the bone but wasn't tough at all. I might even try 5.5 hours next time. I took the sauce out and added a mixture of 1 tsp of corn flour and little bit of water when boiled to make it thicker. We love the recipe and will definitely make it again!!!

I made this recipe as is for my family. They loved it. I do not eat meat, I am vegetarian. They said the sweet and tangy went well together. They would like for me to make it in the future. Thank you. I will be saving this recipe.

This was absolutely delicious!!! I'm not usually a pork roast fan, but my husband tried this recipe and it was the best pork roast  I've ever had. It is flavored and seasoned to perfection.  You definitely pick up on the tangy flavor.  No modifications necessary. We will definitely be making this again!!

I followed this recipe to the letter and it turned out amazing!  I thickened the juice and it made a beautiful gravy that went great served over the roast and mashed potatoes.  Very simple to make but tastes like you slaved all day by the stove.  I will be making this again very soon.

I didn't all have all the ingredients, ended up substituting the soy sauce for teriyaki. It came really delicious.  It made the house smell wonderful. Been trying new recipes afterwards ask my husband if likes them and this recipe definitely got an  YES! It's very tasty. Next time I will try it with the soy sauce.

I have made this so many times since finding it!  My husband LOVES it, and the great part is if you have any left overs, it makes a great base for a fantastic Burrito dinner later on in the week! I use brown sugar for the sauce.

I made this exactly as stated, but didn't care for it. It was too sweet and bland. Maybe adding more seasoning or using broth instead of water would help, but I don't think I will make it again.

This was very, very easy to make and the roast was nice and moist. My only change was adding some carrots.

I'll also say that I turned on the slow cooker at 7am, set it for 8 hours on low, and we ate at around 6pm. The roast wasn't at all dry or overcooked.

I had yet to find a pork recipe that was flavorful and not overly salty.  I came home for lunch and to be honest this smelled gross as it was cooking.  I crossed my fingers, and when I opened the lid to sneak a bite before dinner I was honestly amazed.  This pork roast was so awesome!  I have four kids ages 3-12 and even each of them liked it (well, one said he didn't hate it but to me that was a win!). My husband thinks we should try to add water chestnuts in it which may not be a bad idea.  Definitely going on my rotation for menu ideas.  Thank you for sharing!

I've made this a few times now, and I feel like it has a Chinese taste to it so I serve it over rice and add egg rolls and noodles to the meal.

I followed the recipe exactly. There was no flavor left on the meat after cooking- was very bland. Will not be making this again.

I have used this recipe. I was very impressed with how tender it was, but as most of the comments read I'm going to brn my meat and some tweeking brn sugar instead of white and use my garlic ginger and maybe a little more ketchup. Thank-you

Amazing recipe, very flavourful. My son knew that roast was for supper but did not know that it was pork instead of beef. He said it was the best roast that I had ever cooked!  :)

Loved this recipe! I am glad I saved this to recipe box! It is totally awesome! Went by the exact ingredients, with the exception that I used balsamic vinegar (used 4 tbls vinegar, 3 tbls soy sauce and cut the sugar back to 1/8 cup)Before putting roast in the pot, I tenderized it first then I put half the onions on bottom and the other half on top. You could almost drink the cooking liquid by itself after being mixed.. lol..

It tastes good, but it is a little watery for pork. I doubled the ingredients but didn't add any water. I marinated it all night the night before, came out a much stronger flavor!

Very good with a boston butt. Cooked for 8 hours on low. Made a very good sauce for mashed potatoes. Will serve leftover meat with BBQ sauce. Suggest pulling leftover meat off bone and discarding fat while still warm.

Comfort food at its finest! I made some alterations based on what I had in the fridge. I used a pork tenderloin that I cut in half and stabbed with a fork so that the juices would soak inside. I used brown sugar instead of white sugar, and added a nice squeeze of maple syrup. I cut up about 4 celery stalks and about 4 carrots and threw them in the crockpot around the pork. I made horseradish mashed potatoes and topped them with the pork and veggies. We ate this 2 nights in a row it was so good! It turned out like a pork stew...this meal was delicious, especially on a cold, winter night.

I made this recipe exactly as written and thought it was very good. The pork was moist and fell apart as we took it out of the crock pot, and the veggies (I used potatoes, an onion, and baby carrots) had great flavor after cooking in the broth all day. Good, solid four.

I will definitely make this again. I used a 3 lb roast and made knife slits and fork punctures and used a large spoon to occasionally pour the liquid over. I also flipped the roast midway. I made the recipe as is and used the leftover broth to make a gravy. I made carrots and mashed potatoes on the stovetop and put the gravy over the roast and potatoes. Overall the flavors were amazing and so simple.

Changed a few ingredients to make it Paleo. (Coconut sugar, coconut aminos instead of soy sauce, and apple cider vinegar) It was amazing. Rested the roast then pulled the pork, adding some of the juice back. Placed in the slow cooker again with homemade Paleo BBQ sauce. DELICIOUS.Will definitely make this again - SOON. Thank you for the recipe.

Easy. Served with the pan sauce and mashed potatoes and carrots.  Not especially tangy to me.  Tasted "dry" in texture.  Could that be the vinegar because it was still saucy?  I'd make it again, though, as it was so easy.

So simple and ridiculously easy!  I used a combination of brown & coconut sugars instead of white and it toned down the sweetness. I also added 5-6 "dashes" of hot sauce!  Quite delicious.

I made this on Sunday and was ready for it again by Monday! I Cooked potatoes in the pot with the roast and my wife said they were the best potatoes she has ever eaten. Best 10 minute meal we have had in recent memory.

This is an easy main dish with a good flavor. The first time I made this I kept to the recipe even though I was skeptical about the sugar. It did end up too sweet for our liking.  The second time I only added a tablespoon of the sugar and it ended up much better for us.

Wonderful recipe! Followed exactly as the recipe called for other than adding some red potatoes and carrots. I also spread minced garlic over the pork and pierced it with a knife in several spots so it would absorb the flavors. Will definitely make again. Thank you K.

my families favorite Sunday dinner!  I do double the ingredients though as I like to make gravy with the liquid.

Made this the other night, with a few changes.  I took another reviewers suggestion and used brown sugar, but also wanted it to be tangy, so I used apple juice, instead of water and Apple Cider vinegar instead of Red Wine vinegar.  Very Yummy.  I will make this again!

Delish. Followed some reviews and used brown sugar instead of white sugar,  red wine vinegar,  browned the roast in butter before putting in crockpot, chicken broth instead of water (1 1/2 cups) Loved the zing from the vinegar the most. Used a 5 pound roast but did not change measurements and coooked for 7 hours.

Absolutely the easiest, most flavorful Pork Roast we have ever eaten. I cooked it for six hours, two hours in to the cooking I added baby red potatoes I had cut in half, I threw in 3cups of baby carrots too! Then I made gravy from the leftover juices,Yum! My wife rated my cooking a full 10 points! We are both very impressed. Definitely a keeper in my recipe file! Thanks "K" you made me look soooo good in the kitchen!

Three steps is about my limit - and this fit the bill! Seriously about 10 minutes to get it into the slow cooker. I don't normally like a lot of onions in my meals and figured I'd put in the whole onion, as called for, and toss most of it when it came time to dish up. But the onions turned out to be just as good as the pork. Very sweet and savory.

Made it as is. Family loved it. One of my kids is going through a season of "I don't eat pork," and he even liked it. Goes very well with a French version of scalloped potatoes that one of our French friends made. No leftovers!

I followed the original recipe except that since my pork loin was 4lbs I made 1 1/2 times the liquid recipe.  I cooked it for 6 1/2 hours on  low and my roast was extremely dry.   I think if you're using a pork loin I'd cut way back on the cooking time but next time I make this I'm going to use a boneless pork shoulder which has a lot more fat and is better suited to the crock pot.

I tried to follow the recipe word for word but I replaced red wine vinegar with balsamic vinegar and soy sauce with worsterschire sauce, and used half the called for sugar.... It was just ok, and kind of sweet... Definitely no tang.  However we did add potatoes and those tasted amazing!! The tenderloin was super tender and moist. As suggested I did boil egg noodles but the sauce was just too sweet I couldn't do it. Some reviews said the recipe was bland I wouldn't call it bland the flavor was subtle but the sweetness was very distinct. If you prefer sweet this is the recipe for , if you prefer spicy keep searching... Also the meat shredded so easily pulled pork sandwich for left overs :-)

This pork roast recipe was very simple to put together. I stuck very closely to the recipe and we thought it made a delicious meal.  I used fresh garlic and apple balsamic vinegar instead of wine vinegar. I substituted honey for the sugar as I had some I wanted to finish. I also had about a half a (smallish) jar of applesauce to finish so I added that to the crockpot too.  I doubled the sauce because of the size pork roast I used.  At the end, I added corn starch mixed with water to the juices left; transferred them to a saucepan and let it reduce until it was a nice consistency.  That was really the crowning touch to the roast pork.  Delicious.  I cooked it on high for close to 5 hours.  It was fall-apart tender.  Thank you for sharing this fantastic recipe.

This was a very moist easy pork roast. The tastes were very mellow but it went well with the stuffed potatoes. Will probably make again as it is an easy recipe

Pleasantly surprised!  Per reviews I only changed two things-  used brown sugar and balsamic vinegar.  Put 2 lb frozen pork loin in slow cooker at 10:00 with carrots and potatoes.  Everything was just right at 5:30.

Wonderful and easy.  Did not have ketchup so substituted marinara sauce, no wine vinegar so used red wine.  Very tender and tasty, not at all dry.  Best part...pulled pork sandwiches the next day!

Great slow cooker pork menu. I prepared this roast yesterday and it turned out fantastic. I did add potatoes and carrots and all cooked for about 8 hours. I think 6 hours would work fine but was late getting home. Try it, you will like it. Left overs make for great sandwich. Sid

Apparently there are hundreds of people with different taste buds from my spouse and me. We both TRIED to eat it but found its combined sweetness/sourness vile. The two dogs got a big helping; the rest went into the trash. 

Try this on a small scale before you commit to it.

This was so good! Went to make it and realized I was short a few items, so substituted catsup and red wine vinegar for salsa/catalina dressing and apple cider vinegar. Delish! Perfect sweet/spice/tang mix!

I really, really liked this. I used a 2 1/2 pound pork roast that I sprinkled with salt/pepper and browned on all sides. I didn't have red wine vinegar, so I used white vinegar, but only two tablespoons. I don't eat sugar, so I used Splenda instead and replaced half the ketchup with sriracha hot sauce (I love spicy). Halfway through cooking time, I added four cups of shredded cabbage. It's was my whole dinner with a side salad. Pork fell apart. I will definitely make this again, but add a little less Splenda...it's my fault I added too much. I'm sure next time it will be five stars! Wonderful...thanks for sharing :)

I used siracha for the hot sauce and halved the sugar (I always cut the sugar in half, even in desert recipes)  I threw in some peeled, quartered potatoes for simplicity at dinnertime. The sauce was delicious and did not suffer from less sugar - in fact I think more sugar would have been too sweet! The potatoes absorbed the flavor and we had a nice gravy for the pork. Made some zucchini for a side. I will make this again.  Thanks for a easy flavorful pork recipe!

This was not good. I used a pork loin and followed the recipe exactly. It was dry and bland. It was so disappointing after smelling it cook all day. My 6 year old wouldn't even eat it.

The BEST I have ever made. Placed the rest of the onions on top, added 6 cloves of chopped garlic and did it on high for 4 hours, as it was so large I had to cut it in half to get it in there. The house smelled heavenly, the juice I thickened for gravy and the onions were caramelized and lovely sitting in a bowl next to it. Got raves from family

This was really good and super easy, which I love! My roast was actually about 3 lbs. and cooked all day on high. It was moist and pulled apart easy. I added red potatoes and carrots. Will make again. Thanks for the recipe.

We really loved this.  I only changed a few things, which shouldn't have altered the flavor much.  I didn't have an onion, so I used dried diced onion.  Instead of sugar, I used Truvia Baking Blend (which is half sugar & half Truvia - used 1/2 the amount as recommended on the bag) just to make it a little healther.  I put some oil in a pan & seared both sides of my pork (no idea what cut of pork I used, but it turned out way more awesome than I thought it would).  I pulled that out of the pan, then put all of the ingredients in, mixed it & let it warm, then added the pork back in.  I had some baby carrots & potatoes to use up, so I put those in as well (diced the potatoes).  I didn't have time to slow cook it, so I just put a lid on & simmered for about an hour.  We will definitely be making this again.  My only complaint is that I didn't have enough sauce.  I will probably double next time, so I have more to use as a gravy for the veggies.

My roast was slightly more than 4 lbs, so I doubled everything except the water (1.5 c) and the sugar, which I reduced to 2 tablespoons.  After cooking, I removed the liquid from the crockpot and added a cornstarch slurry (4 tablespoons in 1 cup cold water) and thickened the sauce.  Once thickened, I mixed with the shredded pork and let sit in the crockpot on warm for 1 hour to allow the flavors to meld.  I gave this a 5 but my family only kind of liked it (they're not big pork fans).

Very good! Like the sweetness of the sauce - not overly sweet with a hint of tang. The roast turned out so tender and moist. Great flavours with minimal ingredients - my kind of recipe! Thank you for sharing this!

Excellent way to cook pork, my husband asked when i was going to make it again...that really means he likes it!  I will cut the sugar a little next time.

Added a little bit of Sprite also. Made the veggies (carrots and potatoes) tangy. Needs the full 4 hours. Potatoes were still a little crunchy at 3 and half hours

This is one of my families favorite recipes. We eat it at least once a month. It is super easy to make and I almost always have all the ingredients on hand. If I don't have onions I substitute onion flakes and it still tastes great.

With a few tweeks, this recipe is a real winner.  I followed all the directions as is, except subbing beef broth for the water, however, at the end of the cook time the pork was rather white and bland looking, so I added some worcestershire sauce, let that cook for a little bit, then removed the pork and added (combined prior to adding, in a separate bowl) 2 tbsp of cornstarch and 1/4 cup water to thicken the sauce, then added the pork back in. Super delish!

The whole family LOVED it but they all also agree that it should not have sugar in it next time.  If it wasn't sweet and only had the tang, it would have been perfect.

I added extra spices, as recommended by several other reviewers.  I was really nervous while it was cooking because the smell of onion was overwhelming (so much so that I was certain this meal was going to be terrible), but it tasted great!  No overwhelming onion taste at all. My husband, who is terribly picky, said that this was a meal he could eat once a week!  You can easily eat it as is, or add barbeque sauce.  This will become a frequent meal in my house!

Some reviewers said they found it bland. I didn't find this at all. I served it over rice.

I wanted to like this, the pork was bland, because the onions kept the meat out of the sauce while it cooked. But we didn't care for the flavor of the sauce, either.

We tried adding BBQ sauce on the shredded meat the next day and it still didn't hide the flavor. Maybe we don't like white sugar on pork.

Used anaheim peppers and cooked on low for around 5-6 hours. Used a little extra brown sugar and it made it sweet, would also be good if it was spicier.

I made this exactly with only one minor change... I did not have an onion so I used about a tablespoon of onion soup mix. Used all other ingredients as listed. My daughter couldn't get enough and my boyfriend said, after the 3rd day, this was the best pork roast he's ever eaten. That right there is a 5 star review!

I pretty much tripled the seasonings and added carrots and potatoes like one reviewer suggested. The veggies were great but the pork was so dry, I could hardly eat it. I don't know what to do to prevent that. It was really bad.

I've done this several times, the last few with pork tenderloin.  I always add four or five onions because the guys in my family are big fans. They especially like to shred this and use in pulled pork sandwiches.  Excellent flavour. Will definitely keep making this.

Delicious and SO easy to make.  I just added a little more hot pepper sauce because we like our food spicy.  I serve it with white rice and our choice of veggies on the side.

I omitted the sugar and added a capful (maybe a tsp?) of maple syrup instead. I also added mushrooms with the onions, and used thick pork loin chops instead of one roast. Delicious, will definitely make this again!!

This is excellent, and so easy! I realized I was out of soy sauce so used Worcestershire. The juice is delicious, and don't skimp on the onion asit isdelicious served with meat. Served with vegetables and applesauce.

I did not like this pork roast.  I used apple cider vinegar instead of red wine vinegar because that's what I had and maybe that was the reason.  Thanks anyway!

I really liked this recipe! I used a pork butt roast, ant it was so moist, that the bone fell off while it was cooking. When I made it, I added baby carrots and whole canned potatoes. The carrots made the roast taste VERY sweet, so next time I make it, I won't add as much sugar. Super easy and great to make!

Wanted something quick and easy for the crockpot and sick of bbq.  Left out the onion since my daughter doesn't like them.  No red wine vinegar so used Tastefully Simple Merlot Sauce and the Frank's Sweet Chili Hot Sauce (a few dashes!).  Roast was melt in your mouth delicious!  Added the buttered egg noodles and spinich and wha-lah!  A great, quick meal.  The remainder I threw together and added sour cream with some of the juice from the crockpot for a stroganoff left over for lunches.

When I need to tweak a recipe as much as I needed to tweak this one, then it is no longer really the same recipe. If made as is it is edible, but certainly not special.

This wasn't bad, I just don't think the pork had a lot of taste. It was very tender - basically fell apart when I took it out of the crock pot. Maybe, as others suggested, I just need to increase the amount of the flavorful ingredients?

I found the roast to be just tangy enough.  I thought the overall flavor was very good.  I only wished it had more of a gravy to put on the noodles.

I did not care for this recipe. I used other reviewers suggestions and increased the seasoning and decreased the liquid.  I also added whole baby carrots into the slow cooker. About 3 hours in, I was afraid to serve this.  6 hours in (on low) I took out the pork and shredded it. I then doused the pork in bbq sauce and had to add 2 heaping teaspoons of flour into the broth to make a nice gravy.  I added the pork back in...along with a half a bag of frozen corn.  I basically created an entire NEW dish to salvage this one.  Instead of 'set it and forget it'...I was worried about this dish the entire time...and for good reason.

I think you'll find the dish more flavorful if you make the following substitutions:

Use dark brown Muscovado sugar instead of white sugar.

Use plain tomato paste instead of ketchup.

Use Worcestershire sauce instead of soy.

Use granulated garlic instead of garlic powder.

I'd toss in some finely chopped onion, too, plus a bit of basil to liven the tomato flavor.  (Use dried onion flakes if you need to absorb more moisture.)

This recipe was amazing!  I adjusted it for 4 servings instead of 8 and used 1 TBSP of scotch bonnet pepper sauce. The meat was so tender and there was just enough liquid leftover to pour on top of the pork.  I will definitely be making this a lot!

This recipe was good, but I dont think that it had as much flavor as i would have liked.  The pork was super moist and tasted good, I just like a little more pizazz in my food, it was a little bit bland for my taste.  Shredded the leftovers and made bbq pork... that was yummy :)

I thought it was very yummy, and couldn't be easier! Next time I would do less sweet and more tang, as it was quite sweet. But, the pork tasted great at dinner tonight and I am looking forward to leftovers! I will definitely make it again.

This was really good!!  It was so tender and flavorful.  I doubled the pepper and the garlic powder.  Next time I think I will use 1.5 onions b/c they were delicious after being cooked in the juices!

Very good. I followed the recipe as closely as possible. I used 3 cloves of garlic (crushed), dark brown sugar and did not use my crock pot.  I browned the roast in a dutch oven, browned the onions, and then added the ingredients to it. It cooked for 2 hours covered on low, then I cut it into  4 pieces and cooked another 1/2 hour uncovered. The sauce wasn't thick but it was flavorful. I shredded the leftovers and we had sandwiches the next day. Will make again!

Unfortunately this was very bland, I followed the recipe to a 'T', the roast was done nicely, but so dull, a weak, slightly sweet taste to the sauce. I did everything right.  I feel like I wasted a nice pork roast.  I'm determined to doctor up the sauce, it was so mediocre.

this was a very good dish.  Bet it would be good also if one added a beef roast with the pork roast. Two nights later I warmed some of the pork and gravy and served it as a hot sandwich.

This was good, but had no discernible flavor other than crockpot pork.  I served it over egg noodles as suggested.  If I make it again, I will probably choose rice.

I was not let down by this recipe at all.  It doesn't actually say that there should be a sauce in the end, so cook it as directed and don't try to use the watery leftovers for sauce if you don't want to!  The pork was perfect and I had some cranberry chutney with it.  I added potatoes and carrots and did not like them at all, I will not do that next time.

This pork roast was amazing.  I used cooking sherry instead of the wine - as I had no wine on hand.  I cooked it all day.  I was worried the sauce would be too thin - but actually - though thin - it was like an au jus.  We ate this for 3 days and it only got better.

My boyfriend and I found this to be a moist and flavorful dish.  I added carrots and red potatoes for flavor and vegetable variety.  The flavor was sweeter than I would have liked, but that just means tweaking the recipe!  I would definitely recommend as we were both pleased.

This is a good, solid recipe. It doesn't "wow" me, so I'm giving it a 4-star rating, but it is on our menu about once a month...

I love this recipe I thought the ingredents didn't make sence but it was very good the only thing I would add is either dried cranberry's or plumagrante seeds. Would be delish!

yumm, yummy!!! This pork was so easy to make and was so tender and delicous. I put it together and threw it in the crockpot right before work. I got home to an incredible smell and a dinner I could be proud of. This is going on the menu atleast once a month.

Delicious roast, and very easy, but one thing didn't work out so well. I actually baked this in the oven instead of the slow cooker due to timing issues, and I found the sauce to be a little more watery than I wanted, so next time I will half the water, since there are plenty more liquids that can take the place of the water, and then it will also stick to the roast more like a glze, instead of sliding off and becoming a soup at the bottom.

This was tender, juicy we used it for enchilada and sandwich filling as well as all by itself.  I will agree with some others that the spices needed doubling but really the meat was so flavorful in itself too much spice might detract from the wonderful pork itself.  That said, the title of the dish is "tangy" and we didn't notice any tang:0) Thank you for sharing.

Not that unique or really all that tangy, but it was an easy way to cook up a pork roast, and the onions were delicious!  We will make this again.

I would give this more than 5 stars if possible!!! I got it from this site a couple years ago and have made it many times. I love it and so does everyone else. It is so good, I don't even look for pork roast recipes anymore - I have already found the perfect one. I make it exactly as written, except leave out the hot sauce since I don't like very spicy foods. PERFECT!

My husband and I both LOVED this recipe!  I did make a couple of changed due to what I had on hand.  I did not have any red wine vinegar so I used rice vinegar, 1/2 cup water (instead of full cup) and 1/2 cup red wine.  I also supplemented minced garlic for the garlic powder.  I put onions, carrots and celery on the bottom.  We loved it!  This will definitely become a staple in my household.  Thanks so much for sharing!

This is such a wonderful recipe.  I only had boneless centercut pork chops - put them in the crock pot completely frozen (it warms it up slowly rather than on high heat which "siezes" the meat and makes it tough.), and the fat on the meat melts away and back into the crock which only makes the meat more tender.  And I didn't have red wine vinegar - I only had balsamic vinegar - WOW and YUM.  So flavorful - Cooked on high for 6 hours - rich deep brown color.  Those were the only changes I made.  I made this for lunch today after church, and we gobbled it ALL up, so I'm making my second batch right now for dinner.  Put it over mashed potatoes and opened up some frozen corn - really delicious dinner - you will NOT be sorry you chose this recipe, for sure!

Very good and very easy.  The pork pulled apart easily with a fork.  Reminded me of pork barbeque I've had in the south.

This was good and easy. It's definitely a recipe to keep on hand for days when I need to throw something together quickly. I used chicken broth instead of water plus put salt, pepper, and oregano on the pork for extra flavor. I also put carrots on the bottom of the crock pot. They were really yummy, and I think that the pork cooks better when it's not submerged in liquid.

Me and the kids really liked this, but am only giving it 4 stars because my husband just thought it was okay.  I would say, however, that we bought thought it was better than those flavored pork loins you can buy.  The only change I made was to add some pepper flakes and cayenne pepper in place of the hot sauce.  Oh, I did brown the pork loin in olive oil/garlic before adding it to the crockpot, where it cooked on low for 7 hours.

Really, really good.  I've been trying a number of different pork recipes lately, and my husband said this was the best one yet. I substituted red pepper flakes and a dash of cayenne powder for the hot sauce, but otherwise followed as written , just adjusting quantities for a smaller roast using the calculator.   Had it for shredded pork sandwiches one night, and pork quesidillas another.

My husband made this.  He followed the recipe exactly.  The result was a very sweet liquid, too sweet for us and lacking any real punch. The meat was wonderfully tender.  I'd try another recipe next time or cut back on the sugar greatly and add a bit of spice, chili, cumin maybe or maybe garlic.

This is exceptionally easy and delicious! I mix up the sauce the night before and toss it over the pork roast and onions in the morning and let it cook all day. The onions carmelize and pork just falls apart. Great for serving with rice or pasta or shred the pork and make fantastic burritos or hot sandwiches!

Incredible recipe. Extremely easy to make and one of our all time favorites on this site. The sauce is so delish, I usually double it. The only changes I make is doubling the garlic (we love garlic!) and add a couple pinches of ginger.  We make this at least once a month, the leftovers (if you have any) make really great sandwiches the next day too, especially if you use a good crusty bread.

This is a easy and delicious recipe. I did it in the slow cooker and my husband loved it. Instead of garlic powder I added two cloves of garlic other than that used all the same ingredients. Will sure be having this is a regular meal through the cold winter months!

YUM!! I love the flavor that the soy, vinegar and ketchup gives. I skip the hot sauce because I do not like hot. I add more onions and then add potatos and carrots. I just made this again for the second time. I let it cook for probably 12 hours and the meat had fallen off of the bone all by itself. My kids and hubby love it. Defintely a keeper and a nice change to the traditional flavors of a pork roast.

I am not a huge fan of pork roast but this was very good!  It was easy to put together and I used a teriakyi sauce instead of the soy sauce.  I served it with mashed potatoes and steamed brocoli and califlower.  It was good enough that even the leftovers got eaten!

I had a 1.88 pound boneless Boston Butt roast which I cooked in my crock pot for about 8 hours on low.  I used the original recipe as is except added a little more Tabasco sauce.  I also used a large white onion.  This turned out to be a very tasty, not too spicy pork roast with a very pleasant pork flavor.  Thank you K.

Wow this was amazing!  I doubled the spices and added some potatos, carrots and celery about 3 hours into cooking.  I also cut into slices 3 hours into the cooking as well to have it soak up the flavor.  Will make again soon!

This came out wonderful! I used a 3 lbs bone-in sirloin roast. I took the advice of some of previous reviews and tripled the recipe (except for the sugar and water, I cut the water in half). I also added about a tbsp of minced garlic, used apple cider vinegar in lieu of red and used brown sugar in lieu of the white. I marinated the roast over night and only added the water to the mix right before cooking and pouring it over the roast in the crockpot. I cooked it on low for 8 hours (precaution because it was bone-in). It turned out so tender it fell of the bone as we were serving it out of the crockpot! The juice was a perfect finishing touch to drizzle over the meat.  A definate keeper!!!

Excellent dish.  Only thing I would change is cutting the water in half.  It would help thicken up the sauce and the loin produces plenty on its own.    Definitely plan on making again.

It came out awesome! I doubled the ingredients to make more of a sauce and used fresh garlic instead of powdered. I was worried from other reviews that it would come out dry so I basted a couple of times and flipped the roast over half way through cooking. It came out super moist and tender! I added cornstarch in a 1/2 cup of water and made a gravy with the leftover sauce. I made mashed potatoes as a side and poured the gravy over the top. The sauce came out very strong and spicy - we loved it but not for everyone.

This was wonderful!  I took the advise of others and made more sauce - actually three times the recipe.  I added red potatoes and baby carrots and more red pepper sauce and I used pork shoulder.  The next day my wonderful boyfriend made soft tacos with it.  It was amazing!!

I can't believe it has taken me this long to review this recipe!! I have made it at least 15 times in the last year as it is in our regular dinner roation and is also good enough(not to mention easy)for company!!  I always double the sauce since my hubby LOVES it and the kids tolerate it..that's enough for me!

I do not usually modify recipes but due to the overwhelming amount of recomendations to season the heck out of this i did. I cut slits in the roast (about 5 total) and stuffed in whole cloves of garlic (peeled of course) and this really gave it good flavor. It was tender and the additional spices by the writer were a great combo! thanks!

I am always looking for easy slow cooker recipes since I am a single mom of two working full time slow cooking allows me to make dinner faster.  This was excellent.  The pork was juicy and fell right apart.  I prepped everything in the morning put my crock pot bowl in the fridge then had my 15 year old son put the bowl in the crock pot about 4 hours before I would get home from work. The presto it was done right on time for dinner.  Will definately make again and again.

Very easy to make. I used a picnic pork, because that is what I had on hand. The onions were the best part.

This was such an easy roast to make and it tastes great!  I shredded it and put the Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce on it to make a pulled pork sandwich!  FABULOUS!

Used a 4.5 lb boneless loin cut into three pieces and rubbed with cajun spices, browned and followed the rest of the directions. Decided I wanted to make pulled pork so I cooked it another couple of hours on low. Kept the juices, pulled the pork with two forks made a sandwich with BBQ sauce I get from Georgia (Williamson Brothers). Had a side of my Homemade Slaw. DELICIOUS. Thanks. Serving rest at party today.

This is super easy and awesome tasting.  No changes needed at all!  I normally cook on high for 3 hours, then turn to low for the rest of the time.  Thanks for posting! This has become a regular in our rotation.

I wasn't that impressed with this. You could barely taste the tangy-ness. I do have to say that the pork was tender, but didn't have much flavour at all. I put potatoes in the bottom b/c i didn't have any onion, but everything else i followed. The potatoes had more flavour then the meat.

This recipe is awesome! I used two pork tenderloins, increased most of the seasonings, added fresh minced garlic...and put in the crock pot on high for 3.5 hours. The meat was fork tender! I also made some bbq sauce (from another recipe on this site) and drizzled it over the top of the sliced pork. Yummmm!

Only altered the garlic powder to a Tbsp. of minced garlic. This was outstanding! Not sure where the other's described it as too sweet? It was flavored perfectly. Since the meat fell apart (so tender!)we just put it on rolls, then used the broth as an au jus dipping sauce. So yummy! This will go as a fav in the house. My 5 year old kept asking me "Can I have more of THAT MEAT mom?"

Another five stars - I made it just as the recipe called for, with one exception: I was out of red wine vinegar so I just used white. The taste was wonderful, the texture was wonderful, the roast pulled apart by fork, and the "sauce" at the bottom of the cooker (once I siphoned off the fat) was so savory and delicious that I've saved the whole thing to make a stew later. Thanks for this wonderful recipe.

OMG, This was sooooooo good. I used Vidalia onion and I didn't have any red wine vinegar so I used cider vinegar instead and I omitted the hot sauce. My kids & I loved it. Hubby added the hot sauce to his own & he was happy too. I don't normally like any roast cooked in the crock pot but this was really good. So now this is the only way I will cook my pork roasts.

This was good. In the interest of time, I only cooked for 2 1/2 hrs on high. It was alittle dry but I made gravy out of the liquid and served with mashed potatoes. It was sweet and tangy. I used slightly less sugar and salt because my soy sauce was not low in sodium. Next time I will put potatoes and carrrots in. The onions were delicious.

This made a pretty okay pork loin. It was definitely tender but a little dry. I poked holes in the meat with a fork, but that still didn't help the sauce penetrate. The outer edges that cooked in the sauce were tasty, but the interior was bland. I ended up pouring some of the sauce in ramekins and dipping each bite, which helped with the dryness and added some flavor to the inside of the pork loin.

Quite tasty.  I had a 4 lb roast, so I doubled the other ingredients, and the flavor was decent.  I probably could have tripled the sauce and it would have tasted better.

Absolutely wonderful!  I didn't change a thing...although I did use a pork butt instead of a loin.  I put it over egg noodles the first night and then put it on hoagie rolls the next.

This recipe was really good.  I already had all of the ingredients on hand and it was really fast to assemble.  I loved the taste of the juice in the crock pot.  I did as some other reviewers and browned the meat first and I also poked holes in the roast so the flavor would penetrate.  Next time I might marinate it overnight.  I'll make this one again.

This is one winner of a recipe!!! After a really hectic day and a quick search, I sure am glad I tried this one. My only changes were I omitted the salt & black pepper as well as the hot sauce (which I didn't have on hand) and added garlic-pepper and a dash of chili pepper Put it all in the slow cooker and YUM!!! My pork roast was 2.68 lbs and it was actually done in about 4 hrs on low....but I let it go 6 hrs. It was so juicy and tender. It actually fell apart trying to get it out of the crock. :)

Wonderful, easy recipe.  Pork was not bland, but full of flavor!  I doubled the recipe, everything, including say sauce, vinegar, ketchup and spices.  In addition, I added carrots (which were delicious) and next time I will add potatoes and celery (I had none at the time.)  Delicious recipe.  Even the 5 year old loved it!

I made this recipes almost exactly as shown except I used brown suagr instead of white sugar and minced fresh garlic instead of garlic powder. It came out very moist and very flavorful. My husband really liked it and I received no complaints from my kids. I will certainly use this recipe again.

I have made many roasts and I gave up because all of mine were dry and bland. I thought to myself "one more time." I am glad I gave it a try with this recipe. I added carrots and yellow potatoes to this recipe and it was DELICIOUS!

The flavor is something I've never had with a pork roast. It was tangy/sweet, but unique. I admit, I didn't 100% follow the recipe. I doubled everything. I used hoisin sauce instead of ketchup and balsamic vinaigrette instead of the vinegar. I also used a tablespoon of bbq sauce. I lined the side of the croc pot with sliced potatoes and cut the roast into 4 pieces. I used a knife and slit deep holes into the raw meat and stuffed some garlic into them. I seasoned the pork with season all and paprika. I also added 2 cubes of H2O + chicken boullion instead of water.  Again, I'd give it a higher rating, but I changed a lot. this is my first time making a pot roast, so I was expecting a different flavor than my mom's traditional one. I enjoyed it and will make it again. :)

This was GREAT!  I doubled the marinade (as some suggested), used fresh garlic, and added potatos, celery, carrots, and more onion.  I served it over jasmine rice - AWESOME and so were the leftovers!

This recipe is so good.  Even the kids love it.  I wouldn't change anything about it.  The juice is delicious.  I even used Splenda instead of sugar and it still turned out great.

Pretty good recipe--one note that might help others: I used a pork roast (as the recipe called for), not a butt (shoulder) roast so there was not a lot of fat.  To intinsify the flavor (others complained of blandness) and increase the moisture content in the final product I removed the pork after cooking, trimmed the fat and shredded it with 2 forks (not too small) strained what was left in the crock pot, returned the shredded pork back to the crock pot with the strained marinade and let it cook another hour--then served it over sticky rice. Flavorful, moist, excellent.  I varied from the recipe only two small ways: (1) used  4 roughly chopped cloves of fresh garlic instead of the garlic powder and (2) used 10 dashes of hot sauce (although next time I will use more).  We will definitly make it again!

I love trying new things on allrecipes, and this one took it right out of the ball park! I followed the recipe EXACTLY as it said. The only thing extra that I did that wasn't specified, I pre-prepared it the night before, so when I went to work the next day I could just throw it on the crock before I left. So it soaked all night long. This is definetly a keeper!

This was great.  The only change I made was to substitute teriyaki sauce as I was out of soy sauce.  DH said to stick with the teriyaki as it tasted great as it was.  Served with new red potatos and roasted garlic cauliflower also from this site. (Which was also great.)

Im not a big pork eater but this is really good.  I used the recipe as a basis really.  I took 3 lbs pork loin, cut into 6 pieces and browned in pan first.  Then put pork in slow cooker and started dumping the mixture, but i added teriaki sauce and bottled barbeque sauce on top of the ingredients listed in larger quantities.  About 5 hours on low i shredded the pork and kept cooking.  By the time it was done, all the juice had absorbed into the shredded pork and made some awesome sandwiches.  Its so easy too!

How could anyone say this was bland? That is beyond me. I made this today, using a 3 pound bone-in pork roast. The meat fell right off the bone. Cooked it in the crockpot for 8 hours on low..wow! It almost tastes like a saurbraten gravy, the onions are awesome. I thickened the gravy with flour/water, and place the meat back in the gravy. Going to serve it with mashed potatoes. I figured after seeing 513 reviews, most of them being positive this was the one to make. Definatly going to make again. Now, I'm going to pass this one on to my brother, he loves to cook, and will appreciate this recipe.

I really wanted to love this but I didn't.  I used cider vinegar because that's what I had on hand.  I didn't care for the vinegar flavor, however, the meat was so tender and just fell apart which was great.  Ended up draining this sauce and making a gravy to serve with it.  Thanks anyway.

With almost 500 ratings and a 4.5 star
average, I got lazy and didn't bother to
read the reviews.  My bad.  This seems to
be one of those "love it or hate it"
recipes.  Unfortunately, I'm not on the
love list.  Made it exactly by the recipe. (Printed it out and had it 
sitting on the kitchen counter top.)
It was quite tender. Just did not like
the taste at all.

SOOO GOOD! I first browned the roast in a skillet and then doubled the ingredients. Cooked it in the slow cooker for 9 hours and the meat literally fell apart when I tried to plate it. The tang is delicious and a perfect combination with pork.

This was okay, but I was slightly disappointed considering all the fuss from so many other reviewers.  The liquid was really watery, the roast was not super tender, the flavor was not spectacular.  We ate it, but probably wouldn't make it again.

We liked this fairly well, although no one was clammoring for seconds.  The sauce made a nice, flavorful gravy after I thickened it with some flour, and it required no additional seasoning.  The meat was very tender, and the recipe was quite easy and convenient.***I'm changing my rating from 4 to 5 stars after making this a second time.  I only did a couple of things differently, but this time it was delicious.  I had no onion, so I placed the roast on a bed of sliced apples instead.  Also, I pierced the roast before pouring on the sauce.  I don't know why it was so much better, but it was.

We had this tonight and thought it was great.  We really liked the flavor and it was different than what we normally do with pork.  I accidentally left our roast on "keep warm" for 5 hours and had to dump it out.  I ended up just using a couple pounds of pork chops and cooking it on high for the 3 hours I had left until we were having friends over!  I added cut up red potatoes and carrots.

I followed this recipe to the letter and found the taste to be quite strange.  No one really liked it and I have tons of leftovers.  And this is from a serious pork eating family -- don't plan on making this again.

This had a good flavor.  Did seem a little dry.  Perhaps a loin is not the best cut.

Really great and easy pork roast.  Did it in the oven at 225 deg; there was lots of juice left to make an awesome gravy with.

Outstanding recipe!  I add potatoes and carrots as other suggested, and have also done it with pork pieces instead of a full roast.  Since I don't usually have red wine vinegar, I use red wine and apple cider vinegar.

Very tasty!  I added a little extra soy, minced garlic, and extra salt and pepper.  I cooked it on high for 2 hours, and then low for 5 hours.  It melted in our mouths.  My husband really liked it!  We will make this one again.
Thanks for the recipe!

Wow!!!!  I put all this in the crock pot on Sunday morning before church and walked in hours later to the incredible aroma from this dish!!!  Not only did it smell fantastic, but it tasted to-die-for, too!!!  I made it exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing!!

My entire family LOVED this (even my 2 year old!!) and we will definitely be having this again!

So, so good!  My husband absolutely loved this.  The flavor was so tasty.  I served it with some steamed veggies and quinoa; it was a perfect meal!  I bet this would be good as a shredded pork sandwich too.  I will have to try that next.  Thanks for the amazing recipe.

I've cooked this for just the two of us and also for special occasions and it received  rave reviews each time.  In fact, I just made it again today.  Sometimes I save and freeze the liquid and reuse it.

This was very good. I did add some peeled chunks of potatoes which browned up nice and went well with the sauce. It goes into my recipe box.

Tasty, but not overpowering - just what I was looking for to doctor up the porketta roast I had a bit.  Plus it was so easy to get together & w/ the cost of food today, I liked not having to buy a ton of extra ingredients - I had everything on the recipe!  Only change I made was I doubled the recipe since I had a 4.5lb roast.

This recipe was very good. I did however use chicken breasts instead of pork roast.  As other reviewer suggested I also doubled the sauce (except the sugar),and thickened it with corn starch. I served it over rice. Will definitely make again!

This sounded really tasty, but it turned out dry for me.  I even used beef broth instead of water, but did everything else the same.  It smelled good cooking, but I probably won't make again.

Doubled everything but the sugar, next time I will also not double the water. Cooked a 4 and 1/2 lb boneless pork loin on high 1 hour, low @ 3 hours (to internal temp of 150 degrees) and then turned to warm for @ 2 hours.  Sliced very nicely and was tender and juicy.

Tender,tasty roast.  The onions make it so good.  I added baby carrots and wished that I had cut down (or cut out the sugar) because they added so much sweetness to what is already a sweet sauce.  Used juice in crockpot for gravy on stove. Thickened with flour and added a dab of sour cream.

This was an exceptionally easy and quick recipe that gives great flavor.  I threw in some potatoes and green beans.  Next time I'll add carrots and celery as well.  The meat still needed a little kick, so we used horseradish as a dipping sauce.

I added potatoes (cut in fourths), a couple handfuls of baby carrots, and 2 whole onions (cut like onion rings).  I let it cook for about 8.5 hours and the meat was tender and tasteful.  My husband loved it and we dumped it all on top of white rice.  The juice that the recipes makes as the "marinade" was really good on the rice.

This was just ok for me. I doubled the ingredients except for the sugar as others suggested but it was still too sweet.This has potenial though. I'll try it again with less water and even less sugar.

Definatly an ok recipe.  But did not have the flavorful punch I was imagining.  I did double the ingrediants except for the sugar.  I might make again but will decrease the water, give it more kick.  The roast was definatly tender though.  As with all slow cookers do not cook to long. I'm giving it a four because I can tell that it has great potential to really zip.  And who knows I may have got side tracked with the other meals I was preparing and dosed it with too much water myself.  (But I don't think so.)  Definatly great potential of a solid 5.

WOW!  My pork loin came out so tender and juicy, I don't think I'll ever cook it any other way.  Because I was out of red wine vinegar I used white distilled vinegar and it tasted great.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly as it's listed.  I'll definately make this one again, maybe next time with a larger cut of meat so I can have more leftovers!

We had this last night, almost! I have a large crockpot so we used a 7lb bone-in pork roast, two onions sliced on the bottom of the pot, then the roast, then we stuffed quartered potatoes in the side gaps, fresh ground pepper on the meat, and because I was talking non-cooking hubby through it over the phone from work, had him pour in 1/2 c water then 1 1/2 bottles of bbq sauce poured all over, cooked on low 8 hours, served with soft rolls and some asparagus on the side. It was very moist, tender, just fell apart and made the best sandwiches. There's plenty of leftovers for lunch today. Hubby and 6year old son both loved it and hubby was so proud of his cooking accomplishment! Will try your sauce next time I'm cooking :)

This gave the pork good texture and flavor, but my added veggies didn't soften up after 8hrs on low, which made the meal somewhat unappetizing.

Another winning recipe from allrecipes.com!  This took me about five minutes to throw together and my slow cooker had my nearly three pound pork roast ready in less than two hours.  The onions were awesome, as was the flavor of the juice.  A packet of onion soup might make for an interesting touch next time.  I had dressing as a side.  The juice made for an awesome garnish.

ADDENDUM: We used this recipe again tonight, using the rub designed for another allrecipes family favorite, "Garlic Prime Rib." We also rested the meat on a bed of two cans of sauerkraut. This is a purple ribbon meal!

Make it even easier by substituting half a bag of frozen pearl onions for the sliced onion. Also, I substitued brown sugar for white and boiled the sauce with onions down in a small saucepan after the pork was done. It made a delicious gravy.

This was excellent.  I also used chicken broth instead of water and reduced the amount of sugar by one tablespoon.  I mixed about half a cup of the sauce with some flour to thicken it.  Can't wait to eat the leftovers.

I loved this recipe!  The pork was tender and juicy, and the sauce was tangy and flavorful.  The onions were amazing!  My husband liked the pork, and the sauce, but not together (he is more of a pork purist).  I'm going to split the difference with 4 stars.

Don't really know what all the hype was with this one.  I definitely will NOT be making this one again.  I followed the recipe to a "T" with the exception of adding chicken broth instead of water.  This one was a real disappointment!

I just made this tonight it came out great! I used thick center cut pork chops instead of a roast and cooked on low between 200-250 for 6 or 7 hours in my nesco. I also subbed balsamic for red wine, and doubled up on all the ingredients to make extra sauce. Went great with mashed potatoes and green beans. The sauce is a little thin, but it didn't matter much we still enjoyed it. I will make this one again and again, quick and easy!

This recipe is the best recipe off this website to date.  It is so super easy to make and it tastes so good.  My husband absolutely loved it too.  The sauce is good on rice or potatoes.  The only bad thing about it is that it's hard not to overeat it.  :)

I used a Boston Butt for this recipe and it came out nicely.  I cut back on the water, added more hot sauce, onion and garlic and let it cook for 9 hours. The meat fell off the fork.  I removed the roast and degreased the sauce, as  there was a lot of it.  Poured the sauce in a pan and thickened with cornstarch, per another reviewer. Nice flavor and unlike pouring BBQ sauce over the meat. Will definitely make again.

This dish will definitely go in our dinner rotation--my husband loved it. I thought the sauce was too thin though.  I ended up pouring most of it into a pan at the end and adding cornstarch to thicken, then spooned over the pork when I served it.  Maybe next time I'll cut back on the water.

This is an awesome way to cook pork. I used a center cut roast and I didn't have any vinegar so I used red wine vinegrette salad dressing and it still came out perfect. Everyone loved it, I will be making again. thanks for the great recipe!

This is a good, easy meal.  Good flavor, although not as "tangy" as I expected.  I was in a hurry this morning and it took only 10 minutes to throw together.  Like some of the other reviewers, I used chicken broth (low-sodium) instead of water.  I also used low-sodium soy sauce and didn't realize I was out of red wine vinegar so I used balsamic.  I added almost a pound of baby carrots to the crockpot and those were wonderful.  Served with brown rice.

I liked the flavor that came out of this.  Watch your cooking times-my roast was a little smaller and was a little dry, but still tender.  I used a "heaping" tbsp of ketchup and omitted the salt since I feel soy sauce is salty enough.  I also reduced the sauce with some cornstarch and served it all with rice and teriyaki veggies!  I will make it again with a closer eye on the cooking time!

This recipe was delicious!!  The only changes I made were to use chicken broth instead of water and I used apple cider vinegar in place of the red wine vinegar that I was out of.  I will definitely be making this again for my family and will be passing the recipe along to friends.

This was GREAT!  I followed the recipe to a T, and it turned out perfectly.  I served it over white rice, and the thinner sauce was perfect for it.  I also served some asparagus on the side.
Thanks for the recipe - I'll be passing this one on to my family and friends!

I found this to be just OK...nothing spectacular. I did as suggested and used a can of chicken broth instead of water but I found it to be a bit "soupy/watery". On the upside...the roast was very tender...fell apart trying to take it out of the crockpot.

This was a huge hit with my family.  I used pork leg (skin removed of 2.1 lb (nearly 1 Kg) and it fed 4 greedy people, served with mashed potato.  Seeing comments about a thin sauce, I used 2 onions, which added to the texture.  I cooked for 4.5 hours on low-medium and it was not dry at all.  Shall be doing this one again!

Delicious! Like others, I removed gravy to sauce pan and added cornstarch to thicken the gravy. Very easy to make! Will definitely add this dish to my "favs!"

Very flavorful. I did not add salt and increased the hot pepper sauce to 5 drops. Not at all spicy and next time may add more hot pepper sauce. I reduced the juice to serve with the roast and noodles.

This was perfect exactly how the recipe stated. The only thing I did different was cook the pork loin (I used chops, not roast) on low for about 6 hours and it was so so tender. I don't use ketchup,ever, so I substituted teriyaki sauce and it was perfect.

One word - YUMMY!  Even my picky husband gave this one rave reviews.  I followed the recipe as written except I used a pork shoulder roast (bone-in) and cooked about 8 hrs. on LOW.  Very tender & tasty.  Added cornstarch at the end to thicken this wonderful sauce.  Think it would be great over brown rice.  This one is a keeper.  Thanks so much for sharing!

This was so tender and moist. I haven't had a pork roast come out of the slowcooker so yummy! I didn't have soy sauce so I substituted with worchesthire sauce, cut out the vinegar,tripled the ketchup, used 1/2 cup veg. broth, 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar, and lots of louisiana hot sauce! Talk about yummy!!!! MMMmmmmm...

I thought this recipe was incredibly easy and very tasty with little effort. I added a bit more hot sauce than called for (we like some kick) and added a little cornstarch mixed with water to thicken the sauce served with some brown and wild rice and was wonderful.  My husband loved it!

This is a great recipe.  The pork turned out great and was very tender.  I substituted 3T red wine vinegar, with 2T red wine and 1 T balsamic vinegar, and used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder.  I also added fresh mushrooms.  The sauce was a little lacking so I strained, it reduced it and added a packet of brown gravy mix and served over rice.  Very tasty.  Try this one, we all loved it.

I have to admit here..I am a very good cook/baker..but for some reason I had tried this recipe 3 times...each time it tasted good.but could have been better.....Then the 4th time I made it...It came out wonderful.  It will come out great if you follow the recipe ( I was forgetting things, and all kinds of errors) but now that I have mastered this EASY recipe.It too is my husbands favorite!  Thanks for sharing it!

My family loved this.  Even my picky 19 month old.  Mine ended up being a bit over done being that it was cooked on low for about 6 hours.  When I got home I turned off the cooker flipped the roast over to make sure it wasn't dried out and let it sit there for another 2 hours.  I doubled the juice/marinade except the sugar.  I also didn't put in any hot pepper or onion.

This is SOOOO yummy, and my husband, LOVED this! The meat just fell apart!  Definitely a keeper for our family menu.  I triple the sauce and added corn starch at the end to make gravy.  I also used brown sugar and only used 1/4 c.  I used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar and substituted barbeque sauce for the ketchup.

I don't eat meat and never tasted this, but I served it for Christmas dinner and it was a huge hit!  I did triple the sauce and used beef broth instead of water.  It was falling apart and MOIST even though it cooked for about 10 hours (just under 3 lbs) due to a lack of planning on my part.  Everyone loved this, and my hubby complimentd the vegetarian chef!

Excellent recipe...instead of using ketchup I used BBQ sauce...strained out the onions and made wonderful gravy to serve over the pork roast. I didn't increase the marinade...instead I turned the roast over every few hours...this made the roast very juicy.

This was awesome. My husband and kids loved it.  I left out the hot sauce because I was out, but would try it next time.  I thickened up the sauce a little and poured over the meat. The roast had a great flavor and fell apart it was so tender.  I served it with fried rice and it was a hit.  Will definately make again.

Was a great change from the ordinary...will definately make this again.  I used 6 boneless pork chops instead of the roast.  Also, out of necessity, used half of the soy sauce and a dash of worchestershire sauce.

This is our family's favorite pork roast recipe.  My husband asks for it all the time.  The only thing I do differently is to triple the sauce so the roast is more submerged in the slow cooker.

This was okay, but not spectacular.  I've never been able to find a "spectacular" slow cooker recipe for pork roast though, so I think it's more that than the actual recipe.

I found this recipe just this morning!  I already had pork chops thawed in the refridgerator, so I used chops instead of the roast.  It was excellent!  My kids even loved it, and they are impossible to please!  Will definitely make again.

i certainly suggest using bbq sauce instead of the ketchup. also, all i had on hand was rice wine vinegar, and it was still so good. next time, i will add in some mustard, as have seen it in other recipes, and it would work well here.

Easy to prepare.  The pork was very moist and tender.  I used a bone-in loin and it fell off of the bones!  I cut back on the onions, but the family was wishing I had kept to the recipe.  Will make again.

I really wanted to like this recipe and with all the wonderful reviews I thought I would, but it just didn't happen. My husband liked it, but I thought it was missing something in the taste like a key ingredient was missing even though we followed th recipe to a T. I guess we are used to a different flavor with our BBQ and it didn't taste like BBQ to me. Just like a plain dry roast with some sauce to go along with it. We have a lot of wonderful recipes for pork loin and considering the cost of a loin in our area, we'll be sticking with the other recipes. Sorry, but thanks anyway for the recipe.

This was wonderful!  I did not use a crock pot, but cooked mine on top of the stove for a few hours and it turned out great.  My husband especially loved it yet it was not too spicy or tangy for the kids to enjoy, too.  I will be making this again!

Roast is tasty.  It was good and reminded me of something my grandma use to make.  Only I feel it is missing something.  I will make it again. Next time try making a gravy out of the sauce and adding dill or something.  The roast is very tender.

This roast was delicious!  I doubled the sauce ingredients as suggested and served over rice the first day.  Day two, we shredded it and mixed it with BBQ sauce and had it on buns.  It was tender and moist and is definitely a keeper.

This recipe was OK.  I was lingering between a 3 and 4 for the rating, but choose the 4.  I thought the recipe was good, but as far as being a great dish - it just wasn't there for me.  Would I eat it again?  Yes, it was good.  Would I purposely make this again?  Unfortunately not, but thanks for the recipe...I just felt it was missing the finishing touch.

This recipe was a hit.  I made this for a dinner party and the  platter was left empty!  The only change I will make for next time, is making extra sauce.  It was very tasty.

This is absolutely fantastic. I've never received a complaint on this one and I've made it many, many times. It's a great dinner to bring anywhere since it's done in the crock pot. Very simple. I usually throw in some potatoes near the last 1-2 hours. Love this!

This was good and easy.  I had all the ingredients on hand, which is a plus for me.  After cooking, I poured the juices into a small pan.  I made a cornstarch slurry and added it to the juices to make a thicker sauce.

When I made thjis I wasn't sure what type of meat I had to cook...might have been pork, might have been lamb. At a friends suggestion I added tomatoes and thyme. Turned out it was beek shank and it was delish!

My husband and I LOVED this.  He couldn't stop telling me how much he liked it. The only thing I did differently is that I doubled all of the juice ingredients to make sure it didn't dry out (we commute a good distance and are gone for 12 hours/day).  The only ingredient that I did NOT double was the sugar.  It was great....I made gravy out of the juice but you really didn't even need it...we just used the juices instead!  YUM

This was pretty good, hubby liked it more than I did, I thought it was too sweet, and I used a little less sugar than it asked for. It was very moist, that I did like. I hate dry pork. All in all, it was OK.

My wife usually does most of the cooking in our home.  However, after having most of a hog in our freezer for awhile, I took it upon myself to rid the stock.  I had no idea what to do with a pork roast so I searched and found this site immediately.  This recepie was voted outstanding by the whole family.  The only change I made was replacing the ketchup with bbq sauce.  My hat is off! I will be back...

I did not care for this recipe at all. After looking at the previous reviews, I made this on a Sunday for my husband and I.  We were both extremely disappointed.  The meat itself was just ok, and the gravy was not to our tastes at all.  The gravy turned out really sweet, and wasn't what we were expecting when the title was "tangy pork roast".  We will never make this again.

We loved this recipe!  I have used it 2 times so far and both times the roast has turned out melt in your mouth great.  My roasts were a bit larger size so I doubled the recipe (all except the onion) so the roast was covered better.  Leftovers were very good chopped up with bbq sauce added for sandwiches.

This has a unique flavor which maybe in time, you can develop a taste for.  Roast should be browned before putting into crock pot.

I do Keto and so I had to make some changes plus I had a 3 1/2 lb. roast so I increased every thing by 1/3.  Also all my ingredient were organic and grass fed for the most part. 
Instead of water i used Chicken Bone Broth, Walmart brand of Splenda,  and I add some Paprika. It was some super tender that when I touched it it fell into pieces which was a good thing and the taste was AWESOME

My roast was 4.8 pounds, so I had to alter the cook time and additional ingredients.  I doubled all seasonings, but still felt this was lacking in flavor.  I should have read the reviews before cooking.  Oh well. lesson learned. My 13 year old daughter ate it, and she doesn't like tangy flavors, but my husband and I both thought it was a bit bland. We added additional flavor at the table, so it turned out ok!

Sorry, but I have to agree with reviewers who said this didn't have much flavor.  Perhaps it would be better with less water, but I won't make it again.

I loved the taste of this, but I only cooked a 1 1/2 lb boneless loin roast, and even 5 hrs was way too long. It was tasty but a little dry. I'd make it again, but I think 4 hrs for this size is plenty.

I made this today, but had to use dried onion flakes, (still put them on bottom of crock), and I only had balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar. I cooked it on high for 2 & 1/2 hours, then dropped it to low for 1 & 1/2 hours. An hour before finish, I added frozen stir-fry veggies. It was FANTASTIC! We could cut the meat with a fork, it was SO tender, juicy and flavorful!

I added several baby carrots to the cook. After an hour or so I tried one of the carrots, and I immediately dumped the rest of them in, it gave them a delicious flavor! I've made this recipe a few times already, it's a family favorite! - This latest cook, 3/19, I did cut back the vinegar by half, and one third of the sugar and found it better this time.  Being Italian, of course I doubled the garlic! Molto Bene!

Was delish- used instant pot on slow cooker- took roast out- placed in oven for a few minutes to brown top. Placed IP on saute to heat marinade-  then added 2 TBS of cornstarch with water slurry to thicken gravy. This was so tasty- made it with buttered noodles & green beans. Will make this again

Disappointing. I made it as instructed, adding potatoes and carrots but had to keep adding salt, pepper, soy sauce and finally a multi-spice seasoning. Just bland.

My whole family loves this dish. I make it according to the directions,  and I use the juice to make gravy. I serve it with mashed potatoes and green beans.

Was dry when using a Beef boneless roast! No matter how much liquid or length of time!! Keep to the Pork loin roast and the 8hr cooking time!!

Loved this recipe! I followed recipe except I used Worcestershire sauce instead of soy sauce because I didn't have any and I put cut potatoes under roast instead of onion and used onion powder. The whole family loved it and it will be a new favorite in the house! ????

Very good if you make the drippings/broth into a gravy. Definitely an important additional step.

Soooo bland, and dry. I truly don't understand how this could be dry since I cooked it in liquid for 4 hours, but it was. I rarely leave reviews, but I had to make an exception with this one.

An instant family favorite!  Wonderfully subtle flavored sauce that does not overwhelm.  A smashed garlic clove substitued for garlic powder is the only alteration I would make.  Thanks for a great new twist to our pork loving family.

Prior to this recipe I had never cooked a roast in the slow cooker so I do not know if the results stem from this recipe or simply just how it was prepared but the roast turned out very tender and juicy. I cannot give this recipe a higher score however because I could discern no real tangy flavor, to me the roast, while tender and juicy, tasted almost exactly like a plain pork roast. In other reviews others have pointed out that they needed to up the seasonings to make this flavorful, one user also recommended piercing the roast several times with a fork prior to cooking. if I were to make this recipe again I would definitely use the above suggestions. If you follow the recipe as written expect to both have an above average roast and be sorely disappointed.

It was just okay.  I added the potatoes and carrots as someone suggested and maybe should have added more liquid or ???  It just seemed very dry on top and not that much flavor.  Will not be doing it again, sorry.

It was OK however I will double most of the seasonings and I'd sear the roast next time as well.  I will say it was very tender and the drippings made a wonderful gravy.

I added (4 Tbsp) cider vinegar instead of red wine vinegar.   I added red wine (3 Tbsp) , fresh thyme sprigs, fresh parsley, generous amount of fresh garlic, a pinch of Italian oregano and 2 slices of jalapeno pepper for heat to off-set its overly sweet emphasis.  
It is unlikely I will repeat the original recipe.

Almost a  5 star.  Not sure about the need for sugar.  And I did add a little more pepper throughout the cooking process to counteract all of the salt.  Other than that i did it step by step with one exception.  I did sear the pork with a couple of tbsp olive oil, onion and minced garlic.   Once i had it to desired sear, I placed in slow cooker.  I then added beef stock and red wine vinegar to the drippings and boiled for about a minute.  I poured that over the roast before adding the other sauce ingredients.  I cooked on high for about 4.5 hours for a 2.8lb loin. Turned out great.

This came out really good!! I added carrots, celery and potatoes to the bottom of my slow cooker before adding the roast on top. I floured and seared the roast then set on top the veggies. Poured liquid over all, 4 hours on high and it was all done, so simple with great flavor. Definitely a keeper!!!

I made a few changes, nothing major. I made it with white rice & instead of using a hot sauce, I used sarachi chili sauce since it has a nice subtle sting to it on the sweeter side. I didnt have red wine vinegar in the house so I used apple cider vinegar which gave it more tang. I used white sugar as directed but when I make it again,(which I most definetly will-it was very good plus my husband devoured it) lol,,but as I was saying I think brown sugar should be substituted for the white sugar. Anyways...we liked it..this was well worth the wait of the slow cooker crock pot & it sure  made the house smell scrumptious! Recommended!!

I made this exactly as written and we all loved it! I used her suggestion of serving over noodles along with peas, but next time I'll serve over rice or mashed potatoes, since the noodles don't absorb the juice at all. The flavor is so yummy!!

The very best meal I've had in a long time! I paired it with crock potatoes 
I can't believe how good it was! I even got a thumbs up from my very picky husband!!!


I tweaked the recipe a bit because I didn't have red wine vinegar. Instead, I used distilled white vinegar. 

I will definitely make this again!!!

I made this recipe exactly how it instructed.  I was curious how it would turn out because of all the different reviews.  It was delicious.  The meat was tender and the flavor was unbelievable.  We loved it.  I can't wait for another pork loin roast night again.

Made it - as written. . We liked it :) But I think the cook times for the slow cooker are too long. I reduced the time, bit the roast was still overdone.

Wonderful flavor combination. I used balsamic vinegar instead of red, left out the sugar,  thickened the sauce with some flour and added a little sherry.

I did not change a thing.  The roast was nice but I wasn't gaga over the sauce.  I'll probably make it again but leave out the red wine vinegar and soy sauce.

I made this last night and left in the slow cooker for 7 hours on low. The meat was very tender and juicy. Not dry at all. Loved it will make again.

3 and a half stars (not 4) My roast was dry but I used the au jus to moisten it. The roast was also falling apart so we are going to have it as pulled pork for the second night. (I mixed BBQ sauce with cooking liquid to store.) Good flavor!

I had high hopes for t his recipe and was very disappointed. First, with a 2.5 pound pork loin, I cooked it on "low" for 6 hours. The roast was dry and tough -- even difficult to slice. My husband liked the sauce, but I thought it was too sweet. Neither of us were happy with the taste of the roast, and I would definitely not make this again. I did as several others suggested and added quartered red-skin potatoes to the bottom of the slow-cooker under the onions. The potatoes and onions were the bast part of the dish!

Really good, and easy!  I did up the spices a bit, and used the water, cut the sugar back some.  The sauce made a great gravy reduced on the stove.  Pork was very tender.

This turned out good as written.  I added some halved red potatoes and carrots to the slow cooker as well without changing any other ingredients.  Could probably cut down on the sugar a bit and even add some additional seasoning to get more flavor next time.  I would probably make gravy out of the juice b/c the pork loin was a little dry and the juice was wonderful but needed to be thickened.

What wonderful flavor!  I used a stuffed pork shoulder and followed recipe adding sliced potatoes to crockpot.    A keeper!  Using the left over juices and pork as a basis for chow mein.

This was very good.  The family loved it!  I did make a few modifications based on other feedback.  I had a four lb roast and I excluded the water, so I tripled most ingredients.  However, I only doubled the vinegar and sugar (Splenda).  I quartered the roast and browned it prior to putting it in the slow cooker.  This turned out great with very good flavor.

This is a huge hit at my house! Even with 2 kids! The sugar makes it sweet and they even eat all of the vegetables.  I replace the red wine vinegar with white wine vinegar simply because that's what I have on hand and it turned out great so I see no reason to change it. I do add a tad more garlic, and just the small dash of hot sauce, but playing with those 2 ingredients can change the flavor to your taste. Pork is nice and tender on low 6-7 hrs for my crock pot. Love this!

This recipe is amazing. My family really enjoys this. I've made this with apple cider vinegar and with pomegranate infused red wine vinegar and both of those flavors have played in my favor. Also we slow cook it for 9-10 hours and the meat just melts in your mouth.

Wonderful roast! We had a huge one, almost 6 lbs. I substituted beef broth for the water and used only one cup. I doubled everything else and changed sugar to brown and the vinegar to balsamico.  Instead of ketchup andd hot pepper sauce, I used chili sauce. I used two large onions and managed to stuff 4 carrots, rough cut, in beside the roast. It was done in less than 6 hours despite the size. The vegetables were very tasty and the leftovers heated up well and also made a terrific pork teriyaki following (more or less) the Pork and Pepper Stir Fry recipe at All Recipes.

I doubled the sauce, but based on other reviews omitted the water and added about 1/4 cup chicken broth and 1/4 cup red wine (total).  I also subbed balsamic vinegar for the red wine vinegar.  I used two 1.5 lb tenderloins. Cooked on high two hours and then low for almost three hours.  Thickened the sauce on the stovetop with cornstarch. The meat came out moist and with decent flavor. It was an interesting sauce, but not nearly savory enough for my tastes. Maybe too much sugar, or maybe I took a wrong step with the addition of red wine.  I'm sure the recipe is tweakable, but I'll probably try something different altogether in the future.

I put in fresh garlic instead of garlic powder. Great taste. I made pulled pork with left overs. Tasted just as good the next day. I will definitely make this again.

This had to be the most boring meal we've had in a very long time.  Bland to look at, no plating appeal whatsoever and the taste was nothing special.  Will not be repeating this one.

I followed the recipe as shown.  I found this to be quite excellent!  The sauce was delicious!!!  Next time I'm thinking of doubling the sauce and adding some veggies. Thanks for sharing!

The pork was melt in your mouth good.  I made it according to the recipe and served it with baked potatoes and sour cream green beans and apple sauce.  I would definitely make it that way again.

Excellent!  I used honey instead of sugar and added a tbsp of sweet habanero sauce.  Prepared everything in slow cooker pot the night before and let it sit overnight in fridge.

I make this pork roast at least 3-4 times a month and it is delicious. I have since added a little more garlic (1 Tbs minced garlic) to the suggested amount because I love garlic but the taste to this basic recipe is wonderful. My whole family enjoys this roast!

Used tender loin, all I had,  and as suggested balsamic vinegar in place of white and brown sugar in place of white.  Added the ginger to the spices and when loin was done, removed liquid and added cornstarch to make gravy.  Nice and sweet.

I rated it a four. I side with those that thought it is too bland. However my spouse, who is not a big fan of pork roasts, actually enjoyed it. Fearing it may be too bland due to some of the reviews, I prepared some brown country gravy. That helped make it taste better  for my palette. When I make it again, I'll cut down on the white sugar, not the best for diabetics and increase the garlic. But overall, it's a keeper, especially when you can get someone who is not a fan of pork roasts to actually enjoy the meal.

Simply very delicious, I did make a few changes I put 6 small slits in the pork inserted slices of fresh garlic also added butter, garlic and olive oil to the frying pan browned the pork on both sides, mixed 2 cups of beef stock instead of water with 1/4 tsp paprika, 1/4 tsp of dry mustard, 1/2 tsp black pepper, 3 tsp. Louisiana hot sauce, 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar, 1 cup sugar, 3 tsp low sodium soy sauce, 1/4 tsp salt, 2 tsp ketchup, mixed all ingredients in a bowl, sliced large onion placed on bottom of slow cooker, placed pork on onions poured the remaining olive oil butter and garlic over the pork then poured mixed ingredients on top of pork cooked on low for 8 hrs. After 4 hours I added 8 oz of baby Bella mushrooms cooked remaining 4 hrs on low. Added corn starch to some of the gravy on the side for the mashed potatoes. It came out delicious it's definitely a keeper

The only changes  
I made was I omitted the hot sauce - because I forgot to add it.  Had some homemade chicken broth so added that to the roast and then mixed everything else and poured over roast - super Yummy!  And the gravy I poured off and thickened with some corn starch - super yummy too - will make again.  Thanks  also substituted maple syrup for the sugar.

Really a nice recipe. Couldn't have been easier.  I did not add the water. I only made two changes: brown sugar only and added about a tsp of minced ginger from a jar. Pork fell apart--we had it for three meals. The last batch we drained, covered with BBQ sauce and made the best sandwiches ever. Thanks for the recipe !!

Great recipe. I sliced red potatoes and layered the bottom of my crockpot, sliced onion on top of that. Put the pork in and tossed a bunch of whole baby carrots, sliced potatoes about 1/2" thick, and then poured sauce over top for about 3 hours on high. Pulled the roast and stirred things up and put the roast back in for another 3 hours on high(mine was frozen). Poured half of a bud light over the top and then a French onion soup mix and it turned out excellent. Served with green beans that cooked in butter and minced garlic along with a packet of brown gravy mix for the veggies and roast.

I chopped the onion and put 3/4 in bottom and mixed the rest with the sauce.  Tender and delicious for pulled pork.  I let the grease congeal and then cooked down the sauce with onions to mix with pulled pork to make it moist.  Excellent!  This will be a standard for my grandsons!

Ok, I read reviews. I did not brown it. I used a 1/2 of cup of water and brown sugar instead of white. I did not have hot sauce. I also used minced garlic not powder. But I kept everything else the same.  When I took the pork out, I took two forks and shredded the pork in a serving bowl. I then poured the liquid on top. The liquid was thin, but I used a slotted spoon to serve it, and the flavor was delicious. I served it with roasted potatoes and vegetables. My family loved it!

It turned out really good. It was a larger roast and it was bone-in, but it was fall-apart tender. Will definitely make again, maybe increase the seasonings a bit.

Absolutely delicious. I followed another poster's suggestion and doubled the sauce, cut the water, changed white sugar to brown, used fresh garlic, and balsamic vinegar rather than red wine. It is my husbands new favorite. So so good!!!

I deviated from the recipe on the end product. I made a roux and drained all the liquid from the slow cooker and poured it into the roux to thicken the sauce. It made for a very tasty addition to the recipe for those of you like myself how don't enjoy a runny sauce. Served with redskin mashed potatoes. Next time I make this, I will try putting carrots and potatoes into the slow cooker but overall I was happy with the recipe.

I made this recipe as written. I found it rather bland, not tasty at all. It was better as leftovers for sandwiches.
  I will not make it again. Maybe adding apples or using honey in place of the soy sauce would improve the taste.
   Not recommended

I followed the directions of a previous reviewer. Turned out well, but I wasn't expecting the pork to fall apart. Next time I will serve it with rolls.

This was delicious!  I used Balsamic Vinegar as I didn't have red wine vinegar and added a touch of sage, but it would have been delicious if made as per the original recipe, I'm sure. Thank you!

I made this and added 5 baby potatoes cut in half and 6 baby carrots to the slow cooker.
I also used a boned pork shoulder. My wife and I loved it.

I followed the recipe as is - only exception was I browned the pork with some butter before putting it in the slow cooker. This turned out to be quite dry and bland :(

My husband and I absolutely LOVED this recipe, and most definitely will be making it again. I did, however, make a few changes: instead of 1/4 cup of white sugar, I used two tbs of brown, and did not add any extra salt (the soy sauce provided plenty of sodium in my opinion). When the roast was done, I heated the sauces in a saucepan with a bit of butter, a mixture of cornstarch and water (2 tbs cornstarch, 2 tbs water), waited until it bubbled and became thick, and drizzled it over the roast as a gravy. We served it with stuffing and broccoli and it was SUPERB. Thanks so much for sharing! We loved it!

I will definitely make it again.  I would make more juice it was great.  Thanks for the tips on how to adjust - my only change was browning the meat and balsamic vinegar instead of wine just because I had it.  Thanks

I forgot to find a recipe and my roast was thawed and we were walking out the door. This was the first thing that popped up in my search. I didn't read any reviews and I'm thankful I didn't because I probably would have altered it. It was great! I didn't have soy sauce so I used worcestershire sauce  instead. Amazing! Next time I may sear it or maybe not. It was so good!!

Easy, even my very picky eater grandkids liked when I bought nice rolls & stirred in a little barbecue sauce for pulled pork sandwiches. My husband & I loved it just as it was. I will definitely  make this again.

Amazing recipe! I made this for Valentine's and my boyfriend went bonkers! I had a slightly larger roast, so I doubled the ingredients (aside from the  sugar and ketchup to cut down on sweetness), and I used balsamic instead of red wine vinegar because we like the flavours a lot better. Turned the residual liquid into gravy while meat was resting by adding flour/water and heating on high.  Will definitely make again!

This will be my go-to pork recipe for the slow cooker.  Because we love veggies I added diced Yukon gold potato, sweet potato, turnips and parsnips.    Otherwise I didn't change a thing.  Excellent!  Everyone loved it.

Pork came out too tough and dried out both times i made this..little to no flavor either...followed directions exactly the first time....  Second time it was ok, i doubled the ingredients and injected a sugar/water/worchishire sauce into it, it helped a little bit as far as giving the pork more flavor. but i definitely wont be making this again.

Amazing!  I used some Pork Top Loin on sale at Costco with a cayenne pepper sauce and it melted in the mouth and was an excellent combination of sweet, spice, and of course "tang". Making it tomorrow for some friends!

I made this with the sauce/broth as listed, but I put a layer of cut up red potatoes in between the onions and the pork, and I surrounded the pork with baby carrots. Even after 5 hours, on low and 1 hour on high, the potatoes and Carrots did not cook all the way. I added the veggies because I had noticed that the pork tenderloin I used in previous slow cooker recipes were over done, next time, I will lightly cook the potatoes and carrots before hand and possibly add more liquid. I think then it will rate 5 stars

THis was very disappointing.  I set it on high for only 5 hours and it fell apart; I didn't want shredded pork plus it was too sweet my kids hated it.  Will not be making this again.

Very good.  Tangy sauce.  This makes a tender pork roast and vegies are full of flavor.  Put potatoes and chunks of carrot around the roast.  Slowed cooked for 5 hours.  Very tasty.

I have been making this recipe about once a month for a year or so--my family loves it! I make it as written, except I double the sauce.  We shred the pork and serve over rice. The sauce is thin, but we don't mind.

Came out great! Left out the ketchup (didn't have any) and hot sauce (not a fan of spicy) and used cloves of garlic instead of the powder. Not too sweet at all.

Delicious!  I did make a few changes.  I used Worstershire Sauce instead of Soy Sauce, and Cooking Sherry instead of Wine just because that's what I had on hand.  I thickened the sauce and served it over noodles.  My husband and I both loved it!

It definitely needs more flavor! Halfway thru cooking I cut the roast into fourths to absorb more flavor, and I'm glad I did.  This is a keeper, but will need some revisions for my family's tastes.

I got so many compliments on this it was crazy. I've made it again this morning and have reduced the sugar a bit. If it changes the overall flavor too much, I will report back.

This was really good! I don't have ketchup so I used barbecue sauce instead. I admit I wasn't a fan of the cooking liquid when I made it but once cooked it was very good. The pork was tender and moist.

I tried this today with some minor changes. I don't keep regular sugar in the house, so I substituted Splenda. In addition, I used minced garlic in place of garlic powder. I also salt and peppered the meat prior to putting it in the crockpot. The meat is very juicy and so tender that it all fell apart, so I just shredded it and served on top of brown rice w/ a side of steamed carrots. I cooked mine on low for 5 hours and then on high for 1 hour. Perfect!

Added baby red potatoes at the bottom, onions over that, then the pork roast. Surrounded that with the baby carrots and poured in my mixture. Cooked on high for 2 hours then low for about 3 more.  Fantastic!

Was really pleased with how this turned out - much better than expected! However, I did make a few modifications. Instead of white sugar, I used a mixture of brown sugar, honey, and a little apple juice (to taste) for more flavor, which I think made a big difference. Also, for some heat, I used sriracha sauce. I also used fresh minced garlic instead of garlic powder. I threw in some baby carrots and a few small potatoes to make it a one-pot meal! I was really pleased and we ate it right up.

Yum, this recipe is delicious! I made it exactly to the recipe minus the hot sauce because I don't like hot things. It is so good! I made Suzy's Red Mashed Potatoes from this site to go along with it. Highly recommend.

Great over mashed potatoes and green beans fried with bacon on the side. Everyone loved it.   I used a rib roast, and that was a mistake. It was too dry. I will use a rump roast next time.

Made this recipe today and After trying to salvage it, ended up ordering pizza. I was careful to measure everything. It was very acidic and spoiled a lovely pork roast. That one's off the list for sure.

This recipe has potential. Definitely double seasonings (as stated in another review) and leave out the sugar completely. I only used 1/2 of the sugar the recipe called for and it was too sweet. I also used 2 cups of vegetable broth instead of 1 cup water and added a little flour so it wasn't so soupy.

So darn easy and really delicious.  Whole family loved it.  Came out very moist and flavorful.  Added the finished "broth" that was left with chicken gravy I had and it was wonderful.  Also good with apple sauce.  The onions were nice to eat with it too.  Will definately make again!

This turned out well but the juices were a bit sweeter than I preferred. Next time, I will use less sugar, a more tart vinegar, and more hot sauce.  I added potatoes, carrots, celery so it made a whole meal.  Goes great with french bread to sop up the juice!

Awesome  I definite have again!  I took the suggestions, pierced the roast and doubled the sauce.   Only other change I made was instead of hot sauce I cored, seeded and chopped a jalapeno and put it in. This is one of the best recipes I have tried!

We didn't like it at all. Gave it 2 stars because we added potatoes and there's a slight chance that threw it off... but we thought it was very bland and the meat was tough. We won't make it again.

It was certainly juicy but had absolutely NO flavor.  I had to add lots of salt and make a separate sauce to give it some tangy-ness.  I won't be making this again.

Eating this now as I rate it! Delicious! I only gave it four stars because I did make some changes based on other reviews. I added honey, omitted the salt and used beef broth instead of water. Cooked on low for 7 hours and used country style ribs. I also added cornstarch to thicken up the gravy. The meat is so tender, it is falling apart with a fork. It is a little dry, however, I added baby carrots that soaked up all of the flavor and add a nice "juiciness" to the whole dish. Definitely will make again!

Outstanding recipe - the whole family loved it, and several do not tend to like slow cooker meals.

Wow!  Awesome flavor!  My picky meat eaters LOVED it! I slowed cooked it with the potatoes, carrots and onions, just like the picture.  This dish will definitely make it into my regular rotation.

This was terrific! I followed the recipe with a few changes because it's what I have on hand. I used apple cider vinegar instead of what it called for, I used raw sugar instead of white. I did add an extra dash of hot sauce because we like it that way. I kept everything in the same amounts the recipe asked for.It turned out fabulous!

This turned out to be super delicious!  I made a few adjustments to the recipe.  For the sauce I used chicken broth instead of water, balsamic vinegar, teriyaki sauce, a little hoisin sauce and a few dashes of Smoked/Chipotle Tabasco sauce and minced garlic.  First, I sliced an onion and red bell pepper in thick slices and put them in the bottom of the crock pot.  Then, I seared a 2 lb pork roast in a very hot saute pan w/small amt of olive oil to give it some color and placed it on top of the onions/peppers, then seasoned the pork with salt and pepper and rubbed some minced garlic on the outside. I added 6-7 small red potatoes cut in half or quarters around the roast.  Then poured the sauce over the top and voila.  Next time, I'll make more sauce because it was so good.  It was thin but you could remove some it and make a gravy by adding a corn starch slurry.

I suspected the low-raters were correct on this on, but I gave it a chance based on the high ratings.  This is a very ordinary dish.  It's fine for the family, and I've enjoyed it at family meals, but I would never serve it to guests.  I did take one hint and added only half the sugar called for, and to my taste it was still too sweet.

Way too sweet!!!  This is not tangy.  It is sweet.  I cut the sugar by half and still ended up with sweet pork.  I will try it again and reduce the sugar/catsup to a minimal.  Otherwise, I love the dish.

Prepared exactly as written. Way too sweet and extremely dry. We are a family of six and have varying tastes so I am never surprised or put out if someone doesn't care for a recipe. However, no one liked this and no one went back for seconds. I hope others find this review helpful and look for another recipe.

Loved this. I marinated the roast in a little teriyaki sauce I had left in a bottle overnight.  Instead of the sugar I used apricot preserves.

I followed the directions exactly except that I added celery that I used with the onions under the roast & I substituted Splenda for half of the of sugar. It really smelled smelled great but it was very dry and didn't have much taste. We were really disappointed. We had been smelling it for hours. I will chop the rest of it and put it in BBQ sauce.

This just came out amazing.  After reading the comments, used balsamic vinegar instead of read wine, and I halved the sugar.  The flavor was so so good! Will definitely look to do again.

The roast was really good, but the real surprise was the fantastic lentil soup I made from the remaining juices and pork. To the juices/broth, I added one cup of the shredded pork, then a pound of lentils, with some vegetables. I had the best soup we've ever had. We all decided it was the soy sauce/vinegar combination that made it taste so different.

This turned out very well. We could either slice the roast for a meal plate or pull apart for sandwiches while adding BBQ sauce. So many serving options with this recipe.

This recipe is delicious. I have fixed it many times and my entire family loves it.  Tangy flavor and very juicy.   The pork just fall apart.  Put over top of mashed potatoes or on a bun.  Outstanding, hardy meal for my boys.

Great weeknight recipe!  I used white wine vinegar because I didn't have any red wine vinegar.  It was still very good but I would recommend cutting down on the sugar a little if you use that substitution.  I served over egg noodles.  The whole family loved it and made left overs!

Absolutely awesome!  My entire family loved this recipe!  The pork was so tender,  it fell apart.  I doubled the marinade and added more garlic powder.  Also added whole baby carrots and made it a stew.  Delicious!

My husband and friends absolutely love this - even better than pulled pork. I buy the whole pork loin when it comes on sale for $1.88 a pound, divide into three roasts and freeze the other two. I omit the salt and cut the sugar down a bit. I also choose to double the sauce recipe. So easy and delicious!

very flavourable. I found it to be a little salty, but my boyfriend loved it and devoured it. Since I made it for him, it was a hit! :)

Very good flavor, and cooking it in the slow cooker made a tougher roast very tender.  I added a little white wine that I needed to use up, otherwise made it as written.

Great recipe and very easy. I spiced it up a little with crushed red pepper which added to the flavor since I noticed that many people said the flavor was lacking. I also cooked it with potatoes and onions and then boiled the sauce down on the stove afterwards which helped to finish cooking the potatoes. YUM!

This was a hit! I was looking for something simple to do with my crock pot, pork loin, and what I had on hand, and this fit the bill!  Once I made it, everyone ate it readily, and used the juices to put over top of everything else on their plates (green beans and mashed potatoes.)  I love the onions on the bottom, they create a nice barrier to keep the roast from drying out. ;)  Thanks for a great recipe! :D

The flavors of this are delicious. I added garlic chili sauce and Worcestershire sauce and instead of water used beef broth. I added new potatoes under the roast and carrots on the side. Really good and tender but I just can't seem to get used to the consistency of the pork in the crockpot. When it is shredded it is great but sliced is not my favorite.

My husband raved about this.  I thought it was good enough to play around with and continue to refine the flavours.  The onions were SO good.  After reading other peoples' reviews. I omitted the water, substituted indonesian BBQ sauce for the ketchup and thickened the sauce with cornstarch.  I didn't find it to have too much vinegar at all.  

This is an easy weeknight meal which can be served with buttered noodles and a green salad.

I made this recipe very close to the recipe and my family loved it!  I doubled the garlic and added a dash of Worchestershire sauce instead of the hot sauce. The onions turned out nice and the pork roast was nice and juicy.  I thought I might add some cranberry sauce to the pot the next time.  I made a gravy out of the juice by placing the juice in a saucepan and adding a cornstarch slurry. Yum!!

Yum!  Made with a 1.3 lb roast - didn't change the sauce, had no onions so i used carrots and celery on bottom.  I also sprinkled the roast heavily with onion flakes.

Made this tonight for dinner. Made it just as written. Very tasty. The only thing I would do different would be to double the sauce. I may thicken the sauce as a gravy.  I served it with garlic buttered noodles and corn.

WOW!!!!!!! Here's the trite phrase, "I hardly ever leave reviews but this I had to" 
I substituted the Red Wine Vinegar for Balsamic Vinegar and the turn out was AMAZING!!!! I'm new to slow cooking food and tried this for my first pork loin, and was blown away at the yummy taste!! I have grown up eating all kinds of slow cooked meat and this is by far the best I've ever tasted. I even just tried this with tri tip today and still delicious! I am so glad I came across this recipe, I will always use it!! Thank you for such a fantastic recipe!

Was very excited to try this recipe so even more disappointed that it didn't turn out.  Followed the directions exactly and ended up with a roast that had no taste!  Also, it wasn't completely cooked after 4hrs on high in the slow-cooker so had to throw in the oven to finish cooking.  Sliced it and served on buns for sandwiches which were ok, but add to add lots of salt and a cople of condiments to make it edible.  Definitely wouldn't want to eat it on its own so won't be making this again.  No flavour.

This is an amazingly easy and succulent recipe. Since hot pepper sauce is not a staple in our home, I usually substitute a couple of spoonfuls of salsa or picante sauce. Otherwise, I do the recipe as written. Our family loves this served over whole wheat egg noodles.

This recipe turned out great.  I made a few changes to reflect my family's tastes - I chopped up some fresh garlic and ginger, and sprinkled on top.  I also rubbed the meat with a Morrocan rub.  And I added potatoes, carrots, and red peppers to the crock pot.  What an easy and delicious dinnner!

I tried this and it turned out pretty good, except that 3-4 hours on high totally dried my roast out.  It was also a little too sweet for me. I did use balsalmic vinegar, since it was all I had, instead of red wine vinegar.  I also used cayenne pepper instead of hot sauce for the same reason.  Next time, I will use brown sugar, more cayenne, and no salt.  I think you get plenty saltiness from the soy sauce. Overall, great starter recipe and super easy.

Made this for a New Year's Eve dinner party, it was ok-not the best, would not make it again.
Not really impressed with it.  I had to thickened the sauce.  I agree that the seasoning and flavor need to be increased for a slow cooker recipe.  The pork loin looked like it was boiled (white)  I would recommend substituting the water for beef broth and cut back on the sugar.

I thought this was really good.  I did add extra garlic powder and added minced garlic since I love the flavor of garlic.  It was not overpowering.  I also didn't put it in the crockpot but put it in the oven.  I took the juice that was in the pan and made an au jus with it to put over the pork when we ate it. I would definitely make again.

Very good and easy recipe for quick dinner! I added potatoes to the crock pot to soak in the flavor and make it a full meal. I am not a fan of traditional roasts so the tangy sauce in this recipe really gave it an interesting and different flavor for me! I will definitely use this again!

holy !!! my family absolutely loved this!!! when I hear "this is a keeper" I know its good. And its tough to please my bunch sometimes. Only thing I changed was I used apple cider vinegar instead of red wine vinegar because that's what I had, and I do think it made a difference since apple goes better with pork. I will definitely be making this again!!!

This recipe was so easy, tasty, and tender!  Since some reviewers complained about the sweetness, I eliminated the sugar altogether (kept the ketchup).  Others suggested doubling the spices and flavorings, so I decided to just add everything to taste.  The family loved the results!

This is an awesome pork roast recipe!  Just loved it and went back for seconds.  I read a few other reviews before starting and cut the sugar in half. This still makes it sweet enough.  I used  a tblsp of ponzu sauce and soy sauce.  I used about a tsp of chili garlic sauce for just the right heat.  Would make this again and again.

Delicious! I made very few changes - left out the water, used minced garlic instead of powder, also nearly doubled sauce (less the water).  The flavors were great.  I poked the roast with a knife a few times to give the sauce a chance to get inside the meat.  Ended up cooking it a bit longer 'cuz I was late getting home from work.  My husband has declared this a keeper and something I need to make again soon.

This recipe was a HUGE hit with my husband and 4 kids.  I did increase the amount of spices a bit, but you can't go wrong with this recipe.  I did not use the hot pepper sauce the first couple of times I've made this, but may try it for extra kick.  I let the roast cook in the crock pot all day, and then pulled it apart for sandwiches.  MELT IN YOUR MOUTH yummy!  No need for BBQ sauce or mustard on the bun ~ the meat and au jus has excellent flavor.  Would definitely recommend this recipe!

This is one of the greatest pork roast recipes out there. I have made it numerous times and it's always a hit. I add just a touch of bottled BBQ sauce before serving (1/4 cup-ish) and make it into pulled pork sammies (great on Hawaiian rolls!). Great football food!

I didn't have a roast handy, but did have some country style boneless pork ribs. So I used those.  Fabulous and EASY !!!!  I read the other reviews, and did use more hot sauce, but I kept all other ingredients pretty much to the recipe.  I would add more pepper and garlic powder next time as we like a little more flavor. When it was done, I shredded it and will serve it as pulled pork sandwiches.  !!!! Definitely will use this again as a nice departure from traditional BBQ pulled pork.

This was just so-so - nothing special, but not bad either. Both my hubs and I found this to be quite bland and simply lacking any "WOW" factor. Had I made a gravy out of the sauce, I think this would have been MUCH better (but I wasn't in the mood to make this any more involved than it needed to be...). :) I must say, K's idea of serving over egg noodles with a side of sugar snap peas was spot on (we actually enjoyed the sides MORE than the main dish!). Because plain noodles seemed boring to me, I tossed them with a little butter and toasted sesame seeds (mmmm!!!). For a no-fuss meal, this was above average, but taste wise, it wasn't what I'd hoped for. I am going to try serving leftovers "sandwich style" slathered with BBQ sauce to see if that suits us better. Maybe this will float your boat, but it needs a little tweaking to impress us. Thanks anyways, K. :-)

My hubby and I love this recipe.  It has amazing flavor.  I added 3-4 T of hot sauce because we like spicier foods, but not at all neccessary.  I made 1.5 times the broth/marinade and used the extra liquid to make gravy afterwards with butter and flour.  Excellent recipe.

My only variations were 2 small onions (I didn't have any large ones), and I doubled the sauce ingredients because I had a larger roast.  Amazing!!  My boyfriend started pulling pieces off before it was even time to eat, and he loved the onions.  I'll follow another review and use the sauce and some BBQ sauce for sandwiches for lunch tomorrow.

This was one of the best recipes for the crock pot I've ever made.  My husband, being Cajun, seasoned the meat with some Slap Ya Mama seasoning, but the marinade was amazing with no changes!  After dinner we thickened some leftover with a rue to make it more gumbo style too.

Easy and delicious!  Served with sauteed green beans and mushrooms and got the thumbs up from both my husband and my 3 year old - not an easy feat.  My only deviation from the recipe as written was to use 1 tsp of fresh garlic instead of garlic powder.  I also made a roux of 2 tbsp each of butter and flour to thicken the jus into a gravy.  I'll make this regularly.

I used a bone-in pork loin roast because that is what I had in the freezer. Thought the "broth" was extremely tasty. I would use this recipe again with a boneless pork roast. I reduced the broth as well as one of the other readers did and felt the flavor was richer by doing this. Didn't have the noodles so just baked a couple potatoes and the broth on the potatoes was very good too. I liked this very much.

With the onions in the bottom, I added sauerkraut and jalapeno slices - we love things spicy and tangy around here. The roast was a hit and the sauerkraut with peppers was an awesome side dish.  Great recipe!

While this was cooking, the smell of the vinegar was very pungent.  Luckily, the end result tasted ok.  But if I make it again, I will definitely omit the vinegar.

Made this recipe exactly as written except I added a pinch of cloves to the mixture. It was delicious. My husband, my brother and my two nephews devoured it. I served it with baked potatoes, green beans and dinner rolls. A big hit!

I think this is the tenderest pork roast I've ever made.  I baked it in the oven for several hours at 350.  My son loved it and asked where I got the sauce and said it tasted like teriyaki.  I'm definitely saving this recipe.

First off, I'm not a pork person. However, I read the comments & decided to make it this evening. I loved it along with my family..I took one cup of the juices along with the onions & thickened it so it's a heavier gravy, & also had the juices for other family members who wanted that. Both were delicious. I was surprised that everyone commented how good it was. Tangy, sweet, absolutely scrumptious. You can use this recipe with anything you're making.

This recipe kept popping up in my e-mail (why so often?) so I thought it must be good.  I was wrong.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated and it just was not that good.  All I could taste was the vinegar!  I should have cooked the pork with sauerkraut instead of wasting a good piece of meat.  I have never found a recipe on here that I gave a bad review to.  This is my first.   Sorry.

This was fabulous! I followed the directions exactly and everyone just raved. I will have to try it with some vegetables in it. My husband insisted on saving the broth to make onion soup mix. He's usually the one who says, "It's good...next time you should..." but he just ranted. Thanks for sharing!!

This was really, really tasty and a huge hit with my husband and non-picky eaters. I did as others suggested and used dark brown sugar instead of white sugar. I also doubled the recipe (and double it again since I was cooking 4 lbs of roast). Super tasty!

I do have to agree with the other cooks to lighten up on the sweet stuff and double up on the seasonings. I also do HIGHLY RECOMMEND adding a can of condensed cream of mushroom to add thickness to the sauce. I cooked the pork on high for 3 hours and it turned out REALLY TENDER and tasty: serve over egg noodles tossed in carmelized onions in butter and you have a tasty winter dinner... If the sauce turns out too strong for your taste, then just slice up some french bread and butter the slices to readjust your taste buds : ) ENJOY!

The roast was tender after 7 hours on low in the slow cooker...that was the only good thing. And that would happen no matter what. The flavor in the sauce just don't compliment pork. Sorry. I won't make it again.

I had invited my girl friend over for supper, but at the time had no idea what I was going to fix.  Because of my work schedule I knew I needed something for the crock pot, and found this recipe the night before.  I fixed it straight up and it turned out great.  I did add carrots and quartered potatoes, and everything was done in 5.5 hours.  Homemade strawberry shortcake for dessert, and she was impressed.

Tasty. I made it as directed, except I used pork chops, subbed brown sugar for the white, and added a cubed Delicata squash. It was good, but I think next time I will use less vinegar and less sugar, and increase the seasonings. But my husband absolutely loved it as it was. The squash was a nice addition; it is naturally sweet so it meshed very well.

It was good but tasted like it was missing something. Next time I will add the potatoes and carrots into the crock pot. I'll rate it again then.

We seem to be in the minority, but we didn't really care fot this.  I felt the pork was very tender but bland.  I added carrots and potatoes per another reviewer's recommendation.

This was a great recipe.  Added the potatoes as others had recommended.  As we had left overs, on the next day we added a bottle of Bullseye BBQ Sauce after shredding the pork and removing the potatoes.  This made a yummy pulled pork.

This was ok.  Too much liquid and not very flavorful, probably because it was diluted from all the liquid.  Don't know what went wrong.  Won't make again.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I didn't put in as much sugar as called for and it was fine. Also I used apple cider vinegar as that is what I had on hand. Great recipe will use it again.

I thought this was very good.  I used a very large pork lion that I had cut in half.  Sasonings and liquid were right on. I used splenda instead of the sugar and added two teaspoons garlic powder to it to suit our tastes.

I had all the ingredients on hand except the tenderloin, which made this recipe easy and inexpensive. Next time I will put slits in the meat and stuff with garlic cloves. Maybe add some more hot sauce. I cooked the tenderloin two hrs. longer which made the meat soooo tender. I transformed this dish into pulled pork by shredding it and added barbeque sauce and had yummy pork on rolls. Thank you for the recipe.

I've made this twice now, and we loved it both times. I added potatoes and whole garlic cloves. I also went a little heavier on the spices. Next time my husband wants me to put carrots in it too.

Tender, with a subtle hint of the sauce flavors. However, an otherwise uninteresting dish. Will not plan on making again.

Excellent recipe!!!  I used a bone-in pork shoulder roast.  I didn't have red wine vinegar so I substituted raspberry vinegar.  For the liquid I used 1/2 cup hot water and 1/2 cup apple juice.  I don't know if that made it any different from the original recipe but it sure was a good gravy - served with mashed potatoes.

I added more of the 'wet' ingredients to taste, even added a tad more white sugar for the sweetness. I wanted it to be sweet and tangy. I also thickened the sauce with corn starch. Was a big hit with everyone!

This was a first class recipe. Meat was tender and greavy was tasty. I used Pork fillet and red wine instead of vinegar. It leaves a lot more taste and is less sour. I used much more pepper instead of soy sauce and pepper sauce. I added mushrooms and green peppers. Served it on basmati rice. Wonderful summer sunday lunch! Will definately cook this again.

Easy and simple...great flavor!  I use stir-fry sauce instead of soy and also add sriachra sauce too for some kick.  (I use Splenda and not sugar). I double the liquid so I have plenty for gravy.  I get compliments on this always and requests to make this all the time.  Thanks for the recipe!!

My pork loin turned out to be country-style pork ribs (freezer mislabel) but went ahead with the recipe.  I too had to use balsamic vinegar but the ribs turned out so nicely and tasty too!  The sauce was yummy with all the onions. I was a little disappointed that it didn't cook down more.  My husband didn't even put barbecue sauce on them.  I'll be fixing this again but with a pork loin next time!

Absoutely wonderful! The roast was perfect, fall-off-the bone delicious, and moist! My hubby and son loved it, and asked me to always make pork roast this way!  I cooked 3 hrs on high, and 1 hr on low.  I used bone-in that was larger than what was called for, as that was what I had.  I read a number of reviews that said the sauce was too sweet, but I think that really depends on taste.  I actually added a bit more ketchup, to give it more of a bbq taste.  I used apple cider vinegar, as well, as I did not have the wine vinegar.  My son wanted to make sure I "thanked" the person who posted the recipe. :)

This is a good classic recipe. I used the suggestion to put potatoes in the bottom of the slow-cooker. However, next time I will poke holes the pork and put the potatoes on top. I think this will give the pork more flavor.

Wonderful recipe! I made it just as the recipe called for except I used apple cider vinegar and it got rave reviews from the hubby. I had my cousin visiting and after dinner he called home and I overheard him tell his wife that she should ask me for the recipe.

I LOVE this recipe.  I made it exactly as printed.  I then pulled it apart, put it inside my homemade whole wheat hamburger buns, and put some Sweet Baby Ray's Barbecue Sauce on it.

I made this as written, except I put two dashes of hot sauce and it still wasn't the least bit spicy hot. I put it together the night before, so it had marinated overnight except that the sauce didn't totally cover the meat.  I turned the roast over so the other side would be in the sauce while it cooked, and then cooked it on low all day. I thought it turned out just the right amount of sweet.  The meat was falling apart tender and flavorful.  I will definitely make this again and again. I think next time I would throw in some carrots too.

This is delicious and so, so easy.  I don't cook pork very often but this one is a definite keeper. I followed the recipe exactly as is... loved, loved it.  Thanks

Moist and tasty, though not very different from other recipes I've tried.  I poked it through with a knife several times to let the flavor in; I used 2 T white vinegar and 1 T apple juice instead of red wine vinegar; added 1 beef bouillon cube.  Served with green beans and buttered rice.   I'll use the leftover meat for bbq pork sandwiches.

Excellent! I added some veggies (potatoes and carrots) in with the meat. I overdid the "dash" of hot sauce, next time I'll be a little more careful. Definitely a keeper!

This is a very easy recipe and my family enjoyed it. We did add some sliced yellow onion, placed under the roast, and surrounded the roast with quartered carrots and potatoes. I also added about 1/2 tsp of dry mustard and used brown sugar instead of white. I also made a gravy from the sauce by adding some water and cornstarch. I would suggest bumping up the amount of spices to give it more zing.

I didn't get to have any but my family said it was pretty good.  They did say that it was a little sweet.  Maybe next time I'll put less of the sweet stuff in and hope I'll get to try it!  Thanks!

Yummy!  This was great.  I added a little extra on the garlic salt, salt and pepper and then I threw in a about 1 Tbs of worchestershire sauce for a little extra kick.

This was very good for pork roast.  My family does not like pork roast, but we were given one.  I would not make this again....  unless I am given another pork roast.  I did double the sauce and added 1" cubed potatoes to the pot for 30 min.  The potatoes were GREAT.  With double the amount of sauce, I thought that there was just enough.  The meat was good...kids ate it :-)

WOW this recipe tops any pork loin recipe I've tried or had. I didn't change a thing and the meat was tender fall apart. This would be perfect as pulled pork barbecue but still shines all by its self. I only used a mid sized sweet onion, next time I'll use an extra large or 2 mediums. My kids couldn't get enough. I served with my homemade mac and cheese and peas.

This was very easy to make, I was in a rush this morning and was happy to see I had all the ingredients for the marinade and that it'd be all done in 8hr by 6pm! Kids thought it was a bit bland but still good, but a little bit more salt afterwards worked for them.

Flavor was good.  I added some vegetables so I increased some of the spices to compensate and it turned out well.  The pork was tender and it was a hit with the family.  The leftovers are being used for sandwiches which are handy.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

The only good thing I can say is that the pork was very tender.  Otherwise, there was not a lot of flavor to the dish.  I even added extra seasoning per other people's suggestions. It also took closer to 5 hours on high setting, and I only had a 2lb roast.  I won't be making this one again.  Sorry! =(

This is the best tasting, slow cooker pork roast recipe I have ever found, I also add a little thicker version of this sauce to pour on top while it cooks and it bakes on it like ketchup does to meatloaf! Yummy recipe, my family thanks you!

I followed the marinade recipes exactly, poked holes in the pork loin with a fork and let it sit overnight in the fridge. I was cooking a large amount of meat, so i cooked it in the pven instead on 350 until tender (3 hours?). I did throw in some carrots and cut up yukon gold potatoes. I served this at a family gathering and had to give out several copies of the recipe. The meat was tender, juicy and sligtly sweet. I will definately make this again.

The sauce was good, after doubling the seasonings as was mentioned in other reviews, but the roast ended up dry.  It was tender, but not at all juicy.

Followed recipe exactly and flavor was just o.k.  It was really good the next day.  I pulled it apart and added barbecue sauce and served on sandwiches.  My family didn't even know that they were eating the same thing.

Very good.  I followed the recipe exactly for the sauce and then adjusted to my taste, ultimately adding more of everything except the sugar.  I also used fresh garlic in the adjustment.  It came out very nice, though a bit dry for me - perhaps I'll shorten the cooking time next time.  My family of four ate almost the entire roast, and hubby took the leftovers with him to work.  I'll definitely make again, but I'll double the onions as they were wonderful(!).

SO SO SO delicious!  Can't say enough good things about this recipe.  I've fixed it 3 times and my family (including my very picky 9yr old daughter) love it.  Even better the 2nd day.  I shred it with two forks and serve it and put some good bbq sauce on the table for those who want to add it.  My inlaws rave about it when I serve it to them!  Thanks sooo much!

I have made this recipe a few times and it always turns out good. The "gravy" is tasty with rice. It's a keeper.

Hard to rate as directed because we changed a few things - was delicious with our changes, but didn't do it as the recipe stated.  1) cut the sugar in half and used brown sugar 2) used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar 3) used pork tenderloin as that was what was in our freezer 4) Used two onions, one cooking and one vidalia 5) added two potatoes - sliced thick.  This was so good - my husband put it together for me as I was already at work when I found the recipe.  Was delicious with rice!  Nicely done!

This was incredible! My family loved it! I used just a pinch of salt and low- sodium soy sauce and I thought it was perfect. We poured the sauce over the pork on our plates.  It was delicious!

This is so easy and really tasty! I seasoned the pork with Everglades seasoning before adding the sauce mixture to the crock pot. My roast was done in about 6 hours so I left it on warm and it still turned out very moist. I also added a little cornstarch to the liquid after removing the meat to thicken it up a bit. Very yummy sauce!

This is so easy!  My family loved it!  They requested that I put it in my regular rotation of meals.  I used the juices out of the crock pot as the base for my gravy.  The sugar made it a little sweet but still very good.

MMMmmm...  I used apple cider vinegar and a few tablespoons of salsa instead of the ketchup and this was really great.  Sause and roast was great over rice!  My 13 year old son couldn't get enough.  Very tangy and flavorfull recipe!

We loved it!  I put the leftovers back in the crockpot, and cooked over night.  We had shredded pork sandwiches the next day!  I started with a frozen bone in pork and it only took 5hours on high!  Very great!

It was just ok.  My husband and I both agree, just too sweet and had an odd twang to it. Dont know if it was the soy sauce or the red wine vinegar.  We agreed we wouldnt be making this again.

Very good, but it did seem a little dry.  there was plenty of liquid in the slow cooker and the roast had a good flavor, i guess im just not used to pork.

This was very good.  I ended up cooking it in the oven due to a crock pot malfunction.  I just use my probe thermometer & cooked it to 160 degrees F.

Also I used brown sugar instead of white sugar because I prefer the flavor of the brown.

Excellent and quick recipe!

Followed the recipe to the letter and it was excellent.  Pork roast is often dry -this was mosit and juicy.  My 16 year old son who is usually not too fond of roast indicated that I need to make this dish more often.  We are havng leftovers tonight, but thickened the juice with a little cornstarch to make more of a gravy to serve over rice.

Excellent! Tender, moist and flavorful without overpowering the pork. I substituted chicken broth for the water and fresh garlic for the powder.

My husband and I really liked this roast.  I thickened the liquids and made a gravy but it was a bit too sweet for our tastes.  The meat was very tender and tasty though.

This was excellent! I think it is the best pork roast slow cooker on here. 
I put the pork in the crock pot and made the sauce, accidently omitting the vinegar and water (I was in a huge hurry). I rubbed the sauce into the pork and I then went to work. I got a call a about 2 hours later and was told the pork seemed a little dry so I walked a friend how to make the sauce and this time she added the vinegar, poured it over the roast and it was fine. 
Another friend came in from work, tasted it and his eyes rolled back in his head, he started saying "Oh yeah, yummm" and high fived me several times. 
Needless to say this recipe is a keeper and will be made often.

I didn't have wine vinegar so used white vinegar instead. Still turned out good and very moist. It fell apart tender. I will use this again.

This was sooo good.  I took others advice and used brown sugar instead.  I also used a videla onion which was really what made this extra delicious in my opinion.  I'm making it again tonight for dinner!  Oh yeah, I also put a little cornstarch to thicken it up a bit.

MY wife and I both enjoyed this very much.  I did use chicken stock instead of water and added carrots & bell pepper.
Served over rice with garlic bread. I've only been cooking for about eighteen months since my wife had an accident. Easy recipes like this make my life a lot easier.

Yum. Got a big thumbs up from DH too which says something. I did use brown sugar instead of white and left out the hot sauce (personal preference). Will definitely make again.

This is a winner in my household.  I wouldn't change a thing either, however, I may go with a previous suggestion and do sandwiches with BBQ sauce.....  Thank you, thank you, thank you!

Thought is was great, husband and kids enjoyed it.  I didn't have egg noodles so I used ziti instead, just as good. Next time I think I will add some peppers and more onion maybe even some potatoes.

4 Stars because the meat just fell apart it was so tender! However, it did not have a great amount of flavor.  If looking for a good, dependable recipe this is one, just not big on flavor, though all in the family enjoyed a mildly tasty meal.

Today was a raw New England Spring day so I decided to take the slow cooker out once again. I Googled Crock Pot Pork Roast recipes and up came this recipe. WOW!!! 

THIS IS ABSOLUTELY THE MOISTEST, SWEETEST PORK ROAST I'VE EVER MADE. YUMMY! 

I even cooked snap peas and rice to go with it. I'm ready for dinner. 

Thanks Allrecipes.com for making my life so easy.

This was absolutely delicious.  The sweetness is subtle but different and so good.  The roast came out so tender.  This is absolutely going into the rotation.  I don't think I'll make a pork roast any other way again!

This was very good and very moist (which is always tricky with pork roasts).  The next night I shredded the leftovers and simmered in bbq sauce for pulled pork sandwiches - delicious!

This was a very tasty recipe. It was very easy to make. The house smelled wonderful. My husband and daughter loved it. My husband enjoyed the leftovers. Next time I will add some BBQ sauce to make BBQ pork sandwiches. Will make again:)

This was really good. Even the onions at the bottom of the slow cooker were yummy! I think next time, I'll add a bit more seasoning on the roast.. some salt and pepper, maybe up the garlic a bit. Thanks! :)

AWESOME! 
I followed the direction exactely.  I made this with jar red cabbage, and potato dumplings.  I did cheat with the dumplings I used Panni potato dumplings in a box.  The directions call for 2 cups of water, I added 1 cup chicken broth and 1 cup water (delicious). I will make this again and again.  Thank you

I made this recipe exactly as stated except I left out the hot pepper sauce and my husband, son and I all loved it. It came out moist and very tender. I am going to do as other reviewers have suggested and use the leftovers for BBQ pork sandwiches. YUM!

Pretty good although not as flavorful as I thought it would be. I didn't have red wine vinegar so I used apple cider vinegar, so I cut the sugar to 2 Tbsp.  The potatoes and carrots that I cooked with it came out good too!

This was fabulous!  I used a pork loin end roast and teriyaki instead of soy - I was out of that.  Leftovers make great pulled pork sandwiches with barbecue sauce!

Pretty good... i will make this again because its just so easy and pretty tasty. I added potatoes and baby carrots to the roast as well. They tasted great! We ate the pork with BBQ  sauce and applesauce, it was alittle to bland on its own, but pretty yummy dinner overall.

The flavor of the outer layer of the roast was good, but it didn't penetrate the whole pork line very well.  Next time I'll use a flavor injector to inject the cooking mixture into the roast before cooking.

Good recipe, but next time I wont use NEAR as much sugar. It washed out the other "tangy" flavors, I thought my roast actually came out sweet.

I am givng this a 4 only because I thought it was dry, but my husband thought it was great!  I may have over cooked it in the slow cooker, I got a smaller pork and cooked it for the same amount of time.  It was great though, it had a great taste,  I will do this one again!

Awesome!  I had company coming, so I took the largest roast I could find and increased most of the ingredients by 50%.  The roast was wonderful after cooking at low for about 10 hours.  This is probably the best roast I've ever made.

I used a pork loin.  I have never like pork loin either, but my family does, so I was making it for them.  Once I tasted it, I realized that this was amazing!!!!  We all loved it & we will have it again in the future.  Thanks!

Not sure what I did wrong... maybe it's because it was the first time I ever used a slow cooker??.. I didn't really like this recipe. My boyfriend loved it! I will try it again once I become more of an expert with the slow cooker

I was a little disappointed in how this turned out.  The meat was all right, but the sauce was a little too sweet for my taste. I made gravy out of it, but the flavor just wasn't right for gravy. I ended up serving with barbecue sauce, which covered up any taste from the sauce. It wasn't really worth the bother for me and next time I'll just dump barbecue sauce over it while it cooks.

My daughter loved this one so much she asked me to make it again the next night!  I didn't have red wine vinegar so I used balsamic vinegar instead which left a little more vinegar taste than I like, but next time I will make sure I have the right vinegar in the pantry.  Was quick and easy to make so will be making this one again soon.

I thought this was okay.  Oddly, it was way too salty for me even though I usually like a lot of salt.  My husband really enjoyed this recipe, which is why I have given it four stars.  I'll only make this again if he requests it.

Made just as written.  Very good.  Meat was moist and tender.  Cooked 6 hours on low, being cautious not to overcook.  I hate dry pork.  I would try to thicken the sauce next time, as it was thin.

Nice flavor. I did double the sauce ingredients except for the water and then only added an additional 1/2 cup. I didn't have the boneless pork loin roast, and instead, used pork tri tip. I will be making this again.

This was great! I'm diabetic so I replaced the sugar with granular Splenda, used low sodium soy sauce and reduced calorie ketchup. I made the kind of broccoli and cauliflower that comes in a steamer bag and whole grain rice in a packet that goes in the micro for 90 seconds. We poured the yummy liquid over the pork, veggies and rice. What an easy and delicious meal. Thanks K.

We found this recipe kind of bland. The meat was tender but not much flavor. If I were to make it again I think I would use a injector needle and infuse the meat with the sauce before cooking.

I used boneless pork chops instead of a roast and added diced potatoes which turned out really well, the meat was tender but I wish I would've heeded others' advice and cut down on the water. I will make it again, with half of the water so it has a little more taste.

Good roast. The juice in the bottom is the bonus: you can thicken it and use it as a gravy or eat it as is and it's a wonderful onion soup!

OK.. It would help if I read the directions right... I cooked it on High for 6 hours instead of on low and it came out EXTREMELY dry.. the gravy was the only thing that saved it. Taste wise it was pretty good... it didn't "WOW" me but everyone seemed to like it, including the picky kids... I did add carrots to the bottem and I doubled everything except the sugar like others suggested and I didn't have red wine vinegar so I used 1 tbs of red cooking wine and 2 tbs of reg vinegar. This was an easy recipe and I'm going to make it again. Next time though, I'm going to read the directions right! :)

This recipe was very good.  I did not change anything other then adding baby carrots to the slow cooker and they were great!  I will make this again, since there was so much gravy I would make it with mashed potatoes as a side next time!

The meat was tender, though it wasn't falling apart, and it was tasty and delicious, though it wasn't anything spectaculor to where I'd make it again or pass on the recipe.  Good, yes, something to write home about, no.

This was ok.  No one really went wild for it at our house.  It didn't have much flavor.  I wouldn't make this again.  The only good thing about it was that I had all the ingredients on hand so that made it easy.

I made this pork roast for Easter lunch and it was perfect. The meat was moist and went perfect with our mashed potatoes and sauteed fresh spinach. It's super simple to put together and the leftovers are yummy too!

Yum - I used 2 medium onions and a small bag of baby carrots, as well as 1/2  brown and 1/2 white sugar.  I also used the full amount of water but threw in about 1/2 tsp. of chicken base - kept everything else the same.  8 hours on low and I had perfectly tender, moist pork.  Added cornstarch to the gravy to thicken up a bit and served over egg noodles.  Really good, but I think there is a little room for improvement... not sure what would help.  But the carrots were a fantastic addition, I highly recommend.  Leftovers made great pulled-pork sandwiches too!

This was only ok for us. I'm not sure where the tangy part came in at because all I tasted was the sugary sweetness of it. And I don't think that went very well with the flavor of the pork. However, sometimes I feel that it all depends on the cook and the pans used as to how well a dish turns out.

This was really good!  I used a 3.25# roast & doubled the sauce (which if I was using a 2# roast I don't think I would of done).  Next time I'll make sure to cook on low and start checking the temp @ about 3 hours into the cook time.  I sprinkled some herbs de provence (sp?)on top of the roast & thickened the juice with a little cornstarch.

Fantastic recipe!  I followed the recipe exactly and after it was done cooking, I sliced the pork and put it on French rolls to make the best pork sandwiches.  I will definitley make this again.

I found that 1 cup of water was way too much. I did like the flavor, but it seemed a little weak. I think next time I will double everything, but reduce the water to 1/2 cup.

I used beef broth, brown sugar, fresh mushrooms, and fresh garlic and the taste was good.  However, pork loin is too lean for the slow cooker.  It came out very dry.  I saved it by thickening the liquid with corn starch which made a good sauce.  Would make again but not with loin, maybe a Boston butt.

Excellent recipe - thanks a lot for sharing.

I doubled the sauce as I had a fairly large roast.  I substituted Splenda for sugar and found that next time I'm not going to double the sugar - maybe 1.5 because it was a bit on the sweet side.  I used Hot Ketchup (and threw in an extra tablespoon) and a very generous squirt of the hot sauce.  Both of us liked the recipe a lot.  Slow Cookers make things so easy!

This is very yummy!  My husband does not care for pork, but said I could make this anytime!  I add baby carrots to cook with the meat, make a thicker gravy with the sauce and serve over brown rice...my 4,2 and 1 year old love it as well.

Very tasty - unfortunately, I cooked it too long 12 hr instead of 10hr - came out tender but a little dry - my fault. Threw in fresh pearl onions, carrot, red pepper, green pepper  - very nice...

Easy recipe to prep.  The flavor absorbs in the onions.  This works nicely for a family with picky eaters since you are able to serve them separately.  The pork had a mild flavor but very moist.

I wouldnt call this recipe excellent but it is better than good. so gave it a four star.

next time I make this I am going to try taking the broth and adding a little starch to little it up just a little and then pouring it over the meat when it is served.

Loved this! Hubby loved this! The only thing I am going to try next time is to us less sugar and one more onion. It was awesome with the snow peas and egg noodles. I was nervous about the tabasco sauce, but it was a complex and good flavor.

OK...this was soooooo easy and very tasty! I added a little liquid smoke and a small can of green chile sauce for a little kick. Also thickened the sauce with a little flour. It was delicious! Served it with black beans and yellow rice! YUMMY!!!! Leftovers made great sandwiches!

Too wonderful for words, I've made it several times.  Don't use hot sauce (because I never have any) or garlic powder and substitute any vinegar I have.  Towards the end I add cornstarch to thicken the sauce.

This roast was absolutely delicious and the onions came out carmelized - which was a huge plus with my hubby!!  Definitely will make again and again!!

I was expecting more "tang" from this recipe. The meat was very, very tender but the sauce didn't seem to flavor the meat much. I ended up straining the juices, stirring in a packet of dry onion soup mix, thickening it to make a gravy and then returning the shredded (very well done) meat to the crockpot with the gravy until serving time. With these changes, the recipe was quite good served over potatoes. A good basic recipe for "doctoring" up to suit your own family's tastes.

This is a great recipe.  Even my anti-tangy husband loved it.  Makes a nice juicy roast with some real kick to it.

Great recipe. Even my son who isn't a "meat eater" liked it. Very Fast and Easy to make. Served it over sticky white rice and had mixed veggies on the side. Will be making this one again!

Very good!  We served this with sauerkraut and mashed potatoes (the PA Dutch influence of my hometown).  We're now thinking maybe this will work with chicken or beef.

This was good.  Cooked for 8 hours, will cook a less next time.  Was a little dry.  Followed recipe exactly.  Will try this again using chicken broth and carrots as others suggested.

Delicious and easy for the nights I work and the poor family have to fend for themselves. I used to buy a package of seasoning reminiscent of this but this is so much tastier and really just as easy once you add all of the wet ingredients. Good one!!

This was a pretty good pork roast but for some reason there was an aftertaste to it. Maybe it was the vinegar. Next time I may omit that.

My family loved this recipe. I did do as others sugessted I used chicken broth. I put in fresh mushrooms. I also tripled the sauce except sugar. I think next time I would only double. My picky 10 year old ate two helpings that never happens he said he loved the sauce. I didn't use hot sauce only because I didn't have. I will use this again.

My family really enjoyed this one!  I used chicken broth (replacing the water as suggested); didn't have a large onion so I used pearl onions. I also used freeze-dried garlic sprinkled over the meat (rather than garlic salt). Very flavorful.  My husbands wants to add more hot sauce next time.  Great over rice!

Recipe was good, fell apart easily. My husband didn't find it seasoned well enough.  I did add additional hot sauce as others had commented, and used cornstarch to make a gravy. I will make it again, but add more seasoning.

This was very good my family really enjoyed it.  The meat however was a bit dry, it could have been because I sliced it and let is sit for a few minutes.  The gravy was fantastic I kept it thin and it worked well with spaetzle instead of noodles.   My husband requested it again and this time we are going to shred it for sandwiches.

This recipe could not have been easier to make. I followed the recipe pretty closely, with the exception of using a little more water than called for. The juice turned out a bit thin, but that was ok with us. The pork was so tender and moist, and very tasty. I will definitely make this again.

Pretty good recipe. I used a pre-stuffed roast. The meat was a little dry at the edge but tender in the middle. Maybe basting more often will help this? Also, I did not really care for the sauce. I will have to try adding mushroom gravy mix or the like and using less vinegar the next time I make this. Thanks K.

Tasty, fast & easy...would give 5 stars, but despite the different ingredients, still tastes like most crock pot recipes.  Delicious though...the kids loved it.. and the gravy I made with the juices.

This recipe has potential, but I found the meat didn't have enough flavor.  Maybe the meat needs to marinate and needs more spices?  Or brown the roast before putting it in the slow cooker.  My family said it was OK, they weren't impressed.  Sorry, probably won't make this again.

The roast turned out nice and moist (nothing new when using a slow cooker), but we wanted more flavor from the sauce.  I served it with buttered egg noodles and canned italian green beans.

This was good, but a little too vinegry and plain for us. Will keep trying for a slow-cooker pork recipe.

Excellent meal.  I Tried this using pork tenderloin and added shallots to the recepie.  The outcome was delicous.  I will be making this again, and at least once a month.

Even my kids liked this. I trimmed all visible fat from the roast and used about 8 dashes of Tabasco sauce. The onions turned out so carmelized and delicious!

This was pretty good.  For some reason though, whenever I make bonless port loin roast, they always turn out a little on the dry side, even when I don't cook them as long as the recipe says.

WOW!  This was TERRIFIC!  I used a pork shoulder roast which was 5 1/2 lbs.  Based on other's reviews, the only thing I did different was QUADRUPLE the liquid (except for the sugar which I just doubled) so that it would cover the roast.  It did and the roast cooked to perfection.  This was a yummy sour concoction which will definitely be made over and over!  THANKS!!!

Three stars means "ok, we ate it, but would not make again".  I did modify the recipe, but I used suggestions from other reviewers, so not sure what went wrong.  Used chops instead of roast,  honey instead of soy sauce, brown sugar instead of white.  Had to use cornstarch to thicken sauce.  Sauce kind of tasted like apples.  Guess it was a little too sweet for us - probably soy sauce would've helped and maybe some more hot sauce.  One good thing - the pork was very tender - no knife needed and was done in about 5 hours (stared with frozen chops!)

Flavour was excellent.  Meat was just falling off the bone.  Will definitely make again!

I use this recipe with pork chops instead of a roast and serve the thickened sauce over rice. We really like it- it's got a different taste to it than what we normally eat so it's a nice change!

great flavor - not too tangy, and i doubled the liquid like others suggested, good idea... used the leftover juices, added them to a pan that had flour/butter cooking in it, and voila- perfect gravy!!  excellent recipe!

Tasted good however cooking time took a lot longer then stated.  I had it in my slow cooker on high for 6 hours.  Also, doubled the marinade as suggested by another review - and added quartered potatoes at the beginning.

Crock pot recipes that taste good are hard to find but this roast was excellent.  Very quick and easy to prepare in the morning.  I made it yesterday for my hubby and kids and they liked it, too.  A definite keeper!

This was pretty good, but I was expecting more of a barbeque flavor (looking at the recipe a second time I'm not sure why I thought that). I doubled the sauce and marinated it overnight. I'll probably try it again.

This recipe was a huge success with my entire family!  It isn't easy finding something that my husband and three children all like!  It was fork tender and my four year old even asked for a third helping!
