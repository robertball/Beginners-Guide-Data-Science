This works well in the cast iron skillet though I do use quite a bit more butter than what's called for in the recipe. My kids also like this with marshmallow creme.

Was looking for something quick and melted chocolatey. I made this in a pan, as I don't have a panini press. I would recommend dipping the bread slices into the melted butter and sprinkling brown sugar on the outsides of the slices, to give it a touch of extra sweetness. I found it to be just sweet enough, so I don't know how it would've been, had I not added that. Perhaps I could've put more chocolate, instead, but I didn't want it to overflow, and found it to be the perfect consistency, as is. This recipe has a very interesting flavor-- peanut butter and chocolate lovers should definitely give it a try!
