I thought these were pretty good. The only complaint really that I had was that it did not make enough gravy. I even added double the cornstarch and chicken broth, but it was just not enough and the gravy tasted so good. I think also that the next time I would add equal parts water and chicken broth while braising. It would add more flavor to the pork and also add more gravy. I will make them again though. Very easy...

I would suggest switching the chicken broth and the water - braising in the broth and mixing the cornstarch with the water.  Other than that, I thought this was a perfect mix of seasonings and a fast and delicious way to prepare pork. I also tripled the amount so I'd have lots of tasty gravy.

Oh my goodness....this recipe is excellent. The pork chops are so tender and flavorful. I didn't change a single thing with this recipe and it is now one of my favorite pork chop recipes. Even my fussy husband likes it.

Wow - my husband LOVED this recipe.  I used extra fresh marjoram, fresh garlic and onion, and fresh ground pepper- all crushed into a paste in a molchajete.  Braised in chicken broth with a touch of white wine (moscato) for extra flavor along with a few sliced up mushrooms.  Used the remaining pan juices and mushrooms to top the chops - rather than making gravy.  It was mouthwatering!  Hubby said it was better than any pork chop he ever tasted in any restaurant.  YUM!  :)

This was delicious.  I didn't have onion powder, so I used a small chopped onion instead.  It was good.  When you make the gravy towards the end, the onions really put it together.  Also, I didn't have any cornstarch.  I used all-purpose flour and it worked just fine.  We used boneless pork chops too, it worked just fine!

This was very good.  I did add some rosemary to the spice mixture and I braised the chops in chicken stock and tripled the gravy mix.  For the gravy I mixed 1/2 cup of chicken stock with 1/4 cup water and 4 tsp of cornstarch and it tasted perfect.  I served over stuffing with the gravy on top along with a salad and steamed corn.  I will def make again.

This is a great low cal recipe.  You get the feeling of a comfort food because of the bit of gravy on the meat, yet it is still a nicely low cal dish.  I would add a bit of salt to the gravy for my taste, but I left the recipe as is because my husband has a heart condition.  It was still tasty.

These pork chops were great!  I let simmer for about the 40 minute mark and they were perfect and moist.  If you want extra of the delicious gravy for mashed potatoes or rice then quadruple the ingredients.  It's really good gravy.  I also used chicken stock for the water.  Thanks!

FINALLY I have mastered the moist pork chop!!! This recipe is easy and yummy. I used boneless 2 inch pork loin chops that I cut in half (as suggested by my hubby since I can't EVER after 23 years make a moist pork chop!). I didn't measure the dry ingredients and used garlic salt instead of garlic powder. I browned the chops in 2 TBS of EVOO and 2 TBS butter and did not make the gravy. Still delicious!!! The key is to sear them first, then simmer covered for only a few minutes, then turn off the pan, as the meat will still cook once the heat is turned off. Hubby says these were the BEST chops I have ever made! AH-MAZING!

I had my doubts about cooking pork chops for 45-60 minutes, but I thought I'd still give them a try.  Though I followed the recipe to a tee, I have to say that these were dry and hard to chew.

Only 4 stars ONLY because I felt it REALLY needed salt...though I know the intention originally was salt-free.  But this was SOOOO easy and turned out delicious!  Great comfort food meal.  We served it with roasted brussel sprouts and Garlic Cheese Bisquits from this site.  :)

I have to start eating better so I decided to try this one. Other folks are right, the chops were VERY moist! Didn't have any marjoram, and next time I'll use less pepper (we're not keen on too much) - and I did use all chicken broth. I think I may add some mushrooms or even onions to the saute next time, but it's going into the rotation!

Good Recipe...The meat melts in your mouth.  The only thing I found wrong was that the sauce was a little runny.  Next time I will add more cornstarch.  My family loved it.

This was very good.  I also braised in the chicken broth and doubled the garlic powder, pepper and onion powder and no marjoram.   I braised for about 30 minutes.  I had boneless pork chops that were over an inch thick, and even then, they were slightly overcooked.  I didn't make the gravy but tossed in mushrooms and it was very flavorful.  I'll make it again and watch the cooking time more closely.

Decent recipe.  The flavor was good, but as always, my prok chops were a little dry.  I cooked them about 50 minutes so maybe I need to go a little less next time.  The gravy was tasty though, and helped the dryness with the chops.  I had to separate into two pans though, because I don't have a pan large enough for 4 chops, which means I put 1/2 cup of water in each pan and then doubled the amount of gravy, which I am glad I did because we used almost all of it!

Everyone except my almost vegetarian daughter loved it. She did like the gravy on her potatoes though. I added more broth and cornstarch to make more gravy since my family are big gravy eaters.

I love this recipe so so much! I did tweak it a bit though: reversed the water and broth amounts, added 1-2 chopped onions (while the chops are simmering with the lid on), and added tarragon- it's my favorite herb! The chops always come out juicy and the gravy is super flavorful! 
Thank you for submitting this great recipe!

Very easy and very delicious.  I did follow other reviewers' recommendations to cook in broth and use water/cornstarch mix.  I had boneless thin-cut pork chops, and adjusted the time accordingly.  Enjoyed the gravy over rice.

I agree with some of the reviewers, my pork chop turned out not as tender as I would have liked. I think the cooking time could be reduced. I added just a few red pepper flakes in the sauce at the end for some ZAP. May I suggest serving with garlic mashed potatoes and boiled broccoli. After the broccoli is done, drizzle with olive oil, red wine vinegar and salt and pepper. This goes nicely with the pork chop. I think the sause was VERY tasty!

These were pretty good - not spectacular, but fine for a no-fuss dinner. I am glad I followed the advice of others and used more liquid; also, I used all chicken stock and no water. The only other difference is that I used dried oregano in place of the marjoram, but they are similar in flavor. The sauce turned out very nicely.

The pork chops were good because they were tender, but it seemed a little bland.  Maybe we need to try doubling the spices.  We did pair it with a Sauerkraut Salad recipe found on this sight and the flavors together were wonderful!

this recipe was easy and delicious! I got thin chops so they cooked faster. I didn't have much time to cook. I follow suggestion to braise using broth instead of water. I used beef broth, very tasty. I added sliced onions and used Wondra with the water later to finish sauce.  Everyone enjoyed it! Thanks

This was delicious! I was looking for a way to cook pork chops without breading, and this was a winner. We used 7 thin-sliced boneless chops, cooked per the directions, then braised them in the crock pot with double the water and about a 1/2 cup of Riesling. Per another reviewer I added rosemary, and doubled the amount of spices. The gravy didn't turn out too great, but this was also my first time making gravy so maybe next time will be better. Thanks Shirley for the recipe!

I made this dish last night. I didn't have dried marjoram so I used ground. I'm not sure if that made any difference but,the pork chops were flavorless and quite tough. Even though I did not care for them, my son seemed to have enjoyed them with a ton of hot sauce. I doubt I'll try this one again.

I don't know if I accidentally entered a rating twice for this recipe, but I give it five stars because it tasted great. I used a slightly thicker pork chop, which I cooked longer, and I used dried minced garlic as I had no garlic powder on hand. I also made more gravy, and I used xanthan gum instead of cornstarch to reduce carbs. We had the pork chops and served the gravy over the chops and some mashed cauliflower, and it was delicious low-carb comfort food! This recipe is a keeper.

Fabulous recipe! I did as one reviewer suggested and swapped the measurements for the water and the broth. It did get more flavor but, even though I do not mind salt (and I used low-sodium broth) my husband and I found it a bit salty. Next time I try this, I will probably try equal parts water and broth. I also love gravy, and made extra. We will definitely be eating this again- especially my extremely picky 4-year-old, who emphatically called me "a good cooker."

this recipe produced the most tender pork chops ever! this will go in my menu rotation. like some, i omitted water in place of chicken stock for simmering. i added some chopped onion and garlic, some coarse ground pepper. i also sprinkled with a bit of paprika just for the color. husband and kids remarked on the tenderness and the gravy was divine!i doubled the gravy based on others suggestions. served with mashed potatoes, green beans, cheese biscuits. thanks for a wounder recipe!

flavor is GREAT!  However, they are a bit tough & chewy.   A Pork chop recipe that can turn out tender  pork chops is a true find!
I followed recipe just used fresh onion and garlic instead of the powders.
