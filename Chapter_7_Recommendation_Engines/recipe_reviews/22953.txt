Ok folks, this cake will put you in chocolate heaven.  Have tried many recipes from this site and this one wins by a landslide.  To be objective, I made this to the T the first time. It was fantastic.  Moist, dark, rich.  But after that, I've been using buttermilk in place of regular milk and used cake flour instead of regular flour (same amount) and the cake was super moist. I've learned when it comes to baking, using buttermilk where a recipe calls for milk makes everything more moist and fluffy.  If Cake Flour is available, use. Be sure to add 2 extra tablespoons of cake flour for every cup of regular flour. The cake flour made it extra light and tender.  No need for vinegar if using buttermilk. The 'sour' in buttermilk reacts with the leavening agents - baking powder/soda - which makes the cake rise and moist.  I've also increased cocoa to 1 full cup & added 2 extra tablespoon sugar when I do, for a devils food style cake.  And forget all the 'multi-bowl cake recipes'.  This is so easy in prep and clean-up.  Too good to be true, but it is.  I usually bake mine in a 10" bundt (cooking time appx. 38-40 min.) or two 9" cake pans (25 min.).  When making a layer cake, try frosting it with German Chocolate Frosting II (from this site) for ultimate decadence.  You will get raves for this - even you first time bakers can't get this wrong. Update - Drizzle this with Chocolate Ganache - superb.

This cake is absolutely to die for. I have gotten rave reviews. I used some of the suggestions of others. I used buttermilk instead of vinegar and milk. I added a cup of chocolate chips last thing to the batter. I cooked it for 45 minutes at 325 degrees.Oh and for those of you who have had troubles with it falling in the middle....your cake was not done befor you moved it. Just open the oven (DO NOT MOVE THE WIRE RACKS AT ALL)when it looks done and lightly press the top side of the cake (not right in the middle) with your finger. If it feels like anything other than firm cake quickly close the oven again and let it bake for at least another 10 to 15 min., especially if you are cooking it at the lower temp. Mine fell slightly the first time due to this issue. The second time I tested it first and it came out beautiful. I also made it in two foil lined round spring form pans. I lined it with reynolds non stick heavy duty foil and it just peeled right off even though this was a really sticky cake. I made this with dark chocolate cocoa. It was fabulous. For those who like to make this all in one bowl...just start with all the wet ingredients, mixing after each addition, and work your way backwards through the recipe with the flour and chocolate chips being the last ingredients. This way you know that your soda and powder are completely disoved and there will be no bitter spots.

This cake is dark, rich, moist and boldly chocolate.  So easy to mix up even a cave man could do it - no creaming, sifting, adding eggs one at a time, etc.  Best yet, it's such a perfect recipe you can prepare it confidently just as is - nothing you could do to this would improve it. I used this for cupcakes and because the batter was so thin I was able to pour it into the cupcake tins fast, easily and neatly. Baked up nicely in about 20 minutes at 350 degrees.  I frosted them with my own vanilla buttercream recipe and they were decadent.  Thank goodness for the predetermined portion control of cupcakes, because it would be very easy to overindulge with this one!

This cake was delicious! I made it exactly as specified. When I saw how runny the batter was I was a bit concerned but it turned out spongy and moist.
I took a reviewer's advice and made the cream cheese chocolate frosting and it was perfect.

Yes, for what it is, this is a 5-Star recipe--but it's not a one-bowl recipe!  I'm surprised that no one knows the purpose of the vinegar.  It's to sour the milk.  You put the vinegar in a glass measuring cup and then fill with milk to to the 1 cup line.  Then wait 15 to 25 minutes until the milk shows signs of souring (curdling).  This is a time-honored method of inexpensively adding flavor and richness to baked goods.  Buttermilk can't match it.  I remember years ago, learning to cook in my mother's kitchen and scoffing at her old-timey farm-raised ideas.  I used buttermilk instead of soured milk in my dad's favorite Coconut Raisin Cookies and had to listen to him tell how I just couldn't match my mom for making good cookies.  I went right back to the sour milk!  The Farm Journal Test Kitchens supported my findings, too.  

The other item I would mention is DON'T FORGET THE VANILLA!  No chocolate cake is ever complete without vanilla.  Yes, the coffee (I use espresso) brings out the rich, deep flavor notes of the chocolate, but the vanilla highlights the "flowery," sweet notes.  To achieve the full depth and range of chocolate flavor, you need the vanilla.  Then, when you smother this complex, delicious cake with a sweet frosting, you will have a truly complete chocolate experience.  I chop this cake into serving-sized cubes and freeze them in squares of plastic wrap.  Perfect treats at a moment's notice!  Thank you for this recipe.

Woohoo! This cake is the best and I never rate anything 5 stars! Even better than Hersheys' recipe.

You can't taste the vinegar at all and a hint of coffee flavor will only show up depending on the frosting.

Because I love chocolate so much I made a few adjustments; dusted the pan with cocoa powder instead of flour and added 1/4 c more cocoa to the recipe. Though I'm sure it would come out just as good as is!

It was a snap to mix up in one bowl, a snap to rinse off the bowl and utensils, and a snap to bake (even though my stove has issues).

I only had a glass pyrex dish and despite that it still came out moist. You know, the kind of moist where if you touch the top some fine crumbs will sticks to your fingertip. Yummy. 

It was very much like Starbauchs black out cake if you have had it. Only without the ganache.

I frosted it with Chocolate Cheese Frosting found here on Allrecipes by Carol. I will definately be using this recipe when I want a quick and fool proof moist cake. I had heard that the best chocolate cake recipes called for vinegar but this was the first that proved it. Thank you Kelly!

I was looking for a devil's food cake recipe similar to the flavor of store bought cake mixes for ages.  This one is it!  It is better than the commercial mixes too as the cake does not fall apart getting it out of the pan.  Also, I was able to cut down the amount of sugar by half without any loss of flavor or texture.

This is THE BEST chocolate cake I have ever tasted! Wow, and so easy. I didn't even have to get the mixer out; did fine by hand. As suggested by others, I replaced milk and vinegar with buttermilk. I used this recipe to make cupcakes, baked at 350 degrees for 24 minutes. Perfection.

I have used this recipe for many cakes and have gotten rave reviews from everyone.  I find it moist enough, chocolatey enough, everything enough.  I haven't and won't change a thing.  If it is worth 5 stars, it doesn't need changing.  If it needs changing, it isn't worth 5 stars!

This cake is a lifesaver! We were stranded by a snowstorm on my daughter's birthday -- I had planned to make an easy box cake...but couldn't get to the store so I searched for a quick chocolate cake..ended up here. LOVED THIS CAKE! I used a whole cup of cocoa (Ghiradelli) and a little extra sugar and I also added a couple of pinches of cardomom. After it cooled I whipped up some heavy cream with vanilla and confectioners sugar and spread it on 1 layer and put 3/4 of a can of cherry pie filling on top (after straining off most of the cherry juice), covered the rest of the cake with the whipped cream, put the remaining cherries in the middle of the cake and then covered the whole thing with finely grated chocolate. THIS was excellent -- my version of Black Forest Cherry Cake. Excellent.

Oh my goodness, so good!  I was a little hesitant to try it because I had never made a cake that called for coffee and vinegar, but it turned out awesome!  I did add a little more cocoa and sugar because I was after a rich cake, and that it was.  It was also very moist.  A definite winner.  Thank you for sharing!

This is flat out the absolute best chocolate cake recipe ever.  I have used for cupcakes, sheet cakes, tall stacked birthday cakes, and a three tier wedding cake.  It is moist, dense and tastes exactly like you hope chocolate cake will.  I've experimented with adding accent flavors by using almond extract, orange rind and cointreau and espresso powder.  All were divine.  Since this cake is so moist, it stays fresh and delicious much longer than you'd expect. I have this cake recipe burned into my memory and would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone.

I've had this recipe forever.  We call it Chocolate Throw Together Cake.  Try topping it with a frosting made of 1 pound powdered sugar, 1 Cup Peanut Butter, and 2-3 tablespoons milk.  Have a cold cup of milk ready to wash it down with.  Excellent.

This is the best chocolate cake I've ever tasted!  I added the vinegar to the milk (didn't measure- maybe more like a tablespoon though) and let it turn into "buttermilk" before using.  I also added a splash of vanilla.  I baked it in a bundt pan and it took 45 minutes.  It was moist, dense and rich.  Perfection!  I topped it with dulce de leche (the boil in the can type) and then topped that with some Heath bits.  This is the ultimate in sweet decadence.  Thanks so much for this recipe, Kellygurll- I'll never use another recipe for chocolate cake again- this is IT!

Whoops! I should have stayed in bed today. Ever have one of those days? I was late for an appointment and then came home to make cupcakes and used Ground Chocolate with Cocoa instead of Unsweetened Cocoa. Simple mistake, always a good idea to pay attention and read labels.   The batter is runny but it was great for pouring cupcakes...although it seems that I've forgotten what 2/3 of a cup is and filled the cups to 3/4. Like I said, there just those days when anything technical or having to do with numbers and simplistic abilities should be avoided.    All that said, the cupcakes are marvelous! What a good recipe, to be able to recover from accidents and perform so well. Maybe it was just too easy? I did mix the wet ingredients in a separate bowl and then added to dry. Did not use a mixer, just a hand whisk.

Very easy and very tasty.  Also works with soy milk.

Try bittersweet cocoa and milk chocolate frosting!

This cake tasted just like a boxed cake mix. Boxed cake mix is good, but if I'm going to all the effort of making a cake from scratch I want it to taste better than the boxed stuff. I don't know why I choose to try this when I have previously used 2 amazing chocolate cake recipes (black magic cake and one bowl chocolate cake III from this site. From now on I'll stick to those). I did appriciate how easy this was to make though.

As suggested I used more Cocca and sugar.  I also used Buttermilk in place of milk and vinegar. Oh boy what a treat this cake was. Even those who are not chocolate cake eaters were very happy.  Thanks for sharing.  I used silicone bakeware and I still prepared the pan. As I understand it this cake can crumble something awful. ***Update** Using vinegar and milk has the same taste as using buttermilk.  Buttermilk crumbles and sticks a little to the pan. Vinegar and milk did not stick at all**

[Really 4.5 rated]  Simple to make and a really nice rich cake. I think the coffee addition really does the trick.   I covered with ganache and raspberries and it was quite the treat! Perfect for the chocoholic in your life!

Perfect in every way!  I paired this with Sturdy Whipped Cream Frosting (by Jo-Lynn from this site),  and it made for a striking presentation with the dark chocolate cake and the white frosting...also perfect because it was just the right amount of sweetness in both the cake and frosting.  I made two 9-inch round cakes with this recipe.

This made excellent cupcakes.  The recipe made 28 cupcakes and I baked them for 20 minutes exactly.  Let sit in the cupcake tins for about 10 minutes and then removed to a baking rack to cool completely.  Frosted with the Peanut Butter Frosting from AR and they were a hit at a work potluck!  Thanks so much for posting this easy, delicious recipe.

This cake is so easy to make and delicious!!!  I used cake flour, dark unsweetened cocoa and buttermilk (no vinegar) as suggested by another reviewer.  The entire cake was gone quickly.  Next time I'll make two!!  Thanks for a great recipe, Kellygurll!!  I used 'Rich Chocolate Frosting' by Amy Via from the  Allrecipes website.  Excellent together!!!

This is so easy and very good! Next time (and there will definitely be a next time!) I'll try buttermilk and will buy higher quality cocoa. I've seen other chocolate recipes that add coffee or espresso powder but have never tried them, I'm glad I did, I'm sure it made the difference! Thanks!

I used skim milk, and this turned out pretty good. Will try adding chocolate chips next time. Used instant coffee, and all milk, no water. Definitely will make again.

The cake is very moist and very chocolaty. Followed the recipe except I used water instead of coffee.  I doubled the recipe and made 42 cupcakes for my grandson's birthday celebration.   I frosted it with cream cheese frosting and the taste was wonderful. Very yummy. Thanks for this great recipe.

Absolutely Perfect! Made for my son's birthday cake today and everyone loved it. I did sub buttermilk for the milk/vinegar and will do the same next time. There were 10 people here and the cake is gone! Not a crumb left. Everyone wanted seconds. I used a bundt cake and it worked out with no problems at all, and was done in my oven in 35 min. No need to look any further for a chocolate cake recipe. This is the one. Thanks for sharing!

This was a great cake. I ended up having to make in in a smaller pan because that was all I had but used the other batter for cupcakes. The only differences i'll make next time will be to add vanilla to the batter and to cook at a lower temperature. Because of the batter being so thin, 325 is much better. I started the cake at the listed temp and ended up lowering it because the middle was still liquid but the edges were getting dark. My cupcakes baked at 325 came out perfect!

This is still my favorite chocolate cake recipe, I agree with the people who say it needs more chocolate (I gotta try adding more cocoa).

Lately I've been using this recipe for the homemade ice cream cake recipe on this site (see the link).  It's perfect!
http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Ice-Cream-Cake-2/Detail.aspx?evt19=1

I let the cake cool, slice it down the middle with a bread knife, put a sheet of waxed paper between the layers, wrap the whole cake in waxed paper and freeze it.  It's easier to work with when the cake is frozen.

Perfect recipe with no modifications. I baked it in a bundt pan and frosted with a chocolate cream cheese icing.  Will make another later this week and try a different frosting so I have an excuse to present another cake to the family.

My husband said this is the best chocolate cake he has ever had. It was ridiculously easy to make and stayed super moist through two days. Great with Rich Chocolate Frosting, also on this site.

Wow, what delicious cake...so moist and flavourful.  I made them into cupcakes instead of a cake (baked for about 15 min @350 degrees) and Iced them with mocha frosting recipe from this site.  Amazing.  This will be my go to chocolate cake recipe...and so easy too!

very similar to the recipe i use making black bottom cupcakes. I'll try it tomorrow in a bundt pan and use a peanut butter frosting by request. When in my experimenting mode I might even try to modify the cream cheese filling for the cupcakes to add PB, reduce CC.....will let you know.

This recipe was very easy for me. I lined pan with cocoa powder instead of flour. Also  when it was done,I topped it with semi sweet chocolate pieces and made a super choclate sauce (hot )and drizzled it over the warm cake.WOW great stuff..Next time I am going to serve this right after dinner warm!

I made this cake for my sous chef at work. She loved it. I subbed buttermilk for the milk/vinegar,  cake flour for A.P. flour and made as directed. My chef ( who is a James Beard Award Winner) loved it. This truly is an awesome cake.

I have made this recipe several times, and I love it!!  I decided to use natural applesauce instead of oil to cut down on fat, and it is still fantastic.  An easy way to get your chocolate fix without the extra fat.  Wonderful recipe.  I make this with my lowfat chocolate frosting.  To die for !!!  THANKS SO MUCH FOR THIS AWESOME RECIPE!!  =)

Believe it or not... I used HALF the sugar, and added dark chocolate chunks.  Incredible and delicious!  I halved the recipe (I baked it to satisfy my chocolate craving), knowing I wouldn't want to share! I drizzled a melted chocolate glaze over the top.

This is such a simple recipe and I really enjoyed making it. I would advise you cut down a lot on the coffee, say to about 1/4 cup, and make your own icing by using icing sugar, butter, 1 tablesp. vannilla essence and no more than 2 tablesp. cocoa. This is a family favourite not to be missed!

Sup Folks,
I would consider myself a novice baker, I have only baked two cakes in my life. Both of them turned out hella bad, but those failures did not deter me since I still have a love for cakes.

Tonight at 8:20 pm I had a sudden urge to bake a cake. The sparse amount of ingredients led me to this recipe. Let me tell you, this recipe is dope. I created possibly one of the most hideous cakes known to mankind...but it tasted incredible! The moist, chocolatey,  coffee undertones made my pile of dirt taste on par with a cake fresh out of Martha Stewarts top picks.  I was going to bring it to my mothers christmas dinner as a desert but its most likely going to be breakfast lol :)  I sit here now 11:14pm and with great satisfaction I now review this recipe with a belly full of cake and a smile on my face. Shout out to whoever made this recipe. To summarize my analysis
Taste 5/5
Ease of bake 5/5
Joy Factor 5/5
Smiles 5/5

The big problem with using cocoa powder is that it lacks the absolute ingredient to have the richest chocolate flavor ever : cocoa butter. It all comes down to the solids AND butter, not the solids only.
As a result, this cake (and I must admit, all cakes using only cocoa powder) is unfortunately very disappointing. 

I put two stars because I feel it might be an acceptable base for some heavy fillings and frosting.

Like other chocolate cake recipes with coffee and vinegar, this one did not disappoint. I love one bowl recipes, and this one didn't even require me to take out a mixer - I just whisked by hand and that was sufficient. Also, I subbed 3 TB mayonnaise for each egg because I was out of eggs. I added 1 tsp vanilla. I also attempted to bake in two 8" round pans, and it baked over the rim (to be expected) as an FYI to others. Thanks for the great recipe!

Perfect chocolate cake! I used to use the Too Much Chocolate Cake recipe from this site....but now i will use this one. It is very moist and rich. I sifted the dry indredients, other than that I stuck to the recipe. Perfect!

If you like your chocolate cake extra moist use the buttermilk instead of the regular milk, and !! brown sugar instead of white.  Easy chocolate icing, add one cup of heavy cream and 7 ounces of chopped bitter chocolate in one container, put in in the microwave on High and stir every 50 seconds until it starts to rise, about 3 or 4 times depending on your microwave. Let cool 15 minutes and voila!

I've found my go-to chocolate cake recipe! I was always puzzled by my family's traditional chocolate cake as I found it didn't taste like chocolate. This cake most definitely does! It was also easy to work with, and didn't suffer from being frozen for a week. It was still chocolatey and moist! Thanks!

A great recipe for a superbly moist and delicious chocolate cake. I used brown sugar instead of white and cut the quantity in half. I didn’t have brewed coffee so just dissolved 3 tsps of instant coffee in cold water, although will only use 2 tsps the next time. I also added 10 ml vanilla extract to bring all the flavours together and baked it at 180 and it was done in 30 mins. I am planning on making it again for my chocoholic boyfriend's birthday and will glaze it with the Pro Ganache found on this site. Thank you for sharing the recipe!

In comparing chocolate cake recipes on this site, I finally decided on this one because of the reviews and the lower calorie fat count.  Now, I did make some changes to try to make this less of a guilty pleasure, and more of just a pleasure. I used half sugar and half Splenda, used 1/4 of a cup of oil and added one snack container of unsweetened applesauce (110g. For personal flavor I increased the cocoa to one cup, added a teaspoon of vanilla and a teaspoon of cinnamon. Finally I did as one other reviewer suggested and used a little balsamic instead of regular white vinegar.  I used 3-8 inch round pans. The cake turned out chocolaty, moist, with a good texture just plain great. If you are looking to cut some fat and calories, these changes will help, and will not affect the taste at all. I hope this gives someone a few more variations on this fabulous recipe.

This cake was exceptional. It looks a bit deceptively simple or non-special, but it will really blow your mind--and impress the heck out of your guests. I made this for my husband's birthday and everyone raved, and am looking forward to making this for my father's birthday next week. 
I used a rich chocolate ganache for the frosting--it was incredible. I also used a full cup of cocoa. 

Thank you for the recipe!

This cake could not be any easier to make.  I substituted all-purpose flour with self-raising flour and omitted both baking powder and baking soda, and it turned out beautifully.  In fact, I just dumped all the ingredients in a mixer and crank it up until I feel like stopping.  I even licked the batter off the spatula and would have finished the whole bowl if not for my husband reminding me that I was supposed to bake it first.  Do check your cake from time to time as little difference to the oven will have major effect on the cake.  Happy trying everyone!

This is the best chocolate cake recipe I have ever tried; super moist and fluffy!  I used the recipe as is, only I made cupcakes with it.  It made about 3 dozen cupcakes! I used a basic cream cheese frosting recipe but added a tsp. of peppermint extract to it.  The chocolate and mint is an awesome combination!  I'll never use another chocolate cake recipe ever again!  This is now my go to recipe!

I have always had a weakness for a good dark chocolate cake. This one takes the cake!!! It came out perfect each time I made it. I used Ghiradelli dark cocoa and it was great. Topped it with a white chocolate ganache. with dark chocolate shaving and I've been getting request for more ever since.
It is by far the easiest and best tasting dark chocolate cake I've ever used. Thanks a  million

This was so easy and one of my favorites on this site.  Be warned the batter is very watery but cooks up great.  The cake is much better the next day and I put some cream cheese frosting on it.  I changed nothing because it is good as it is....

I have used this recipe twice now, once for a rectangular cake, another for a smaller cake. Both really moist and rich. However, as with even the picture on the top of this recipe, it seems to have trouble rising in the middle. Does anyone know why?

It was a good chocolate cake - moist and fluffy - but I didn't find it very exciting flavor-wise.  To me, it didn't have any real depth of flavor, despite the 1 c coffee, and didn't taste like "dark" chocolate at all.  Once I added frosting to it, it was better, but on its own it was pretty blasse.  I will probably make a different chocolate cake recipe next time.  I had high hopes for this recipe, and am bummed it fell short of my expectations.

This cake is very good and has excellent texture but was lacking the deep chocolate flavor I was expecting despite my using a high quality cocoa powder.  I used the coffee butter frosting listed on this website which was a nice compliment to the cake.

Great recipe--super easy! I used this recipe to make rocky road cupcakes. I put three mini-marshmallows on the top of each cupcake...I thought they might bake in and disappear (like they do with Disappearing marshmallow brownies recipe on this site) but to my happy surprise, they showed through. I topped with chocolate buttercream and a mix of mini marshamallows, chopped pecans, and mini chocolate chips. They were SO cute and quite tasty! I think I ended up with about 30 cupcakes, filling them 3/4 full.
**I added instand espresso instead of brewed coffee, since I had that on hand.

Amazing, simply amazing!  I made exactly as is, except that I did use another bowl to whisk my wet ingredients before I added to dry, and I was bad and added some chocolate chunk pieces :)  I made in a 9X13 and topped with my own chocolate cream cheese frosting.  Made this for a 50th birthday party and had many people tell me it was the BEST cake they ever tasted.  Thank you so much for sharing, it was SO GOOD!

I'm a chocolate fan .. and this cake:: STTTIISSFACTION!. absolutely soft and fluffy the first day and .. soft and moist the second, i like it better the next day. As some reviewrs suggested i added about a cup of cocoa and strong coffee i dont have an espresso machine or coffee maker so i used instant coffee dissolved in water and it turned out just fine. top it with chcocolate sour cream glaze and wow! i have to keep myself from making this often or i'll gain like hell. i love devils food cake but i hate making stuff out of boxes, it just doesnt give me the satisfaction that creating something from scratch does. this has ended my search for box alternatives to devils food cake....Thankyou so much for sharing

Wow! Best chocolate cake that I have ever made. I only intended to make two little changes to the recipe. I only keep whole wheat flour in the house so that was a given and I planned to use almond oil but realized too late that I only had 1/4 cup so I also had to use 1/4 cup of butter. The cake took significantly longer to bake than I anticipated but it was worth the wait. A beautful, dark, dense, moist cake that was a wonder to behold once it was frosted (chocolate mocha cream cheese frosting) and piled high with berries. The perfect Valentine's cake!

This cake is so moist and flavorful. I used buttermilk instead of the milk. I used a Cream Cheese frosting and it was wonderful. This recipe is definitely a KEEPER! I also made this as a layer cake and they baked aproximately 30 minutes. Thanks for sharing such a good recipe!

This was the BEST dark chocolate cake I have ever had/made.  I couldn't believe it wasn't from a box.  Often scratch cakes can lack that moistness but not this one...AMAZING!  I am keeping this recipe for life!!!

I had a serious chocolate craving... just to give you an idea of how desperate I was for something chocolatey, it's 1am where I am.  I don't have any butter on hand which renders my other chocolate cake recipe useless, so I did some browsing and came across this one. No butter.  Great reviews.  First off, the batter was an indication that this cake was going to be great.  I actually reserved a bit and prepared a little ramekin I have and made a single serving microwave cake while the big ones baked in the oven.  Wonderfully moist and sweet, very chocolatey.  I did follow others' advice to add more cocoa powder (used a little more than a cup) and some more sugar (used about 1 1/4 cup).  I made 2 cakes (9" round pans) - one for me and one for a neighbor.  I dusted mine with some simple powdered sugar for a clean and simple look.  And after 3 - yes, THREE - pieces, I had to log on to review this before I slipped into a chocolate coma.  Oh, and I don't really have to worry about cleaning up because the one bowl thing is brilliant.  Great recipe - this will be replacing my current chocolate cake recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

LOVED this recipe. However, I did use 3/4 cup SPECIAL DARK hershey's coco and 1/4 cup regular unsweetened coco. added extra 2 tbs sugar. I sifted the dry ingrediants.  My roommate doesn't really like home-made chocolate cakes (loves the box cakes), but she loved this recipe. It was very moist and had a great texture. I frosted it with whipped cream cheese (sturdy whipped cream cheese icing) from this site. It tasted like an oreo cookie! mmmm...

Someone complained about the cake sticking to the pan. You should try a trick that doesn't seem to be popular in English speaking countries (I'm Finnish myself) but works beautifully: don't flour the pan, use dry bread crumbs instead! I've floured a pan only once in my life and will avoid doing it again... Make sure to use bread crumbs you bought because they are usually smoother than the ones you can make.

I really loved this, but was wary because I hate coffee and wasn't sure how good it would be without it.  Well, it was fabulous!  I just used water with vanilla in it instead.  This was the first chocolate cake recipe I've found that makes a moist, light cake. I also followed the tip to use buttermilk.

This is my mom's chocolate cake recipe . . .  a favorite from my childhood and now with my family.  I don't know if these minor differences in the instructions make a difference in the end result, but Mom's recipe has you sift all of the dry ingredients together, then mix all of the wet and then combine this with the dry.  Mom's also uses HOT coffee.  This cake ALWAYS comes out very moist, dense and chocolatey(sp?).  If you like a light fluffy cake this isn't for you.  My chocoholics like it with chocolate butter cream frosting.

This is an excellent recipe.  I like that it is moist and easy to make and doesn't use butter.  Made this for a birthday as a layer cake a couple days ago.  I cut the sugar down to 1 1/4 cups as suggested by a previous reviewer and substituted some egg beaters because I only had one egg.  Instead of using a rectangular pan, I used TWO 9-inch round pans, which I greased and dusted with some of the cocoa powder.  After dividing the batter, it came up halfway in the pan, but rose to a nice height after baking.  I baked it at 350 but was unsure about how long it should bake, so I kept it in there for about 45-50 minutes.  I don't know if it would have been moister if baked for less time but it was still moist.  Used the chocolate cream cheese frosting recipe from this website as recommended but used dark chocolate chips instead of semisweet for more chocolate flavor.  I spread raspberry preserves and some frosting in between the layers.  I was short on time, and frosted the cake when it was not completely cooled but it turned out fine.  We ate it with vanilla ice cream and everyone thought the cake was excellent.  Next time I will add fresh raspberries if they are in season and chopped pecans to the preserve layer because I like some crunch when I eat.  Can anyone recommend a non-chocolate frosting to go with this cake?  I'd like to try a contrast.  Thanks!

This is a very good chocolate cake. The texture is nice and light, unlike some. I found it really didn't need icing....it's delicious without it.[if this shows up with 4 stars, I meant to put 5!]

I have been baking for 60 years and I don't think I've ever known a recipe so easy to make that tastes so good.  If you live in the middle of nowhere, and just want some cake, and you need to use pantry staples commonly found on hand,  this is the recipe to use.  It uses oil so you don't have to soften butter, it uses vinegar so you don't need buttermilk, it uses cocoa so you don't have to melt chocolate.  And if you have all the ingredients assembled, I don't think it  takes more than 5 minutes to make, start to finish.  Great recipe!

Loved it!   I did add a little extra cocoa, as some of the reviews stated.  My family loved it.  I covered it with a generous layer of mocha frosting and then topped that with a dark chocolate ganache.....it was decadent!   A chocoholics dream!  I will definitely make this cake again.

This cake is Super easy in every way and Amazing!  All ingredients are normally in the pantry already, one bowl-easy clean up, and best of all it's rich, moist with an amazing Chocolate flavor!  I've been making it for 4 years now and no one is tired of it lol. Started off because it was my father-in-laws birthday and no one had a car to go get a cake mix-- we had all these ingredients already and it's turned out perfect every time since then.  Before baking, the mix does look watery but that is normal and means you're doing it right.  Tastes great with chocolate/cream cheese icing or german chocolate style.  Love IT!

Chocolate? To die for!!! So moist and fluffy it lasts fresh for a week (well, it could last a week - but it will be eaten by then!) I now use this as my basic cake recipe and have changed it fromn chocolate to pineable to lemon & also orange. It converts easily to any flavors. Add some sest - no problem! Add some nets - no problem! Add some fruit - no problem! Make it into cupcakes - no problem! Bake it in a bunt or jelly roll pan - no problem! I made this for Easter into the shape of a bunny rabbit and decorated it with jelly beans & candies & coconut. Beautiful! (Sorry no pix)  This is a totaly versatile recipe - not just for cholate lovers alone! It travels marvelously! I'll never use a box again!

Delicious, moist and very chocolaty!  I used extra brute cocoa powder, buttermilk and 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar.  Got 27  cupcakes I filled 3/4 full to bake.  Will make again.

SUPER moist cake.  I let it sit overnight before frosting or I think it would have ripped.  But so delicious and EASY, it was worth it.  Made it with two round cake pans and cooked for 25 min. Yum!

This is one delicious cake!  It's moist, rich and flavorful.  The only change I made was to add some vanilla.  For Valentine's Day, I made half the recipe in an 8 X 8 glass pan because I didn't want too much cake around to destroy my diet.  It wasn't a high cake  - it only rose to about halfway up.  But man, topped with chocolate buttercream frosting, was it to-die-for!

Clearly I'm the odd one out here but I really didn't care for this cake - it only gets three stars because folks at the part I took it to sought me out to compliment me on the cake/icing (though I am convinced they were just being nice!) My cake sunk in the middle, even after I baked it til the toothpick came out clean and never once moved the oven tray until it was time for it to come out. The cake itself was extremely dense. I used the chocolate cream cheese recipe from this site, as recommended by some, and found that it simply compounded the richness and thickness of the cake. Maybe I'm just not the chocoholic I thought I was!! I will try another recipe before I try this one again (though I'm fully prepared to admit I did something wrong here), as I prefer a still moist but overall spongier, lighter cake. If I made this again I'd suggest a lighter, more whipped or mousse-like icing, perhaps raspberry-flavored, maybe peanut butter. And a tall glass of milk!

this is my staple chocolate cake! i've made it so many times, the recipe is awesome. i always make my own buttermilk by putting 1T. of lemon juice and adding milk up to the 1c. line and sit for 5 min. i pair this with rich chocolate frosting by amy v from this site it is an amazing combination you won't be disappointed!

To give this a kick, I leave out the coffee n instead add 1 c water w/ 2 tspns raspberry or strawberry flavoring. It turns out tasting like a gourmet chocolate raspberry bar. Ive learned the hard way that I should mix the dry ingredients, set aside then add them to wet ingredients. Also like others I use buttermilk instead of milk n vinegar. Lastly the best temp for my 9x13 is 365F for 37min. Next time I'm gonna try almond flavoring w/ almonds on top n try for 35 min.

OMG!  So good!  I made this two times in two weeks.  And each time it was gone in two days!  No icing needed for this cake!  My only complaint is that I couldn't get it out of the pan in one piece--and I greased and floured the second time.  I think that may be more of an issue with the cook rather than the recipe.... *sigh*

This cake was very moist and delicious!  I had 3 types of vinegar in my cupboard, none of them plain white vinegar, so I used apple cider vinegar and it turned out fine.  I thought the cake was very moist as written, even without using buttermilk as others suggested.  We will definitely make this again, especially since it is SO easy and doesn't mess up the whole kitchen.  We want to try it next time with chocolate cream cheese frosting.  We made it for a birthday party and everyone loved it!  I especially loved the richness I thought the coffee added.  Will never go back to a box cake again!

This chocolate cake is very good and very easy to make.  In my opinion that deserves 5 stars.  I made it for my son's birthday. I, however, am not a cake or chocolate lover, so I can only by other's comments.  The kids and adults loved this cake.  My son gave the cake 5 stars.  From what I tasted this was a nicely flavored, moist, standard chcocolate cake.  I followed the recipe exactly, used an 9 & 13 pan (greased & floured). It cooked in 37 minutes.  I let it cool in the pan overnight, covered with a dish towel. In the morning I flipped it onto a cutting board. I gently wiggled and it came out nicely on its own with no breakage. The best part for me was the one bowl mix.  The batter is very thin when you pour it in the pan. Don't let that scare you.  This cake recipe really works!  It's my go to cake from now on, since I live with two chocolate cake lovers.

Amazing cake!!!! VERY moist. It was perfect. Since I prefer dark chocolate & I often find cakes far too sweet for my taste I reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup and increased the cocoa by 1/4 cup. Absolutely wonderful!!! Thanks!

This cake was way too dense with not a lot of flavor. My sons and grandsons, who love anything I bake, didn't care for this.  Couldn't get them to finish a piece. Just too heavy and not very moist.  And I did follow the suggestions from other raters.

Three stars because everyone seemed to like it... but it tasted like a box cake... and I like box cakes but if I wanted a cake that tasted like one... I would have made it from a box.  Not from scratch.

I would have loved to give this recipe 5 stars, but given that I had to alter it even after following the alterations given by others, I just can't. I have made this cake twice. The first time for a dinner get-together with my fiancee's extended family. My fiancee, whom I would consider an accomplished cook, said that it was dry. I tried it and felt that it was missing - something although I could not quite put my finger on it.  Needless to say, I wanted to make it again to make sure my oven wasn't off kilter and to see if the recipe is really worth the ingredients. Well, it is - with a few more alterations, in my opinion. I did the appropriate substitutions for the flour, and milk and vinegar for buttermilk. I also added an additional 1/4 cup of buttermilk and 2 tsp. of vanilla. The batter was thin like its supposed to be and a cooked it at 350 for exactly 40 minutes. It came out perfectly. Moist, chocolaty and scrumptious. This cake recipe is a keeper with these changes. Also, thanks to my mom, an expert cook who recommended adding the vanilla. It improves the flavor by leaps and bounds. This cake is REALLY delicious with a few changes.  PS. I get the feeling that cake flour vs. regular flour would make little to no difference if the directions and other substitutions were followed carefully. Thanks for the recipe!

This IS a good cake as the reviewers indicate.  A couple of notes:  1) be aware this is a coarse textured cake and 2) a frosting like those used on Texas Sheet cakes does not work well between layers as it is absorbed into the cake - this makes a rather gooey cake.

This cake is not only amazingly delicious but so easy to make!  I baked it in a bundt pan for 35 minutes and it was moist for over a week in the fridge.  Drizzle iced it with Chocolate Ganache icing from this site w/1 tbsp Grand Marnier and 1 tbsp Amaretto liquors and everyone raved!  Thanks for the delicious cake recipe.  My  new favorite!!!

Followed the recipe exactly.  This was not moist.  I didn't get the choco-holic flavor that I'd hoped for, either.  I have another chocolate cake recipe that I always use, but it is too moist to make it as a layer cake.  I thought this would be the layer cake I was looking for.  Guess I'll have to keep looking.

Very easy, very yummy.  I might add a little more chocolate next time, either more cocoa or chocolate chips or both, but I'm a chocoholic.  :-)  Really good with Chocolate Cheese Frosting from this site.

I really want to rate this 5 stars and I would if I had just made it for my family, but I used this recipe in my first wedding cake. I tested it once and it baked fine, but I had some problems with it falling when I made it for the wedding. Every time I would stick a toothpick in, it would deflate around that area. And this cake being so chocolately and gooey, it is hard to tell when it is done. Other than that though, this is a phenomenal tasting chocolate cake!!! Yum! Very moist! I filled it with a mocha chocolate filling I got off the Wilton website in the wedding section and it was sooooooooo delicious! Everyone loved it!!!!!

Very good, very easy. I subbed buttermilk for half the milk and omitted the vinegar. Added a healthy shake of cinnamon (prob several tsps). Delicious and moist--my coworkers are gobbling them up!

this stuff is fantastic!  I made this into cupcakes to bring to a party and got about 1/2 of them in the liners before I realized  that I had forgotten to add the sugar (OOPS!).  I scraped the batter out of the liners back into the bowl, added the sugar, put the batter BACK into the liners and put them in the oven, convinced that they weren't going to turn out.  They were still FABULOUS!

Sorry - I am usually able to give an excellent rating to the recipes I find here but not this time. Even though I greased my pans with Crisco and floured with cocoa powder this cake stuck to the pans like crazy! Both layers broke. I tasted a bit of it...nothing to write home about. This is for guests so into the trash it goes. I'll try another recipe.

This is a great dark, moist cake.  I took other advice and used buttermilk instead of regular milk and vinegar.   The batter is a little thin and I was concerned, but it bakes up wonderful.  I also increased the servings to 18 so as to have nice, thick layers.  Tastes incredible with cream cheese icing and strawberries!

This recipe is a good place to start, but it's not chocolatey enough for me even though I added the extra cocoa (1 full cup) and 2 extra tablespoons sugar as mentioned by someone else. I LOVE how the coffee brings out the chocolate flavor that is there though. I also noticed that it was a little bit dry, but I may have just baked it too long (new oven, still practicing).
I will make it again with a bit more cocoa, sugar, veg oil, and a shorter cooking time.

This cake is excellent and very easy.  I have made it once and a cake and once as cupcakes (just reduce the cook time to 22 - 25 minutes).  I used dark cocoa powder for the cupcake version and they were perfect - moist and flavorful.  I used cake flour and buttermilk in the case version (leaving out the vinegar as suggested in the posts) and in the cupcake version used all-purpose flour, whole, milk and vinegar - both versions were great.  I also added a dash of cinnamon and a dash of cayenne pepper which was subtle but made for a very good combination of flavors.  This will be my standard chocolate cake (and cupcake) recipe for now on.  Thanks!!

This was so moist!  I made it as cupcakes - 350 for 17 mintues.  It made 30 cupcakes - filling the cup 2/3 full.  I followed the advice and upped the cocoa to a full cup, added 2tbls more of sugar, substituted buttermilk for milk and deleted the vinegar - excellent results.  Then, I filled the cupcakes with a whoopie pie filling (1 stick of butter, 1 cup of confectioners sugar, 1 tsp of vanilla and 2 heaping spoonfuls of Marshmallow Fluff)and covered them in dark chocolate ganache -recreating a Hostess Cupcake for a more gourmet palate.  Fantastic!

Wonderful! Everyone raved about it at the office (and one co-worker even admitted to sneaking a piece to take home for his wife). I followed the suggestions of the previous reviewer and used buttermilk in place of milk, omitted the vinegar,   and used cake flour. I used Green & Black's cocoa (1 cup in place of 0.75), and I decided to add an extra 2 Tbsp sugar as well. I topped with cream cheese frosting (NOT chocolate, just regular, white cream cheese frosting). It was a big hit.

Cocoa powder made by different manufacturers come in different degrees of bitterness, and coupled with how strong you make your coffee would determine the amount of sugar you need to make this cake to your ideal taste, so I would suggest that you use 1 1/4 cup of sugar when making batter, and add to taste. I used 1 3/4 cup in mine. The hot or cold coffee was confusing for me, so I just used lukewarm. Perfect chocolate cake. Thank you very much for sharing.

i just made this for my englsih teacher and lucky i was planning to cut the top off because i just ate half of it! This cake is delicious and resembles a moist and rish chocolaty mud cake. Other reviewers have said that it is not chocolaty enough, but it certainly is- perhaps the quality of the cocoa was lacking. Anyway I will be making this recipe over and over again for years to come because it is so professional and amazing tasting but it is so easy to make with ingredients that you always have! Also my cake took about 60 minutes to cook.

To the previous reviewers: Are you not greasing your pans?? My cakes FLEW out of their pans!  While making this recipe, I must admit I made a terrible mistake.  After putting the batter into the pans, then placing them into the oven for 5 minutes, I realized I forgot to add veg. oil! DOH! I must have been distracted by my boyfriend while mixing! So I rushed back to the kitchen and tried to mix the oil into the already 5-minute baked batter.  Turned out GREAT even with that mistake!  I can be VERY judgemental when it comes to how people bake, and I think half of the bad reviews on all recipes are from people who don't know what they are doing!  So I think this cake deserves more credit for how simple it is.  It might not be "the best cake ever" but it's great if you don't have all the ingredients to make a complicated delicious cake!

Holy cow. This is the best chocolate cake I have ever had.  My friend made it and thank goodness he didn't tell me that it had coffee in it, because I hate coffee and you couldn't taste it at all.  This cake was as moist as it gets.  Everyone flipped out over it.  I don't really like sweets and I went for a second huge piece. Excellent with the "Chocolate Cheese Frosting". Thanks Kelly!!

amazing texture, was easy to cut into pieces, not like hersheys perfectly chocolate cake, which, although is still my current favourite, falls apart easily.  The one problem I had was that the middle of the cake sunk after it came out of the oven.
Overall, an amazing cake  (you can't taste the coffee)

I volunteered to make my brother and sister-in-law's wedding cake.  I made over five recipes for a 'cake tasting' for her.  This recipe was by far the favourite!  And by far the easiest!!  It is moist, doesn't crumble much which makes layering super easy, and it has a depth of flavour that makes it delicious!!  That was over 10 years ago and they STILL talk about their wedding cake!!  It's been the only chocolate cake we make in our family since!

I made this cake for a girlfrinds birthday who loves chocolate anf cake and she loved it.  I did use applesauce instead of oil, dusted the pan with cocoa instead of flour - and those are the only changes I made to the recipe.  I would certainly make this one again.  And it was super easy to make too!

This recipe had me worried because the batter was really thin. I double checked the ingredients after I finished thinking I might have missed something.  I didn't!  This cake is delishious, easy to make. I made cupcakes and used a vanilla cream cheese frosting. The balance of the heavy icing and the light and chocolate cake was decadent  and enjoyed by all!

So easy! Made it with the hard chocolate frosting and topped when cooled with a dollop of whipped cream. Yum.

Wonderful cake ...super moist.. This cake was soo amazing that my kids devoured the entire cake in 36 hours!!!!!!!! The only thing I did different was added 1 cup buttermilk to replace the milk and vinegar and topped it with semi sweet chocolate chips just before putting it in the oven

While I modified it slightly, I imagine the original is worthy of 5 stars as well. I switched 1/2 c plain whole milk yogurt and 1/2 c half and half for the 1 c milk.  Baked the cake in a bundt pan for 40 minutes at 350F.  Also, I prepared my pan with cocoa and it came out perfectly.  Lots of compliments today!

I tried this as cupcakes and also as a cake. Both ways leaves an indented form. No, I did not move it as one reviewer suggested when others stated the same thing. The taste is great and I made it as written. If you want to fill in the hole with frosting, all is right with the world.

Great things can come with easy recipes. 5 stars for the big bang of chocolate! Use a good powdered cocoa. I doubled this recipe in case because I had a feeling it would be good. Baked it in 2 small 9' round cake pans. Very moist and the height was amazing.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was extremely good. Couldn't be any easier. I used a chocolate cream cheese frosting which I thought went perfect with it. I do not think (like other readers do) you need buttermilk - just follow the recipe as it is.

This is a really good, very simple to make cake. One bowl, three minutes with the KitchenAid, what could be better? I will not hesitate to use this recipe again. Great reviews from everyone who ate it!
However, I made cupcakes. I know my oven is spot on, so it just may have been this batch. But the cupcakes didn't "dome". They did rise, but remained flat on top. I was frosting them so it didn't really matter. The cake was chocolatey, moist, nice crumb and tasty. And hey, one bowl, my goodness.....simple goodness. Try this one for yourself.

A really delicious cake, though next time I would maybe add a few tablespoons more of cocoa, but that is personal preference. Its has just the right amount of sugar where if you add icing its isn't too much. In summary it is very moist cake and has a rich chocolate flavour, and I would recommend trying it out!

I have been married for 20 years and this is the best cake I have ever made. My kids raved that it tastes just like Hostess. I had a carton of sour milk that i didn't want to throw away, so substituted 2 cups of that for the coffee, milk and vinegar. Frosted it with old-fashioned frosting recipe (flour-based) because I didn't have any powdered sugar. Seriously, the best cake I have ever had in my life.

This chocolate cake is amazing! 
I entered this cake in the fair and it won an award.
It's extremely moist!!! I've paired this cake with creamy chocolate frosting.... And also paired it with German chocolate frosting and ganache.... my friend makes this cake with fresh whipped cream and cherries making for a perfect black forest cake!! 
It's fabulous!!!

I made this for my husband's birthday and it was fabulous! Very quick, very easy, and one of the tastiest cakes I have ever made. Paired it with a vanilla buttercream icing from the Food Network, and it was delicious. Our son said it would also be good with just powdered sugar sprinkled on it.

This recipe is excellent! I made it in 2 round cake pans to make a double layer birthday cake for my mother in law and she has been raving about it! I added a can of cherry pie filing (tho I rinsed some of the syrup away so it wouldn't take away from the flavor of the cake itself) for a twist. Yummy!  This is officially me new favorite recipe! Easy enough that my 4 year old enjoyed helping make it, super moist, full of flavor. If I could give more than 5 stars I would!

My cake rose very high, I followed exact recipe. However after 40 min the cake was still very wet in the middle I had to bake for an additional 20 min. Cake turned out too dry.

This is my new favorite chocolate cake recipe.  It is very chocolatey and not too sweet.  I made the this exactly as the recipe said, something I almost never do!  I filled with whipped ganache and covered in liquid ganace.

I baked three cakes today using this recipe.  My only variation was to add a tablespoon of instant espresso to boost the dark chocolate flavor.  It made a nice sturdy cake to split and fill.  I baked two in 9 by 13 inch pans to make a black forest cake to take to church and the third I have baked in 9 inch round layers to frost for my son's birthday.  I used my stand mixer, mixed the dry ingredients first and then added the wet all at once.  A great cake with big flavor that you can work with. I wil make it again and again.

It's delicious.  And quick to put together.  I can not think of any improvement. Make this recipe as written, you will not be disappointed. I needed a small amount, decided to only make a single layer, so I cut this in half.  I spread a thin vanilla frosting on the cake while it was still warm. It was eaten before the next morning.  Thanks for submitting.

WOW! I made this for my best friend's baby shower, as she is a choco-holic and this got great reviews. I'm not a fan of cake, but I CRAVE this one! I made the recommended substitution with buttermilk instead of milk/vinegar, and topped it with a chocolate ganache. It is ridiculously dangerous because it is so amazing and simple to make!

This is an easy and wonderfully moist chocolate cake recipe.  I made it for a family dinner and everyone asked for seconds and doggy bags!  I iced it with a cooked chocolate glaze, which was the perfect topping.

Best chocolate cake ever!! I used cake flour and added an extra 2 tbsp of it. Also omitted vinegar and used buttermilk instead of regular milk.

After all the reviews I was expecting mega chocolate flavor but I didn't get it with this cake.  It definitely is easy to put together and with ingredients I always have on hand.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe other than using buttermilk in place of the milk/vinegar mixture.  It tastes pretty good and the texture is fluffy like a boxed cake.  I found it tasted better and the texture improved after sitting for a day.  Maybe adding more cocoa would up the chocolate flavor for me.

I'm not kidding guys, this is so delicious.  I like to make cupcakes from this but you can do a regular pan, layer, bundt, whatever suits your fancy.  :D  My kids loved this and it's SUPER easy.  This is like Devil's food cake and is really soft.  YUMMM...!  Oh, by the way this makes 24 cupcakes.  Another yummy idea is to add chocolate chips into this or sprinkle on top.

Excellent cake!  I loved that it was super quick to throw together all in one bowl - great for clean up!  I made this recipe exactly as directed and it was a hit!  Very chocolaty, nice and moist, YUM!  Unfortunately, I had no time to make my own frosting or ganache, which certainly would have taken this awesome cake to a whole new level!

Fantastic!  I happened to have buttermilk so I replaces for the milk and vinegar.  What an amazing flavor and the texture is so moist and yet still holds it's shape.  Wonderful!

wow. seriously a keeper. I wanted to imitate "Matilda's" chocolately cake, the one the little white chubby kid eats in the movie. So i used chocolate ganache... OH MY! it was just almost the same, and everyone compared it looks wise. taste..... I'm speechless, and it is the far most moist cake I've tastes.

This cake is fantastic. I didn't change a thing with it and it came out perfect. I made two 8" rounds and I should have done 9" because it rose over the edge, but I was willing to deal with that mess once I tasted it. My family has made me promise to keep this recipe!

Ohhhhhh my!  This was a dense, rich, moist, DARK and wonderful cake.  I made it as a 9 x 13 because I thought it would be too moist to unmold easily, and topped it with a thin but potent espresso icing.  This will be making the rounds at many future birthdays, I can tell you!

wonderful!!!  dense, smooth and sooo moist!  i substituted buttermilk for milk (others have commented that it's more moist this way),  and used 2-7x7 pans instead.  i baked it for approx. 28 minutes.  I stacked the 2 cakes together with coffee butter cream filling in between, then drizzled the hard chocolate glaze and topped with fresh straberries - all from this site.  so good!

So so so easy! Awesome one-bowl chocolate cake. And so chocolatey. The coffee really brings out the taste of chocolate. I didn't have distilled white vinegar so I used white wine vinegar and it worked out fine. Will definitely make it again.

AWESOME CAKE!!  This is truly the BEST chocolate cake recipe EVER.  Seriously.  I followed one reviewer's advice and substituted the 1 cup of milk with 1 cup of whole fat buttermilk - WOW.  Amazing how it turned out.  I baked it in a bundt pan for about 30 minutes.  I had no problems with the cake falling or any dryness at all.  This was extremely rich & moist and very easy to make.  Thank you SO MUCH for sharing this incredible recipe!

I can't believe how MOIST this is! Exactly what I was looking for. I did change it for healthiness. Whole wheat flour, Sugar=1/2 honey, and oil=applesauce.   Upped the cocoa a little and not quite sweet enough, so I'll up the honey next time.

This was fabulous! I substituted cake flour and buttermilk as suggested by other viewers. The cake was moist and tasty. The only problem I had was that i didnt mix the ingredients long enough in my mixer. I got a few clumps of white flour in the finished cake (but that was my fault... i'll know better for next time). I made a layer cake and put a raspberry filling between layers. It was delicious.

This has been my default recipe for a long time now. It's the best chocolate cake I've ever tasted, and everyone begs me to bake it. I throw in some sour cream if I'm baking a day or two ahead of time, but the recipe is perfect as is. Yum!

It was an AVERAGE chocolate cake. It tasted like a simple chocolate cake and i did not taste the coffe at all.  If I could give this cake 2.45 stars I would.  It wasn't gross nor dry just average.

This was so moist that if it hadn't been for a birthday, I would have just dusted it with confectioner's sugar and called it good - it was that tasty. Super dark and tasty. I added ½ a bag of chocolate chips (that I shook in some flour first, so they wouldn't sink) and the cake was flawless. Was super tasty and pretty with a bright white seven-minute frosting.

Great recipe. I made it in two 9in cakes to frost for a Father's Day/Birthday celebration. I was unsure of how chocolaty it was going to be so opted for a vanilla frosting. It was a great combo - crumb of cake was good too. Although I didn't find this to be the most chocolaty cake I've ever had. Could be the type of cocoa powder I used.

I followed the recipe exactly as written. I used fine dutch cocoa (Droste)& made them into cupcakes, pouring them into cupcake paper liners & baking for 25 minutes. Absolutely delicious, moist & chocolatey - much better results than cake mix. We ate them with a scoop of French Vanilla premium ice cream - heavenly! Thank you so much Kellygurll!

This was the first time I had ever baked a cake.  This fact was painfully obvious by the look of it.  The middle had completely sunk in.  However, the pathetic look of my cake did NOT affect the taste of it.  It was sooo good.  My husband & I love dense cakes and this one was perfect.  It was heavy and dense, but extremely moist and flavorful.  I will be making this cake again with one only change...  a bundt cake instead!  ;)

This was a very easy recipe that yielded a delicious, moist cake. I substituted 1 cup of buttermilk for the milk and the vinegar. Topped with the Chocolate Ganache recipe from this site and it made a dessert that was very rich and decadent.

Oh my goodness...! What a cake! And it is so easy, even my husband could do it.  Thank you SO much for this recipe. I will never bake another chocolate cake - not even from a box :-)

WOW WOW WOW!! This cake is fantastic. I also added 1 tsp vanilla to my mix. I will never make any other chocolate cake besides this one. If anybody gives this a bad review or says it was dry, didn't turn out right etc...they really need to stop baking!!! This was the easiest cake I have ever made. I'm passing this recipe on to everyone I know. After 4 days it was still moist and just as good as the first day!!! Love it!

This is one awesome dark chocolate cake!...For a more richer taste add 1 tablespoon balsamic vineager instead of regular vineager....and this recipe is even more better with a dark chocolate topping...melt one 8 ounce dark chocolate bar in 1/4 cup heavycream in a double boiler until melted then add 1 tablespoon balsamic vineagar mix well and pour over cooled cake....the balsamic really brings out the dark chocolate!!....got the idea from Giada Delaurentiis's dark chocolate truffle receipe.

This cake is fantastic and so easy to make!  I followed what some other reviewers did, and substituted the vinegar and milk for 1 cup buttermilk.  I made the recipe into 24 cupcakes, and baked them for 19 minutes at the same temperature and they came out just perfect!  Extremely moist and tasty, and I frosted them with a Creamy Chocolate Frosting recipe from this site. They were great, and even better the next day!  Clean-up was quite easy.  As my father said, the best cupcakes I have made yet.

So. Freakin. Good. 

I took the advice from the other reviewers and made this with cake flour (2 cups + 2 tbsp), a full cup of cocoa, 2 extra tbsp of sugar, buttermilk instead of milk+vinegar, and added a tsp of vanilla. I baked it at 325 and it came out perfect- soooo chocolatey and moist. 

It is VERY sticky- I used a good non-stick bundt pan and also sprayed the bejesus out of it with Pam. After taking it out of the oven, I let it cool in the pan for 10-15 minutes, loosened the edges with a butterknife, and then turned it upside down over a rack and gave it a couple of good shakes and it popped right out, intact. Next time I'll grease the cooling rack too, because the cake even stuck to that a bit. 

I made ganache (also from this site) and drizzled that over the cake. I love it- this recipe is definitely a keeper, and really easy to make.

OMG! This is the easiest, best chocolate cake you will ever make! One bowl! I followed the recipe exactly, except for:
increase the cocoa to 1 cup, added 2 T sugar and modified the AP flour to 1 3/4 cup + 1/4 corn starch. Cooked mine in a bundt pan and used the Satiny Chocolate Glaze for a coworkers BD! Fabulous if I say so myself!

This chocolate cake was great!  The only change I did was use 1 cup of buttermilk, rather than regular milk.  It turned out great.  I just put a simple chocolate icing on it and everyone loved it.  I will definitely make this again!

I read all the reviews on this cake.  I have to admit, it is a very tasty cake, it has very good texture. My problem was that the cake fell in the middle. So I made it again and it did the same thing. Anyone got any suggestions? I did read that maybe the vinegar might have done it.  I really don't know at this point.  The taste is amazing and if I could make it and it did not fall in the middle, I would have to give it a much higher rating. I know that my grand-daughter will still like it although it looks sad, sad, sad, sad.

This is yummy.  I would give it 4.5 stars if I could.  I'm not sure it's the ultimate chocolate cake, but pretty close.  The coffee in the batter makes it very dark.

MMM good! So moist and flavorful. I made it even better by using condensed milk in place of some of the milk in this recipe, and like another reviewer suggested, added extra cocoa and sugar. I also beat the eggs before adding them. Only problem is that both layers sunk in the middle. This may be because the baking powder had expired a month before, though, so I'm not sure it was the recipe's fault! This is a real keeper recipe. I made it for my daughter's seventh birthday and topped it with a marshmallow frosting at her request. I'd love to try it with German chocolate frosting as another reviewer suggested. This was a really easy recipe too!

This cake turned out really well for my friend's birthday party.  I wanted to try this recipe because it seemed quite simple, and also didn't have the high butter/fat content as the other recipes I came across.  I baked it in a loaf pan, and it took almost an hour in the oven.  Also, the name of this recipe is somewhat deceptive.  It is a good chocolate cake, but it isn't exactly "dark".  For those who want a more chocolaty cake this isn't for you.  As another reviewer suggested, I frosted it with German Chocolate Cake icing II.  I topped the whole cake with at least a pint of fresh strawberries.  Very good combination.  I will definitely be using this cake recipe again, because it is almost as easy as opening a box.

Very good. Perfect texture. I baked in 2 9-in round pans, reduced time, and thought I overbaked because the sides got so dark, but it was still moist. Wax paper, greased and cut to fit the bottom of the pans, assured they slipped out perfectly. I also increased my DUTCH PROCESS cocoa to 1 cup. I will try again, adding vanilla and using buttermilk for the milk and vinegar.

I've made this recipe twice now, not altering anything in the recipe.  Rave reviews both times!  (Husband's birthday and Employee's birthday).  Topped it with Choc. Cream Cheese frosting from this site and sliced strawberries on top.  Thanks for sharing a very "expensive tasting" recipe!  Tastes like it's from a high-end bakery!

This cake is so moist that I can't ever get it out of the pan.  That's the only real drawback.  I love this recipe.  I make the coffee fresh and put two squares of unsweetened chocolate right away, so that they melt.  I also throw in another dash of cocoa powder because I find that there is no such thing as too much.  I also combine all of the wet ingredients together so that it is actually a two-bowl methods.  Having tried greasing, greasing and flouring, and even more greasing and flouring, I say just anticipate that this cake is going to stick to the pans (I use 2-3 9" pans).  Very good.

This is an excellent recipe. My cake turned out perfectly and although I love cooking I always seem to have trouble with cakes as they all seem to turn out somewhat "heavy". No this one. My best cake ever. Will DEFINATELY do this one again. Many thanks

This recipe made a excellent birthday cake. Very rich and moist. I used one cup of cocoa for a more chocolatety taste. The coffee is an important ingredient. It brings out the flavor of the chocolate without giving it a coffee taste. I made two 9" layers and spread a whipped chocolate ganache between them, then frosted the layers with Rich Chocolate Frosting from this site. Another must-have for chocolate lovers.

I baked this for my friend's birthday and it was gone within 5 minutes. Everyone had chocolate all over their mouths. It was just pure heaven, cake was moist with a deep chocolaty flavor. Mmmmmm..so nice. I'd recommend first-timers to try this recipe, it's so easy, you just won't go wrong :)

Wow!  this turns out *so* moist!  If you want a really chocolaty taste, you will probably want to increase the cocoa content.  I found this takes way longer to cook - more like 1 hour.

Very moist and delicious! I increased this recipe 4 times and baked the cake in a 12x18 cake pan and baked at 325 degrees for 45-50 minutes.    This cake was for a four year-old party and pretty nuch every piece was consumed by both parents and children. One parent told me that her son never eats the cake part-only the icing so this was definitely impressive to her. I highly recommend this recipe!

WONDERFUL cake! I followed the recipe to a "T", except I substituted soy milk. It made a great, moist, double-layered round cake that was rich. Needless to say it didn't last long!

I was a bit disapointed by this recipe. It was not chocolatey enough, a bit dry as well. I made it into 24 mini cupcakes, and the rest of the batter, I poured it into a 8X8 in pan to make a cake. It was not bad, just was lacking some taste. It was better when I added chocolate silk glaze on top (from this site), but still, other chocolate cake recipes from this site, were wayyy better. Sorry :(

This cake is so moist - I made it for a sheet cake in a 12x18 pan so I doubled the recipe and used a heating core in the center of the sheet cake pan, it was done in the same time (40 mins)- and it came out beautiful - I will make it again and again -It tastes great - Thank you very much--

When I first tried a piece it tasted like a corn bread sord of. After a few hours of cooling, it was very good. I did use instant coffee though, and less than half a cup.

I also used a whip cream/pudding frosting that I found on this site. Not bad. I think next time Ill make a  chocolate frosting and add jar cherries to the cake batter.

I made these into cupcakes, but I overcooked mine a little, so they had a slight burned taste to them :(
They were very moist and very good.
Next time i wont cook them so long :)

I made a double layer german chocolate cake with this recipe.  The cakes broke apart when I tried to take it out of the pans, and they were too soft to put the icing on. I was able to stack them on top of each other and make it work. Overall the cake didn't look great, but tasted pretty good.

I have a couple of from scratch chocolate cake recipes I use frequently but wanted to try something different.  My changes were minimal - substituted cake flour and buttermilk, increased the sugar by 1/4 cup and added 1 tsp. vanilla.  The result was pretty good although the texture was not as good as my other cake recipes.  Also, it should definitely be made into a layer cake.  I baked in a 9 x 13 pan as directed and you get a very high cake which you then frost just on top.  It definitely needs a layer of frosting through the middle.  Would be better baked in 2 round cake pans.

I'm a first time baker. I broused through all your recipe bank and zeroed down on this one. It turned out excellent. I'd recommend to all first time bakers. It was so moist and tasty that my 14 year old daughter forgot all about keeping her figure slim and gobbled almost 3/4 of it. I took the suggestion of one of your members to increase the cocoa by 1/4 cup extra. I topped it with 1 minute icing it tured out delicious. Thank you. - Kuhu.

I would actually say 4-1/2 stars... it wasn't the "absolute best," but it was VERY good.  I tried with cinnamon coffee frosting and it was a bit too much.  I am going to try next time with the chocolate cream cheese... or maybe just a plain cream cheese frosting.  Don't forget to leave extra time to brew that coffee!  (Or use instant as I often do...)

I have always been a loyal Betty Crocker boxed cake mix user.  This is the first made from scratch cake I have ever tried and it turned out great!  Moist and fudgy!  I used International Coffee's Suisse Mocha for the cup of brewed coffee.

Though it needed alterations the final product came out very well. I ommited the coffee as any hint of the taste of coffee my hubby find unpleasant except when he's drinking actual coffee. I instead whipped up a cocoa drink by mixing 2 cups soy milk w/ about 2 tablespoons cocoa powder. In additon to that cocoa powder I still needed about a cup more just to make the batter chocolately as 3/4 cup barely added any cocoa flavor let alone anything deserving of being titled Dark Chocolate! I never use salt in baking so that was also ommited and always use energy egg replaces instead of actual eggs. Made cup cakes w/ the batter and this batter makes a lot! If I had another cup cake pan this batter would had made about 9 or 10 large cup cakes. Final product was chocolately and moist. Whipped up a quickie chocolate frosting w/ sour cream, cream cheese, cocoa powder, powdered sugar, and vanilla ex.

Great moist cake! I too reduced the sugar and upped the cocoa. Served as a layer cake with chocolate ganache as filling and 1st layer of topping, with the Creamy Chocolate Frosting that Tracey Larsen posted on this site. Intense and delicious!

This makes a good chocolate cake, much better and easier than the Hershey's recipe. I took the advice of the other reviewers and reduced the sugar to 1 1/4 cups. The batter tasted a bit too much like coffee so I upped the cocoa powder to another 1/4 cup making 1 cup total of cocoa powder. It's just a good, rich, moist chocolate cake that is very simple to make.

Absolutely delicious cake, so moist, and very easy to make. Unfortunately, after my husband tasted this, I had to promise I would never make a boxed chocolate cake again, but this cake is definetly worth the small amount of effort you need to put forth.

This cake KICKS BUTT!!!!  Oh my gosh was it MOIST!!!  Soooo good!  And I even messed it up:  I went so far as to pour the batter in the pan and put it in the oven before realizing that I'd left out the coffee.  It was only in for less than a minute, so I pulled it out, put it back in the mixer and added the coffee (which was cooling in the fridge, hence my forgetting it). I washed the pan, re-greased and floured it, poured the bater back in.  I can't believe that in spite of that, it still turned out great!  I HIGHLY recommend this recipe!!!

SUPERB!!!  I loved this cake, one of the best I have ever made.  I had to change it a little because I am on a dairy, soy and egg free diet.  So I used rice milk instead of regular milk, egg replacement instead of eggs and canola oil instead of veggie oil.  It turned out WONDERFULLY!! Don't omit the coffee, it is the special ingredient! I didn't use frosting and it was just great!  Thanks so much :)

This was the first cake I ever learned to make from scratch when I was about 8 years old. It's easy, its cheap (no vanilla and cocoa instead of some expensive chcolate) and it just a great cake. I was so excited when I found it last week that I've made it twice since. I cut the recipe in half and make it in a square pan. I actually just dump all the ingrediants in a bowl no "making the well" no "dry then wet" and it just comes out great no matter what. I used a canned chocolate cream cheese frosting and then I used canned coconut pecan, it was taaaasteeeeey both ways. I have to get busy and find my old recipe for frosting that you just 'plop' in the middle of hot cake, wait and it frosts itself....

This was a VERY good cake! I only used 1/2 Cup coffee. I resifted the flour, put it in the strainer, and measured all the rest of the dry ingredients in the strainer, ran them thru the strainer, and then mixed them. I mixed all wet ingr. in another bowl too, then added them to the first and blended them together, stuch it in the oven AND......YUM YUM! I added a slightly heaping teasp. of instant coffee and 1/4 Cup of cocoa powder to a buttercream frosting recipe from a cookbook from the late 50's. Yum yum!

Super easy to make, good chocolate flavor , moist, enjoyed that it cooked and cooled to a flat top, so did not have to cut off dome to frost.  This recipe is a keeper and i'll never have to buy a boxed choc cake mix again!

Amazing cake! I combined the milk and vinegar and let sit for about 5 minutes so it became butter milk before adding to the batter.

Excellent cake recipe. I followed the ingredient list exactly. I mixed with my electric hand mixer 2 minutes. I baked @350 degrees in 2 round 9"  stainless (shiny not dark) cake pans for about 42 minutes - until a tooth pick came out clean. after pouring batter into pans I bang the on the counter to remove big air bubbles before baking. The cake came out light and moist - very good - will definitely make this again.

This is an easy and wonderful recipe to make. I followed the cake directions to a T. I made a creamy peanut butter frosting for it, which was so so. A white or chocolate buttercream would have been so much better.

I’ve used this recipe a few times now and the results are always consistent. Rich, chocolatey cake that’s always moist. I made no changes or substitutions, followed the recipe exactly as written and turns out every time. Great recipe!

Excellent! Paired with Nickie75's Fluffy Peanut Butter frosting. Per other reviews, I mixed the milk + vinegar 15 min. ahead of time (home made buttermilk). I mixed all dry ingredients, then add the wet (optional to add 1 tsp vanilla for deeper flavors), blended and baked two 8" rounds at 350 for 37 min. I added Duncan Hines whipped white frosting between layers and frosted with the aforementioned Fluffy PB Frosting. Yummy!

I am making a cake for an upcoming wedding. I made 3 different chocolate cake recipes. This was the favorite. One big plus, it stayed moist for up to 5 days after I baked it. 

Will be using this one and going by someone's suggestions by using cake flour and buttermilk.

I tried making it in two 9” cake rounds and it took only 15 minutes to bake over the edges and and burn around the edges. I’ll be going back to the tried and true Hershey’s cookbook.

Substituted King Arthur (KA) Gluten-free All-purpose Flour and added 1 1\2 Tablespoons of KA Cake Enhancer and about a cup of Ghiradeli's Semi-sweet chocolate chips.
Rich!  Oh, my it's rich.  I baked it as a Bundt cake, and everyone at work loved it.  The texture from the GF flour it a bit different, but not enough to do more than notice.  
Note: The batter rose higher than the top of the pan, so i probably should have used some of it for cupcakes or a small personal cake.

Be careful with springform pans--if your pans aren't tightly closed/gap-sealed, this batter is thin enough to potentially leak out onto your countertops after you fill your 9" springform pans.    You can seal any gaps with butter and flour or shortening (you probably know this--I remembered it last night as a telltale puddle spread across my countertop).   

This was serendipitous!   I like making cakes in my 13X9 pan, but my husband clamors for traditional round layer cakes.    The batter was quickly transferred to my 13X9 pan and into the oven it went.   Baking time was 29 minutes at 350 degrees  ( high altitude of 5439 feet)  and it turned out perfectly.    I put the pan on the cooling rack, slapped on the plastic lid, and went to bed.  

More serendipity!    The next morning I discovered that covering the steaming-hot cake pan had created an exceptionally moist cake.   Anyone baking at high altitudes has probably wrestled with DCS (dry cake syndrome) and I'm pleased to have discovered this potentially valuable technique.   

I made this recipe exactly as written, with the addition of an extra step (I combined the milk and the vinegar in a small bowl and allowed it to sour for 25 minutes) and a few small high-altitude modifications ( 2 cups of cake flour, 1 7/8 cup sugar, 7/8 cup cocoa powder, scant 2 tsp/scant 1 tsp of leavening agents, and an extra 1/4 cup of coffee).  As I write this, I'm debating what frosting recipe to make--my husband insists on chocolate frosting, b

I love this recipe it’s really easy to switch things up. I made it with coconut oil instead of veg oil and added 4 squares of baking chocolate and dark chocolate cocoa powder then my daughter for her first time ever used Godiva dark chocolate pudding mix and canola oil it came out great.

My husband's family is one where each group has their own traditional cake recipe that they whip out for special occasions. I needed a cake that could compete, and I've found it. I'm printing this one off and saving it forever. It's our family cake now.

This cake came out fluffy, moist, and rich. It was excellent slightly warm and still excellent the next day chilled in the fridge. It's stupid easy to make, proving sometimes the best things in life are the simplest. I paired it with the Chocolate Ganache recipe from INGRIDEVOGEL on this site. Best decision I've made in years.

I used all the ingredients in the recipe exactly, but I changed the process a little per some of the comments. Instead of dumping all the liquids directly into the dry, I first soured the milk with the vinegar for about 10 minutes until I saw solids forming. Then I finished whisking together all the liquids in their own bowl, made the well in the dry, and carried on as normal. I'm not sure if this made a difference to the cake, but it made it easier to mix. I used two 9" pans and baked for 30 minutes. The resulting layers were a good thickness. I let the cakes cool for a while then took them out of the pans and put them in the freezer for 10 minutes before putting the ganache on.

Comments regarding the stickiness of this cake in the pan are not to be ignored. The stickiness is REAL. I will use parchment paper in the future.

I loved how simple the recipe was. It’s foolproof! I already had the ingredients in my pantry and wanted to satisfy my craving for chocolate. This did not disappoint! The only difficulty I encountered was keeping my husband from eating the whole cake! I used a bundt pan instead of a 9x13 and it came out beautifully! No icing needed!

I will definitely make this cake again! It was so moist and fluffy and it melted in your mouth. I would suggest adding more flavours to make it taste a bit less like a boxed cake mix, 9/10!

Chocolate Allergies No More!!
I made Muffins :)
Delicious and Moist! Very easy to make. once I put it in the oven the very middle of each muffin  sunk and I was afraid I had done something wrong... at they cooked on the muffins rose and were beautiful . I didn't have vinegar but that didn't matter. I used all organic ingredients and 100% Organic  Cacao (pure coco) powder I purchased from of all places Walmart. I thought I was allergic to chocolate but instead I was allergic to chocolate that is processed badly and has harmful additives.  Organic Cacao also makes wonderful hot chocolate as well.

I followed all directions for the ingredients.  Instead of baking just on cake I used two 9 inch rounds and baked for around 20 minutes.  I did also use the suggested frosting recipe and it was Awesome.

The flavor was really good, the coffee really added something to it.we put a nutella cream between the layers and frosted with vanilla butter cream. My only complaint is that it is almost too moist, even after the toothpick came out clean it was crumbly just because it had a lot of moisture, not a big deal, it tasted amazing it just didn't look as nice as I would have wanted because of it.

This was a big hit when I made it for a relative's birthday.  Chocolate was the requested favorite flavor and I chose this recipe based on other reviews.  It came out great!!  Followed it exactly, as I usually do the first time I make it.  The only switch was lactose free milk instead of regular for those in my family who suffer from this.  Also, due to that, I opted out of the cream cheese frosting and instead used one in my recipes that is tolerable to everyone.  It was still all chocolate and still got rave reviews.  The brewed coffee gives it a rich flavor!  I will be making this again.  The only tip I have is that when using my stand mixer, I would recommend stirring the ingredients first.  Since everything goes in at once and you don't add ingredients one at a time, turning on the machine, even at the slowest stir speed, can throw it everywhere.  If you stir it first, it will all combine nicely.

This is a delicious, moist cake. Another review suggested mixing items beginning at the bottom of the ingredients list and working your way up.  This worked well in breaking up the dry ingredients.  Many reviews mentioned this is a sticky cake and hard to get out of the pan.  I used Bakers Joy and sprayed it very liberally into a bundt pan.  The result was a beautiful, perfectly intact cake.

I didn't make any changes to this basic chocolate cake recipe and it turned out fantastic just the way it is. It was surprisingly rich, moist and chocolatey for something so simple. The only thing worth noting was that I used a dark roast coffee pod for the coffee, and I stuck it in my freezer until I needed to add it in. it was only room temperature by then, and not specifically "cold" as the recipe called for. I will be making this again (and again, and again...)

Very good and super easy! Thanks for sharing. I really liked this recipe because it was very easy to do.I used buttermilk instead of milk and vinegar. Other than that I followed the recipe and it turned out great. I will make this cake again.

Wow!  Moist and delicious.  I substituted unsweetened almond milk for milk and red wine vinegar for vinegar.  This went over well at church this morning.

The cake turned out great! As recommended by many, I used cake flour and whipping cream instead and that helped with the texture. I doubled the recipe and stacked the 2 cakes to give it more height and covered with a beautiful ganache. I would maybe do 1.5x recipe instead as the cake batter was too much for 2 nine inch pans - it took longer than 45 mins to cook and there was some overflow at the edges. Will also brush some kahlua over it before the ganache to up the moisture and flavour.

This was a really good cake.  
I would make it again because it was fast and easy, but I would add more cocoa and a bit more sugar. I would also consider a different recipe if you're looking for a decadent-super-chocolaty cake.

If you're looking for a recipe that is quick and doesn't taste half bad then give this one a try but if I'm going to make a cake from scratch I'd really prefer that it didn't taste and look like it came from a box.

Do not use a spring form pan. This is very thin batter and will leak out. That being said, it is a very good cake and I'm picky about my baking.

I added 1 Cup of cocoa and 1 Tbsp of instant coffee to the hot water as per others suggestions.  Cake was excellent- family couldn't get enough of it.  It was not dense,  consistency reminded me of cake box cake.  I didn't have best quality cocoa available to use ( used Fry's)  it was ok.  I don't like coffee so was wary of adding in coffee but no hint of coffee flavour on eating.  Batter was very thin as previously reported.

Absolutely wonderful chocolate cake!  And very easy. Great  smooth, moist texture and easy to handle layers.  I  used dark chocolate cocoa powder....superb flavor!  Will not need any other recipe for chocolate cake  ever again.

Made this with my kids. Used only 1.5 cups sugar, and no coffee. Subbed water to keep it simple. Ended up using a square 9"x9" cake pan. Made a thick cake. But took about an hour in the oven for a fork to come out clean. Turned out spongey in a good way, and not too sweet. The crust got a bit gooey which I like.

Sorry, I did not taste any "chocolate heaven" and it is certainly not "to die for" as others described here.  About the same flavor as a chocolate cake mix in a box.

Very rich moist cake! I did substitute buttermilk for regular milk, I used hot coffee instead of cold, and I don't care for icing, so I mixed 1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder and 1 tablespoon powdered  sugar sprinkled on top. The best part is it was so easy to make.

A delicious and rich cake. I would not recommend this recipe if you need to remove the cake from the pan. The batter is very thin and the cake is sticky. I ruined a pan cake, but the recipe worked well for cupcakes.

This was the best chocolate cake I've ever made! I added 3/4 cup of chocolate chips to the batter at the end. It was very moist and came out perfect with homemade chocolate frosting. I made it for a friends birthday and everyone was blown away by how delicious it was!

I've been using this recipe for several years now and it's wonderful just as written. I increase the cocoa to 1 cup and add 1 teaspoon of vanilla because we like it that way. My experience has been that it's a very moist and tender cake so I highly recommend using parchment in the bottom of your pan, especially if making a layer cake. If you haven't tried this recipe yet, DO IT!! You won't be sorry!!! Thanks for sharing, Kelly!!

I've made this cake multiple times now, using a coffee substitute (Pero) instead.  It comes out amazing, rivaling any store bought cake.  Super moist and rich.  Be sure to line your pan with wax paper for easier removal.  I use a springform pan to ensure this. I baked at 325'F for 45 min.  Test with a toothpick to test for doneness. Fabulous!

I guess I made it.  I used gluten-free flour, and only used 1-3/4 cups because it was all I had; and substituted powdered sugar since I was out of regular sugar.   Stuck to the rest of the recipe but threw in some chocolate chips for fun and baked 30 minutes.  Great surprise!  Can't give it a 5-star because it's a mutant.

Excellent!  I love the deep cocoa flavor.  The only change I made was decreasing the sugar to 1 1/2 cups instead of 2.  I over baked it a bit and thought it would be dry but it was so moist.  I topped it with German chocolate frosting (from this site).  It didn't taste like a box mix at all, as noted from another reviewer.  This recipe has a denser crumb unlike light and feathery from a box mix.

Made this twice.  Everyone loved it.  Moist and delicious. I always put less sugar (1 1/2 cup) and use half white sugar and brown.  Will definately make again.

I added 75g baker's chocolate, replaced 50g flour with 50g whole wheat flour and used coconut oil. In addition, I only added 150g sugar, and I felt it was delicious. That's a bit healthier.

This was the first chocolate cake I've ever made from scratch. The recipe seems quite idiot proof, but I accidentally poured an extra teaspoon or so of white vinegar right as I was starting to mix the batter, so I added an extra 1/4 c of sugar to balance it out. I'm not sure if that made the difference but boy was the reward good! It was so moist and the crumb was perfect. We baked for 40 minutes, let it cool, and then topped it simply with caramel and some pre made sweet&spicy pecans. It would  have been fine without icing at all.

Made this exactly as written for my moms birthday dinner and everyone loved it, even my picky husband who was sceptical of the "dark chocolate" title (he doesn't like dark chocolate). Served it with vanilla ice cream and strawberries. Next time I think I'll add a shot of vanilla, I was surprised there wasn't any in it.  Yummy, super quick and easy, will make again :)

This was a simple one bowl recipe that turned out better than I ever expected.  Add a chocolate buttercream frosting and this is to die for.  It came out light and fluffy with lots of chocolate flavour.  I sprinkled the top with some dried coconut.

Awesome recipe! I baked the cake in a 9.5 inch dish with all listed ingredients halved, and substituted coffee with Earl Grey tea (since I don't drink coffee). It worked out perfectly fine. It's easy to make too!

Really good. I halved it so we would not have so much temptation in the house. As many Allrecipes cooks do, I made a couple of changes, but merely out of necessity. We had no coffee to add so I added Rootbeer instead. Perfectly fine substitution. Also, just had white whole wheat flour. Surprisingly, it is not noticeable and I would do it again if needed. No frosting, just some powdered sugar. Very nice everyday baking recipe. I promised the kids we would bake and bake we did. Everyone was satisfied.

Amazing recipe .. Made this for my husbands birthday last week but with one change- halving the sugar content to one cup and it turned out do well !! Iced it with the dark chocalate cream cheese( used fat free cream cheese, topped with some grated orange zest) and the result was sheer heavenly decadence!! My husband called it the best dark chocalate cake he had ever had and my kids couldn't stop at 2 pieces at a time. My sis in law loved it too and will be passing this along to her as well! Absolute 5 stars- hands down!!

Moist and delicious!!  I've found reading reviews is a must for this site.  I followed the suggestion of using buttermilk instead of milk & delete vinegar and also used two 9" round pans.  I used the choc cheese frosting recipe by Carol and used the "Expert Chocolate Mousse" recipe as filling.  Unbelievably delicious and received many kudos!    Great chocolate cake recipe!

This cake was super moist and yummy.  It was a little sunken in in the middle, but since I don't care much about the way it looked, I gave it a 5-star rating on taste.  I made it for my daughter's 6th birthday party and everybody seemed to love it.  I used the Creamy Chocolate Frosting recipe from this site which worked well with it.

Everyone seems to like this cake. I think it's okay--could be more...distinctive tasting? But it's a crowdpleaser nonetheless. Also--I made this into mini-muffins once and they stuck to the pan horribly. Use liners.

Delicious, I made this cake as written with the chocolate frosting recipe on the cocoa can. My husband and the rest of our family loved it and craved it still after it was gone. Yummy!

Fantastic! Made (almost) exactly as directed, just made it non-dairy by using soy milk. Moist, rich but not too heavy, classic chocolate cake. I also loved how quickly it came together.

Tried it twice, turned out quite nice both times. It's a great recipe to have for a quick no-fuss, minimal- mess cake. It does taste like boxed cake  mix, but it's also not more of a hassle to make than box mix, you can tweak it easily to satisfy your tastes and you know exactly what's in it. I don't get the reviewers raving like crazy about the taste, though; it's not bad by any means, especially for a one-bowl cake, but you can tell there's no actual chocolate in it (cocoa butter is irreplaceable).

This recipe helped me make the best cupcakes of my life! I only added an extra 1/4 cup of cocoa (i used hershey's dark cocoa powder) and when they finished baking I scooped out the centers and stuffed them with cherries. "Dark Chocolate Covered Cherry cupcakes". :) I also made homemade dark chocolate whipped cream for frosting and topped with sprinkles! Everyone RAVED!  I will be keeping this recipe. Mmmmmmmmm!

Oh my heavenly chocolate!! I made cupcakes using this recipe with one small change. I mixed the vinegar and milk then let it sit for about 5 minutes before mixing in. I do this with pancakes too! These are delicious without anything on it, vanilla buttercream only makes it more amazing.

This cake is simply divine! The only thing I did differently is mix the dry and wet ingredients separately, then combined them. (old school):-)  I'm sure it would have also turned out nicely by mixing it as directed. Super moist and delicious! What a cake!!

This really is a VERY easy recipe - I made it exactly as shown, and it came out super-moist, with a great, not-too-sweet chocolate flavor. Topped it with powdered sugar. The only variation was that with my oven, it took a few minutes longer baking, but came out great. Highly recommended!!

I was very excited to try this recipe but I found it fell short. I followed the recipe exactly as described and I did get a super moist spongy cake, however there was no flavour to it. It seems like all the ingredients cancelled each other out and it tasted like nothing. I usually like a rich cocoa flavour, but this cake just left a sugary aftertaste. The only way to give this cake flavour is to add frosting to it, which I am not a fan of. Disappointed:-(

This cake was FABULOUS!!  Very rich and moist ... And still that moist 3 days later!  The only item of note is that I used 2% milk as that is what I had on hand at home.   Very easy to make.  I topped it with a chocolate ganache drizzle.  This one is a keeper!

OMG!!! I followed this recipe exactly as written. This is the only time I'll review a recipe, since I think it's the only way to give it an accurate assessment. I was actually a little concerned that I uses 1% milk, but it's the only kind we buy. Let me say this is the best chocolate cake I have ever tasted. I will never buy a chocolate cake mix again. The cake didn't fall, I was very careful not to bump the cake pan and, as another reviewer suggested, I didn't pull out the rack when I tested it. I used a dark 9x13 pan so set the timer at 30 minutes instead of 35. Touched the cake at the front end, it bounced back. Then I inserted a toothpick in the middle, and it came out dry. I immediately removed the cake very carefully (I surely didn't want it to fall). Another thing, I wasn't sure if I should use a mixer, so after I stirred all the dry ingredients in the large bowl with a whisk to make sure it was all blended, added the rest of the ingredients (liquid) and proceeded to mix it with the whisk. After it was thoroughly blended I counted 50 strokes then poured into my pan which was sprayed with non-stick spray. This is the moistest, tastiest, easiest cake to make and will forever be my go to chocolate cake. I frosted it with the white frosting I've made all my life. Just confectioner's sugar, a little butter, capful of vanilla and milk. AWESOME!!

I bake and decorate cakes as hobby, and this is my favorite recipe for a chocolate cake that I have found so far. It beats out Martha Stewart, Emeril's, and the Cake Boss Buddy Valastro's chocolate cake hands down. It very good just as is with no changes. So if you're just doing a double layer 8" round I wouldn't change anything. Unless  you don't like a dark chocolate cake. If you plan to carve this cake add a 1/2 cup of flour otherwise it to soft to do much with. If you don't like a dark chocolate just cut back to 1/2 cup of cocoa it will be more like a devil food cake.

i tried this recipe this week. it was really very easy to prepare. all in one bowl recipe is a real time saver. i added some crushed almonds and turkish nuts. i also added 2 tea spoons of bailey's. each cupcake mould took approximately 1/4 cup of the batter and as a result i had 11 cupcakes (i used half of the original recipe). i needed only 22-23 minutes baking time with my silicone cupcake moulds.

cupcakes came out nicely leavened. they were dark, tempting and very moisty. yet, i had this wierd after taste and i think it was because of the baking soda. i served them with vanilla icecream on the side and it tasted better that way. i also served some with strawberry jam frosting and they were a lot better.

This cake is great if you are careful to when you turn off the oven. If you leave the oven on for a little to long the cake will come out dry and taste less.

I have struggled for quite some time finding a moist but yet easy chocolate cake. THIS IS IT. I made this for my husband with a very light peanut butter frosting and he ate just about the entire cake in less than 3 days. I will make it again and again. FYI - I even got away with using only 1.5 cups of sugar and it still was wonderful

Eh. Makes for a fairly tasteless cake, I had to add a filling to my cupcakes to add a much needed flavour boost. Really disappointed!

I made this cake but used sour cream instead of the milk, used white vinegar and coffee as suggested, no baking powder, baked at 360-370 for 40 minutes. Awesome results. It rose in the middle without any problems. If I were decorating I would use a lower temperature to make it flatter. Great recipe.

The cake was excellent. I would suggest to put slightly less coffee as it is a chocolate cake.the cake was moist and was a big hit in the family.

Easy and delicious! I didn't have any vinegar on hand, so I subbed lemon juice instead to have something acidic. The cake turned out just fine.

I just made this cake yesterday for my boyfriend's birthday and it tasted absolutely heavenly!

I used a 9" round tin, but I think it was too small as the batter filled up about 2/3 of the tin and started to overflow once I started baking it. (I put a separate tin on the rack below to catch the falling batter, and what resulted in that tin tasted heavenly too). I'm not sure if it's because I filled up too much of the tin or if it's the batter that expands a lot, but it's something to take note of.

I also followed one of the reviewers' ideas and put choc chips into the batter but they ended up sinking to the bottom of the tin because of the thin (and less dense) batter. So when I removed the cake from the tin, a whole chocolatey chunk of it was stuck to the bottom and my cake had a concave surface. Had to cut a 1 cm layer off to make it level. Wouldn't recommend anyone to put choc chips!

I also greased the tin then dusted it with cocoa powder instead of flour (a great idea from another reviewer!), cut the cake into three layers, slathered Kraft's marshmallow creme in between and frosted with Pillsbury's pre-mixed vanilla frosting (which was a little too sweet).

Hope this helps! The cake was really awesome. Enjoy!

I made this cake the other night for my husbands birthday. Yummy! Moist and perfect. So easy that I will never make a box cake again. It was a hit. I filled it with a raspberry filling and frosted it with a chocolate butter cream frosting. Yum.

Wow. I took this to work and everyone loved it.  I did add a pack of instant chocolate pudding which made it chewy like a brownie and frosted it with a chocolate/coffee icing.  Thanks for the great recipe. Chocolate and Coffee - what a pair!

This was a wonderful recipe!  I used some regular cocoa and some dark chocolate cocoa.  The cake turned out moist, dense, and chewy.  I used a chocolate fudge frosting on top.  I received rave reviews from all who ate it.

DELICIOUS!!  I followed the recipe exactly, and this is one of the best, if not the best chocolate cakes I've had!!  I made it for my mom for her birthday, along with the German Chocolate Frosting II from this site, and she LOVED it!  My husband has now requested it for his birthday, which isn't until January :)  I highly recommed this cake with the frosting!!  Wow!

This recipe is fantastic. I followed it to a T, and it worked fine - didnt bother with buttermilk as suggested, and it was fine - very moist, even better the next day, and it forms a nice fudgy layer. The cake is quite sticky, so best to line tray with parchment paper to avoid tearing the cake. I poured into muffin papers, and used Nutella as frosting before covering with rainbow sprinkles for my son's birthday party - a huge hit

Definitely as advertised! Rich, moist and delicious. Very dense chocolate flavor. I made it exactly as recipe stated. This is an excellent recipe for any chocolate type cake. I used it for German Chocolate this time, but I will try it with chocolate frosting and vanilla buttercream. Definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing.

I followed this recipe almost exactly - only adding a teaspoon of vanilla.  It came out horribly!   The cake was concave (I didn't move it at all during baking time) and tasted very bland, more coffee flavor than anything else.  It also stuck to the cake pan even though I liberally greased and floured it.  Won't be trying this one again.

This is a fabulous chocolate cake and easy.  The ultimate compliment came from my 7-year old granddaughter who said "This is good...This is VERRRRY good" and asked me to make it for her next birthday.  I added a scant bit less than 2 cups of sugar, 1/2 cup of applesauce instead of oil to make it more calorie friendly and frosted it with the Caramel Frosting I by MaryKaye from this site.  Dangerlously YUMMY!

I was a little nervous about the vinegar, and it seemed like it would be too much baking soda, but I made the recipe almost exactly as directed, and it was excellent!!  The only changes I made were 1 cup cocoa, hot coffee (didn't want to wait!), and dusted the pan with cocoa instead of flour. The chocolate flavor was definitely there, it had a great texture, it was moist, dark, just perfect.  I'm very sensitive to the taste of baking soda and couldn't taste it at all!  I made it one day and frosted and served it the next.

It was OK.  If I could give it 3 1/2 stars, I would.  I gave it four stars because it was very easy and my husband thought it was good.  I just didn't think it was super moist nor chocolatey, and I did increase the cocoa to one cup, and used cake flour.  It just didn't have much flavor.  I used a chocolate buttercream icing and thought that was the best part(and I'm not an icing lover). One problem might have been that my husband used the last of the veg. oil making crab rangoon the night before, so I had to use light-tasting olive oil. If I make it again I'll definitely do it in 2 layers so I can put icing between them. I do think the german chocolate icing might make it better. I'd still much rather have my mother's chocolate sheet cake, but it's much more time-consuming to make, so I'll probably keep this recipe since it's so easy and just experiment with it to see if I can make it taste better.

Fantastic!  I make it in a bundt pan, and sometimes either sprinkle icing sugar on it when it's cooled, or serve with raspberry coulis.  MMM!

Delicious!  I made this for my husband's birthday with peanut butter frosting.  I used a cup of buttermilk instead of milk and deleted the vinegar.  I used two 9 inch pans.

This cake is ok.  It is moist and has a wonderful texture.  That being said, it does not have a very strong chocolate flavor and it lacks sweetness.  If I make this again I'll have to make some adjustments.  If you want a wonderful dark choc-cake try the "Simple 'N' Delicious Chocolate Cake" from this site.

Delicious! My boyfriend and I were craving cake and he offered to make some but complained that we didn't have any boxed mix. Of course chocolate cake is best when made from scratch so I looked for a simple recipe and threw this one at him before he changed his mind.   It turned out to be the best chocolate cake I've ever had and my boyfriend is warming up to baking from scratch!

This is such an awesome dark chocolate cake! It came out sooo good & fudgey!! I was a little worried about using vinegar & coffee since I've never used either in a cake recipe before but it came out great! I made it this cake for my brother who's a chocoholic & he loved it!! I frosted it with white chocolate buttercream frosting & it was delicious!! This will be the cake recipe I will use for his b-day from now on!! Thanks for the awesome recipe!

The all-in-one-bowl was making me doubt this recipe but it turned out great! The cake cut to perfection, the texture was awesome and it was so chocolatey. The only reason i gave it 4 stars was i felt it needs a glaze/frosting. Thankyou for ending my search for a great cake recipe. ps: i didnt have vinegar so i replaced it with lemon juice

I love this recipe!!! You can definitely taste the chocolate, but it isn't too sweet so even if you aren't a huge chocolate lover you can still enjoy this cake. I agree with one of the reviewers that you should make this cake the day/night before for best results. Since I made this cake the first time I have had three requests to make it again and have not had to make any adjustments to the recipe. Thanks to whoever posted this recipe =D

this cake was really good. it had a nice texture and stayed moist. It sat out on the counter with a lid overtop and still stayed soft for about 4 days (that is-until it was completely gone) i also upped the amount of cocoa from 3/4 cup to a full cup. I made it in two 9 in round pans and it took about a half hour to cook. i was really careful when i tested it and didnt have any problems with the cake falling in on itself. 
i used a chocolate frosting recipe from this site and made a raspberry sauce. The raspberry sauce was delicious and complimented this cake perfectly.

Add chocolate chips!!!!!!!!!  That is my only suggestion to make this more heavenly.  Don't worry about the very runny batter; it just makes it moist.  I used this with a chocolate ganache recipe (very easy to make), and it is like a chocolate lover's dream.

This recipe is perfect just as it is. I am in Kenya and this is where I baked it for the first time, so am not sure if the low altitude had anything to do with it. It came out soft and moist and tasting like heaven. I love the far-away taste that the coffee has when eating the cake. My family and friends are nuts over this recipe. I used the german cake frosting and it goes perfectly. This cake is truly a sinful chocolate cake. Yum!

I followed the recipe exactly, used Ghirardelli cocoa, and was just not that impressed. Did not have a very intense chocolately flavor. It was very easy to make, just as easy as a mix, but tasted about the same as a mix, too.

I don't eat chocolate and I haven never made a cake before but my chocolaholic boyfriend's b-day is coming up and I secretly invited a bunch of my girlfriends over for chocolate cake tasting. I made the "Too much chocolate cake" from this site and "Dark Chocolate Cake II".  This one was an absolute winner!!  They all raved about it!  I replaced milk and vinegar with buttermilk and regular flower with cake flower as per other reviewers' suggestion. I used two 9" cake pans because I didn't want to cut it horizontally to add the frosting.  I baked it for 30 minutes, let it cool for about an hour, covered both layers with "German Chocolate Cake Frosting II" and put them together.  Now, I didn't even try it but apparently it was DELICIOUS, so I am making this for the b-day party! Thank you for a great and easy recipe!

I made this cake last weekend for my birthday, it was a success!!!! everybody love it! I had a problem though: I didn't expect the dough to be kind of "liquid", so it spilled a bit out of the pan when cooking (as I expected when I saw the density of it) but I didn't want to add extra flour. I think the eggs I used were a little bit larger than those in the recipe. But as I said the cake is great! so dark, moist and not too sweet. From now on I'll have it as my favorite chocolate cake recipe. Thanks for sharing!

I liked this but my boyfriend was not a fan. I would add some dark chocolate chips next time, I bet it would add a richer flavour. Not bad, not great.

My husband doesn't usually like the taste of cake without frosting and he said this recipe stood on its own. I made a layer cake with two 9" cake pans, baking it for 35 minutes at 350 degrees and it turned out great - no sinking centers. Frosting it with a chocolate buttercream recipe I found on here was a bit of a challenge; the consistency of the frosting kept ripping up bits of the cake. However, the taste of this moist, rich & fluffy cake mixed with the bittersweet sugary goodness of the frosting turned out to be positively perfect. I used my workplace as guinea pigs and the cake was gone within the hour. I got so many compliments, this recipe is going into my arsenal for sure.

Excellent! I followed the suggestion of using buttermilk instead of regular milk and omitting the vinegar. I made 2 cakes for my high school students and they LOVED it - said it was much better than any store-bought cake! THANKS!

One of the best chocolate cakes, I've ever made.  I tripled this recipe to make it sheet cake size added 1/2c more cocoa, added 1 cup instant pudding 2 packages of chocolate chips and 2 cups sour cream.  This made it sinfully moist and chocolaty It was a hit at the anniversary party I took it too.  Topped with a drizzle of fudgy and peanut butter glazes

This is my favorite chocolate cake recipe! Didn't have to change anything.   I am a teacher and I love to bake and when I brought this to school, everybody loved it!  I always ice with cream cheese frosting and it is a great combo.

I made this cake for my fiance's birthday and it was a big hit.  I can't rate the frosting though, because he wanted it done with peanut butter frosting.  Everyone loved it, and it went in record time.

All the reviews I read were about how delicious and easy this cake was to make. I made it just like the recipe and it overflowed in my stove then sunk in the middle... maybe it was because I live at a high altitude... I don't know. Everyone liked the flavor but it wasn't as great as I expected and was really heavy.

A perfect textured chocolate cake. I also subbed the milk & vinegar for buttermilk (like my grandma does) and the cake was perfect. Buttered & floured the pan & the cake came out like a dream. I used "Chocolate Cheese Frosting" but next time will use a fudgier-type frosting. Delicious!

I have to be honest...I'm not crazy about this cake.  It's subtle, but I don't like the flavor that the coffee lends to it.  I followed the recipe exactly, and it comes out very moist.  Good texture, but the flavor is just off.  It needs frosting or a handful of milk chocolate chips to mask it and add the sweetness I was looking for.

This was truly the best made from scratch chocolate cake I have ever had. I did make 2 changes. 1. I elimated the vinegar. 2. Used buttermilk instead of regular milk. Awesome, Awesome, Awesome cake. You've got to try it.

I didn't have enough milk so I used buttermilk and left out the vinegar as another reviewer had suggested.  I used my bundt pan and made a simple cocoa icing flavored with cold coffee and it turned out MOIST and so yummy.  The perfect chocolate fix!  Great with a glass of red wine too!

This cake was a big hit at a going away picnic. I added the extra 1/4 cup and used instant coffee instead of brewed. I made 2 batches enough for a 10 inch round cake and filled with rasberry and covered with chocolate butter cream. everyone said it was delicious and moist. The center did sink a little but if you level your cakes anyway it is not that big of a deal. Next time I will try the buttermilk suggestion and compare

This cake was good, but a little dry.  I baked it according to directions and kept checking it, but still was a bit dry. Flavor was not as chocolatey as I would like either.

I haven't sliced and tasted the cake yet. But I'm so excited that it isn't a soggy mess. this is the 2nd time I'm trying this recipe - and this time, I've followed it exactly. Oh, except I added chopped walnuts because i had some in the fridge. 

First time I tried this recipe I melted a 200gm bar of cooking chocolate (being the over-zealous chocoholic that I am)into it and used 3 small eggs to make up for not having large eggs. Big mistake. Mixture was very wet and took ages to bake. When i tried to turn the cake out, it fell apart because it was still soggy at the bottom. I had to scrape the soggy stuff out and pat it into smaller, mishapen squares, to bake again. it actually tasted pretty yummy - a little crusty, very chewy and chocolatey, but I don't think that's the point. I wanted a cake.

Well I'm going back to the kitchen to taste my cake!!! I will never deviate or try to add to much to any recipe that has been so well reviewed.

Fabulous.  I tasted the batter before I poured it into the pan and almost ate the whole bowl.  Made this in 2 9" round cake pans, used Dark Chocolate Ganache Icing from this site because I really wanted this to be a dark, not overly sweet cake.  It would probably still be delicious with a lighter, sweeter icing (guess I'll have to make another one to test!)  Cake itself was moist, rich, and lovely.  Considering I'm a pretty inexperienced baker, I'd say this recipe deserves every star I can give it!

A surprisingly dark chocolate cake considering you are using cocoa.  I used Ghirardelli.  I also whole-heartedly agree with the reviewer that substituted buttermilk for the milk and cake flour -- I did the same and also omitted the vinager.  I also baked in a bundt pan for 40 minutes and it came out a little underdone -- my mistake for not testing it but we were trying to get out the door so I took my chances.  I don't think this requires frosting -- we are enjoying it with a dollop of whipped cream or some vanilla ice cream would be nice.  This is an easy, no fail recipe from what I can see.  Go for it!

I follwed this recipe exactly, except that I baked it in a bundt pan. I had to bake it for about 20 minutes longer. Not sure if that was the difference, but it was pretty dry. I used a high quality Dutch Cocoa and the chocolate flavor of the cake was great. I was just hoping for a moist cake and this cake wasn't.

What a great recipe! I made this for a friend's birthday party and it was a SMASH. I topped with strawberry/cream cheese frosting and fresh strawberries. Not a piece was left. Moist and yummy. I actually threw in a handful of chocolate chips too. The birthday boy is a chocoholic.

Extremely moist, rich cake. Loved it. Mine did turn out a little less sweet than the way I like it, so I sliced it down the middle creating two layers, and then sliced those in half to create 4 thin layers. I laid them one on top of the other, layering the bottom three with seedless raspberry preserves, and then topped it off with a chocolate frosting (microwave 1/2 cup whipping cream on high for a minute and stir in 1 cup of semisweet chocolate morsels) for a dark chocolate raspberry surprise cake.
My little cousins couldn't get enough of it!

FABULOUS!  This cake was soooo light and moist.  The chocolate flavor was intense, but not too rich.  I frosted with a chocolate buttercream (Baker's One Bowl Frosting recipe).  This will be our birthday cake from now on!

Nice dark color and moistness, but needs more chocolatey oomph. I used Pernigotti cocoa, so that ingredient is not the issue; to be fair, I also substituted powdered buttermilk, since I was out of regular milk. Was looking for a chocolate cake that can stand on its own and does not need frosting. Luckily, I had some leftover dark chocolate ganache and used it as a topping.

WELL.. it looks good, smells great, nice and moist, deep dark chocolate cake.  BUT I had a tiny little problem and I"m sure it's all my own doings?  Instead of milk I added a cup of cream and my cake fell. hehehehe

Next time I will follow the directions better and not try to add to it on my own.  I am going to put a piece of cake in the bowl, a scoop of icecream and drizzle with hot fudge!! YUMMM

I liked the coffee addition to this flavor, but it was not chocolate enough for my liking.  I also did not find this cake to be as moist as many of the other reviewers.  In my quest for the untimate chocolate cake, this one will not make the finals.

This was definitely easy to make so I gave it 4 stars, but the cake wasn't as moist as I hoped it would be.  The flavor was great though.  Used the chocolate cream cheese frosting from this site - awesome.

The cake was excellent!!! Only changes made: adding some almond extract, and I mistakenly used double the cocoa (I halved the rest of the recipe in order to bake in a loaf pan). Was perfect in 56 minutes anyway. Easy ingredients, easy to make. Next time I will try a cream cheese frosting. (*this was my first time using vinegar in a recipe like this: and it worked)

Great cake with a deep, dark flavor.  The only problem was mine.  I didn't grease/flour the pans (I used 2 9" rounds which otherwise would have worked wonderfully) well enough and the cakes completely stuck. So....pulled out the trifle bowl, broke it further in chunks and layered it with chocolate sauce and some whipped cream I flavored with coffee.  Topped it with the whipped cream and chocolate chips....OMG...to die for.  I think the next time I make this, I'll "screw up" again!!

This is a good moist cake. I topped with the chocolate cheese frosting from this site and it was a great combo! The best part it is so easy. Just mix and dump in the pan!

This cake was moist and flavourful, as well as easy to make.  It baked and served nicely.  I served it with "Cinnamon Coffee Frosting" from allrecipes.com, which I would recommend.

Delicious and moist despite the fact that my oven quit working midway through the baking process!  Turned it on again (it's gas) and the cake was fine.  Tip: Make the cup of coffee BEFORE you do anything else, so it will be cold by the time you're ready to add it to the dry ingredients.

Perfect! Easy, moist, husband and son approved. Delicious on its own or with chocolate icing. Now if I could just restrain myself from sneaking bites of cake--it's disappearing fast!

This recipe was great!! Very easy to make, and the cake turned out really moist and rich - utterly delicious! I found that 1-1/4 cups of sugar and just 1/2 cup cocoa were sufficient for a rich, flavorful cake. However, it took longer to bake than the recipe provides for. Next time I might try to cut down on the coffee, since 1 whole cup seems a bit excessive. Even so, best cake I ever made!

Super easy and good.  I have used the following changes with success (but not at the same time):  adding 1/2 cup shredded coconut, substituting 1 cup of flour for 1 cup ground almonds (makes a much denser cake), using 1/2 cup coffee and 1/2 cup kahlua (good!).

Make sure you do not add coconut flakes or substatute water for the coffee. It makes the cake very gooey and yucky.I tried to improvise, but it came out awful. Next time I make coffee I will have to try it again. I just don't make it much. But I gave it 38's because it's chocolate :)

Absolutely the best chocolate cake I have ever made/had.  I was a bit leery with the vinegar in it, but it was amazing!  I made this for my son's 6th birthday and frosted it.  I realized that it didn't need frosting at all, in fact, many of the kids (as well as myself) scraped the frosting off and just ate the cake!!  Next time I make it (and there will be a next time!) I may sprinkle it with some powdered sugar or something, but it is perfect just the way it is.

Excellent recipe.  Don't be turned-off by the coffee if you don't like coffee, it doesn't taste like coffee.  It has a very rich chocolate flavor.  It is a very moist cake.  This cake is just right, simple, tasty and quick. Thank you for putting the recipe on the web.
