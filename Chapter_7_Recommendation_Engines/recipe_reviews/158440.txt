Oh so good! Didn't look like it would be but it was amazing! I would have started the meat before the potatoes though as it took longer. I also used beef since I had it on hand, corn instead of carrots, added a little extra worcestershire sauce and used the IKEA meatball gravy mix. The whole family was quiet while gobbling it down. The 2 yr old came back after dinner to clean her plate and the picky 5 yr old asked for more!

Yeah, its shepherds pie, so its not the most exotic thing you can put on the table. But it is quick, easy, and one of the most flavorful shepherds pie I have had. I did use all "optional" ingredients to put as much flavor in as possible.  Long story short - quick, easy, tasty. If the family doesn't like it let them cook for themselves!

First of all, YUMMY!!  My family of 6 loved it. I thought there would be some leftover, but we ate it all. The family said, “This one is a keeper!” I had to make some changes, just because I did not have them available to at this time. I didn’t use lamb, not something I buy; also I didn’t have any fresh mushroom or a can of baked beans. I used pork and bean instead.  I also made the mistake of using instant potatoes. I will defiantly use real mashed potatoes next time.  EXCELENT PIE!! Thanks for the recipe!!

Very liquidy but good - might pass on the baked beans next time in lieu of green beans, personal preference.  Kids loved it (over and over again...made a LOT of food).  Great flavor!

So wasn't expecting the great feedback! So thank you all very much! This really is a versatile recipe, and the great thing is that when you swap out the lamb mince for beef mince, you just change the name from shepherds pie to cottage pie :0)
The mince base is also really great with a jacket potatoe or in a bowl with a piece of crusty bread. It's what our family calls a rib coater, great on cold nights.

I made this for dinner tonight and my picky husband went for 3rds! Unheard of!

However, I did not use ground lamb, $8.99 a pound was just too expensive so I used ground beef.  That technically does not make it a shepherds pie I know, but it was delicious anyway. Other then that, I followed the recipe exactly.

Thanks for this great recipe.

Simple and yummy! I used ground beef, added corn and peas since I didn't have mushrooms on hand. I didn't have brown gravy mix either, but didn't miss it. It came out warm, comforting and delish. A family hit!

Very good starting point. Had to modify for a picky fam- used beef rather than lamb. Corn rather than carrots and left out the beans/diced tomatoes. Still flavorful- love the addition of the Worcestershire sauce!

I loved this! I added more seasoning to the beef (just garlic powder and S/P), made the mash without milk cause I didn't have any and made peas and carrots on the side! It was so good! Even my mom went in for seconds and that's rare! thank you so much for the recipe.
