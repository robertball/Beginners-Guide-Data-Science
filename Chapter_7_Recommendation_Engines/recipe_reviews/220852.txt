I didn’t think this recipe would work because it didn’t require soaking the beans before cooking, but it does work. The beans were cooked after 12 minutes, so I never needed to cook them the last five minutes. I added a jalapeno and two bay leaves. This recipe is quite trustworthy. Thank you for sharing it with us.
