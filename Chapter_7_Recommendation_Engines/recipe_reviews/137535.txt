I've made many different hummus recipies and was starting to get burnt out.  Then Fusion Hummus came along!  I love the difference with the balsamic vinegar.  Have made it twice now and will definitely be making it more.  Second time I cut the olive oil to 2 Tbs to save some calories.  Also instead of the cold water, I used the reserved water from draining the garbanzo beans.

I didn't happen to have fresh sprigs of rosemary so I didn't add it and by the time I added the other ingredients adding the water would have made it to thin so I omitted that also. The taste was awesome, the balsamic did wonderful things to it.... my neighbors 2 year old went nuts over it.

Nice change to hummus-a fusion twist! I added crumbled feta cheese to this as well, which made a fabulous add in. Thanks for the new idea for an already awesome dish. It's fun to try new things, and this is definitely a keeper.

from recipe author:): I've started adding two tablespoons brown sugar and more garlic to pump up the flavor and balance everything out. Like reviewers have said, modify the balsamic if you're not big fan of the acidity. I'm not so good with the measurements of my recipes :/ I just throw everything in my processor so you may need to play around with the amounts I've given. I often don't add all the water depending on the consistency of the garbanzos from the can. I usually add it little by little and stop when it gets where I want it. Also, it tends to thicken a bit in the fridge as it sits because the beans absorb a little more but you can always add a little water or olive oil after it sits for awhile.

Interesting variation of regular hummus! I used the following modifications: half as much vinegar, added 2 tablespoons lemon juice, and substituted a can of black beans for one can of the garbanzo beans.

Ok - nice twist to regular hummus.  I also added feta cheese.  I only added the amount of vinegar suggested, however I felt it was a bit too much, next time will use less.

Awesome!  I used extra garlic and extra fresh rosemary from my garden, and I put a tad more Balsamic Vinegar.  I took it to a baby shower and served it with pita chips, baby carrots, and sliced red bell pepper.  Everyone loved it and several people asked me for the recipe!

Great recipe.  I made half the quantity but added the juice of half a lemon, instead of adding water, for that extra tang. This also eliminated the need for adding salt.

This is such a delicious recipe!  I haven't made hummus in awhile so I forgot the recipe that was in my head.  This was the first recipe in my search that came up and since I happen to have fresh rosemary growing in the garden, I figured I'd give it a try.  It's fresh, tasty and different, yet exactly what hummus should be.  The only modifications I made were by using white balsamic and added a little fresh parsley. I didn't end up using any water and it hasn't made it to the fridge yet.  I will be surprised if my husband gets any tonight when he comes home from work! Awesome recipe. Thanks.

Very easy to make and is unique in flavor versus traditional hummus. You will need to experiment with amount of balsamic vinegar, but that and the rosemary make it great

Meh. It was ok. The balsamic was a little overpowering both in smell and in taste, especially when eaten just on crackers. I think I will attempt it one more time and significantly reduce the vinegar. I will also try mixing it with some veggies or something to tone down the taste of the vinegar.

I was looking for a hummus recipe without tahini.  (Can't find any in my small town.) I had fresh rosemary growing and fresh garlic from the CSA so I thought this recipe looked great.  I added just a little lemon juice because I feel like it brightens the flavor.  Many wrote that they had a thin consistency, my hummus was too thick.  I kept adding oil and water.  Liked the rosemary and balsamic vinegar flavors.  I will make this one again!

Delicous recipe for hummus - I also added a little tahini instead of using that much olive oil. Made the consistency much smoother as well as a nicer flavor.

Good ... the fresh rosemary is a great addition ... I added some fresh parsley, too, as one reviewer suggested ... also, I just left the oil out completely, to cut fat/calories ... it came together great without it! Oh, and for those who like a bit of a kick: A shake of cayenne does it nicely! Thanks for the base recipe!

This was a great change to "normal" hummus!  After reading reviews I added the balsamic in a little at a time, tasting it as I went so I wouldn't over do it.  I also added feta cheese (right into the food processor.)  TRY THAT!  It's an AWESOME addition!

I'd never had nor made hummus before, but, I often use chick peas in soups and stews. This stuff is terrific. Had some last night with some pita bread and it was great. Thanks for the recipe!

This has a nice taste - I think it would make an incredible spread on a sandwich with some roasted vegis and maybe feta.   However, because it doesn't have the tahini in it, the consistency isn't that great, so I don't love it as a dip.

Sorry, no one ate this when I served it at a potluck. I liked it okay--it was quite dark because of the balsamic vinegar, so this may have turned people off trying it. I prefer my hummus less sweet.

Excellent recipe!  I was making a dish for a party.  I used a spicy hummus recipe, but for my friends who can't handle the heat, I chose this recipe.  I have never seen a hummus made without tahini- I have always thought that was a staple ingredient so I added 3 tablespoons to a doubled recipe.  Could have used more, but it was just fine without it.  The recipe isn't clear whether to use the chickpea brine or to drain it.  I separated the two and then used just enough brine to replace the oil.  Other than that I didn't mess with the ingredients at all.  I thought it had a more wholesome, homemade taste/texture than that super-light fluffy stuff you can get in the store.  I don't feel like I get my money's worth out of the store bought brands!

This hummus is delicious. I was looking for a hummus that didn't use tahini because it is so expensive. The first time I made it the texture was too thick but today I processed it for a long, long time and added more liquid than I did last time. Thanks for this great recipe!

For me this was just okay. I think I like normal hummus or red pepper feta hummus better. The balsamic is too much.

In a word, DELISH!

So easy to make!!  It was 3/4 gone before getting in the fridge to chill.

I've recently become Vegan due to cholesterol issues and the tastebuds have been a little sad of late.

I was craving something to snack on, tried this recipe and the whole family can't get enough!!  This includes the toddlers.

I'm suppose to be avoiding Olive Oil, so I cut that to maybe two tablespoons. 

You just have to try this recipe!

This was different, not bad, actually it was good. I knew it would not be like my standard hummus recipe and I did find myself missing the garlic, lemon and tahini flavors. I may try this one again with some tweaks. Thanks for sharing Hannah.

I love this recipe - primarily because I've (possibly stupidly) never thought of the rosemary/balsamic addition to hummous.  

I've also tried this with all lemon juice - it takes much more than the balsamic, and subs for the water, but our fave is lemon juice with balsamic to taste, and add water only as needed.

Thanks!

I love this hummus dip! I didn't add quite as much balsamic vinegar, but the next time I make it I will. The fresh rosemary and garlic in my food processor unlocked an amazing aroma that just kept getting better the more ingredients I added. In the end it delivered on flavor. This is now one of my favorite hummus dip recipes.

having read this and all the other recipes; I realised that I would have to find a low sodium way to make it.  I had no Tahini so I put whole sesame seeds w/olive oil and a few garbanzos in to help it mix got em pretty ground up addedthe rest of beans.lemon pepper, garlic,parsley, and (tadaaaa) Kalamata olives with a little brine.. no added salt....  just keep mixing and adding garlic infused oil..  the nutty sesameflavor and garlic with little chunks of kalamata.....and a litttle lemon juice  yummmmmm!!!

I have made this hummus multiple times, and it always tastes great.  Sometimes the texture turns out a bit funny, but I think that sometimes I undercook my chickpeas (I use dried), so that makes it a bit dryer.   Oh, just to add, you can get away without a blender if you have a masher. Great hummus!

This is a great recipe! It is very filling, so I eat it for lunch with wheat thins and it doesn't weigh me down!  I soak my own beans for 24 hours and then pressure cook them for 18 minutes which makes this super economical.  It doesn't need added salt and sometimes I don't add any oil and just add more water.

Oh, wow.  I had this in my recipe box for a long time and had almost decided not to make it.  However, I finally had some balsamic vinegar on hand, and I am SO GLAD I tried this.  I followed the recipe, only I didn't have any fresh rosemary, so I used dried.  This is crazy delicious.  I didn't think there was too much vinegar at all.  I've been eating this on toasted herb bread.

This was really good. It's a nice change from the usual. I didn't have fresh rosemary though, so I added the dried version to taste. The recipe doesn't specify which type of balsamic to use, but I used white. It was slightly sweet. Very nice!

Fresh, unique flavor and so easy to make! I used dried rosemary (1 tsp for 2 sprigs fresh) and doubled the garlic. I also used a bit less balsamic vinegar and used most of the liquid from the can of garbanzo beans rather than cold water.

I LOVED this recipe, and chose it because of the balsamic vinegar in the recipe.  I usually do not cook with rosemary, so I was going to add it in the end if it needed something.  It was great without it.  I also added a tsp of oil to make it a little lighter.  Served on ak-mak seasame crackers.  YUM!  This is my favorite hummus recipe so far!

I skipped the rosemary by accident and only used 2 tbs balsamic vinegar to a double batch, plus I used the juice from cooking the garbanzos instead of water and it was amazing. I slow cooked dried garbanzos instead of using the can that way I could control the texture and the amount of sodium a bit better. This was exactly what I was looking for thank you so much!

I think this a super easy dish to make, it really takes no time at all. I love how easy it is to experiment with and try new flavors with the basic recipe. Maybe next time a roasted red pepper, olive, or even a spicy version. Loved it!!

I have enjoyed hummus from a couple different Greek restaurants, and this recipe comes very close.  I just added more garlic to taste and some paprika.  Thank you for posting this recipe!

This hummus is wonderful and flavorful!  Not your average hummus!  I served it at dinner with my extended family, and the people that eat hummus regularly raved about it.  The people new to hummus found it a bit strange.  (Amateurs!)  The balsamic flavor was a little too strong, so I will add less to begin with next time and then add it 1 tsp at a time until it reaches the strength I want.

I have made this several times and we love it!  I use less balsamic - 1/8 c instead of 1/4 c and less water - just a bit.  It is very easy and quick to make.  I serve it with the lavosh cracker recipe from sallycooks on this site. Delicious!

This is fantastically good. I added about 6 kalamata olives and about 2 tablespoons of tahini, which added some nuttiness. Because of the balsamic (instead of lemon) t is sweeter than regular hummus. great recipe!

I really like this recipe.  Made it for my sis's birthday party.  Many compliments.  Only variations I made to recipe is doubled the garlic and I didn't need all the liquid.  Cut back whereever you want.  Have made this recipe as another reviewer suggested with 1 part garbanzos and 1 part black beans.  The black beans are slightly heathier, but for guests I would recommend sticking to the garbanzos.  Looks less muddy.

I got lots of compliments on it but it's not really my flavor for hummus. Be careful on the vinegar...taste as you add. I blended a bunch of crumbled feta - very nice addition. Rosemary adds excellent flavor!

WOW. Just wow. I love this hummus. For those who don't love balsamic vinegar as much as I do, I do recommend starting with a bit less, and increasing to taste. However, I LOVE balsamic, so I added the full amount, plus I drizzled my favorite fig balsamic on top right before serving.

I've made this a couple different times, and love it as a variant from traditional hummus. It's so completely different that I love have it when I'm a little tired of the tahini based options. I've also started using different flavored balsamics such as cinnamon or espresso, which really adds to the options of how this can easily be modified.

I made this yesterday and followed what other's have said about using just a smidge of brown sugar to balance out the acidity in the vinegar.  This is delicious!!! However, I did use dried rosemary instead of fresh because that's what I had on hand.  The rosemary flavor is very mild in this, I wonder if it would be stronger with fresh?  Still wonderful stuff though, definitely a keeper recipe!

Good texture, but the balsamic vinegar makes the hummus too sweet. Might be better with 1/2 or 1/3 as much vinegar, or none. Not sure what the vinegar really adds anyway.

Really tasty! It wasn't as good the second day though....so I'd reccommend only making enough for what you need. Fun recipe!

I made the recipe as stated but I felt the hummus was too thick (which is why I gave it 4 stars).  I added an extra 1/4 cup or so of water and got a much smoother consistency.  I love the flavor.  I use Con'Olio's 18 year balsamic vinegar and it is the most amazing thing ever.  A bit spendy but worth every penny.  http://www.conolios.com/index_files/Page438.htm

Glad I tried it. Very unique. Not something I would go back to more than once every 6 months.

Yummy, yummy!! We loved this recipe. My husband said this is the best hummus I've ever made.

It's not bad but not the more typical "hummus" flavor that I was looking for. It could also take more garlic, I'd say.

This is a great recipe. I have made it twice now and my non-hummus eating fiance really likes it. The flavors are wonderful together.

This is really delicious! It's a bit sweeter than usual hummus, so I might cut down on the basalmic next time and add tahini.  Definitely experiment with the amount of basalmic you want as you go to make sure it's not too overwhelming.

This was completely overwhelmed by the balsamic vinaigrette- to the point where we actually did not finish it, which never happens with hummus at our house. I barely tasted the rosemary.  We will not make this again.

This recipe is delicious.  I had been searching for a good recipe that didn't use tahini, as I have an allergy to sesame seeds.  This one fit the bill perfectly, and I love the flavor the balsamic gives it.  I make it often and dip my veggies in it for a nice healthy alternative!  Thanks!

I needed something quickly so whipped this up for a light dinner with some Wheat Thins. I was out of balsamic, so I used red wine vinegar instead and increased garlic and dried rosemary. It turned out AWESOME!  Can't wait to try it 2morrow after it sits for a day!

This is a great starter and can probably be changed for your preference. Be careful with the balsamic vinegar, mine had too much, but I added pepper to be more of what I was looking for. I also had no rosemary so next time I will have to get some, I am sure it makes all the difference.

Personally, this was too vinegary for me.  The only thing I liked about the vinegar was that it reduced the astonishing amount of salt I always seem to add to my regular hummus recipe.  However, taste-wise, I prefer traditional hummus...

My husband loved this and I didn't really care for it.  I think you really need to like Rosemary it was just too strong for my tastes.

A very good variation on the classic hummus.
