I don't understand how some people can change a recipe drastically and then only give the recipe 2 stars. If you're substituting "healthier" ingredients or cutting back on ingredients the turn-out will be a whole different recipe. In essence, you are then giving a low rating your new, much worse recipe than the original recipe. I followed this recipe to a "T" and the cookies turned out excellent. I even had people who claimed to never before like ginger snaps rave over these. Well done! Thanks for the great recipe. I wouldn't change a thing!

((UPDATE: I continue to make these fabulous cookies.  I've discovered that the fewer cookies on the cookie sheet the better, as they will spread out a little more and crackle even better!  Also, I recommend dipping only the tops in sugar - this way, they don't stick to the cookie sheet.))  Absolutely the best cookies I have ever made!  I was so excited to see that they had actually crackled and they looked so pretty and tasted amazing!  The recipe has oil in it so the dough may look a little different than you're used to, but I think this is what makes these cookies so wonderful.  I doubled the cinnamon and ginger, and *very* lightly greased my cookie sheets (or you can use parchment paper, because they will stick otherwise).  I baked them for 7 minutes at 350 F., and they were perfect - soft, crackled, and totally yummy!

I doubled the spices and the taste wasn't too bad. My personal opinion is that it was a tad too sweet and should go better with 1.5 times of spices. Here are the problems I encountered: The dough was too soft; I had to put it in the fridge and flour my hands when rolling the dough. The dough expands quite abit upon baking, so you will only need to roll till about the size of a walnut or smaller. The recipe's "bake till firm in center" is not really accurate as the cookies harden upon cooling. I followed the advice and got big ginger crackers. So you may want to cool the cookies after time's up to check their texture.

Oh WOW! These cookies are beyond wonderful! They smell incredible! And they are so easy to make! I had set aside 3 hours to bake this afternoon... I baked the entire batch in under 45 minutes! Another bonus: they make your house smell delicious! TIPS: Double the spices! After you make the dough, refrigerate it for about 5 - 10 mins so it's less sticky when you roll it. Make sure to leave 2 - 3 inches between cookies, these really do spread out! These cookies are lovely to look at it, great to smell, but the best part is eating them!

Great old fashioned ginger snap!  
Some hints:
* Pour the 3/4 cup of oil into a measuring cup, then add the molasses to the 1 cup line,  That way, when you pour it out, none of the molasses will stick to the measuring cup.
* Sift the dry ingredients together to mix the spices in well.
* Only sugar the top half of the cookies so they don't stick on the pan.  Yellow decorator sugar looks prettier than granular sugar.
* Don't over bake.  My slightly smaller (3 1/2/ doz yield) cookies took 10 minutes.
* I didn't have cloves and substituted allspice.  They were just as good.

I read all the reviews, and did as recommended... doubled the spices and these cookies came out great. I also only used sugar on the tops of the cookie balls, but not regular granulated sugar. Instead I used the large crystal decorator sugar that you can get in cooking stores. This made the cookies just sparkle. A couple reviewers mentioned having trouble "rolling out" these cookies. These are to be rolled into marbles, not rolled with a pin! Otherwise... fantastic recipe... a keeper! (Made 36, as noted in the recipe.)

Doubled the cinnamon, cloves and ginger, rolled them small so they came out 2 inches round when done and cooked them for 8 1/2 to 9 minutes so that I had ginger "chewies" instead of ginger snaps (my preference).   You gotta take them out of the oven before you think they are done, because they keep on cooking on the cookie sheet while you are taking them off one by one to put on the cooking rack.  I made three batches in 2 weeks (co-workers think I'm the bomb!)

I made this recipe because I didn't have any butter in the house.  They are okay, but not nearly as good as recipes that call for butter.  So if you want to avoid butter, this recipe is fine.  Otherwise, there are many better ginger snap recipes.

I made three small changes and was rewarded with the best ginger snaps I've ever tasted.  First, I used dark brown sugar.  Next, I added about 1/2 cup finely chopped crystallized ginger to the flour mixture.  Lastly, I rolled the cookies in turbinado sugar (Sugar in the Raw) which added a little more molasses flavor and extra crunch due to the larger crystals.  Baked for 10 minutes on parchment, cooled 5 minutes then transferred to a rack to cool completely.  Hubby ate four before I could get them into the cookie jar.  This will be our only ginger snap cookie recipe from now on.  Many thanks to Elaine for sharing!

I would like to give this recipe 5 stars. It was great I did change a few things as suggested like doubling cinnamon, cloves, and ginger and added about 1/4 to 2/3 cup more flour. Greased my pan and lowered the temp to 300. They turned out great. This is a keeper will be making for the holidays.

Stop right there! I know what you're thinking... "I can substitute this for that, and then take this out or add that and it will be just as good." No it won't, so cut that  out. 
If you're anything like me, you have to make a recipe your own, and that's exactly where I failed here. I recently discovered using apple sauce in lieu of oil/butter, and it worked fantastically in a recent banana bread, but not so much here. I couldn't find any definitive info about using apple sauce in cookies, but I'm here to tell you DON'T DO IT, unless you want mini cookie shaped cakes, with less flavor. I used 1/4 c sauce + 1/2 c oil, and it's just not working out. Honestly, all I wanted was a vessel on which to eat nutella, and my ginger cake concoction does the trick, but it lacks the spicy snap that makes these cookies special. 
Bottom line here...these cookies didn't get all those stars and raving reviews from cutting corners, but because they're fantastic as is. So suck it up, and follow the recipe as it's supposed to be. I promise you'll thank me for it.

These are the best ginger snaps I've ever had.  
Made these with my kids, age 4, and they had so much fun.  Very easy.  My husband doesn't like any cookie other than chocolate chip but this one passed the test with him.  The only change I made was addding another 1/2 tsp ground cloves as suggested by another reviewer.

Oh, yes! This is the best Ginger Snap recipe that I have found! I love the big cracks that form in them and the soft/crunchyness. I added orange zest but, otherwise, stuck to the recipe cooking them for 11 minutes. Another time, I might make them even smaller so that they were just a bite.maybe, at that size, they would cook for ten minutes.Also, I used fresh spices from the local health food store and saw on need to increase amounts.Also, I lined my cookie sheet with Reynolds Release - I'm a real fan of that product.

i've been making this recipe for a few years now and i've finally perfected it (hence the 4 stars...5 stars for my recipe hehe). i double the spices and triple the ginger, and add 5 cracks of black pepper to the dry ingredients for extra kick. for the wet ingredients i add an extra 2 or 3 tbsps of brown sugar, and 2 heaping tsps of ginger preserves. if i have the time or am out of ginger preserves, i grate some fresh ginger and squeeze abt 2 tsps of juice into the wet ingredients. chill the dough for abt half an hr, and bake at 350F for 8 mins. i use a small cookie scoop to measure out the dough and dip only one side of the ball in sugar. perfect cookies every time.

I made these (along with pumpkin fluff) for a Halloween Party last night...WOW!  I've never received so many compliments!  I followed the recipe to a T, with the exception of doubling the spices as we really enjoy spicy snaps!  Watch the time VERY carefully, pull them out regardless of how done they look.  I baked for 8 minutes and they worked out well (only after burning a batch after 10 minutes).  THANK YOU!!!!

I have made these as written and with some modifications and I prefer it with my modifications.  I double all the spices, but I also add a 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper and about 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne.  Seriously!  I like my gingersnaps to have a bite and adding some pepper really gives it that edge.  Otherwise, they're just a spicy cookie.

Tip:  Do not substitute anything for the oil.  Vegetable oil is what makes this cookie crisp.  Butter, apple sauce and such do not do that.

This was my 1st attempt at ginger snaps.  They were a huge hit.  Per the suggestion of other reviews, I also doubled all spices (great idea).  I used a 1 inch melon scoop & the cookies were the perfect size.  I got approx. 40 cookies from the single recipe.  Delicious!

I should have doubled the spices like everyone else, but I wanted to try the recipe EXACTLY as it was and see if it was any good.  It was just ok - the taste just didn't do it for me.  They are a nice texture, but don't have enough zip.  I will try them again with more spice because the texture is so good.  I made smaller balls (more like 3/4") because I like smaller cookies, and it gave me 4 dozen cookies.

These were just what I was looking for.  They puffed up nice, cracked along the top, and with that sugar coating, look absolutely as fantastic as they taste.  Lightly crisp outside, soft, chewy inside.  Thank you so much!  ps, thanks to the other viewers, I did double the ginger(fresh grated, such a difference) and cloves.

I followed the recipe and doubled the spices as suggested. These did not turn out at all! The taste, texture, appearance are all so disappointing. They did not crackle, are flat, the sugar is not visible on the top, are tasteless and dry! I've made perfect cakes in my oven, yet these...! I cooked for 7 min the first batch and 8 min the second batch to see if this would help the top crackle. My 2nd batch was burnt after only a minute longer.

This is the BEST ginger snap recipe I've found, it has to be very close to my grandmother's.  I was happy to find they still do well at high altitude (Denver.)  I REALLY like the spices used, so I doubled them. It was a wonderful extremely flavorful treat but not too overpowering.

Really good. I didn't put the ground cloves in, cause I don't care for the flavour, and I used unsalted butter instead of oil. I also bakes it at 350 for 8 minutes. I changed it a bit, but it was amazing!

excellent recipe, a little on the hot side at 375 degrees.  i bumped it down to 350, bake 8-9 minutes for a chewier cookie, 10 minutes for a cripsy, dunkable cookie.

These are sooo good!!  Watch them in the oven, they can burn quite easily.  These are now a requirement at Christmas in my house.

I made these today - didn't change a thing except  baked them on parchment paper for 9 minutes only.  They are true Ginger Snaps...spicy, flavorful and they SNAP when you bite into them!!  I rolled them in red, green and blue sugar sprinkles for Christmas and they look great - something different and a nice addition to all the chocolate and peppermint cookies and candy I make for the holidays.  I printed this recipe to save with my holiday ones, it's a keeper!

Love these cookies! Even my boyfriend who doesn't usually like ginger snaps ate several when these came out of the oven. Brought them to a tournament once and they disappeared very quickly; one person commented that they looked just like cookies from a bakery!  I usually bake them for 10 minutes (or slightly less) so they come out nice and soft, and stay chewy the next day (found that a longer baking time resulted in the cookies being much harder/cruncher the next day; either way, the cookies usually don't last more than 2 days before they're all eaten!) I also like a spicer cookie, so I approximately double the amount of spices as written here.

I prefer a denser, "snappier" gingersnap, and this one did not fit the bill. In the middle of the cookie, this gingersnap is too chewy, and along the edges, the texture is a bit "lacy" (=not dense- it was crispy but not crunchy, if that makes any sense). Most importantly, this was WAY TOO OILY. Gingersnaps are my favorite cookie, and with all the rave reviews...let's just say that I had high expectations, and they were FAR from met.

These cookies got rave reviews from my family and my coworkers. I added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, because I love nutmeg, but otherwise followed the recipe faithfully.

A very good recipe.  I doubled the spices as suggested by other reviewers and it still needed more to my taste.  Otherwise a great cookie.  Great texture and appearance.  The cook time was right on the money for me.  I like my ginger snaps a little "snappy".  Will definitely make this again and just add a little more ginger.  Yummy!

these are so awesome! my freinds love these very much. they are very strong and are a good cookie for gifts. remember to space them for the full 2 inches when you bake them, and roll the ball really small. rounded tsp is good i think.

The BEST Ginger Snap recipe! Did everything as it was listed except I doubled the spice amounts & for the vegetable oil...I used coconut oil. These are very LOVED in my family!!  Wonderful perfectly spiced cookies that crackle on top yet retain their chewiness (if they last).  My family requests these not just for holidays but all throughout the year too. Very, very easy to make & when they are baking, your house will smell heavenly.

Everyone loves these ginger snaps! The only changes I've made to this recipe are to add a full teaspoon of ground cloves (which I grind myself) and I end up adding more vegetable oil because it can sometimes be too crumbly to roll. I would recommend leaving it in for 10 minutes, rather than 12 or they can get to be a little on the hard side (or snappy side?).

I found them too sweet! I even cut back on the brown sugar not following the recipe using 1/5 cup instead of one cup, but still they came out very sweet! Next time  maybe I will not use sugar and just the molasses.

I've made this recipe as is 3 times now and they always come out too crunchy. After a day they're too hard. I've tried baking them for less time, but it doesn't help much. I'm still looking for a great recipe and this isn't it.

Flavor is not overly sweet. I like that this turned out as a "thicker" cookie than most. Cooked at 8 min on 350. Came out crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.

This recipe creates exactly what I want in a ginger snap. Crisp outside, chewy inside. For a bit more of a gingery experience, I add candied ginger -- cut into tiny pieces -- about a third or half a cup's worth. Yum!

I made these and doubled the spices like a lot of reviewers said but it seemed like too much. I wouldn't suggest it. Also I cooked them for the full 10 minutes and they came out soft but once cooled hardened so I Would cook them less, but I prob wont make this again

This was my first attempt at baking a ginger snap.  We tend to go for moist and chewy cookies around here like chocolate chip cookies, but one of the boys loves them, so I thought I better attempt them.  The 4 rating comes from the boys, adult boys.  I did not double the spices and they were still pretty snappy and great.  Sprinkled sugar on the top *and* on the bottom as a way to keep then snappy.  Next time will double the spices like the suggestions.

I must be doing something wrong.  I read all the great reviews, but my experience doesn't match up. The dough was unbelievably runny, and even quite gooey after refrigerating for several hours.  The amount of oil seems excessive relative to the flour, and it is oozing out of the dough and the baked cookies.

If you double the spices, roll in powdered sugar, and bake for 8 minutes you have the PERFECT ginger cookies.  I have baked a few different recipes for ginger cookies and these are the ones that get the rave reviews.  My daughter keeps asking to make more.  This is now her favorite cookie (it used to be M & M cookies).  These are so easy and quick to make (no butter to let get soft, only one kind of sugar, only one egg).  They are nice and soft after baking for 8 minutes (just let them set on the cookie sheet for a few minutes to set up).  I love these cookies!  I will make these again and again!

Although these have great presentation, I think the "Big Soft Ginger Cookies" recipe has better flavor.  They had an aftertaste, as if there was too much baking soda.  Next time I will only add 1 teaspoon.

Just made these for gift tins and now I wish I'd doubled the recipe to keep some!  So good and they look like the pic.  I doubled the spices as suggested & didn't have regular molasses so I combined blackstrap molasses & white corn syrup. I'll absolutely make them again.

After reading the comments, I too doubled the spice amounts (ginger, cloves, cinnamon), as well as added some fresh ginger, (teaspoon). I also melted 3/4c of butter instead of using veg. oil and found that this worked well for me, though I didn't get the puffy cracking shown in the photo. Mine came out relatively flat, removed from oven at 8 mins. for a crispy edge and chewy centre. This was a tasty and simple to make cookie!

These were tasty but I'm giving a 3 b/c I didn't think they tasted like Ginger cookies..more like cinnamon cookies to me.  I didn't add the cloves, I increased the cinnamon and ginger by 1.5, I used olive oil (I don't know how much this affects the taste), and I replaced the molasses with honey.  I also reduced the temperature to 325 and baked for 7 minutes (I found at 375 the bottoms were burnt.  Next time I make these I would use 1 tsp of cinammon and 1.5 - 2 tsp of ginger.  They were very good cookies but lacking in the ginger taste. I didn't have any trouble with shaping the dough and didn't have the need to refridgerate the dough.  I only dipped the top of the cookie in sugar.  They were super easy to make.

These had a great flavor, but after 10 minutes in the oven, they were hard as rocks. I checked after 8 minutes, and the tops were still quite soft, so I gave them another 2, and I wish I hadn't! I would recommend 7-8 minutes, and don't worry about taking them out too early.

These were really great.. I made them exactly as is, and I should have doubled the spices to give them some kick.  They were more sweet than spicy.  I baked them at 350 for 8 minutes, since my oven runs hot.  They came out nice and chewy.

My recipe is identical, except for mine uses 3/4 c. of margarine instead of oil.  It is a very old recipe, probably from the 1940's.  It has just the right amount of spice, and does get them crisp on the outside and chewy inside.  My husband's absolute favorite for many years!  I have used colored sugars when making them at Christmas.

These cookies are amazing!!!!!!!!  I took the advice of others and doubled the spices, but when I tasted the dough, it wasn't quite spicy enough.  I changed the spice amounts to 1 1/4 t. cloves; 2 1/2 t. cinnamon; and 4 t. ground ginger.  I didn't read the whole recipe and accidentally greased the pan, but they are still superb!!  Will definately make again!!!

I feel a bit odd rating this recipe at all, since I changed it so much, but it took so well to all my substitutions that it deserves high marks! I used only 1/3 cup sugar, and 2/3 sweetener. 1/4 cup oil, and 1/2 cup applesauce. Also egg substitute for 1 egg. I had to add 1/4 cup extra flour, and chill the dough in the freezer for an hour, but the calorie reduction was worth it! 54 calories per cookie, and the chewy outside and cakey inside was very good!

I've made this recipe several times, once with butter instead of oil.  I personally think the oil makes a softer, better cookie (not to mention less saturated fat).  I also half the amount of sugar, and for a healthier cookie, I substitute 1/2 c. wheat germ for 1/2 c. flour.  I also think sprinkling sugar on top makes a big difference.  Really homey tasting.  Rave reviews from friends.

Made this for a bake sale and was not happy with the first batch. The cookies were quite dry and didn't taste like ginger snaps at all- more like plain sugar cookies. So I did as one reviewer suggested and lowered the heat to 350 and doubled the ginger and the cinnamon and they turned out perfect.  Excellent cookies, but they lose stars because I had to change the recipe.

Very flavorful, came out crunchy on the outside, with a nice chewy Center after 9 minutes.  I added 1 tablespoon of powdered Ginger, 1/2 tsp. Allspice, 1 tsp. Cinnamon, 1/4 ground cloves, 1/2 a cup of finely chopped candied Ginger, and 1/2 a cup of Rasins...  It made 4 dozen cookies that freeze great, and we just bring out what we need... Yummy,,

Beautiful cookies. I used a cookie scoop so all my cookies are about the same size. However, in doing this, the recipe only made 18...not 36 like the recipe says. The dough grows though so what I thought were going to be small cookies turned out to be normal sized. I was very happy with the results.

This is a great recipe! I did toy around with it the second time to see if I could tell a big difference in some healthier changes.  I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil and whole wheat flour instead of all purpose. They were equally great! My husband ate the second batch faster than the first! I would definitely recommend doubling the spices.
I baked mine for 10 minutes and they did not spread too thin. They are not too soft, but still have a good crunch that won't break your teeth.
I put sugar on a few of them, but I think they are pretty enough with out the added sugar.

Very quick and easy to make. Yummy the day made but become harder next day (just the way we like them!).  Doubled the cloves, cinnamon & ginger per other users; substituted approx. 1/2 c. coconut oil then topped off with canola oil to make 2/3 c. of oil; used dark brown sugar.  Did NOT put the decorator sugar on the cookies.  Next time will try with half whole wheat flour.

This is now one of my fave cookie recipes.  Love that I can make them spur of the moment.

love the ease of this recipe and the pretty cookies.  i'm with those who doubled the spices.  i also had to make a few substitutions since i'm in germany.  i used half brown sugar and half white because the brown i'm used to from the US is hard to get here.  i also had to substitute the molasses for 'goldsirup'.  and, because i didn't have vegetable oil in the house, i used 1/4 cup olive oil (very mild) and 1/2 melted butter.  turned out great and i certainly didn't have any problems with sticking to the pan (plus yummy butter flavor)!  i also agree with the reviewer who said to put fewer cookies on the pan and bake more batches.  MY secret to this recipe is to refrigerate the dough overnight.  i did it the first time just because i didn't have time to bake several batches, but i've done it every time since because the cookies were prettier, the dough was easier to make into balls, and, the best part, the spices intensify and harmonize.  i will definitely continue to experiment with these because the base recipe is so easy and consistently good.

Fabulous is an understatement.  These are amazing cookies.  I thought I liked ginger snaps, but all I've ever eaten were grocery store cookies.  I will never eat another grocery store ginger snap.  These are crisp, tender and the sweet spicy taste is heavenly!

My coworkers proclaim this the best cookie ever.  I double the spices but other than that, I haven't changed it. Every time I make these, I have to double the recipe.  I make the cookies dime size.  I've made this recipe about 20 times since I first discovered it.  I won first prize at the county fair with these so I guess now they're award winning lol  The whole house smells like Christmas when these are baking.  They're fast, they're easy and they're really good.  I will be giving batches of these to my coworkers for Christmas gifts.

I made these cookies tonight, and after reading the reviews, I doubled the spices and refrigerated the dough for 10-15 minutes.  I also used a ice cream style cookie scoop to form the balls of dough, eliminating any mess.  I only baked them for about eight minutes to achieve a perfect, crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside cookie, but of course all ovens vary.  These cookies are perfectly delicious and so easy to make!

This is an excellent BASE recipe.  It can easily be tailored.  However, as it is, it delivers a very wet cookie dough and thus a chewy, thin, delicious texture once baked.

Here are some of my changes ( since I really LOVE spicy gingerbread cookies ):
- I amped up the spices (1.5 tsp of cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg, ground ginger )
- I added a bit of cayenne pepper to give it that bite
- I added 1 tsp of vanilla to the batter
- I baked it for a little bit longer to give it a bit of crisp ( to add to the chewiness )
- I made a "harder" batch ( more traditional snap ), so added 1/4 cup of flour so I can form it into soft balls.

Awesome, I upped the ginger to 1 1/2 tsp because the first batch tasted a bit more like cinnamon than ginger, We all agreed that the extra half tsp ginger gave it just the right amount of kick! Hubby loved them and so did our friends and coworkers.

I like my mom's recipe better.  This dough was hard to work with and not as nearly as tasty. My Mom's recipe is similar, but uses  butter (1/2c.) instead of oil.

I'm making them now and I gotta say, they are not perfect.  I read a reviewer who used honey when she didn't have molasses so I did that as well upon discovering I was out of molasses.  Maybe that's why they're flat a pennies with no crackling?  Anyway, they taste good enough so I'm not faulting the recipe.

I did not change a thing in this recipe - there is no need to, as these cookies are perfect as they are - richly spiced, crisp on the outside and slightly chewy on the inside.  One of the best cookies I've ever had, and I recommend you make this recipe as is before tweaking!

I doubled the cinnamon & ginger and only sugared the tops. Lightly sprayed the pan and baked 7 mins at 350 for small ones. Made some bigger ones (3" across) for giving friends and baked them 9 mins. They're perfectly soft and fun to bite into. Heaven!  Double the recipe, because you'll want more! :-)

I actually needed a vegan version of this recipe and was't sure how to substitute the egg at first when I didn't have applesauce.  I ended up using 1 ripe banana and t worked out great.  Glad I was able to tweak it for my vegan friends.

Best ginger snaps recipe hands down.  I was looking for a homemade ginger snaps recipe to use for the Pumpkin Ice Cream recipe I found on here (search it and you will find it--it's the one that calls for vanilla wafers but everyone suggested substituting the ginger snaps which I totally agree with).  The store bought ginger snaps I used in that recipe the first time were so hard you could have chipped a tooth, yuck!  These are perfect consistency just like sugar cookies where depending on how you cook them and how thick you make them is what you will end up with.  So it's really a personal choice if you want them big, small, crispy, or soft.  I followed user Karen_M's advice by both dipping only the tops in the white sugar and lightly greasing the cooking sheets any way despite the recipe stating not to -- Never had a problem with the cookies sticking and I've made the recipe a few times now.  I used Penzeys Spices brand for all of the spices, specifically China Cinnamon Tung Hing (which smells like Red Hot candies and gives the same slight warming effect on your tongue but it's very subtle in the spice as opposed to the candies).  Very hard to prevent the family from eating these when I make them and need them for the ice cream now!

Absolutely delicious! I like spicy, so I DOUBLED all of the spices and used grated, fresh, baby ginger, doubling that too. I used real butter instead of oil. I rolled them in walnut sized balls and cooked on parchment paper for 12 minutes, checking them after 10 minutes. After cooling, they were soft-crispy on the edges and soft in the center. I prefer a crispy cookie, but am scared of cooking them too long since some reviews said they came out hard. Perhaps this is more avoidable using butter, so before pulling the next batch out of the oven, I may cook them an extra minute. They crackled perfectly on top, just like in the picture. Using parchment paper so they didn't stick to the pan was a no-brainer since they are rolled in sugar....Yielded 40 cookies

With so many stars I was hoping for a better cookie. I made them without any modifications and found them to be bland. I ended up adding a little cinnamon glaze to the top of them, which helped a little.

Light and crispy. Perfect amount of spice & great for dipping!  I'm happy to say I kept these small as the directions say to. I did not have molasses in the house and used honey instead otherwise stuck to the recipe. Perfect!!!!!!

We *love* these cookies. I usually heap the measurement of the ginger because I like mine a little spicier, but that's all I change. The texture is exactly how I like my ginger snaps.

This was exactly the type of cookie I was looking for.  I did double the spices. The texture and taste were great! I was suppose to make them for my work's Christmas party, but me and my boys ate half of them. Oh well, they will have to settle for the other half lol. Thanks so much!

I substituted a stick of butter for the 3/4 cup oil, which I calculated as the same fat content...the cookies were great by several different taste reviewers & they still had a nice crackle appearance! Next I will try doubling the spices as I have read is a great addition.  I add a very small dash of cayenne pepper to give them an extra kick and earthy flavor..it went over quite well!

TEN stars!  I love this recipe.  Don't need to double spices unless you want to.  Baking time was dead on, and my dough was not runny or oily.  No need to set it in the fridge.  Totally great!

These are delicious! I doubled the spices as suggestest by others and they turned out beautifully. I was looking for a recipe for something to entice my sister to eat. She is battling cancer/chemo and her stomach is quite upset as a result. Needless to say she doesn't have any appetite and has stopped eating. I'm hoping the ginger will help ease some of the symptoms.

I made these cookies and doubled the salt, cloves, cinnamon, and ginger, as recommended by other reviewers.  They turned out fabulous.  My wife says these are the best ginger snaps she's ever eaten.  This is going into my real-life recipe box.  I love that there is no butter in them, only oil.  (I use extra-light olive oil.)  The only caveat which I think bears repeating is: GREASING YOUR COOKIE SHEET WITH THESE COOKIES IS NOT OPTIONAL.  I used very good non-stick sheets and these still stuck and left residue that I had to scrape off the pans.  On the second batch, I gave it a shot of non-stick spray, and it worked like a charm.

The texture was good, but these need a little more flavor.  1 1/2 what they called for on the spices, but I think other reviewers are right and it should be doubled.

Delicious!! Best ever!  - double up the spices - cook at a lower heat so you get them more chewy - only put white sugar on top, not bottom  Thanks for the great recipe!!

Very deliciously yummy cookies that look like they came from the bakery. i will definately make them again, it's so easy to use vegetable oil instead of hard shortening. One thing though- next time i will not wear my best shirt or i will wear a bib apron. When i began mixing the first ingredients i stirred it too fast and the oil splashed all over my favorite new shirt. i hope it will come out in the wash now.   Great receipe though!

I wasn't impressed with the dough.  It seemed way too soft and I thought the cookies would spread too much.  But they didn't.  When I pulled them from the oven, they were so beautiful!  Great texture and flavor (yes, I boosted the spices according to the other reviews).  I'll make this again for sure.

These were fabulous. Very addicting too! I was a little unsure of them at first (I tried one fresh from the oven) but once they cooled, they were awesome and perfectly crisp.

I followed the recipe exactly. Didn't add more spices or anything and I thought the cookies turned out excellent! The outsides were crispy and the insides were chewy--I loved it! A day later I crushed the cookies and turned them into a ginger snap crust for a pumpkin cheesecake I made. The ginger snap crust compliments the pumpkin very well!

Mmmm these are great! I followed the recipe almost exactly, just added a bit more spices for personal preference. Be careful with the baking time if you like them soft. I did them for 8-10mins at 350F. Great with vanilla ice cream!

I've never made ginger snaps, so I guess I can't really base my rating on anything... nonetheless, they turned out beautiful and delicious!! I doubled the spices as well and threw in an extra handful of flour (about a 1/4 c. maybe) because it is a very oily dough. As others suggested, I only sugared the top of the dough balls, which I rolled to be about an inch thick. My batch yielded approx. 30 cookies and I baked them at 350 for 8-9 min (in two 15 cookie batches). Thanks for the recipe!

As suggested by other reviewers, I doubled all the spices (i.e. ground ginger, clove, and cinnamon) and baked at 350F for 8 minutes. The taste was exactly how I like my ginger cookie. In terms of texture, I was hoping for something crispy but it turned out to be soft in the center, crispy on the edges, and slightly burnt at the bottom. The color was also darker than expected. All in all, I'll definitely bake these again, perhaps using light brown sugar and mild molasses.

EDIT (10/16/10): Used the same recipe but different methods and different oven. Instead of hand mixing, I used a blender to mix the wet ingredients and hand blending the dry ingredients into the wet. Also, I changed to a gas oven, and baked my cookies at 375F for 10 minutes. They turned out perfect!

I decided to make these cookies while I was cleaning mostly because I wanted to make my apartment smell like Christmas. And these gingersnaps passed the test with flying colors, and, not to mention the main purpose of cookie making, they are real tasty too. I used safflower oil, but I didn't have brown sugar so I made a concoction of 3/4 cup of regular raw sugar and 1/4 cup of grade A maple syrup. In retrospect I am not sure why this substitution seemed logical; I guess because maple syrup is brown :) I will give the recipe another whirl once I remember to purchase brown sugar. I'm not sure this is helpful. In short, I like the recipe. Regards.

This is the first time I made these and modified my recipe based on suggestions. I was out of cloves so I added 1/2 tsp ground all spice. I added 2 tsp ground cinnamon and 4 tsp ground ginger. I used full flavor molasses. 

I wanted bite sized and found that the cookies nearly doubled in size. So after setting the batter in the fridge to cool about 20 minutes, I rolled the dough into tiny balls and flattened them as I dipped the tops in the granulated sugar. I place the flattened dough (now about the size of a quarter) onto the cookie sheet and gently pressed on top. There is a tiny pocket of air left trapped underneath if you don't press down. It doesn't affect how it bakes, however. 

I baked at 350 degrees for exactly 12 minutes. They came out perfectly bite sized and once cooled, very crunchy. Just how I wanted them!! They did have a slight aftertaste that I don't normally get when eating ginger snaps. I can't tell if it's my molasses or the ground ginger. Despite that I haven't been able to stop eating them. YUM! 

I really liked these cookies and will definitely make again with some more modifications. I am trying to get a recipe that's similar to Trader Joe's triple ginger snap cookies. Next time I'm going to try fresh ginger and going to add crystallized ginger.

Super easy to make and deeelish.  I rolled mine into walnut-sized balls and baked for exactly 8 minutes.  Looks exactly like the photo and is soft and chewy in the middle but crunchy on the outside.  I like a spicier cookie and added 3 1/2 tsp of ginger (doubling just wasn't enough)!

I love these cookies and can't stop eating them. Perfect with milk They look so wonderful and taste so wonderful, I sometimes can't believe that I have just made them myself from scratch.  I follow the recipe exactly but do watch carefully at the time in the oven.  They can easily be overbaked and turn a bit too brown.  Take them out before they "firm"...they will firm up as they cool.  8-9 minutes is the maximum time for me and my oven.  A Christmas holiday staple for sure.  Thanks.

First off these cookies turn out nothing like the picture. They are flatter and not nearly as moist.
 If you like a crunchy type of cookie make these. But if you prefer to bite into a moist gingery and soft cookie, pass these by.
 Also under cook these cookies. The recipe states to bake "until center is firm" they will come out way over done. I know it is tempting to keep cooking them but don't.
 Overall- Not bad, there are a lot better out there

I've made these crispy, chewy cookies many times and always get compliments.  The dough is oily, though, so I like to chill it for an hour or two before shaping into balls.  A great "coffeehouse" cookie.

Be careful not to overcook these! I found that if you get them out of the oven at the perfect time, they're amazing, but one minute more, and they're very hard and they carry a bit of a burnt flavor.

I decided not to roll them in the sugar as my husband didn't like to crunch through the sugar.  We didn't miss it and will make them this way from now on.
Fantastic flavor...these cookies freeze well, if you are lucky to have extras laying around!

I will DEFINITELY be making these again! I made them vegan, using "egg replacer" powder (without the added liquid), doubled the spices, and halved the oil, replacing the remaining volume with water.  They still came out PERFECT! Oh, I also used only 3/4 c. NON-packed brown sugar since we don't really like sweet stuff around here. MMMMMMmmmmmM!!!!

This recipe is the best. I doubled all the spices, added a few shakes of cayenne powder(sounds strange, but I think it enhances the ginger flavor). Also , baked them for about 9 minutes. My family can't get enough of them. If I could give this more stars, I would.

despite the word "snap" in the name, I was hoping to make the cookies in the photo, which are clearly chewier.  i followed the instructions to the "T", and the cookies were burned, flat, and crisp.  Following another user's review, I lowered the temperature to 300 degrees and kept everything else the same, and they turned out MUCH better.

I didn't think that I would like these because I am not a molasses fan...boy was I wrong!  These were great tasting.  I did make a few small changes, I didn't have cloves so I substitued nutmeg, and my oven runs high, so I preheated at 325 and baked for 7 minutes...PERFECTION!

Yum, my husband buys a box of snaps at the grocer every now and then, so I decided to try baking a batch from scratch....I doubled the spices as per other reviewers,  I also chilled the dough for an hour or so before making the cookies.  I think this made the dough a lot easier to work with.  Baked at 11 mins on a dark cookie sheet.  Perfect!

great ginger snap recipe, I made these to give as gifts to relatives and they came out great! I did double the spices as stated in other reviews & it made them taste wonderful not overpowering at all. I also recommend that you bake them for only 10 minutes, I try'd the first batch at 12 mins. & they came out just a tad bit burnt so I finished baking the cookies for only 10 minutes. Thank You so much for this yummy recipe!

Very, very easy!  Definitely have to double the spice, and I used dark molasses.  White sugar just on 1/2 the ball, for the cookie top.  Made just over 40 smaller cookies.  Baked more like 8-10 minutes in the oven, until they had crackles on top but were still soft inside.  Kept in a ziploc bag, they were still a nice tender spicy cookie three days later.

Wow.  I don't usually like gingersnaps but these were seriously wonderful.  Slightly crispy outside, nice soft inside.  
TIP:after rolling into balls, DO NOT FLATTEN.  They will flatten into perfect little circles all on their own.
I doubled the cinnamon and cloves.  Also, I only rolled the tops of the balls in sugar.  Baked for 8 minutes, until perfect!

I usually don't like ginger snaps because they are too hard, but these guys are really yummy.  I don't even bother to set the timer, I just check them periodically and once they begin to crack on top, I take them out.  They will still be very soft and gooey on the inside at this point, but just let them cool on the cookie sheet for about 5 minutes, then move them to the cooling rack.  You will think they have not been cooked long enough, but they will harden and flatten out as they cool, so they have to be super-gooey to begin with if you want them to end up chewy once they've cooled.  I have made this recipe over and over, and it has earned a place in my personal cookbook!

Even with the doubled spices I didn't think these had enough flavor.  The texture was great though, so I think I might make again with even more ginger and maybe substitue a frosting of some sort versus the rolled sugar.  I also only got 27 cookies out of the recipe (vs. 36 listed) and I thought they were pretty small.

To make a healthier cookie I...used brown sugar substitute (zero calories), 1/2 c. oil and 1 T flax seed (gives you "healthy" fat!), 1/4 c. egg beaters (30 calories) and I rolled my cookies in Splenda rather than regular sugar.  (~76cal a cookie)

FANTASTIC !!! Just finished making these cookies with my nieces.  Instead of rolling into balls I used a cookie scooper, made it much easier. Then used the bottom of a glass dipped in sugar to press cookies down slightly.  Also, I took the advise of others and doubled the spices. These came out fabulously. The tops even crackled like true ginger snaps do.  I will be adding this to my collection of cookie recipes. Thank you so much Elaine !!!

These are going to be "heirloom cookies" for me! Thank you so much for sharing it! So delicious and easy. I took some out early for softer, chewier cookies, and left some in longer for crisper cookies. I make these with the maple syrup apple cider recipe ( search allrecipes for "Hot Apple Cider") for a fall treat.

These cookies were delicious!  The one complaint was that I doubled the spices and my husband thought they were a bit too gingery.  Be sure to keep them in a well-sealed container, as they do harden up quickly!  Enjoy!

My cookies did not rise as high as the cookies in the photograph.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  Quite easy and very tasty.  My husband usually buys ginger cookies at the Amish stand at the farmer's market but feel no need to do that any more.  I would give it a 9 out of 10 and will definitely make them again.

If you are looking for a traditional ginger snap then this is your cookie. I made the recipe as written but subbing gluten free flour. My teaspoons of spices may have been heaping though ;) I used my smallest scoop to the portion the cookies and they spread a lot so allow room for spreading. The end cookie was thin but nice and chewy.

Amazing cookies. Do NOT change a thing when you make these. YOU HAVE TO MAKE THESE! Those who change the recipe and then complain.... well you didn't follow the recipe right? Don't complain! lol!

I doubled the ginger, cinnamon and cloves per reviews and these came out great.  They seemed very oily when I was putting them on the cookie sheet but they came out perfect so don't be alarmed by this.

I make a lot of cookies, and these were really easy and turned out great. I doubled the spices per other reviewers and I might add even more ginger & clove next time (I like it spicy). I found that the cookies on the top rack in the oven cracked beautifully, those on the lower rack didn't really. I also rolled some into 2" balls and some into marble-sized, and the marble-sized turned out so cute and bite-sized that I'll do them all that way next time. They do spread out quite a bit so space accordingly! Rolled some in red and some in green sugar and they looked great for Christmas. Baked for exactly 9 minutes and they were perfect (just a tiny bit chewy still). I plan to make these many more times.

I made these cookies the other day to surprise my husband since he loves ginger snaps.It was a big hit with him and the children. I followed the recipe except I added an extra 1 tsp of ginger and 1 tsp of cloves. I was able to get almost 4 dozens cookies from this recipe. The cookies were ALL gone less than an hour. Guess what? I am in the kitchen making more!!!!

This is an awesome cookie recipe! Ovens vary. Mine is electric and it worked best with temperature at 350 for 8 minutes. They are beautiful. Crisp on the outside chewy in the center. I really can't express with words how delicious and pleasing these cookies are. You must try them! Thanks for sharing.

Made these today.  Very easy and came out well.  I did double the spices as some other reviewers suggested, and baked them on parchment paper.  I scooped mine out using a half tablespoon measuring spoon, putting the little domes on the sheet and they came out perfect.  Watch them carefully though and take them out when they flatten, NOT when they are firm in the middle. Unless you want *really* crunchy cookies.  When baked for just 10 minutes on the dot they hardened up a bit on the outside to be crisp and were a tad chewy in the middle and were just perfect.  Watch them carefully, they do burn easily.

Easy recipe to follow and mix up. It makes 5 dozen cookies rolling dough in about 1" rolls - Just enough for about 3 bites! House smells like Christmas - a keeper. DOES ANYONE OUT THERE KNOW ABOUT ADDING BLACK GROUND PEPPER TO GINGER SNAPS? Had a recipe years ago for that and can't find it.

These are the best ever! So soft and chewy!  I have made this recipe about 10 times now.  I am asked to bring these to our holiday gatherings a few times each year. I make it exactly how is is written with the exception of using olive oil because that is what we always have in the house.  I have also made gluten free version with great success.  I make them small, about 2 inches in diameter.  They are soft and chewy and slightly thick in the center if the dough is refrigerated slightly before rolling.  If the dough sits out too long they can come out a little flat.  These freeze well but nothing beats a fresh one!

This recipe is pretty easy. The cookies came out well and my kids really liked them. They're not super crunchy or thick, but that might have to do with the climate of the area, always humid. My one gripe is that I doubled the amount of spices, per other reviewers, but I really didn't think they had that nice ginger snap spicy taste. I wanted to make this as a more grown up cookie recipe, but it seemed like a milder version, one that kids will really like. I did substitute Karo's dark corn syrup because I didn't have molasses, so I'm not sure if that would really affect the recipe. Anyway, if making this recipe, make sure to bake for only 8 minutes if at 375 degrees, otherwise instead of crunchy, you get a slightly burnt taste on the bottom of your cookie.

I just made this recipe. The only thing I changed was just putting sugar on top of the cookies so the "sweet" wasn't overpowering. I made these cookies for a class which is why I didn't go for a "spicy" cookie. Instead I left the amount of spices as is. But, if you like that holiday spice then double the spices to double your pleasure! As is, the recipes is AMAZING and my family loved it!

I love these ginger snaps. They are soft in the middle and crisp on the outside. The flavor is very much what I expect from a ginger snap and they are easy to make!  I like that this recipe uses NO BUTTER and can very easily be converted to a vegan recipe..

I have made these twice in one week. My family loved them so much they decided that this is our newest go to for Christmas cookies. I also made them for our church family that came back to me for seconds. GOOD GOOD GOOD
Oh and a tip I tried and worked very well was spraying my hands with a little cooking spray so the dough didn't stick to me. Hope that helps and Happy baking!

Best Ginger Snaps I've ever eaten!  I always read a bunch of reviews before making a recipe and found the most common tip was to double the spices, so that's exactly what I did... these cookies are all about the spice, so I figured I couldn't go wrong there.  These cookies are so delicious I've had to force myself to stop eating them!!  I made the cookies smaller than the recipe called for so when I baked them 10 minutes, I think that was a tad long because they really hardened up.  Next time I will bake them 6-8 minutes and then let them cool a bit on the cookie sheet.  I also had no problem handling the dough - it was a little soft, but definitely workable to roll into a ball... the only thing I noticed is that when I rolled the tops in sugar, the sugar clumped a little - maybe because the dough was a little warmer and soft?  I'm sure a little bit of time in the fridge would fix that.  Just little tips for next time I make these, because there WILL be a next time!

I accidentaly preheated the oven to 350 instead of 375. The cookies were soft in the middle, just the way I like them. I will make these again and again, thanks for sharing!

Too Good to be true! After unsuccessful purchase after purchase of 'tripe ginger' 'organic ginger snaps' and the list goes on... This is the best hands down! I think this should satisfy any Ginger Snap Critic! I should know ;)

Amazing though I did take the advice of others & amped up the spices to 1 1/2 tsp for all.

Absolutely perfect.  The only thing wrong with this recipe is that it doesn't make enough cookies.  Double this one for sure, because they disappear far to quickly.

All I could taste was the oil.  Substitute butter, and I bet it will taste ten times better.

I had read the reviews earlier and decided to make this recipe for my family's Christmas cookies.  I followed the recipe to the letter, except that I doubled the spices, as suggested by several reviewers.  They came out perfect!  They are delicious and crisp and crackled perfectly on the outside. They are crisp on the outsdide and yet chewy on the inside.  They have a really delicious, "buttery" taste.  These are really wonderful and are now my new go-to recipe.  I highly recommend this recipe.

These were perfect! I followed the recipe exactly (I always do on my first attempt). I baked them for 11 mins and had a nice firm, not hard, outer 'shell' and they were a nice soft, but not mushy, interior. I didn't do the icing just b/c I wasn't in the mood. I rolled them in sugar and baked them on a Silpat and had no problem with sticking. The sugar makes a nice subtle decoration on their own. And I love the way these 'crackle' - beautiful :) Delish and fragrant! Will definitely do again.

I made these cookies for Christmas last year, they were fantastic, CRISPY, CRUNCHY, gingery goodness!  These cookies are a true snap.  I got many compliments on the cookies that made it to the gift trays.... cookie gremlins in my kitchen.  The only thing I changed was pressing them with a cinnamon sugar coated flat bottom glass.  They spread into a wonderfully large cookie, and looked so beautiful.

These are the best ginger cookies I've made. I think the secret is the oil; the other recipes I have use shortening or butter. Even though the dough is soft, it doesn't stick to your fingers when you're rolling the balls. I took other reviewers' advice and doubled the spices. I used parchment-lined cookie sheets, made the cookies a little smaller than directed and baked for 8-9 minutes. My best results were with an insulated cookie sheet. The best part is that these take so little time to make! Everyone has raved over them and asked for the recipe.

Yum!! These are fantastic. I substituted allspice for the cloves and doubled the spices. I followed what some others suggested and made the dough balls about walnut sized, then baked for 14 minutes and cooled on the baking sheet for a perfect dunking ginger snap! Great recipe, thank you!!

Doubling the spices and substituting butter for oil makes these much tastier. Wish I had *MY* mother's recipe; I've never been able to figure out what extra something made them so delectable.

Made these for a special friend who LOVES ginger snaps.  He is suffering from lung cancer and I felt it would be a neat way to express my feelings since I just don't have words. Now I have to hurry and deliver them before my husband and I eat them all. Delicious AND easy to make. Stuck to the recipe and will make them again without any changes. Thanks!

These turned out quite good. Soft and chewy. Mine never cracked like the picture, but it may have been because I halved the recipe, so small changes did occur. I also doubled the spices, and they were in no way too much. Not super spectacular, but over all very tasty :)

I just pulled these out of the oven and they're definitely great cookies.  I increased the spices by 50% and rolled the tops of the cookies in raw sugar.  This recipe has the added plus of being lactose free!

I wasn't sure how to rate these -- I halved the recipe, and it didn't seem to work out.  The cookies were more soft & "cakey" instead of snappy, or crunchy or crispy. I believe the amount of flour would need to be further reduced if I were going to half it again.

These are delicious, and get better with age.  I actually am going to try other ginger snap recipes before I try this one again.  I want to try some that are more spicy or snappy, I guess.

Yum! We used olive oil because it was all we had around... I would actually decrease the cooking time if you're not a fan of crunchy cookies, but we love them both ways!  Next time we're going to try 8 minutes and see how they come out.

Excellent recipe. I rolled them smaller (3/4") and baked for about 8 mins for smaller and softer cookies.

I have never liked Ginger Snap cookies so I have never made them before therefore I can't attest to how this recipe process compares to others.  Then my three Step children requested I make Ginger Snaps this year I was hesitate.   The kids LOVED them...better than they are use to from previous years.  I tried them and loved them too. It didn't need any twinking on my part. Thank you for posting.

These cookies are the best!  Because we tend to like spicier tastes, I did add a tsp of ground cloves. This recipe is a keeper.  Thanks, Elaine

These are the BEST Ginger Snaps EVER.  The first time I made them, I doubled all of the spices, and I am glad I did. I cooked them in a low temp oven-about 325-until small cracks started to form on top of the cookie.  I took them right out of the oven and immediately put them on a cooling rack.   These cookies are spicy, soft and delicious!

I started in 2005 making this cookie for Christmas and it has become our traditional ginger cookie.  I double the recipe but don't make any changes.  It is a great cookie and looks so professional, as well as tastes very good.  Thanks Elaine for sharing it.

I tried this recipe as is the other day and it was amazing! I made them again today and decided to double the spices (I like my snaps on the spicy side) and they turned out wonderful then too. Delicious cookies, thanks for sharing!

These were terrific!! My first time making them, i've only had the ones from the store. I like them to have more of a 'ginger-y bite' to them so I will add more next time. The texture was chewy in the middle and crunchy on the outside, I loved that!! In all a fabulous recipe to me! Me, my kids and family gobbled them up for Thanksgiving. Thanks for this recipe :))

very good gingersnaps..taste different than ones baked with butter of course I used a couple of tablespoons less oil and otherwise followed the recipe to a tee. Just bake them for 8 mins and they will be perfect slightly chewy on the inside!

I just made this recipe earlier today and it was delicious though the bottom of the cookies were oily. I recommend cutting down some on the vegetable oil a bit but other than that they were amazing.

OMG! These are just delicious. Made them for the Christmas trays. I had to put them in the freezer as soon as they were cool so that I would not eat everyone of them myself! I doubled the spices as someone else had suggested and they couldn't be better. Thank you for sharing Elaine.

i decided to look for a ginger snap recipe so i wouldn't have to buy them at trader joe's :) this was my first try and i will definitely keep making them. i did double the spices, per other reviewers advice. they had a great flavor and i loved the crispness, that is what i think of in a ginger snap. i rolled them really small and rolled the tops in organic sugar. i got 50 good sized cookies out of it. a keeper for sure!

I made this recipe exactly the way stated here for a babyshower.  I also made the ginersnap dip.  It was a big hit.  There was a guest there that was saying how much they don't like gingersnaps, but then he tried it and he couldn't quit eating them.  He even took some home in a doggy bag.  If this recipe converts him, you should give it a try.  He said he liked it because the ginger taste wasn't strong, more of a mild taste.

By far the best Ginger Snap cookies I have ever made or tasted! I doubled the spices (as other reviewers suggested) and they turned out perfect. My husband loves them too. I will be making these throughout the holiday season. YUM!

I'm not sure what I did wrong, I followed the directions exactly, except that I undercooked them. They still managed to be burned even though I cooked them less than the time stated, and they were incredibly oil-y even after they had baked.

Edit 11/6: I rate these with two stars if they're made as stated. After adding 3/4 to 1 cup of flour, vanilla, and extra spices, they were very good. Otherwise they are incredibly oily.

these are lovely!  i used Splenda Brown Sugar, canola oil, and EggBeaters, and substituted 1 cup of the allpurpose flour for a cup of whole wheat flour---they came out great!!  however, i wouldn't call these "ginger snaps";  they are more a cross between gingerbread and a molasses cookie to me...not complaining, mind you---they are great!!  thank you!!

So, so yummy. After making the first 12 of them, I did put in an extra 1/4-1/2 cup of flour because they were a little too thin for my preference. I also slightly increased the spices. The taste is amazing....perfect for fall!!

I presently live in a country where I have never seen any Ginger snaps and I had a hankering. I know ginger snaps and I must say, as Ginger Snaps go, this recipe is right on the money! I did everything just as said (no doubling of anything) and I thought it was just perfect!

I made four different kinds of ginger cookies all in the same day to find the best.  These won hands down.  I doubled the spices, I was able to form the dough into balls immediately with my cookie scoop, and they came out looking and tasting like professionally-made cookies!  Several people tried all four kinds and every person voted for this recipe as the best!

Pretty good. Look store bought, but the taste is far from processed. I would use no cloves next time, I didn't care for the scent or the taste of cloves in the cookies. The recipe is very easy. I use a small mellon baller to pull off pieces of dough and pressed them with the bottom of a sugar coated measuring glass. They look beautiful. I didn't give the recipe five stars because something is "off". Can't put my finger on it. Maybe the lack of flavor from the fat? the oil just does nothing for this cookie.

YUM!!  Absolutely the best......didn't change a thing, except I found I like them better not rolled in sugar when I forgot to roll one of the batches.  Crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, with the yummy molasses ginger bite.

Made Mom's Ginger Snaps cookies as written in recipe. No changes! When eatting a cookie it left an oilness in the mouth which I did not like. Surprised with all the reviews and only one other person mentioned this.

Do not change anything about this recipe! The spice amounts are perfect and my cookies came out crisp on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. I only dipped the tops in sugar as suggested by another review and I baked them 10 minutes exactly. Great recipe! I will make these again and again.

I LOVE this recipe. I double the spices and use fresh ginger instead of ground. As well, I refrigerate the dough for anywhere from an hour to a few days before baking....so yummy!

These were FABULOUS! Crackled beautifully, crispy outside, and soft inside. The only thing I changed was instead of 3/4 cup vegetable oil, I used 3/4 cup melted unsalted butter. My husband is one tough cookie (pun intended) to please and he loved them.

I am updating my rating from 4 stars to 5 stars.  I stored these overnight in an airtight container.  I had one for breakfast and they are fabulous!  Soft, chewy and very spicy!  I think these are right up there with my favorite Big, Soft Ginger Cookies from this site:)  I will definitely be making these again!

I made this recipe exactly the way it's written. I would add more ginger next time. I also made mine 24 larger cookie instead of the suggested 36. I just wish these were softer and chewier otherwise, great cookie. I'll try it again.

the first time I made these, they burned on the bottom. The second time they came out much better. I find they don't need quite 10 minutes. I like them a bit more spicy, so I put more ginger in the 2nd time. This is a great recipe!

I gave it 4 stars only because it needs moer of a spicy flavor. I also chopped some ginger root in it for more of a ginger zest. Came out pretty good.

I really loved these cookies! The recipe "as is" makes a mild, softer cookie.  I substituted almond oil for vegetable oil - a slightly healthier alternative. Also, a better indicator for "doneness" is if the edge of the cookie is dry.

I would rate this as a GOOD BASIC recipe...however, I HAD to modify it to my tastes.  I like my ginger snaps, strong and crispy / hard.  So, basically, with this recipe, there were a few things that were slightly faulty  1)  It DEFINITELY needs more flour, in order to make it into that " play dough " consistency, in order to shape it into round, hard cookies.    2)  It DEFINITELY needed more spices.  I added a bit of cardamom and some fresh ground ginger.  I also added 1 tsp of sweet brandy.  I found that I had to add HALF ( medium to large root ) in the entire cookie, just to give it a bit of a " kick ".      3)  I also added a bit more molasses bc I wanted it to be dark and flavourful.    In the end, it turned out into that wonderful, old-fashioned, snappy, hard, ginger cookies that have serious bite.

Will use more flour next time but they came out tasting great.  Really flat due to altitude/need of flour.  Will make again!  TIP:  Rolled ball in sugar, reshaped in hands, then dipped top back in sugar.  Perfect cracking.  Reshaping helped stick the sugar to the dough.

I have been making these cookies for a couple years now. I love the crunchiness of them. One modification that I made is I double the recipe and add about 2-3 tbsps of fresh grated ginger to the wet mixture. It gives it a little more genuine ginger flavour. Also, the batter is easier to roll if it is a bit cool.

Excellent ginger flavor.  My wife does not like wheat, so I substituted one cup of Quinoa and one cup of Soy flour.  I also reduced the brown sugar to half cup and doubled the spices plus a teaspoon of ground cardamom.  10 minutes at 350 did the trick.

Every one loved these!!!  They were a bit spicy, but not over spicy - I added some nutmeg as well and that added a nice bite to it.  They were soft in the middle which was perfect - great as a dunker in spicy Chai tea!!!

These are good cookies. I gave them only 4 stars since I ended up following another reviewers recommendation,...Bake at 350 for 8 min. and double the spices like several others suggested.
My first batch I baked at the recommended temp for 9 min. As they cooled they started to get harder than what they should be. 
My second batch is when I reduced my oven temp to 350 and baked for 8 min. Much, much better. As they cooled, they did not get hard in the center.

These ginger snaps turned out wonderful and delicious! I doubled the spices per other suggestions and added 1tsp of almond extract to the molasses mixture. I only had about 1/4tsp of ground cloves, so I substituted nutmeg for the rest. 

The second time I made these, I added 1/2 cup of quick oats and about 2-3 tablespoons of flax seed. I also substituted one cup of whole wheat flour the white flour.
These were yummy and fast! I'll be adding this to my recipe rotation.

LOVE THESE!  I also doubled the cinnamon, cloves & ginger as other suggested.  Used my medium Pampered Chef scoop and baked for 8 minutes (on parchment paper).  Let them cool just a bit before moving to a cooling rack.  These will be part of our holiday cookies for sure!  Thanks!

This recipe is great as-is. I really like that it calls for vegetable oil instead of butter. I think that this makes the cookie crisper, but that's ok - they're good that way with tea.
I've never used dried ginger so I used fresh here - about a tablespoon. I also doubled the other spices, which I think others have done as well. Great recipe.

Love them! These might be favorite cookies. I love fall spice smells. Turbinado sugar is good for rolling them, rather than regular white sugar. Don't overbake these. I prefer them a little chewy rather than crispy. But they will get very crispy if you overbake.

Wonderful, brings back memories of my time with my Grandmother.  Only change is to almost double the dry spices. Adds a little more "zing!"

These were so nice and chewy when warm, but hardened when cooled.  Great taste.  I used 1 3/4 cup whole wheat flour instead of the all purpose and they turned out perfect.

What a great recipe! I used white sugar instead of the brown, and added just a tablespoon more molasses to compensate. I was out of cloves, too, so I just used a 1/2 teaspoon more Cinnamon. They turned out delicious with beautiful crackly lines!

These cookies are great and freeze really well. I doubled the spices and added 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper to make them even spicier. Watch them really closely while baking - I found 8 minutes at 300F was perfect with my oven. Once they begin to crackle they're pretty much done.

We started making these cookies last year around Christmas time and my oldest son (who is 4) has kept me making them all year long.  They do not last long at our house.  One thing that I do is roll them in powdered sugar.  I think they look better and I love the extra little bit of sweet!  All around these cookies are the best I've ever made!  Thanks for giving me a recipe that I can actually make!

After reading several of the reviews, I decided to go ahead and try this recipe. I found that the end product appeared just as the photo illustrates. Do double the spices as suggested by several subscribers. Planning on making more for holiday cookie plates. They are absolutely delicious and make the whole house smell devine as they bake.

Perfect. I doubled the amount of cinnamon, ginger, and cloves as previous users suggested and added a pinch of allspice for my personal tastes. I baked for around 10 minutes and the bottoms were a dark brown but the cookie was still soft and the bottoms were chewy. If you want a more evenly soft cookie definitely take them out of the oven at 8 or 9 minutes. I will be making these again for sure! Next time I'm going to also try it with dark brown sugar for a richer taste and a even denser, chewier cookie.

These cookies are  wonderful.  My First batch didn't snap so I had to bake them a tad bit longer for the crunchy goodness to shine through.  They were wonderful!

These are good however it lacked a little in taste. I even doubled the Cinnamon and Ginger. Next time I will add even more spices and some fresh Ginger to give it that zing. I baked for exactly 8 minutes and it was perfect consistency. Looked really pretty with the sugar and crack on top.

I love these cookies! I followed the recipe exactly as written and they turned out perfect each time. I used "Brer Rabbit" unsulphered molasses which I liked better than "Grandma's" brand. To dress them up a bit, I dipped half of the cookie in white chocolate...it gave them a super creamy flavor and special presentation!

I had to make cookies at the last minute for a meeting and I had no butter.  These were great (and fast).  They seemed oily making them but they turned out okay.

While these were very easy to make and I liked their chewy texture, I found them just OK. To make them softer, I added a little more flour (2 tsp) as others have suggested, but I thought the end result was a bit too flour-y and bland. My boyfriend said they were better after two days or so, so perhaps it just takes some time to get the flavors to blend together. In the future, I will try making them without the extra flour. I'll also increase the amount of spices I put in, and hopefully, that'll do the trick. I did also try the "Big Soft Ginger Cookies" recipe on this site and I thought it was great. I much preferred the flavor of those cookies to these.

These taste the same as my mom's recipe, but I like these evem better than hers. They're nice and soft! One variation I sometimes add, which I learned from my mom, is to put half of a large marshmallow on top of each cookie as soon as they are removed from the oven. It adds a little different taste and texture. Thanks so much for sharing a great recipe!

I cooked the first batch for 10 mins, and they were hard and burnt, so the next batch went in for 7 minutes.  They turned out hard but only a little less burnt.  Also they certainly didn't taste like my Grandma's gingersnaps, they were way too bland for my tastes.

I've made these twice in the last week, and everybody has loved them. I've left out the cloves, and used 1 1/2 times the ginger and cinnamon. I'm wondering how the recipe would be if I cut the oil somewhat. They are wonderful, but too oily.

I'm giving this recipe 4 stars because of how the finished product turned out! The dough however left something to be desired. It was very very oily and not pleasant to work with. I'm wondering if anyone else had this problem? I doubled the recipe and was very careful about making sure I doubled everything, so I'm not sure where or if I went wrong. Oh and I made one substitution. Instead of molasses I used honey. It gives the cookies a lighter flavor!!!

These are the best cookies I have ever made! My whole family loved them! They are really chewy! I baked them at 300 degrees and add 1.5 of the spice. If you wrap the dough in plastic wrap and put in the fridge for 30 minutes they are really easy to shape, and I think that it brings out the flavour! YUMMMM!!

These were quite a hit around the house. They're very similar to the "crinkle top cookies" that won the Good Morning America cookie contest a couple of years ago.

These are so good and easy to make.  It's crispy on the outside and gingerbread-like  on the inside.  Rolling the dough in sugar gives it a nice glittery and crispy surface.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Be careful not to overbake ... 10 minutes is sufficient.

Very nice! I also cooked them for about 8-9 min. My oven runs hotter. I made recipe as is and is very tasty. Mildy spicy. If you are looking for an extra kick I would use 1 1/2 times the amount or possibly double. I liked these the way the recipe states but next time I would increase the ground cloves slightly.

These cookies are wonderful! I followed recipe exactly and came out perfect. I made a batch to freeze for a party and left a few out for my husband and by the next afternoon he was asking me to make more. I find cooking for 10min is best. 12 minutes makes them very hard and "snappy", but I prefer a bit of chewiness. I also refrigerated the dough for a few minutes before dropping onto cookie sheet.

I'm not usually a fan of ginger snaps but I love these!  Hubby is even getting hooked. Softer than the store bought ones I have had.  I baked these for 8 minutes on parchment paper and they were perfect.  When I baked them for 10 min I thought the bottom tasted almost burnt.(I think my oven runs a little hot)

I also doubled the spices, and the first batch I undercooked a little. Mine took 11 minutes to cook, and made exactly 36 cookies. This makes a crisp cookie, and they were very enjoyable. The only thing I suggest is puting the dough in the fridge before attempting to roll the balls.

I refrigerated my dough before making balls.  My cookies did not look like the picture.  Mine spread more and made a very thin cookie crisp.  Smells and tastes good though.

I just want to put my two cents in about these cookies.  I followed other reviewers suggestions and increased the spices. I did not quite double the ginger, cinnamon, and cloves.  They are delicious, but next time I will try the recipe as is.  The flavor is really very strong; I guess I like my ginger snaps more on the mild side.  They are delicious, nice and chewy.  5 stars either way!

These cookies are soooo good! If you love the smell of cloves and ginger you'll make the house smell like a real holiday. Everyone will want more than seconds, so double the recipe! This to me is the perfect Ginger Snap.

wow, what a delicious ginger snap! crispy outside with a slightly chewy center. i followed this recipe as written with the exception of rounding off my spices. like other reviewers, i refridgerated my dough for about 15 minutes so it was easy to roll in to a ball. don't worry, the dough will flatten out into normal sized cookies (i got 3 1/2 dozen). my baking time was exactly 12 minutes. after cooling, i packed them airtight with a paper towel in ziploc bags. these cookies taste great the same day but get even better with age. many thanks for your mom's fabulous recipe, elaine!

these were good. The dough was pretty goopy I was worried but they shaped just fine...I used the large end of my melon baller and it was the perfect size. The flavor is subtle I actually like my gingersnaps with a bit more bite. I know everyones oven is different but for me 11 1/2 minutes was burnt and 10 minutes not quite enough. It was kind of hard to tell because these are the kind of cookies that harden as they cool. I think I'll keep looking.

Great cookies Elaine! I made them exactly as written, except I only baked them for 8 minutes. They turned out beautifully. I already have a very spicy Ginger Cookie recipe. I like these because of their more mellow taste. These are a keeper for sure.

THANK YOU MOM!

I love the flavor of gingersnaps but can't stand the toughness of most cookies.  I'm a soft-cookie person and this recipe met that need.

I like things really spicy too so I doubled the spices like someone before had suggested and these came out fabulous.  I wouldn't change anything else.

I served these with Pumpkin Dip (also found on this site) and it was great.  These cookies are a new staple to my recipe box.

I got this very same recipe from my mom, well, very close to the same. We use a full teaspoon of cloves, not half. Also, We use 3/4 cup shortening instead of vegetable oil. Cream shortening and brown sugar together, add remaining wet ingredients, then slowly add dry. I add the flower last as depending on how you measure it, you can end up with too much, then the dough is too dry and won't form into proper balls. Our recipe calls for 2 1/4 cups flour. I tried to reduce to 2 cups because once it was way too much flour, I had to cream in a couple extra tbsp of shortning so the dough would form balls. But 2 cups wasn't quite enough. If its too wet add flour, too dry add more shortning. Also, and this is important: It says in this recipe to roll the balls in white sugar. If you do that the sugar on the bottom of the ball will burn. Only dip the TOPS in the sugar. And you'll only need a couple tablespoons of sugar. Just put a bit of sugar in a bowl, otherwise you end up with leftovers that have to go in the garbage because it has dough crumbs in it! Also the cookie sheet needs to be greased, I rub some shortening on a paper towel and spread that around the sheet. And I bake for 10 mins, no more, and store in a rubbermaid container with a slice of bread to keep them soft.
I absolutely love these cookies, they are my favorite!

These cookies are delicious, especially right out of the oven.  Make sure the spices you use are fresh; I made the mistake of reaching to the back of the cupboard on one batch and they didn't turn out nearly as good.  Also, bake them just until the tops start to crack, otherwise they will get a little bit crispy.  Great recipe.

We make cookies several times a week for snacks and lunchboxes. This recipe is the one we use most. We substitue whole wheat pastry flour for the all-purpose flour, just so Mom can feel like the kids are getting something with at least a little substance! These cookies taste fabulous, look gorgeous, contain no wicked solid fats, and are easy to make. We love them. Yay for Elaine!

I found this recipe today, 12/7/2002, and I made the ginger snaps right before my husband went to work.  This is an easy recipe and the ginger snaps turned out wonderful.  My husband took half of them to work to share with his crew.  This is by far the best ginger snap recipe I have ever tried!!!

We live at high altitude (6500 feet) so I never know if a recipe will turn out well when I follow the instructions.    This recipe works great as is.  As suggested by several reviewers, I did double all the spices except  the salt and both hubby and I are big fans of the result.  I baked them for 12 minutes, although I must have made them a bit too big because I got 27 cookies.  If you are a high altitude baker,  you probably know that you need to give any ball-shaped cookies a little smush before baking to help them spread properly.

I like this recipe a lot. It’s easy to whip up. I follow the recipe to a T. I made the mistake with my first batch of leaving them in too long. They are still soft when they come off the pan and will harden as they cool.

Made them and they were absolutely delicious, I took them out at 11 minutes and they turned out perfect, I accidentally let the next batch a bit longer and then they were too hard. So 11 minutes were perfect. Sooo good!

Made it with my 3yo and 6yo grandchildren.  They enjoyed making "cookies for Santa" and the activity provided a great memory for them.  Depending on the size of the cookies, you need to make certain you don't over-cook.  Smaller cookies cooked 9 minutes in my oven and 10 minutes was the longest that I needed to cook.  Don't expect chewy cookies--these are ginger "snaps" after all.  Very tasty and just the right snap.

This recipe is fantastic! If you follow it exactly the same, you are going to get fail proof cookies. I recommend to not change anything. I’ve made these cookies multiple times for potlucks and every time I get asked for the recipe!! So delicious!!

I made these exactly  and found that the recipe isn't "gingery" enough for us. I did like the texture of the cookie but next time I make them, I'll add quite a bit more ginger to  the  recipe

These were okay, I will make them again just to see if it's my fault... I changed the oil to coconut... and spices to 1.5, I will double them next time... also the scoop I used gave me 60 cookies, but they didn't spread much... so ended up cooking them for 15 minutes, they were so soft in the middle... Now they have hardened up., so don't cook them longer than you should.... The flavour is mild.. I want them for a cheesecake base so they will be fine.. I'll update once I make them again... I don't like veg oil though so won't use it.

I made this recipe exactly as written, and they came out perfectly. I like spicy food, but I did not think that the spice level needed boosting. I like the oil, which makes the dough easier to mix than butter, and it works for my dairy - intolerant friends. I used parchment paper, and had no trouble with sticking. I baked mine for 12 minutes, based on the instruction that the center be firm. When I checked at 10 and 11 minutes, they were sick very soft.

These cookies are delicious! Some people may like them a bit spicier, but I don’t care for strong gingersnaps so these are perfect for me. One tip I have is they are a bit sticky to roll in your hands, so chill the dough a bit in the refrigerator. They will roll much easier.  It took 12 minutes at 375 degrees and they were crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.

This is Mom’s recipe. I don’t know who Mom is, but I’d like to volunteer to be adopted. This recipe is soo good. I’m making three batches for Christmas Meals on Wheels deliveries. I’ll have to make some more for the family. Mmm! I made it just as it says. I baked for 9 minutes and let the cookies sit for another minute before removing and cooling on a rack.

First batch burned but once I got the timing right the cookies were delicious! I doubled the majority of the spices but tripled the ginger to give it more of a kick. I also added about a teaspoon or two of nutmeg. Really happy with the results!

Absolutely loved. I did double the spice, because I really love ginger. I was baking in an unfamiliar oven and the first batch or two were a little more done, but all of them were eaten with approval.

This recipe absolutely needs a 1/2 to 2/3 c more flour than called for it be able to roll it.  

Listen up gluten free folk:  Being allergic to wheat I used Bob's 1:1 gluten free flour and also used medicated cannabis coconut oil that I make.   Made 42 cookies.
They work extremely well with gluten free flour.  The nature of the crunch in the cookie is perfect and you don't feel like you will break your teeth as you would with regular floured snaps.  The spices do a great job of hiding the flavor of cannabis.

Very yummy! Substituted Splenda brown sugar (1/2 cup) for 1 cup brown sugar. A little less carbs for me (diabetic) also used 1/2 wheat and 1/2 white flour. They were delicious. Family gobbled them up so making double the recipe today.

These cookies are really tasty.  I love that they don’t use butter, so no waiting for it to come to room temperature.  My only issue was that my molasses was a little runny so my dough didn’t get thick enough to roll into balls.  I used a scoop and just sprinkled with course sugar.  My husband loved these.  I will definitely make these again.  I think the spice level was pretty good but wouldn’t hurt to add more if you like a spicier cookie.  I liked the recipe as is!  Thanks for posting .

I am gluten free so I substituted Pamela's Baking and Pancake mix instead. The cookies came out beautifully, I may add extra ginger next time as I like ginger snaps a little spicier.

These are amazing.  My husband is very picky about his finger snaps and he asks me to make these every year for our week long camping trip.   I make one small addition......I always double the recipe and instead of doubling the ground ginger I do what it calls for of the ground finger and add 1 Tbsp of minced candied ginger and 1tsp of fresh grated ginger.  (I buy it for grated.so.it's easy).  We.like soft.cookies so I cut the time done to 8 min which makes crunchy edges and soft center.  SO GOOD!!!!

These are delicious, I made them a bit larger and added more ginger and cinnamon since I love that spicy bite. They weren’t really a snap, but there was a crunch that made these cookies a favorite of my for sure. Will definitely make these again.

I learned some important things making these cookies.
1)  double the spices 
2)  don't think twice about it...double the recipe!   I ate 4 cookies before my second batch was done.
3)  use a silicone baking mat, the sugar won't stick
4)   roll the whole cookie in the sugar.  (see above)
5)  the person who suggested putting oil in the measuring cup first then adding the molasses is a genius!
I'm usually  not a ginger fan but these are the best ginger cookies I have had!

I used an herb infused coconut oil and doubled up on the spices. I used a small coffee scoop to make small balls. Came out just like the picture about an inch and a half or so round. The taste is just like a store bought ginger snap. Caveat: Eat only one or maybe half depending on the strength of your oil.

Excellent easy recipe. Listened to a reviewer who suggested dabbing just the top in sugar instead of the whole ball, this worked great. I also slightly reduced the sugar bc we have two type 1 diabetics in the house. Otherwise I stuck to the recipe. My family devoured these.

Great recipe. Simple bake and prep. great taste and the proper snap. These burn on the underside VERY quickly. exercise caution when cooking as once they have started to burn, you can't undo it. I learned on my first batch and pulled them 2 minutes before the timer was done. Perfect.

Honestly, these are great! I know, not super healthy, but we are making COOKIES here folks, no matter how you make them, they never turn into vegetables. Lol.

Now, the only thing that I did different is add 2 tablespoons of raw ginger. We like that extra bite. But honestly, these came out great!

Made it as per this recipe and they came out softer than a ginger snap should be, but were **incredibly** popular at a family holiday meal -- even evil-Aunt Muffy, the New England puritan, did not complain about the evils of sugar and fats and was seen going back again and again!  I would like to get them thinner and snappier, but that is perhaps my issue and not the recipe :D

I made these, but added a little more ginger and cloves. It was warm in my kitchen, so I put the dough in the fridge for about 10 minutes to make it less sticky. That made rolling them SO MUCH EASIER!

Wow these cookies are amazing!!! I wish I could rate them more stars. I had to substitute dark maple syrup for the molasses, but they still turned out excellent. The cookies are good sized ( I actually ended up with 26 instead of 24) I will definitely be making these again!

I followed the recipe as written (I, too, don't understand how people can rate a recipe when they change it - just stupid people).  The cookies had a strange texture...not sure how to describe it other than a solid power taste.  They were OK, but I wouldn't give to friends as a good recipe.

These cookies turned out looking beautiful but I did not like the flavor. I was using new spices and I read a lot of reviews of people who suggested doubling the amount of spice, and I saw other reviews of people who said that was too much spice so I met in the middle and added one and a half times the amount ofspice and I honestly couldn't taste any Ginger or cinnamon and I only tasted molasses. I baked 6 of the cookies froze the rest. But I decided to throw then all out and try a new recipe. I would not recommend this recipe.

I tweaked it.  But I love this simple recipe.  Great for beginners and for those that don't want to get out for emergency sweets.    I doubled the spices, added white sugar to the dough instead of on top, used butter instead of oil.  I like mine crunchy. I got what I wanted.  Crunchy cookies that are NOT gooey with lots of flavor!  Thanks for the recipe!

The secret is to use 1.5 times the spices AND refrigerate the dough for at least 6hours, 24 hours is best, before baking.  Roll the hot cookies and granulated sugar after baking.

My husband asked for ginger cookies that were just under crunchy, found this recipe and it hit the nail on the head. I followed the recipe exact, but refrigerated the dough for about 2 hours before rolling them into balls and baking. They have a strong yet sweet ginger flavor and are just under crunchy. I baked them for 10 minutes and used parchment on my cookie sheet. Browned just right. They are now an instant tradition.

I think these are really good.  The difference between 10 and 12 minutes is a "Ginger cookie" and a "Ginger Snap".  I made exactly as directed.  The dough is the perfect consistency and stickiness for a good roll in sugar.  Just a couple of things I did that might help if you don't realize already:
1 - have a clean pair of rubber gloves you can easily take on and off to roll the cookies - it helps control the total mess
2 - stainless, non-coated cookies sheets made snaps in 12 minutes, coated cookie sheets resulted in overdone cookies at 12 minutes but 10 wasn't enough (at least with my oven and sheets). They are pretty yummy, I hope you give them a try.

These were very good and tasty and easy and quick to make. Crisp outside but moist inside. Tended to crumble a bit in storage, however.

Taste just how I like it be! Not too sweet and doesn't have a too gingerly taste.

I doubled the amount of the spices as suggested by others. 10min is just nice, else it gets too black and crunchy.

For those who likes it thin, can consider to flatten it, as it doesn't spread out too much.

Sweet, spicy, chewy inside, and delightfully crispy on the outside. Great holiday cookies! I was out of butter, so I was glad this recipe didn't call for it.

A yummy and easy to make Christmastime dessert.

This is by far my favorite ginger snap cookie recipe. Cookies come out perfect every time. I like to cook them a little less. About 9 minutes. This creates a softer chewier cookie.

This is what they look right out of the oven, however, they do flatten.  10 minutes seems to be too long so I bake mine 8-9 minutes.  Flavor is spectacular and everybody loves them, whether they come out chewy or a little on the crispy side.  Personally, I like them chewy so I bake them for less than the 10 minutes.

I made two batches, one just as the directions indicate (but I only got 23 cookies instead of the recipe yield of 36... bigger cookies!) and I cooked them for 10 minutes (but my cookies were bigger, so if you're making a true 36 yield, I'd pull them closer to 8-9 minutes). They are delicious and snappy. I baked a second batch with double the spices as I saw recommended by some on here, I don't think I'll do that again as they're a little to spicy for my kiddos. I also tried the larger grain sugar but prefer how the granular white sugar looks better. **Rating is for recipe as directed**

Great taste but none of mine flattened out or even crinkled much. They tended to burn too at that temperature. My balls remained balls, so I flattened them out but still they just sat there and baked, did not look anything like the picture and I followed the recipe to a "T". Not happy especially with such a high rating.

Made according to recipe and everyone loved them!   Going to double the recipe next time and bake one pan slightly longer to make them crisper and then crush them and use them as a base for a pumpkin cream cheese slice.

I only made 1 addition and one change.  I doubled the ginger and I added 1/2 tsp of ground cayenne pepper because I like gingersnaps that bite back.  If you like REAL bite add a whole tsp of cayenne--but they WILL be HOT and SWEET.
Addictive combo!!

I made these gluten free with Bob's Red Mill 1 for 1 baking flour.  They are probably the best gf cookies I've ever made and no one noticed they were gf! I did what several reviewers suggested and doubled the spices!

This recipe needs a better rating to 5 stars  I find it is easier and has the taste,  texture and results that all ginger cookie enthusiasts want. A real childhood memory comes with this recipe and I have converted many doubtful tasters.

Easy to follow and makes a decent cookie, though I will be altering next time. There wasn't enough flavor from the cloves, ginger and molasses for my liking, and I could taste the oil. I'm going to adjust the oil/molasses ratios to even that out a bit and add more spice next time I cook it.

I made these exactly as written and my husband and I loved them. They were slightly chewy the first day and crisper on the next but not too hard as some ginger snaps can be.

The flavor of these was terrific (I went only slightly heavy with the spices) but the consistency was such that rolling into a ball was impossible so I just dropped rounded teaspoonfuls and that worked fine. Didn't use additional sugar as I figured there was enough already.  No idea why the texture was so different; I followed the directions exactly. And they never got crispy which I would have preferred.  Will have to try again. Flavor was great though!

I am still tweaking this recipe.  My wife likes more ginger, so I added a half teaspoon of ginger to the recipe.  I also used dark brown sugar instead of light brown sugar.

If you are going to make these a lot, like I probably will, you might want to invest in a 1 1/4" (#70) cookie scoop.  It will make the job quick and easy for you.  
I made them exactly as written which is what I always tend to do the first time I try a new recipe.   I noticed the cookies puff up in the oven and then deflate and that is when I took them out.  My hubby  couldn't quit saying how wonderful they were and we thought the amount of spices called for was right on.  I baked them yesterday and I am having one with my morning coffee right now.   It is crunchy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside.  Perfection!

When I was making these cookies I was missing ground cloves. So I replaced the cloves, cinnamon, ginger with pumpkin pie spice, and it turned out WONDERFUL!!! These cookies taste so good! Rated 5 stars!!

I've made this  particular one at least 7 times. I always put 1 and 1/4 teaspoons in of cloves though, I find it really  enhances the taste. Made these for a few people, and everyone has loved them! These are also very enjoyable to bake. I find the rolling them into the balls, and then the sugar, extra fun!

I made these cookies but they came out too oily and hard.  So I used a different recipe using 3/4 cups of butter and they came  out great.  Sorry, but I rate mom's ginger cookie recipe a one. Now I am stuck with a batch of hard oily ginger cookies but at least my guests will receive a bag of soft delectable ginger cookies that I baked using the second recipe.

I took the advice of others and increased the amount of the spices and they are delicious.  The person who gave the tip about filling a measuring cup 3/4 oil then adding the molasses was right on target! No mess, molasses slid right out so thanks for the tip!

These were great - and I made them using Namaste gluten free flour (available at sam's club) 1 for 1, and there was no bad effects. It is so good to be able to lay out gluten free goodies at my christmas table. Every time you go to a pot luck or dinner these days, someone has food allergies and these cookies address the need just fine - AND THEY ARE EASY!

Took a few tries but perfected them after 3.  Do not sift the flour and ensure the dough balls are 2" apart on the cookie sheet.

Outstanding, easy cookie. As others suggested, I used 1 1/2 times the spices, and chilled in fridge about 15 minutes before rolling.

The only thing I did differently was chill the dough for an hour or I made the dough the night before. It seemed to handle better.

I LOVE these cookies. I have a picky eater and he couldnt stop eating them. Mr Peanut butter cookie or bust ate these. I had to cook them 3 minutes longer as I have a convection oven and the middle didnt want to get done. But they have a nice soft crunch to them, are just enough ginger and clove and leave a pleasant aftertaste. Very warming on a cold day for sure

These were good but you definitely have to follow the tips below and 1.5 the spices. I also turned my oven down to 350 because the first batch just nuked. 375 is just too high for cookies in my opinion. I refrigerated my dough for a while so they didn’t spread out too far and cooked them for 8 minutes and they were perfect! I will probably use this recipe again

I have made this recipe at least 30 times, my family loves it! I eventually converted it to a protein bar recipe by simply exchanging one of the cups of flour for a cup of protein powder. It's delicious!

I will make these again, but I would make 2 changes. I would increase the spices, especially the ginger, as others have suggested, and I would flatten the rolled balls as mine didn't flatten out they way the cookies in the picture did. Flavour was still good though.

These were great! I baked them for 10 minutes and they came out a bit crunchier than I like, so next time I'll try 9 minutes. Otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing.

The first thing I tasted was the oil! I did not like these. I made it exactly how the recipe  was written. Unfortunately now I have to find another recipe as I  would not give these to anyone! I will definitely be using butter or margarine next time but I will NOT be using this recipe.

I only use butter in baking (subbed for oil) and oopsy used full 1 cup so cookies came out super thin and crunchy OMG a wonderful "mistake" I will bake these all the time. This way they come out crunchy and super thin, I love them, but do not end up looking like picture (tops are crackly but like 1/4 inch thin). Please note I live at just under 7000 feet, so I never  know how that might change things, I just make recipes and see how it goes!

I love this recipe!!! I have made this, following the recipe exactly, and they tasted great. However, I also made a small change. I used 6 tablespoons oil and 4.5 tablespoons Greek Yogurt. This version turned out a little puffier, but still delicious. My advice? This recipe is great and you should feel free to experiment with it, as it is pretty hard to mess up.

My goodness, what's better? They taste great AND my kitchen smells terrific! I love a crispy cookie with spice and these fit the bill. The use of molasses adds a depth to the flavor that tastes like a classic recipe. This is a keeper and a new favorite in my home!

Next time I'll make half a batch because I can't stop enjoying them!

I made these gluten free by substituting my flour blend instead of all purpose and they turned out great. I did follow other reviews and doubled the spices. I baked for 10-12 mins and they were still soft so next time I may try to bake longer to get them to crisp up a bit. I used dark brown sugar and only covered the tops with white sugar.

These cookies were delicious! The only change I made was to add more cinnamon (1/2tsp more) and bake on greased (spray) cookie sheet. Slight crunch on outside and soft on the inside! Yummy!

I love this recipe. I've used it for years now. It's simply delicious using the original recipe.
I do like tweaking it a little to my own taste by substituting a half cup of flour with ground flax seed, and adding in a teaspoon or so of freshly ground ginger root just for extra kick. But it's wonderful just as it is, too.

I was looking for a recipe that didn't use shortening because no one in this house will ever use shortening in anything. I must have gone through 15 recipes to find this one. I made them and they were certainly very crisp and not too sweet. But the spices were kind of lost. I put in the exact amounts according to the recipe, changing nothing. The others in my household like them so they'll eat them. But for me, they just weren't spicy enough.

Hubby says "best ever". I, too, doubled the spices and they are perfect. Baked 9 minutes and came out soft and chewy, the way we like em. Stayed soft in the cookie jar too, but they only lasted two days around here.

WOW!!!!! These are FANTASTIC! Super easy to make and soooo delicious! I also tried another popular ginger cookie from this site, but I liked these a lot better. I shared some with my mom who immediately called me to give her the recipe. I cannot wait to make these for the holidays~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

The only change I made to the recipe was to double up on the spices. Just because I know I like an intense spicy flavour, I'm someone who puts 1tsp of cinnamon on my morning bowl of oatmeal!!! These cookies are delicious! My only mistake was not making a double batch because they won't last long! They have a delicate crispy texture which I really enjoyed. Not hard (no snap) like other ginger snaps. I read some comments about the unusual, soft texture of the dough and some found it hard to work with, to overcome this I used a small scoop. By scooping the dough directly into a bowl of white sugar I was able to toss them and place onto parchment lined cookie sheets without having to handle it as much!! Worked like a charm! Added to my favorites and will make again and again!

Wonderful, I make these all the time, and recently, I have been doubling the ground cloves, I love the taste of cloves. Also, I think this recipe is just as easy as your typical chocolate chip cookie, however much more tasty.

I made the cookies exactly like the recipe said, without making any changes - except to add a bit of flour as the dough was quite oily.  Baked them for 12 min at 375 deg in my convection oven and they came out perfectly.  The one thing I didn't like was that they were very "greasy/oily" tasting.  I used Wesson oil that was fresh so it had to be the amount in the recipe. Will go back to another one that uses shortening as this is my very favorite cookie.

Got really good reviews on the first time I made this. People really liked how the cookie was a little crisp on the outside, but a little soft on the inside. Only problem, was that I quickly ran out of them!

The second time, I tried to double the recipe but found it was dry and hard to mix. Added a little more oil, but the cookies still turned out sort of dry. I'll stick to making single batches next time, as they turned out perfect without changing any of the ingredients in the recipe.

Great recipe! I love the zip from the spices, used exact amount of spices listed in recipe. I used crisco shortening instead of vegetable oil. I baked the cookies about 8 min to keep them chewy.  Entire family loved them!

This is a great  recipe! I followed it exactly  until it came to the spices (I like my gingerbread spicy) So I doubled the spices and I still didn't find it quite enough. I will add even more next time. This recipe is a keeper!

I have made these for about five years, but just now getting around to reviewing. They are excellent! I recently started putting them on a silicone baking mat, and it helps a lot with the sticking to the cookie sheet issue I sometimes had. I make them for Christmas cookie exchanges primarily, but also make a batch or two for my sister-in-law each year because she seems to enjoy them thoroughly. Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe was great! The only reason why i made it four stars was because i made a few changes. First i did about a few TBLs. less of oil due to a previous recipe with the same amount and came out too oily. The amount of oil this time was perfect:)I added a little more of each spice just to make it spicier, and i think i'll add a little more next time. For me 8 min. on the cookies were perfect because they weren't over done and slightly burn't ( with 10-12 min) and still stayed chewy the next day!

These are fabulous!  This is the first time I made Ginger Snaps and I'm so glad I tried this recipe!  It's so easy to make and comes out perfectly.  They're softer than I thought ginger snaps would be, but I LOVE that they're not too crisp.

Fantastic recipe. I have had several people ask me for it (after finally convincing them they were home made and not bought from a bakery). Mine turned out perfectly chewy because I love them this way, a little extra time in the oven may make them "snap."

SO GOOD! I followed the recipe exactly as is and am super pleased with the result. The cookies are perfect for a cool winter day and will make great Christmas gifts.  They calorie content is pretty low (per cookie) for anyone who is calorie conscious which, in my opinion, makes these a win all the way around.

Went strictly by the recipe, and they were GREAT!  My daughter says she will never buy gingersnaps from the store again.  They were not oily, as i read in one review. Mine were crispy, but I liked that.  The only change I would make is to roll the balls smaller next time, and I definitely will be making these again.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

They crackled so pretty! I doubled the ginger and cinnamon and added a pinch more cloves. Perfect spices. Instead of molasses I used Steen's Pure Cane Syrup because it's what I always have on hand. Dark molasses may be a bit better but not by much. Everyone loves them. Keeper.

I followed suggestions from reviewers: 350 degrees for 10 minutes, double spices. Mine taste great, and are very "snappy" but are much larger than I anticipated!! I was expecting smaller cookies, but even after using a small-sized melon-baller, they stretched to over 2 inches each!

Outstanding.  Even better four or five days later, without refrigeration or freezing.  Do not be shy with the spices.  A wonderful molasses-ginger flavor with lots of cloves in the background.

I make it exactly as the recipe states and I love the tip another reviewer gave about putting your oil in a measuring cup and then adding the molasses to it (watching your measures carefully).  It slides out easily every time!  I chill the dough a bit before I form the cookies.  A family favorite.  Love it!

We love this recipe. My kids get carsickness bad, so I take these on every trip and we take a sweet break while we are driving sometimes, the ginger helps so much!  I have made these dozens of times and have stumbled on a couple of changes.  First I use coconut oil because one time it was all I and had, and HOLY YUM, it adds a fantastic flavor.  Second, I bake them 9-10 mins at 350 so they stay soft and chewy, that's our preference.  You really can't go wrong with this recipe.  The dough is way different than other cookie doughs, but trust the recipe, it's fabulous!

Perfect as is.  Dough stiffens up and I just used two teaspoons to form balls. Sugar before and after baking.  Perfect, perfect cookies. Tip on  adding molasses in 3/4 cup of veg oil was genius.  Please try this recipe as is.  It is delightful.

Made these last night for my BF who loves ginger snaps. They came out perfect! He loved them and so did my coworkers. I didn't have any clove which I thought I did, but I used allspice and they turned out great. I did double the cinnamon, ginger, and allspice because I like things a bit spicier.

Quick, easy, and great tasting.  My wife loves them and never tires of them. I make them every couple of weeks or so. I doubled all the spices but other than that I made it as written.

Several months later and this is still a big favourite at my house. No one is getting tired of them

Since this was my first time making ginger snaps, I followed the recipe to a tee. The raw cookie dough tasted horrifying and I put them in the oven with very bad feelings. However, the finished product was surprisingly good-tasting with a nice chewiness when fresh. I found them a bit too sweet and the molasses flavor to be slightly overpowering, and I agree with the reviews saying that the oil taste isn't that nice. I will never make them with oil again, butter everyday. Also, make sure to only slightly brown them as they are hard as a rock the next day. Next time I will use more cinnamon, less molasses and creamed butter, and take them out 2 minutes earlier.

My family almost starting fighting over these cookies, the only way I could stop them for yelling was to promise to make each household a bath.  SO I will give these a 5 or 5.  Thanks so much for this recipe.

Made these with a few changes based on reading other reviews. I doubled the spices, added a half cup of crystallized ginger and cooked them at 350 for exactly 8 minutes. Recipe yielded 3 dozen when scooped with a half size cookie scoop. Tasted better the day after baking (were a little weird straight out of the oven). The tops cracked perfectly.

These were amazing. I added an extra teaspoon of cinnamon to bring out more of  the spice flavor. They do come out pretty big, so you can make them smaller and you'll make more smaller cookies.

I made it using fresh ginger instead of ground ginger.  I refrigerated the dough for about 20 minutes to make it more manageable, used a medium sized scoop to place on baking sheet, and then sprinkled with sugar instead of rolling the cookies in it. 

Baked on parchment paper to keep them from sticking.  Baked beautifully.

I made these cookies and they turned out delicious I'm only 13 years old and they were very easy to make.The only "substitution" that I made was I used olive oil instead and pour in what I thought was 3/4 cups, however if I had vegetable oil I would have used it. With the spices, I'm not the biggest fan of cloves, so I put a little less. As for ginger put in amount that it says mix your dough and then take tiny piece and taste it. If you like more ginger like I do you could add a little more. When they are done baking, I suggest taking them off before they completely harden. I'm so glad I made these cookies they have lots snap and are very good!

My mother used to make these when I was a kid and I've been making them for my kids.  I LOVE these.  I cook them a little shorter than is recommended as I like mine a little softer and chewier.  These are awesome!  I make them every Christmas and this year is no exception.

Excellent recipe.  I didn't have cloves so doubled the ginger and added just under a tsp of cardamom.  They came out delicious and beautifully crackled.  Starbucks has discontinued their ginger molasses cookies (my daughter's favourite) so I've been searching for a good substitute to make at home.   I think I've now found something even better!

I agree with the their reviews.  Double the spice.  I didn't use the amount of white sugar in the recipient (it was too sweet for me).  A sprinkle before baking was more than enough.  They turned out just like the pic and as taste as good as they look.

Super simple recipe!!!  Only change ....I doubled the spices. Intended to send these to my sister living in another state, yeah, right. Not gonna happen. Need to make another batch tomorrow.  Baked for 8 minutes, turned out crispy around the edges, soft in the middle. Yum.  ALSO...the tip about using the same measuring cup for the molasses after adding the oil. Genius!! The molasses just slides out. Thank you!!!

The only change I made, is I use 100% Whole Wheat in all my recipes instead of white flour, and doubled all spices because I like extra spices.
 These are so perfect, that I ate 1/2 a batch in one sitting!  
Best Ginger Snaps Ever!  Recipe is a keeper.
ps:  I may tweak it w/a different sugar and oil, to see if I can make a "Ginger Snap Energy Bar" after the Holidays.

This is by far the very best ginger snap recipe I've ever tried and will forever be my go to.  The cookies stay moist and chewy!  I've been asked to hurry and make them again.

I have been making this recipe for years and EVERYONE loves the cookies! Honestly. I follow the recipe, too, no subbing. My only advice (because I like my cookies a little softer) is after they cool, and I go to put them away, place a small piece of bread in the container or bag with the cookies. Don't let it touch the cookies, put it on a napkin or something, but that helps make the cookies stay soft. Works for any cookies. It's the best trick I've ever learned!

Too bland for me. Would have added more spices, probably clove and cinnamon. Turned out well, though. Good recipe, as I had everything on hand except molasses.

I did double the spices as previous reviews suggested. We like then spicier - and I shortened the cooking time on the second batch to about 7 min.

I love this cookie.  I have been making it for several years for my family and our Railway Village festivals.  Everyone loves them.  I make them as listed in the recipe.  I use Allrecipes change the amount to make the recipe for 12 dozen cookies. Thanks

These are the best Ginger Snaps I've ever made! Hubby thought I ordered these from a specialty shop --- way better than store bought. Just made a few small changes. Set oven at 350 -- as for all cookies. (We use organic ingredients when possible). Doubled amounts of cloves and cinnamon and used 1 tablespoon ginger. Kept dough in fridge 10 min (or so), which made handling much easier. Dipped only tops into colored decorator sugar. Used parchment paper, which made clean up a breeze. Baked 8-9 min. on top oven rack. Just follow directions exactly and enjoy the outcome!  You'll want to share these, and hide some as well! ^_^

An excellent ginger cookie. I followed the recipe although I added double the amount of spices as I really love the traditional ginger snap spicy taste. Next time I will also add fresh grated ginger and black pepper and perhaps a touch of cayenne because I like a hot cookie!

I loved these! I made them gluten free (I put my picture on here they are the flat ones??) so they didn't look too pretty. I would rate four stars for that but I altered the recipe and gluten free is hard to bake with. I did what the comments said and added more spices and it was fine! Great cookies

Loved this recipe! I used fresh ginger that I grated in place of ground and they turned out great. I've made them twice now and they disappear so fast. If they are too sweet my recommendation is to use half brown/White sugar and add a tablespoon of molasses to make dark brown.

Fabulous recipe! My first batch was for a friend suffering from nausea due to chemo (ginger helps settle the stomach). She loved them and so did we! Now I am on the 4th batch, continuing to make them for my friend following chemo and today-they will be tested by the grandkids! Made similar changes as other reviewers-more spices and less cooking time.

Yummy ginger snaps.  My first time to make any ginger snaps and I could not be happier.  Now if I could just stop eating them.  I did have to shorten the bake time to 8 minutes but my oven always cooks faster.  Thanks for such a good easy recipe.

First time with this recipe. I followed it to the letter, with the exception that I used 1.5 Tbsps of freshly ground ginger, instead of 1 tsp of dried ground. They literally look identical to the recipe photo. The only problem is that I now need to make another batch, because half of them didn't last until cooled, and now I no longer have enough to take to work on Monday.

These are the best Ginger Snap Cookies I have ever made! YES, DOUBLE ALL SPICES! Cook only 8 minutes, leave on pan until slightly cooled, or slightly firm, this will result in soft chewy "perfect" cookies!

Made 12 servings and accidently put more than 1/2 an egg. I'm assuming that's why the cookies spread out so much but it was still tasty.

I was hoping for a "snap" to my ginger snap...it was a soft cookie with not enough ginger. If you like a softer ginger snap then this is a good recipe...if you like a really gingery cookie then double (at least) the ginger.

Perfect the way they are! Crispy on the edges and soft in the middle at 10 minutes. My kids won't eat heavily spiced food so these were perfect.

Just finished baking these about an hour ago. I mixed them in my Kitchen Aid stand mixer. As many others did who reviewed this recipe I doubled the spices {cloves,cinnamon, ginger} and I'm so glad I did. Cookies were not overly spicy but perfect. I love them for the following reasons: Tasty,visually appealing round with cracks,nice crunchy texture, quick, easy,more healthy {for people with cholesterol problems such as my Husband} because this recipe uses oil instead of butter, recipe only requires common pantry ingredients which I normally have on hand, dough is very easy to work with. Keeper!

Followed recipe to the T; cookies came out burnt at the bottom and I can barely taste the ginger...needs more spicy flavor, and less sugar.

This recipe is DELICIOUS! The aroma filled the entire house! I did tweak the spices a bit; I cut the clove measurement in half, and I added a bit more ginger and cinnamon to punch up the flavor. These cookies came out amazing. They were soft, crispy, and chewy at the same time. These cookies were the best Ginger Snap cookies I have ever tasted. I LOVE THEM!

These are my favorite gingersnap cookies ever!  I normally double the spices, as my family loves a "spicy" cookie.   I also refrigerate the dough for a bit before baking, and this keeps the dough from spreading out too much while baking.  The end result is a perfectly round cookie that is just the right thickness.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe! I'd never had ginger snaps before. My husband recommended them after we followed a mahi mahi recipe (from here) that had ginger in it, and we needed something to do with what was left. These were super yummy! I did leave out the white sugar though. But it didn't need it...had the perfect combo of sweet/spicy anyway.

I just made this recipe and it is GREAT!!!  Usually the first time a find a recipe that I want to try, I stay close to the recipe and then adapt it to change it up when I make it the next time.  This recipe is GREAT just as it is!!  I love a chewy cookie and the spices are just right!!! Thanks Elaine, for sharing this Super Ginger Snap.

I doubled the recipe - i had a feeling i would regret only making one batch -and doubled the spices as other reviewers have done.  These turned out great.  Everyone loved them.  I should have quadrupled the recipe! Yum!

Loved this recipe.  The cookies I made from it are going fast so I'm sure I will have to bake up another batch before too long.  Delicious and with a nice snap to them.

Incredibly tasty, addictive, and so darned easy to make. In addition to doubling the dried ginger, I added 2 tbl of crystallized ginger and 1 tsp of fresh ginger, both finely minced.  I did not add the cloves. I only got 18 cookies (about 3-1/2" diameter when cooked- well, it seemed like I rolled a 1-1/4 ball, but apparently not), which gave them a crispy sugary exterior and a yummy chewy slightly softer center. the molasses and ginger flavor can through wonderfully. The brown, cracked top looks like a professional made them. A keeper!

The ratios and cooking time seemed all wrong. Mix was incredibly runny. The cookies burned after just 6 minutes in the oven.

The recipe I usually make calls for butter but I didn't have enough so I tried this one.  Some of the reviews said that the dough was sticky and hard to handle but I didn't find that at all.  This doesn't need any tweaking - the cookies are perfect.

Love this recipe, it makes such a great soft texture which is perfected by the sugar coating.  Just ensure not to overbake them or they will get hard & burnt sugar never tastes good!

Those where delicious, the only problem is that can't eat just one...They are just like my mother used to make! By the way mine did not burn, you need to use a lighter shade of cookie sheet, heard that from a chef and now...Never burn cookies anymore!

Great recipe, although I definitely recommend chilling the dough before baking.  It will make it so the sugar stays on the outside, and its easier to roll into balls.  A lot of people recommend doubling the spices, I think that would really overpower things.  Love these just as they are.  With this cookie being dark it can be a tad difficult to tell when these are done.

I also doubled the spices...just the cinnamon and ginger (I like cloves but don't love it so chose not to double that) and I also chopped up 4 oz of crystalized ginger into very tiny pieces adding it to the dough and they came out perfect.  Love this recipe, so easy and great for the holidays.  New annual favorite.

Successfully converted this recipe to GLUTEN FREE! Substitute for the 2 C flour: 1 C Pamela's GF baking mix (or other gf flour mixture), 1/2 C almond flour, and 1/2 C white rice flour.  Add 1/2 tsp xanthan gum. I followed the comments that suggested doubling or 1 1/2ing spices. I did 1 1/2, but I don't know that it was necessary. Probably good either way. Also took advice to dip only top of cookie in sugar and to lightly grease cookie sheet.

I didn't have molasses so I used honey instead, and I used more cinnamon and ginger... but other than that I did everything else the same and they turned out perfect. Everyone in the house loves them. I will definitely be making these again.

This is a good recipe!  I do love spicy food with a little heat, so next time I make these I will add about 1 1/2 Tbs of fresh grated ginger and see how much of a stronger taste I can get.  But they are yummy as they are!

I had never made ginger snaps before, but wanted to try. I didn't have any molasses, but I did have sorghum syrup, so I used that, and Ultragrain flour. Everything else was straight from the recipe

These. Cookies. Were. FABULOUS. The second sheet was in the oven just a minute or two less than the first, and was even better. I've printed the recipe to keep it handy. Thanks!

I read the reviews before making these and made 2 batches, 1 where i added extra spices as a lot of people suggested and 1 following the recipe as is. I have to say I really liked them better without the added spices. this is the perfect cookie. Super easy to make, you dont have to chill dough etc. they came out perfect and pretty. I was making them for a fiesta party so i iced them with a chocolate chili buttercream. They were amazing and a hit everyone loved them. One thing though, I did not roll them in sugar, they were perfect without it.

People who like gingersnaps, like these ones.  Missing a star because I do higher quantities of the spices.  As is they are less exciting.

I made the recipe as is, and we all though it was quite yummy!  The second time I reduced the oil to 2/3C to cut down on the fat, and noticed no difference in the result.  I haven't played with doubling the amount of spices because here in Spain they are hard to come by!

These are some of the best cookies I have ever eaten! I followed the recipe exactly as written, baked them for 10 minutes at 375F and ended up with two dozen soft ginger snaps - just the way I like them! The dough was rather oily and hard to roll, but I didn't worry too much about the shape. It all evens out when they spread out during baking. I will definitely be making these again - perhaps later today when my husband and I finish off this first batch :)

I am in LOVE with this recipe.  Ginger snaps are one of my weaknesses and these are the best.  I did double the spices as suggested by others and they were just spicy enough.  I looked for the decorating sugar crystals but couldn't find them so I used sugar in the raw (bigger crystals than granulated)  and they turned out perfect--sparkly and crackled. I only sugared the top which eliminated the burned sugar on the bottom.   I also used parchment paper for the first time and I'll never use cooking sprays again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Good flavour - I didn't change the spices at all.  Seemed strong enough to me.  I did add an extra 1/2 cup flour as it was impossible to "roll the dough into balls" as it was a big sloppy mess.  I don't know if it has something to do that I live in a humid country and at sea level but the definitely had to have more flour.  In any event, I liked the recipe because it used veg oil rather than shortening, butter or margarine.

The ONLY thing that I changed about this recipe was rolling the tops of the cookies in yellow decorator sugar instead of the white granulated. They were delicious and gorgeous. An excellent recipe! I made mine smaller and baked for 7-8 minutes. Perfect!

These were good, but I pulled them out at seven minutes and let them sit on the rack for ten to "continue baking" because I like them to be tough on the outside and soft on the inside. I baked about 200 of these, made half of them by the recipe and the other half a little soft, and they were excellent both ways (: they are sure to be a hit at my thanksgiving dinner!

I followed directions exactly, but got very flat, un-crinkled, couldn't-even-tell-I-sprinkled-sugar-on-them cookies. Disappointed with the appearance but they are *delicious*. Also, they flatten out like crazy, (they were so gooey I couldn't even roll them in the sugar, just sprinkled the tops) so do not put more than 9 on a pan.

I have a good ginger cookie recipe (Betty Crocker Cookbook) but thought I'd try something different. I followed the recipe with the exception of adding additional spices because mine were not fresh, but these cookies just had a weird consistency. They rose in the oven and then flattened out completely.  I don't know how others saw "crinkles". Disappointed, I'll stick to my other recipe or store bought from now on.

These were so easy to make, and the end results are just mouth-watering! They firm up very nicely when cooled so I can stack them into a variety of fun shapes for the kids. For Halloween I'm going to decorate them with pumpkin faces for an easy treat in between trick-or-treaters.

This recipe is amazing! (with a little bit of help). I have made the recipe three times now, and the first time I made it just as the recipe says. It was okay, but it tasted kinda bland and doughy. I highly recommend increasing the spices to 1 tsp ginger, 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and 1 tsp cloves. And I always add a little extra molasses for good luck. I can't make them fast enough now!

so so so so yummy. i have never had any of my cookies turn out as awesome as these!! i doubled the clove and added an extra 1/2 tsp of ginger because i like extra spice. also put the batter in the freezer for a little while to firm it up and keep it from sticking all over your hands.

I've made this recipe quite a few times now so I thought it was about time I reviewed it. These are delicious and I didn't change the recipe at all. I've had Ginger snaps that were either too crispy, or too chewy, or not "gingery" enough...but these come out perfect on all counts. Thanks Elaine, I'll be making these alot...especially since my husband LOVES them

WOW these are incredible! Ginger snaps are my favorite cookie and these are the best I've ever had. They came out crispy and chewy and yummie. I will make these over and over again.

Not a "snap" cookie at all as they are soft in the middle and only a little crunchy on the outside.  if you need the "snap" then this is not the recipe.  I used a little less oil and a little more flour.  They turned out just like the picture and lasted only a few hours in my house.  A big hit!

This is a great recipe. I spilt my ginger on the floor so I used allspice in it's place. It was very good and they stayed soft for 2 days (we ate all of them by 2 days)

AWESOME! I normally do not like molasses in my food but these were scrummy and were all gobbled up in a couple of days (I have 4 kids!). Thanks for the recipe.

I was also very worried when I made these the first time because the dough was so soft, but they came out beautifully. Best of all, they taste even better than they look. It is difficult to find a non-dairy cookie recipe that turns out well- this one will become my regular ginger snap recipe.

These cookies are wonderful!!!  I always get many compliments on them.  This christmas, I had already made a batch and got a request for another.  I ran out of brown sugar, but had approx 3/4 of a cup.  I used white sugar to make it to the full cup required.  They didn't really cracke and came out thin and crispy. Everyone LOVED them!  Not sure which version I'll continue to make in the future.  Either way - this is the only spice cookie I make!!

I'm making them for the second night in a row; 1st set were gifts. I cut down on the cloves, and doubled up on the ginger and cinnamon. What a great recipe. I am not a fan of the crunchier GingerSnaps, this recipe is perfect for  what I was looking for.    Thanks for sharing!

I too doubled the spices.  The flavor is good, but I was hoping for a moister cookie.  I cooked them for 10 minutes at 350 and find them a bit dry (but still not hard or crunchy).  Reading over some previous reviews now I wonder if I had cut that back to 8 minutes if they'd be more like I wanted.

I have never made ginger snaps before.  I altered the recipe by doubling the spices and added 1/4 cup more flour as well as substituting butter (melted) for vegetable oil.  The recipe doesn't state what kind of molasses but I used blackstrap.  The dough was workable for me and was easy to use.  Everyone that tried the cookies thought that they were fantastic.  Some said that they have never liked these kinds of cookies before until they had this recipe.  The cookies turned out exactly like the picture too.  I did not have any problem with the cookies sticking to the pan.  I only cooked them for 9 minutes.

Perfect!  This makes beautiful cookies.  The dough is too soft to roll, so I just scooped it out with my cookie dough scoop and sprinkled sugar on top.  I'll be making these again!

Oh my..if I could give these 10 stars I would!  Did just a few VERY MINOR adjustments..didn't quite double the spices, just used very round teaspoons full..and added about a 1/4 more flour (more for my altitude adjustment).  I made the balls much smaller than what the recipe called for so I could get a crunchy, small cookie. (about half the size) Also used green and red decorating sugar with the regular sugar just for a pretty sparkle!  The cookies are perfect!  (can't stay out of them darn it!)

These are great! I did like others had suggested...doubled the spices and cooked for 9 minutes to get something resembling "chewies". They look and taste great. This recipe is surprisingly easy as well. Next time I think I will take it up a notch and double the ginger again (4 tsp) and up the clove a bit more (maybe 1.5 tsp) because we tend to like a pretty spicy cookie. Not a reflection on the recipe, simply a taste preference.

These were very yummy! I had to use gluten free flour and the first few were very runny, so I added another cup to cup and a half of flour! Once I got the right ratio, they were perfect. :)

These are amazing! Never again will I buy ginger snaps. I did take the advice of others and use a little extra spice, but I think it would be great even without the extra zing. Also, I made mine big and cookie-y rather than snap-y since we're not big fans of crunchy cookies, and they still turned out incredible.

Lovely recipe-quick and simple to make. Like others, I doubled the spices and added freshly shaved ginger (as opposed to ground ginger).  Additional flour helped to make the dough more workable (the warmth of my hands flattened the balls prior to baking).  The cookies have incredible flavor and texture and come out of the oven perfect every time.

Yummy!  I am teaching myself to cook and loved these.  I did double the spices and used 1/2 cup oil and 1/4 applesauce.  I used a scoop to do most of them and they turned out okay, but if you roll them into the ball,they turn out looking just like store bought ginger snaps.  I love these and so do my boys.

The BEST ginger snaps I've ever eaten! We doubled the spices, as suggested by others, and used parchment paper to prevent them from sticking to the pan. The cookies were best in our oven after 10 minutes: that way, the outer shell (of sugar) is crisp and light, and the middle is chewy. Just delightful! The cookies will look and feel undone in the middle, but they will become harder - and, in this case, perfectly chewy - after you let them sit out for a few minutes. This is a 5-star recipe.   For a delicious dessert, I suggest sandwiching them around (homemade) cinnamon ice cream. Yum!   Thank you, Elaine, and other reviewers! :)

these cookies are great!    i have been making the big and soft ginger cookies from this site for years and decided to try a new recipe!   i am sooooo glad i did.  these are so much easier to make & the batter is easy to work with. The cookies turned out great!  my mother in law gave me a secret that if you sift the flour and spice mixture you get the cracking effect that is the only thing i did different and they turned out great!  ginger snaps are my grandpas fav so i always make him a batch for spacial occasions now they are my 2 1/2 yrs old sons favorite! thanks for sharing!

I upped the spices as many people suggested. The cookies had a lovely crisp texture and were soft on the inside, but the 2 tsp of baking soda were totally pointless. Every other cookie recipe I've seen never had baking soda without additional baking powder, and I could definitely taste it in this one.   Otherwise, for an butter-less cookie, this was good.

Excellent cookies!  I doubled the spices and these came out absolutely wonderfully: crispy and crackled on the outside and chewy on the inside.  I baked for 8 mins. and they were perfect.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Great recipe! A little spicy but in a good way. The batter is very sticky, I would recommend (even though it sounds strange) spraying your hands with a non-stick cooking spray.

Love this recipe! Very easy to make and I always have all the ingredients. I doubled the spices per other reviewers advice and used brown sugar Splenda. Also when I bake these cookies I always use my silicon baking sheets. No worries about cookies sticking and they come out wonderful everytime. Thanks for the recipe.

At first when they were still warm they seemed kind of oily, but after they cooled all the way I thought they were pretty good.  I overbaked them a bit so they got a little hard after a couple days, but still tasted good. I left out the cloves since I don't care much for them and I just used a couple of spoons and droped the dough on the cookie sheets.

Great recipe- super easy. The vegetable oil is a good substitution if you don't want to add all that butter. Perfect finished product- nice and cracked appearance and tasty too! Thanks.

Wonderful recipe!  Not too spicy. My 6 year old son loves them!!  The only problem I encountered was the dough ending up more like a batter.  I thought I may have only added 1 cup of flour so I added another.  The cookies came out great!  The second time I made them the dough was still sticky even though I made sure that I added the 2 cups of flour.  So I added another cup and this made the dough very easy to handle.  I also smooshed the balls down slightly so that the cookies came out large and flat.  Beautifully perfect for Christmas gifts!  Thanks!!

I love this recipe!  I was looking for a recipe like my grandma's and this one fit the bill.  I followed the recipe exactly except I baked them for only 8 minutes.  They were perfect - a little crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  Many of the reviews I read suggested doubling the spices but I saw no need.  I wouldn't change a thing.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!
I guess I'm kinda biased because ginger snaps are my favorite cookie :P
These are very good!  I did as some other reviewers suggested and doubled the spices, very glad that I did, they ended up with the perfect "kick".  I didn't let them cool long enough on the baking sheet, so they were crispy, I do like chewy.  Next time I won't be in such a hurry to get them onto the wire racks! Thank you for such a tasty treat!

11/2008: I made these just as the recipe states and they were delicious!! the only thing i did were heaping scoops of the spices since others recommended to add more.  Cant wait to bring them for the family tomorrow for thanksgiving tomorrow night! 11/2009: So a year later, i make these as is and they still taste Delicious!!...even without heaping scoops of spices! The batter was super oily, though! It was probably like that when i made these in the past, but it didnt bother me then.  Next time i may attempt to use slightly less than 3/4c of oil and see if that makes the batter any less soggy.

Fantastic! Based on others reviews I doubled ginger and reduced oil to 2/3c. I found I could taste the baking soda in the first batch, so made another using only 1 tsp which fixed that soda taste and didn't seem to make any coloring/rising difference.  Impressive for a cookie that doesn't use any butter.

I made these cookies on Saturday night and they are long gone.  My boyfriend loved them and his sister said they were the best gingersnaps she had ever had.  The only thing I did differently was double the amount of cloves (which was accidental).  They turned out perfect!

Yum!  I didn't have eggs so used a blend of potato flour and water.  As strange as it sounds it worked very well and even added some taste!  I also didn't have molasses so I replaced it with brown sugar/water.  I only used 3/4 cup of sugar and next time I'll use even less, and will probably put in way more ginger!  But all in all those were great cookies, easy and cheap to make.

These didn't turn out quite like I thought they would. They are still good, but not a favorite. I will probably make them again, but not frequently. Watch them carefully because I managed to burn about half of mine. They are spicy and sweet!

I've made this recipe for the past couple holiday seasons... they are my father in law's favorite! They also freeze really well.  I usually make a double batch a week or so before Thanksgiving and bring them out gradually throughout the holiday season.  This recipe is a winner!

Wonderfully easy to make, however the next time I will change the recipe just slightly:

- I like ginger snaps to be really spicy, and these were no where near spicy enough.  Next time I'll add 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper as many other recipes do

- I increased the ground cloves, ground cinnamon, and ground ginger by 1.5 what the recipe said, and this was perfect.

- All this molasses made the cookies more chewy and sweet, not hard and, well, snappy.  Next time I'll probably use less than 1/4 C.

DELICIOUS tho!

These were a hit in my family.  I ran out of brown sugar at 3/4 c so I filled the rest with white sugar.  I also didn't have cloves.  Even with these changes they turned out excellent!  Nice and crackly.  I overcooked the 1st batch, so I only cooked the rest for 6 min. Everyone loved them!

I found these to be kinda blah. I doubled the spices and they still lacked the zip I was looking for. I'll keep looking for a better recipe

Wow these cookies were excellent and super easy to make.  My daughter has soy allergies, so I have been searching for easy cookie recipes I can make during the week.  This one fits the bill, plus everyone thinks their great!

These amazing ginger snaps remain my all time favorite cookie, period. They always come out perfect - crispy edges, chewy middle, big spicy flavor, sparkly and round like Martha Stewart made them. Not to mention the batter is tasty. They always get rave reviews and they're so easy to make. I like to play with the kinds of sugar I roll them in, the size of the cookie, and the ingredients (sometimes I add lemon zest or chocolate chips or change the spices). These cookies remain consistently impressive. Thank you for this recipe!

This was a great recipe!  It took me literally 15 minutes from start to finish.  5 minutes for mixing, and 10 minutes to cook.  I didn't roll them in sugar... instead I sprinkled a tiny bit of sugar on after I took them out of the oven.  What a great recipe for pregnant women trying to kick morning sickness!

These cookies are always a hit during the fall months and especially Thanksgiving! I usually serve the ginger snaps with the "Pumpkin Dip" recipe by Sue Case. It's always a hit!!!! (I used wood carving tools and a homemade stencil to create the Red Sox logo)

My husband told me he liked Ginger Snaps.  I had no recipe for them, so I did a search and found this one.  It turned out so good.  Made plenty of cookies and it was very easy.  It's going in my "Collected Recipes" cookbook for sure!!

I love these ginger snaps! I'm not the kind of cook that can throw anything together and it tastes great. I have to have a recipe. I followed this one to a T and they came out great. I used the 1-1/2 inch Pampered Chef scoop, dipped top half in sugar and baked at 350 for 10 minutes.  I waited 5 minutes before I removed them from the cookie sheet. Then I finished cooling them on aluminum foil on my granite counter top. They were crisp on the outside, but still a little soft in the middle. They looked exactly like the picture and tasted great. I'll definitely make again.

my cookies came out absolutely flat! not at all pretty and crackled like the other reviewers pictures.They taste awesome though, so if you're aiming for great flavor (not appearance), this is the cookie for you.

These were sooo easy to make. I didn't need to refrigerate the dough at all; it was very easy to work with the way it was. I used parchment paper on the cookie sheets and it worked perfectly without sticking. I also doubled the cinnamon and ginger, like other reviewers suggested. When you eat them, there is a nice kick of ginger at the very end. I don't really like gingersnaps that much and I loved these. Cute and festive. Great recipe!

These cookies are fantastic !!  I like them because it calls for vegetable oil instead of margarine.  I double the spices.  They stay soft even after several days of baking.

This is my first time making any type of ginger/molasses cookie and I think they turned out really good. They are easy to make and so pretty too! I doubled the spices as other reviews suggested. I will make again but I also plan on trying some other ginger cookie recipes.

Very good cookie - I don't like them to spicy so this recipe worked great for me.  Mine spread out a lot but I liked the crispy-ness. I used Brier Rabbit Unsulfured Molassas cookies were very dark - yummy!

These are great.  Bake up nice, don't run or spread out all over the cookie sheet!  Gingersnaps were never a favorite until these.

Great recipe.  Like others I doubled the spices and reduced the cooking time to 8 minutes.  I also added 1/4 tsp. of cayenne pepper.  It added a wonderful "bite" to the cookies.  Definitely a keeper.

These were pretty good. I used dried ginger and the flavour wasn't strong enough. Next time I would try them with fresh gound ginger.

I baked up a batch of these to help combat pregnancy nausea, and EVERYONE loved them! I believe I doubled the spices, because I like them with a bit more bite. I gave a dozen to my neighbor (who is undergoing chemotherapy) and she thought they were wonderful as well. I'm probably going to bake another batch today.

Mine turned out on the thick side. It was hard to determine if they were ready to come out of the oven as they are brown when you put them in so  you can't go by color. I winged it and they tasted better then I expected.

Yummy!  I actually messed up the recipe and they were still good, a fool proof recipe!  I added the 1/3 C sugar to the cookie dough by mistake and they still tasted great.  I did a second batch without the sugar mixed in and they were also really good.  I'll definatly use this one again!

This is undoubtedly the easiest and best recipe for cookies I have ever tried.  The dough was not oily and came together quite nicely.  My oven runs very hot, so I cooked them at 340 for 11 minutes and they were perfect; I also doubled the spices because I wanted a "real" kick.  Thank you for a new favorite and I will be making this many more times.

these cookies are MONEY!!! 
I live overseas so I have no access to molasses, so I substituted pancake syrup for it, added about 1/2 cup more flour, and spooned it into the sugar and then rolled it. DELICIOUS!! Can't wait to get back home and try them with molasses!!

YUM YUM YUM!!  I made these cookies today in preparation for Christmas.  I plan on freezing them.  This was my first time making ginger snaps and I'm so glad I found this recipe, it's definitely a keeper.  I didn't change a thing in the recipe and they came out wonderful!

I made these last night for my cookie tins, even though I don't remember ever liking Gingersnaps. I could NOT STOP EATING THEM and had to put them straight into the freezer to get them out of sight. I'll make another few batches soon. Very easy to make, very delicious!

Great recipe! I am not a ginger fan, but loved the taste and texture of these cookies.  I increased the spices by 1.5 times and the taste was great.  I'll definately make again.

These cookies turned out great, even at Colorado's high altitude. I doubled up on the spices and tasted yummy, although don't do this if you're like me and like a sweeter cookie! I rolled them in different holiday sprinkles which made them more festive.

These cookies reminded me of my childhood, when my father made them regularly for us kids. I used only maybe ½ tsp of cinnamon because my husband is allergic, but that's the only change I made. Turned out GREAT! My first pan burned a little, and my oven usually runs cold.. So I had to cut it back to 350. After cooling, put them in a plastic container. Mine started hard, but after being in plastic a few hours, they softened up to the perfect chewiness... Yum! Thank you!!

Absolutely fantabulous! I added 1.5 times the spices and followed the recipe otherwise. I did refrigerate the dough for 15 min before baking. The result is great. The best part is that this recipe doesnt need butter or hydrogenated fat. I used cholesterol-free oil blend and no one cal tell that. Hats off to this recipe!!!

Made these exactly to recipe. Chilled the dough for the afternoon. Baked them for 11 minutes and they turned out crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. Turned out gorgeous, just like the picture. Delicious! Thank you.

I absolutely adore this recipe.  It's now my secret baking weapon.  I didn't bother measuring the spices but the more the merrier.

My boyfriend claims they were the best cookies he's ever eaten.

Make sure that you really mix the wet ingredients together and always undercook the cookies!

Rave reviews from everyone even the non-ginger lovers and my hard to please mother! Extra points for this recipe being so easy to make.  I doubled the cinammon and cloves and refridgerated the dough as per other members suggestions.

I made these cookies for a Christmas party. As suggested, I doubled my spices.  They turned out great.  Only problem, my 3 children and my niece and nephew couldn't stop eating them and I only ended up with 1/2 batch for my Christmas party.  Thanks for a great recipe.  Will definetly make again !

Made them today. This will be our only recipe for Ginger Snaps. We have about eaten them already. Added rounded tsp's of the spice. And also made the dough up yesterday, it over nighted it in the fridge and was much easier to form into the balls. I got 48 cookies, a perfect size.

Yum! These cookies are quick and easy.  I also doubled the amount of spices and thought they came out perfect.  I used a small ice cream scoop to drop the dough into the sugar, and that made it easy to roll and shape.  This is a keeper recipe!

These were so delicious--and not difficult to make.  They look beautiful when done and are so tasty.  They came out perfectly.  I liked having an oil-based rather than butter-based cookie, and the taste was great.

I made a batch this afternoon and ate them until I was sick. The only thing I did different was to grind my own spices. Using pre-ground might not give as much flavor.

These were good.......not great, but better than just ok.  I decreased the cloves to 1/4 tsp and increased the ginger to 1 1/2 tsp.  My first batch came out burnt, so I lowered my oven temp to 350 and only baked for about 8-9 min.  My kids are happily munching away on these cookies.

Loved this recipe.  Tried to use someone's suggestion of lowering the temp to 350 and baking for 6 mins for a softer cookie but it didn't work for me.  I ended up baking them for about 10 mins and they were pretty soft.  It's a keeper!

Delicious!  My 7 yr old daughter enjoyed making and eating these and especially loved rolling these in the sugar.  I used 2 tsp. of fresh grated ginger, but I should have used more.  I didn't have cloves so I used 1 tsp of allspice and that was fine too.

Somehow the dough was too sticky and soft to handle immediately so I had to refrigerate it for an hour. They rose in the oven but fell flat in the end, so though they tasted great, they were rather thin! Anyone else had this problem? :-)
