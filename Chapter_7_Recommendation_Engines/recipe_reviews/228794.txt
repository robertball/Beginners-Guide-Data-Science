Pretty good.  I needed more water than called for as it dried out. If you aren't used to the taste of agave, I recommend you add a little at a time, to taste.  I served this over pork chops.

I used Granny Smith apples in this recipe, honey instead of agave nectar (I didn't have agave nectar on hand) and I omitted the pepper. I actually cooked this in my slow cooker all morning, then cooled it and ran the apples and liquid through my food processor. This turned out very well.

I just made this and I think it's great! I used an apple corer/slicer after peeling the apples (no dicing) they will cook down. I did need a little extra water but that is easily adjustable and could been necessary due to the a unusual combination of apple varieties (Fuji and Red Delicious) I used. I needed to use them because the kids didn't eat them up quick enough! I wanted a recipe that would allow me to sweeten up the applesauce some, but without sugar. This turned out very good, exceeding my expectations!

Smells amazing! I just made some to go in a recipe I found for breakfast protein muffins so didn't actually eat it before baking it! I used one Bramley Apple and one golden delicious and halved all the other ingredients with honey and let it simmer until all the water had gone. I also left the skin on for a bit more texture and the extra nutrients

This was my first time making applesauce, and I found it very easy and yummy. The hardest part was dicing all the apples. I didn't have agave so I used honey. I did a half recipe and got plenty of applesauce. I ended with is a bit chunky, but that's completely because of the minimal effort I put into mashing it at the end.
