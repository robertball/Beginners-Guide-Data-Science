This was a very good recipe but needed some tweaking.  I used 2 limes instead of 3.  I added a half-cup of orange juice, a half-cup of honey and a small can of crushed pineapple to the marinade.  I marinated for 2 hours.  After pan-frying the shrimp, I poured the excess marinade in the pan and reduced by half to make a sauce.  I Toasted some coconut and added that to some white rice I made and poured the sauce over the rice and sprinkled the shrimp with some leftover toasted coconut.  Delicious!

I made this recipe exactly as instructed.  My family of four decided that the lime flavors are too strong and even bitter.  Next time I make this, I will cut way back on the lime zest, and add more orange juice.  Hubby said he would have liked more sauce that he could put over the rice I served alongside.  Maybe I'll add some crushed pineapple, honey and a sprinkle of toasted coconut before serving to create a sweeter version.  This recipe definetly needs some experimenting before you serve it to guests.  Nice light recipe, however; and easy to throw together.

This wasnt horrable, but it needs some tweaking. I might try adding the honey and what not as suggested by one of the other reveiwers. I let the shrimp marinade about 1 1/2 hrs longer than directed. Maybe that had something to do with the over pouring citrus flavor. When they called it citrus shrimp they werent joking!

Fab recipe! I went with the advice of another reviewer and lessened the garlic. Now that I've eaten it, I'm not convinced that was necessary. Definitely should let the shrimp sit longer in the marinade than 20 minutes. I let it go for about an hour and it easily could have gone longer.

This was very good. The citrus made it so refreshing tasting. I will make again. Next time I will try it on the grill. Thanks.

I substituted lemon for lime, but less than required for lime. Also, I wanted to use the sauce, so I added it to the frying pan to cook the garlic.

Wow, this didn't turn out well at all--it was very, very strong.  Neither my husband or I were able to eat it.  To try this recipe, I would recommend using far less garlic.

This recipe is freaking AMAZING! I love shrimp as it is and the zest from the fruit made the shrimp even better! AND it's healthy! What more could I ask for? This might be one of my new favorite recipes.

I tasted this sauce before putting it on my shrimp and I really liked it! But once it was on and cooked it tasted very bland. Good sauce but just didn't turn out right.
