I was disappointed with the flavor of the pesto.  I was hoping for a really asian taste, but it just tasted like peanuty pesto to me.  The noodles ended up kind of mushy, too.  If you do make this be careful not to add too much water to the pan when you cook them on the stove.  I love vietnamese noodles in restaurants, but this didn't even come close for me.

Good overall recipe. I would suggest cutting back on the amount of rice noodles the recipe calls for, as the pesto was barely able to cover the full pound of noodles. Was very good with additional jalpeno peppers and sauteed shrimp added.

I don't know...this recipe would need serious changes if I made it again.  Kind of bland.

I eat a lot of Vietnamese and this has all the right flavors.  I did make extra sauce to coat a bit more, but I always order extra sauce for everything!!

I just made the pesto part of this recipe.  It was quite good.  Nice and spicy--a good heat to it.
