This is delicious!!  I left out the French fried onions because I didn't have any, and used half of a regular yellow onion instead.  I mixed the chopped onion in with the mashed potatoes.  The next time I make this, I will cook the frozen vegetables before adding them to the potato mixture.          This first time, they didn't completely cook and were therefore, not soft enough for my tastes.  Perhaps I didn't  thaw them long enough.

I love this recipe.  The only thing about the recipe is I never have that much leftover potatoes.  My kids make sure there is never that much leftover.  So, I made the mashed potatoes and put together the rest of the ingredients.  I love this recipe.  You can't go wrong with mashed potatoes.

This is one of those great recipes that you can do anything with!  I didnâ€™t have cream of mushroom soup but I used cream of potato.  Also, I used string beans, fresh mushrooms and left over peas for the veggies.   My family loved it!

Made it exactly as the recipe called for, well maybe some extra potatoes and cheese and it was great. A great use for  leftover ham.

This was very good.  A great way to use up leftover ham.  I substituted green beans, and mushrooms for the peas. My family is not fond of peas. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. It was easy to make, and tasty.  It is a great starter recipe.  I will make it again, and try maybe chicken or sausage .  I like the mashed potato crust. There is not much left, so I guess it was a hit.

I made a change by mixing it all together adding 1/4 cream cheese and 3tb of mayonnaise. I used cream of broccoli soup instead of suggested one . Put cheese on top and sprinkle left over bacon on top. Family loved it. The only thing I would do next time was wait till last 20 min. To put cheese on top it was a little to done for us.
