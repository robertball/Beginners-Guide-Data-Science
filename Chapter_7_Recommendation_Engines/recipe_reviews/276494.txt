This came out delicious!! No changes necessary!! My whole family loved it, on some good brioche rolls with some coleslaw on it. My father-in-law said it was the best he's ever had!

Made using  Idaho potatoes instead of sweet potatoes and cut thick as another rater had suggested.  Pork turned out very tender.  Flavor was a little off though.  Potatoes also turned out a little too sweet and tasted just like the pork.  Too much sweet.  I will try it again and use a different BBQ sauce and maybe cook the potatoes separately, or add the sauce at a later time.  Will probably turn out better next time with a different BBQ sauce.
