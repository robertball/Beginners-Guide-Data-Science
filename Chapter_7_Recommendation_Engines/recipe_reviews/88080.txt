The actual Iskendar Kebabs are served over a bed of rice and the original recipe does not use Chicken but thin slices of mutton. Slices of meat are placed over boiled rice flavored with coriander. A layer of bread is placed on top of the meat cooked in tomatoes. The final layer is of fresh yogurt, so much so that it soaks the bread layer. Sprinkled with paprika and coriander for garnishing.

You can also try this recipe with very thinly cut beef slices or minced meat. For the best taste, real butter could be used.  Another suggestion could be to add some garlic paste to the yoghurt. The name is not coming from Alexander the Great, but from the name of the cook who invented and made this dish famous decades ago. His name was "Iskender" and he was from the city of Bursa. Cheers

As someone from the plae of the original recepie of Iskender Kebap, I liked the idea how it is twisted for making it at home. The common points with the original is the Tomato sauce, the yogurt and serving it over Pitta Bread. The original uses calf meat grilled nicely on a vertical skew also know as Doner (from the litteral meeaning of the word rotating). As the cook rotates the skew against the heat source, he or she slices the cooked meat, than the thin slices of meat is placed over warm bite size cut pitta (no spices) and served along side with thick full fat yogurt. On the table very warm tomato sauce (slightly diluted tomatoe paste and olive oil) and sizzling molten purified butter is poured over. You can immitate these thin slices of meat by taking out a block of frozen meat and cutting it thinly after letting it get slightly thaw partially, than frying the cuts on a teflon pan by adding just a little butter, salt and pepper. Iskender is best made in Bursa Turkey. Consider Turkey for your holidays a little far from US but worth visiting for gourmet.

I have lived in Turkey for several years and Iskender Kebab is great.  The why it is served in Turkey is on pide and is made with thin slices of doner which can be lamb or a mixture of lamb and beef.  It will have a tomatoes sauce on top thin melted butter poured over it all.

I tried this last night. I would agree with the previous comments, use lots of cumin for flavour. Also, I used some chopped tomatoes from a tin along with the tomato puree for extra moisture. Dont use too much yogurt. Also, I added some fresh chopped mint leaves for garnish.

I was happy to see this recipe. Actually the original Iskender Kebab was made famous by Iskender Efendi who has two of the most famous restaurants in Turkey, located in Bursa- they use toasted pita, not rice. I highly recommend anyone visiting turkey, to eat there.

altogether I thought this was pretty good. We used quite a bit of cumin and served with pitas and homemade hummus.

An interesting combination of flavours.  Needs more cumin than you may think!  My mother really loved it, and she's not a chicken fan.

Iskender is served over pita bread soaked in yogurt and tomato puree.  Doner Kebap is the dish served over rice.  Also, my favorite way of preparing this is with lamb pressed with veal, rather than chicken.

I ate alot of Iskender while living in Turkey.  They placed thinnly sliced mutton on top of pita bread and sauce.  they would then pour very hot butter on and serve with yogurt.  It was one of my favorite things to eat.

This was delicious.  I used gyro meat instead of chicken because I wanted to make it the way I remember eating it.  Will make again.
