I made this using the ingredients but baked it instead of slow cooking.  I didn't have enough time to slow cook it, otherwise I would have tried it.  For some reason I only had a half an envelope of onion mix and I don't think I'll ever put more than half when making this again.  It was excellent tasting and my husband said he doesn't want to try any others, just to continue making this one.  So, it was a hit.  Even my 1 year old ate it with her mashed potatoes.

This is a favorite at our house.  I add worcestershire sauce and hot sauce, along with lots of dried leaf oregano and freshly ground pepper.  I make mine in a bread pan and bake at 375 degs. for about 40 mins.

I am putting together a little cookbook for my sons, the oldest is graduating high school this year. This is one of the recipes that I am including in it. By the way, I love using the plastic slow cooker liners, they make for very easy cleanup! Thanks for an easy and tasty post.

Very good meatloaf.  The onion soup mix really "made" it.  It was a great way to add flavor and salt with out a lot of ingredients.  I used 3 eggs (holds it together better) and divided it into two loaves and baked them on a cooling rack (the kind you use to cool cookies on) that I placed on top of a foil covered cookie sheet.  I always bake my meatloaf like this because it allows the fat to drain onto the foil covered cookie sheet (one with sides to keep the grease in, of course).  I baked it in a 350 degree oven for about one hour.  I am very thankful for this recipe...quick and delicious!

This is a great basic meatloaf to which you can add other ingredients you like.  As to the fat that accumulates, I have always had to drain meatloaf half way through cooking in the oven.  Draining will allow the sides to brown.  I folded one large piece (18 x 24) of aluminum foil into thirds, then folded the ends to make handles.  It is not necessary to weave the foil for drainage, but the foil makes it easy to remove the meatloaf in one piece.  I used dried, diced onion instead of the soup mix, so I added 1 tsp salt.  Instead of ketchup I combined steak sauce and hickory barbecue sauce, but only used 1/4 cup.  I cooked on high for the first hour, then on low for the remainder.  My husband and I prefer firm meatloaf without lots of vegetables mixed in, and this one turned out very well.

I was excited to try meatloaf in the slow cooker, but this recipe wasn't for me.  The ketchup flavor was too strong, and it crumbled apart even though I let it rest for a while before slicing.  I might try again with my own changes.

I halved the recipe and used bbq sauce instead of ketchup.  It was very tender and had a good taste, however it was very crumbly.  The bottom also got a bit burned, but that may have been because I shortened the cooking time and had to use the high setting at the end.  Not sure I would make again in the crockpot due to crumblines, but may try in the oven.

This is my new favorite meatloaf recipe.  I like how the oatmeal blends in so you don't even realize it is there once it is cooked.  That way even picky eaters will love it!  The onion soup mix gives it a great flavor.  I topped mine with beef gravy and served with mashed potatoes.

I've often used onion soup mix in the past, but this seemed way too salty for me. I baked it in the oven at 350 for an hour.
*****************************************
Okay -- I've changed my 4 stars to a 5, because, though it's too salty for me, my sons and husband all really liked it and say it makes great sandwiches. (12 Jan)

I’d never made meatloaf before, so I was happy to see an easy-looking slow cooker recipe for it without a lot of ingredients. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because I ran into a little strangeness that I didn’t know how to deal with. I’m not very experienced in the kitchen, so I’m not sure if/where I went wrong. I sprayed the crock with non-stick cooking spray because I didn’t want to do the foil method. I used EggBeaters instead of a real egg. I didn’t have onion soup mix, so I used worcestershire instead (1 tablespoon for 1 lb). I checked it after 5 hours, and it looked a little greasy. So I tipped the crock pot & dumped out the oily part, making sure not to dump the meatloaf. Cooked it for 30 more minutes, checked it again, and cooked it for 30 more (total of 6 hours). I put a big plate over the top of the crock, turned it upside down, and the loaf came right out. It tasted good, and I’ll likely make it again. I wonder if the grease would have just absorbed if I hadn’t dumped it… I wonder if I’d want it to, of if the meatloaf was better off without it.

Well I have tried 2 other meatloaf recipes from this site and it seems the third's the charm! It's a great basic meatloaf recipe that can be jazzed up if you want but is also delicious as it is. Next time I will slip in some grated carrot for sweetness and take out the ketchup and add tomato puree instead as it's less sugary. I loved the idea of oats in the meatloaf, in fact thats what me decide to try it! So, based on the ingredients I decided to give this recipe a whirl- it wasn't until I had it sitting in my baking tray did I notice it was a slow cooker recipe. I don't have a slow cooker but it was no matter, I cooked it in the oven at 175-180C until it looked done and it was perfect.

Just like my mom's recipe, just exchange 1 cup leftover (stale) crushed croutons (any kind) for the 3/4 cup oatmeal.  I've been looking for something that had the right proportions for years and this is it!  Thanks!

The only thing I changed was to add two packets of maple & brown sugar instant oatmeal instead of the quick-cooking oats as I already had them and didn't have the oats and the meatloaf turned out great.  Cooked it for 5 hours and it was done to perfection.

My grandmother used to put sour cream in her meat loaf.  I had some left over onion dip, the kind simply made with sour cream and onion soup mix.  I used that in the recipe with all of the other ingredients as listed.  Very good.

I am a novice cook & even I made this meat loaf delicious. It was greasier that I would have liked but I think that was my fault.  Next time I'll get leaner beef. I did cook mine in the oven for 44 minutes & 44 seconds (I have a thing about numbers being the same) draining the grease as much as possible with 5:55 left.  At that point I also added extra ketchup on top & let it cook for the remaining time.  My wife loved it but my 16-year-old son, who is not a picky eater did not like it.  The 2 adults loved it the child did not.

I used a packet of taco seasoning instead of onion soup mix.  We both really liked it.  The loaf needs to sit and rest a few minutes; we ate it right out of the pot and it crumbled.  The leftovers were easy to slice.

A bit mushy but good - must be the oats.  Will make again but next time I will reduce the amount of oats and increase the ketchup or add tomato sauce instead

I used a 3 pound chub that I found in the freezer and scaled everything but the onion soup mix.  It was very moist--to the point it fell apart.  Taste was great, looks were iffy.  Kids had seconds though!

Was looking for a meatloaf recipe that used oatmeal instead of bread crumbs and also no milk.  Found this with minimal ingredients and it is so good and so very easy.  I did bake mine in the oven instead of fixing it in the crock pot and it was terrific.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I love the flavor of this meat loaf.  My mom always added the onion soup mix, so this was similar to the meatloaf I grew up with.  I really liked the consistency a lot.  Unlike so many meatloaf recipes, this one really holds its shape and slices very nicely.  Also we're not big fans of goopy sauce on top of our meatloaf and this one is nice and bare.  We had it last night and again today for lunch in sandwiches.  This is now the only meatloaf I'll make.  It's that good :)

I thought this would be a good savory onion flavor.  However, the soup mix made it too salty and on the sweet side which is not to my tastes.  It's not my thing.  I won't be making it again.

This has become my go to recipe for meatloaf!!  My hubby says its the best ever.  I do make a few changes though.  I use half hamburger and half ground pork. Instead of the ketchup, I use a combination of Bar-B-Q  sauce, A-1 and Worcestershire.  I also bake it in the oven at 350 on a sheet pan so that all sides come out crispy!

This is one of my favorite meatloaf recipes.  So easy and great for even the pickiest of eaters.  I've made it in the oven and the crockpot.  Makes great meatballs too!  Thanks for posting it!
