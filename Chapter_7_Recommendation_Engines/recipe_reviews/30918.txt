A very good starter recipe. Without adding extra spices, this comes out kind of bland. I added garlic, peppercorn and it turned out great: the meat was very tender and the veggies came out perfectly cooked as well. I'll be making this again soon.

This was great!  I made it even more special by adding the peppercorn spice packet that was packaged with the brisket I used (actually, I think it would have been very bland without it).  My brisket was only 3 lbs., so I cooked it only 3 hours.  You will know it's ready when you insert a fork, the meat comes up easily.  I used fewer ingredients (added the last 20-30 minutes of cooking):  1 onion, about 15 baby carrots, 10 new potatoes (cut in wedges), and only 1 head of cabbage.  I served it with 'Irresistible Irish Soda Bread' from this site.  The 2nd time I made this, I used a slow cooker.  Put the meat, seasoning packet on top of it, onion wedges, and poured in 1/2 cup water.  Cooked on low for 6 hours.  Took the meat out (leaving the onions and broth), added the potatoes (cut in wedges), then carrots, then cabbage, and cooked on high for 3 hours.  Perfect!  Wow, what a great Irish meal!  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is excellent.  I got a "corned beef" brisket, only difference that it came with a seasoning packet you add to the boiling water.  Follow this recipe's cooking time is key to a very tender meat!  It was cold and rainy out, I made some cornbread to go with it!  A smashing success!!!

My family actually enjoyed my yearly St. Patty's day corned beef dinner this year!  They even asked for seconds.  I'm keeping this recipe for sure.  I did make two tiny changes to this recipe - I added the seasoning packet as other users have done and I also poured a bottle of beer over the roast before adding the water to cover.  Yum, Yum, Yum!  I could eat this every week! (post note on Aug. 5, 2008 - I have made this 3 more times since March!  My family actually requests this!)

This is the best corned beef recipe!  It's so simple and good.  My husband is always ready to eat this corned beef.  I serve it with a horseradish cream sauce:  1/2 Sour cream, 1/2 mayo, 2 tablespoons horseradish sauce and 1 tablespoon dried parsley.  Combine ingredients and let flavors blend in the refrigerator.

This brings back good memories of childhood.  I cooked this the day before I was going to eat it.  When I put the meat into a storage container, I ladeled about an inch of cooking liquid into the container, to keep the meat moist, which worked beautifully.  I had a smaller piece of corned beef, so I decreased the cooking time some, and only used 1 head of cabbage.  Based on the way everything cooked I would put the potatoes under the cabbage.  Then they, too, would have that wonderful corned beef flavor.  I was feeling sort of homesick for this dinner, so I am grateful to have found the recipe.

I have been making corned beef dinners this way for years! I always use the seasoning packet that comes with the beef, use the broth over the vegetables, and sprinkle a little malt vinegar over them. A side of horseradish or mustard for dipping the meat goes well also!

Excellent, easy, one pot meal. Sour Cream on the side makes the meat taste out of this world. Boiling in a pot really makes the difference;do not try to cook in a crock pot unless you have at least 10-12 hours.

Delicious!  Reminded me of what my mom used to make when we were growing up.  My husband loved it and even my little ones gobbled it up.  I even got my pickiest child to try carrots tonight!  He loves the corned beef the most, though.  Thanks for sharing, we'll be making this again!

Wonderful!  Just as others have said - meat falls apart with the long boiling.  I did use the bottle of beer, and added the spice packet, and DID NOT rinse the meat.  The package says not to, otherwise you wash away all the seasonings.  I think that's why some people have thought it was bland.  Somehow the au jus makes the cabbage almost buttery, and too good.  18 month old daughter had thirds on meat, and also ate the cabbage, potatoes and carrots!

I don't know if was the corned beef itself or the way it was cooked, but it was not salty at all. I think that layering the cabbage and potatoes on top made a differance. Hubby loved it and had leftovers in his lunch next day. One thing I did differant was take the meat out to remove any fat on it. Then I patted about 2 tablespoons of brown sugar on top of the meat then put it in the oven (350) until the sugar bubbled. That is from my sister's recipe, then I let the meat cool before slicing it.

The  most important ingredient is missing here.  Add rutabaga (cut up like the potatoes) at the same time as you add the cabbage.  Mash them like the potatoes with butter on them.

this is THE authentic recipe that my aunt shioban has always made and it was passed down from the family...she still lives in ireland so i trust her...lol...but my family adds 3/4-1" cut carrots (always on diagonal as my aunt says they are sweeter that way...and btw, we always have bubble and squeak the next day if there are leftovers...but we donot add ham or bacon or any spices...just dice all the ingredients (including corned beef) and put in a hot cast iron pan (treated of course so no oil), let it fry up and served...i make my own mustard/horseradish sauce and there is always enough left for bubble and squeak...if not, it is simple to make...HAPPY ST. PATRICKS DAY

This is a family favorite.  I have made it several years in row for St. Patrick's day.  The only changes I make to this recipe is adding 2 tsp. each of pickling spice and ground mustard.  I also add 4-6 cloves of garlic peeled & halved with the meat and onions in the beginning.  When taking the onions out the cut up be careful!  They are filled with boiling water!

I looked this up just to refresh my memory, but had never put onions in the dinner before. Boy were they an improvement, so good! As was the dinner.

All I can say is WOW! Thought my corned beef was good before, tried this recipe because it seemed so uncomplicated - and my family can't stop talking about it. Invited more guests than I entended to, so had to cook a really big batch. Thank goodness a few couldn't make it and I had enough leftovers for more guests the next day (our 2nd St.Patricks
dinner). Now all the kids are asking, "Do we have to wait another whole year for more"? Maybe not 'cause I'm thinking of trying to brine my own beef, so we won't have to wait. DO TRY IT!!!

Yum Yum! Great comfort food - just like mom used to make. One tip: If you added the spices from the packet, you can strain the broth through a metal mesh-type strainer so you won't be getting a mouthful of those little seeds!

This was great, I boiled my beef two hours in the morning, then a hour before dinner, layer the cabbage, beef, and potatoes, and boiled for 45 more minutes, perfect.

Wow, very tasty and fairly easy. The key to this recipe is to having a large enough pot when you start.

I followed the recipe except I don't have a large pot so I just slow cooked it for 6 hours and at the last 40 minutes i added the vegetables. It came out perfect, I used the spice packet the corned beef brisket came with so I didn't have to add anything extra or alter anything, My husband absolutely loved it, I will definitely be cooking this recipe again. Thanks for posting it.

Excellent basic recipe!  I prefer more spices, in addition to the seasoning pack.  I add bay leaves, minced garlic, peppercorns, celery seed & a good dose of vinegar.  Yum!  Depending on the size of your roast, you'll need to adjust the cooking time---one size does not fit all.

I made this recipe because we are moving, and my dutch oven and crockpot are packed. The meat and veggies came out perfect. I was pleasantly suprised as to how tender the meat was. I did add a bottle of beer to the pot for some extra flavor. Will make this recipe again.

I also use the spice packet or a combination of peppercorns, garlic and pickeling spices.   My mother used to add an extra step; after the corn beef was done and cooled slightly she would brush one side with mustard, sprinkle on a little brown sugar and place under the broiler until the sugar melted and formed a thin glaze.

it is ok.... but really only b/c corned beef has such a distinctive flavor. Next time I will use some sort of brine to boil it in. I thought it needed more of something.

Yummy. I used the spice packet as well and threw in a few cut up parsnips for good measure. My mother never fed me parsnips and I found out when I was older that they're really good. I've read where people put a can of beer in with the water and brisket but I personally don't find that necessary at all. We serve this with a hot mustard recipe from the cookbook 'Applehood and Mother Pie'. It's an amazingly delicious mustard recipe with a good kick to it. Thank you for posting this recipe.

I thought this recipe was very good.  My brisket was considerably smaller, so I didn't add as many vegetables.  The corned beef was super-tender, and the vegetables were just right.

I halved this recipe, as it was just for my husband and myself, and it still made a massive amount of food.  Luckily, it tasted so good that it all got eaten up in record time anway.  I followed the directions pretty much exactly, except that I cooked the potatoes down in the broth with everything else instead of on top of the cabage.

Good recipe - will probably come back to this recipe, at some point in time - but not something I "can't wait" to try again.  I personally prefer corned beef that's been boiled for hours, then baked in a brown sugar/dijon mustard glaze - so this boiled-only version was a bit bland for me.  (I wound up adding salt to my dinner plate to perk it up a bit...)  The corned beef was surely tender - the potatoes, carrots & cabbage were all fine, too.  My partner thought the meal was good - not anything out of the ordinary, but good.  Like I said, I think this is an okay recipe - it's just not a "stellar" one.

I've been making this recipe for 35 years.  My family doesn't like the spices in the cabbage so I put the seasonings in a tea ball so we get the flavor but not the seeds in the cabbage!

Just like what my mother used to make when I was a kid. Because this is a large meal I gave a few of my friends "care packages". They gave me back my bowls at the end of the night in an attempt to have them re-filled. My other half  gave this meal an 8. Very very easy to make, but something you must start early in the day. If I was to change anything about this recipe, I would add more carrots. For those who thought this meal was a bit bland, it is the way it is supposed to taste. I have known many people who add vinegar to their plate for taste (I hate the stuff so just use a bit of simple salt). I was requested to make this again on St. Patty’s Day by one friend and asked for the recipe from another. I will defiantly make again. Thank you.

My cousins from Ireland loved it.  They were impressed that we could duplicate some of their favorite dishes even though they say it wasn't exacly like home.  But I think they were lying.  They sure scarfed it up with no leftovers.  Great post.

A great start to good recipe. I messed with it since I've made Corned Beef before.  Here's my take:
Added 1/2 a bottle of Guinness Stout to the cooking liquid.(from another reviewer)
Washed the meat (significantly reduces amt. of foam scum to skim)
Added spice packet + caraway seeds (1/2 tsp) and thyme (1 tsp, at last 1/2 hour cooking).
Suggest taste broth before adding veggies.  It may need salt.  
I removed the meat from the stock and coated with bread crumbs (another recipe) but found it didn't add anything to the dish. Won't do again.
Suggestion from mother to add butter & salt & pepper to veggies after they are cooked.

good recipe, though i seriously doubt that it was your grandma's from Ireland.  maybe Irish grandma from America.  I am first generation and we NEVER had corned beef.  that's an American thing.  Irish ate smoked (pork shoulder) butt, never corned beef.  But still, excellent recipe which pleases my dad (second generation, Chicago Irish).  Always have to make both!

Thank you so much Ann for this recipe! I have never been able to get the timing of all the components of a boiled dinner to work. Your recipe did it for me! No mushy potatoes (I used red potatoes because that’s what we like), no overdone cabbage, no soggy carrots, and the brisket was perfection! I added the spice packet that came with the corned beef and some extra caraway seeds. Divine! Thanks again.

This is almost identical to the wonderful recipe my Norwegian mother used to make.  The only difference was that she added peppercorns and a couple of whole bay leaves. This was one of my favorite childhood dishes, and I'm making it right now.

Everyone raves that this is the best boiled dinner ever!  I also like to make it with Ham. (bone in shoulder picnic style) this adds great flavor!

I'm sure this is the traditional Irish way to cook corned beef but was looking for something with much more flavour. It was moist but utterly blahh.

Oh my goodness, so so good.  We used a smaller brisket than called for, and used baby carrots. I also put the seasoning packet in the water, and put the potatoes in the water and the cabbage on top. Thanks for the amazing recipe! We won't wait for St Patty's Day to make it again!

This was easy and tasty. The vegetables could have used a bit more flavor, but still tasted nice and weren't overpowering. I will probably make this again--for St. Patrick's Day next year.

This is the way I have always cooked this dinner, it is simple and classic old time slow cooking. An added avantage is that it pretty much cooks itself although it will be the cook getting the compliments. It doesn't get any better than that.

Really delicious but gave 4 stars bc cooking time is too long.  In my area it is impossible to find a 5lb corned beef so I got one 2lb and one 3lb one.  The 2lb one was done after about 2 hours cooking time (on top of the initial boiling) and the 3lb was done after 2.5  hours cooking time (on top of initial boiling).  This is an hour difference from the way it was written.  I advise checking after an hour and a half and ever half hour subsequently.  The meat should be slice-able but soft-- def not shredded.  Also pro top- Corned beef SHRINKS.  A lot.  When figuring out how much to buy, assume it will shrink by 50%.  Yes it's a huge scam-- but a tasty one.

Very good recipe. I added a little garlic along with the rest of the ingredients, but left the rest of this recipe unaltered. A tip of the hat to traditional Irish cooking and flavor. I would like to point out that you may want to rent a backhoe, dig a fire pit, and prepare this in a caudron if you have one handy. I have a smaller kitchen and a standard sized stove, and fitting this all into my largest pot was a challenge.

You can't miss with this one.  One of my family's favorites!  To save time and make it absolutely tender and delectable, use a PRESSURE COOKER.  You can halve the time, and the fat layer scrapes right off. Fantastic.

We found it bland, even cooked in stout. I added turnips, which was the only thing that seemed to retain some of its own flavor, besides the meat. Everything came out a bit mushy, though the meat was very tender. I combined the leftovers with garlic, more onion, salt, and coconut milk (dairy allergy). Blended with the immersion blender and turned it into a tasty cream soup.

This was pretty good.  I used a three lb. corned beef brisket.  I also used baby white potatoes which were a little over done with 30 minutes.  I will probably make this again - maybe in a couple years.  Corned beef is not something we regularly eat but it was good.  Thanks for the recipe.  It is super easy and pretty tasty.  Also, I added the seasoning that comes with the meat to the water.

I halved this receipe because my corned beef was only 2.75 pounds.  It turned out ok, but it was kinda bland, needed salt and other seasonings.  The only thing was that it was kind of tough.  It didn't "fall apart" like the receipe said.  I'll try it again though.

Delicious!  I added two large onions and it was perfect.  I also used the peppercorn seasoning that came with the corned beef.  It was great (but not as great as my mom's, of course).  :D

This was fabulous!! I have never tried corned beef before - I could never stand the way that it smelled - but this was a hit for everyone in my house.  I boiled it for about 7 hours with one onion and one crushed garlic clove and the smell was amazing. Thanks!!

I have only been in America for a few months so don't know what Irish potatos are.  My mother in law had me just buy some red potatos and she is Irish and I loved this dish.  Thank you so much.

This recipe was great. I am not a big fan of really salty meats, so the corned beef was overpowering for me, I could only eat a small amount.(I didn't add any salt..it comes salty). However, the flavors of the vegetables were great. If I made it again, I would add celery stalks to it. The broth makes good gravy, too.

Will just let it cool to finish cooking, then just a good warm up tomorrow. Served with warm bread tomorrow.

Didn't use the cabbage but it was really good! Needed salt though. Kids actually tried the corned beef & liked it!

I have never made corned beef and cabbage before, but I will again!
This was fabulous.
I started cooking it on the stove for 5 hours and added the potatoes and carrots for the last 30 minutes.. Then, i put it in our slow cooker for 3-4 more. The meat was incredibly tender and the vegetables were perfect. The only changes I made were to cut off most of the fat and I added 2 cloves of garlic.

I have been cooking my corned beef this way for 52 yrs. now and it has never failed me.  I do add the seasoning packet with the brisket from the start.  The only thing I add different from this recipe is I add one tsp. of minced garlic from a jar.  If you strain your spices out of the juice in your stew pot after you take all your veggies and meat out the juice makes a wonderfully flavored dip as well as good spooned onto your potatoes.  I always boil my regular pot roasts the same way after first searing them in a little bit of oil to seal in the juices and I season it as I'm searing it with salt, pepper, powdered garlic, not garlic salt.  Cover with water and boil until the meat is tender then add your carrots and potatoes, cook until tender.  I use more whole onions in mine and leave them whole.  Then once I take my meat and veggies out I made a gravy with the juices left in the pot.

Don’t alter this recipe. It is classic and comes out perfectly every time! If you want to add flavors, like mustard or vinegar do it AFTER you have cooked everything completely as stated! I.E. you can rub meat with grain mustard after it is fully cooked and throw under broiler for minute or so to glaze...

For some reason, I find the corn beef here, in Ontario, Canada not the best.
There isnt much of a variety at the grocery stores. Often, the blood is all leaked out of the meat.
Sold at discount grocery chains.
Perhaps if I went to a butcher shop the quality would be better.
I dont know!!!! Or move to ireland!

If you buy the corned beef definitely add the seasoning packet that comes with it. I had a little extra black pepper onion and garlic powder. Also good with parsnips if you can find fresh ones! If you use seasoning packet strain the broth and put it back on meat.  Nobody wants to bite into those pickling spices!
