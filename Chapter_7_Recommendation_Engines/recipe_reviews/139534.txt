This review is not so much for the limeade as it is for the recipe itself.  Since limes vary in juiciness this recipe would have been better had it been written with an actual measurement of lime juice rather than to call for "3 limes." Until recently, for example, the limes I've been buying have been annoyingly dry.  Therefore, it's difficult to rate this recipe as being too sweet, too sour, too weak, etc., when very different amounts of lime juice could be used from reviewer to reviewer and lime to lime!  It would even be better written if it simply called for "lime juice to taste," which is what I did.

Very light and refreshing!  I used 1/2 c. bottled lime juice (no fresh limes), and followed everything else exactly.  Next time I might ramp up the lime juice or cut back the sugar/splenda -- I like mine tart! :)

I used three fairly juicy limes that yielded approx. 1/4 cup juice.  I definitely needed more limes.  My finished product tasted like watered down sugar.  I could not taste the limes at all.

Just tried this and it's delicious! I didn't have fresh limes, so I used bottled lime juice and it's still really good (and I'm picky!) I used 6 tablespoons of bottled lime juice. Also, if you want a sparkling limeade, use club soda instead of water - yum!

I agree with others in that 3 limes is very vague as to how much lime juice you actually need for the recipe.  I followed the 1/2 cup of lime juice and actually needed 5 limes to achieve this.  Served over ice, this is refreshing on a hot summer's day.

To make this alcoholic and low-carb, mix this with 1 shot of cucumber vodka and crushed fresh basil over ice for a refreshing and low carb mixed drink option. YUM!

I have been drinking the brand Simply Limeade all summer and loved it, but had worried about all the sugar I was consuming. This recipe is just as good and is low calorie!! I used 1/2 cup bottled lime juice and 1 lime. Great recipe.

I used 4.5 ounces of juice, and 16 packets of Splenda.  (I bought the Costco sized box, so it's not worth it to go buy the granulated Splenda.)  Filled up the 2 qt pitcher with water, poured it over ice.  Plastic squeeze limes of juice were on clearance for .39, so the whole thing was pretty cheap, and delicious.  For variety, add a tablespoon of cherry syrup.  Now I need to go back and get some more of those clearance limes... :)

This was a great and very refreshing drink....and perfect on measurements....I used 3 kinda plump limes which were very juicy.....as far as lime size goes.....use the bigger ......obviously smaller limes are going to leave you wishing you added more. I was a little leary about making this after the last review....but FEAR not...this is really a great  recipe and Tat2  convinced me of that.....wonderful and thanks!!

Loved this! We also tried it using 2 lemons instead of 3 limes and it was equally as delicious!

I used a large container and added 1 qt warm water to dissolve the sugar - which I used to taste, probably ended up using about 1 1/4 cups of it.  I then added 1 cup freshly squeezed lime juice and 1 more qt cold water.  Shook it up and poured into a glass full of ice cubes.  Delicious!!  The only thing I'll do differently next time is to strain the pulp out of the juice - my kids didn't like it in theirs - which I should have known because they make me buy pulp free orange juice - LOL  **  I think the directions are way too vague - the juice of 3 limes could be more or less depending on the size and juiciness of your limes.  I ended up using about 10 small limes.  I think 1 cup of juice was perfect for 2 qts of water.  It all depends on your personal taste buds how much sugar and lime juice you use.

Like another reviewer, I used between a third and a half-cup of lime juice as that's what I had on hand- mixes up fast and very refreshing!

Very good for a diabetic recipe! I can't imagine using bottled lime juice for it though. Wouldn't be the same at all.
