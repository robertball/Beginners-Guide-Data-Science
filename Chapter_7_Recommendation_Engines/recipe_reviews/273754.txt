I made this tasty chicken last night. I upped the recipe to about 8 servings so my husband and I could eat it throughout the week. He loved it and so did I! I put about a 1/4 cup more honey because I know we love sweets and it was so good! I would definitely recommend.

I have made it a few times now and the family really enjoys it.  I didn't have honey on hand so used Canadian Maple Syrup and it turned out great.

I used all the ingredients, but doubled it and added breasts.  Easy to make, but we did not like the flavor.  We slathered BBQ sauce on the leftover chicken and grilled it. Will not make this again.

I didn't have dijon so I used regular mustard with a splash of white wine vinegar.  Also we cooked them on the grill.  So yummy!   I have made honey-dijon chicken before but I think this was the best recipe yet.

Made it with 6 boneless skinless chicken breasts. No changes to the recipe and it turned out great. Would have taken a pic but the family devoured it.
