This wasn't like the dark mole i'm used to, but i should've guessed that from the amount of tomatoes. I made a half recipe, but used 3 jalapenos, and it was just way too spicy for me. After tasting the sauce before heating it, I ended up throwing half of it away in order to fix it up and allow it to fit into my food processor. After making some changes, it was awesome! I calculated what the changes would be to keep the original serving size and they would be to use half the amount of tomatoes, use only 2 jalapenos, double the amounts of walnuts, sesame seeds, raisins, and chocolate, use 3 T garlic, and add in the veg. stock to desired consistency (i probably used 1/2 of suggested amount; it will thicken a little when cooking with main entree). I also made it with chicken legs and thighs.

A big hit around here, not the same as I am used to either, but very tasty.  I had to add quite a bit of salt to bring out the flavors.  I also added some cocoa until I got the chocolatey effect that I wanted.  This is the second time I've made it.  A crowd pleaser among my crowd.

I make  mole at work also and is a lot diferent than this .I use less jalapeños,peanuts instead of walnuts and avoid the sesame seeds,add panko and more chocolate and you will see (I mean you will taste the diference) the place I work is not a 5 star but sure is one of the favorites of our guests for many years."

I have to restrict my salt and fat intake and this recipe was exactly where I needed to start to adapt it to my dietary needs. Can't go wrong with fresh roasted roma tomatoes and  jalapenos as the base for a flavorful and complex sauce.  Even with my tweaks, it was amazing.

Very nice.  Was looking for a good vegetarian mole recipe.  Added 2 dried ancho chili peppers, a dash of cinnamon, and 2 cloves.  Made a half recipe but used all 4 jalapeños.  I like it spicy.  Serve with a nice California red Zinfandel.  Yummy.

This recipe is not very tasteful...   it's rather bland, so I'm going with the more tradional and complicated one...
