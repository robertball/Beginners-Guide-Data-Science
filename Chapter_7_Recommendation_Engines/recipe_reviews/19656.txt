I got so many compliments on this when I served it.  The flavors are excellent together and it makes a lot.  Sometimes I skip the cracker and eat it by itself!  Delicious!

This is a keeper! I only had mild cheddar so I tried half a batch and it was great. Next time I will definitely go buy some extra sharp cheddar. I used my food processor to mix and toasted my pecans first. We also didnt wait for it to chill, I just scooped it into a bowl and served as a spread. For Chritmas I will probably form the logs as suggested and roll in paprika and some finely curshed parsley.

Good and flavorful!  I made this into a ball instead of logs, and rolled it in the pecans.  Added some dried chives for color.  Used Tillamook sharp cheddar cheese, and neufchatel cheese, with light mayo.  Happy New Year!

I added a few good sized splashes of worcestershire auce. The recipe is plenty to make two balls instead of one log...one to take and one to save. lol Everyone really enjoyed this.

This is my favorite party appetizer and I look forward to eating it at my Christmas party every year.  I'm salivating now just thinking about it!  I add just a little bit more mayo to make it less crumbly and make a cheese ball instead of logs.

This is a quick and easy way to please just about everyone!  I did add the nuts in the log itself and then rolled the log in the nuts too.  My daughter made this for a class Thanksgiving party and said it was gone in no time.

I love garlic!!! This is an awesome cheese log and much more economical than the garlic cheese available locally in my area.  
I did not use the pecans because I really just wanted the garlic cheese to be smooth.
Very good. Thanks so much.

We LOVE garlic but this cheese log had a strange flavor and was very dry and crumbly...won't make again.

This recipe was a great hit at my last party. It is creamy and not very hard like other cheese logs.

This turned out really good! I couldn't stop eating it. I used a little extra garlic though, because I thought it needed a little more. I made it for a get together and everyone LOVED it. Thanks for the recipe

This recipe is easy, fast, and was a hit with everyone! I added chives to mine. I gave out small logs as neighborhood gifts.

Skipped the pecans and added worchestershire sauce.   Great standard cheese "ball" recipe.  In fact, if I make this again, I'd prefer it shaped as a ball, rather than the loaf.  THANKS for the recipe!

This was a really good recipe.  Rave reviews from family.  I modified it slightly though.  I used mild cheddar instead of sharp cheddar.  I also bought pre-minced garlic and used a little of the juice as well.  I added some pepper since I used mild versus sharp cheese.  And I used fancy shredded cheese which is very finely shredded which made the molding together much easier.

I made this for Christmas Day brunch and everyone loved it.  I found it to be a little crumbly but no one else mentioned anything. I dod notice that when it got to room temperature the consistency was better. I don't think they even cared as both logs were gone before the end of the evening.  As we (I)love garlic I added 4 cloves. It is a keeper.
