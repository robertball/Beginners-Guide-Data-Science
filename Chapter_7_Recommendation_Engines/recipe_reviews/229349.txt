Great flavor and texture - it was nice to do something different than the same old green beans. Because I've tried it and liked it on asparagus, I sprinkled them with Parmesan cheese before roasting them at 425 degrees, about 18 minutes, then gave them a finish under the broiler for a couple of minutes. I'm thinking a squeeze of fresh lemon would be good too!

I thought these tasted good. I had about 1/2 - 3/4 of a lb of French haricot green beans that I had thrown in the freezer. I defrosted them and followed the recipe. I kept the olive oil the same but reduced the seasonings as I didn't have enough green beans for the full recipe. I lined a baking sheet with foil and spread out the green beans and baked them 17 minutes. They were looking a little dry to me to bake them further. They didn't have tons of flavor, on their own, so I added about a tsp of butter and low sodium soy sauce to give them a boost. I served them more as a side dish. I would make them again. It's hard to get green beans the right consistency. This high temperature method seems to be the trick.

I loved these green beans, my only complaint is that I didn't make enough of them!  I can easily see them being a healthy replacement for french fries!

Have MERCY! I could eat these things all day long! All. Day. Long. They crisp up pretty much like oven fries and they're surprisingly delicious. It's making my low carb (!@#$) diet so much easier. I love you, samanathon! I'm not even kidding. :o)

I used maybe a pound of fresh green beans just to try this recipe and I LOVED them! I have been roasting a lot of veggies lately and have never thought about the green bean.....mine looked exactely like the photo, a little crispy but tender on the inside. They were very flavorful with very few ingredients. I did use sea salt instead of kosher. Will make again. Thanks!

This is a nice little recipe I use for many different veggies.  A medley of squash is excellent and pretty.  When I do the beans I add a smidge of garlic, and sprinkle with fresh grated parmesan before serving.

Used Haricot Verts because that's what I had in hand. Next time, I would decrease salt by half because 1 tsp was too much for me. Tried as is and the recipe was 4 stars. With the addition of roasted almonds and parmesan cheese, it was amazing! Served with Summer Squash Chicken Alfredo and Dandelion Greens with a Kick.

Simple and easy recipe. I find I need to cook longer than the 20-25 minutes suggested. Forty five minutes seems to work better. Sometimes I also add onions and carrots. It is a nice combo for some variety.

Made these last night for supper and they were gone in a flash!  Easy and delicious, what more can I say.
PS:  I’ve made this using frozen green beans and they’re equally delish, can’t tell the difference ??

This a great healthy alternative to french fries, and tastes practically as good. The reason for 4 star rating was that the beans were a little soggy( tho they tasted like the soggy potato fries that I love so much so I didn't mind too much). But that was probably my fault because I brushed the green beans with a mixture of olive oil, minced garlic, sea salt, pepper, cayenne pepper, and soy sauce. After lining a baking sheet with aluminum paper, I placed the beans about 1 inch apart and cooked at 425 degrees for 20 minutes, brushing them with the mixture again half way through cooking. At the end I broiled for a few minutes. Absolutely delicious! Great recipe- will make again!

My new go to recipe for green beans. Great flavor for such a small amount of effort. I added a tablespoon of parmesan the last 5 min. Next time I'm going to try some fresh minced garlic to add some more flavor.

For us, this was just okay.The olive oil kind of over-powered the green beans.  Could have been that I added too much but I just coated them.  Will try again sometime and will revise my review if necessary.  Thanks for posting the recipe

These are AMAZING! The outside gets crispy like a fry and the inside stays juicy. I will definitely make these again. My whole family loved them.

This was a very easy recipe! I did make a couple of changes. I used coconut oil instead of olive oil , added a teaspoon of minced garlic and a couple of turns of sea salt instead of the kosher salt. Like other reviews suggested, I did put them under the broiler the last couple of minutes of cooking. They were yummy and can't wait to make again! Thanks for sharing.

Always looking for fresh veggies to roast, I came upon this simple recipe and couldn't believe I hadn't ever thought of roasting green beans! I had about 3/4 lb fresh beans and just eyeballed the measurements. Used canola oil in lieu of olive as a personal preference and also added both garlic and onion powders to taste. Served with another AR recipe, (Chicken French - Rochester, NY Style), my 5 year-old couldn't get enough of these green beans! Definitely a frequent repeat in our house!

These are delicious!  I've had all kinds of roasted veggies before, but never string beans.  I liked that it said to use the oil as needed.... I started with 2 teaspoons, and ended up not adding any more.   Make EXTRA... because they shrivel up with the evaporation of water, you'll need more per person than you would need if you were steaming them.  And everyone will want a lot!!!  Yum!

Added garlic powder and Parmesan cheese (omit the salt if you add parm) and let them get a little crispy, and they were awesome!  I also make my fresh asparagus this way.  Delicious.

I made this as written, with the exception of adding of adding grated parmesan cheese on top.
The beans were outstanding and I should have made three times the amount.

I haven't left a recipe review on Allrecipes in a long time, but we have been working hard to eat better at our house and had some fresh green beans to use up and I found this recipe. These are incredibly delicious, thank you so much for posting this!  I made them exactly per the recipe, and at the end tossed them with a tiny bit of low sodium soy sauce and a splash of lime... And then we gobbled them up like french fries!  Yum!

I prepare broccoli and cauliflower this way but never tried green beans like this. Way too easy and very tasty-the green beans were even sweeter!

My new way to eat green beans. Beats the heck outta steaming, boiling or making that casserole with mushroom soup and those crunchy onions!

Actually, I have made this a few time--kind of a green beat "go to."   Very tasty.  I do put  cherry tomatoes in it and a little cayenne pepper (we like spice).  So easy.

Great recipe, as is. It gives the beans a nice fresh change of pace flavor that makes my children love green beans; especially when they are cooked a bit longer to get them slightly browned and crispy!

We found this to be the perfect preparation for Thanksgiving or other holiday gathering.  So much lighter than the usual green bean casserole and kid-friendly too.  Very easy to make and unliked steamed green beans, it’s very difficult to overcook using this method.

These were so simple and so delicious!  They kind of got a different texture to them with baking, almost crispy I guess?  Anyway, we loved them and it was nice to have a little extra room on the stove top to cook the rest of the meal :)

Roasted Green Beans Haiku: "Well Lord have mercy, these green beans were really great. Nice change from steaming." I already had the oven going for pork chops and red potatoes, so it made sense to go ahead and roast the green beans as well. It was fun to try green beans in a different method than steaming or sauteeing, and more importantly they were easy to make and tasted good!

These are great. I plan to make them often. The sprinkling of parmesan cheese after coming out of the oven takes them over the top.

This was fantastic! I made this (following the recipe verbatim, against my instincts) for my vegetable-hating family when they came to visit, and, to my surprise, not one bean was left uneaten. I was a little suspicious at first because it's so simple, but really, follow the recipe! This cook knows what he's doin'. These green beans are crunchy, flavorful, and really make the meal (I made them with "unbelievable rolls" from this site and my own pork chop recipe), and for realz, this was a total hit! Thanks a ton, Samanathon!!

Easy delicious recipe. I used peanut oil my first time and we liked the flavor of them. For me, once I cleaned the beans dried the bowl then mixed oil, salt and pepper, and beans.  I'm a bit anal and wanted to make sure of even distribution.

Whole family loves this, kids ask for it all the time. Can substitute almost any vegetable.  Check after 15 minutes or when kitchen starts to smell great because this is very easy to burn!

I'm trying to like green things...and so calling these edible is a good thing.  But my husband loves them.  He'll make them on his own now, which is definately a thumbs up!  My friends who enjoy veggies have liked them, too.  So that gives it stars where I might not have given them otherwise.

Made these last night. My 11 year old son said these green beans were the highlight of his day!  Easy recipe. Mine took a bit longer to cook. I actually turned the oven up to 425 to speed it up but wouldn't do that again as a couple were burnt tasting I thought. Both kids loved them. I enjoyed them too.

Wonderful!  I used garlic salt & sprinkled on a bit of parmesan cheese for the last 5 minutes like a lot of the other reviewers.  It also took about 35 minutes for them to caramelize.  My new favorite way to eat beans!

I made this and added a large clove of fresh-pressed garlic to the oil, salt and pepper. It was amazing. I’m sure it would be good without the garlic, but I LOVE garlic, so I had to add it.

Have made this a few times and it's simple and tastes great!
To change it up sometimes I add 2 or 3 cloves of minced garlic and an inch or two of minced fresh ginger.
Great base recipe to make it your own!!
Next time I'm gonna try some parmesan as it sounds pretty tasty also!

These were very good - the salt makes all the difference.  I put all the green beans in a sealed bag w/olive oil and shook to coat.  Spread out on a cookie sheet covered in aluminum foil.  Sprinkled with salt and pepper before roasting in 400 degree oven for about 22 minutes or so.  Some or most had a nice char and tasted really good.  Would definitely make again.

Absolutely delicious.  I adjusted salt (less used than stated in the recipe) and added garlic.  I will roast some red potatoes with the beans next time.  A real treat!

Turned out well, which is good... Because I made a double batch. Definitely turned out better than my attempts to get similar results on the stovetop.

Super simple to make and I really liked the texture of the beans.  I used garlic salt instead of Kosher salt and added some 2-3" long chunks of a handful of scallions which added some great flavor and alternate texture.

This worked well for Thanksgiving. I lined a rimmed baking sheet with foil, put a wire cooling rack on top, and sprayed with a cooking spray. Took about 20-25 minutes in my 400º oven. I gave the beans a toss with the oil and Herbes de Provence.

I thought this was a nice change from the usual steaming of green beans. I could see throwing different spices to change up the flavors in the future. I enjoyed the nice little crunch they had in this cooking technique. Thanks!

These are my new snack food. They easily take the place of munching on chips. This time I bought 2 pounds bc a pound was gone in a flash. I covered my large cookie sheet with foil (easier cleanup) and after drying the beans shook them in a big lidded plastic bowl with the olive oil. Then I shook a good amount of Paula Deen seasoning on them and roasted them as instructed. I did stir them once and at the end turned the broil on to brown them a tad. Repeat with any other veggies you have such as squash, broccoli, carrots, red peppers. These are also great sprinkled cold in salads.

One of my favorite ways to cook green beans.  Took about 5 minutes longer,  but was super easy.   Didnt notice that the recipe states the green beans should be trimmed so I didnt do that the first time.  If they arent trimmed, the ends get tough.

Thick straight beans, left long, 2 TBL olive oil in bag, 25 turns of black pepper, maybe 1/2 tsp sea salt. 2 foil-lined trays at convection roast 400 degrees, started with 20 - 25 minutes, use less oil next time. Reheating in foil or microwave left soggy beans. 2nd time, much less beans, 1/2 tsp herbes du provence, 1 tsp olive oil, 5 turns pepper, no salt. Same time and temp.

This is awesome cause it's so easy and delicious! I got a little heavy handed with my cracked pepper, but it was still fantastic. I did have to cook it a little longer than stated...like 35 minutes. This will be a staple in my cooking routine.

I love roasted veggies. I used a mixture of olive oil and butter and sautéed garlic then tossed with the beans along with sea salt and pepper. In the last few minutes of cooking, I sprinkled with fresh grated Parmesan cheese. Awesome

i'm not sure what i was expecting but these weren't as impressive as i had hoped them to be.. i ended up squeezing some lemon over them and think they were in much need of additional seasonings.. but then again they were only supposed to be roasted green beans

Love these tasty beans. I've made them with chicken tenders and last night with a Baked Bacon Barque Chicken and these are such a great side. These are super easy to make and have provide a nice crunch that you enjoy without all the fat of fries or other salty side dishes.

I wanted to try this method since I was roasting a tenderloin. I roasted at 425 for 20 minutes. They were a little bland so I added a bit of butter, lemon juice, and garlic salt for more flavor. A nice different method for beans fresh from my back yard garden.

I followed the recipe precisely except I roasted the beans a few minutes longer, because they weren't turning brown at all.  The beans came out stringy and dough.

I have tried this several times and my family can never get enough.  I fix about 3/4 lb. of green beans the regular way and have left overs.  When I fix them this way I use 2 lbs and have no left overs.

I followed the directions exactly but added sprinkled dried dill and garlic powder before roasting. These will be added to my weekly rotation. Thanks for the recipe.

I love green beans best this way.  Growing up, I called them wrinkled beans.  We would add some butter when serving them.  I like mixing in some diced pimentos, or fire roasted peppers, at the last minute.  They've been cooked already.  The red "pretties" up the dish and adds a nice flavor.

Made these as recipe stated for an afternoon snack when my daughter got home from work.  We ate them right up and she wanted more, so there is another batch in the oven and we're going to try the parm on them the last 5 mins as some other comments have mentioned.  But, I tell you they are Great as is, just trying another way also. (after making the 2nd batch w/parm, have to say, like it better original way).

I've loved it in restaurants and was hopeful this was work. Mine were soggy, some almost burned and others undercooked. I do not have this problem with brussels sprouts or asparagus that do I this way too. 
I'll try again with fewer. Frankly, unlike the author, I had some leftover.

This method for cooking veggies has had me hooked for years.  I add a little fresh lemon and pine nuts or almonds. The cooking time does vary with the veggie you use, so I turn them after 10 minutes and judge how much more time to perfection!  Cape Cod

We started making this but I add dill to it. It adds a nice flavor otherwise I feel they are a little bland.
