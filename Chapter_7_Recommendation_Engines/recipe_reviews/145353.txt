I made two of these this morning. I used real eggs, instead of egg product, and two slices of turkey bacon for each quesadilla. Though the kids loved the idea of a quesadilla for breakfast, they were not hip on having jam mixed in with their eggs, cheese and bacon. I'll make this again but without the jam. I'm sorry--I tried.

So easy and so delicious, plus by using Egg Beaters it lightens it up a lot.  You can put just about anything in a tortilla and it's bound to taste good. I used the Southwestern flavor and light Cheddar cheese.  You could easily sub your favorite breakfast meat, but I stuck to the recipe and used ready to serve bacon.  For some reason, I just couldn't get myself to use the jelly or jam.  Instead I served this with homemade salsa and a side of light sour cream.  Perfect for breakfast with a side of fresh fruit.

I just finished trying this recipe for breakfast.  I did not have apricot jam so I used raspberry jam instead.  I also used whole eggs instead of egg product.  I beat two eggs with a tablespoon full of milk and a 1/2 cup of diced cooked ham and a handfull of shredded cheddar cheese.  I poured this into a preheated pan and scrambled.  when the eggs were done I started heating the tortillas in another skillet and placed eggs on one half, jam on the other half.  I also sprinkled a little shredded cheddar over the eggs and folded over and removed to plate and cut into 4ths.  My 2 year old and 4 year old seemed to like them.  I actually was suprised at how much I enjoyed this breakfast.  I was skeptical of jam with eggs but everything complimented each other quite well.  I will probably make again in the future.

for a more authentic version, drain 1/4 cup medium salsa put a spoonful on the eggs before folding. I tried it with pepper jelly & it was great.
