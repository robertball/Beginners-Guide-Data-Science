Fantastic recipe!  My parents-in-law are Peruvian and I'm in the process of writing my masters thesis about Peruvian food.  I'm living away from them for a little while so when I got a craving for Aji de Gallina, this filled the bill to a T!  I did change it a little bit to make it a little healthier, and I was so so so happy with the results.  I used whole wheat bread instead of white, and fat-free evaporated milk instead of the regular kind.  I had to use a little more chicken stock in the sauce because the high gluten content in the wheat bread  sucked up all the moisture so quickly.  

The result was a mere 141 calories and 4 grams of fat.  It tasted just like my father-in-law's recipe that he's been cooking for years.  So if you care about the nutrition, there you go!

I'm so happy that I found a recipe (on paper) that I'm comfortable with.

I was very happy to finally find a recipe for aji de gallina.  This was great, but an entire loaf of bread was too much--the end product was way too thick and tasted like white bread.  Next time I will try half a loaf.  I also doubled the aji for more flavor.  Edit: A few adjustments can make this recipe restaurant quality.  Making homemade chicken stock is a beautiful thing, but I usually don't have time.  I like to use rotisserie chicken (for a “pollo a la brasa” flair) and store-bought chicken broth.  Use 4-6 slices of bread (I like to use homemade whole wheat bread, and I think it contributes to the nutty flavor).  Double the parmesan cheese.  Make sure you use aji paste, not powder (find it at the Latino market).  Double, or even triple, the aji for more flavor (you can add more to individual plates when serving if some members of your family like more spice).  Also, I have successfully used almonds when I had no walnuts.  The sauce thickens a lot as it cools, so keep adding chicken broth as needed.  Last time I used 2-2 ½ cups total for the recipe.  I think the olives give the dish a wonderfully distinctive Peruvian flair, but they are an acquired taste (hence the nickname "mata gringos").  Love this dish--thanks for sharing the recipe, Emma!

MMMMMMMM!!! It could be my bias as I come from a Peruvian background... tastes just like my mom makes!  I put extra garlice, onions and make it super spicy with extra aji! I did not add olives or carrots, they compete with the delicate balance of flavours in this dish; in my opinion.

I used only a third of a loaf of bread, and a full loaf would be WAY too much. I also substituted regular black olives for kalamata, which I think would be too strong in this. Having followed the recipe this time, next time I'd just use my own chicken stock, and add cooked chicken to it, followed by the other steps. It was a long, unnecessary step for me to boil the meat and veggies to make stock, when I always keep homemade stock on-hand, anyway. You could also use canned stock. It'd be a good recipe if you have leftover chicken to use up.

Started off by boiling chicken breasts, pototoes, and eggs in separate pots.  I soaked my bread cubes in some chicken broth and then mashed it up with a fork to get a creamy consistency.  Sauteed a chopped red onion in aji amarillo paste and aji panca paste along with garlic, salt, and pepper.  Next added the shredded chicken with a little extra broth to achieve a consistency of a stew.  After simmering for a few minutes to blend the chicken with the aji amarillo and aji panca flavors, I added my bread/broth mixture along with the evaporated milk and Parmesan cheese.  Added the chopped walnuts last, and reduced to a thick stew.  I served the Aji de Gallina over boiled potatoes with a side of rice and garnished with boiled eggs, black olives, and orange pepper.  And, was even blessed to have some Inca Kola to go along with this very delicious and easy meal to cook.  Viva El Peru!

I used to have a maid that made the best Aji de Gallina EVER! and i've been looking for a recipe that was similar this is the closest I have found. It does take a lot of time but it is soooo yummy. I know she used to put OCOPE in it instead of turmeric but I wasn't able to find either. :( I would put a little less cheese and maybe a little more chicken stock to make it more like the one I used to have but it was very yummy just make sure you have time to put into it!

This recipe is great, but I left out the nuts and the kalamata olives. Nuts are too hard for a dish that's so smooth and delicious. I agree, the olives are too strong for this dish. 

Aji Panca is used traditionally, and I like to soak them in orange juice while the chicken stock's simmering and then blend them to make a paste. Also, you don't need to discard the vegetables used in the stock, you can blend them in the blender and put it in the stew as well.

Really excellent and unusual-tasting recipe.  Everyone in my family loved it, including my 4 year old son:)  

I followed the recipe exactly, except I did use legs/thighs (don't like white meat) and I added extra chili paste.  Other than that, I followed it exactly.  My compliments to the chef!

This is a great recipe! My husband is Peruvian and is very particular about his peruvian dishes. He loved it! Only used 10 slices of homestyle white bread instead of whole loaf. I also cook the bone in chicken breasts in store bought chicken stock and it was great!

Perfect if you're looking for something different.  This recipe has a really unusual flavor.  I think next time, I'll leave out the olives, though.  I'm usually an olive lover, but they just tasted strange in this.

This meal looked really good, but I was disappointed when I tried it. There really wasn't much flavor at all. I didn't use a whole loaf of bread, and used extra onions, but it still was pretty tasteless.

It was time consuming but the results were excellent. We followed the recipe except used boneless skinless chicken so added a little chicken stock mix to the water. My Peruvian boyfriend and his kids loved it.

I love trying out of the ordinary recipes, and this one was great.  I didn't have walnuts (someone munched them when I wasn't looking) and it was still great.  Added a sweet red pepper and only used 1/2 a loaf of bread as previously suggested.  As my veggie stock was lacking a bit, I added some powdered stock and put the veggies in the blender instead of throwing them out.

Are you sure 1 LOAF of bread?  I made this dish last night. It was plain, tasteless, on the sweet side and too rich. I did not like a smell of turmeric.

I'm Peruvian, and this tasted very much like the one I had back home!  I would add salt though, like a lot.  Also, it was very mild.  It could stand one more teaspoon of ají amarillo, for sure.

I also suggest yo use Don Alfonso Olives that you can buy at Whole Foods that are the original olives or buy Botija Olives. The taste of the Kalamata olives doesn't really add anything to the dish

This tastes nothing like aji de gallina. An entire loaf of bread turns the sauce into a thick dough. The turmeric turns it bright yellow and makes it taste of mustard. It tastes like slimy, sour, slightly spicy goop. I've never been so disappointed in a recipe. This was my favorite food in Peru. :(

This recipe was very long and complicated, and then it kind of tasted like nothing.  After falling in love with Aji de gallina in Peru I was really excited. But this tasted like I could have made it with cream of chicken soup in 1/100th of the time.

Good recipe, use less bread I used Aji  Seco blend from spice ace.com which worked really well.

I used sweet Thai red pepper sauce instead of chili paste and also drizzled it on top. Had no Parmesan so I added a tsp salt. I put it on top of chicken flavored couscous, sprinkled on red pepper seeds. Yummmmm!!

The  recipe was very easy to follow, but there was something kissing when it was done. I can't quite put my finger on it but I feel like it needed something. I'll try this again some other time but maybe change or add something different

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I could not find the intended pepper paste, so had to figure out a substitute.  I used about a cup of green chiles, and added chipotle pepper to taste.  I was lucky, and it came out just right!

I have been looking for the receipe for years. I was thrilled to find this receipe and couldn't wait to experiment. Emma thank you so much for sharing.  I loved it.  I cut the bread in half, added more garlic, more of the pepper paste and more broth.  It turned out rich and spicy.  Next time I will cut the turmeric in half.  BTW:  good luck finding the chili paste, I literally went to every hispanic store in our city only to find it at the local Peruvian resturant.  Thanks again. Patti Gibbons

This recipe is almost perfect.  I first had aji de gallina in Peru, as my first lunch there.  I wasn't thrilled with the country yet, as I was cold, hungry and tired.  This dish made me a fan, and, to be dramatic, may have saved the vacation.  That said, this recipe is much better with significantly more aji amarillo paste.  The amount called for is hardly noticeable in the finished product, so just add to taste (I usually end up with about 4 tbsp).  I also use only half the bread called for, and this makes for a meatier dish.
