I had to try this really bad!! Glad I did, however, my grocery store in my itty bitty town, did not have dry Udon noodles, so I opted for the premade Udon Ramen in the produce cold salad section where I found the wonton and egg roll wrappers. It was quicker to put together and I just tossed the flavor packet aside for another use later. I followed the rest of the recipe as written. I found it slightly to bitter with nutty taste. So Thankfully I had my mom tell me to add about 2-3 drops of sesame oil and about 3 TBSPs more of the chicken broth. It worked and was to our liking. It was gone in a flash with no leftovers. I will make again with the addition that I did and will make our table quite often! TY

Good simple recipe.  My daughter likes it, but her brothers don't.  I think I would like it better with the green onion added.  I didn't have any this time.  Definitely will make again.

My husband really loved this. I thought it was good too. My gr granddaughter and gr grandson, though they loved the noodle and peanut sauce, didn't like the spam.

Good baseline recipe. I used chicken instead of Spam. Used 14 oz. of rice noodles and doubled the standard sauce ingredients. Sauce turned sticky quickly, so added even more broth until it was more creamy/liquid to make it a nicer consistency. The cilantro and green onion are a must to make it more flavorful. Kids and husband approved! Added cayenne pepper to my plate. Will make again with shrimp!

I used this recipe for the sauce but I substituted chicken and two scrambled eggs for the protein. It was really good, i did however use crunchy peanut butter for texture, add a little more chicken broth to the sauce and added some seseme oil as a previous comment suggested- great tip! It was a really good simple recipe for when you're low on time but want something yummy:) I'll be making it again.
