My husband and I love this bisque! We love to try new recipes and we had a great time with this one. Of course we added Good Wine and fresh baked bread.  Had the perfect amount of spice. I thought the tarragon was a perfect complement to the taste. Thankyou for sharing.

This is excellent.  We have full bellies from it now. I loved it. The only thing I did differently was not to blend the crawfish tails.  I agree with the previous post that the tarragon really makes a difference, gives it that restaurant flair.  We are Who Dat nation livin in Chicago, missing the NOLA and this really helped satisfy a craving. Delicious, I can't wait to make it again.

I normally don't write anything about the recipes I discover here, though this is my favorite place to find recipes. I do have to write about this one. It is well worth the time it takes to make this one. 
I made a double batch just because I had over 2lbs of crawfish I needed to use. I only blended about at 1/3rd of crawfish with the tomatoes, only because I like big chunks of meat. I also did half heavy cream and half and half. I love it. It did seem to be missing something, but I can't put my finger on it. I'm going to add garlic next time to see if that is what is missing(only because I'm a big garlic fan). It still very delicious and well worth it.

Super easy and cheaper to make than lobster bisque.  It might be nice to see a healthier version but other than that, I loved this recipe.  A great way to use up all the fish stock I had!

This is a great recipe I gave it five stars. I did not puree as much crawfish is it wanted me to. I like my bisque more chunky with meat so I also added chopped shrimp also. It was wonderful!

Made it but used good wine instead of brandy per personal preference, lobster stock as that is what I had made in my freezer. and it was absolutely delicious!!! Have dearly missed things like this since moving up north, found the crawfish tails in a grocery store and wasnâ€™t sure what to do with a random crawfish craving, this was a make-again for my entire family, even my picky eight year old said so! And WILL make again! Yes it is rich, as bisque should be! Absolutely delicious! Thanks for sharing the recipe!!!
