GREAT RECIPE! Everyone loved these bars, and I would highly recommend making these! The only thing I changed was that I made 1.5 times the filling and used about 1.5 cans of crescent rolls in order to fill the pan.

This is a great recipe, especially if you aren't in the mood to spend a lot of time in the kitchen.  I had it together and in the oven in less than 10 minutes.  I doubled the recipe to fit in a 9x13 pan.  I didn't seal the top and bottom crescents together (because I forgot) yet they sealed perfectly while baking.  I will definitely make this again.

The filling is delicious. The only problem was that while the dough on the outside not only cooked, but was almost burnt, the inner dough was still raw. It might be an oven problem. I'm thinking I'll make my own crust next time and use the same filling.

OMG! These are amazing, made them last night and they were gone in seconds, everyone loved them.  Only thing wrong, there wasn't enough, next time going to double the recipe and make a 9x13 pan.  They were cooked perfectly.  I also added some skor bits to the cheesecake mixture.  Also rolled out the dough with a rolling pin and then laid it out in the pan, much easier then pressing it out in the pan, especially for the top layer. Thanks for the recipe definitely a keeper.

I thought that these were just ok, so I probably won't be making them again.
