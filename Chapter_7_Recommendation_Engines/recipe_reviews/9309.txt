This is always a hit at our house, but I soak the chestnuts in soy sauce and then roll in brown sugar instead of using white sugar. Then wrap with bacon and fasten with toothpick. This is great microwaved also (and saves time!)

Just like my mom's!  This recipe was exactly what I was looking for.  The longer you marinade the chestnuts the better, but as long as they to soak for longer than an hour you're good to go.  I also cook the bacon in the microwave for 5 minutes before wrapping the water chestnuts - it cuts down on oven time and there's never any soggy-bacon spots

This is my FAVOURITE appetizer recipe and often make them just for myself! I allow thw w/chestnuts to soak in the soy for a little while and also use brown sugar. Just a tip - to make the (streaky) bacon go further, stretch the rashers out with the back of a knife before wrapping, it also cuts down on crisping up time!!

I wasn't so sure about making this and I sure am glad I did!! What a hit this was. I did do a few things different..I used maple bacon, and I marinated the water chestnuts in soy with a little hoisin sauce.  This is a spectacular appetizer.

I made this for an open house and everyone raved about them.  Best part, they are sooo easy to make.  Depending on size of chestnuts, I cut bacon in thirds,  Also lined the bacon pan with foil to make clean up easier.

These were delicious, but I believe the cooking time is incorrect in the instructions.  I cooked for about 50 minutes at 350 degrees before the bacon was done.  An inexpensive appetizer that disappeared quickly!

These were awesome!  Very easy to make and so tasty.  I microwaved the bacon for 2 minutes to get rid of some of the grease and cut back on the baking time.  I soaked the water chestnuts in low sodium soy sauce overnight and then sprinkled with brown sugar.  After I assembled them, I drizzled some honey before baking.  Yum!  Would make these again in a heartbeat!

Very yummy!  I made a test batch before my party and wished that I had made more for myself.  They were great and I even had a few guys ask me how I made them. Most people like sugar, salt, bacon and crunch- you get it all with these appetizers!  I did do as others recommended- rolled them in brown sugar.  I personally think that the addition of brown sugar is a must.  These also can be made ahead of time.  I asembled them on cookie sheets covered with parchment paper and lightly covered them with plastic wrap- then put in the fridge for a few hours.  They cooked well- and the brown sugar soaked into the bacon.

I make this recipe with only one difference.  I use bottled Teriyaki sauce in place of shoyu and sugar.  Otherwise, just the same.

Been making these forever!  Yummmmm.  I also make them with no sugar and with chunks of Pineapple instead of the water chestnuts, or a combination of the two.

As shoyu is not sold in my area I used pure soy sauce.  Also, water chestnuts here are sold in cans that have about 20 per 5 ounces (drained weight), so I got a few spares, to say the least!  I cut the bacon in thirds, though, and a pound left me with one slice to spare.  Be that as it may, this is a fantastic and easy recipe.  The small size is especially suitable for parties, as not everyone likes a massive munchie.  Keep 'em small, folks!

Really good but not as sweet as I would have liked.  Next time I will take the advice of another reviewer and roll in brown sugar before wrapping.  Also, these were very salty.  Will use low-sodium soy sauce next time.  Definitely line the baking pan with foil!  Really helped with clean up.

I just made these...eaten one and can't wait to sit and eat them all!

I did alter as others suggested: soaked in soya sauce for 24 hours then rolled in dark brown sugar. Some bacon I precooked and some I didn't. Next time I'll NOT precook as they tend to crumble when wrapping the chestnuts.

Devine!

These were only ok. I was expecting these to be a lot better based on the reviews, but they were almost disappointing. I'll stick with bacon-wrapped scallops or liver.

THIS RECIPE IS VERY SIMILIAR TO WHAT THEY CALLED RUMANAKI'S IN GERMANY, USING CHICKEN LIVERS. I MAKE A SIMILIAR RECIPE CALLED "WALLY'S HOTBITES". I USE CHICKEN GIZZARDS. I DO MARINATE THE GIZZARDS OVERNIGHT IN SOY SAUCE AND MARINADE MIX. WHEN MY WIFE HOSTS HER RELATIVES ON CHRISTMAS EVE, THIS IS A BIG HIT.  I HAVE BEEN MAKING "WALLY"S HOTBITES" FOR 42 YEARS

Very good but I believe the original recipe called for the addition of chicken livers as well.Marinate the chestnuts with the livers Remove connective tissue from liver- use half a liver with 1/2 a chestnut & wrap with bacon- same procedure. Also i think the baking time is 'off'- just watch carefully, maybe 10-12 min.

Very good. I tried some with bacon, and some with prosciutto. I prefer the flavor of the prosciutto, but there are two things to keep in mind: firstly, since the prosciutto is cured and not raw, less cooking time is needed--15 minutes is sufficient. Secondly, the prosciutto is saltier than bacon when cooked, so you might want to counter-balance that by sprinkling some brown sugar on top of the wrapped water chestnuts before they go into the oven. Reduced-sodium soy sauce would also be a good idea. I'll definitely be trying this again!

Simply and great. Soaked the chestnut overnight and took the back of a knife and streched the bacon so the half piece to bacon wrapped twice around the chestnut.

These are so good!  The only change I made was to use brown sugar.  Thanks for sharing Eleanor!

I had prepared everything and got my husband to do the assembly.  He often helps as "sous-chef" and enjoyed doing this.  He then took all the credit, of course.  They were simple, yet super tasty.  "I'd make these again" were his words.

Great recipe!  I followed the suggested ingredients to a tee...very tasty.  I combined baking and broiling to get the bacon a little crispier, then I transferred them to an electric fondue pot to keep them warm throughout the dinner party.  Lots of compliments!

One batch was not enough for our monthly get together. I've been requested to triple the recipe for the next month - and there's only 10 of us! These were amazing. Even folks who weren't sure what they were eating loved them. Of course, if it's wrapped in bacon, ya really can't go wrong!

I  used regular soy sauce, skipped the white sugar in the marinade, and rolled the water chestnuts in brown sugar prior to wrapping in bacon. I also partially cooked the bacon between layers of paper towel in the microwave before using. Everyone loved them and the plate was emptied in record time!

These are GREAT.  I did as someone else suggested and soaked the chestnuts in low sodium soy sauce and then rolled in brown sugar.  The brown sugar makes such a nice sauce, no other sauce is needed.  Great New Years app!

Had these at a friend's party and they were so yummy I had to go looking for the recipe. Easy but can't-stop-eating-them good. (Use brown sugar instead of white and double the batch.)

Great appetizer...I used brown suger instead of white suger.  It takes a little time to wrap the bacon.  I used the small sized water chestnuts; next time I'll try the larger size.

My friend made these first for her party and I was skeptical, but they were fantastic.  I made these for a Xmas eve party and they were eaten up before I had any!  Used regular soya sauce, turned out fine.  If they are too salty for your taste, you can serve them with a bit of sweet mango salad dressing to cut the salt.  Wonderful!
