Yum! Yum! Yum! I have been looking for a while for an outstanding biscotti recipe to use as a base, and I do believe this is it! My favorite kind is Toasted Almond with Cranberries. I use about a cup of toasted, slivered almonds, and a handful of dried cranberries chopped fairly small for a sprinkle of color and tartness. I use 2t of almond extract in place of the anise extract and 1/3 cup of milk (or half and half) in place of the brandy. I leave out the anise seed. 

Overall, this is a very simple, so-far-foolproof biscotti recipe that is easily adapted for use with whatever ingredients you have on hand. I'm so thrilled to have come across it!

This biscotti is delicious!  I've made it several times even substituting almond extract
for the anise extract with terrific results.  The tops can be dipped in melted
chocolate for a special treat.  I made several batches at Christmas time and wrapped
them up as gifts for co-workers.

GREAT won't last a month.  Had to make a new batch after one week. Had to use apricot brandy for a batch and it was a bonus. I will try other brandies but fear to change what is perfect. I did set out butter and eggs to room temp. before using. Sifted flour into measuring cups and tried to not beat too much when adding dry ingredients.

These were really good but as others suggested, I upped the anise content and I would do even more the next time.  I made only a single loaf and upped the extract to just over a tsp and 2 Tbs anise seed.  I think next time I'll add another half tablespoon of seed and a few more splashes of extract.  Also used 5% cream for the liquid per Sweetooth instead of brandy and it worked great.  I am brand new to biscotti as of this recipe and if you are too MAKE SURE YOUR LOAVES ARE FLAT.  Mine was too tall, had to bake it too long (so the ends dried up)and when I went to cut, the middle still wasn't completely baked through so the tops of my cookies crumbled.  This is why I do test batches :)

I found this recipe a couple of years ago, and loved it!  As I am the only one in my family with a taste for anise, I modified this for Orange Pecan Biscotti substituting Gran Marnier for the Brandy, grated orange peel for the anise seed, orange extract for the anise extract and toasted chopped pecans for the almonds.  Delicious!  It is my family and friends' favorite.  My brother can't stop eating them once he starts!

Everything about this recipe turned out colossal.  The size of my biscotti, the size of the anise seeds I used and the flavor! Very good recipe, brings back childhood memories of Easter.  Next time will shape loaves smaller and use mortar and pestle on seeds to try to incorporate seeds more into dough. Thank you Laria!

This is the easiest and best tasting recipe I have ever tried - threw out all my other biscotti recipes.  This one is a keeper.  Family loved them - gone in 2 days - will have to double next time.  I followed the recipe exactly as posted and used convection bake on my oven.

I think these biscotti turned out just okay; however my husband LOVED them!  We made a pot of coffee after dinner tonight and he downed several of these biscotti...I ate one or two.  While the biscotti are tasty enough, to me they lack something...seems like a key ingredient is missing!  As a child, I often made Anise Biscotti with my beloved mom and the anise flavor was really intense, which I like a lot.  To me, these biscotti are flavorful but way too light on anise.  I calculated the recipe to make half the amount of servings as written (I yielded about 26 biscotti)  and doing so, I actually DOUBLED the anise extract from the ORIGINAL recipe that yields 60 biscuits (I used 3 teaspoons of anise extract).  I also used 2 full heaping tablespoons of anise seed for my dough recipe even though I halved the original recipe.   Perhaps working with the dough and the biscotti for an hour or so dulled my sense & taste for anise!  At any rate, I will definitely be making these biscotti again but I'm gonna tweak the recipe a bit.  Also, just as a mention...the dough is very wet, sticky and rather difficult to work with.  Rather than wet my hands, etc I just floured my board and my hands really well before turning out the dough & prior to shaping it.  On parchment paper that I placed over my cookie sheet, I used a long, floured carving knife to sorta mold and push the dough into 2 long and low log shapes.  Doing all of this made working with the dough much much easier.

Do not be afraid of the biscotti!  If I can make this, so can you.  I left out the anise seed (I didn't have it).  But this needed much longer to dry after cutting, so plan accordingly.

This recipe was my first attempt at biscotti.  These are the most delicious biscotti I have ever tasted.  My family raved about them and have since begged me to make them again.  The aroma while the biscotti are baking is heavenly.  They last for weeks in an air-tight container, if you hide them that long.

Very Yummy!  I made them exactly as called for---next time I will at least double the anise extract and add more anise seeds because I love that anise flavor.  I did make a cookie icing and used anise extract instead of vanilla to give it that extra anise flavor. A Keeper! Thanx

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars because as a base recipe, its amazing. I did swap out the anise extract and seeds for vanilla extract and cinnamon because I just don't like the taste of anise. And I used milk as my liquid instead of the alcohol. I kept everything else the exact same. In the future though ill toast my sliced biscotti at a higher temp (325 degrees would work best for my oven). My oven didn't want to toast anything at 300 degrees, even after 30 minutes. If anyone is hesitant to try this because of the anise (like I was), don't let it stop you. You can switch out those flavors with ones you like.

This is absolutely the very best Biscotti recipe. I made it exactly as written and I get raves. I can't keep them around and coffee shops want them. I'm going to try them with Kahlua instead of brandy to see if I get more of a coffee flavor but that's just for variety.

This is very moist and tasy biscotti, far better than the bland ones I have made before. The only thing was the brandy left a bad  after-taste which surprised me. And I used a new, good brand.  I thought the alcohol's bitter taste would cook out, but it did not. I would instead use one tablespoon brandy instead of 1/3 cup, or just leave it out altogether.  You also can cook the dough an extra 8 - 10 minutes longer the first time around and then there is no need to double bake it --it makes for a softer cookie.

I went on a biscotti binge this holiday and made 5 different biscotti: This one is definitely my favorite. I never made biscotti before and I was a bit nervous. I followed the recipe exactly and it was just the right texture and taste. My family loves it and I bagged a bunch for gifts. Thank you for this wonderful biscotti recipe!

I made these as gifts for Christmas. (I baked them fully & will wrap each individual one in Saran Wrap, then tinfoil, then I will put in a ziploc, seal it most of the way up & suck the air out with a straw before freezing, in case anyone was wondering how to store biscotti for Christmas.) I thought these were FANTASTIC and I absolutely despise licorice (which is anise flavored). These have a very mild anise flavor, BUT I didn't have anise seed. I read at cooks.com that both caraway seed and fennel seed can be subbed for anise seed, so I chose caraway because fennel seeds are huge and green. The caraway is good but not everyone is going to like it because caraway is so distinctively associated with savory goods. Fennel might've been the better sub, but hey, anyone doesn't like them can just give them right back to me. I will glaze them before I re-package them as gifts; freezing them glazed will result in a dull gloss and possibly a sticky thaw. Thanks for the recipe -- I halved it but wished I'd made the whole thing!

I have a favorite biscotti recipe that I've used for years, but wanted to try these because of the addition of brandy (I was cooking for a wedding reception and wanted a more "adult" biscotti.  These are just lovely.  I prepared a week in advance and they stayed crisp, the flavor deepened and when I opened the tin container, what an aroma!

I was pretty happy with this recipe.  It was the first time I made biscotti.  I probably would add more anise seed and maybe some more anise extract.  I really love the flavor.  I halved the amount of brandy, but next time I would feel more confident with more.

Although I hate everything anise, I made these for an elderly, estranged Italian friend of ours when I found out it is his favorite kind of cookie. My husband and son liked them very much, and I actually did not mind the anise flavor after all, maybe because it's very mild. (By the way, I used 1 tsp ground anise instead of the extract since I did not have any, and used more seeds than called for). The thing I had trouble with was the consistency which was very sticky before baking, and crumbly after. I also had to bake it way longer than stated. I've had better luck with other biscotti recipes, but this was worth making at least for the sake of those who like it.

It is a great recipe. First time i messed it up, as i melted the butter. Pls do not do that. and after mixing the flour and the wet mixture and the dry mixture i folded the dough with a spatula. That gave the thick consistency.

Just awesome!!!  Although I did change a couple of things:  doubled the anise extract and used crushed pecans.  I also only made 2 large strips but will definitely make 4 strips next time as the recipe states.  Can't wait to make them again!

Followed the recipe exactly (well maybe a bit more anise extract) and these are the best ever.

Love these. Because my husband is a diabetic, I did this recipe with 1 3/4 cup splenda and 1/4 cup sugar. Other than that, I followed exactly. Excellent! I like the idea of experimenting with the dough and ingredients too. Next time I will substitute anisette for the brandy for a more intense licorice flavor. I also copied one of the reviewers idea of standing the cut biscotti on their bottoms while they bake so there is no need to turn them. Thank you so much for sharing. Great recipe.

Delicious.  I've made this using milk instead of brandy, I've added mini chocolate chips to the dough, and I've doubled the vanilla... It's a great recipe that's held up to all these little changes and is fantastic in it's original form.

The first time I tried this the loaves were hard to cut because when the knife hit an almond, they crumbled.  Solution?  I just chop the nuts before I put them in the batter!  PERFECT!
If you like licorice, use Anisette or Ouzo instead of Brandy.

I was hungry for almond biscotti, so I TRIPLED the almonds to three cups of whole almonds, and that wasn't too much. The whole almonds slice nicely and look very appealing (to me, anyway). I used Amaretto in place of the brandy. 
TIPS:
- The loaves spread a lot during baking. My loaves ran together. (I just cut them apart as soon as they can out of the oven and it was no problem.) The slices ended up traditional size, but if you want smaller I'd suggest 6 loaves on 3 pans. The wet-fingertip loaf smoothing worked nicely.
- As the recipe states, cool completely before cutting into slices so they don't crumble.
- After the suggested time for the second baking my cookies weren't close to crisp, so I turned the oven off and left them in to dry out. They turned out just right.

This is an outstanding recipe: the first biscotti I've made that isn't so hard as to break your teeth.  Crisp, but not too hard.  

What worked really well for me was to chill the dough overnight.  Still used some flour to make the roll, but much easier to work with chilled.

Yum! I used creme d'cacao liquer, added white chocolate chips and macadamia nuts, then drizzled the baked biscotti with more white chocolate. 
One thing - I had to bake these much longer than listed in order to get a good crunch on the cookie.

I followed this recipe exactly.  Baking time and all.  Do not be tempted to add flour or bake longer.  Due to my own preference of not liking anise seed I did omit them.  Make sure your fingers are moistened in forming the dough logs.   My mother in law, an old school italian said they were perfect, just like the "old days".  Thirty years I can't count on one hand that she thought I got it right!!!!  Yummy!

This recipe was my first attempt at biscotti. Didn’t have any brandy so I used kahlua. No almonds (we are not big almond fans) but wow was this easy breezy. They plumped more than I expected so next time I will down size the loaf and make three instead of two.  Son’s latest GF said oh wow this is so way better then starbucks’. She gave them a 10 son was to into eating them so say.  Hubby said good cookies hun what made you make them into planks? I love my man. I just said easy to dip in your coffee that way hun. I will make them again and again.  Thank you Laria for a wonderful recipe and grate directions.

This biscotti recipe is delicious, and it cut very easily.  I didn't have any brandy on hand so I substituted Amaretto DiSaronno in its place, and it was divine.  I've never been a big anise fan but this recipe is delicious.

I had older Italian American women in my Parish asking for this recipe.  It is hands down the best Anise Biscotti I have made.  I used Star Anise Seed ground up instead of the Anise Seed.  I find it adds a richer flavor without the seeds that can hurt people.

These are my favorite biscotti's. Just the perfect amount of anise for my tastebuds! The first batch I made just as the directions said. I've started playing with it now and I love to dip them in chocolate!  To store then I wrapped them individualy in plastic wrap. They also freeze great!

I decided to soak the anise seeds in a 1/3 cup of grand marnier for about 20 minutes. (while I went to the store) and I also added a little amaretto. Very easy and very delicious! This one gets passed along!

Fabulous and easy recipe - I didn't use the brandy, but substituted lemon juice instead.  Also used poppy seeds instead of aniseed (cupboard was bare!) and the end result was FANTASTIC!!  Thanks so much for this crowd-pleaser!!

Sooo good! My first try at making biscotti and it is easy and delicious.  I didn't want to vary from the recipe but didn't have brandy so used Peach Schnapps - no problem.  I used a serrated bread knife that worked well - no broken cookies.  I have already decided that these will be in my holiday baking for gifts list.

These were a big hit! My girlfriends loved them, especially since I served them while still a little warm. They were perfect dipped in my steamed milk.
I made them without any brandy, but they were still delicious. I had to toast them twice as long after baking as the recipe recommends, but I will be making them again. Maybe with some drizzled chocolate as a finishing touch.

This is the only recipe on allrecipes I've come across with a complete 5-star rating - and it deserves it!  The flavor and texture of these is delicious, and it's easy to make.  I didn't have any anise seed or extract, so I substituted sambuca for the anise extract and also used 1/2 brandy/1/2 sambuca, instead of 100% brandy. The dough tastes and smells like Christmas. The recipe says to put two loafs on each cookie sheet, but if you do that, they're very small (certainly not the size illustrated).  You might want to only make 2-3 loaves total.

This biscotti recipe was great - my Italian friend said it tasted just like his Zia makes!  I used almond extract instead of anise.  I thought that it tasted a little salty - I used unsalted almonds so I'm not sure why.  Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe! This is the true Italian biscotti I have known and loved. Flavor variations on this recipe are endless. Substituting lemon juice and lemon extract for anise extract (keep or omit the brandy), zest for seeds, and 2 cups of craisins for the almonds makes a great twist for those not fond of the licorice flavor.

These are so good!! These will definitely be on my regular bakin list and will be terrific for giving as gifts! I didn't have brandy so I used orange juice and an extra 1/2 tsp vanilla. They are light, crispy, and have excellent anise flavor. I think this recipe coul be easily converted to have any favors you would want in a biscotti.

You have to bake the cookies 3 times, which makes it a little time consuming, but it's worth it for what you get. I made this just as the recipe states, and it was perfect.  I brought them to my Women's Club welcome tea, and one of the ladies was stuffing her pocketbook with them.  She called me the next day to say how wonderful they were, and how much she was enjoying them.  At first I could not find anise seeds, but a new up scale grocery store opened, and they carried them.

Excellent recipe! I did not add the anise seed. I will find some next time I make this. Definitely a keeper! I drizzled them with semi-sweet chocolate. I made them for holiday gifts. Hard to keep my hands off them. I will save a "few" for me.

This cookie is excellent!  I didn't have anise seed or oil so I filled a tablespoon with anise extract alsmost to the top until I ran out.  I topped it off with almond extract and threw that in.  Taking the advice of another reviewer I also doubled the vanilla.  The logs are really easy to work with as long as you wet your hands with cold water.  I've tried 4 other biscotti recipes from this site and have to say that this one is definitely best.  The brandy is a nice plus.  This is a keeper!

my first try making biscotti. I was determined to have almond ones, so I substituted Amaretto for the Brandy, almond extract for the anise extract and poppy seeds for anise seeds.  It was fantastic and didn't last the weekend (and then I bought anise for next time)

Wonderful! I enjoy a stronger anise flavor so I doubled the anise extract and seed. I also added half again as many almonds since that was my husband's request.

These are really good... I used almond extract instead, but next time I'll try the spices like others suggested... You dip them in coffee and they melt in your mouth... definitely a keeper...

De-lish!! I had fun with another variety..I had no brandy, I used Gran Marnier.  I love ginger so my 'wet' bowl was GM, jarred ground ginger paste and orange extract.  My add in was candied ginger, candied orange and almonds.   Easy to follow recipe directions.

Help me!  I can not stop eating these.  They are perfect!  I follow the recipe exactly and they turn out great every time.  I found the cooking times to be just right.  I wouldn't bake them any longer than recommended.   I wonder if humidity makes a big difference?   I live in a pretty dry climate.  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe.

I did like this recipe a lot. I didn't have some of the ingredients like anise flavor or the seeds (lol) but I made them anyway. I added 1/2 cup of brandy and also drizzled brandy flavor chocolate over them when they were done. There were a big hit. I think I will use this recipe as a base for other varaitions. As others mentioned, I had to bake them for 15 min on each side to get the really crunchy texture. Other than that, great recipe. Thanks so much for sharing.

I must say this is very good recipe my two year old just loved them.I cut the recipe in half i used milk in place of the brandy and it called for only 3/4 teaspoon of anise extract and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract i added 2 1/2 teaspoons of anise extract and 2 teaspoons of vanilla. They came out bland for my taste but i do love the flavor of anise and will add more the next time i make these.For anyone who wants to try and make these this is a great base recipe i suggest you give it a try. The texture of the cookie is nice and crunchy just tweak the flavoring to fit your taste. The best part about this Recipe is you can put just about anything you like into it just get creative.

Wow, delicious!!! I made these in hopes of mailing some as a gift.   Didn't have brandy or anise extract so used milk and almond extract.  They taste great! The only problems I had were being patient enough to let them cool (before cutting into sections)and not eating them before mailing some. Guess I will be making more batches soon.

These are FABULOUS and so EASY to make.  Makes are large batch too!  I used an orange liqueur since I didn't have any brandy.  I melted chocolate chips on the stovetop and then drizzled over each cookie.  SO Good!!

I did not make this recipe, but I used my mom's recipe from long ago--very similar. I screwed everything up. They fell apart when I cut them; some burned, I did not push down on them. OH my.  I advice any newcomers to biscotti to watch any of the wonderful videos on the internet. I did it too late, but I will try again!!!

I made these into Almond-Lovers' Biscotti by substituting amaretto for the brandy, almond extract for the anise extract, and ground almonds for the anise seeds.  Turned out lovely, but be warned, using sweet liqueur results in a super-sweet biscotti.  It was easy to ameliorate the sweetness problem by dipping the biscotti in extra-dark (63%) chocolate.

very easy..  These keep for about 2 weeks and I love to take them to work and leave by coffee pot to share.  You can dip in Choc. to chande the flavor a bit.  I love these and try to always have them in the house.

Excellent!  I doubled the anise extract as I didn't have anise seed.  This cookie has a great texture that isn't hard to bite.  It needs to be baked a little longer than 20 minutes after slicing.  I will make this again, but will be sure to have anise seed on hand; as, I'm sure it would be even more flavorful.

Made these for Christmas 2008.  A runaway hit and my new favorite cookie!  I can't tell you how good they were -- better than the expensive biscotti cookies at my local Venti-guzzling coffee shop! The brandy made the difference! Also, be sure to use anise oil instead of extract. Perfect tasting and easy!

This is an excellent biscotti recipe. Nice crumb, great texture! I used Kahlua, fresh hazelnuts and hazelnut extract in one recipe. Another anise seeds and Pernod (didn't have anise extract on hand) Might try orange zest with white chocolate chips in another.
Thank you for this recipe!

This is the best biscotti recipe I've tried. I add a little more anise extract.  I think the brandy really makes this recipe.. it's subtle but really rounds out the flavor.

This was absolutely outstanding!  This was my first attempt at biscotti.  It is 5 star all the way.  Since I had never made it before I was hesitant to make any changes.  I have never kept brandy on hand before and I forgot to buy some when I was out.  I had 1/3 of a cup of Jack Daniels.  I know it is an entirely different taste but these turned out perfectly.  I drizzled it with Ghiradelli bitter sweet chocolate and served to guests tongiht who ended up not only taking some biscotti home, but the recipe and some of my Anise seed to make it herself!   YUMMY!   Nothing will ever go as well with my morning coffee again.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

Thanks to the original recipe writer and all the reviewers because the whole allrecipes community helped me make knock-out biscottis for my boyfriend's dad's 62nd birthday party.  The changes I did were as follows: doubled the almonds (might do even more next time) and added them to the flour mixture. Used heavy whipping cream instead of brandy. For the anise extract I used 2 tsp and then added 1 tsp of almond extract. I didn't quite double the anise seed but I will next time.   All in all everyone loved them as am I right now with my morning coffee-Mangia!

Light & delicious..My tips make this recipe a breeze. I added dry roasted unsalted almonds. Give them a rough chop and add with the flour. I also oiled my hands a bit with olive oil to avoid the dough from sticking to me!

Excellent Biscottis
I used cream and almond extract instead of anise.  The dough will be VERY sticky. I was afraid it was too sticky, but it turned out beautiful.  Thanks!

Great recipe!  I make 1/2 a recipe in the food processor.  I process all the dry ingredients first.  Cut the butter into 1 tablespoon pieces and process til the mixture looks like breadcrumbs.  Add all the wet ingredients next (4 tsp of anise extract) and add the almonds just before the batter comes together.  Shape with wet fingers and bake for 30 mins on parchment.  Cool and slice for second bake.  13-15 mins per side.

Didn't have brandy, so I decided to go the orange and almond route. Used 1 tsp. vanilla, and 1 1/2 tsp. good almond extract instead of anise. In place of the anise seed, I had an abundance of clemintines, so I grated a tbsp. of the rind, and then used the juice in place of the brandy...Very good...

i only made half the recipe because i'm the only one that will eat them. they tasted pretty good. I didn't add the brandy because i dont have any alcohol around. I used someone else's suggestion by using heavy cream in place of it. make the log about half the size it says because they grew a lot during baking.

This recipe is easy and delicious. I did use Apple Jack in place of Brandy and I used almond extract in place of vanilla - I had run out. The previous time I had vanilla. 
Such a great flavor with the anise dipped in my coffee - near  heaven!

After trying many biscotti recipes, including my Italian mother's, this is perfection. Like many other reviewers, I upped the anise flavor by doubling the required amounts of extract and seed...not too strong a result, but a nice lingering effect after dunking them in coffee.  The texture is just right, firm but not crumbly. I don't wait for the loaves to cool, but using a pizza wheel I immediately cut the cookies, turn them on their side, return to oven at original temp for 7 minutes per side. Thanks for the best biscotti I ever made!

These biscotti are to die for.  I also tweaked the recipe and instead of adding anise and almonds I added amaretto, dried apricots and almonds. Can't do up a cookie tray without adding the Biscotti now, everyone loves them.

SO SO good. This is my go to recipe for the holidays.  I made over a dozen batches this year. There are SO many ways to alter the recipe to taste.  I did an espresso hazelnut, cranberry orange almond, almond anise chocolate chip, etc.... you can do whatever you like with them and they're always delicious. It is a great basic recioe to build off of.

This biscotti is very good.  I used 1 T. of anise seeds and left out the extract.  I also added 1.5 tsp. cinnamon.  Everyone in my family adores these.  Be aware that they do spread out quite a bit while baking.

I have to admit that I modified this recipe to more closely match what I grew up with by using both a teaspoon of anise extract and two tablespoons of anise seeds.  And then instead of cooking the dough as a log on a cookie sheet, I divided it into two,  shaped it into two smooth rectangles and THEN patted it into two greased loaf pans before the first baking.  Then I baked until light golden brown, tipped it onto a cutting board, sliced each into 1/2 inch sticks and placed on parchment lined cookie sheets for the second baking mentioned in the recipe.  Turned out just like my mother’s did.

this was really good, and I was surprised how easy it was. I adjusted the recipe to 30 servings and at that point, it called for 1 1/2 tsp of anise (2 tsp would have been perfect maybe 2 1/8) also I didn't have brandy - I substituted with Southern Comfort - its what I had on hand. but overall it was simple and they really good. I think I might do Choc chip and dip the bottoms in chocolate next time :-)

The best Biscotti recipe that you can adapt.  I was surprised it didn’t make more, but maybe mine were too big.  The second and third baking is when you can make them as crispy or soft as you like...or mix them up!  I got lazy and put a few chocolate chips on them when they came out of the oven...then smooth it over the biscotti like frosting.  I made them also without anise but used cranberry & orange with almonds.  Then drizzle almond flavored icing on them.

Perfect recipe. It’s a double batch. Found it a few years ago given  it to a few people. Just have to remember when making the logs to make them firm. 
Cut back sugar to 1 1/2 cups.

I even subbed the flour for gluten free (and left out the alcohol and anise) and they were still fabulous! I also subbed 1 c. white chocolate chips for the 1 C. of nuts.

Followed the recipe and we love it. Fantastic with Hot Chocolate and a touch of Anisette. Great medicine for cold wet winter days. Repeat as necessary.

I scaled the recipe to make just 4 cookies.  I used metric measurements and a food scale .   The only change I made was to use amaretto liqueur rather than brandy.  The cookies came out PERFECT.  Thank you for a great recipe!

Is there any chance of awarding this recipe a sixth star? I absolutely love it and the resulting biscotti are well received by members of my extended family (especially one uncle who was the first Canadian born child of Italian immigrants... he says it is a good as the ones his mother used to make). Have made it several times with only a couple of modifications (adding an additional 1/3 cup of roughly chopped nuts [pistachios], and increasing the cooking time on the second baking to 15 minutes per side). Thanks for sharing this recipe with us.

Being Christmas time, I couldn't find anise extract (went to seven stores) -- everyone was out. I had some Pernod, an anise liquor and Googled and found it is a good substitute. Just use one Tbs for every tsp of the extract. I also used high altitude adjustments. Someone here recommended toasting the seeds and I did that too. My husband and I loved it. We sampled so much, we don't have an appetite for dinner.

This recipe is perfect. ( I just used 1 1/4 c sugar instead of 2) They came out beautifully. Also, I believe one could add other items like pistachios or dried fruit and they'd taste just as amazing.  Thank you for a seriously, perfect recipe. These have that classic Italian taste- like my aunt and mom used to make!

Thank you for the awesome recipe! I reduced the amount of butter by 25% and it still came out good! Added double the amount of anise extract as I love the anise flavor. Did not have brandy, so used water instead. Followed the recipe as is for rest of the ingredients . I wanted a smaller size for the biscotti, so made smaller logs for baking (halved the recipe and made 3 logs out of it). This also helped to bake the logs evenly in the middle.

Thank you, Laria!  This is an outstanding recipe.  I make my own anise extract.  Also, I use Remy VSOP.  Lastly, I doubled (or more, accordingly) the anise seeds.  Try to buy good quality seeds as inferior seeds tend to be bitter.  I like to gently crush the seeds between my fingers to release the lovely aroma before adding to the mixture.  These cookies can burn easily so watch carefully.  Cut with a sawing motion to avoid breaking this delicious cookie!  You will want to eat every single crumb!

I divided this recipe in half and felt the dough was just a little tacky.  It took twice as long to bake and it really expanded.  The cookies were very large, but that isn't a bad thing.  Saying all this, it was an easy and very flavorful cookie.  Will make these again.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe  just did not work. After the first baking, the logs were dry and crumbly. I had to add extra flour to make it more dough-like  and it still spread too thin in the pan. I didn't even bother cutting more than one log to bake the second time. They just fell apart. The flavor was not good, despite using extra flavoring to replace the brandy called for.

Great Recipe! I love how simple it is. For us I don't put in almonds or anise seed and adjust the vanilla and brandy however I feel.

Based on the reviews and my love of anise, I was expecting this to be perfect.  Anise flavor is there, but not overwhelming.  I found these to be a bit dry and annoying to slice due to crumbling.  Can halve the recipe - 4 strips is a lot.  I made the Cranberry Pistachio Biscotti the same day - that one was by far everyone's favorite.
