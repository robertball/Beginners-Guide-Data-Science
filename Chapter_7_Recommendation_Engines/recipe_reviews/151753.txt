I'd liek to start by saying, I'm not a huge fan of fruit type pies, but my husband is so I made this for him for his birthday.  I used the apples we had on hand (gala) and a refrigerated pie crust (because I have HORRIBLE luck making anything bread or bread-like)   The filling is AMAZING!  The cream cheese base and lemon gelatin give a great texture and flavor to the filling.  I put walnuts on top because its what I had, and I loved them with it.  This could be adapted so easily to other fruits/combinations. FABULOUS recipe!

Delicious! The second time I made it I used Fuji apples instead for a little tartness and liked it much better. Also, rather than free form I rolled out the dough to a rectangle and cut the long edges into a fringe of 1/2" wide tabs, then after adding the apple slices I pulled up the tabs in a criss-cross pattern over the apple slices to make it much prettier, then sprinkle on the remaining gelatin mix and top with only around 1/8 cup almonds.
Yummy and pretty - great dessert!

I can't make regular pie dough but I can make this! Nice and flaky crust. People in my house were stealing the crust and leaving the filling!

I made this recently using a store bought pie crust for the dough. So easy and it turned out wonderfully! I am making it again this weekend.

I love apple desserts but this was horrible, the dough was so crumbly i had a hard time getting it to roll out, also when it was done the crust was mushy from the cream cheese sitting on it, i doubled the recipe because i was having company over. Thank god i tasted it before i served it! threw the entire thing away! what a waste of apples and time
