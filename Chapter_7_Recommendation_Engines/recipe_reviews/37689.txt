Great way to use leftover pork tenderloin!  I reversed the order of things since the meat was already cooked.  I sautéed the onions and green peppers (in olive oil instead of butter) and then I dumped in the tomatoes and the chopped up pork and let it simmer.  I wanted it a little more saucy to serve over pasta so I added two, 8 oz cans of tomato sauce.  Great dish!!  I realize I didn’t follow the recipe exactly so I thank you for the idea!

This was REALLY good! I omitted the green chilis and doubled the tomatoes because I'm a "saucey" kind of gal. If you plan on eatting this over rice or pasta, I suggest using double also. If you plan on eatting it plain, then just follow the recipe.

Great recipe!! I add another can of tomatoes for xtra sauce and serve over rice. Also, if I don't have peppers on hand, I sub with italian style diced tomatoes and turns out just as good.

My husband found this recipe and made it  himself for supper. Super easy and super delicious!! The only thing we would change is increase the amount of garlic. He also just add the peppers and onions in with the  tomatoes instead of cooking them separately. Our children loved it as well. Leftovers would be great in tortillas wraps, if there were any!

Excellent, easy, very flavorful.  I'm doing south beach diet and it fits the bill.  I used canola oil instead of butter and used some red and green peppers.  Served on top of whole wheat angel hair pasta.  My kids even ate it.  This would probably work well in the crock pot too.  Maybe next time I'll try it there.

This is really good but is it ever spicy!  That was even with adding more tomatoes and sauce.  One problem I had was the garlic burned really fast and although it didn't affect the overall taste, the whole dish had a really burned smell to it.  Next time, I would just add the garlic in with the sauce.  I sauteed the meat and garlic then put it all in a slow cooker.  I then put the can of domatoes with green chilies in the pan, along with another can of diced tomatoes seasoned with oregano and basil, an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce, and a little water.  I added all the other ingredients, except the green bell pepper, because I didn't have any.  Cooked it on low for 10 mins., then added it all to the slow cooker.  I slow cooked it on low for about 6 hrs. and served it over angel hair pasta.

I was looking for a recipe that would use up some leftover pork tenderloin as well as green chiles and tomatoes. This fit the bill perfectly. Came together very easily. Negative side: It is very spicy. I love extremely spicy food but it was too much.  Still very good and I will make again but reduce the black pepper significanly. I think also using sour cream would make it "cooler."

I used boneless pork chops.  I sauteed the onion and pepper in butter, removed from the pan, then fried the chops, finally adding everything back to the pan and cooking through.  We didn't think it was too spicy.  I only added 1t of salt and pepper, and the dish was plenty flavorful.

I agree with others that said this was pretty spicy with the chiles.  I added a dollop of sour cream.  Next time, I would probably use plain tomatoes and omit the chiles.  I was lazy and just browned the pork and garlic, threw in the onions and green pepper, and then added the tomatoes, seasoning, and water.

This is the best pork I've ever had...so tender!  The green chillis were a little hot for us so I omitted them the second time.  A definite keeper!

This dish was really good!  I tend to overcook pork and this meal came out so tender.  AND it was such an easy dish to make.  I cheated a little bit and cooked everything together which only made it easier to make.  My boyfriend LOVED it and finished it in about 3 bites.  I will definitely be making this again.

Both my finace and I loved this! I had to make a few adjustments to the cooking method because I don't have the deep, large skillet needed to house everything (especially since I double for leftovers): I slightly browned the pork tenderloin slices in a 400 degree oven, just until the tops started to brown (I only browned one side). In a deep wok/saucepan-type pan I added the butter and garlic, then cooked the onion and pepper until almost soft, about ten minutes. I then added the oven-browned pork slices and seasonings (some all-purpose italian from Pampered Chef, dashes of black and cayenne peppers), cooked over the medium-high heat for a few mins, then stirred in the tomatoes. I increased them by about 1/2 for extra sauce on pasta. Cooked covered on low for the 60 minutes, and loved the results! I'd like to try browning the pork in the butter one day, but it was fairly tender coming from the oven, and some of the fat cooked off too. This meal is fresh and flavorful! Thanks so much for sharing!

Way too much black pepper!  That's what made it too spicy.  I thought mild chilie tomatoes would make it less spicy as some reviewers said it was too spicy, but it was the pepper that made it that way.  So, I had to drain off the pork and tomtoes and added it to mashed potatoes to take away the "burn you lips" flavor, and the final dish was EXCELENT! Me, my husband and my 3 and 1 year old boys loved it.  If you make this, season to tast with the pepper.

I also doubled the amount of tomatoes & instead of simmering it on the stove, I used a slow cooker. Very good quick easy meal!

I had this at a Italian restaurant with my bf and it was very similar and worth making again :) This was a great recipe, I added more butter to the sauce once I mixed everything together, and didn't use any hot peppers, simply green peppers and alot of ground pepper, I fried the onions, green peppers in butter with the pork tenderloin instead of boiling. I also used 1 can crushed tomatoes and 1 can diced and it turned out amazing...

I didn't use any chilis because I didn't have any, but I'll bet the recipe is just as good with them.  I cut the tenderloin into medallions and browned them first, removed them from the pan and then sauteed the onions, peppers and garlic, and then deglazed with the tomatoes.  I put the pork back in the pan, covered and simmered for 20 min.  the result was really good.  The pork was very tender and the sauce was a really nice compliment.  Next time I will cut the pork into strips for asthetic purposes.  The strips of pork will go better with the pepper slices than the medallions.

WOW, was this spicy!  I used 1 tsp. of pepper and 1 tsp. salt, and I think next time I would only use 1/2 tsp. pepper. But, it was very, very tasty and healthy, so I'll use this recipe again for sure, with some modifications.

Very good.  The only change was that, as others, I didn't find it necessary to boil the pepper and onion - I briefly sauted them in the skillet, then removed them and added the butter and garlic, then browned the meat and followed the recipe from there. Served it over rice - terrific!...Thanks, Justin.

Way too hot for me, even with mild Rotel tomatoes. Whatever flavor there was, it was just overpowered by the heat.

This is good comfort food.  I fixed it in the crockpot also - just browned the pork first.  When I fix it again, though, I will leave time to thicken the sauce.  There were plenty of vegetables in it, so I just served it up with lots of mashed potatoes.

I tripled this to take to a potluck and came home with an empty roaster and requests for the recipe.  I did make changes, though.  I used pork stew meat, which I browned and put in a roaster.  I then sauteed the vegetables in the same pan and added them to the meat.  I finished off the dish in the oven.  Oh, and I did not use that much black pepper!  Good recipe!

Smaller pork pieces, all browned atthe same time cut the cooking time down to 20 minutes, also I added the chopped onion and green pepper right into the pan rather than boiling them seperately - that made this meal delicious and fast. I served it with nugget potato halves boiled then fried in butter - a yummy combination and a nice change from the typical rice side

I cut the tenderloin into medallions instead of strips and browned them while sautéing the onion and the garlic at the same time (instead of boiling). I used fresh tomatoes and basil as well as a zucchini and omitted the chilies (I’m cooking for a toddler too), added a quarter cup of chicken broth to the pan and left it to simmer for 20 minutes. Served over rice, turned out tender and delicious.

Made it for a potluck and it was a hit! I halved the amount of pepper (like the other reviewers suggested). I still thought it was a little too spicy but when mixed well with plain rice, it lessened the burn.

Love it, love it, love it!! Comes out tender and flavorful everytime. I omit the green peppers b/c I just dont like em, thinking about trying yellow peppers instead, their a little milder and they will add some color. I recommend buying the chilies seperately from the diced tomatoes, so you can play with the flavor. Also, use the unsalted diced tomatoes, so that you can play with the salt content as well. Horseradish mashed potatoes compliment the pork very well or even spanish rice.

Very good. I didn't cook it as directed but instead made it like a stir fry, browned the garlic and meat together then added the onions and peppers and finally adding in the rest of the ingredients.  I used a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes and a 4 oz can of chopped chilies.  Served over rice, husband raved about how tender the tenderloin was and it was not too spicy for us at all. Excellent recipe I will be repeating.
