Easy and yummy. I had some chicken breasts that I needed to cook. I cut them in 3rds, used Grill Mates sweet and savory rub. I didn’t BBQ because of snow conditions. Baked at 375 for 30 mins on a baking sheet (wrapped w/foil) with a rack. I did baste with the honey/water glaze. Served with BBQ sauce.

Super simple and perfect way to get my 4 and 7 yr old to eat  up their protein. My oldest asked for 2nds which happens.... Ahhh never! I sliced up some chicken breast cuz that's what I hand. Didn't use BBQ seasoning (didn't have) Came out wonderful. For a bit of fun serve with honey mustard.

It was good.  I baked it instead of grilling it.  I was hard to get the bacon crisp enough.  I broiled it once the chicken was cooked, it crisped up nicely.
