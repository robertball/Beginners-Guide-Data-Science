This salad is freaking IN-sane. I had to hurry up and cover the leftovers as I almost ate the whole darn bowl on my own. Uh, YUM.

Nice summer salad. Light and would go well with so many entrees. I used the fresh wet mozzarella cheese and used my judgement for the amount and used more fresh basil again using my judgement because I love fresh basil. I like to use white balsamic vinegar because it does not discolor lighter colored ingredients and also added some wrinkled black olives which I thought went well. This would be great as an appetizer with sliced grilled bread. (recipe made for *RECIPE GROUP*)

Recipe Group selection 7/28/12.  This so easy to put together and so tasty.  I had some bocconcini (fresh mozzarella balls) to use up so I used them in place of the cubes of cheese.  Everything else was exactly to the recipe.  This made a delicious lunch with some crusty bread.  Thanks Cajun Girl, this is a winner we will enjoy again!

Made this for Recipe Group...YUM! Tomato salads are a summer staple in our family, so reading the ingredients I knew this would be a hit! I used grape tomatoes and white basalmic vinegar (my new favorite, lol). This had such a light, fresh taste and went great w/ dinner! We usually make ours right before serving, but I liked that this was chilled for a while to allow the flavors to develope...DELICIOUS! Thanks for sharing. :)

I actually made this in to a pasta salad by adding some cooked orzo.  It was awesome!  I adjusted the vinegar and oil to my preference (less oil more vinegar) and it was great.  Thanks

Recipe Group Selection:  28, July 2012  Wonderful blend of flavors.  I used fresh tomatoes from our garden and liquid-packed fresh mozzarella.  Great summer recipe, it was enjoyed by all my family.

Exactly what you get in a restaurant but at home.  I used as a topping for pasta, could also use on a spinach salad as a side.

Excellent salad.  I did change it a bit though.  I made the dressing as a basil pesto.  Anchovies were substituted for salt and I added a little lemon juice as well.  The dressing was then drizzled over the salad.  It was a great hit,

This recipe is almost exactly like what I make but I add thinly sliced red onions.  My husband and I both love raw red onions.  Makes for a good addition to the salad!  One of my favorite salads ever! Enjoy!

I used the tiny mozzarellas. I think they taste better. Also used very best oil & balsamic.

I have made this same exact recipe for years. We love it! I use fresh large cherry tomatoes cut in half or quartered from the garden.
My husband loves it for lunch with some salami and French bread, here at the ranch.

Second time I've made this recipe. Both times I substituted asiago cheese for the mozzarella. Asiago is a much bolder more flavor!

Yes, I used about 3!TBSP of basaltic, rather than the 1 1/2.  I liked it better.

I simply love this recipe, I have always loved mozzarella cheese and I think that this set of flavours is absolutely perfect. My mum used to make her own version and I took over with the cooking. I thought this was French because I am French but I never knew it would be on American websites.

Will make this again. Hopefully I can keep my basil growing indoors this winter. I used my dehydrated cherry tomatoes, soaking them in the vinegar and oil for a while first.

Not my favorite recipe.  I used tomatoes and fresh basil from my garden.  Very bland.
