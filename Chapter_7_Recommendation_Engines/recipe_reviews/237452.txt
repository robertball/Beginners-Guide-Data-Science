The one thing that I like about this recipe is that it's scaled down to 1 serving.  No need to have a bottle of Heinz 57 Sauce sitting in the cabinet, just mix up what you need that day, and it's done.  Honestly, I haven't bought Heinz 57 Sauce in years, so I'm not 100% sure how close this is to it. But I will say that we liked this sauce, and we did like the Tabasco in it as well.

All I can say is WOW! I loved it, but it was not near enough. I came up with my own larger recipe. 
My carb count was different, but I believe it was my use of Heinz low carb ketchup  that made the difference. 
1 13oz bottle of Heinz no added sugar ketchup 
1/2 cup of worcestershire sauce
1/4 cup of yellow mustard
3 tbls of lemon juice 
2 tbls of Texas Pete
This gave me a yield of 20.58oz, with a total of 52 grams of carbs.
With a serving size of 2 tbls, the total carbs per serving is 1.6 grams.
I mixed everything up in a 4 cup measuring cup, and poured it into an empty ketchup bottle.
Hope this helps those who want a little bit more...

BINGO! You nailed it.  I love Heinz 57 with my fried taters.  But when I went to pick up another bottle, I found the price had increased to $5.65 for a 20oz. bottle!  Yikes!  What on earth could they put in it that justifies that price??? I decided to find out if anyone had cracked the code, and found your recipe.  Now I am abundant in my favorite tater sauce at a fraction of the cost.  You're a genius - thanks for sharing.

I made it. However, I did not find it to taste much like Heinz 57.  It did taste like most steak sauces.  Where as Heinz 57 I actually like on grilled chicken.  I'm not sure about this sauce.  As far as going on steak,  I'm not sure what kind of steak  everyone else eats, but a steak doesn't need sauce.  So, yes its great if you like steak sauce. (crazy) but not Heinz sauce.

You've created the perfect copycat recipe, NWMama. Thank you for sharing it. I have made this several times now and it's perfect as-is. Just FYI, the brand of worchestershire sauce you choose does make a difference. My last batch was with the store brand and it tasted off. I won't do that again.

I was looking for a Heinz 57 copycat because I can't eat the original anymore now that I'm watching my sugar & corn syrup intake. This tasted like the original to me, just without all the sweet junk.

VERY GOOD!  I tasted this sauce after mixing and I honestly can say I thought it was going to be a loser.  I refrigerated it until dinner giving the ingredients time to blend.  When served with a steak it was excellent!  It truly can compete with any store bought steak sauce.  Thank you NWMama for sharing your recipe.  I will be making it again!

I will never again pay for a bottle of Heinz 57 sauce!  I think this sauce is actually better than the original and VERY inexpensive to make.

Delicious!  I didn't have lemon juice, but it came out wonderful, even without it.  I love this sauce for making my favorite meatloaf.  Easy to mix and so much cheaper than the actual stuff in the store.  Even the store brand is overpriced.  Thank you for this recipe!

made this for the old man and he tasted a slight difference but still loved it, even said it was better since I added a couple extra drops of Tabasco in it.

Wow, This recipe is spot on!   The taste and fact that I had everything in the frig makes this a 5* recipe.  I just used the whole serving with my steak. I will  buy the bottled stuff again. Thanks NWMama, you did good!.

An excellent recipe.  I like the fact I can make a single serving or easily double or tripe the recipe. The flavor is wonderful. I stopped buying the original due to some of the ingredients, but this is so easy and tasty with only 5 ingredients.

This was spot on! I followed the recipe exactly and it has all of the tanginess and spice of the Original 57 sauce. After a few tastes, I added a pinch---just a teeeeeny pinch of sugar and it suited my palate. The amount was enough for about 2-3 burgers. Great job!

Great taste alike.

This tastes just like the real thing and I whipped it up in about 2 minutes.

Multiplied times 4 four two people as we really like steak sauce and this makes a very small amount.

It's okay. It certainly looks like 57 sauce.  Didn't quite taste like it. But then it's hard to measure half a teaspoon of mustard so maybe I didn't make it exactly right.  And maybe I added 3 drops of Texas Pete instead of 1 drop of Tobasco.  Oh well.  I'll have to try that larger recipe by BBQ Bob.

Ran out of Heinz 57 for our burgers and I didn't feel like driving back to the store. I found this recipe online so I decided to give it a try. My oldest son and husband were skeptical but when they tasted it, they were pleasently surprised and I was happy not having to run back to the store.  Great recipe, THANK YOU!
