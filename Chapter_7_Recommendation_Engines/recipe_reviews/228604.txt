Made this exactly to the instruction, using mirin instead of sake and sugar.  Salty, spice and horrible!  I should have realized a cup of soy sauce was probably way too much.

Excellent. As written in the notes, I used Mirin instead of sake. I also left out the corn starch as I wanted a liquid sauce. Thank you for the recipe.

My family loved this! I didn't have the marmalade so I used fresh squeezed orange juice and it absolutely delicious!
