This is by far the strangest cookie I have ever made. It has almost a cake-like texture; VERY soft and fluffy and the flavor of the nutmeg comes out beautifully (I also added a teaspoon of vanilla extract) with a perfect hint of sweet potato goodness. Fresh out of the oven it didn't seem to have too much flavor although the texture was lovely. I waited for it to set for a while and about four hours later it was perfect. I've eaten five already and made a batch of thirty. By their quality I'd say they'll be gone the second my apartmentmates wake up tomorrow; _ Unexpectedly excellent recipe: Bravo!

These cookies are absolutely delicious - very light and extremely moist. I am a health nut so I tweaked the recipe a little bit - I used 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup canola oil in place of the butter. I also added 1 teasp. of vanilla extract. And I ended up baking the cookies for about 10 minutes. I would definitely make this recipe again - the lemon zest added a nice kick. I baked them last night left them overnight to cool and tried them this morning - absolutely delicious and healthier than many other cookie recipes!

What an unexpected treat. I tried this recipe for fun but it is really good. I used a bit more sugar than the recipe and added vanilla (1 tsp. They have a wonderful texture. I made the first batch plain and added a simple glaze on top. The second batch I pushed a mini marchmallow in the middle and topped with a bit of brown sugar like a mini sweet potato casserole. They looked really cute and were a great thanksgiving warm up.

These are tasty but they definitely taste like healthy cookies. To boost this flavor use whole wheat flour. The consistency is somewhere between a cake-like cookie and a scone. They do not expand much while baking are are a breeze to get off the pan. I baked them for 9 minutes. One lemon will give roughly enough zest for a double recipe. I also added some cinnamon to the recipe.

These cookies were wonderful. Moist and refreshingly different and healthy. I agree with the other reviews that they are more of a biscuit consistency. I dipped the tops in colored sugar so that they would appeal to my toddler who initially said no to the sweet potato. She loves them. I also subbed 1/2 cup wheat germ and 1/2 whole wheat flour. They were still delicious.

These cookies came out more like baking powder biscuits! Not at all like a typical cookie. They had pretty good flavor the next day. I followed the recipe exactly and then added about 1/2 cup of shredded zucchini. I made one sheet and decided to use the rest of the dough for biscuits. They are very pretty with specks of orange and green and they are not too sweet so they'll go well with a ham dinner. Not what I expected but interesting just the same. Also my 2 year old likes them even though there are veggies in them!! Thank you!

I had peeled one too many sweet potatoes while making dinner tonight so I looked up a recipe that I'd be able to use up my extra sweet potato. This recipe fit the bill perfectly! These cookies are sooo good! But what really took them over the top was when I realized that I had some leftover lemon cream cheese icing from my son's birthday cake the other day. I put a small smear of icing on each cookie.... AWESOME!!!

Thanks to the reviews for giving good feedback on these cookies. That helped me know what I would get and how I might want to tweak the recipe as I went along. The reviewers said it was like a biscuit so I cut back to 1 tsp of baking powder and increased to 2 eggs. That made the cookies more like little puffy cakes. I like the glaze idea also but they are also good without glaze. Next time I will roll the ball of batter before spooning it onto the baking pan to get a rounder finished shape in the cookie. I would also try them with already-baked and sweetened chunks of sweet potato in the batter in place of or in addition to the shreds of raw sweet potato. Overall I great cookie!

I made these cookies using Japanese sweet potato (satsumaimo) and they turned out very well. Was a bit worried when I started to mix everything together (seemed like way too much flour) but they ended up fine. Nice delicate flavour (after reading other reviews I added 1/2 tsp vanilla). Turned out like little scone-cookies. My husband took them to work where they were apparently gobbled up by his Japanese co-workers. Would definately make again perhaps experiment more with different flavour additions.

Glad I read the reviews first! I mixed in about a tablespoon of water after the final mix and ours turned out delicious & moist. I'm so glad to have found a cookie with so little sweetener. Wonderful!

Amazing cookie! Definitely gonna make again!!! Delicious and comforting flavors!!!!! Mostly followed instructions except as follows: used butter flavored shortening instead of butter (had none) added ginger cinnamon coriander and vanilla along with the nutmeg that was called for; didn't have honey so doubled the amount of white sugar and didn't have lemon so used lime zest. After making them into balls I rolled them in sugar and lightly flattened with a fork. Couldn't taste the lime in the finished product (thankfully that may have been weird) but used it in the recipe anyway because I knew some sort of citrus zest would "brighten" up the other flavors. Oh and mixed in 1 1/2 cup of raisins and chopped prunes that I needed to use. I know the prunes may sound gross but I chopped them so tiny and had more raisins than prunes so they blended in nicely wont tell my kids and they never guessed! Next time will try to make over the recipe using healthier alternatives like splenda applesauce egg whites and want to add pecans or walnuts. Very happy to have found this recipe thanks for posting it! Oh and it may not be important but I didn't even use the same sweet potato they used... I had frozen leftover sweet potato casserole from thanksgiving! I thawed it in the microwave and substituted it for the raw grated sweet potato. I bet canned pumpkin would work well too. What a hoot! Fabulous and yummy!

My son's literature class is reading a novel that takes place in Africa and he had to bring something made with yams for a presentation. We wanted to do something different so made these cookies but with yams instead of sweet potatoes. These were a huge hit!! My son asked to make another batch for home- they were very moist! We did make a few minor changes: we added 3 T of splenda brown sugar sub. as well as 1 t. of vanilla 1 t. of cinnamon and increased the lemon zest to 2 t. We made them bigger yielding 24 cookies instead of 36 so baked them at 325 for about 10 minutes. When they were done we topped each with a small dollop of lemon cream cheese frosting as another poster suggested. Either the kids all loved them because they really were very good or they were just so relieved not to see another whipped yam and marshmallow casserole-I'm not sure which!

I just recently discovered my love for sweet potato and so I've been trying to incorporate it into everything so I was really excited when I found this recipe! I made a ton of really random changes though but they still turned out really good. I added about a teaspoon or two of orange juice into the honey mixture along with vanilla extract as everyone else has said but I think it might need some more. I didn't have lemon zest so I left it out but next time I think i will try adding orange zest. Also i replaced hald of the butter with unsweetened applesauce to make it healthier and I also added 2 T of splenda brown sugar (which is equivalent to 1/4 cup) and i think it might need more however I am going to try to mak ea brownsugar glaze so maybe they will make it sweet enough. they turned out like sconish biscuits as everyone else has said and i couldn't really taste the sweet potato but they are still really good! will make these again and i might try adding the marshmallow and brownsugar on top because that sounded really cute!

these are really nteresting cookies. if not your cup of tea they are certainly concersation starters. they're like little tasty scones. in my second batch I added one tablespoon of apple cider then rolled them in "sugar in the raw and vanilla sugar". they were a bit more moist and sweet this way. serve with apple cinnamon tea! p.s. an extra star for being interesting but this recipe took me a long time to complete (perhaps because I grated the potato and lemon peel by hand). the cooking time was also 3x longer than noted in the recipe... I'm at a high altitude but it should not have increased the time so much.

I made this recipe for my cooking club as the theme was Cookies and I wanted something semi-healthy. I made with all organic ingredients replaced all purpose flour with all whole wheat flour added a little more honey added cinnamon used vegan butter in place of regular butter added 1/2c to 3/4 c zucchini and 1/2 bag of chocolate chips. I baked on stoneware so it took about 15mins. They were a little cakey but they were a hit!!

While not the sweetest of cookies I thought they were good. Based on reviews this recipe needs tweaking depending on your tastes. Mine...I added 1 tspn vanilla and 1 tspn cinnamon used equal parts baking powder and soda (1/2 tspn ea.) used brown instead of white sugar. Lastly I cooked them a bit longer than the called for 7 min. These do not flatten so I flattened the balls just a hair after placing on the baking sheet (USE PARCHMENT PAPER) and sprinkled with granulated sugar when I look them out of the over.

This was a very interesting cookie but very yummy! I replaced the lemon zest with cinnamon and it turned out great! A little more butter though is all I would recommend as it turned out slightly dry. It was pretty easy to make and quick too. Loved it!

Pretty good. I rolled them into balls and pressed down with a fork like a peanut butter cookie. The lemon flavor was nice. Not an astounding cookie but a decent healthy alternative to most recipes.

I didn't have a lemon so I substituted finely chopped candied ginger and reduced the fat by using half margarine and half applesauce for the butter. To make them more appealing to my son I also topped them with a mini marshmallow and a sliver of candied ginger before baking. These did as previous cooks commented come out like mini scones. They were very good!

I just wanted to make some cookies instead of buying some. I juiced some veggies for my son and thought it might be good in a cookie recipe so I found this one. The only thing I added was blended apples and carrots to the sweet potato to make up the cup needed because that's what I had. I also added some of the left over lemon rimes to the top of some of the cookies. They came out very soft. Almost like a soft biscuit. I cooked them a few minutes longer for a little crunch on the bottom.I Love them!!

I don't make cookies very often. The last time must have been years ago. But I wanted to make something to hand out for Halloween and I also wanted something that was low in calories. I followed the recipe exactly as was written. There seemed to be too much dry ingredients because the batter never really came together. It doesn't say to flatten the balls of cookie dough so I just put them in the oven for 7 minutes and they came out undercooked. So I flattened them then and left them in for another few minutes. Frankly they were tasteless apart from a slight taste of lemon. The sweet potato taste was completely lost and they were pretty dry.

Substitute 1 cup Brown sugar for sugar. Add 1 ts vanilla add 1 ts cinnamon.
