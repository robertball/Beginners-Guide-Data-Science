Best icing I have ever tasted! My husband ate the leftover icing like pudding. I used Low Fat Cool Whip, Low Fat milk, and sugar free pudding and it was so yummy without all the calories! From now on, this will be the only icing we eat. No more of the store bought stuff.

Beautiful light texture with a deeply creamy taste. It was also thick enough to easily use between layers in a layer cake. I will most certainly use this again, especially as it will be very easy to vary the flavor (by just changing the pudding) to match any kind of cake.   NOTE: For a 9" layer cake (4 layers with frosting between each layer and around the entire outside of the cake), I doubled the recipe EXCEPT for the cool whip (kept that to 1 container). It turned out perfectly.

This was great and easy! I really dislike overly sweet frostings, so this was perfect. I did have some problems getting it to spread well, but that might have been a timing issue. I had to make the frosting before the cake was completely cooled, so it sat in the fridge for a while before I frosted the cake.

Wonderful when you like a cold cake, which I do, and VERY EASY.  Tastes better than canned for sure.  Must keep in Refrigerator.

Loved this and got rave reviews, even from people who are not big "cake" eaters.  Used vanilla pudding and frosted a layered "poke" cake with sliced strawberries between the layers.  This was a perfect frosting for those times when you don't want an overly heavy and sweet frosting.  My son dipped strawberries in the extra frosting, so this made a yummy fruit dip too...

This is a wonderful frosting recipe, I used it with a 2 layer chocolate dirt worm cake and it help the crushed oreos and gummy worms fine.  After I frosted and decorated the cake I kept it in the fridge until close to party time and it was perfect.  I will definitely use it again, it's a nice light change from buttercream.

this was NOT the texture of frosting AT ALL.  It was tasty, and I kind of dumped some on top of our cake, but it's not frosting.  I would be a really good filling for a layer cake, but stick with real icing or frosting for the top of the cake.  I don't know why I thought these ingredients would make up a frosting texture, so it's kind of my own fault!!

I made this for my daughter's birthday cake, and I used white chocolate cheesecake flavored jello and added food coloring to make it pink for her.  It was so easy, and so yummy!  I love that you can use different pudding flavors to complement whatever you are frosting.

Lovely. I used sugar free cheesecake pudding and frosted a red velvet cake with it. It was the perfect amount to frost and fill a 3 layer cake with ease, and with the light, just-sweet-enough frosting there weren't big blobs of it left uneaten on my family's plates like there often is with store bought frosting.

This just didn't really work out.  The flavor was decent but the texture was off.  It was gritty and didn't set up well enough to really frost the cupcakes I made.

Tastes like jello instant pudding and cool whip - nothing wrong with that, if you're in the mood.  I piped it onto cupcakes - it piped ok, but wasn't really stiff enough to let sit out for long.  If I was in a hurry, I'd just whip a can of store-bought frosting.  Just as junk-foody, but easier to use.

Delightful! Super light and fluffy. I used this to frost my chocolate cookie dough cupcakes from this site and it was the perfect compliment. I even swiped a few dabs right out of the bowl!

It really wasn't as good as I expected.  Once it was done, it tasted more like store bought then homemade.  I'm really looking for a good milk chocolate frosting.

Needed a quick recipe for cake/icing for children's church since I forgot to get cupcakes.  The kids loved this icing.  Some of them just ate the icing and left the cake.

This icing is delicious. You will be tempted to eat it without cake.  It is also truly easy.  I put it in an icing bag and piped it, for beautiful professional looking cupcakes.  I wish I had thought to take a picture.  They looked like the cupcakes you'd buy in a store, and it was unbelievably easy. Everyone loved them, even people who usually skip the icing.  I would have liked to bump off half a point though.  My beautiful swirls lost some of their intergrity,  pudding certainly tastes better than crisco, but it will not hold up as well.  When the cupcake were served the icing had begun to sag, just a little.  (Really, less than you are picturing.  I only mention it in the interest of full disclosure.  What do you expect from a mix of pudding and whipped cream?)

I used to make this recipe years ago but I lost the recipe.  I make cup cakes in ice cream cones and use this frosting as the swirled ice cream.  Kids absolutely love it!

I made this with vanilla pudding to go with the gelatin poke cake from this site.  Not too heavy or sweet, just light and refreshing.

I felt this recipe wasn't very thorough. It doesn't specify as to if you should make the pudding like a *pie filling* or make it like *pudding* one tends to be runnier then the other....and we really can't afford the mistake!!! Other than that, I have yet to try this recipe tomarrow for my cupcakes...But I am making the frosting with vanilla pudding, and adding a teeny vanilla extract. Will update on success. Please mention what measurements equal to 1 serving
