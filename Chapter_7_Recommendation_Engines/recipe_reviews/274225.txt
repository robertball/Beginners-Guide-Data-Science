This recipe turned out great. It was very flavorful.  I did modify the recipe a little. I grated a small ginger root and added 1 tbs of fish sauce.

Made this last night. EVERYONE went back for seconds. It is very addicting! Just enough heat  and flavor. Made it exactly as called, except I doubled the recipe. Pretty quick and easy to make. There is more time in prep than actual cook time. It came together really easy. Will definitely be making this again!

I halved the portions to try it out first. Initially I thought it would be spicy, but it turned out to be OK for me. Very easy to make. I used Bell peppers, eggplant and mushroom, so they do not go to waste. I will probably add lemongrass next time and try it.

This is exquisite and delicious. Took it to a pot luck and came home with an empty pot filled with compliments. I modified the recipe a tiny bit, using one small onion and one small red pepper instead of the halves called for.

I was not that excited about this recipe before I made it, but I like soup so much that I just had to try it.  As it turns out it was one of the best soups that i have ever made, and my family raved about it!
