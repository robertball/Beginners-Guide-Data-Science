Husband made this quick dessert for the boys while I was at work *sad face* so I didn't get to participate but all three of them said this recipe was "freaking awesome". My husband made a slight twist on his and used a Reese's cup in his and he said that was even better. Huge hit with the boys--I'm bummed I missed out. We'll use this again and again. NOTE: There are new marshmallows on the market now that actually come square shaped, so they had those to use this time. My husband said that helped make it less messy in the microwave. Oh, and they used Super Chunk peanut butter.

These s'mores are great!   Try using RITZ crackers instead of graham crackers.  Also try 4 mini marshmellows and, on top of that, 4 Tollhouse baking chocolate chips.  [bake for 30 seconds]   Plus, put Jif peanut butter on both sides.          Enjoy!

We made these without peanut butter and they worked wonderfully!  We can make four at a time in our microwave, and with a family of seven that is important.

I kind of laughed when I seen this recipe. It reminded me of something my little neice and nephew would have come up with when they lived with me and had full use of the cubard. But, I let the curiosity get the best of me anyway. I used nestle dark chocolate chips, skippy creamy natural peanut butter, and 1 large marshallow. I was surprised at how watching a marshallow expand in the microwave held my attention. I am not sure if that is something I needed to learn. lol Either way cute quick recipe. My neice and nephew would flip if they seen these and how easy they were to make. I might have to send them the recipe now. : )

These are delicious and fast! Since I didn't have chocolate candy bars at home I actually used Nutella! Just spread it on the cracker! So yummy!

these are fantastic!!! Even better than over the fire (except for the roasted marshmallow) because the chocolate melts and combines with the peanut butter.

So easy and so yummy.  10 seconds is perfect for our microwave.  I thought, no way will that be long enough but it was plenty.  Any longer and the marshmallows will start to harden.  Keep a close watch though in case one tries to roll on you when it starts to puff up.  Takes longer to clean faces afterwards than the entire make and eat process.
