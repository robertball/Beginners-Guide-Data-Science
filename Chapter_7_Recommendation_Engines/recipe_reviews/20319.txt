Yes, it tastes just like an apple pie...My husband and kids don't care for pie crust, so I used graham crackers for the bottom "crust" and oatmeal/cinnamon/brown sugar/melted butter combo sprinkled on the top(like an apple crisp). I sliced the zucchini with a mandolin slicer so it was paper thin, but I think I'll try regular slices next time, for more of an "apple wedge" kind of texture. I will also try to use smaller zucchini to avoid some of the seeds, but no one seemed to notice. I microwaved the zucchini for a few minutes and added it hot to the sugar/cinnamon mix.  It does taste just like apple pie (or apple crisp) and I am looking forward to trying it with splenda to make it a little more diet friendly! Thanks for a great recipe Sonya!!

It doesn't say to peel the zucchini, so I didn't since I'm trying to learn to follow recipes and not to cupboard cook so much.  Well, my mistake for not thinking clearly.

It does taste very good and it does need to be peeled for visual appeal.

Awesome pie that fooled my entire family into thinking it was apple!  Great use of garden zucchini.  I used larger ones, peeled them and scooped out most of the seeds first.  My normal apple pie recipe also calls for 1 T. orange juice concentrate which I added to this pie.  DELISH!

Great recipe.  My husband forgot that it was zucchini pie and asked what kind of apples I used.  Will make again as we always have lots of zucchini in our garden. Make sure to peel and seed the zucchini before slicing.  I used all of a very large zucchini.

Just like Apple Pie!  This was delicious and a great way to get rid of my extra zucchini.  My husband hates zucchini.  I made this and told him it was apple.  He never knew the difference and LOVED it...  he licked his plate!  :-)  Will make again!

This was really, really good! I had so much zucchini and was desperately seeking recipes to slip them into as my family was so sick of eating them.  I stumbled across this recipe and thought it was worth a try.  My whole family loved it.  We ate it with some vanilla ice cream. Delicious!

This was fabulous.  Don't forget to peel the sues and cut them to the same size you would apples.  Don't slice them, chunk them for nicer consistency.  Cooks up so the zukes are still firm but tender.  Might put in 3/4 to 1 cup sugar instead of just 3/4 cup...

This was very good. I did peel the zucchini and added a cup of raisins it gave it great texture.

I made this just for kicks...but it sure fooled the kids!!  They all thought it was apple pie.  Was fun to make...I would ommit the tapioka though, and go half with the cinamon.

This was wonderful. Gave some to my in-laws and after I told them it wasnâ€™t apple, they were flabbergasted!  I used 6 cups of zucchini though. 4 cups looked kind of sparse.

Followed the directions and it came out great! I'd cut back on the lemon juice next time- personal preference. Really good consistency; tapioca made the difference.

Great use of extra zucchini.  I did mix in three small apples for about 6 cups of zucchini and apple slices combined.

Amazing. Really does taste like apple pie. Has a little too much lemon juice I think.

The family and neighbors gobbled this up and were shocked when I told them it was zucchini! Of course, they wanted the recipe! What a refreshing take on zucchini! Thank you!

Tastes like apple pie. My husband liked it, but suggested a bit more sugar (1 cup?) to compensate for the sweetness found naturally in apples.

awesome, tastes just like apple pie and the zucchini was apple slices consistency in texture.  I followed the recipe with no changes; but a lattice top crust instead. My husband and I were totally amazed and had no problem finishing off this pie!
