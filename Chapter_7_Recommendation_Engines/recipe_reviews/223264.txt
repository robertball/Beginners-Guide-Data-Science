I made as directed  and it lacked seasoning.  I added shell pasta, salt and Old Bay Seasoning and didn't put it over greens it was very good!  I don't like rating a recipe if not made exactly as posted.  I would recommend this recipe over greens and/or with pasta added.  Makes a really good base for many different ideas.
