I was searching for a recipe that used peanut butter and had an Allstar suggest this recipe. I elected to use sesame oil, and only used 1/2 tsp of the chile paste. These two are the only changes I made. This recipe is NOT for the faint of heart! It **IS** spicy, but very good! The yogurt lends a cooling touch, but it will still bring a lot of heat! The only improvement I can think of would be to add some julienned carrots, and maybe some snow peas. Overall it is a great recipe, but lacks the deep Asian notes I was searching for.

This recipe was easy and an elegant meal to serve at a dinner party.  The garnish of cilantro, yogurt and peanuts was especially tasty and pleasing to the eyes!

It was pretty good. I think it needs more flavors. I think next time I'll add more peanut butter.
