These were simple to make. I added 1 cup of finely chopped dates and omitted the nuts and they still turned out very very good. I baked them in a 300 F convection oven for 9 minutes. Yummy!

I just made it and it tastes really good and crunchy. The only thing was it was hard to mix in the cereal, coconut and walnuts. I will only use three cups of rice cereal next time. Great recipe.

This is a great all-around cookie. It's not too sweet but sweet enough for the little ones. It has a soft middle but a nice crunch from the Krispies. I had a few dried dates I wanted to use up so they got chopped up and thrown in there as well. Next time I may try throwing in some chocolate chips. This is a wonderful recipe and easily adjustable to suit your taste.
