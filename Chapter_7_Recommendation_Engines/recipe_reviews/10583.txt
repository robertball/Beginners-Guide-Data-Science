What disappointed me the most about this recipe, were the photos.  One would assume that it is perfect for cut-out sugar cookies since the photos are all of cut-outs, but not the case.  This recipe is way too sticky for cut-outs so please change the photos so someone else isn't mistaken like I was.

i thought i found the perfect sugar cookie recipe,the dough was very easy to work with,and is good for using cookie cutters,it holds it shape well,but it tasted like flour and butter cookies,i cut the recipe in half(54 cookies)i added twice as much white sugar,a good cookie to decorate

This has always been my favorite sugar cookie recipe for many years.  The orginial name was "white sugar cookies"  The last time I made them I used the prepacked "butter flavor crisco" This makes this cookie even richer.  I also use purchased sugar and cinnamon mixture.  Almond and lemon extracts make these have a different flavor.  They are addicting and don't last long in my house.  Oh by the way, these cookies spread as they cook.

I was asked to make 100 sugar cookies for Vacation Bible School.  I looked up recipes on the internet and chose this one.  It was marvelous!  I got several comments on them!  Thank you for a very easy, and very good cookie, that I will definately make again.

I made these yesterday for our American Girl Club tea party. I saved some for my family.  My husband kept coming into the kitchen to claim another one and said: These are addicting. My youngest daughter who doesn't like cookies ate 3 or 4. Today they asked me to bake them again. Very delicious to taste and easy to bake.

The cookies taste GREAT. I don't recommend this one for cookie cutters. The dough is stickier than I expected. You can use cutters if you refrigerate for about an hour.

I have made a lot of different sugar cookie recipes. I decided to try this one today and absolutely loved it. This will be the one I use from now on. I did let my kids add M&M's to half of them.

This is definitely not a cookie for a cookie cutter. It is sticky and refrigerating the dough does not help. The pictures are misleading to say the least. Be forewarned.

This sugar cookie tastes great, and can be rolled and shape-cut (refrigerate first) if we feel like it!

I am NOT a baker, but these turned out great for me!  We rolled them (after chilling for a while) and they worked out great!  Thanks for the recipe!  My kids had a blast cutting them out and decorating!

We tried these and "sugar cookies with buttercream frosting."  These weren't as good.  Not bad, but others were better.  They spread more, too - so I doubt they'd be a good choice for cutouts.  I just waxpapered them in a log & sliced.

Really yummy recipe! And I found a round about way to use this for cut outs. Its very sticky, so I took small portions from my mixing bowl and flattened them using my hands (a rolling pin would not work) on a sheet of wax paper. I then cut out however many I had space for, removed the excess dough from around the cutout cookies and then lifted the wax paper in one hand to flip the cookie over into my other. It worked like a charm and actually went faster then I thought it would. Also instead of shortening , I didn't have any, I just used what I did have which was 1/2 cup margarine and 1/4 cup of oil.

I was able to use this recipe to make my cut outs and was thrilled. I wish it was a little more sugary tasting. It is a good cookie and I would use the recipe again and perhaps follow some of the recommendations as far as dipping it into chocolate or drizzling some more sweetness on it! Thanks!

These do have a good flavor, but are not really soft.  I prefer my sugar cookies soft.  Also, I cut the recipe in half, so I was expecting approx. 50 cookies.  I only got 30.  I will not make these again and will go back to my other recipe.  Sorry!

I loved the taste of this recipe, but they are not good for cut out cookies, the finished product crumbles pretty easily.  Used half almond and half lemon extract.

Thanks for a good recipe! I needed to add more flour and they turned a little dryer than I like, but overall were pretty good.

i loved this recipe. Very easy to make and taste great. It was a little sticky when I was trying to cut them with cookie cutters. A little flour did the trick to fix it.

Turned out great! I added about 2 cups of extra flour to make the dough thick enough to make cutout cookies. They taste great, and are the perfect texture! Thanks for the recipe!

I like sugar cookies but I hate having to roll out the dough and use cut-outs. This recipe is a great alternative, and the cookies turn out perfect -- nice and soft and rich. Love it!

LOVE these! I normally make changes to recipes just to add my own twist but these didn't need it. I refrigerated my dough overnight and then used a cookie cutter for half the dough. They came out perfect. The other half I followed the directions of rolling them into a ball and dipping in sugar. Both ways were great!

This is a great 'standard' recipe for the type of sugar cookies that we all remember from childhood. You know, the ones shaped like Christmas trees, bats, pumpkins, hearts, whatever. I would suggest that when making them, you lightly flour your counter, and lightly flour a rolling pin. Then roll the dough out to the thickness you want. This recipe IS very sticky.

Dough and cookies are very yummy. After baked, the cookies held together great and were perfect for decorating.

Recipe is great for scooping and flattening (as the recipe suggests), but is a bit sticky and limp for cutting out shapes with the little people in your life.

I follow the recipe, and these sugar cookies are the bomb!! My family loves these cookies, and my church family raves over them. 
I have tried adding Pure Lemon Extract (about 3/4 tsp--along with the vanilla), and we all thought they were even better than the regular version! Sometimes I skip the part where you flatten with a glass-the cookies turn out great either way. I have even skipped rolling the dough in sugar, and just dipped the bottom of my glass in sugar, then flattened. Cuts sugar a bit, but not taste.

I thought from the pictures that this would make shape cookies and I could cut out fun shapes but it's a DROP cookie recipe. The reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 1 is because they are SOOOOO good!!!!

It turned out excellent.  Especially since my friend and I can't cook anything with out burning them. My mom who doesn't even like sugar cookies, likes them.  Definitely a keeper for recipes.

Tastes great, and to make into an easy cut out, roll dough out onto a sheet of wax paper, place in freezer until firm, use cookie cutter to cut shapes, return to freezer until firm, use a spatula to remove shapes from wax paper, place on parchment paper covered cookie sheet, and bake.

If you like a soft, moist sugar cookie, this recipe isn't for you.  I saw this recipe had good reviews, so I tried it.  The cookie has good flavor and is easy, but the texture is like a store-bought shortbread cookie.  Not a fan!
