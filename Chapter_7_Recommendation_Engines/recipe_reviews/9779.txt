I found this recipe to be quite annoying. Having gone to all the trouble of preparing the three steps needed to complete this recipe, waiting the three hours for it to chill, and then trying to put them together, it was a nightmare!

They did, however, taste as good as they looked, which was not very good.

Sorry Laria :(

My grandma makes cookies like these, not exactly the same, but quite similar. I used the recipe, but prior to refrigerating I rolled out the dough to about 4in x 13in on parchment paper. Then placed the filling in a long roll on top of the dough and used the parchment paper to help roll the dough around the filling. Then placed in the fridge for 3 hours. Sliced and place on a baking sheet. I got a good 24 cookies. So easy!

This is one of my favorite cookie recipes.  The cookies are a little cakey, but I like that.  The recipe that I had had the same ingredients but different directions.  It said to roll out the cookie dough in one big piece, put the filling in the middle and cut into slices.

The flavor was great. I could not get the pin wheel to work this time. (I'm sure it had something to do with operator error I rolled it but forgot to slice it. Oops it was ME because I don't bake much).  And everyone loved them... all of the cookies are gone they were a "big hit" at work. I will defiantly do them again but this time I'll slice them.

I liked the idea and the ingredients, but the cookies were too cakey and quite flavorless.
