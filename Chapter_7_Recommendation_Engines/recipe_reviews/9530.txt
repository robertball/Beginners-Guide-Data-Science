From the blurb under the title about fresh ingredients, I was a bit shocked that it called for processed cheese food. I know it's a popular dip, but use some other kind of cheese.

I made this in a crockpot for our Christmas day buffet.  It was really good.  The addition of fresh veggies makes it taste great!  I added more jalapeno because we like it spicy!
