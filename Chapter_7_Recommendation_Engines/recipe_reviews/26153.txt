I have an Italian co-worker who makes the most amazing cookies for the holiday potluck. She calls them "love knots" and I covet them. This recipe is so close that I'm calling it a match. I can't tell my co-worker...I'm afraid I could end up with concrete shoes in the bottom of the river! The dough is very soft so I set it in the fridge for 30 minutes and used a Pampered Chef small scoop to form the cookies (approx 1 tablespoon), then placed on parchment paper. They did not spread much so 2 inches apart is more than sufficient. These cookies are not golden (until you lift them off the pan). They are done when they don't look wet/shiny. Make sure to allow the cookies to rest for 5 minutes before removing them from the pan. You won't be disappointed! I ended up with just over 50 small rounded cookies.

I always loved these and was happy to find the recipe again. They definitely need the frosting as they're not overly sweet. Be careful not to overbake as they don't get a golden color like most cookies do when they're done.

These were so good!  I normally only like cookies with some kind of chocolate in them, but I had some ricotta in the fridge and didn't know what to do with it.  I agree with a previous reviewer that you really have to check these because you don't want to overbake them.  They don't look done at 8 or 9 minutes, but they probably are.  Check the bottoms to make sure they're a light golden brown color.  Thank you, Pam for this recipe.

Perfetto! Every year we put on a little Italian festival at our shop, and are always looking for the right treats to share with our customers. We used to order yummy tiramisu cupcakes, but our baker retired...so we searched at the last minute for a little sweet morsel to serve, and these cookies were perfect! I changed the servings to 96, and we made up a great batch for a crowd (we made them a bit smaller, to stretch it a bit).  I did add a bit of lemon zest, which added some nice flavor. Tonight I'm going to make them again (not 96 of them, though!) and I'll add a dash of limoncello. Delizioso!

This is the perfect recipe to use up extra ricotta.  The cookies are so moist and light.  I ran out of vanilla before making the frosting, so I added about a teaspoon of lemon extract to cut the sweetness a little bit -- came out great.  One note -- I ended up with about 5 dozen cookies, not 3 dozen, and I was making them even larger than the recipe called for!  Also had a lot of extra frosting, so I would cut that down a bit (unless you like them smothered!).

These were so interesting!  More like a little cake than a cookie, and not much flavor until frosted.  Kind of spongy.  I didn't have enough ricotta so I had to use about 1/2 cup light sour cream (might have caused the sponginess...)  I put in some almond extract, which was delicious.  Even though they were kind of funny looking, the whole family enjoyed them, and they were very easy to make!

Most amazing cookies ever!  You have to try them.  They dont spread as much as you would think, so dont worry about that.  Also, I omitted one egg and addded more ricotta.  Good stuff, easy, and I love them!!  Thanks for this excellent recipe

Absolutely delicious!  I have been looking for a great italian cookie recipe - mission accomplished, I will be making these every Easter - a new tradition!   Used a cookie spoon to keep uniform size, do not add more flour, this is a moist cookie dough.   Icing suggestions - made the icing according to recipe, divided into 2 bowls.  In one I added 1/2 teaspoon pure almond flavoring, one drop of red food coloring and enough milk to thin to a glaze. The other I added orange juice to thin to a glaze, then dipped slightly warm cookie in glaze.  Decorated with various cookie sprinkles, crushed walnuts on orange iced cookies - a pretty and delicious cookie, family loved them!

I'm not much of a cookie person, but these were fabulous.  I was trying to use up ricotta cheese and thought I'd chance something strange like putting it in a cookie.  The cheese definitely added an interesting flavor, without being overly obvious.  None of my family could figure out what was in them.  I didn't bother with the frosting because they were good already and I thought that would ruin them.

These delectable little morsels remind me of a childhood cookies made by an Italian neighbor.I've looked for a long time to find a recipe to match my memory,and I think this is it. I sprinkled the tops after icing with Non Pareils. Stored in an air tight container, the non parils soften and the cookie remains soft,moist and delicious. Great flavor.

These are good, cake-like, sugar-cookie-tasting cookies.  I can't say I'd go out of my way to make these but if I ever have any leftover Ricotta again I'll be sure to make these.

I only made these cookies because I was trying to use up some leftover ricotta cheese and I was very disappointed in these cookies. I think the flavoring should be lemon or almond to give it more kick. The cookies towards the end spread like crazy, so if I make these cookies again I will: Use a different flavoring, and chill the dough before I bake them.

These are the yummiest cookies I have ever tasted.  Not too sugary sweet, but sooo creamy.  I'm not of Italian descent, but these taste like something you'd find in an italian  bakery.  It must be the ricotta.  Now I have an excuse to buy ricotta cheese! Try these, you will not regret it!  They don't even need the icing.

These cookies resemble an Italian cookie my mom makes..but these are better. I've made them twice now.  They are easy to make, moist, and are a big hit.  I separated the frosting into small batches and colored each batch a spring time color.  I frosted them very lightly so as not to overpower this lightly flavored cookie. People liked them frosted and unfrosted, by the way. I always use parchment paper lightly sprayed with Pam when baking cookies. No pan clean-up!  My Italian mom asked for the recipe..It's definitely a keeper.

This cake-like cookie is just amazing! I've made them numerous times since Christmas with different sprinkles for each holiday. People rave and always want the recipe. I use a Tbsp. cookie scoop and I use a more buttery icing-with 1/2 cup butter, 3.5 c. powdered sugar, 1 teaspoon vanilla and half and half as needed. Such a nice gift for new moms and dads.

I mad ethese cookies for a wedding reception.  Used lemon flavoring in the dough and lemon juice in the frosting.  Very tender cookies that are delicate in texture.  Lovely for something fancy.

These are great! So easy to make.  My brother had been asking me to make a cannoli cookie for him.  He said he had it at a Brooklyn bakery but I could not find a recipe anywhere.  After searching I made this and he said it was dead on!  So yummy!!  This is a keeper.

(I added a little lemon zest) My grandchildren are eating them faster than I can bake them. They are very tender little cake like cookie. I normally make an almond flavor firmer cookie but this was a good change, a keeper, but I will still make my long time Italian cookie recipe.

YUM! I had a bit of ricotta left over from a calzone recipe I tried recently, so I did a search on here and this was one of the suggestions that popped up. :) Although I already have a favorite sugar cookie recipe, I decided to give these a try. I am SOOO glad I did! Not only was this an ingenious way to use up leftover ricotta, doing so produced the moistest, cake-like cookies EVER!!! These remind me of mini tea cakes. They are cute, delicate and ever so slightly sweet. I bet these would be AWESOME topped with the homemade confectioner's sugar frosting, but since I already had a container of vanilla frosting in my pantry, I used that instead. The next time I make these (there WILL be a next time!), I'll go all out and whip up a batch of frosting too. I can only imagine the possibilities - adding lemon or anise extract are two thoughts that come to mind. As Tricia Jaeger did, I too decorated my cookies with colored sprinkles (another item I wanted to clear out of my pantry). NOTE: Using a small Pampered Chef scoop (~ 1 T) worked really well. I ened up with 30 perfectly petite-sized cookies (Note to self: This recipe yields WAY more than 3 dozen cookies lol!). Thanks SO much for sharing your recipe, PGOETZ719. I'll never purchase the cookies from my local Italian market's bakery again! :-)

OMG, these were AWESOME! My hubby & 7 year old LOVED them and so did I. Had some left over ricotta & threw these together at last minute. These are forgiving as I didn't have quite enough ricotta so I added a little cream cheese to compensate. Used almond extract in the cookie mix instead of vanilla but used vanilla for glaze/frosting. As others stated, after 10 min they don't look cooked, but they are, just check the bottom. They have a cake-like texture and are simply awesome! Thank you so much for this recipe!

WOW!  The taste of this cookie definitely caught me by surprise.  I made these for a bbq we were going to and everyone liked them so much there really weren't many left to take with us.  Oops!  The only thing I changed was to add almond extract to the frosting instead of the vanilla, it was delicious!!  I also frosted these right out of the oven to allow the frosting to melt, it takes on a smoother look that way.  I think I might have to buy ricotta just to make this recipe now....

Add a little almond extract! This is such a delicious cookie. The ricotta is that hidden ingredient that makes it special.
Hide them, because they are addictive!

These are sooooo good.Easy to make, I used almond extract in place of the vanilla for cookies, and in the frosting I did use the vanilla but then after tasting added 1/4 tsp almond extract. Delish!!I will be making these every christmas! I frosted them and put sprinkles on half of the cookies, some of us dont like the sprinkles.

I doubled this recipe and made 2 changes. I used 1/2 whole wheat pastry flour, 1/2 unbleached flour and I used a 32 oz container of ricotta (instead of 16 oz doubling would call for). Oh, I also needed about 2 extra TBS of milk for the frosting.  Using my tsp. scoop, I made over 150 cookies!!!  The cookies were a big hit for our family get together.  They were best the first day.  Very moist!

Exceptional, melt-in-your-mouth cookies. The pillowy texture and subtle flavor reminded us of French Madeleine cookies. Made these for husband's work Christmas party; they were a huge hit! Thank you for sharing.

OMG!  These were so easy and melt in your mouth!  I did need to add a small amount of extra flour to get the right consistency, but not too much.  The frosting makes the cookie, too.  Next time I want to try this with almond extract, as that has always been big in my mother's Sicilian family. Thanks for an easy, tasty recipe!

Such a MARVELOUS cookie. Try icing them while they are still warm--the icing oozes down like a glaze. YUM!

I chose this recipe as I had 4 ounces of ricotta cheese to use and figured I would give these a whirl as they sounded unique!  Texture reminds me a little of cake, and these have a very delicate, not too sweet flavour which would be complemented nicely by virtually any frosting you use.  I opted to leave them as is, but would absolutely add the frosting when I made the next time!

This cookie was amazing.  I made it exactly as instructed and it turned out wonderfully moist with the most fabulous flavor.  I am busy sening the recipe off to friends as I know they will love it as much as my family did.  My husband requested I make more so that we could take them over to family and friends.  He told me that cookies as good as these needed to be shared.

wow. i rarely make cookies from scratch and i never made italian cookies before and these are delicious. so moist and light and just sweet enough. i wanted to make something different and without chocolate chips. i followed the recipe except when making the frosting, i added an extra tablespoon of butter and i used pure orange extract instead of vanilla. the vanilla in the cookie with the orange flavored frosting was a great combo.

These tasted good.  They are super duper soft though.  They were completely golden like they were done on the bottom but my brother and friend thought they were a little too soft.  They ate them all though.  I added almond extract to the icing and I thought that made them taste even better.  Thanks!

Easy to make dough. Was a bit runny in my case so it made more then 36 cookies. Maybe next time I will bake them a little longer, the are a bit too soggy I think.
The icing, I used at least double the milk and added a big splurge of lemon juice. This lightened the sweetness of the icing and the combo with the cookies is great.

This cookie is one of the best I ever baked.  It's quick, easy and delicious.  A warning though frost them fast or they'll all be eaten before you get the chance.  I'll be baking these quite often. Thanks Pam!

I liked these cookies.  This recipe is a great way to use up extra ricotta.  However, as other reviewers have said, these "cookies" were very cakey.  I don't know that I'd call them cookies.  And the cookies themselves aren't very sweet at all, while the frosting is incredibly sweet!

Really good.....but I was a little disappointed that these cookies did not get puffy like other recipes I have tried. Will add baking powder instead of soda next time for a more puffier cookie. Taste was there and I do love to add the ricotta to these as they make the cookies moist on the inside. I did not add butter to my icing. Just used confectioners sugar, skim milk, and my extracts of choice. I did some with anise icing and some with lemon icing and added pastel sprinkles. Family enjoyed. Thanks!

Very tasty, like a little mini vanilla cake. Great for something a little different. The cookie needs the frosting, without the frosting the cookie is just so-so.

Wow not really an Italian cookie that I remember- these came out like a soft cake- almost like the texture if you made a cupcake into a cookie. Spongy and too soft just like cake! Not my idea of the traditional Italian cookie! Followed the recipe to the tee!!

Quite yummy and light and sweet. I added 1/2 tsp almond extract for an additional flavor. Makes a TON. (closer to 5 dozen). I skipped the glaze, as I wanted something just lightly sweet.

This was a very good recipe. I had just the perfect amount of extra ricotta in the fridge. I used 1 tbsp of vanilla and also added 1 tsp of pure almond extract to the batter. To the frosting I added some almond extract as well. Overall a great, old fashioned, Italian recipe. Thank you for sharing it!

Beautiful, soft, almost cake-like texture. I followed recipe exactly and have always had excellent results, although these cookies will brown a bit if you use a fan-forced oven. I also use a small-gauge ice cream scoop to make evenly sized cookies. This is a much loved, much requested cookie recipe. Thanks for sharing!

These are absolutely delicious, and so easy to make! I didn't make any changes to the recipe...it made about 30 cookies, and there was *just enough* frosting. I almost wish I would have made a tad more, but you didn't really need it. I baked them for exactly 10 minutes and they came out perfect...very moist and tasty. I'll definitely be making them again.

I made these cookies and they were ok.  It was a nice use for the leftover ricotta cheese.  I don't think I'd make them again, however.  They didn't store well, got really soggy, and seemed to lose flavor.  I wound up throwing away the whole batch.  I have a recipe for Ricotta cakes, which I think I will finally try next time I have leftover ricotta.

I was looking for a few new cookie recipes to try to add to our Christmas Cookie list and decided to try these.  WoW, was a delightful cookie!  I followed the recipe as stated except I did use almond extract instead of vanilla.  We also sprinkled red and white sugar crystals on them.  My family wouldn't leave them alone.  I had to hide them in the garage refridgerator!  These will be on the "list" this year!

These are a cookie staple for Christmas! I do a few different versions: some plain, some almond icing, lemon, or vanilla. This recipe is great as is. This is so good, it had replaced our traditional Italian cookie recipe passed down for generations. It softer, same flavor profile, and easier to make. Love it!

Awesome recipe! I took these in to my Italian class and everyone loved them. The texture is more cake-like than cookie-like. They stayed soft for days and were melt-in-your-mouth every time. I added some almond extract to the glaze, and the flavour was perfect. I will make these again.

WOW! These practically melt in your mouth! I had some ricotta cheese that I needed to use up, so I thought I'd give these a shot, and I was very pleased. They almost remind me of a cookie that I recall from my childhood that the local Mennonite bakery made, called an Old Fashioned Cream (if anyone knows the recipe for those PLEASE let me know!) Thanks!!!

These were really really good, but I hesitate to call them cookies.  They're more like cookie-shaped mini-spongecakes.  The pictures show nice lofty round cookies.  Mine came out kinda flat.  It was probably due to old baking soda, but the flavor was still very good. When I'm in the mood for a cookie I won't make these, but I think they would be wonderful for a baby shower with the icing tinted baby blue or pink.

For what these cookies ARE (they are not sugar cookies, etc), they are amazing. Perfectly soft, coupled with a nicely complementing sweet icing.

Not bad, but very sweet due to the icing.  Very moist. The only suggestion I have is to add sprinkles or jimmies to the top of the cookies, otherwise they look a little bland.  But a good way to use up ricotta cheese.

These cookies are okay.  Very easy to make and very  moist.  They just don't have much flavor except for the frosting.  But it's a great way to use up leftover ricotta cheese.  I will try again but I will add either anise or lemon extract instead.

These are very good...the frosting makes the cookie.  My only complaint is that they are a bit difficult to store.  When I make cookies, I make several types at once and then take trays of cookies to several elderly people I know.  These cookies are just a little harder to transport because they are so moist.  The flavor, however, is delicious.

These are one of my favorite cookies, I never put the icing on because I think this cookie really stands on it's own and is a favorite with the adults, one small reason is because when friends are making merry they often like a glass of wine and many sweets just do not go well with wine, this little cookie has just the right flavor, it really is perfect without the icing!

This recipe is no big deal.  It's really not worth spending the time on it.  There's no distinctive flavor that makes you say "wow" (like chocolate or lemon or raspberry would.) Find another one to try...

You need to add a little more flour to these for them to actually come right but the recipe overall is good. I've made them about ten times now. Please keep in mind a good baker/cook will know, that depending on humidity, elevation etc... often times you must add or subtract flour to things. This recipe is no different.  Use your eyes and hands to judge if it is right. If it's slightly doughy but still soft, there is enough flour. :)

These cookies are fantastic! Like others have mentioned, I was looking for a recipe to use up some ricotta cheese I had. These cookies well exceeded my expectations. I thought they were tasty all on their own, and the icing just makes them even better in my opinion! Initially the consistency of the icing wasn't what I was hoping for, so I just added a little extra milk until it came out like I wanted. The cookies were a huge hit with my family. Will definitely be making them again!

These were absolutely delicious!   I liked them just as well  without the frosting.   It is important to use quality ingredients.  Real butter, fresh whole milk ricotta, etc.  I made a half recipe and used a silicone mat. Yielded 1 dozen scrumptious cookies.

I wanted to duplicate Italian lemon cookies that a local Italian bakery makes, so I used lemon extract in the cookies and in the frosting. My 13 yo daughter tried one and said they are better than the bakery's cookies! I will be making more today! They are delicious, must be the ricotta that really makes these cookies! Thank you for the recipe.

Yes indeedy! These are a favorite in our family and a very old tradition. Dad calls these cookies "the miracle of Christmas". I double this recipe for my own cookie jar and it makes about 80 cookies. I quadruple the batch when I have to fill Dad's cookie jar too! : )

Excellent, authentic recipe.
Don't over bake, refrigerate dough between batches, and maybe use icing instead of the frosting. Great unique flavor and visually beautiful.

Did not use the ricotta as we don't like the taste and cookies are great without it as well

I just finished making these cookies and wanted to get a review in!  They are excellent!  I've been baking cookies for 60 years and these are a real winner.  They put a regular sugar cookie to shame.  They are easy to make--just get the ricotta cheese and enjoy! Had to bake longer than the 10 minutes but that may be my oven, and I added a little more milk to the frosting.  Do try them!

I have to admit these were a lot better than I expected.  The "cake like cookie" didn't exactly appeal to me.  I substituted lemon extract for vanilla and 1/2 cup almond meal, 1/4 cup whole wheat pastry flour and 1 1/4 cups of AP flour for 2 cups of just AP flour.  They were great without any frosting (and I didn't feel like going thru the process if it didn't need it).  

Next time I'm going to try dipping them in a lemon glaze.  I'll post it when I do and let you know how it turns out.

great cookie - not too sweet, very moist and dense!  baked at 325 for 8 mins. until the edges JUST started turning brown.  the tops will still be very white and you'll think they aren't done yet but break one open and it probably will be!

This recipe is excellent! Moist, buttery and just the perfect sweetness. Don't cook for more than 8 minutes. Also, I put shredded coconut on top of a few of mine and it made them that much better! Still great without coconut. A recipe I will keep for a long time.

I loved these cookies!  They were so easy to make.  I doubled the recipe because I was making them for a wedding.  Got 7 dozen total.  The cookies are cake-like but so moist.  They are good plain but the icing adds to the flavor.  Only change I made was on icing.  Instead of milk, I added orange juice.  Had to add a little more liquid (OJ) than called for to get the consistency I liked but the icing still hardened enough to stack nicely for freezing until wedding day.  Instead of spreading the icing like the original picture shows, I used cake bag/tip and squeezed a decoration on top of each.  They were pretty.  Will definitely put these into my norm for Christmas cookies.

I made these for my family and my father really enjoyed them, and thats a good thing!  He said I could make these again!  I decreased the sugar in the batter by a small amount, and substituted lemon extract, because I thought it would be refreshing.  I think it would be equally good with the vanilla.

This cookie recipe was easy to make and the final product tastes amazing! I used real ricotta (not the kind in the tub) and beated it in with the eggs. I will definitely making these cookies every Christmas to come!

I put the 1/2 cup of butter in as the recipe said.  But in step 4 it says "remaining butter".    The cookies came out flat with the 1/2 cup of butter.   So... cut 2 tablespoons off of your butter stick to reserver for the icing.   It also took more like 10 minutes for the cookies to cook.

Love these cookies.  I substituted almond extract.  Much better cookie.  Only problem is they don't keep long, so you can't make them more than a day or two in advance.  They actually start to melt together if stacked in a container.

These cookies are insanely delicious. They're like a cake cookie. So good! The frosting is the great too. If you put sprinkles on them be sure to put them on right after you frost them because the frosting will harden up a bit and the sprinkles wont stick. Overall the best cookies ive ever made.

Exactly what I expected after reading the reveiws: light, cake-like, not too sweet, and done after 9 minutes.  I cut the frosting in half and could have used a bit more, but a full batch of frosting would have been too much.  They were good for a change.

very good. super moist and light. I used almond extract, and vanilla for frosting but I think next time I will use almond for both. I did make the frosting more like a glaze as it is very sweet and the cookie is very delicate both in composition and taste. Will definately make again, kids loved them.

These are pretty tasty. The icing is good, but really sweet so it overpowers the ricotta a bit. It's really optional. Try it both ways.

This is an unusual cookie, so if you are looking for something different this is a good recipe to go with.  It has a texture somewhere between a cake and a scone.  The taste is very light, good for people who like simple foods or for picky eaters.  Most people will think they are sugar cookies, so be sure to let them know what they are so they don't think there's something wrong with them!

These cookies were good. I accidentally forgot the vanilla in the cookies and they still tasted great. The frosting definitely adds a nice sweetness. Next time I might try thinning out the frosting to make more of a glaze.

I made this recipe gluten free with rice flour and the ricotta cheese really helped keep these cookies light and airy.  Would make a good half moon cookie base too!

I thought these cookies were phenominal. I prefer the icing to be a little thinner so I added a little more milk to it. Another variation I tried was to substitute 8 ounces of cream cheese for the ricotta. THey were thicker and held their shape better and tasted soooooo good!

I can't say YUMMMMMM loud enough!  This was the end to an almost perfect Italian Thanksgiving at our house this year.  We always have an "untraditional" meal at Thanksgiving and with this year being Italian, I thought these cookies would make an appropriate desert......I have made them again since and even felt comfortable giving a batch to one of my college professors whose mother is from Sicily.  He told me I had made his Mamma's christmas cookies...and had done a great job! 

UPDATE:  I've made these several times and they are ALWAYS a hit with everyone who tries them.

I just got done frosting these cookies, and it took every ounce of willpower to walk away from them in order to rate the recipe.  They are phenomenal.  A complete change from my normal choc-chip cookies, so light and fluffy and delicious.  Perfect for after a pasta dinner with an espresso.  Thank you so much for this recipe!!!

I have to say that I was a tad skeptical when I read the ingredients.  I wanted to make an all Italian dinner with dessert.  But these were so good and I loved how simple they were to cook.  Great recipe thanks!

This is a very moist cookie and I love the texture, but it needs a little more flavor.  I think I'll at least double the vanilla next time and maybe add a little almond extract.  They really are good, just need a little extra oomph.

I loved these cookies! They have a wonderful cake-like texture without being overly sweet.  The perfect afternoon tea cookie.

Fabulous cookie!  I had some leftover ricotta and found this recipe through an ingredient search.  Light, moist, fluffy, and SO delicious, especially right out of the oven!

These cookies are yummy!  I used a can of store bought vanilla icing and sprinkled them with colored sugar.  They were so pretty when I was finished!  It was a great way to use up ricotta cheese left from making lasagna.

Unbelievablely delicious. My daughter and I ate 3 dozen in 2 days the first time I made them. The next time I brought them to work, everyone wanted the recipe and they ask me to make them for our bake sale for St. Jude. 
Thank you very much for this awsome cookie recipe.

These cookies were very different than your average cookie. They were very light and cake like in texture- almost like a spongecake (like lady fingers or madelines). I will have to try using lemon extract in the cookies and icing next time. I think that would make them even more delicious!! I definately recommend the icing- it adds a lot to the cookie, and takes away from the odd hint of ricotta that may or may not strike others as strange.
