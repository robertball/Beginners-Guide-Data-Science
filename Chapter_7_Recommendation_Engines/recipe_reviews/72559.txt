This recipe wasn't my cup of tea, but the rest of the famliy gave it two big thumbs up. It does make a very hearty meal, especially on a cold rainy night. We ate it with grilled sourdough bread. I might making try it again with some more spices added, I just found the flavor to be somewhat weak compared to the way it smelled and I anticipated it tasting.

This is a good dish that needs help to be great. After reading the other reviews, I added 1 tsp. cumin and 1/2 tsp. cayanne pepper to bump up the heat. We also are low carb in our house so I used turnips instead of potato. The overall flavor was great but the meat was tough. If I make it again, I will try it in the crock pot.

Wonderful recipe!  My husband has eaten two bowls - - - so far!  He's on a low cholesterol diet, and this recipe is perfect for that.  I added a dash of jalepeno salt for zest.  Sure hope there's enough left to freeze!

This is really good!! I read the reviews and decided to try adding some fresh cilantro to spice it up. The cilantro gave it the perfect taste. I will certainly make this again.

Very good. Instead of the potatoes I substituted with butter beans for the protein content (and I discovered that I was out of potatoes).  It turned out delicious and lower in carbs.  I also used beef bouillon instead of broth which added more salt and flavor.

The meat was tough not tender and bland no seasoning  , salt and no flavor. The "soup" was more like eating a bowl of tomato sauce. The onions and garlic were barely existent. The red wine did nothing for the flavor.

This is a fantastic stew. I made it for a group of eight people (ranging in age from 6 to adult), and everyone found someting to like about it. I added big chunks of fried carrots (using the same technique & oil that I used for the potatoes) because I felt the tomato-y-ness of it need some sweetness to balance the acidity. I appreciated the reasonable price of the cut of meat called for in this dish when feeding big eaters.

This wa a great base recipe, my husband raved about it and commented that we could add different spices to change the mixture i.e. add curry powder and serve with naan. I served this with the Light Oat bread from this site to mop up all of the stew.

I made this a 5 star family favorite by adding 1 bay leaf, a teaspoon of cumin, 1/2 teaspoon of chipotle chili powder and a dollop of sour cream on each serving. I'll definitely make this one again and again!

This was pretty good.  Had to add more seasoning (soy sauce, salt)and topped it off with a little lemon juice and hot sauce just before serving.  I think next time I'll add more garlic & spinich.  I wasn't sure what to use for the tomato puree but used a can of tomato paste and added water to make two cups.

Definitely will make again. I did added basil and crushed red pepper for more of an Italian taste.

it was a good start, but too tomato, no spice. We don't eat potatoes, so I substituted 2 cans of great northern beans. I added a tsp of Italian spices, but it wasn't enough. I added a Tbs of cumin, that was the trick. turned out much better, good flavor, everyone enjoyed it then.
