This is an excellent recipe. I used the flours listed, in their exact amounts.  The method was spot on, down to the timing needed in the oven - 18 minutes exactly. They are very good, and even though it is written that they aren't light and fluffy, don't think they are going to be heavy. Definitely a keeper recipe. Thank you for the recipe.

I made these for my gluten-free family members.  They thought these were pretty good, but that was early on in their quest for something to replace what they used to be familiar with.  I will update this as they are more in tune with their new dietary needs.  They were easy to make, and they seemed pretty good to me though not very crispy.
