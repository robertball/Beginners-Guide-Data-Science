Delicious but the measurements are way off (only thing that kept it from 5 stars). I used the measurements for 3 servings on 2 chicken breasts, and found I needed more. Basically double everything. Double the batter and double the baking time. I didnâ€™t have pecans and prefer savory so I mixed in some season-all with the crumbs. Kids loved it!

Made it and really liked it. Definitely going into the rotation. Next time I will pulse the pecans through processor for more of crumb than a chopped product. Learned about the difference between panko & bread crumbs while making this. Still new to all this.

While not bursting with flavor, this is a nice, light recipe that fills you up without making you feel weighted down with food. Also seems on the healthier side. Would make and eat again!

Wow! So good! I used chicken tenders instead of slicing the chicken breast into strips.  Will definitely make this again. Thank you!

I will definitely make this again. This time I only had ground almonds but it turned out nicely.
