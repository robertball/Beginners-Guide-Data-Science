I use flank steak instead. Marinate steak whole with all of Ortega Fajita Seasoning packet except for 1 tbsp. for later use. Rub in just enough e.v.o.o. until a thick paste forms and evenly coats it. Allow meat to come to room temperature. Chop 1 lg. green pepper, 1 lg. red pepper and 1 med. onion. Set aside chopped onion. Use a whole package of Oscar Mayer Thick Cut bacon and slice into about 1/3" pieces. Fry until brown and crisp then drain. Pour out extra fat until just the bottom is covered. Add onion and 2 or more tbsp. of h2o to deglaze pan. Once onions are transparent add peppers along with rest of fajita seasoning. Cook until veggies are soft. Take off heat and snip with kitchen scissors 2 tbsp. of fresh chives along with bacon and stir. Cover in serving bowl to keep warm. Grill your steak medium rare. Both sides should be seared with grill marks. Every grill is different, so you will have to be the judge on that part. Rest steak for 8 to 10 min. then divide meat evenly by cutting with the grain into three long strips. Then cut across the grain with the carving knife at a slight angle into thin strips. Place meat in bowl along with any juices and toss. Cover to keep hot. To serve use big warm tortillas. Place finely shredded cheese on bottom, then meat. Bacon mixture next along with choice of tomatoes,jalapenos,lettuce,sour cream and/or taco sauce. Serve with Spanish rice and Ortega refried beans. Don't forget the beer!  Try it this way and you will love this recipe.

I marinated my meat in a homemade fajita marinade before using it in this recipe. I think that helps when using skirt steak so it's not AS tough. I used my own homemade fajita seasoning as well. The boys thought bacon with fajitas was a winning idea. I didn't care for it, so they ate mine. I'll make this again......for them.

This recipe was a big hit with my family.  I combined instructions from the actual recipe and advice from CHEFBAUER's review.  Especially the slicing of the meat after cooking.  I cooked the steak in the broiler for 10 minutes each side.  The added bacon really helps these fajitas stand apart.  This will be my main recipes for fajitas from now on.

This was a sad experience.  I haven't made anything this bad in a very long time.  Did everything as the recipe directed.  Am basically clueless when it comes to cuts of meat, so I asked the butcher whether it needed to be cut across the grain and was told no.  Don't know if this was the problem, but I'll NEVER buy "skirt steak" ever again.  The meat was like chewing on a tire and there was no flavor to the entire   dish.  Very disappointed in this recipe, but I'm also willing to admit that there could have been operator error!  Won't make this ever again.  Sorry!

Made these tonight! They were a hit. Just the right amount of beef, onions and pepper. The bacon added a really nice flavour   I changed a few things just because I had them on had. Marinated the beef in garlic and fajita sauce for a couple hours. Used yellow pepper instead of green.  Thanks for the recipe and all the other suggestions!

Excellent easy recipe! I used store brand fajita seasoning, frozen fajita veggie blend, precooked bacon strips, dried cilantro, and new york strip thin cut steaks. I made this in my cast iron skillet adding a little vegetable oil since the bacon really didn't add any grease, and the meat cooked up in about 3 minutes. I cooked it until it was still a little pale pink in the middle and then turned the heat off and it was perfect by the time I served it up. I didn't have tomato. This was a big hit here, thanks Rhonda.

Love this recipie!  It's quick - we were eating within 30 minutes.  It's delicious.  It's flexible - you can use what you have on hand.  I used taco seasoning because I didn't have fajita seasoning.  I didn't use the bacon and it was still ole!  I ate mine on a tortilla - I think he ate it right out of the pan it was so good.

Scaled this down, used a strip steak (Angel Food Ministries) to cut up and had a wonderful meal for two. I used salsa on the side instead of the tomatoes. Excellent and quick.

yesssss..i did!!  it was great.. ...but i had tenderized skirt steak and let it sit in a fajita seasoning that comes in a shaker.. not a package or liquid.. cannot tell..but the name.  Had all the good stuff in the ingredients though!! I also added lots of lime juice as well and let it sit awhile.  I like it hot with pepper.. jalapenos,  serranos, green chilies.. any of those are good.  Still MORE lime juice! Make sure the meat is tenderized before and comes like that in the package or you get your butcher to do it, or it will be tough.  let it marinate ..in fridge overnight if you can!

I'm sorry but I followed the recipe EXACTLY and the meat was not chewable.  I'm so disappointed that I trusted the recipe and followed it exactly.

I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe.  Modifications I made:  I put a bit of oil on the tortillas, along with some roast garlic & sea salt, put the mixture on the tortillas and grated the cheese on top.  I put these under the broiler until the cheese was melted and the tortillas were a bit crisp  Delicious.  I would make this once a week.

Made this tonight for dinner and it was VERY good!  I added some extra garlic.  Can't imagine anyone not liking this one if prepared as directed.  My family wants it again this weekend!

There was no flavor to be found. It could have been my preparation but I doubt it. A waste of time and money.
