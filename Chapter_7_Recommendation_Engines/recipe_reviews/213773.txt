Remodeling my kitchen and this was a lifesaver... a quick and easy protein that is not a "dieter's nightmare." It can easily be spiced up with a pinch of your favorite seasonings. I found the cooking spray unnecessary like previous reviewer.

I'm all about ease and not dirtying a lot of dishes.  This was super easy and tasted good.  Forgot to spray the mug with cooking spray, but it was no problem.  Didn't stick.

When I had an accident and was in a wheelchair this recipe was a joy!  In fact, I often still make eggs this way, with cream cheese and some curry powder.

As noted, no veg. spray is necessary.
