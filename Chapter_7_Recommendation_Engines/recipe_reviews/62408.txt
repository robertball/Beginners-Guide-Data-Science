Delicious salad! I lost my recipe and this was almost exact.. did add a green pepper and chopped the veggies in the food processor (except the pimentos). I always get requests to make this so thanks for sharing!

We make this all the time - it is an excellent pasta salad and it is different from most macaroni salads.
The only difference I do is use another cucumber and blend all the ingredients in a blender (except the pimento which I don't use) and pour over the pasta and refrigerate for 24 hours.

Quite tasty but I suggest reducing the onion and garlic powder!

We've made this salad for many years. It's delicious. We put everything (except the noodles, onion, and cucumber) into the blender. Makes it much easier to blend the seasonings with the noodles.

Needed a pasta salad with no mayonnaise for a hot outside going away party.  This fit the bill.  I didn't have a jar of pimentos so I used fresh orange pepper.  Everyone liked it at the party and I kept some at home for lunches.  It went over well at the party and the leftover held up get for packed lunches the following 2 days.  It is a good pasta salad, but I can't figure out what it is missing for me to give it a 5-star rating.  Thanks Jan for sharing.

Love this recipe.  I've been making this salad for 30 years.  So glad to see it on All Recipes so that I can share it with friends.  I've made it in the morning and served it at the evening meal and it was fine.  I would say you need to refrigerate it for at least 8 hours.  
A few time I made it and did not have pimento, so I grated carrot and used that.  Essentially, it just needs something for color.

Wonderful! The only thing I changed was cutting back on the sugar. I used 1 cup instead of 1.5 cups. It was still plenty sweet!

This might have been pretty nice, except that I thought there was way too much dressing, and it was too sweet. At a guess, I would have cut the distilled white vinegar to no more than 1 cup, and the white sugar to even less. I made this exactly as written (using a yellow onion, and a jar of sliced pimentos, because that's how they were sold), and the salad was just way too wet, and it seemed like a waste of ingredients (minor, I know, but proportions matter when judging a recipe).

Delicious!  Recipe makes a little too much liquid, so I added a bit more pasta an it was perfect!  Thanks for sharing!
