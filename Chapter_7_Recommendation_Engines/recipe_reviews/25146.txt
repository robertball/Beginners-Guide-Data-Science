After reading the previous reviews I decided to add the following ingredients: small can sliced black olives, approx. 8 oz. diced pepperoni's, 15 oz. can pepperoni flavored pizza sauce, 1.5 tablespoons diced jalapeno peppers. Put 1 can crescent rolls on bottom of 13x9 pan sprayed with Pam, thin layer of meat, 1 cup mozerella, thin layer of meat, another cup mozerella, no parmesan. Cover with 2nd can of crescent rolls, bake for 25 min. This came out golden and perfect; we will definitely be making this over again and again.

I make this recipe using 2 cups of shredded cheddar cheese instead of the parmesian.  I've also used ground turkey instead of the ground beef, or thrown in some crumbled, browned italian sausage with the ground beef.  Use a 14 ounce jar of pizza sauce instead of the spaghetti sauce (Ragu quick sauce is great).  Mix the brown ground meat with the sauce and one beaten egg (save 1 Tbs of the egg).  I place the meat mixture in the dish and layer the cheeses over it.  Roll the crescent rolls out to completely cover the ingredients, and brush the Tbs. of egg over the dough to get a golden crust.

Great concept-After reading all the reviews I made a few changes.  I cooked a a full box of pasta placed it in the bottom of the pan & mixed it with the sauce.  Baked for 20 minutes. Added shredded mozzarella & more sauce.  Layered croissants and sprinkled with parmesean cheese.  Baked additional 20 minutes... Excellent and filling!  Thanks!

I don't rate it unless I think and know it's five stars all around. My family loved this recipe! What an easy meal and saved me a lot of time!! I added some turkey pepperoni and wished we had more ingredients to add. I will plan to do that next time! This one is a keeper.

I thought that this recipe tasted just like you are eating spaghetti sauce with meat.  I think it needs LESS spaghetti sauce and maybe more crescent rolls?  It did not taste close to an upside down pizza.

I like that it was quick and easy, but I didn't care much for this. Maybe it was the spaghetti sauce I used.  Another problem I had with this is that I could only get one layer of meat sauce in a 9X13 pan.  I would have had to double the meat sauce to make two layers.  It probably would have worked for an 8X8 size pan, but then the cresent rolls would have been too long. On top of all that I had to take some Zantac after eating it.

This is a wondeful dish!  It is very quick, easy and scrumptious!!  To give it a little more pizazz, I added a small jar of sliced mushrooms and a can of artichoke hearts that had been drained and chopped.   For those who like with with a kick, next time I would probably add a dash of tabasco and jalapenos!   Thanks for the great recipe Kim!  : - )

My son and I thought this was really good. I did make some changes to it though after reading other reviews. I used a can of pizza sauce instead of pasta sauce, a can of crescent rolls on the bottom and a can on the top, sliced mozz. cheese (because that's all I had on hand). I melted butter and brushed that on the top crescent roll crust, then sprinkled garlic powder on top and then sprinkled grated parm cheese on top of that. It was really good!

A great basic recipe that you can add to. I added mushrooms, some chopped pepperoni and green pepper, and the Easy Pizza Sauce III recipe I found on this website. I also tried to make it a little less caloric with fat free cheese and low fat crescent rolls.  All in all, we really liked it and will have it again.

This is ok. I like to add a variety of pizza toppings such as green pepper, mushrooms, black olives, etc. This is a good recipe to build on.

Used combo of sausage and hot italian turkey sausage instead of beef. Used double the 2 cheeses and 26 ounce jar of sauce. Added rosemary, basil, oregano, sugar, pepper, salt and cinnamon to the sauce. BF said it was the best thing I'ven made in 2 years. Would put a second layer of dough on the bottom next time (partially bake that layer before adding the ingredients.

I have made a version of this recipe for years, the only difference is add a layer of crescent rolls on the bottom as well as the top and instead of using spaghetti sauce, I use pizza sauce...then add a variety of 'pizza' toppings. I sometimes brush the top crust with a little butter & garlic powder. Tastes much more like pizza that way.  My family always loves it!

I took the advice of some other members here and used 2 cans of the crescent rolls.  Other changes were pizza sauce and added pepperoni to the meat mixture.  I assembled as follow:  sprayed dish with PAM, then put 1 layer of crescent rolls on the bottom, then layer of meat sauce, then 1 cup mozz cheese, and finally 1/2 cup parm.  Repeated layers one more time, then topped with 2nd layer of crescent roll.  On top I brushed with some olive oil, sprinkled with rosemary, garlic powder and parm cheese.  Baked for 25 min.  It was wonderful cheesy pizza goodness.  Thanks for the quick and easy recipe!

Very tasty and fun to make with the kiddos, because they can add whatever their favorite toppings would be.  We did make some changes.  Instead of ground beef we used bulk sausage (1lb Owens regular) this added more of a pizza flavor.  We also added a bit more garlic and Mozzarella cheese and some of the toppings the kids wanted (mushrooms, olives, pepperoni).  As mentioned we did one can of crescent rolls on the bottom as well as the top and it was wonderful.  Baked it as the recipe called for, it was AMAZING.  Have fun with it!!!

This is a very interesting recipe. I did do things a little different though. Pizza sauce is a must and I did use more than called for. I added mushrooms to the sauce and used twice as much cheese. My family loves cheese but I think you need more than what the recipe says. I also used McCormick Pizza Seasoning when browning the meat. My teen-age daughter and her friend liked it alot. It is a recipe that you can modify to what you like to eat on a pizza.

I made a few changes, but by the end of the night there was nothing left of this dish! First instead of spaghetti sauce, I used pizza sauce. I had only one layer of beef at the bottom of the pan, then a layer of cheese, then a layer of pepperoni and more cheese then the crescent rolls. The crescent rolls were so yummy on top of this dish! I will be making this again.

Required some pretty major tweaking but great idea. Added extra veggies and pepperoni. Replaced the ground beef with Italian sausage. Was a huge hit!

This lacked pizzaz.  Maybe I will try again using the additions previous raters suggested.  It was an easy dish to put together but the taste left me wanting for more.

This is simply amazing and so easy!  The possibilities are endless for this recipe; I can't have red sauce because of health problems - I so used alfredo instead and just went to town - adding all the pizza toppings that I would normally use (either ground turkey and pineapple or black olives and ground beef) - this is the first meal that was completely finished by my household eating-wise in about 10 recipes.  Yay!

This is really good hence the reason it gets a 5.   I do feel that the quality of the pasta sauce used does make a difference.  So use one that you feel suits your taste.

I call this "Sadness on a plate" because it's the only way to describe my family's faces before we eventually ordered in. The silver lining is that once we threw out the crescent rolls, we salvaged the meat and sauce. We added a bit more sauce the next night and put it on top of some pasta.

I guess I don't understand the concept of this recipe. Why not just put the toppings....on top?

Made this on quick notice one night.. It was simple and easy.  My 7 year old daughter ate 3 servings, which is HUGE for her.  There were no left overs that night!!!

This is a great jumping off point, and I love that you can tailor it to your tastes or what you have on hand. I used ground turkey and threw in a handful of diced turkey pepperoni. I also added sliced mushrooms, spinach and some shredded zucchini while I was browning the turkey and onions. I seasoned it with basil, oregano, and some crushed red pepper flakes. I had half a jar of leftover spaghetti sauce, so I used that with a 6 oz can of tomato paste. The best part is that my picky 2 year old ate it!

It doesn't get easier than this.  I made this for a quick weeknight meal and it was so good!  Followed everything just as written and turned out great.  Will be making again in the future.

Made this on the fly one night and my hubby ate most of the pan. PIG. I left out the parmasan cheese and used an Italian Blend, and roasted garlic spagetti sauce. It was great for such a quick and easy meal.

I read the reviews and made a couple changes too...  rather than the spgti. sauce, I used a sm cn of plain sauce, sm cn of paste, and a reg. size cn of diced tomatoes that had basil oregano and garlic already added in.  I only used 1/2 the onion and I went with two cans of crescent rolls -one for the top and one for the bottom. Thanks for providing the recipe!

This was a hit with everyone in the family.  I made the version of the recipe that used crust on the bottom and on the top. I used an italian blend shredded cheese and added ingredients that I would put on pizza, including some coarsely chopped pepperoni. I layered mine with crust, cheese, meat mixture, cheese, meat mixture, cheese and crust (with the other ingredients included in the meat layer). I sprayed the top with olive oil and sprinkled with a bit of oregano.

I thought it was great.  I used a 8 x 8 inch pan, with the original recipe.  The only thing I added was the egg wash and sprinkled the dough with Parmesan cheese and garlic powder.  My kids LOVED it.  This will be a regular for sure.  Good one for the kids to help assemble!

To make the sauce taste more "pizza"ish, I added a lot of oregano, it really helped! A layer of pepperoni slices underneath the cheese layers also made it taste much more like pizza. I suggest adding a lot of pepperoni, makes it delicious! Loved it.

At first, like a few other reviews, I saw this as just meat sauce without the pasta; but as I listened to my family who loved it I began to realize how much I really did like it. I have always thought that the pasta was secondary to the sauce and to replace it with a flaky crust is ok by me. I would skip the layering next time though and just pour the sauce all in at once. I did not have jar sauce so I added spices to a can of tomato sauce instead. I would also like to try some other pizza toppings to chunk it up some more. I will be serving this again.

I have a shortcut for this recipe...open a jar of spaghetti sauce and start eating! This was so gross! It was like cooking spaghetti and meatsauce but then deciding you would just eat a plate of sauce!  My husband, who likes EVERYTHING, never said a word about it (good or bad), which means he didn't want to hurt my feelings.  I don't know of any way this could be dressed up or made better, unless you put noodles in with it!

After reading the reviews, I decided to go with pizza sauce and made it a little meatier adding some onions and peppers to the garlic and I also simmered the sauce for a little to enhance the flavors.  Used a second can of crescent rolls for a bottom crust but slightly prebaked it before layering the meat sauce and a combination of mozeralla, Italian, and cheddar cheeses in between the bottom and top crusts. Brushed the top layer with butter and sprinkled a little parmesan cheese on top before baking until golden brown.  Was a huge hit and a great alternative to take out pizza.  Plus there's so many ways to vary the recipe to your tastes! My boys have already asked for me to make it again! Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Super easy dinner! I added some red and orange bell peppers to my meat sauce! Also on top I put rosemary, garlic salt, and shredded Parmesan. However; the shredded Parmesan was rather crunchy so I would suggest grated Parmesan. Really easy though! Thanks for the recipe!

GREAT IDEA!! But.... What about the pizza toppings to make it more like pizza? I would give it 3 1/2 b/c I think the goal here is EASY. But, seriously they totally forgot to add pepperoni.. Also add some normal pizza type spices like oregano, basil, ect.
For this recipe they should have added this:
Add in toppin ideas:
Pepperoni
Black olives
Mushrooms
Green peppers
The recipe by itself is plain and boring thus I gave it 3 stars. Once you add other yummy normal pizza toppings it will taste more like pizza and be delish!!

My daughter made this and it was delicious! She did use her favorite spaghetti sauce- Classico. Which makes me wonder if it would be just as good with the canned brand I was going to use.  Everyone really enjoyed it. My husband said it needed mushrooms and guacamole. I asked him if he was pregnant:)! Thanks for the recipe!

This was a great, family friendly, recipe. As with most "Pizza" recipes, we just added our favorite toppings and it was well received by all, including the kids from the 14month old up to the 6 year old.

With alterations from other reviewers, we enjoyed this.  Double the hamburg, onion and garlic. Add slivers of pepperoni and jalapenos (next time I'll go with bell peppers instead).   When the hamburg is browned, remove from heat. After letting it cool slightly, add 1 beaten egg and then a jar plus a little more of pizza sauce.  Spread the entire mixture across the 13x9 glass baking dish. Cover with LOTS of shredded mozzarella and grated romano.    Covered with the crescent rolls and brush the dough with beaten egg.  The finished product still doesn't have a huge wow factor, but everyone liked it, and it gives us one more way to have ground beef.

Maybe next time I'll add some pepperoni and green peppers or sausage.  It didn't taste pizza-y.  It needed more bread too.  It was like eating meat sauce with Pisbury.

Robin Miller from Food Network had a delicious variation on this.  I make it all the time and I don't need crescent rolls. Look for upside down pizza on foodnetwork.com.

Made this as is except I used 1 1/4 lbs ground beef and added mushrooms. We did enjoy it very much. Was easy to put together. Leftovers reheated really nice in the nuker. My only problem is that it didn't even half fill a 13x9. This should be put into an 11x7 especially if you're only using the 1 pound of meat.

Was not a big fan...if you try this recipe absolutely make sure you spice it up a ton and have fun with it.  Making it as is was not that good.

I'm a vegetarian so I replaced the ground beef with Morningstar Farms® Meal Starters™ Grillers™ Recipe Crumbles™.  I also switched to pizza sauce and added black olives and fresh mushrooms.  This one is definitely a keeper.

My family really liked this recipe. I wasn't too sure about the crescent rolls in this recipe, since I don't usually like them too much in other recipes. But it really worked for this recipe.
I did use a jar of pizza sauce instead of spaghetti sauce. I also added mushrooms, olives, and pepperoni, to suite the tastes for my family. One thing my husband and I want to do next time is to use 2 tubes of crescent rolls. Yummy!!!

I think this a good concept for an interesting dinner. However I would not separate the crescent rolls, i would just unroll the dough over top and bake it like that.

I thought this was exceptionally quick...and tasty.  We added bacon, pepperoni, and canadian bacon.  I also added some pizza seasoning to the sauce.  Mushrooms and green bell pepper would be a nice add in.  I left the onion out though.  Thanks for sharing.

I tried this version. Fabulous.  I did make some changes---I added one chopped green bell pepper, substituted Ragu Pizza Quick sauce (2 jars), and added sliced pepperoni (one package) to the mix.  Forgot cresent rolls, but am sure they are good.  Gets fabulous reviews from all ages. 5-star! Thanks for sharing this.

I made this only after reading all the reviews.  I used what I had left of a jar of Pizza sauce (3/4 of a jar) and only then did I add spaghetti sauce to fufill the remainder of what I needed.  I also added some pepperoni cut into strips to give it more of a pizza taste.  If I'd of had it, I would have used some mushrooms, diced tomatoes, and canadian bacon.  From then on, I followed the remainder of the instructions and ingredients.  My husband and I enjoyed this quite a bit, and I will be making this again.

This was ok.  I used pizza sauce instead of spaghetti sauce.  I also used Bob Evans ground italian sausage instead of ground beef.  I think I would use a different brand of sausage, though.  I don't know if I would make it again.

This was quick and easy, but I thought it was a little bland. Will make again but I'll try and spruce it up with something. I like the idea of adding black olives or mushrooms. I will certainly make this again.

Very easy!  I did think that it needed some spicing up for the adults.  I'll do that next time. I did use the pizza sauce as recommended by others, I think it tasted great. But for kids, I can see why they come running!  I'll definitely make it again!

This was very easy and tasted ok.  However, both my husband and i thought it would be better with more ingrediants that you'd top pizza with (olives, canadian bacon, gr. pepper, etc) to give it more flavor.

I cooked this meal for my family tonignt(of 4). They loved it! I used a veg. spagetti sauce, biscuits(rolled thin)instead of crescent roll,onion powder,and garlic powder(since I didn't have garlic or onions)and it turned out wonderful. Even my 1 year old loved it(ham eater). I will surely cook this again. Thanks

I've used a recipe very similar to this one but I use Ragu Pizza Sauce instead of spaghetti sauce.  You can also add your other favorite pizza toppings below the crust too like pepperoni, green peppers and onions.  It makes for great leftovers too!

This is the first time I've ever cooked supper so quick! It's ideal for families on the go! All you have to do is assemble all the ingredients, pop it in the oven for 25 minutes.........and VOILA!
My kids had a "love at first sight" experience with this dish!

I made this to take to a Superbowl party.  Everyone liked it very much!  I did what a few others did, I put a layer of crescent rolls on the bottom as well as the top. So it was more of a meat pie.  I also used the pizza sauce instead of the spaghetti sauce and added a layer of mushrooms.

I pretty much made the recipe as is except I used an 8x8-inch baking pan. I layered the crescent rolls ... 1/2 can as bottom crust, and 1/2 can as top crust. Made this for an easy dinner for my grand daughters (who can be picky eaters, but they love pizza), and it was a hit.  When I make again for my husband, I will get a bit more creative with extra spices or fillings ( mushrooms, peppers, olives) ... or not.  Yummy as is.

Just awful! Way too much parmigiana cheese. Was more like a canned meat sauce you’d have with pasta. The crescent rolls were the wrong flavor for a “pizza”  crust.

This was a super easy and pretty tasty casserole.  I know, I know I shouldn’t rate things that aren’t made exactly like the recipe, but I only made a few modifications based on other reviews.  I made this with a double crust, one can of crescent rolls on the bottom and another on top of the fillings.  I put the dough in the bottom on my pan, spread some pizza sauce on top and sprinkled with mozzarella cheese.  For the filling, I cooked up some turkey Italian sausage; added some diced onions, green peppers, red peppers, black olives, pepperoni, and mushrooms.  I heated up all the filling and added more pizza sauce and seasonings.  I layer all of the filling on top of the crust, added more mozzarella cheese, then placed a can of crescent rolls on top.   I’m plannng to add this into regular rotation.

This is delicious!  I made it almost exactly as written.  I was short on time so I left the onions out.  I did add the teaspoon of minced garlic(from a jar), added a handful of Italian seasoning, a quarter teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper and about a teaspoon of red pepper flakes.   I used Prego spaghetti sauce with mushrooms because I love the flavor.  I let the meat sauce simmer for fifteen minutes or so.  Also I only made it one layer as there isn’t enough meat sauce for layering.  One generous layer of mozzarella and parmesan cheeses.  I also sprinkled some parmesan cheese over the dough,as another reviewer suggested.  My teenage son couldn’t get enough of it!  Thanks for this great recipe.

I made it exactly per recipe and it was good. Next time I think I will add other pizza toppings such as mushrooms and peppers which could add another star.

I added pepperoni and mushrooms but still thought it tasteless. 
The crescent roll topping didn't taste like pizza dough at all.

Everyone liked it but it was nothing like pizza. It was bad, just nothing to write home about. The kids ate a large piece and so did my husband but none raved and asked me to make it again

made this for dinner tonight, added mushrooms as well, thought about adding green pepper as well, but didn't. We totally loved it and it was super easy to make.  I have a gluten allergy so made a little one on the side for me. Switched out the pilsbury crescent roll topping for gluten free bisquick biscut dough and it worked out well.

I've been eating a similar dish as this since i was a kid, 40+ years ago.  Mom used to use half sausage half beef, and a home made pizza sauce , and topped it with home made corn bread.  That said this recipe is really good as it is.  I made it without any changes and enjoyed it.  

Parmesan Asiago cheese would give it little more flavor.  A good sauce i like for this is half the sauce and half a can or so of salsa ready flavored tomatoes.

I used the mozza only in the recipe, but sprinkled parmesan on top with garlic powder and some brushed on butter.
I really enjoyed this dish - unfortunately I added a can of mushrooms, that were awful and effected the taste. I will make it again with better mushrooms, and probably give it a 5 star. Also I want to add some cooked bacon and pepperoni.

I have been making upside down pizza for years, but my recipe adds a green pepper and onion to the meat, which is not in as thick a layer (probably less sauce), and instead of crescent rolls, you pour what is basically a Yorkshire pudding batter over the mozzarella, then finish with the Parmesan.  Different and much more interesting. Oh - and I usually add an Italian sausage or two, instead of all ground beef, for more flavor.

I added sliced pepperoni to the mixture after browning the beef. If you need to drain the beef after browning it then never add anything like onion, garlic or spices to the beef. That fat you're going to drain will contain most of the flavors of what you're browning the beef with. If the beef has enough fat content that you need to drain it then brown it all by its lonesome. I've never understood why people toss out all of that flavor.

This was pretty good and super simple. I used pizza sauce instead of spaghetti sauce and added some Italian seasoning and some chopped pepperoni, which kept it from tasting like you were just eating pasta sauce with no pasta as another reviewer had mentioned. I think next time I would bulk it up with a ton of veggies too.

I did not enjoy this recipe as written, so I took and ran with the main idea behind it: pizza. I cooked fresh sliced mushrooms and a chopped green bell pepper along with the ground beef/onion/garlic. Then I stirred in 1 can of pizza sauce (instead of spaghetti sauce), some pepperoni, and some black olives. Baked it for 30 minutes and yea! Itsa supreme!

I liked it but I would add more vegetables like mushrooms or peppers.. and some pepperoni.  My husband said it was really good but I think it needs more stuff.  Very easy dish to play with and add things.

Not a bad dish, but does not remind me of a pizza at all.  It seems like a hamburger casserole to me, and bf said it was a "chili bowl".  It is, however, very easy to throw together so a great meal for those nights that you don't have a lot of time or energy.  I added more garlic, seasoned salt, and basil & oregano to spice it up for our tastes.  I think it would have to be changed drastically for me to think of it as pizza like (lose the hamburger, add other pizza toppings like sausage or pepperoni and green peppers, olives, etc.) but as a regular casserole, it's a nice simple meal that can be easily adjusted for ingredients you have on hand.  Thanks for the recipe!

Well,  I thought it was an easy, filling meal with ingredients I had on hand...but my husband told me it was one of the best meals I have ever made!  I used pepper jack, cheddar, and american cheese (what I had in the fridge) and added mushrooms and lots of spices to the ground beef.  I guess it's a keeper.  :)

Was simple to make and really yummy. Only change I made was to make it in an 8 by 8 dish instead of the 9 x 13. It just seemed so thin when I put it in the 9 X 13 so I transfer to the other pan and cooked the same. It was amazing and a sure sign everyone like it was there was nothing left for me to put away at the end of supper

Kinda flavorless and dull. OK for a quick dinner or something to freeze ahead to pull out in a pinch but nothing I'd get excited about.

This was excellent. My whole family loved it and its easy to prepare. I did add a pound of italian sausage crumbled and cooked with ground beef. And I put in several slices of pepperoni cut in half. Also instead of the Spaghetti sauce I use two of the samll jars of Rague pizza sauce. I did a mixture of cheese: some mozzerella, provolone and chedder. It was delicious. Will definintly be one of our regulars.

Really tasty, even though I omitted the onions. I also used shredded parm, not grated. I followed the original recipe otherwise and was pleased with the results. Next time I make it, I'll have to let it cook in the oven longer, because the crescent roll dough was a little too doughy--my fault. I also like adding some seasoning and extra cheese on top of the crust. Very easy and kid-friendly meal, I would think.

MY hubby loved it!  I used the original recipe--just trying something different with ground beef.  One thing I did do differently is that I put the crescent rolls at the bottom of the dish to create a stuffed pizza.  Next time, we said that we'd put some of our fav pizza toppings inside.  This dish would also be great and easy for your potluck you may have at work.

Yummy but made a few changes due to other comments here. Used pizza sauce instead of spaghetti sauce. I made this for a crowd so I used italian sausage, double the amount of ground beef and some chopped up pepperoni. Everyone loved it.

I rate this a 3 because there was nothing wrong with the dish, but I wouldn't make it again.  My husband picked at it and I had too much left over.  It wasn't anything special.  However, it was easy to prep ahead of time and heat up for dinner.

There were some very mixed reviews from the family, but I enjoyed it.  I put pasta on the bottom, used colby jack cheese, mixed a beaten egg in the meat sauce with a tbsp being used to brush on top of the crescent rolls.  I used the Easy Pizza Sauce I from this site for the sauce.

This is one of my family faves since we tried it.  Tonight is our second time and everyone loves it!  I love changing up the "toppings" up each time we make it and I even made it with sausage instead of ground beef this time..even BETTER!!  Easy, fast and YUMMY!

Good idea for a quick and easy meal.  I added Italian seasoning to the beef as it browned and pepperoni slices just because it seemed like the thing to do, but the basic recipe lends itself to being used as a starting point for whatever your family might like in a pizza.  (Mushrooms?  Olives?  Peppers?)  I think I might try it with Italian sausage the next time.

I only gave this 3 stars because my kids turned their noses up at it. I didn't care for it either but my husband liked it.

It was decent, but I didn't follow much of the actual recipe (I did as others suggested and added my own fixings, less sauce, and another layer of rolls on top)

Good recipe.  My family really enjoyed it.  I did include chopped green peppers which I sauted with the onions.  Also chopped a large can of med size black olives and added to the mix.  They gobbled it all up.

This was the first recipe my husband actually told me to save in the cookbook and make again and the best part is the kids love it!  I add a can of chopped spinach to the meat and sauce mix and then put some fresh sliced mushrooms on the first layer.  I also substitute cheddar cheese and omit the parmesan.  Definately a winner!

I used pizza sauce instead. Next time I will use sausage and olives and skip the hamburger.

I only rated this 4 stars because as it is written it is pretty good but with suggestions made by other reviewers it turned into a 5 star recipe.  I added more garlic, mushrooms, and I should have added some green pepper.  Whatever you like on your pizze throw into this dish along with some more seasoning.  I also used pizza sauce instead of the spaghetti sauce and that was a big plus.

This was really good, it just needs more ingredients. Next time I am going to put more pizza like toppings in it and add one more can of crecent rolls to make the crust a little thicker. thanks for the recipe!

A tasty and easy recipe.  I made a few minor changes to the recipe by using pizza sauce instead of spaghetti sauce, and I also added a can of sliced olives to the hamburger mixture.

Well I had high hopes for this recipe. It was ok. I used the basil and oregano tomato sauce and added garlic. This tastes more like pasta then pizza. Not sure how it got that name. But I think with some more spices and less meat it'd be better. My picky 3 yr old actually ate it, so that says something!

This was so quick and easy....great for a weeknight meal.  My kids loved this (and hubby too) so much that I'll need to double it next time!  I used the Easy Pizza Sauce III, (as another reviewer suggested) threw in some turkey pepperoni, 2 cups of mozzarella, and 1/2 cup shredded parmesan. (and reduced fat crescent rolls)  No leftovers!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was great! I altered this recipe a great deal but it was a good basic recipe. I used mozzerella, pepperoni, green pepper, onion, and pizza sauce instead of spaghetti sauce. I used one can of crescent roll dough. Next time I will use 2 cans of crescent rolls. One on top and one on the bottom layer so that we can pick it up to eat it. Of course then it won't be an upside down pizza but it will still be good. Thanks so much. This is a keeper=)

Another great weeknight dinner.  It is simple and easy to make.  I recommend adding pizza toppings such as olives, onions, peppers, and mushrooms as your family likes.  It is very child friendly and takes no time at all to make.

I was surprised by the lack of flavor.  It was easy to make, just a disappointment to me.  It tasted more like spaghetti than like pizza.  I might try it again after playing around with the recipe.

Great recipe.  Family loved it.  I made a couple of changes.  From looking at previous reviews I added pizza sauce instead of spahgetti sauce.  Also added sliced mushrooms and diced green peppers.  Will make again.  Next time I think I will also put cresent roll on the bottom to hold everything together.

This recipe was very easy and delicious.  This is similar to a recipe that my mom used to make that I have been searching for.  Thank you for sharing!

8/16/11 - just made this again and put a can of crescent roll on the bottom and another can on top.  Also, used the butter flavor crescent rolls.  Made a fantastic recipe even better..

If you like a meat sauce, then this is the recipe for you. It was ok, but not the greatest meal. It seemed to be missing something, like potatoes or pasta.

Very very good and extremely easy.  I added more "pizza type toppings" to the meat mixture.  It's a huge hit with my three year old daughter and niece.

This recipe sounded good.  I gave to my family (4).  No one like it.  It tasted more like spaghetti than anything else.  Maybe if pizza sauce and other stuff was added.

VERY EASY!  Pretty tasty - just need to find a good spaghetti sauce, next time (yes- were having it again) I'll try my homemade spaghetti or pizza sauce!

This recipe is awesome. Instead of jar spaghetti sauce, I used Chef-Boy-Arde Spaghetti sauce in the can. My husband ate 2 full helpings. I even went back for more. I will make this over and over again.

THis recipe sounded really good, but wasn't. Maybe a different sauce would make it better.

My very picky fiance loves it, it has all of his favorites, beef, cheese and cresents. It is also something I would even eat.
