I really like this recipe with these changes: use a 10x13 pan. Increase corn meal to 1-1/2 cups. I also like to add a few TBS of butter to the mix, but not necessary. 

Add 1 cup of black olives to meat mixture and put cheddar cheese into the meat mixture. Let meat simmer for 15 minutes before putting it into pan. (I also add a bit more tomato sauce because of the simmer time) We also like it spicier so I increase the chili pepper to taste. Also add 2 tsp sugar or splenda.

Put meat mixture into empty pan and top with the corn meal mixture. Bake as directed.

This is a good basic recipe, but I customized it quite a bit!  First, I used 1 lb. ground beef, and sauteed it with the onions, bell peppers, and 3 cloves of garlic plus salt & pepper. Then I added one can of rinsed black beans, about 2/3 cup of frozen corn kernels, and instead of the tomatoes and chili seasonings I substituted one small (15 oz) can of mild enchilada sauce.  I also added a small can of sliced black olives. The enchilada sauce gives this dish a lot more flavor!

This recipe is too bland and all Tamale pie recipe's need either black olives or green stuffed olives to add some pazzaz! We used creamed corn  CUMIN and CHILLI Pepper to taste!

5 stars with changes of coarse. I cooked this in my cast iron skillet so I could just use 1 pot. I sauteed my onion and garlic and then added my groud sirlion with 1 packet of taco seasoning. I drained 2 cans of rotel and put it in my food processor until it was smooth. I added this to my beef mixture. After this simmered for awhile, I added 1 can of kidney beans with jalapenos and 1 can of mexi-corn, we like spice! So I added 2 chipotle peppers that were in adobo sauce. I previously made bean and cheese "tamales" using Sandra Lee's recipe from Food Network. So I used her corn meal recipe: 2 cups yellow corn meal, 1/2 stick butter softened, 1 chicken stock, 1tsp baking powder. Mash up the butter in the corn meal, add stock and BP. I added, salt, pepper and chili powder as well. This was the perfect amount to spread over the beef/bean/corn mixture. Spread it evenly so it creates a perfectly thin layer. I spread the corn meal mixture over and baked 350 for 20 minutes and then sprinkled cheese on top and let bake 10 more minutes. This was so good. I must add that I did add a few sprinkles of corn meal to my filling because it was a little too mushy & watery. So if you have that problem just add corn meal or flour.

I really like Tamale Pie and I had a very good recipe that got lost when I moved. Add some black olives to this recipe and it will get 5 stars.

I must admit-I was VERY disappointed with this recipe. I hadn't made this recipe for several years, and forgot which one I had used in the past. I noticed some people made comments about the amount of water. I'm assuming that must be the problem. After 35 minutes of baking as instructions said, I ended up with beef filling inside a bunch of cornmeal mush. I was only able to salvage this by baking my own cornbread, removing as much filling as possible, and serving that over the cornbread as a crust. I would not suggest trying this unless someone can properly correct the proportions.

A great basic recipe! Instead of the meat I sauteed 1lb tofu in soy sauce & paprika to taste & also put in some sliced mushrooms. Didn't have any chili powder so we used garlic salt and some fresh ground black pepper. When I do it again I'll double the amount of corn meal & water and maybe add some fresh garlic.

Yum... Using the recipe for inspiration I did make the following tweaks.   I added some cumin, black beans along with drained corn,  subbed hot salsa for the tomato sauce, a small can of diced green chili's for the bell pepper and I used two boxes of corn bread mix which I divided for both top and bottom crust.  Baked at 375 for about 25 min. in a cast iron skillet; added cheese & baked until melted.   I didn't get the mushy crust some complained of.   My guys liked it with sour cream on top!  :)

We were very disappointed in this recipe. It was soggy, unflavorful and the cornmeal did not make this recipe. It ended up being mush and would not form. I would not reccomend this for anyone. Sorry~

Most of this dish was fine except I think I was expecting the cornmeal to end up more like breading instead of mush.  Perhaps I did something wrong?  But I think to get a real cornbread texture you'd have to add oil, egg, etc.  I loved the filling so next time I will do that and just use a cornbread mix to spread on top.

I love tamale pie. This version wasnt for me, cooked as directed came out more like tamale soup. Very watery and not much flavor.  Since im only a beginer-intermediate i followed directions very closley. Very hot in the directions doesnt mean much, should be simmer till almost all liquid is gone. I also think the cornmeal should be baked before adding the stuffing to make it more "waterproof". I did like (being a guy) the heavy beef proportion to the amount of cornmeal. Will tweak and try again. WHOO HOO!

I did not care for this recipe at all.  I know I'm not that good at cooking but I can follow a recipe and when it was done it was like soup and the cornbread part never cooked.  Use the modifications other people have posted that had success because following the recipe does not work.

I used a small can of green chillies instead of green pepper and I used a tablespoon of taco seasoning for one of the two tablespoons of chilli powder. The family loved it! Easy to do!

This recipe was not nearly as good as I hoped. Like other reviewers, my husband and I found this to be BLAND! Also the bottom of the "crust" was very soggy. This recipe has a ton of potential but will need a great deal of modification.

IMHO this was terrible.  Too much corny stuff, not enough meat and flavor.  My husband hated it, and I ate it because it was there.  Maybe I just don't like cornmeal as much as I thought I did.

This is on the right track, but isn't quite right. The picture makes it look great, but if you read the review that goes with it, you discover the crust pictured is a completely different recipe all together. The "crust" in this recipe is mushy and flavorless, better eaten in a bowl.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was just ok. The meat filling was really tasty but the cornbread topping was not good at all. It was a good starting point for me, being my first tamale pie. Thank you for sharing the recipe.

Iuse this to help remind of some of the function of meal. grandma made.  This is good recipe, HOWEVER, I did change a few things. 1. yellow corn (put in skillet warm and stir till thick)  2. corn meal on bottom (cooked for 10 mins - let cool then add the meat or tufu) * box directions.  Now Grandma touch added 2 TSP of white sugar to meal and I 1tsp of oil (any kind) to mix. Measure meal so have even top and bottom dontworry about thin look it will thicken.  Enjoy Smooches.

I was disappointed with this recipe. The corn meal mush never cooked into a crust.. it stayed mushy even after cooking it for nearly an hour. The filling was very good but the mushy cornmeal mixture took away from that. I will probably make the filling again but do something else for the crust.

Guess what I really want is a Mexican Casserole served OVER cornbread not as part of the recipe.  So that is what we did.  Changed some spices to personal tastes and added ripe olives.  Served sour cream on the side.
WITH MY CHANGES give this 4 stars and will make again.  Not a true rate & review of THIS recipe, but see that others didn't like mushy cornbread either.

I liked this recipe overall but I do have to agree with many of the other reviews that the cornmeal is a bit too much mush for my enjoyment. I even used about a third less than the recipe called for and put it in the oven to bake while I was making the filling. My husband also said he'd prefer if the cornmeal was a bit more sweet and not so bland. So yes I'll use this recipe again but I will probably leave out the bottom part of the cornmeal and just put it on the top with the cheese.

This was a great recipe to start with.  My family enjoyed it as is, but I'd like to play with it a little to get a more "tamale taste".  I'm wondering if using masa instead of white cornmeal will work.  My only issue with the original recipe is that the cornmeal part was a little bland, and it did not fit in a 2 qt. casserole dish. Needed a bigger one.

I found this version of Tamale Pie a little bland and very watery which I attribute to adding the canned corn undrained.  Next time I would definately drain the corn and add some chopped jalepenos or maybe a dash or two of cayenne pepper to spice it up a bit.

Please read the reviews! The cornmeal mush just sinks into the “pie” part and never cooks! Something quite wrong about the instructions. I turned it into chili at least, thickened by the cornmeal leftover from me scooping up the cornmeal glop.

This is a keeper! The only changes I made were to drain the corn, used canned diced tomatoes (and their juice) in place of the tomato sauce and used sliced black olives instead of the green peppers. I would like to find a way to give the corn meal base a little more body, but will definitely make this again.

Great flavor. Disappointed that the bottom crust was runny. Used salsa instead of tomato sauce.

Started with the basic recipe and like all aspiring cooks I made the following changes: 1lb. meat combined lean turkey and beef, Used 1/2 Maui onion, 1/2 each green and red pepper, Used Keugers tomatoes with chills instead of tomato sauce, added 2 tbsp tomato paste, doubled chili powder to 4 tbsp. and used cheddar
and pepper jack cheese. this really added flavor but not a lot of heat . Next time I make this I think I'll use less cooked corn meal on the bottom and add more to the top.  Thank you Teri for inspiring me.

I made two minor changes. Omitted the cheese and added 1/2 cup diced olives. It was good and I and my 5 yr old daughter enjoyed (surprise!) it but not amazing to me. It lacked complexity of seasoning flavor... the chili was dominant, I will probably try to find one that I love... but might make it again, an ordinary pie to me.

I haven't actually made this yet but have been reading the reviews. I plan on using yellow polenta for the crust, not white cornmeal. I agree Tamale Pie needs big fat black olives.  Also, before I pour on the polenta topping, you might want to lay down slices of pepper jack cheese and then pour the polenta over the casserole.  Polenta will firm up and set very well.  Just a thought!

I've been cooking for 40 years and I gotta tell you this was the worst tamale pie recipe I have ever tried. Turned out like a bowl of mush and wouldn't NOT recommend it to anyone. Sorry

Family enjoyed this recipe. I changed the recipe for smaller amount and used a pork roast. Taco bell mild sauce for the tomatoe base but still added the chili powder. Just quicker for an easy dinner on busy nights

Ok as a jumping off point, but needs a little something else.  "Tamale" part of the pie was too bland.  I changed it the second time and use yellow cornmeal w/ a cornbread recipe and the kids loved it!

This is a hearty meal that needs a little pep. Add chili flakes, salsa, and roasted chili peppers to add more flavor. Also go heavy on the cheese. Not a bad base recipe.
