These are Cannelloni shells rather than Manicotti Shells (Manicotti are definitive pasta tubes which are stuffed while Cannelloni are round, flat pasta or crepes rolled around filling).  They turned out absolutely PERFECT though and I would highly recommend as these are so much easier to use than store-bought manicotti shells which always tear on me during the boiling process and are a pain in the butt to stuff.  Not only that, these are tasty, foolproof, and uses ingredients one always has on hand.  I used my smallest (6") non-stick frying pan, wiped with an oiled paper towel between 1/4 cupfuls of batter, tipping the pan immediately after pouring to get the batter evenly over the bottom of the pan and form perfect circles.  After about 15 seconds I turned them over for another 10-15 seconds, took them out and put on waxed paper until ready to use. I used the filling and sauces from the "Manicotti Alla Romana" from this site (which I refer to as Cannelloni when using these batter shells), excellent!  These are also awesome using a tiny bit of extra water and 1/8 cupful batter for crepes, this is a great recipe.

If you want a quick and easy Manicotti shell...this is the recipe to use! I wanted to make homemade Manicotti shells since I always used dry tubes that would split right open when I filled them. These came out perfect. I used less batter in the pan though. I like a paper thin Manicotti shell. I also used Non-Stick cooking spray instead of butter and no need to cook both sides, they are perfectly fine cooked on 1 side!

This was a very easy recipe.  I made it wheat free by using gluten free flour in replace of the other flour.  It still worked great, and now my daughter can eat them too!

LOVE! Never buying shells again. So easy. Followed another reviewers suggestion and added 1 cup water and 1 cup 2% milk. Used a generous pinch of Kosher Salt, added granulated garlic and whisked. Used 8" pan that I sprayed with Canola Oil Spray and wiped with a paper towel. Made large "shells" (1/3 cup at a time) and then stuffed them with Cottage Cheese (low fat Knudson), parmesan and fresh white Italian cheese mix (bagged) chopped fresh basil, granulated garlic, onion powder, parsley, oregano, salt and pepper. Beat the Cottage Cheese mixture with a whisk so it would resemble Ricota (hiding ingred. from hubby). Mixed roasted veggies in with the cheese. Wrapped each Shell like a burrito and placed in a layer of sauce. 9 X 13 glass pan - sprayed with cooking spray. Covered all with sauce and cheese. So So Good! Posted two pix of my efforts. Hubby ate 1/2 the pan. DEFINITE KEEPER!

Perfect recipe, Diane!
I used this for making Cannelloni shells in a 7" fry pan. As you get down towards the end, you may need to add a bit of water. The longer it sits, the thicker it gets. Don't bother looking for another recipe, though. This is the one!

This recipe is MOST DEFINATELY Manicotti shells.  As a 2nd generation Italian with relatives from Sicily, Naples and Calabrese, believe me these are it.  I use club soda instead of water though, but either way wonderful!!!

Quick and easy.  I did change a couple of things.  I used seltzer instead of water.  After everything was mixed, I then ran the mixture through a seive and refrigerated for an hour.  I used vegetable spray instead of butter in the fry pan.  A couple minutes on each side at low heat is all it takes.

These manicottie shells turned out great! I didn't have a griddle so I just used a frying pan (they looked more like pancakes but tasted like manicottis). I added ingredients and folded the shells in, put pasta sauce over the top and baked for 40 minutes. Everyone loved them! Great recipe!

Authentic manicotti, just like the ones I ate in Italy.
These are a lighter noodle than cannelloni which is pasta, wrapped around rollers, then boiled.
These are supposed to be between a crepe and a noodle.  Crepes have a milk base
For a thin monicotti just add a little more water to this recipie.

These were good but very unpasta like. More like a crepe. I will probably keep as a crepe recipe though.

Actually, manicotti shells in stores are not for manicotti. THOSE are the cannelloni shells. My great great grandma made these crepe-like pancakes for manicotti and she was straight from Sicily. I am proud to see true italian cuisine starting to show up.

Wow!  I've never made manicotti shells before, and these were delicious!  At first I thought they would be too thick, but they turned out perfectly.  I filled them with a spinach ricotta filling and topped them with homemade marinara sauce, baked them for 20 minutes and enjoyed them thoroughly! :)

This recipe saved my dinner tonight! I was making manicotti with store bought shells, and they completely fell apart halfway through my filling them. I had luckily saved this recipe as a "to try" for later. I had to switch gears in the middle of cooking and make a batch of these. I made exactly as written, except I halved the recipe because I only needed enough to finish filling my pan. They came out great! Obviously a different texture than the shells, and as previously stated, it is a cannelloni shell rather than manicotti, but barely a difference in taste. Thanks DianeW for this! I think I will stick to only using these in the future, and avoid the complete frustration that goes along with trying to stuff manicotti shells!

Thank you for posting this recipes.  I used the "shells" to make the Manicotti Alla Romana (also on this site) for a dinner party and it made the dish beyond 10 stars.  I had made that recipe once before using store bought shells and it was 5 stars (because the filling and sauce combination is so good) but these pancake-like shells put it over the top.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.

Really simple to make and very tasty. From another reviewer I used the 1/4 cup in a 6" non-stick and it was perfect with just a light spray of oil. 
Makes enough for two full 9x13 pans.

These worked very well!  They are similar to crepe shells, but just with more egg (at least my crepe recipe).  I use a smaller round pan (maybe 6 or 7" skillet) and wait until it gets hot on the burner.  I like to pick it up off the burner when I am pouring the batter so that I can roll the batter around to get thin, full coverage in the pan.  It takes a little practice at first.  I usually find that I spray the first one and end up throwing the first one away because it never turns out well.  Then, I usually don't have to spray the pan any more after that and they come off fine.  I like to have the stove between medium and medium high because the process goes more quickly.  You have to really watch them, but they usually start pulling away from the pan on the first side in a minute or two and are ready to be flipped.  I like to at least flip them and give the second side a little color, although I don't leave them on the stove on the second side for as long.  I ended up making a ricotta cheese filling, which is more of what I think of as manicotti, to go inside and I ended up with too little filling.  Next time I'll double my filling recipe, but these were great and I'll definitely use this recipe again!

I've used this recipe for many years.  I mix all the ingredients in the blender and then let it sit for about 30 minutes before I use it.  Perfect filled with a mixture of ricotta, Parmesan, eggs, and parsley and baked with sauce.

This recipe is so good. Although it does make a lot of shells. I made a meal for 4 people and ended up halfing the recipe because it made so much. Overall I loved it and will make this recipe again.

Good recipe.  I gave it 4 stars because I had to make a change.  I remember my mother  adding milk to her manicotti shells, so I added 1 cup water and 1 cup of milk, making it more like a "crepe". This recipe doubles nicely.

This is soooo good.  I made this for a couple of friends the other night and they absolutely raved about them.  You can literally do anything with these.  Sweet or savory.  Super easy to work with.  I had a few left over (made about 16) so I am going to make a chicken stuffing today.  Thank you for sharing.

I've tried several crepe recipes and this one turned out excellently! I made manicotti and it's just so much easier making your own shells than trying to stuff those tubular pasta noodles. So good and thank you!

These are really good!! I buttered them and sprinkled brown sugar and cinnamon for a snack and  also ate them like burritos with chile and it was delicious both ways. I have a smaller frying pan and it yielded 16 shells.

As for the recipe - I use a 6" fry pan and flip the crepe to heat both sides.   Separate each crepe with wax paper and refrigerate if not preparing right away.

I agree that these are a little crepe-like, but once baked they work perfectly!  And they were really simple!

I've made these twice now. I use a 8-1/2" skillet, dip a 1/4 cup measure of batter and swirl in the skillet (like a crepe)I have a plate waiting and put shells between waxpaper while hot. Both times it's made 20 shells. These are so much better than store bought. Even the next day they're not soggy. Pretty much fill em with whatever you want, and same with the sauce you pour over it. This is a company pleaser. You wont be disappointed.

Wow these were really good. My family loved them especially my husband. I got 13 large shells out of this recipe I don't think I will ever buy shells again. This was so much easier and quicker then the shells. I filled mine with ricotta, mozzarella, Parmesan, spinach, garlic powder, onion powder and Italian seasoning. Topped with sauce and mozzarella cheese. Baked them at 350 for 20 minutes and they came out perfect!

Great recipe and easy to make! Kinda like making pancakes. Not too much work and definitely worth the trouble!  Btw, if you do this you will notice the HUGE difference between fresh pasta and store bought.  Melts like butter in your mouth.  Thanks:)

These were the bomb! Tender and sooo much better than store-bought shells.  I cut the recipe in half and it made 8 shells.  No modifications needed on this recipe.  Thank you Diane!

It took a couple of tries to figure out (likely since I'd started at 11pm and had had two glasses of wine), but once I did these shells were amazingly easy.  I wasn't sure if they would have the same texture and flavor of regular pasta and was pleasantly surprised to find that they didn't.  These shells are BETTER than regular pasta: more delicate and excellent flavor. 

Next time (and there will DEFINITELY be a next time!) I'm going to add finely chopped fresh herbs to the shell batter and likely go with a gentler sauce -- I whipped up my own red sauce to cover these once they were filled, and while that was delicious with the three-cheese and meat filling, I'm anxious to experiment!

So fun, so delicious.  My mother passed her "cook crown" to me upon eating these.  Thank you DianeW!!!

Oh wow, these were so excellent.  We stuffed them with chicken and cottage cheese (my kids aren't big on ricotta) and some mozza cheese and some other seasoning. Put a little sauce under and a little sauce over,as well as mozza over. We covered in tin foil and baked 40 min. My entire family loved it - even my fussy 5 yr old...and that is saying something. This is something we will be making again and again!

So easy to make and easier to stuff. We preferred these to store bought shells for the homemade appeal. They are more like crepes than pasta.

I never made manicotti shells and I will never buy them again. These cook faster than it takes for the water to boil for the boxed shells and the tasted great and super easy to fill. Thanks will use from now on.

Very good.  I use these noodles when I make Manicotti Alla Romana from this site.  When making these, I found it easiest to use a griddle instead of a skillet.  Much easier to flip.  Also, when you pour the batter onto the griddle, use the back of the spoon to spread it around and make it as thin as possible, otherwise it can end up too thick and bready/doughy.  Thinner is definitely better!  Give them a try!

We love these for stuffed shells.  When I made these I poured too much batter in the pan and they were a little thick, but still tasted great.  I will not buy shells to stuff anymore, this was much tastier and easy to prepare.

This is the best way to make pasta shells! No boiling and no splitting. The only difference between this recipe and the recipe I have used for years is that I use 1.5 cups of flour and 1.5 cups of water. The rest is the same. Don't overbeat the batter, it shouldn't be frothy. Then let it stand in the fridge for 30 minutes or overnight. Make sure the pan is nice and hot and well-greased (I use margarine), then swirl the batter quickly to coat the bottom. Grease the pan between shells, and they should just fall out when you turn it onto a cooling rack. No flipping required. Stack them between wax paper when cool and they're really easy to handle. They freeze well this way too. I usually get just over 20 shells.

I agree with other reviewers who say they will never buy manicotti shells at the store again. These really are that good! I ended up with 20 7in. shells that I filled with the Manacotti Alla Romana found on this site. They were easy to make, didn't break when filling, and tasted fantastic. The recipe as is says it serves 4 but I ended up with two 9 x 13 pans of manicotti, 10 shells in each pan.

Its by far easier to roll the filling in the shells, but they didn't really turn out to have a pasta like taste.  They were still good though.

Quick & easy!  Stuffed with mozzarella, ricotta, spinach and shredded parm.  I actually saved leftover shells and cooked on stovetop with a little butter for a few min. on each side.  Meanwhile I made a quick mix of ricotta, parm and mozz. cheeses with a little bit of parsley.  Put it on top of shell in pan folded over and cooked on each side for a min. or so. Topped with heated spaghetti sauce and mozzarella.  Served it to a 4 yr old and he loved it!!  So easy and fast.

I was nervous about this recipe, but it worked out really well actually.  I played around with the size of the pour until I got it right.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

These turned out wonderful!  Next time I will half the recipe- the amount in the recipe as given made too many for me.  I also used a 7-inch non-stick fry pan with a little cooking spray with great results. Filled these with a spinach cheese filling and they baked up so nice and tender; not mushy at all.  Time to find some new manicotti fillings to use with these!  Thanks for posting this recipe.

Very easy to make, and tasted great!  I like this method of making manicotti much better than the boil and fill the slippery shell variety.  It's nice to be able to whip these up at a moments notice and not have to worry about having shells on hand.  Thanks!

Outstanding and so easy to prepare. I used a small teflon fry pan, and they turned out uniform crepes. 
I don't think I'll buy store-bought manicotti shells again !!

I'll never use store bought manicotti shells again! Very easy to make. I've only used this for chicken and spinach manacotti can't wait to try cheese filled or even as a dessert shell.

This IS the best recipe for authentic traditional manicotti shells!!!!!!  My great grandmother and family from Italy made them this way. They are the same as cannelloni shells, but they aren't like the store bought kind. Traditional manicotti and cannelloni shells should be like a delicate pasta, vs. the firm round tube from the grocery These are different from crepes, which often have more flour and some sugar.  Cannelloni is typically filled with a very fine ground meat and spices and baked in a bechamel sauce, although there are other options for cannelloni.  Manicotti is filled with ricotta cheese and baked in red tomato sauce.
  
 Be sure to heat a good nonstick crepe pan very slowly. This is key! The first one most often is tossed out but the rest will be perfect.  Cook on one side.  Also, you can let the batter sit refrigerated for an hour or more before making the shell. This helps the batter set. 

Wax paper works best between shells, which can be further wrapped in clear plastic wrap and freezer bags. These freeze nicely. The person who says these aren't manicotti shells is mistaken.  One can't argue with  over 100 years of Italian cooking tradition.  Enjoy!!!

This was a nice change from regular dried manicotti noodles.  I used this with the Manicotti Alla Romana recipe which is one I have made many of times.  The texture was nice with these.  With the extra pasta I put cream cheese and jelly like a crepe and heated for breakfast the next day.  Can you also put eggs and a protein and wrap that way as well.  I will make these again.

These were just ok. Like another reviewer said they were very crepe-like. Might make them again if I was in a pinch. I stuffed them with maicotti and baked baked them. Turned out better than I expected, but still not as good as regular manicotti shells. I'll probably just make lasagna roll ups next time.

fun to make if you like to hang out in the kitchen.  These are pretty different than the dry noodle manicotti you can buy off the shelf at the grocery store.  Imagine a cheese-filled crepe baked in tomato sauce.  It’s really good but very different from any manicotti I’ve ever had!

Excellent - so much better than store bought pasta shells!  Only changes were to use 1/2 tsp salt and to substitute one cup milk for one cup of the water.   I used a 7" pan, 1/4 cup batter, and cooked on medium-low heat for 35-45 seconds.  Cooking on just one side worked fine.

Just like my mother in law Abruzzi Italy.  These are what I ate in Italy.  I never had any boxed pasta anywhere I ate Italy all homemade.  Always went to small restaurants.  Try these you will not be disappointed.

These were absolutely wonderful!  I made them in a small pan, as other had suggested.  1/4 made them a little thick, in the end; I think that next time I'll use less for thinner shells.  Otherwise, this was perfect!  Super easy - if you can make pancakes, you can make these, no problem!!!  Husband- and children-approved!!!

First time out and I must say pretty amazing. Thank you .
I took the advise of a poster below and substituted one cup of water for one cup of skim milk. This one is a keeper.

These are awesome. Of course they're not like your average pasta, they're homemade. I love them them stuffed with ricotta and smothered in homemade sauce and mozzarella!!!

I loved these Cannelloni (as Christina B wrote) shells.  They are not true "manicotti" tubes...but I like them so much more!!  They were so easy to make but I needed to use a little bit more water (couple tablespoons) than stated in the recipe in order to be able to swirl them on a flat non stick ten-inch Nordic Ware crepe pan.  I got over a dozen ten inch wrpappers.  They are truly somewhere between a crepe and a pasta.  My mother, while she liked them, prefers "real" pasta tubes but I really like these more.  They're not as heavy as true pasta and you don't have to boil them!!  If I ever make these for just me I'll definitely use this recipe again!!  Thank you so much for this recipe, DianeW.

Love these. I use them for lasagne, so much easier than boxed dry lasagne, tastes better too, and I can make them to size. I also use them for the noodles in chicken noodle soup, I just make them thicker for that. They really hold their shape well, dont fall apart in recipes, and so v

I have made this recipe for over 30 years. I HATE those hard shells you buy. They are tough and hard to eat. These are so tender, you will never go back to those other ones.  I spray my pan after each one with Pam and works great as they slide right out. I have also made pasta and rolled them out (#4 setting on hand crank pasta machine)in oblong sheets, cutting them to the size I needed. Stuffing goes in, roll, place face down on a sauced bottom casserole, top with sauce and mozzarella. My stuffing is my Nana Ortenzi's recipe of Meatloaf mix, Ricotta(NO ITALIAN ever uses cottage cheese!), Chopped spinach, eggs, Mozzarella.

These were odd to make because I thought they would be more like manicotti shells, but they turned out great! I stuffed them with cheeses, sausage and spinich topped with marinara. Yum! Easy and delicious.

Surprised at the flavor and texture, very good and mimics a noodle pretty good. Super fast and much easier to fill than a pre shaped noodle. My only caution...make sure to cook them on very low heat...we had some that slightly browned, that was not desirable. Great recipe anyone can make in a flash.
