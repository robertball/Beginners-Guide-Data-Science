Loved, loved, loved this stir fry.  I added a combination of fresh and frozen veggies I had on hand (broccoli, bean sprouts, snap peas, baby carrots), and a little bit of sugar and terriyaki to the soy sauce.  I mixed the soy sauce and terriyaki sauce together in a jar (along with the bit of sugar I added), and then added as much as I thought the dish needed, with a little bit left over for next time.... The flavor was awesome, and it was very filling.  I will definitely make this again!!

very tasty! chopped vegetables seem like quite a lot but gets all eaten up!!
I substiuteted sugar snap peas for asparagus as I am not a fan of asparagus. In fact, I made everything in one skillet. Cooked rice, set aside. toasted sesame seeds after quickly cleaning the skillet, set aside and finally stir fried the veggies. Thanks for the recipe.

My kids even liked it.  I like to use short cuts during the week so I bought pre packaged stir fry vegetables in the veggie section.  I also use a rice cooker.  You can use chicken broth in it instead of water and it's easy without having to watch over it.  You can use just about any veg combo and it will be great.  Good recipe.

This should get the most die-hard vegetable haters to eat their vegetables and love ‘em.   I cooked the rice in butter, not margarine, and made the sesame seed thing easy on myself by using the already toasted variety. I deliberately omitted the ginger root, as I detest it as some folks do cilantro - purely a subjective thing.   I made no changes to the vegetables called for, although so many would be equally as suitable.  I finished it with a dab of butter and a squeeze of  fresh lemon juice.  I enjoyed this immensely.

Asparagus is expensive at $4.99/lb so I substituted Eating Right's pre-packaged Broccoli Stir Fry (with includes carrots, snap peas, and broccoli florets). This is my second attempt to cook a stir fry dish. The first recipe I tried was Robin Miller's (from Food Network's quick and easy meals). It was decent, nothing spectacular. But wow, this dish is richer and more flavorful, thanks to awesome combination of sesame oil and sesame seeds (adds a a nice texture and leaves a nutty lingering taste). I made a few modifications gleaned from other recipes I researched: I added about 1.3lb of boneless, skinless chicken breasts. I cut into 1 1/2 inch strips, placed it in a zip lock bag, and tossed with 2 tbsp. of cornstarch (. In a separate bowl, I mixed soy sauce, garlic power and ground ginger and marinated the chicken overnight (30 minutes would do).   I then cooked the chicken with the ginger and garlic. I also added veggies in 1-min intervals -- mixing in-between servings to saturate the veggies with flavor and to ensure that is it perfectly cooked.  After adding a generous amount of soy sauce and before mixing in the sesame oil and toasted sesame seeds, I also dissolved 1 cup of chicken broth with 2 tbsp of cornstarch and let it simmer for 2 minutes to thicken the sauce.  My husband's reaction after his first bite? "WOW!!!!" I savored this rare moment.  He usually waits for me to ask, then gives a generic answer ("Everything you cook is delicious!").  This recipe is awesome!

This was great. I added sliced carrots, a canned mixture of bamboo shoots/water chestnuts/baby corn, and 2 boneless skinless chicken breasts to the veggie mixture. I also reduced the ginger by a teaspoon (didn't want it too sweet). I will definitely make this again. Thanks for the great recipe, Verona!!

Yum! I used canola oil instead of the peanut oil and it was still delicious.

The flavor was good, but it was so oily that neither I nor my room mate could eat much. My sister loved it, though.

Delicious.  I used a bit less oil as others suggested and toasted the sesame seeds in the wok and removed them before starting the stir fry..  I think the key is to make sure that the oil is really hot so within a minute of adding the veggies your wok is steaming.  Just be careful when you add the garlic because if you add it to the oil first it will explode -- spitting out at you.

I made this with a few changes and loved it. I used vegetable oil and sesame oil instead of peanut oil. I didn't have any. I used cabbage, mushrooms, onion, green and yellow pepper, carrots and zucchini. I added crushed red pepper and it was delicious.

Tried this method with a couple alterations. I used jasmine rice, cooked with just water, and 1 t of butter. Used (untoasted) sesame oil rather than peanut oil because I am out of peanut (I imagine peanut is more authentic, but the sesame worked fine-it also is capable of withstanding high temps). Try toasting the sesame seeds in a small iron skillet over med heat until fragrant and just barely beginning to turn amber, then remove from the heat before they get any ideas about burning. Threw some lemongrass in with the ginger (I buy these convenient tubes of minced lemongrass, ginger, basil, etc. at the store. They keep pretty well and save a good deal of time-also I live in a town which apparently thinks fresh lemongrass is something you spray with Round-Up) and about two tablespoons of Thai green chili paste in the wok just before everything else. You might try 1/2 soy and 1/2 fish sauce (nam pla) and you might want to try pouring in half a can of coconut milk, unsweetened, and let it all simmer a minute or two, then add some chopped cilantro...Thai style... but I didn't want to stray too far from the recipe's character. Just wanted some different flavors to go with the fish I was making. I squeezed a lime over everything when I added the dark sesame oil (of which I used only about 1 1/2 teaspoons-it's kind of expensive and a little goes a long way). This recipe is probably fine the way it is written, but I thought my tweaks might inspire somebody else to be creative, too.

This will be a regular meal addition in our house. I used chicken stock, snap peas, and brown rice. Delicious flavor combination that is very simple to create, thank you for the great base.

Great sauce!  I added chicken breast chunks, fresh green beans, and fresh cherry tomatoes and cooked a few more minutes than called for as I prefer my stir fry veggies cooked fairly thoroughly.  I used brown 'minute' rice. My boyfriend said this was probably the best stir fry he's ever had.  This is a keeper and next time I will try broccoli as well.

Yes! I love this recipe! There are so many flavors that melt in my mouth all together...mmmm so good!
I don' know if Hubby or kiddies will like it but that doesn't matter - I could eat the whole thing by myself and they can have peanut butter sandwhiches!

This recipe was superb! The only thing I did differently was I used brown long grain rice instead of white. To make this a complete meal and for protein, I also added sauteed chicken breast cut up into bite sized pieces. Easy and quick preparation and the flavor was outstanding! This recipe will definitely be added to our dinner rotation!

I improvised a touch on the original recipe. No peppers on hand, so just used Red onion, mushroom, broccoli, carrots, asparagus, fresh ginger, garlic cloves,toasted sesame seeds, no regular sesame oil or peanut oil, so used chili sesame oil instead, and soy sauce. I also had no vegetable broth, so used chicken broth in the rice and butter not margarine.  We contribute to a veggie and fruit co-op called Bountiful Baskets and for a very small price we get a ton of stuff weekly or bi-weekly! We had Asparagus in our last contribution.

This was delicious!  I used whatever veggies were on sale (cabbage, bean sprouts, carrots, etc.) and added rice noodles directly to the stir fry rather than serving it over rice.  The sesame oil makes all the difference.

I'm not a picky eater and I love vegetables but this was seriously disappointing. I'm not sure if I just haven't mastered stir frying or something but it was oily and flavorless.

I loved this. Very tastey. I think I'll go a little lighter on the oil next time, not sure it needed as much as the recipe called for. Followed exactly.

I was quite pleased with this recipe....I used snow peas, green peppers, carrots, and mushrooms, and that was a really good mix.  I really liked the peanut and sesame oil flavors together.  I will definitely make this again.

Wonderful and so easy to make.  I used a little more sesame oil and I toasted my sesame  seeds on the stove top in a frying pan fir a couple of minutes. No oil needed.

This was very good and will make it again. I made a couple of substitutes only because I didn't have peanut or sesame oil. Would use other veggies next time just for a bit of variety. Overall, a great recipe

Delicious!  I used broccoli, snow peas and red pepper.  Just added soy sauce to taste and drizzled a teensy bit of sesame oil at the end (I think sesame oil can be overpowering.)  i didn't serve it over rice b/c we were having pork fried rice.  But could easily add shrimp or chicken and serve over rice for a complete meal.  Very good!  Husband loved it!!

I thought this was fantastic. Tasted just like you would get in a restaurant. I added a bit of teriyaki sauce I had on hand to the soy sauce, but other than that I kept everything the same. Well, that's not true. I spent $6 on a jar of toasted sesame seeds just for this and in the thrill of having it made I forgot to sprinkle some on the top. Will definitely do it next time though. It can only improve the flavor I would imagine. The really great thing about this dish is you can use any spare vegetables on hand and I'm sure it'll taste great. Next time I'll add some broccoli and carrots as others have mentioned. It seems like it's a very versatile recipe.

I wasn't expecting much because this recipe seemed kind of boring, but wow, was it good!  Based on other reviews, I used about half as much sesame oil at the end after it was finished cooking, but otherwise I followed the recipe pretty closely.  I will definitely make this recipe again!

Delicious! I used green peppers, broccoli, carrots, onion, canned mushrooms, and celery, just because that is what I had on hand. I also substituted ground ginger since I didn't have any fresh, and used corn oil since I had no peanut oil. I love the double sesame finish! I used toasted sesame seeds so that eliminated the need to bake them myself. Served over rice alongside 'Baked Teriyaki Chicken', also from this site and with an Asian salad with 'Japanese Ginger Salad Dressing', also from this site. What a fantastic meal! Thanks for sharing!

I love that this recipe includes asparagus - something I rarely think to purchase at the store, but love to eat.  I added a vegetable flavorboost packet along with the soy sauce and honestly forgot about the ginger until we had already eaten.  Next time I'll remember the ginger, and add black pepper/red pepper flakes for some heat.

I did not have asparagus so used frozen green beans and we liked it pretty well. also substituted slivered almond since I could not find my sesame seeds. ( may have used up) and rice bran oil since i di not have the sesame oil. Hopefully make again when I actually have these 3 items. Worked well other way also.

I love this recipe. I would make a little more rice.  I didn't think the ratio of rice to mixture was even.  I will fix this over and over again.  And more importantly to me, it was EASY EASY EASY and FAST!

My girlfriend gave this dish a "7*" AND I had forgotten to buy the sesame seeds to boot! Only other thing I changed was to use teriyaki sauce instead of soya. Never had asperagus in a stir-fry - normally not crazy about asperagus, but in this dish, it was very tasty. Can use this recipe with other veggies as well as marinated beef, pork, chicken.

I lightly toasted the seasame seeds before adding them to the stirfry by toasting them in a same skillet on low heat until golden brown.  It releases their fragrant flavor.  Added snow pea pods, brocoli and tofu to make a complete meal out of this.  Even my tofu-hating girlfriends loved this.

With the large crew of people to feed that compose our family (there are 8 of us) I have to nearly double or triple all recipes. 

That said this was absolutely delicious, with several minor alternations, which was little more then adding Snow Peas, Scallions, and Zucchini to add more variety in the vegetables.

The other thing that might  be suggested is to use a bit of Arrowroot/Cornstarch to thicken the sauce a bit if that is your preference.

Made this for my girlfriend and I and we both enjoyed it so much! Took the teriyaki idea from Amy's comment below, but also subbed out the asparagus for broccoli, carrots, snap peas and added an orange bell pepper as well. I forgot the mushrooms, though. Had some left over from the other night, just forgot to pull them out. =(

For soooo few ingredients this "sauce" was thee best!  Used all sorts of veggies that needed to be used up and a bag of broccoli slaw...Delicious.  DH on south beach diet so no rice but did serve it up with some really thin sliced filet mignon.  Sort of like beef/broccoli from our favorite Chinese restaurant.  Thanks for the inspiration for yet another great meal. 7/11/13

Excellent recipe, and easy to make, too. I added more garlic than called for and made a double batch. I also added the onions first and let them cook down a bit before adding the peppers, asparagus, garlic, and ginger. I added the mushrooms toward the end of cooking, and the soy sauce soon after. The resultant dish has a wonderful flavor.

Very simple and delicious. I had snow peas instead of asparagus, and I added some heritage carrots we had around the house. I also probably doubled the garlic and ginger, but we love those flavors. Using broth for the rice makes it very moist, and this recipe calls for a smaller amount of rice than I would usually make for a family-sized recipe, but I think it encouraged everyone to eat more veggies, so that was a good outcome too. Overall, this is a good basic guide to a healthy stir fry that focuses on the veggies instead of on a thick sauce.

I loved this dish.  My husband is a very picky eater and he had no complaints.  To make it a bit more healthy than it already is I used brown rice and substituted coconut oil for the peanut oil.  I didn't add the soy sauce because it's salty and overrides the taste of the veggies.

This was just okay... Nothing overly Asian or flavourful about it. I made the rice as I usually do in a rice cooker which is just water and rice. I used a bag of frozen, sliced stir-fry oriental vegetables and two peppers (one each of red and green). I used jarred, minced ginger and peanut oil instead of sesame. The sesame seeds are a nice touch for visual appeal but don't add much to the dish. I found it to be somewhat bland and oily. Hubby-to-be liked it; served it with chicken teriyaki.

Very good with nutty flavor.  It could be modified by using only 1.5 T peanut oil and be OK.  It definitely warrants fresh vegetables.  Did not modify recipe at all.

I'm always changing things up and using what I have on hand. Ground ginger instead of fresh, used chicken, brown rice instead of white, etc. It still came out deeeelish! I'll make again for sure. Probably with shrimp, mmm.

I add chicken to the recipe for a complete meal.  My family and I love the flavor and add our own touches of additional ginger root, broccoli, water chesnuts, bamboo shoots, and serve it over rice spaghetti.  Great way to have the kids eat their veggie with no complaining.

EXCELLENT! I used coconut oil instead for a little extra health benefit. I also used crushed (jarred) ginger, as I didn't have the root available. It turned out very tasty. This will become a staple in our house! My little ones loved it too! You must try this easy dish.

I made some changes on ingredients, since I wanted to use up vegetables I had in my fridge. I used a bunch of broccoli instead of asparagus and a few small green peppers instead of a large red pepper, then added half of a red onion. I omitted peanut oil and mushrooms because I didn't have in hands. I served vegetables over rice and it tasted great.

Very good.  I used the broth as a sause to coat the veggies and thickened it with arrowroot.  It was a little too heavy on the ginger, but I can fix that next time.  I also added breaded garlic tofu that added a nice variety to the stir fry.  Yum!

I try to plan at least 1 vegetable meal a week.  This was a winner!  As a Realtor, I’m under pressure to prepare healthy meals while accommodating a tough schedule, this was delicious and can be prepared in a timely manner.  The husband loved it!

This recipe is good, but I felt that it needed some spice or sauce to go with it. I added Jalapeño and  fresh lime at the end. Will make again for our meatless Tuesdays, and add more veggies.

I made this tonight for dinner and it was the best meal we have had in a long time!  There was nothing left!!  I made it exactly as the recipe calls for with the exception of using grapeseed oil rather then peanut oil.

My family and "people" love it!! I am a care giver for an elderly couple. Mr. has a very difficult time with swallowing the rice, so I substituted with Quinoa. I also added a cut up chicken breast to add some lean protein.

Very simple recipe to prep, and even less effort to cook up quickly! Made this up for my lady and I on a busy and late evening and it was fantastic. Very easy to just use vegetables you have on hand (I used red bell pepper, red onion, carrots, and parsnips). Better yet, it has a fantastic flavor, with no need to add seasonings! Oh, and the rice made with vegetable broth was a nice new take for me.
Overall, fast, easy, and tasty. Good combo for a meal.

Good easy quick recipe that you can add things or just use whatever you have handy. I used rice noodles and threw some Celery and small piece of broccoli cut up for my greens since no asparagus. And used peanuts satay wand grape seed oil to make the peanut oil. Yummy

Easy, but a touch greasy in the end. I would probably use slightly less peanut oil and double-check to ensure I'm using low-sodium veggie broth. Still, I like that the recipe gives a solid base for a stir fry. I tossed in a few vegetables not in the recipe based on perishables I wanted out of my fridge. Would make again.

I made this recipe for my daughter who loves vegetables. She said "mom, this is awesome!" The only thing I added was a bit of Teriyiki as mentioned in one of the comments. I also added zucchini.The flavor was excellent. By the way, the rice is delicious too. I will be making this recipe again.

I made this as written, but I added chicken to complete the meal.  I used a
mix of colored peppers and a red onion that I needed to use up.  This
was good, but next time I think I’d add a touch of sweetness and a little
heat.

This was delicious! I think I added a little more soy sauce than the recipe called for but it still turned out wonderful, and the peanut oil with the sesame oil made it taste just right! My favorite is that I served it over coconut rice which turned out to be a wonderful combination! I could also see chicken easily added to this recipe. I will definitely be making this again!

Made this last night.  Family loved it.  I added chicken and kicked it up a notch w/ red pepper flakes and chili garlic sauce.  I also had sliced carrots. I'll make this one again.

Delicious & satisfying! I made it exactly as instructed & did not change any of the ingredients. This will be part of my dinner rotation from now on.

Very good, used coconut oil instead of peanut and it worked well. Could add other things like snap peas or chicken to this dish.

I used a tablespoon of peanut butter in place of the peanut oil and broccoli instead of asparagus, just because it was what I had. I loved the flavors! The minced ginger can be very strong so mince as tiny as possible to avoid a larger piece in one bite. Also, the addition of sliced carrots and snow peas is a nice touch to try.

I used frozen Stir Fried Vegetable with Asparagus. I used half of the amount of vegetables called for in this recipe and sauteed the onions ,mushrooms and red pepper and then added the Stir Fried Vegetables. My husband who does not like vegetables really enjoyed this!

I followed the receipe exactly and it was just ok sorry to say. After all that chopping! It was lacking in flavor that final wow factor. My family thought it was good but I think they were just being nice. I don't think I will use this receipe again.

Pretty tasty!  Hubby and I had to add Tapatio and additional soy sauce, so next time, I'll probably throw in red pepper flakes.  Will also add cashews so there's a bit more protein.

After reading the reviews I thought this was going to knock my socks off....not so much.  I made this for dinner tonight and used bok choy instead of asparagus and added water chestnuts.  I am thankful I added the water chestnuts...they made the dish better for me.  I don't feel the change from asparagus to bok choy would affect flavour TOO much and I kept everything else the same, thus the 3 star rating.  Just an ok dish.

A terrific blend of vegetables and spices!  Next time, I might add a bit more ginger - but I love ginger!
