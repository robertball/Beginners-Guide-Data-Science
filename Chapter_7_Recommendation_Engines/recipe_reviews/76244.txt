Very good mousse! I thought it definitely tastes light - it has a little bit of an aftertaste, but the strawberries help cover it up. All in all, a good recipe.

I make this dessert for my mom who is diabetic and she loves it.  It does not raise her blood sugar, so it's a treat with no big penalty.  I am not diabetic, but love this mousse.

Very good!  It almost had a chocolate pudding taste to it instead of true mousse.  My husband and I made this mousse and another recipe that just called for chocolate and eggs (original mousse) and I think we liked this one a little more.  Very good with fresh strawberries.
