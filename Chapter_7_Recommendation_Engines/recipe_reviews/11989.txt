I had to prepare a luncheon for 150 and used this recipe as one main dish. I doubled the recipe and used 5 crock pots.I grated and shredded the cheeses the day before and measured out zip lock bags for  each crock pot. That morning it only took a few minutes to assemble the ingredients and cook the spaghetti. I had more compliments on this dish than on anything else I've ever served. I've another event for this group in April and I've benn asked to "please, please, please include that spaghetti thing in the crock pot."

This was great comfort food.  I took the advice of others and didn't add so much cheese even though cheese is my favorite food.  I also added a can of cream of mushroom soup and 3/4 of the actual needed sour cream.  I only cooked it on high for 1 1/2 hours cause it did start to burn, but it gives it a nice little crunch.  I will make this again and probably cook it on low and stir it occasionally to keep it from burning on the sides.  I will also add more spinach cause I really like spinach.  Thanks for the recipe- I LOVED it!!

I followed advice from below, adding 4 cloves of garlic and baking it in the oven at 400 for 40 minutes.  I also used egg noodles, fresh chopped baby spinach, and added chopped mushroons.  It came out great!

I made this dish in the OVEN instead of the crockpot and it worked out well, although I did make a couple changes. I left out the fried onions, increased the garlic to 4 cloves finely chopped, and added hot italian sausage. After combining everything, I baked it in a grased casserole dish for 40 min at 400 degrees (topping w/ extra cheese for the last 10 minutes). It's a keeper recipe done this way and I'd recommend trying it in the oven if the crockpot didn't work out.

Very yummy! Adjusted this to: 2 eggs, 1/2 sour cream, 1 can cream of mushroom soup, chopped onions instead of fried and used six cheese Italian blend instead of the cheeses listed. Oh, and used bowtie pasta instead. I also added some salt, pepper, basil and oregano. I think next time I'll add some fresh tomatoes. I bet that would be awesome.  I followed another reviewer and baked it for 40 minutes at 400 instead of slow cooker.

This definitely has a good flavor.  My husband and I loved it - the kids say no though.  I was so glad to read the comments before I made it though cuz it helped in preparing it better.  Used 3 cans of diced tomatoes for liquid and a whole container of sour cream.  Less cheese too.

This is a great basic recipe but it really lacked a kick, and that was after I added a bunch of spices(italian herbs, cracked pepper, etc).  So I added some fancy-super-hot-hot sauce at the end and it turned out fantastic. I also sauteed some yellow onion instead of the french fried onions. Made this for father's day 09.  I will make this again.  edit: august 14, 2009- made again.  awesome:    used more garlic, slightly more cheese, and a whole box of fettuccine noodles broken in thirds.  also added more spinach and italian herbs. added additional 1 cup of sourcream when there was an hour left. yummy yummy yummy!!!  with these additions, 5 stars!

We've made this several times. Have to watch it with my slow cooker as setting it too high lets it burn too easily. Also good with strips or small chunks of chicken tossed in.

I tried this yesterday, and followed the advice of other reviewers.  I used 4 cloves of garlic, reduced the cheese just a bit, and added a can of diced tomatoes.  My family LOVED this! No leftovers!!   I will be making this again and again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the directions but I didn't have a 10 oz pkg of spinach so I estimated-maybe added a bit more.  The kids hated it.  I thought it wasn't too bad.  It was excellent left over and reheated.  Maybe will try with a little less spinach next time.

I really used this more as a basis of a recipe.  I doubled the amount of spaghetti, used only 2 cups of cheese and used sauteed onions instead of the ones from a can.  However, I also added a drained can of diced tomatoes and 1/2 pound of crumbled bacon.  I didn't have time to make in a slow cooker so I baked at 400 for 40 minutes per PP.  This was so good!

With a little sprucing (extra garlic, a little less spinach, more pasta), this was amazing. Made five or six main-dish sized servings.

Awesome!  Added a can of cream of mushroom soup and only cooked in crockpot for 2 hours on low (stirring occasionally).  Cut back the cheese to 2 cups.  It's delicious!

I added 2lbs of browned cubed chicken breast to round it out as a meal and cut out the fried onions. Overall, it made my crockpot messy but I thought it was good,my hubby and son thought it had to much spinach.More than likely I wont be making this one again.

This recipe is awesome.  I have made it several times, and shared it with anyone who loves spinach.  I use fresh baby spinach in place of the frozen spinach.  I find working with fresh is much easier then the frozen.  I also use about 1C less of the Monterey cheese.  I have made this with different types of cheese: pepper jack, mozzarella, mexican cheese blend, etc. and they all work if propotioned right.  I cook in the oven at 350 for about 20 min covered, then uncovered topped with reserved 1/2C cheese and French Fried onions for about 10-15 min. I cannot thank you enough for a terrific recipe.  Thanks Corwynn.

I agree with the other reviews it needs more sour cream.Next time i will add diced tomatoes to it. It was a little bland and the spaghetti burned on the bottom so before it was supposed to be done.

This was a fabulous idea.  The only thing I did differently was add a can of diced tomatoes with the juice.  Monterey is a greasy cheese by nature, so cutting back or using different cheeses is a great solution.  And stirring once in a while is a must.  The kids tore it up!

This dish was very disappointing.  After cooking only 4 hour on low, the dish is complete mush and tastes very bland. Now I have to go salvage dinner...

We tried this over the weekend, but I used 1lb of spaghetti (whole wheat) and baked it.  It was a tiny bit dry but we loved the flavor and we would definitely make this again! I think a couple of chicken breasts cubed and lightly browned then added to this would be fantastic and would make it a complete meal.

I didn't make this in a slow cooker but baked it covered for 45 minutes at 350 degrees, with the last 5 minutes uncovered on broil.  Easy and tasty.

Mixed reviews in our home.  Most liked, but thought it could use extra seasonings and possibly chicken

This recipe is tasty, but it is clearly a side dish. It is way too rich to eat any more than a few tablespoons at a meal. Also, I did not grease my crockpot, instead I sprayed it with a cooking spray. No mess! Also I used fresh onion instead. I would make this again.

This was all right. I would not put so much spinach in it. I added tomatoes and spices. The family loved it. I would definitely add more to this dish.

I wanted to like this...and even with the comments about blandness I thought I'd be okay with this recipe because I'm generally sensitive to strong flavors.  Well....It was blah even for me.  I kind of expected it to be creamier, a bit saucier...but it wasn't.  I'm not even sure that tweaking would fix it.  Won't make again.  :-(

Love this! I reduced the cheese too and used yellow onion instead of fried and added chicken. This is a household favorite for us!!

I was excited about this dish, but as it cooked the smell just grossed me out.  I couldn't bring myself to eat it and neither could my husband.  The kids barely touched it.

Very yummy.  I would recommend using a whole 12 oz of pasta and maybe only 8 oz of spinach.  I also added some basil and oregano, used 2 tsps of chopped garlic.  Next time I'm adding some garlic salt as well.  Otherwise this turned out great!

I had several problems with this recipe.  Starting with serving size.  I'm not sure how this could feed 8 people.  I followed this recipe exactly and a little over an hour into cooking it was burning, set on low.  The flavor was okay but the technical recipe needs some work.

Great tasting recipe!  I obviously did something wrong, as my pasta burned/stuck to the sides of my crockpot.  But, the crunch gained from that made the recipe even more deliscous.

This was good, but was just missing "something". Some kind of flavor needed to be added. I will try to make it again and perhaps try some of the other reviewers suggestions. A good base recipe for something different!

We baked it, which even then some of it burnt.  I didn't like the spinach but the rest was ok.  I'd make it again, but would either try it with fresh spinach or none.  Kale might have worked better.

This recipe doesn't make much sense...it seems that the slow cooker is unnecessary. It would work just as well to bake this for 30-40 min instead. I found it to be greasy, and a little dry. It also made a terrible mess of the slow cooker

I made the recipe as stated however I subtracted the fried onions (because i didnt even know u could buy fried onion in a can) and I added real onions, extra garlin as well as cracked pepper and a touch of nutmeg. I also used low fat sour cream and mild cheddar as I was told this is similar to Monteray Jack which you can not buy in the land of oz... Oh and I used fresh baby spinach as frozen spinach lacks flavour.

This meal was very good.  I added a a can of cream of chicken soup to make it more moist.  My picky husband loved it and I had enough to give to our friends.  I will definitely makes this again.  Thanks!

We made this last night and I'm sad to say that we didn't like it at all.  I thought it was totally lacking flavor, which was surprising considering all of the seemingly great ingredients.  I think adding a powerful cheese (Blue cheese, Gruyere, sharp cheddar) would give it the "punch" it needs.

I really liked this recipe. I made it as a meal by adding 1 large can of white chunk chicken (drained), and half a medium bag of frozen broccoli florets (cooked). I then baked at 400 for 35 mins. Lastly,I added a top layer of Monterey Jack cheese and fried french onions, cooked for an additional 5 mins.

I almost rated this 1 star. Well, it would have been 1-star if I hadn't added so much to make it edible. 

Cooked the recipe just as specified. At the end I did add some already cooked, chopped chicken breast but I don't think that changed the flavor. 

It was very bland and mostly just tasted like mushy pasta and overcooked spinach. I had to add salt, garlic powder, chopped onions, onion powder, and chicken bouillon to try and make it taste ok. At that point after adding all of that it was still mediocre and I needed it to taste good enough for kids to eat. 

Then, as a last ditch effort, I added a tiny bit of italian dressing I had in my fridge. That seemed to make it better. 

If I had it on hand I would've added some pesto but didn't currently have any. 

I also wound up cooking some sausage (ground) and adding it. I figured at this point it won't hurt it but I did feel kind of bad wasting sausage on this. 

It also doesn't need that much time cooking!!! Way, way less.

I used Mini Farfalle instead of spaghetti (only because I didn't have any spaghetti) and I also used fresh spinach (which next time I will chop because I wasn't thinking and just threw it in there whole). I honestly didn't measure the Monterey cheese, because I bought it in a block since I couldn't find it in a bag, but I didn't use but maybe half it called for and it came out great. I also used salt and pepper to taste, a pinch of basil and oregano. When I tasted the sauce right out of the pot, it tasted super salty, but once I cooked the noodles and mixed them in at the end, it no longer tasted salty at all. I thought it was pretty good, and the BF really liked it as well. Definitely a keeper.

Edible, but not enough flavor. This would have benefited from a creamier sauce. I won't make this again.

I made this according to the recipe except substituting a different shape pasta (what I had on hand) and adding more of the French's fried onions, as I felt it was a little bland without them.  It was edible, but definitely just an "okay" all around--not something we'll be making again.  For such a heavy/hearty dish, it just didn't have the taste I was expecting.

This is a good base recipe.  I also added more garlic, a can of diced tomatoes, and seasoning.  I also increased the amount of pasta instead of adjusting the sour cream/cheese amount.  I am not a big fan of cream sauce, so I added some marinara sauce to make it a creamy marinara.  It turned our well, but was overcooked.  Next time, I will reduce to cooking time and also barely cook the pasta before I add it to the crock pot.

I found this recipe (made as listed) and none of us cared for it at all.  It was slightly bland, greasy and I'm trying not to think of the nightmarish mess it made of my slow cooker pot, and that's even with it not being cooked a minute longer than was listed in the recipe and with greasing the pot.  I won't make this again and I think I'd likely be ousted from the house if I did.  I'm sure with some of the changes that people are listing, it might be better, but I won't risk it again and I'm truly surprised it got such a good rating.

This was....okay. Not great, certainly not bad. I added a little cooked, crumbled bacon at the end with the cheese and onions, which helped give it a bit more flavor. I'd probably make it again, because it was easy and the fiancee liked it, but it wasn't as good as it sounded when I read the recipe.

I made this recipe following other's suggestions...adding more garlic, baking it in the oven. I also used cheddar instead of monterey, since that was what I had in the house. My family liked this meal.

The flavor was good - however, it got burnt a little on the sides cooking it according to the recipe. I think next time I will add more liquid and stir it more often to prevent it from burning. But, overall, the flavor was good.

For the amount of fat (28g per serving) in this recipie I thought it would be very creamy.  However it was very bland.  I don't think it was worth it at all.

I read the reviews as I was putting everything in the slow cooker and tried to take caution with the cook time, but after only about 2 hours the cheese was carmelizing the dish was looking less than appealing. I agree with those who called this recipe bland, it is certainly lacking and I wouldn't recommend it. Opt for a baked spinach lasagna instead. It takes less cook time and tastes much better.

Unfortunately, I didn't read the reviews that mentioned it overcooking until I was at work and it was at home overcooking.  Too bad, the part that was unburned seemed okay.

I guess you could substitute fat-free sour cream and low fat cheeses; the description says "healty and wholesome", but this recipe is 70% fat!!!!  That is NOT healthy in my opinion.  Too bland, not worth it

This dish seriously lacked flavor. It also started to burn after only a couple hours in slow cooker on low. I had to remove it and then reheat it in the microwave. This is one dish I won't be making again.

i loved the taste of this recipe when it was done. i thought the cooktime was too much and mine ended up burning on the edges. i dont think this recipe is too "healthy" either as it states above, but i definitely loved the taste of it. i think it could use more spaghetti next time because i dont see how this recipe could serve 8.

I served this for a potluck and I didn't have any leftovers at all (I was disappointed!)  I added bacon bits to this and added a little extra freshly minced garlic.  It was just wonderful and easy to make!

This was good but the only thing was the cheese burnt that was at the bottom of the slowcooker. It didn't stick, just turned really dark brown. It still tasted great! Next time I'll make sure most of the cheese is closer to the top and maybe give it a little less cooking time.

Well, I was a little afraid to try this after some of the reviews.  I only cooked this for about 2 hours in the crockpot, stirring often.  Also, I kept my noodles seperate from the crockpot--that way they wouldn't absorb the flavor or get mushy.  It turned out very nicely.

I was a little disappointed with this recipe..I love spinach but would definately cut the spinach by half and maybe omit the fried onions all together.  I did add tomatoes and in if I make it in the future maybe a few artichokes.  It was 100% better after it was refrigerated and reheated.  I might make it again just to try a few variations but I would make it as more of a side dish rather than the main course or try it again as a meal except I would try adding chicken.

Exactly what I expected after reading many of the reviews.  Taste was ok--needed "something".  SOmewhat bland but still very much edible.  I too somehow ended up with a lot of stickiness even after adding cream of chicken soup to smooth it out.  I added some chicken broth and served with diced tomoatos to liquify things.  WIll make this again out of convenience but sure wouldn't make to entertain friends.

I made some adjustments to the recipe based on other reviews.  I added the cream of mushroom, some heavy cream and 2% milk along with extra garlic and crushed red pepper.  I used half the amount of sour cream and Monterey cheese.  I also used bow tie pasta instead of spaghetti and fresh spinach instead of frozen.   I probably could have put more spinach but long story short...my family loved this!

After reading the reviews, I added one can of  cream of mushroom soup, 2 cans of chopped tomatoes, including liquid from one of the cans.  Did not used fried onions.  I made it ahead, refrigerated, then heated 350 for 25 minutes.  The crowd ate it all up!  It was just the right level of liquid, not dry at all.

I only sprinkled with parm (no cellulose) cheese and used 6 oz. of feta crumbles instead.  I also used 3 tablespoons of minced garlic as I like a little more kick.  This was a very tasty recipe and will make it again.

I was looking for a meal that I could throw in the crock pot and leave on low for 8 hours while we were at work and school (this recipe suggested 6-8 hours, so I thought I'd be okay).  It was tasty, although chewy since the sides burned, but dry, very greasy, and not the amazing dish that I'd hoped for.  Other reviewers who baked this in the oven, used fresh onions, etc., have the right idea.  This is just not a throw-it-in-the-pot-and-you're-good-for-dinner-when-you-get-home-from-a-hard-day kind of meal.

Unfortunately I made this dish exactly the way the instructions are laid out here, which was a mistake.  The edges were overbrowned and the dish was bland and very dry.  Next time I would add cream of mushroom soup and leave the crockpot on Low for maybe 4-6 hours instead of 8.  Very disappointed as I've eaten this dish made by other people, but I'm not sure what recipe they used.

I used the recipe as a base with just a few changes to suit my cooking style and tastes and followed some other reviewers suggestions.  I reduced the cheese, used a lot of sautéed elephant ear garlic, added mushrooms, cooked sliced breaded chicken breasts, and fried up some Panchetta to throw in.  I think next time I'll leave out the spinach and try it with broccoli.  I added the sour cream at the end so the flavor wouldn't cook out and I added fresh cherry tomatoes as garnishment to the plate.  It was very good.  Teens and adults enjoyed it a lot.  Thanks!

We really liked this dish!  When cooking it in the slow cooker, it was done in about an hour then started to burn on the sides.  So, going forward I think I will make it in the oven.  I also made it the following way and it came out great!
10 oz Pasta
4 Garlic Cloves
16 oz Sour Cream
10 oz Frozen Spinach
1 Can Diced Tomatoes
6 oz Fried Onions
1 Can Cream of Mushroom Soup
2 Eggs
1/2 Cup Parmesan Cheese
2 Cups Monterey Jack Cheese
Will definitely make again!

Good side dish. I made on Thanksgiving and most everyone commented that they liked it. I halved the amount of cheese and substituted non-dairy sour cream and it still tasted fine.

Stuck to the sides and didn't cook for near as long as recipe states, but still stated good.

Good, but needs finessing to appeal to my family's taste. Good starter for a mild, easy pasta dish.

After reading some of the other reviews, I was worried about trying this in the slow cooker so I did it in the oven.  I used Colby Jack cheese since Wal-Mart apparently doesn't carry shredded Monterey Jack cheese. Added a tad bit more garlic.  Was rather tasty and quick to put together. Needs a bit more liquid or less cooking time because the spaghetti was a little crunchy in some parts of the dish from over cooking.  I did about 30 minutes covered until the last five minutes when I added last bit of cheese and onions to the top.

I found this recipie to be very greasy, probably from the cheese.  We won't be trying it again.

This was really a hit in our house!  It got a little dry by the time we ate it, but was really delicious nonetheless.

I thought this would be a great dish since it listed such yummy ingredients.  I needed "something" so I added cream of mushroom soup.  That still didn't help.  I may make this again to try & "tweak" it & see if I can make this one work.  It certainly is not good if you follow the recipe and it does burn.

This has become a favorite dish in my house.  We love it!!!  I will admit, I put about 3/4th of the spinach in but that is the only change.  Yummy!!!

It dried out a little.  I think it should cook for less time than recipe states.
