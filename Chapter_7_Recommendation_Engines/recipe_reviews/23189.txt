This recipe was exactly what I was looking for.  My brother and I used to fight over the angel food candy every Christmas. It was a favorite of both of ours. After I made this, I couldn't wait for him to try some.  Well, as I thought, he couldn't keep his hands off of it.  When I told him that I made it, he wouldn't believe me.  I actually had to show him the recipe in order to convince him that it wasn't store bought. Here are a few things that you might like to know about this recipe. First of all be sure to use all of the baking powder, stir it in quickly and then pour it into the buttered pan. Make sure you just pour it into your pan, do not spread it around. This recipe is great, but if you want the candy even lighter, be sure to butter the pan all the way up the sides and then put the candy into the oven at 200 to 250 degrees right after you pour it into the pan for ten minutes and then decrease the temperature to 170 degrees for another ten minutes. The candy will puff up and fill the entire pan. It is a good idea to use a metal pan or one of those flexible pans. This makes it easier to get the candy out when it cools. Thanks Debbie, for sharing this recipe with us.

Perfect!  It is also called fairy food, seafoam, sponge candy, honeycomb, hot air candy, etc.  After 8-10 failed batches, I finally found the way to success:  If you don’t have a high quality DIGITAL candy thermometer, don’t even try this.  The brand I use is CDN.  Previously I had tried a cheap analog thermometer and/or testing in cold water, but the candy cooks so quickly that by the time the thermometer registered the right temp (or a sample formed a brittle thread), the candy had already cooked to a much higher temp.  It burned EVERY time I tried these methods.    Before starting to cook the candy, prepare:  Line your pan with non-stick foil.  Measure and sift baking soda.  Make sure your pan is large enough, as the mixture will foam a great deal after you add the baking soda.  Use a heat-proof silicone spatula for stirring the candy mixture.  Cook only at medium heat or lower; higher will cause the candy to cook too fast and it will burn.   Be ready; the SECOND the candy thermometer registers 295° (300° risks burning), slide your pan off the burner and add the baking soda.  Stir quickly, but be sure to incorporate every bit of the soda.  (It’s nasty to get even a teeny bite of pure soda!)  Pour into the nonstick foil-lined pan as evenly as you can, but resist the urge to spread it.  It will fill in the empty spots as it cools and settles.  Score cooled candy w/ a serrated knife, then place into a Ziploc bag and break.  Pieces will be irregular in shape.

Yes - finally SUCCESS!!  I've  been making this candy using this recipe  for 4 or 5 yr now. Best candy ever but frustrating to make.  We make for Christmas, but it takes 4 - 5 tries to get 2 - 3 good batches.  Well, this year I went back and read all the reviews and made some changes and ended up with 2 perfect batches for 2 tries!!  Per Lisa K, we sifted the baking soda, used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar (in place of 1 cup white), used parchment paper to line the pan, put in 225 degree oven for 10 min after we poured into pan, then lowered to 170 for 10 min more (amazed it continues used to puff up), and lastly scored with a knife and then broke by hand into (mostly) perfect pieces (did try the pizza cutter but got very crumbly results.  Thought I would put all these tips in one place.  I'm so excited I don't have to go through numerous ruined batches to get the couple of good ones I need for the holidays.  This truly is a family favorite and want to thank everyone for the great tips!

This is great! I have tried a lot of different reipes, and this one is a good one. For the person who said it smells like campfire marshmallows burning; you are probably cooking it on too high heat. I used to burn mine all the time, because I was in a hurry to get it up to the required temperature on the candy thermometer. I have learned to cook it slower, and it turns out every time. I also use light corn syrup, and it tastes good.

Wonderful recipe, brought me back to my favorite childhood treat.  BUT much better with real dipping chocolate than the coating.

Very quick and easy to make. Tastes just like the old fashioned Angel Food Candy my husband grew up eating at Christmas time, he said.  I used real chocolate (3 cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips) and 1/4 cup of vegetable shortening to make my own chocolate coating (heated it in microwave).  Then set the candy in the refrigerator to set up faster.

This is a really easy recipe.  For one who had never made candy or used a candy thermometer until this recipe, I found it very easy.  I would also like to stress not to spread the candy once you have placed it in the pan.  Makes more than it seems like it is going to.

The only issue I had with this recipe wasn't really with the recipe.  You should note, REMOVE IMMEDIATELY from heat when the desired temp is reached...otherwise, it tastes a little burned.

OK, you're all probably going to hate me. I had NO trouble making this recipe at all. And I've never made it before. So, you CAN do it. Don't be afraid to try! But, I did read the reviews thoroughly. I used half brown sugar and half white sugar, and sifted my baking soda. I greased my GLASS (Bc it's what I have) baking pan well, over every crevice, and had everything all ready to go and in it's place when I started cooking the candy. You want to cook it LOW & SLOW. I'm talking med low heat, it will take a LONG time. Find something else to do while it's cooking., and leave it alone! I used only a cheap candy thermometer because it's what I had, and I found that my candy was ready before it reached 350 degrees. I used the cold water test. That's a better indicator of when it's ready then strictly going by the temp (again,in my opinion. I mean, what did our moms and grandmother's do without candy thermometers?). Also, I too used melted semi-sweet chocolate with just a touch of shortening in it in place of the choc conf coating.

I don't know how it was supposed to turn out, exactly, but it wasn't what I had envisioned.  It was too big for my dish and ended up touching the sides, which made it extremely hard to remove from it.  I didn't even bother adding the chocolate coating.  Perhaps some of these things are my fault (I've never been an excellent candymaker) but I didn't like the recipe anyhow.

I am having so much difficulty making this recipe.  It plops out of the pot all nice and foamy and thick, but then once it is in the buttered pan, it flattens down to about half an in within about a minute or two.  I don't know what I'm doing wrong.  I've tried half a dozen times, all withthe same results

I remember eating this candy during the holidays when I was a child (30+ years ago!).  I haven't seen it to buy for a long time, so had to try out the recipe.  It was just as I remembered.  It was easy to make, although mine easily filled the pan.  I also prefer using semi-sweet chocolate to coat instead of the other coating.

I can't believe how good these are. I made these for my Christmas cookie platter and they were the first to go. Everyone raved about them. I don't have a candy thermometer and the first time I made these, I didn't cook the sugar mixture long enough and they didn't turn out. The second time I cooked it for almost half an hour and kept testing drops in water. It was perfect. I will be making this every Holiday!

Need help, mine came out to hard the first time so I went down to about 275F, then it was too soft. I also found that I had huge bubbles; should I stir more? Taste great! What am I doing wrong?

Try these alterations if you like it more dense and not so airy. -ONLY use 1/2 TBSP baking soda (thats 1 1/2 tsp) -Use a large 13x18" sheet pan -lined pan with foil and butter as instructed  -Pour into sheet pan. It will not fill the pan but creates more room for it to spread. And it will be more dense. Not falling apart when you try to eat it.

I tried this for Christmas Eve since I had never heard of it before and looked yummy. I didn't read the reviews before so it didn't turn out as well as it could have. The candy was hard and I thought it was going to break a few teeth in the process. I do want to try this again but with recommended changes and see how it goes.

Delicious! In my part of the states, we call this stuff sea foam. It costs a TON to buy it in the stores, so I was glad to find out this stuff is cheap and easy to make! I like to use real chocolate, though. Dark chocolate compliments the sweetness of this candy perfectly

Totally worth the time!!!  I grew up with my parents buying this candy around xmas time and HAD to make it.  The first and third time I made it... it didn't turn out.  It was flat and hard.  The second time was SO GOOD.  I followed the advice of Lisa K that time and used light corn syrup w/half brown sugar.  1st and 3rd with dark... don't know if I did something wrong.  Dipped in semi-sweet chocolate and milk chocolate.  I'll be making this every year for sure!!!

I made this and it turned out awesome. The family said it's as good if not better then the stuff you buy in the store. There is a little trick to making this come out of the pan without any problem... I lined the bottom of my pan with Parchment paper. It also makes clean up a breeze.

I made this today, as a fourth attempt, and third recipe.  It actually turned out decently!  I combined a few tips:
I made sure to cook the sugar to above 300 degrees, removed it from the heat immediately and used sifted b.powder.  I also followed Lisa K's suggestion to put the mixture in the oven to set.  I used a silicone cake pan as well.  My pizza cutter came in handy to score the candy, and it broke right along the lines.  I stored it in a freezer bag (keep moisture out) until I can coat it on Sunday.  I would like to figure out though, how to get the bubbles to be all teeny-tiny and not so much like Swiss cheese!

I made this because my mom used to make it. There are 8 kids and we used to fight over it. I doubled the recipe. When it reached hard boil I thought - perfect! I put it in 2 glass pans... beautiful. Then it came time to break it in pieces - what was I thinking? This is a mess. Oh well, now to dipping it in chocolate - I swore NEVER AGAIN! PAIN in the butt, messy and it took 2 hours to coat all the pieces in their iceberg like sizes and shapes. --- so I dipped it in mostly milk chocolate with a little semi sweet. ---- it hardened in the cold, first taste and WHAM! This is the best candy in the world. DIVINE. ---- I'll make it every year from here on out.

I will never buy angel food candy again.  This was fairly easy, providing the candy thermometer is accurate, and better tasting than the store bought.

I was told about this candy from my husband's family that lives in Wisconsin.  I had never heard of it before.  I really like it and it seems to be a hit with family and friends.  I did not completely cover in chocolate, just dipped a little bit.  I don't know how to get it to break or cut nicely without crumbling though.

I let each of my kids pick something to make today, and this is what my 12 year-old picked (I think she liked the name).  She made most of it herself, I helped a little with the stiring.  It was neat watching the transformation when we added the baking soda, almost like doing a science experiment.  After cooling, we broke it into pieces and sampled.  At first, we thought it was just weird.  But we let it sit, dipped the pieces in chocolate and let them sit overnight.  It's almost gone today.  Defintely dip in chocolate.  It softens it a little and adds the perfect touch.  We really enjoyed this and it will probably become a holiday tradition for my daughter and me.

My great grandmother used to make something very similar over the holidays (I guess) per my dad.  He wanted them but couldn't find a recipe so I made these.  He said these were very close and loved them - as did everyone else.  We all actually liked them w/o chocolate as well.  Either way -  5 stars!

I don't see what he big deal is about this candy.  The candy itself just tasted like sugar.  The only thing that gave it any flavor was the chocolate.  Might as well cover bread with the chocolate and eat that, it would taste the same.  The candy crumbled into dust when I tried to break it.  I put the candy in a zip loc bag to break it up.  It ended up with sharp shards, almost like broken glass, and a bunch of crumbs in the bag.  Looked nothing like the nice squared of candy in the pics.    

I guess the people giving this big ratings are being influenced by childhood memories, based on the comments they make in their reviews because I see nothing special about it.

Not bad!  Never had this candy before so I couldn't pass up trying the recipe after most people commented on growing up with it...where was I?  Had no problems at all.  Mine started to turn a little darker at 275 degrees.  Had I not been right there, it would of burned.  Not bad at all, thanks for the recipe.

So glad I found this recipe.  I call it sponge candy and is very similiar to a cadbury product sold in Europe called Crunchies.  I did not have dark corn syrup but regular corn syrup worked just fine.  A digital thermometer made it easy to know when to remove the heat.   Don't be alarmed by the vinegar smell is will cook off.  Do make sure that when you add the baking soda you quickly but completely mix it into the sugar.  It will foam high so be sure to start with a large enough sauce pan to begin with.  If the baking soda doesnt completely mix it it will become trapped in the little air pockets of the sponge candy.  This is what would leave a strong baking soda taste.  Lastly, like other members have mentioned be sure to COMPLETELY COOL the sponge candy before breaking and coating in chocolate.   Only issue i have is how to break evenly without to much candy flaking away.  All in all a great recipe and will definately make again.

This candy tastes just like the fairy food candy my family buys at the store! It was so easy to make as well...just let it cook on its own until it reaches the right temperature! I made it exactly as written, and it was a huge hit at my house. I don't think I used a whole pound of chocolate coating, though...probably more like 3/4 lb. If you are going to make this, be sure to stir your baking soda in completely, even if it starts to foam up! The first time I tried this, the extreme foaming scared me a little, and I didn't stir the soda in enough. My family doesn't care for little pockets of baking soda in their fairy food candy ;)

I've made this twice.  The first time it came out a little burned.  Tasted like roasted marshmallow, which is not bad.  The second time I made it I only cooked it to 285 degrees and it was perfect.  LOVE IT!!  I did do the syrup in the cold water test.  Excellent.  Made me think of my childhood when I would ride my bike down to Jo's candy cottage in downtown manhattan beach with 10 cents and buy a huge piece...Ahh the memories.  Thank you so much for sharing...

I grew up in Wisconsin where this candy was available everywhere, even gas stations around the holidays.  After moving to Tulsa, I couldn't find these anywhere.  I was nervous to make these but after doing so...I will be sure to make these every holiday season.  I never knew it was so easy!!!  I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar to give it a bit more depth of flavor.  I heated the mixture to 300 degrees.  Be sure to remove from heat before mixing in the baking soda.  Also, BE SURE NOT TO SPREAD MIXTURE OUT...this will make the mixture hard and more like a brittle.

Perfect!  I love this stuff, it's one of my favorite Christmas-type candies and now I can make it myself!  I could not break it by hand, the pieces ended up being REALLY irregular (and really messy)so instead I used a steak knife to stab it, breaking of normal size pieces.  I chose to use semi-sweet chips (melted with shortening) instead of the confectioners coating.  I dipped half, planned on dipping the other half but the first half took too long to dry, warm kitchen I guess.  I'll definitely make this again!

This was a lot easier to make then I expected it to be  - the key is YES! Following the recipe exactly. I wouldn't do it without a candy thermometre. An excellent and I think unique taste when compared with many things we make in the home.

I worked in a chocolate factory for years - just a tip - fully cover your sponge candy with chocolate for best storage.  Even a small hole in the chocolate will make your sponge get stale very quickly.  I spent hours weeding out the uncovered sponge to put into the imperfect for sale pile. store in a cool place but never the refrigerator or freezer, should store well for months!

Wonderful, perfect recipe.  BETTER than the old fashioned stuff, as I always did not like the chocolate coating on the old stuff.  I just melt milk chocolate chips instead and it is a dream come true.  This is my mother's favorite candy and she loves that I can now make it for her homemade.

I followed the tips from Lisa K's review to a T and the Angel Food Candy turned out absolutely heavenly! I cannot believe how well it turned out...just like my grandmother's from years ago. I really had my doubts while I was waiting for it to reach to the correct temperature. The boiling mixture smelled pretty nasty and I seriously doubted it would even turn out. Make sure there are no small lumps in your baking soda before adding to the hot mixture. I have been searching for a recipe like this for ages. Thank you, Debbie!

I just finished making this candy. It's just how I remembered it. Perfection.  I followed the recipe exactly and other reviewers were right. You must be patient. It takes a while to reach temp. I dipped the candy half way in the chocolate. I will definetely be making more for the holidays. Mag

Fantastic recipe!  I have been wanting a recipe for Angel Food Candy for years.  Growing up in the midwest this was one of my favorite holiday treats and for the past few years my sister has been shipping it me because you cannot buy it in Florida.  Now I can make my own that tastes EXACTLY like the childhood treat I always had.  Defintely a simple and wonderful recipe.  I used Ghirardelli dark chocolate chips to dip it in.  Delicious!

This recipe is lots of fun!  Feels like a science experiment when you add the baking soda and it grows three times the size within seconds!  Husband doesn't like the dark syrup taste, so I tried light corn syrup.  Still tastes like campfire marshmallows (which I like, he doesn't) so I must be burning something even though I can't see it.  I dipped them 1/2 way in chocolate and different holiday sprinkles.

I'm not a fan of angel food candy.  I made this for my husband one Christmas after I found out how much it costs to buy it.  He was crazy for it and let all his friends know that I make the best angel food candy.  Now I have requests for it every year.

This recipe makes what I have commonly seen called honeycomb or sea foam candy.  The recipe is easy and tastes terrific!  It has been added to the list of required candy making for the holidays!  I agree with the previous comments that it is much better if dipped in real chocolate rather than the chocolate coating.

I found this candy extremely difficult to get 100% correct, but when I did, it was exactly like the angel food, fairy food, sponge candy, etc. that's sold near Christmas in Wisconsin.  Perfect chemistry in action here to get the candy perfect, that's not too hard or chewy, and melted in my mouth.  I tried the recipe exactly as written multiple times, but had the best results when I substituted half the sugar with brown sugar, and increased the amounts of vinegar and baking soda ever so slightly (by about 1/4 teaspoon).  I was always afraid to mix the candy too much, due to the need for bubbles and not smoothing into the pan, but you must stir it well for a few seconds,  after adding the baking soda.  My best attempt used light (not light on calories, just color) corn syrup, but I don't think that made the difference. I'm also not sure how much the use of brown sugar mattered; I think the use of extra vinegar and baking soda made a bigger difference, plus buying a digital candy thermometer and heating to 297°F before quickly moving on  Hope this helps others, because it is great!  Each time I used the oven trick, by placing the pan in an oven at 225F for ten minutes and then 170F for ten minutes, so it doesn't cool to quickly and drop.  I  fill the pan with parchment paper first, so it's easier to remove from the pan. Parchment paper is the trick to easy removal.  Candy temp is the most important to get just right for non-chewy, crunchy candy.

When I was a child (many, many years ago), my mother used to buy (and hide) this candy at the Dutch Mill Candy store.  When they closed their stores, she found it at a little neighborhood candy store.  I made this for old time's sake.  I made this recipe using about half light brown sugar and half granulated sugar.  The end result doesn't appear to be as thick as the pictures for this recipe but the taste is right on target.  I poured the cooked syrup into a pan lined with buttered non-stick foil (some people call me Mr. Monk).Thank you so much for posting this recipe it brought back memories.

My grandmother used to make this for her Christmas boxes I never realized how simple it really is. Followed directions to a t had everything prepared buttered pan lined with parchment, sifted baking soda. Also dipped in semi-sweet chocolate with a bit of shortening and it was exactly like I remembered. Also used Lisa K.'s tips will be adding it to my Christmas treat lists! Thank you

I grew up on this in Wisconsin, we bought it from the store and it was a favorite Christmas treat.  When we moved to Oklahoma when I was a teenager, no one had heard of it and it was not commercially available in any of the stores.  I was so glad I still had the recipe from my junior high Holiday Foods class, it is the same as this recipe.  It makes a great gift for our local friends since it is such a novelty here, everyone seems to fall in love with it!

OMG made this first time and it turned out perfect.  Used brwon sugar since I only had light corn syrup.  My kids love it and I can't wait to give it as gifts.  So easy gas stove and used 4-5.  Makes me remember my sibs and cousins eating this and it was spendy then.  One to add to your xmas candy file.  Did use my candy themoter I would suggest buying one they are not that much and you have it for years.  Enjoy Yum Yum give me some

This is by far the best sponge toffee recipe I have made. Only hint is to sift the baking soda first so there are no lumps in the sponge and I use parchment paper to line the pan. I doubled the recipe and got 2 1/2 pounds of weight after dipping in dark chocolate.

This Angel Food Candy is SO GOOD!  I love the candy bar version of the candy, and this tastes just like it!  Just a couple of things you might want to watch out for: First, it is really easy to burn the candy, so be patient and let it cook on low heat until it reaches about 300 F. If you have a candy thermometer it really helps!  Second, sifting the baking soda in help a lot. I got a couple chunks in there. . .Not good. You also want to let it cool off completely before coating in chocolate. I tried one piece when it wasn't completely cooled off and it was really chewy. It's not supposed to be chewy, it has to melt in your mouth and be light and airy. Other than that, it is the best candy I've ever had!

Very good recipe! I had a "blonde moment" when I first tried the recipe and accidentally used baking powder instead of baking soda...that definitely didn't turn out! But when I made it according to directions the second time, it turned out perfect! Thanks for the recipe!

For what's it worth, I thought the recipe was quite easy to do.  It was crunchy and tasted good, too!  (By the way, I used apple cider vinegar because I didn't have the normal stuff.  It smell weird cooking but the final product was fine.) This recipe is my first attempt at candy making so I think this recipe is fairly straight forward.  Just be sure to premeasure everything and make sure the pan is greased before you start.  A candy thermometer is very helpful to have.  With an electric range, keep an eye for any parts that's cooking to fast.  (When amber goes reddish, that means the syrup is starting to burn.) I found that once the temperature hits 300, pull the pot off the heat because the temp will still go up a bit before it starts to cool.  Overall, thanks for the great recipe!

This may not be the easiest thing to make, but they are so yummy it is worth every minutes of angst trying to get these out of the pan.  Reminds me of the store-bought candy that is nearly impossible to find these days.  YUM!

This was just deLisH!!  It was easy to make and the results were amazing. Where I come from we call this HoneyComb, but I do like the other name 'Angel Food Candy' & 'Fairy Food Candy'.  Thanks for a terrific and very well received recipe Debbie.

I was kind of nervous about making this because I've never made candy before, but it really was quite simple!  And, it's delicious!  It tastes a lot like Crunchies, a favorite of mine.  I took other reviewers advice and sifted the baking soda, and i think it really is important to be patient when it comes to the candy reaching 300 degrees.

Wow! This is my wife's favorite candy and when we were on vacation I paid $20 a pound for it! When we got home, I looked up the recipe and found this one, unbelievable how much this tasted like the expensive kind! We first dipped it in dark choclate and then after it dried, dipped it in milk choclate. We will never be buying this again! So easy to make and so good!

I'm giving this 4 stars because I'm sure it would be good if only I hadn't messed up.  The sentiment that "sometimes the purpose of our life is only to serve as a warning to others" applies here.

I'll warn ya.  If you don't have dark corn syrup you CANNOT, repeat CANNOT substitute molasses.  My first attempt ended up with a nice light crisy blop of carbon and my house smelling like burnt sugar for a couple days.  On the second attempt I followed the advice of a poster that suggested some additional time in the oven, which ended up with a tinge of burnt taste... enough to ruin the batch.  Bummer that, since the texture was wonderful and I could get a hint of the delicious candy that it should have been.  Oh well, I guess it's not my year for angel food.  Just wanted to lend a word to the wise.

Followed the exact directions and this turned out perfectly.  Just remember, when you pour it into the pan, don't stir it or mess with it - it will make it less airy.  Thanks for the recipe.

Just like in the stores, but better. Because we made it.  I tried this twice. The second time I made sure the temp. was 300 or higher.  And I it came out perfect. Fluffy and all.  But, next year I will make sure I have more chocolate to dip the whole piece of candy.

I love this candy! My grandma used to buy it when I was young, but I could never find it in the stores. My sister know a store that carries it at Christmas, however,she likes this much better.I have been making it for the last 3 years, for some reason this year the first batch was the best I have ever made. Too bad the other batches have not come out so great. Baking it does work very good but the taste seems a little off to me. I will keep making this for years, my family loves it.

I would actually prefer to rate this recipe at 2 stars, but feel that I should give the benefit of the doubt since I have never tried this candy before.  I thought the candy would be more light and airy.  Instead it was quite hard and difficult to chew.  The flavor was bland.  Thank you anyway Debbie.

I made this recipe a couple of times before I got it the way I wanted it. After reading other comments, here’s what I did: 1/2 cup white sugar, and 1/2 cup golden brown sugar instead of 1 full cup of white sugar. I heat mine to 295F and removed from heat, and then sifted the baking soda over the sugar mixture and stirred vigorously. I also then poured into a NON-BUTTERED 9x13” pan lined with parchment. I found that when I buttered the pan, I ended up with some gummy bits that were chewy rather than crispy. Trust me, you don’t need to butter parchment paper, it will peel away like nothing. Finally, I baked at 225F for 10 minutes and then lowered to 170F for an additional 10 minutes. I found this aided in the raising process. This all results in a light and crispy toffee that is excellent when dipped in melted milk chocolate!

I have made this one several times now and every time it comes out perfect. Fun to make too. Much less work than many other holiday candies i make with less clean up. Fellow makers should note that you can also line your glass baking dish with parchment paper and coat the paper for easier clean up and i like to ue a cutter to indent the candy softly as it cools to make it slightly easier to break apart. I also let mine get MOST of the way cool then pull the parchment of candy out and let it finish on a cutting board. I think break it in half at one of the indented lines and stick it back in the glass pan, parchment and all, to the "crack" into more manageable pieces for dipping. helps save on mess because otherwise it likes to kind of explode everywhere as you crack. Lastly, If you have too much of the pan filled or it doesn't crack correctly either A: you did not measure portions correctly B: your temperature was not exact (candy matters, it's Science more than anything and there is minimal wiggle room in Candy) or C: your baking soda was too old so it did not inflate properly. I find it is worth it to have a new candy thermometer every Holiday Season and start with fresh ingredients so I can be sure of the quality.

This was my first try at making this, actually I have never made any sort of candy before! It turned out awesome and was a very easy recipe to follow. I took all of Cara Huhman's advice and tips- thank you!! Will be making again soon!!

This is the same recipe my father-in-law gave me 35 years  ago. I use a 9x9x2 inch pan lined with parchment paper that is lightly buttered. When cool I use an elclectric serated knife to cut into pieces. Make three or more batches every Christmas!

I prefer it without the chocolate, but it's good either way.

Perfect! In western New York where we're from this is called sponge candy and it is a favorite of my husband's. In Florida where we live now there is nothing like it, he is very pleased that now I can make it for him and I'm pleased that it's not too hard or expensive to make! Thanks so much!

We used to buy this DELICIOUS honeycomb candy when we were stationed in Hawaii..  It was called Violet Crumble.   Could never find it here in Fla. but, when I searched on AR...I found it!! I followed some of the great tips...sifting baking soda, remove from heat quickly & put in oven for awhile on low...Boy oh boy, did it ever taste awesome!  Just like Violet Crumble!  I made it for my daughter for Christmas & she LOVED it!!!  Said it tasted just like the candy we used to buy!!!  Had to give it 5 stars  as was SO good!!

Like this "candy" and I've made it before. However, I made a discovery. Molasses and maple syrup combined is no substitute for corn syrup (which I thought I had, but didn't) I'll stick to the recipe.

I have made this recipe 3 times now, and everyone turned out different. ! of the 3 batches turned out ok, 2 of them were total failures. I don't know what is the right answer, but will keep trying.

I like this recipe, but always seem to burn any batch when I rely on a thermometer. Water test is best, and I find I remove it before it fully reaches the hard rack stage as the pot seems to keep cooking it while you mix in the baking soda. Is best made in the heaviest pot I own. I mix it more than the recipe says as I prefer small bubbles instead of big bubbly layers. Use a pan that's way bigger than what it says and gently spread with spoon to get half inch thickness perfect for dipping. Used a milk chocolate candy coating for dipping, and it was melt in your mouth. These were a big hit.

Made this recipe over the holidays and it turned out perfectly. No changes were required from the original recipe.  My candy thermometer was very helpful. I strongly recommend using one.

This recipe tastes great! I followed it exact and did the oven trick afterwards. I didn't realize I needed to sift the baking soda though so I think that's why mine came out much flatter than what I have seen in the store.

I had read a lot of the reviews, and I was a little skeptical.  I used dark Karo syrup and regular sugar...I let my candy themometer reach to 300...I read on another site to put the vinegar and bakng soda in last.....I stirred the vinegar in first, then quickly added the baking soda, poured in a greased pan, lined with tin foil..I then put in a 200 degree oven for ten minutes, and then lowered it to 175 for another ten minutes like Lisa K said..  it cooled quickly, I took a bite, and it was pretty hard.  I almost threw in the towel, but waited a little longer, it came out of my pan whole and I just broke the pieces with my hand. The middle was a little more like it should have been.  Put the pieces into melted chocolate with a little coconut oil on waxed paper.  Yum!  Next time I am going to try with brown sugar and perhaps a better chocolate.

I just made this for the third time:( The first time cooked to 300 on the candy thermometer and it was a mess and filled up my 10x13 pan up the sides and was so hard to try and break apart. I think I might have had temp a little too high, they said it tasted like burnt marshmallows.  The second time I tried cooking just under 300 and poured it onto a large pizza pan and was too sticky and not airy. I tried breaking in and put in a ziplock and it all stuck together. This third and final time I cooked to exactly 310 (slowly) I used the 10x13 pan again and it filled it up 3/4 the way up the sides...it looks glossy on the top but is full of holes and pockets when broken apart. It did not break easily either, it splintered apart and flaked instead of being in nice pieces for the most part, got some nicer ones.  It was good for having the ingredients on hand but feel like I wasted them. I give up on this one. The picture made me want to try it and it sounded fool-proof. Guess not for me anyway.
