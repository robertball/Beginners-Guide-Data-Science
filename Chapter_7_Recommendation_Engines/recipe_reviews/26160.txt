This recipe set perfectly and tasted great, even though I over-zested my lemon. 
After melting the butter and condensed milk I took the pot off the heat and mixed in the rest of the ingredients to make sure they didn't get too soft. I also greased the dish I pressed the mixture into with margarine, just to make sure the squares would come out clean when I cut them. 
If you are using smaller lemons perhaps it is better to use 2 instead of one - I used a large one and juiced it very well so the taste of lemon was excellent. 
To add to the sweetness (I have a sweet tooth)I drizzled the squares with some of the leftover condensed milk. It adds to the look of the dish as well. 
Overall, a satisfying recipe and I will probably make it again if I need to use up a lemon!

I couldn't get these to set up. After 24 hours in the fridge, they've got the consistency of fudge. Tastes good tho!

These came out a little moist but I think maybe they're supposed to be that way.  After zesting my lemon, I heat it up before squeezing the juice out, get more juice that way, might be why I was a little moist but the bars were fantastic.  Next time will try adding a few extra cookies to "dry" it up a bit.

Well..... after reading all the reviews I thought, I'd better stick to the recipe so its not too wet.  I used a med to lge lemon and put the finished product in the freezer to set fast.  It was delicious, very lemony (probably due to the lovely lemon I used).  When I went to do this review, I realised I'd left out the coconut!!  So it works well without the coconut also.  Next time I will remember to add it!!

This is the dessert I never knew I was always craving. Sweet, lemony, buttery, EASY. I think I'm in love. Followed the recipe exactly, but threw the pan in the freezer to speed up the setting.

I followed the recipe and it wasn't lemony at all, so the next time I added the juice of 4 lemons - much better! It didn't set (ate it with a spoon) but that's probably my fault for adding so much juice. I've also made this with ginger cookies and limes and it was superb!

Very tasty! Drizzled the top with condensed milk. Will make again and I think I'll try the lime and ginger as was suggested by another reviewer. Might try a tad less butter next time (1/3 c).

Tasted nice.. next time I would use more zest.  I think also a few more biscuits would help with the firmness... a little soft
