Yummy! My husband is diabetic and absolutely loved this recipe.  The cornmeal gives a nice texture and flavor.  Will definitely make these again.

These are absolutely awful.  I pride myself on my cookies and love to share with those at work, but I wouldn't even let these leave the house.  They have a horrible after taste and the lemon juice and cornmeal do not complement each other.  Find another recipe.
