I made the dough last night and tested a couple of cookies before letting the dough sit. They were excellent. I am making the rest today. I totally hacked the recipe but it's a great base to work from. I didn't have bourban so I used apricot preserves and added a little more milk instead also a tsp of rum flavoring. I only had one pound of raisins so I threw in a handful of dried cranberries. I didn't have dried pineapple at all so I added dates instead. The cranberries were ok but would probably not use them next time. They had quite a tart bite. I'm glad I didn't use a lot. The only thing wrong with the recipe is I think the "drop by tsp" is a typo. There is no way you could drop this chunky dough by the teaspoon. I'm using a big cookie dough scoop. I'm giving it a 5 stars because if this was easy to mess up I certainly would have done it. Even with all of the modifications this came out excellent. Thanks a bunch. A great holiday addition to my cookie trays.

Wonderful!! Huge kudos from the staff at my office. This recipe made so many cookies that not only did I feed the office but I also gave away platters to several neighbors and still had plenty for us. The taste is just incredible (and I really don't care for fruitcake). I'll be making these year after year after year after..... (thanks!)

I just came back to read my posted review and saw Olga's just below. Yes it is true that if you 'drop by teaspoons' you will get mini cookies. I dropped them by heaped Tablespoons and then formed them into shape because some cookies in the first batch fell apart. I only made half the recipe and got over 90 cookies but the amount you get depends on how much dough you portion for one cookie. I thought they did look pretty - like homemade cookies and the cookies are chock full of fruits & nuts it can only remind you of fruitcake. Besides this is a cookie and not a cake. I still am not sure how they are supposed to taste but I am happy with the results.

These are delicious and the only cookie I made this year that will NEED to reappear on my cookie tray each holiday season. I do like fruitcake so maybe I'm biased but the sweet nutty candied-cherry-and-pineapple dessert makes the holidays and this cookie is even better than the cake. The nuts have that amazing toasted flavor after baking on the sheet and the cookie size (I did go to about 1.5/2 TBSP dough) is just great for individual portion control. It is also great for people wary of fruitcake: they think "Oh I'll take one it's just a couple bites" and before they know it someone new is hooked. I made the dough exactly as written (well no golden all standard raisins) and see no need to change it. A cup of whiskey seemed like a lot and the raw dough smelled strongly of it: no problems after baking however just a deeper flavor to the cookie that we find indistinguishable as whiskey. I was also tempted to skip the step of chilling the dough overnight in the fridge but it can only help the flavors and the chill is important to help the chunky dough stay together. Making the recipe as written I did NOT have issues with crumbling I did however make sure each drop cookie was nice and compact in the scoop using my fingers as neccessary to pack the dough. Pretty on the plate and oh-so-easy: don't be afraid of this one! Thanks for sharing:)

I made the dough for this recipe 3 nights ago and baked up a trial batch 2 nights ago. Because of the various comments that the cookies didn't hold together I chopped up most of the fruits which made them a lot stickier. I chopped them to varying degrees and left most of the raisins whole for more interesting texture. I also chopped the nuts. Finally I packed the dough together tightly before refrigerating. In the end the cookies held together quite nicely. (I let them cool a little before taking them off my baking sheet - that may have helped too...) I tried various shapes and sizes for the cookie. It bakes up pretty much exactly as you put it on the baking sheet so the prettier the shape you put down the prettier the cookie will be. My favorite was a standard 1.5" diameter cookie dough scoop. It was easy and quick to scoop kept the dough packed together automatically and made nice rounded ball-shaped cookies. Finally I used some standard mixed candied fruit in place of some of the cherries and pineapple just for convenience and that worked fine. I think the cookies are amazing can't stop eating them and will probably make them every Christmas now. But at my holiday party no one ranted and raved about them so I'm giving them 4 stars instead of 5. Of course this was not a fruitcake-loving crowd...

I used this recipe last year because I ran out of time to make fruitcakes. I got nothing but praise from the people I gave them to. My husband and daughter who think you have to have fruitcake at Christmas were even satisfied by these and want them again this year.

This recipe is easy to prepare and easy to customize. I do not like bourbon so I used water with a lot of vanilla extract. I also did not have enough raisins or the pineapple and just used extra fruitcake mix to make up most of the difference. This made WAY more than 4-6 dozen when dropped by teaspoons but it was a nice size cookie. I wouldn't make them any bigger. Now I just have plenty to share. I do not like fruitcake AT ALL but would actually eat these. My husband LOVED them. I hope they last till Xmas!

This recipe is an old one. I got my version from my mother. At least 50 years ago. I use candied fruit mix and no pineapple. Also use 3 teaspoons soda dissolved into the milk and 1-1/2 t of nutmeg clove & cinnamon along with 3/4 t of allspice and 1 Cup of nuts. We give them in tins as Christmas presents to our families and friends. Always a favorite at parties.

I have made these in the past and they are DELICIOUS! I lost the recipe but I would add soda cloves and allspice. Take out the golden raisins and chop the candied fruit into small pieces as I can't stand the big chunks. Everybody loves these! I can't wait to make them again for Christmas.

Made these for Christmas too close to Christmas to get the "aged flavor" so they may become an incredible New Year's cookie who knows? I used sweetened cranberries golden raisins dried mango (we live in California) and pecans. I used Spiced Rum instead of the bourbon which I think was a good move. I also would put coconut in next time as there is somewhat of a tropical theme working with my fruit selection. The cookies do not expand and 1 large tablespoon seemed to make a good sized cookie. If you are looking for a fruitcake tasting cookie this is not it but it is interesting and seems to bear individual adaptations well. I think next time I will also try adding some cinnamon as they could use a little more zip. All in all a fairly healthy safe cookie that my boys ate for breakfast. Two was plenty!

This is a great recipe although I did tweak a bit. My main suggestion is to really ramp up the spices. I use a TON of cinnamon ground cloves nutmeg and dried ginger plus some vanilla. Probably at least a half tablespoon of cinnamon for example! I used brandy instead of bourbon and skipped the pineapple. I just used a thing of mixed glace fruit from the grocery store. I also added dried dates that I cut up. I made these for my dad in my unending quest to find cookies that he likes and that my mum and I (the dieters) don't like! He loves fruitcake so these were perfect. He actually rhapsodized for ages about how they were like the "spice cookies" his mum used to make. So yes - definitely a cookie that will appeal to fruitcake lovers!

My mother-in-law made these every Christmas but now has Alzheimers so thought I would try them. My mother passed away this past November and her favorite bed time drink was Hazelnut Kahlua and since I don't drink it I used it instead of the bourbon. May I just say that I really liked this version better and maybe Mom is smiling down at me as my family enjoys them this year.

Great! As good as fruitcake! Yes I am a fan of those little dense bricks that are circulated at the holidays. These cookies were an easy and non-intimidating way to distribute the candied fruit goodness. Love the spiciness of these...I wouldn't change a thing!

These cookies came out great. I didn't want to use the bourbon so I substituted 1 cup of almond milk with about a teaspoon of rum extract in it. The recipe is very forgiving. I used less sugar (about 1 3/4 cups) and a mix of 4 lbs. of dried fruit plus whatever nuts I had here. I'm sure it was less than 2 lbs. I got well over 80 cookies using my 1 oz. scoop. Delicious. Everyone has loved them. Thanks this is a keeper.

"72 servings drop by teaspoonfuls". If dropping by teaspoonfuls what is a serving because my cookies are like 2 heaping tablespoon sizes to make 72 cookies? I was excited about making the cookies but was very disappointed as I found they fall apart don't look pretty and really have no taste of fruitcake.

I did not care for this recipe at all. The cookies overall had a very plain flavor and I didn't like the texture of the dough either. The dough was way too light and airy to resemble fruitcake very much and like I said they tasted very plain to me. After buying all the expensive ingredients I was quite disappointed. Maybe they might be better if the cinnamon and nutmeg were almost doubled and perhaps add some allspice too. Also maybe if you poured some boiling water over the raisins first to plump them up and then soaked them for a few hours in some bourbon to flavor them up it might help. Maybe add some chopped dates and/or prunes too. But as is I wouldn't make these again. Sorry.

This recipe was not sweet enough and too dry. Cookies crumbled on the cookie sheet. I added flour and brown sugar and a little milk to the recipe to get the ingredients to hold together during cooking. Would not use this recipe again but now must use since I have about 35 tied up in ingredients.

Outstanding! Most of my family does not like fruit cake except for my mother and I. So I tried to sneak them by as cookies with this recipe. Not only did it work but they wanted 2nds. I cut the recipe in 1/2 worried only my mother and I would be the only consumers. I made 48 large cookies w/ 1/2 a batch. now a seasonal regular. thanks mary lou

Oh my goodness are these good. Addictive little taste treats for sure! I rolled the dough in 4 parchment paper logs (sprayed plastic wrap will work as well) and refrigerated before slicing and baking. That method gives a rounder even cookie and the fruit shows through like cut glass. As other reviewers noted these do not spread at all so how you put them in is how they will come out. No need to change the recipe one bit but...but I did add a little bit of salt vanilla and baking soda because I felt the butter and flour would be lonely without them. Not sure it made any difference though! And yes this makes a very big batch of cookies.

a WONDERFUL recipe! I baked about half of these the day after I mixed them up. Due to schedule conflicts it was another 3 days before I finished baking the rest of the cookies. The second batch I baked were even better than the first! I will definitely keep this to use year after year!

I made these cookies only making half the recipe and still got the amount stated. I put these in a tin and they were good for a long time. I ate only a couple each morning with my coffee. So good. They will be everything you wanted. Make sure you follow the steps as described.

for the first time ever I made fruit cakes this christmas. this is one of 12 different recipies that I worked with and the best. I used dried cherries instead of candied cherries and all pecans in all versions and made first batch in early Dec. but my grandkids did not like the boozey taste. had adults picking the crumbs from the plate. second batch used apple juice instead of bourbon and everyone liked but still too crumbly. third batch I halved the fruit and nuts and these were the bomb. none have lasted long enough to hit peak flavor as they start on them out of the oven. do know if I can hide this next batch they will taste even better as the last ones in the jar are the absolute best.

I felt I had to rate these due to the very expensive ingredients......I doulbed the recipe (4 LBS. of nuts!) to take to a bake sale and as gifts......followed the recipe EXACTLY. Just took the first and second batches out of the oven. They do not hold up at all! The dough was fine going on the cookie sheet.....but when I try to take them off......they just crumble into a soft MESS. I bake quite often.....and this is the first time I've ever had such a disaster! The taste is fine.....but DO NOT BAKE THESE to give as gifts or to show to anyone. Sorry.

Tasty. Quite a bit of fruit. I think the next time I make this I will decrease fruit so there is a little more cookie batter. Also when this recipe popped up it was for 72 servings. That makes a HUGE amount. I think a half recipe would be more to the expected size cookie batch quantity.

I have never had fruitcake in my life nor have I had fruitcake cookies. I have no idea what they are supposed to taste like. They are so full of fruit and nuts they fall apart very easily so I was thinking I put too much fruit and nuts in. I reread the recipe and I don't think so. I did sub other dried fruit because I couldn't find candied gruit other than red cherries. They're all right if you like candied fruit. I actually think less fruit and nuts would be better and I think I prefer dried fruit as opposed to candied. Thanks!

I LOVE this recipe!!! Last year I made it but cut the ingredients in half and it still made 72 cookies. This year I bought enough ingredients to make a full batch!! These are the best!! The only change I made was to buy mixed candied fruit instead of just using cherries & pineapple. The only advice I have for those making this for the first time is to use an extra large bowl to coat the fruit in flour and after you mix the other ingredients pour the dough into the bowl with the fruit. It is easy to cut in the dough if you use a butter knife. Much easier to mix than with a spoon. I used a gigantic Tupperware bowl with a lid. Be sure to follow all instructions & don't leave out any ingredients. These were the best cookies ever!! Thank you Mary Lou!! I am sending some to family out of town & these will be on my must have list every year!!

Made the recipe.. the recipe does not state whether to chop the fruit walnuts and pecans before adding to the wet ingredients as for using the fruits and the nuts whole..... the recipe makes about 144 cookies barely holding the fruits and nuts to gether more like clumps..

I love love love this recipe!!! Did few modifications and this will definitely be a keeper! I soaked dried fruits in brandy for few hours then coated it with 1 cup flour. Used only 1 cup of nuts... I used asst. of dried fruits which means I added dried apricots cranberries fruit cake mix candied fruit so total all dried fruits was 4 lbs!!! Be careful because these cookies are so addicting n with a kick;-)

I made this eggzaktly according to the recipe and I am very pleased with both the flavor and the texture although I expected more flavor from a cup of bourbon. I may try sherry next year. I was pleased that the cookies retained most of their ball shape in cooking and did not flatten out. See my pic.

Had hunted for a recipe similar enough to mom's. This worked, even subbing out gluten free flour blend!

I only changed one thing and that was because I didn t have any nutmeg. I used cardamom instead and they were soooo delicious. Even my pastor who has publicly said how much he hates fruitcake took a bite and said I don t hate it! and ate the rest of it. This is a winner. The dough is difficult to work with when first out of the fridge but I used a 1-1/2 inch scooper and that gave me even portions (9 dozen) Then I took a glass and wet the bottom to flatten the cookies a bit because they basically will bake how you put them in. Thank you for a great recipe!

Way too much fruit and nuts and not enough cookie dough. Flavor was VERY BLAND - what a waste of ingredients and time.

I made the recipe as is. No changes or tweaks. It turned out WELL! In fact everyone I gave them to RAVED about how good they were. This is a recipe keeper in my house. In fact I have been asked by 3 peeps to share with them.;)

Absolutely delicious. The taste of these cookies is the closest I've ever come to reproducing the flavor of my grandma's fruitcake. These cookies are going on my Christmas cookie list to make year after year.
