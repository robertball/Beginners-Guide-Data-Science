These were really good!  They were a tad bit dry and crumbly, but not so much that it detracted from the yummy chocolate-peanut taste.  Just eat them with a big glass of milk. :-)

I didn’t make any changes at all and followed the recipe exact. After I leave this review I am deleting this recipe off of the site. I feel the peanuts taste burnt the whole cookie just tastes burnt and they weren’t. I thought they would taste like peanut butter cups between the chocolate and peanut butter but not at all.This recipe was a big disappointment and a waste of time and ingredients.

I made these today and they were absolutely fabulous  even though I didn't have the chocolate chips on hand. 
 Definitely a favorite.
