Okay. A few things: First, holy butter, Batman! Scale it back to a tablespoon and a half. I promise, it's plenty. Secondly, these cook up in less than a minute each. I dropped two of them in the pot and turned around -- they were black. The dough is so thin that you'll want to cook these one at a time. Tastewise, these are delicious. A nice, quick weekday dessert. You could even do the apples ahead of time.

I did scale back the butter a bit but not that much. Great idea. Don't use the small biscuits, hard to form. Next time I think as I am rolling and flattening the biscuits, I will sprinkle with a little cinnamon sugar mix. They cook quick or I had my oil too hot. Anyhow, they turned out fantastic and my kids cannot wait until the next time. What made it really great is that the apples just came from the tree within a few hours. Yum. Thanks Mary

As I doing up apple sauce and had a bit left over this was a great way to use it up and it turned out just fantastic.  I used my own recipe for the biscuts and never put any butter in the spple mix.  I did have a couple blow out but that was because the edges were not quite sealed, my fault.  But will make again maybe with a different fruit.  Thanks.

Really simple and quick to make the apple filling.  I did NOT fry them.  I baked them....came out just fine.  I didn't want the extra oil.  Very tasty.

We rated this a 5/5 because it was really good and we would recommend this as a dessert or lunch, It was also fun to make.
