Holy cow! This is the most amazing dish I have ever made. And so so easy. Yum. A couple things I did differently: Instead of throwing the remaining marinade out, I poured it in the baking dish. And instead of pounding the chicken, I cut the breasts in half, put the stuffing on top of one half and put the other breast on top of that. Seriously delicious.

Nice recipe. I added spinach to the filling.  Also, I did not bak it but browned it then with some chicken broth, I stirrred the little bits from the pan and simmered for about an hour..You can also add white wine ( or my favourite - sherry )to taste to the sauce as it reduces while cooking.  Cover for first 45 min and uncover to let sauce reduce for last 15....much more savory than just baking.

Really really good.  I didn't have olives so I added capers to the cheese mix; it was awesome.  Was a bit salty and not really cheesy enough for me, next time I think I'll add mozzerella for more creamyness and not add salt to anything.

Another Outstanding recipe!  This one got RAVE reviews from my husband and step-son.  They couldn't stop raving about it.  It's definitely a keeper.  I didn't have "Greek Seasoning" so I searched out a recipe and made my own. I accompanied with chicken with asparagus that I drizzled with olive oil, dry white wine, garlic salt and black pepper and roasted them, and long grain wild rice.  Scrumptious!  HIGHLY recommended.  You won't be sorry.

My husband and I loved this recipe. After eating it he was already requesting for me to make it again. 
ONLY thing I had to do was lengthen the cooking time from 30 minutes to about 45-50 minutes. I am making this recipe again. Thanks!

Delish!  I used the kalamata olives per the recipe (even though they are optional).  This was absolutely delicious, and definitely company-worthy.  I will admit I added some crumbled crispy bacon to the mix - it added some real snap to the recipe!  Who doesn't love bacon?  Personally, I will omit (or at least cut down) on the red pepper next time.  I felt it was overpowering with the other really fantastic flavors in this recipe.  Definitely a keeper.  5 out of 5 stars.  Thanks for the great recipe!  I will put it on our rotation.  Super easy and pretty too!

This is a company worthy dish! It tastes delicious and it's also very elegant looking. I wanted to cut the calorie count down a bit, so I only used 1.5 tbs of olive oil for the marinade and use only 2 ounces of feta (and it was plenty!). To the filling, I added some chopped roasted red pepper and some fresh oregano and thyme I wanted to use up. This was fantasic and I'll make again when I have someone to impress :)

Wow, this is fantastic!  I followed all the directions and measurements,(using three boneless, skinless breast), and the chicken was perfectly done at 30 minutes.  I served it with Boozy Rice with Nuts and Berries, also from this site.  I will be making this chicken often!

Very delicious and beautiful presentation!  Perfect for guests or for a gourmet dinner at home.  I followed the recipe exactly and it had a great balance of flavors.  I served it with couscous and a greek salad and I felt so proud of myself!  My husband doesn't eat olives and he ate the entire dish with gusto.  Excellent recipe!

It was great.  I omitted olives (because I'm not an olive person).  But it's super easy to prepare and it looks professional when you are done!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this as written.  I found the flavors were wonderful.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was that I found it was a little dry.  I think I would have liked it better if there were a light sauce of some sort to go with it.  Great recipe, though!

Unbelieveably Easy and Delicious!  I couldn't find greek seasoning so I made my own - used an about.com recipe.  Delicious and made just enough for this recipe.  Sauce/marinade is a perfect balance of spices and lemon.  However, I love strong flavors so you may want to use less lemon if you enjoy more subltle flavors.  Followed recipe exactly.  Cooking times were spot on.  Served with Boozy Rice w/ nuts - recipe available on this site - and a salad.  PERFECT MEAL.

This is a very tasty dish. It is easy to prepare and makes a nice presentation. I split and butterflied my breasts after marinating them for over an hour. They rolled up easily and the filling stayed inside. Instead of placing them in the oven, I browned them first on the stovetop and then finished them in the oven at 350 for about 20 - 25 minutes. After removing them to a platter, I deglazed the pan juices with some white wine, then reduced it until syrupy. I skipped the roasted pepper garnish since I didn't think it would add much flavor. To me, the key is the reduction at the end, served over slices of the chicken.

Nice marinade! I cut open the chicken breasts and put filling in, then held together with toothpicks. I browned each side in a little olive oil before finishing in the oven. Will make it again for sure.

I love, love, love this recipe! Omitted the dill and parsley - but only because I didnt have any on hand. Already made this twice, and plan on making it again for dinner tomorrow. Love the fact that I can eat it cold or warm. 1st time I made it with green olives and felt it was a bit too salty withe the feta. 2nd time, I made it with sliced black olives and thought it was better. Cheap and inexpensive recipe that is easy to customize to your own tastes. I will make over and over again!

I thought that this recipe was very good.  I make a similar version using sun dried tomatoes (packed without the oil), goat cheese, shallots, garlic and fresh basil that is very tasty (and for those health concious individuals) only 7 grams of fat and 296 calories.

Feta Sun-dried Tomato Stuffed Chicken Haiku: "Easy, elegant. Symphony of Greek flavors. Packed in chicken breast." It was an AR Greek night as I used "Greek Spice Rub" in the marinade (marinated the chicken for 4 hrs.), and served the exquisite chicken over baby spinach that I drizzled in "Absolutely Fabulous Greek/House Dressing." My only disappointment was that I didn't have roasted red peppers to drape over the chicken, and that I just barely over-cooked the chicken (just a touch), but otherwise, the presentation of this entree was beautiful and the taste - wow! I was not expecting to like it so much. I honestly can't think of anything that I'd change about it except having some roasted peppers on hand next time around.

YUMMY!!! I made this last night and it was pretty simple for the taste that it gave. i did change a few things. i added garlic and artichoke hearts to the stuffing and left out the olives and red peppers. i also used greek salad dressing for the marinade. i think the trick is to pound out the chicken before you marinade. very flavorful. will definitely make again!!!

This meal was delicious but I did make some changes.  I used goat cheese instead of feta and instead of spending too much time stuffing the chicken I laid the pieces in a casserole dish and added the goat cheese/pepper/tomato mixture over top.  I also served it over orzo, it came out so juicy so it was really good poured over top (rice would have been good too).

This was very good and surprisingly, the red peppers add a lot. They are very rich, one piece of chicken is probably enough for two people depending on the size of your breasts.

This was by far the best recipe I've made from this site!!!  Great flavor and very filling.  The only thing I would have changed would be to use a little less stuffing because a lot of the filling came out of the seam.  Will definately make again and can't wait to impress some guests with this recipe!

Great flavors. I added artichoke hearts to the feta mixture, and it was a great color with the black olives and tomatoes.  Instead of using toothpicks I wrapped each chicken breast in foil before baking, pouring a little of the leftover marinade over each breast before closing the foil. They stayed very moist, and made for a very pretty dish.

WOW!!! Talk about tasty, easy to make and so very impressive to look at! I have made this twice and once used black olives and then used kalamata olives. The kalamata olives give the dish an extra kick. Both were delicious, but the kalamata olives provided the added flavor boost. I did not add the roasted bell peppers on top.

This was very tasty.  Instead of making the marinade I used Greek salad dressing which I always keep on hand.  I left out the olives b/c they aren't my fave.  The chicken was a little messy to fold up and secure and it didn't want to brown.  I stuck it under the broiler and boy, it messed up my oven.  But it tasted good!

This is sooooo good. To cut down on the fat I used reduced fat mozzarella (don't like feta) and sun dried tomatoes packed in water. I also added fresh spinach. Easier than it looks and really good. Don't like kalamata olives, so I didn't add them.

I really liked this recipe, but would recommend that you not make the mistake I made, and that was to use fat-free feta cheese - it made it dry.  (Either that or I should have removed it from the oven earlier than 30 minutes.)  Note that I used the "Greek Seasoning" recipe on this site for this recipe.  It makes a little less than 2 Tbl., but it's not even noticed.  Instead of pounding the chicken breasts, I bought a package of "thin chicken breasts" (saved me some trouble, and it was perfect!).  I also  marinated the chicken overnight in a Ziploc bag (would do that again!).  I served this with "Fatoosh" from this site, and it was a nice complement.  Thanks for the recipe!  I will be trying this one again!

it was pretty delicious. i butterflied the chicken breasts rather than pounded them. in retrospect i think it would be better to pound them out. this makes wrapping the tomatoes and such A LOT easier. i added in some rosemary twigs in the wrapping which made it awesome. I also through in some chunks of garlic while marinating the chicken. Overall this dish was a huge hit with my girlfriend

Made this and Company Couscous (from this site) last night with a great friend and then watched Julie & Julia.  Here are some things we changed: 1). Rather than pounding the chicken, we split it and then stuffed the chicken breasts with the filling. 2). We needed to increase the baking time by about 10-15 minutes due to the thickness of the meat.  3). Made our own "greek seasoning": 1T oregano, 1T dried garlic minced, 2t cumin, 1t paprika, 1t pepper, 1/4 t salt.  Very flavorful!

Have made this dish several times now and have always gotten rave reviews every time!  My company always ask for the recipe and even request it for their next visit:)  For the greek seasoning I used another recipe off of here that works well.  Usually serve it with roasted greek potatoes and a salad. Once the chicken is done being marinaded in the lemon juice mixture I always pour the remaining juice over the chicken before baking.  One tip is to make sure you don't over cook the chicken but other than that a pretty fool proof recipe that is sure to please even your pickiest eaters.  My kids love this dish and their ages range from teenage down to toddlers:)

This came out delicious! I didn't have Greek seasoning so I used Italian instead. I also left out the lemon juice/zest to suit my family's likes. I bought sun dried tomato paste from the local supermarket and it worked like magic! The end result was delectable and looked like it should be served at a restaurant!

Great flavor combination.  Pounding the chicken is kind of tedious, but necessary to get it thin enough to wrap around the filling.  Otherwise the filling seeps out (but still tastes good!).  This recipe is a keeper.

This is always a hit. It's easy to make and has a wonderful presentation for dinner. I also add capers to the feta, sun dried tomato, and kalamata olive mix. For a side dish, someone submitted "Greek-style Potatoes" recipe on the website, and they are a great accompaniment.

The kalamata olives were a bite over powering and added a little bit of a salty flavor.  If I were to make his again, I would probably only use 4 or 5 olives instead of 10.

Really liked this dish! The only thing i would do the next time is add a little less lemon. It was a little bit too lemony for my taste. I didn't have Greek seasoning so I made my own and I also used light mozzarella and a lot less oil to cut on the calories

Very good. I found it a little heavy on the lemon but it may be because I used chicken tenders so they absorbed the marinade more. I didn't have sun-dried tomatoes or olives so I used roasted red peppers and omitted the olives. I added spinach into the stuffing as well.
To stuff I put one tender on the bottom, put the stuffing on top and then added another tender on top of that and secured with toothpicks.
I served with rice with chopped spinach & roasted red peppers.

This is indeed a *wow* good dish.  There are some serious good flavor combinations going on here.  I cut back on the olives to about 1/2 as I'm very sensitive to them, although in the right amount they are wonderful, and left off the red pepper.  Roll these up, brown in butter, toss in the oven and serve with couscous and asparagus.   Serious YUM!

This was very delicious. I cut down on the amount of marinade and seasoning as it seemed like more than necessary. I had scaled it to serve 4 and it did not scale very successfully. We left out the optional olives as they were going in the salad, and also the red pepper strips. I think there is enough flavor already without those additions. I will make this one again. Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

I don't know what  was so good about this recipe , to us it was just OK.  There are so many, much better, chicken recipes out there. I had four  boneless  chicken breasts, that I pounded and stuffed and rolled.    I must say they were sloppy, no matter how hard I tried to  get the stuffing in.   I had enough stuffing for four.  It still  leaked out.   I would not make them again.  But, they were very tender and not dry.  I served them with a wild rice casserole that I made.  Not  the package wild rice mixture.  I think it was the Celebration Rice Casserole from this website.    One thing I would like to add, I wish people would suggest what to serve the main course with. That is with all of the recipes that people rate.    It would be so helpful. I don't  think I will make this one  again.  Also , It is  not a cheap recipe to make.  Give me a good Italian Chicken Parmesean, from All recipes.
Like a dummy I made it a second time without reading my  review.  I don't like it at all.  Will not make it again and will  remove it from my recipe box. My husband didn't comment at all, but he didn't finish his.  Ugg..

Delicious with a capital D.  Tender, juicy, and wonderful.  We made it WITH the olives and it exuded Mediterranean flavor.  Awesome meal!

Made this for Valentine's Day for the first time ever, and it turned out perfectly!! It's pretty strong flavoring, but we like that so it went over very well.  We even had some leftovers that were delicious warmed up! Surprisingly easy and definitely worth it.

I doubled the recipe and left out the olives, but my husband and I thought it was quite good.  I think I probably would have given it five stars, but I filled the chicken too full of the feta cheese mixture and it was a little overpowering.

wow just wow.. this was awesome.. very well balanced.. i doubled the recipe, used the kalamata olives but not the roasted red pepper and halved the olive oil.. our chicken breasts were on average 13-14 oz each so we just used two.. i followed Ceejay's advice and saved the marinade but used it on some pasta and added some greek yogurt to it.. also used their advice to cut the breasts in half and then stuff in between.. it was more of a slit, but it saved us pounding the chicken.. we used the Greek Seasoning Blend recipe on this site for the greek seasoning.. since the breasts were bigger it took closer to 45 minutes to completely cook.. ty so much for the recipe

Excellent! Easy to make and my 6 year old evev loved it. I didn't roll it up, just piled the fixing on top, laid red pepper strip over it and put it in the oven. It was so good. Will make again!

I really liked the stuffing ... could of eaten it all up before stuffing the chicken! I found the marinade a bit too sour, lemony. I will make it again.

I decided to make this last night and I'm glad I did. It was extremely easy, but looked very impressive! I took the advice of another reviewer and poured the extra marinade over the chicken before putting it in the oven. I also added a generous amount of chopped fresh basil to the tomato/cheese mixture. I'd definitely make this again.

Incredible! I made this last night. I sliced the chicken breasts in half and they were so rich that one was enough. I made this with a cold Greek orzo salad with similar ingredients and it paired perfectly. I will absolutely make this again!!

I had to make some substitutions because of what I had on hand. I used vinegar for the lemon juice, Italian seasoning for the Greek seasoning, added some lemon pepper since I didn't have any zest, tomato paste (1/2 can) instead of the tomatoes, and 1tsp of oil from my olives. It was still sensational. I think my substitutes kept the heart of the recipe. The instructions were good but I had to cook almost 40 mins to get my chicken thoroughly cooked. Delicious and my husband could not stop raving about it.

My boyfriend and I tried this last night.  I LOVED it and my boyfriend enjoyed it.  He isn't a huge fan of Feta cheese.  He suggested a little less feta a little more tomato. (He finished everything on his plate).

Pretty much the BEST thing I have ever cooked and my boyfriend agrees. I made this last night the only things different I did was I excluded the red pepper and in the marinade I added some light italian salad dressing. I dont think anything could have made this recipe better. I am almost tempted to make it again tonight. Everyone in the house loved it. would give 10 stars if I could!!! :)

Delicious and pretty enough for company.  The feta and sun dried tomatoes alone and cooked down is very salty, though. I  would like to try again (the juice is delicious)  but would add something to the feta stuffing to offset the saltiness... maybe mayo or another cheese or spinach. Definitely worth trying again,to alter to our tastes.

I loved this recipe! The marinade was simple and excellent, and the combination of feta, sun-dried tomatoes and kalamata olives is, well, classic and much loved here :)! I had never thought of combining these with chicken, though. I now thank you for the wonderful idea! And thanks to bellydancer from AR exhcange who suggested this dish as well.

This is always a hit. It is my go to recipe for taking to a family with a new baby, who has someone in the hospital or who had a recent death in the family. I have also made it as a layered casserole in a pinch, which doesn't look nearly so elegant, but the taste is just as awesome. I serve it with Elegant Orzo with wilted spinach and pine nuts from this site and a Greek salad, or Green Beans with Cherry Tomatoes (also from All Recipes site.) Everyone thinks you are a great cook when you serve this, and it's really easy.

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!  I agree with the other reviewers that this dish is perfect for entertaining!  I let the chicken marinate all day and also added sauteed spinach to the feta mix.  I am so glad that i double the recipe because i will have leftovers for tomorrow!

Delicious! Like another reviewer, I saved the extra marinade and poured it in the baking dish. The chicken came out so moist and tender! I'm a beginning cook and this was an easy recipe. My family loved it!:)

Delicious and easy to make with not a lot of cleanup! I'm not a fan of feta cheese, but the cheese did not turn out as overpowering as I expected. It was quick and delicious enough for my husband to have seconds!

I love allrecipes! My best friend sent this one to me and I'm so glad she did! I made it for dinner tonight and both my husband and I can't get over how good it was. I did exactly what the recipe called for and decided to add the olives....NO need to change anything. Delicious as is! This one will definitely be made over and over again! Thanks Alyssa :)

wow, I have been making this thinking it was the result of my own experiment! so glad to see other people have come with this recipe too, its delicious!  Mine, however, is alot simpler - just chicken, feta, sun-dried tomatoes (with a bit of their oil) and some oregano. That`s all! Quick and amazing!

I wanted to make a special Sat. night dinner for my boyfriend since his new job hours do not allow us have dinner together during the week. This was Sooooo good and simple to make! I preped most of it in the morning. I added garlic and oragno to the marinade and the filling. I took the advise of another reviewer and made fatoush. What a great change! This is a keeper! I do a fund raiser for my woman's group by selling chances for a meal that I cook and deliver. This will be a great addition to the choices in the "dinner for 2" menu.

This was good, but the chicken turned out really dry. I think the sun-dried tomatoes and feta cheese really absorbs all the chicken's juices.

The recipe tastes wonderful and I'd definitely make it again BUT tastes like it's missing something.  Maybe more pepper?

Excellent recipe! The chicken turned out so nice and tender. I made this dish exactly as written but omitted the olives because I don't like it.

Very tasty! I made this for my boyfriend and used tofu instead of chicken to make mine vegetarian, which worked just as well. I thought that the roasted pepper strips stuck on top were a bit pointless though.

Delicious! I made this for dinner last night. I really don't like having to use toothpicks so I chose to use thicker breasts and cut pockets in each prior to marinating. Marinated in the fridge about an hour, stuffed the breasts using Mediterranean flavored feta, poured extra marinade over the tops of the chicken, and baked about 40 min. Everyone agreed this was very good!

One of the best meals I have had. We didn't use the olives as we don't like them. Even without them, the chicken was delicious
