Instead of butter heat some olive oil, add 1 chopped tomato cooking until soft.  In a bowl combine the eggs, feta and a pinch of oregano and pour into the pan with the tomato mixture.  Recommended that you don't add any salt.  It's a favourite in our house and very tasty!

I love feta cheese, so I had to try this.  I'm so glad I did because it was delicious!  Like others, I added some onion and tomato plus a dash of oregano.  My husband is a traditional scrambled egg kinda guy so I had this all to myself.  It was great with multi-grain toast!

I made several egg recipes this morning. This was good but I really liked "Feta Eggs" better because of the addition of chopped tomato and onion.

My son loves greek-style eggs, but we always sweat a little diced onion in the pan first and add in a bit of baby spinach just before serving. I'll sometimes add a few chopped black olives as well

Good way to use up some feta.  I also added spinach & black olives.  The olives were a bad choice.

This was excellent!  Simple, quick, and healthy.  I used margarine though, and I pan-grilled half red onion and a small clove of minced garlic.. before adding the eggs.  So yummy!  Thank you for the idea!

These were good but I thought that the feta overpowered the eggs a bit. Next time I will reduce to 1/4 of a cup and perhaps add some diced tomatoes. I substutued milk for the water and didnt add salt because as the recipe states the feta is salty on its' own.

Great recipe to use and tailor to what you like.  I started with some chopped fresh tomatoes, 1 chopped green onion, chopped red pepper and I stirfied it in the pan. I used the three eggs with the required water and about 1/4 cup of the feta cheese.  I also added oregano.  Lots of this these ideas are from suggestions from other cooks but my comment is to add that this is a great starter recipe - dream it and create whatever taste you like.  Kudos.  Great basic recipe.

One of my all time favorites for breakfast. I keep all the ingredients on hand and make this at least once a week. It may sound odd but don't knock it until you try it... marinated artichoke hearts. Add a couple diced up to the eggs for the ultimate mediteranian breakfast. Serve on fresh French bread.

As written, this is awesome.  Next time I will make additions for my taste but done this way it is perfectly delicious.  As for my additions next time, I will add Penzey's Minced Red Pepper, not a Greek spice seasoning, a bit of parsley and a smidgeon of Penzey's Greek Seasoning (No, this is not an ad for Penzey's I just love their spices).  Also I will add garlic and I did leave our the salt, as suggested by the writer of the recipe.  I also prefer milk to water but to rate a recipe I believe it is important to follow it, and found the water was fine for this.

This was very nice - quick, easy and very tasty. I made it exactly as written, though given the saltiness of the feta, the "salt ... to taste" seems unnecessary to me. I usually add Tabasco sauce to scrambled eggs, but this dish didn't need it. I do kind of think that there's too much feta here. I enjoyed this, and will probably make it again sometime, but with maybe only half as much feta. Still, I recommend this recipe.

Awesome! Just the right saltiness from the feta. I added some oregano but you could add anything to these eggs and it would work.

I loved this, just had for Sunday brunch - I included chopped spring onions and a tiny bit of chili. I really like my scrambled eggs fluffy so I cooked on a very low heat to begin and then once the heat turned up stirred until ready

The feta cheese was too salty in my opinion. I actually regular scrambled eggs over this. I think this dish deserves two stars because I ate it, but I didn't enjoy it.

Simple and delicious!  I love Feta and it added a nice touch to ordinary scrambled eggs!  I did replace the water with milk instead because that's how I like to make my eggs.  Thanks!

Quick, basic eggs with a nice twist.  I used egg beaters so I did add a bit more salt and pepper--the stuff isn't that flavorful.  I also added a bit of parsley for color.  Bf and I both liked them.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used goat cheese in place of feta.  I added a dash of oregano and chives at the very end.  It was great!

Very good, we love feta (the eggs were ok as well).  Not only does it taste good, but feta is a healthy cheese; lower calories,  higher protein.  Good and good for you.

I found this recipe to be too bland. Perhaps it was the brand /type of feta that I used? I notice that most of the people who gave it 5 stars added onion, tomato and spinach leaves and I think it would be much better with these included. As I made it as per the recipe both my partner and I found it boring and so I ended up putting some sweet chilli sauce on top, which gave it some oomph. I believe that it is an excellent recipe base but more is needed to take it up a level. I will keep it and try again with the extra ingredients and a different feta.

This recipe was simply amazing, I used American cheese. I love the way the eggs and cheese mixed together and it was heavenly with a side of Bacon and OJ

The basic recipe is great. I made this for mother's day breakfast and it was a big hit. I added a little garlic, some basil, and some chopped-up ham (my family likes meat), and the feta still shone through as the primary taste. No salt was necessary. Great taste and easy. Thanks!

Personally I don't like eggs but I loved this!!! I only made a few changes. 
I used olive oil instead of butter and I added half of a shallot before cooking the eggs. It was amazing.

I did not change much except I used 2 extra large eggs as opposed to three large or smaller. I do intend to make this again, also. It turned out very well! Didn’t take very long at all either.  Was very tasty, 5/5 stars!

Followed your recipe, but added 6 more eggs, and lots of sliced & diced vegetables (baby spinach, cherry tomatoes, red & green bell peppers, mushrooms, black olives, and red onion).  This dish really added something special to our Mother's Day brunch : )
