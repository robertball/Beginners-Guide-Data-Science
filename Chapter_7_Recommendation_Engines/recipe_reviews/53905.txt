the filling is very tasty; you need to find a way for the watery tomatoes to not dilute the intensity of the filling

The yogurt ruined it for me.  I was very disappointed because normally I love these ingredients together but this was just a waste of them.

This recipe has real potential.  I thought it had too much yogurt and not quite enough zing.  I am trying to figure out what flavor I would add to it to make it taste better.  But I only used black olives..so maybe the greek olives would make it better.

This was ok but not like I expected.  My husband was not crazy about it he ate the insides but not the tomato.  I saved the left over "stuffing" mixture and served in a warm pita for lunch the next day.  Lunch was a hit!!!

This was so bad that my husband would not even touch them. I tried a little bit of one and thought it was horrible. If you really really like feta cheese and greek olives go for it. Otherwise stay away.

This was easy to make after all the preparation was done. I would make it again. It tasted great.

Made this as a side to the roasted greek chicken and it was great. Only thing I would change is use a little less feta cheese (maybe 1 1/2 cups instead of 2), and less olives or and chop them smaller so they aren't over powering in the bites they come out in. Also make sure to drain the liquid that has accumulated in the tomatoes after cooking before stuffing.

These are really good! The tomatoes are packed full of flavor! The only suggestion I'd make is to cut back on the feta and olives (be sure to use Greek Kalamata olives and not the bland black canned olives). I used half the amount of each and found that to be perfect. The amounts of everything else is just right.  If you cook the tomatoes too long, they will collapse, so keep that in mind and adjust the time accordingly. 10 mins total seems about right for my tastes. Another thing worth mentioning, you could probably skip a step and just drizzle with oil from the start. After the tomatoes are done baking, I remove excess liquid from the tomatoes, then stuff them. I then let them sit for at least 5 mins for the filling to warm slightly. YUM!!!  I've made this twice - one using large tomatoes, and the second time using small Campari tomatoes (which make the perfect appetizer!). Any excess filling would be excellent in a pita. Thank you Michael!

I searched 'tomatoes' and 'feta', and this is what popped up on my screen. I cut the amounts down for one, subbed zucchini for cucumber and dried basil for fresh (cut the amount to just a sprinkle!) and omitted the sugar; I forgot the olives and added some cooked brown rice.  Other reviewers thought the yogurt too much -- like most of what I cook from this site, I used the recipe as a guide and added yogurt to MY taste, so it wasn't too wet and the flavor didn't overpower.  I microwaved the tomato for 1 minute, then stuffed it, then nuked it again as I'm not a fan of raw zucchini and I wanted the cheese melted.  Lovely flavors; the tomato just collapsed, which I liked, tho it wound up on its side by the time I ate it!  One of the fastest suppers I've had using just what I had in the fridge.  Filing this one for future reference!  Thanks for sharing!
