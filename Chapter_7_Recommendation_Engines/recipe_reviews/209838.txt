This was unusual.  It was too spicy for my taste.  If I were to make it again, I would omit the jalapeno. I think I would have like it much better that way.   I used regular cran-cherry juice instead of the sparkling cherry juice and doubled the sugar.

Good, but I had to alter the recipe since I couldn't find frozen tart cherries and sparkling cherry juice. Instead, I did frozen sweet cherries and Sparkling cranberry juice to make up for the tartness. Plus I added extra jalapeno since I was afraid it would be too sweet, not my smartest idea and it was not appreciated by my 4-yr old. I would make it again though....
