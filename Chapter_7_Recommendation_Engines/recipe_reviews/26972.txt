I don't know about anyone else, but this recipe screamed "ADD BACON!" at me. So I did. I cooked and crumbled about 1/2 a pound of bacon and added it along with the spinach and cheese and onion. I cooked the onion first as a personal preference, I don't care for the sharpness of uncooked onion. I think this is amazingly delicious! There was a lot of butter sizzling on the top of the batter and around the edges as it cooked and the top looks a little greasy after it is done, so the butter could probably be reduced. The texture is light, almost quiche-like, but not too eggy. Very hard to describe, it tastes delicious though! Make *SURE* you do not undercook this, if you do it will turn out unappetizingly soggy. Good warm or at room temperature. The recipe doesn't say anything about draining the spinach after it is cooked, but I assumed it should be so I squeezed the cooked spinach till no more liquid ran out (do the same with thawed if you use frozen spinach).

Edit:  I don't know why I ever stinted this recipe that 5th star.  I think I use it more often than any recipe I've found on this site. It would get five stars with the following tweaks: Two bags of spinach, cooked in the microwave & drained. Use half the butter. Saute the onion.  Add garlic and Italian Seasoning. Use mixed Italian cheese and put parmesan on the top. Bacon was a good addition, but not essential. I think this will be great for potlucks and "grab & go" breakfasts. It was hard to stop eating them!  I like the name, because I probably wouldn't have noticed the recipe otherwise, and it's a real keeper!

Great appetizer! I took this to a holiday potluck last week and it was a hit, couldn't find any leftovers!

I did made the following changes to the original recipe, however, based on previous user reviews and whatever cooking sense I may have!

Direction changes: 
a) I sautéed the one chopped onion (about 8.5 oz) along with some fresh minced garlic in butter, until onion was translucent, before adding to the “brownie batter” 
b) I used frozen spinach which I just cooked according to the package directions in the microwave (instead of watching a pot and dirtying another pan to prep spinach)
c) I added in chopped roasted red peppers for a kick, and to add some red to the green since this was for a holiday gathering

Ingredient changes: 
a) Instead of a half cup of butter, I used 2tbsp in which to sauté the onions and chopped garlic, and an additional 2.5 tbsp of butter when making the batter -- the remaining half tbsp of butter greased the pan 
b) added 2 tsp fresh minced garlic as mentioned above 
c) added 1/8 tsp fresh ground black pepper
d) replaced 8 oz mozzarella cheese with 4 oz mozzarella cheese plus 4 oz Mexican cheese blend (Monterey jack, QQ, Asadero blend)
e) Added roasted red peppers (one, 2.5 oz piece) as mentioned above

This is really a 4+/5- but I decided to rate it 5 stars because it required alterations.  

This is very delicious and quick to make.  For those looking to cut back on calories and/or fat - there are simple alterations you can make.  

Reduced the butter to 1/4 cup (used 1 T. to sauté the onion and the remaining 3 T were melted for the 'batter').  

As other reviewers have done - I would strongly suggest sautéing the onion, add a little minced garlic - then wilt the spinach with the onion mixture.  I used 1 1/2 pounds fresh spinach...  

I also used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup all purpose flour... this was a great way to incorporate whole grains in the dish. 

I also suggest adding about 1/2 tsp freshly ground pepper and an extra 1/4 tsp salt (or a generous teasponful).  

I didn't drain the excess liquid from the spinach mixture (the onion and spinach both release liquid, but not a significant amount) - and if you opt to use whole wheat flour - it typically needs a bit more liquid.  

I only had whole milk on hand, but I believe 1 or 2% would work well too (I wouldn't recommend fat-free milk, but you can give it a try).  

Baked for about 35-40 minutes.  Yieled 20 servings (roughly 2x2 inch squares)

Very tasty!!!

WW users: 2 points per seving (based on 20 servings) IF: you use 1/4 cup butter, whole milk, and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour

I've been making this for years & can't believe I'd fogetten to review it.  It's always a hit!  I do make some changes.  I use fresh baby spinach (usually a bag of already washed ready for a salad spinach) chopped in to ribbons, red onion, and feta cheese instead of mozzarrella.  I also add italian herbs, garlic, and typically either chopped red peppers, olives, or both.  I cut the total amount of butter to about 4 tbs, use 2tbs to saute the onion, red pepper, and/or olive & throw the spinach in with the onion until wilted instead of boiling it.  The rest of the butter gets melted & added as directed.  I also  have used even less butter, and it still comes out great.

Loved it! I only had 1/4 c mozza, so added about 1/3c feta, a clove of garlic, and then sprinkled parmasan cheese on top before baking. I also sauted the onion with the spinach. Wow...my 4 year old had 5 of them (he thinks he hates spinach!) Thanks.

Add bacon and basically whatever other combination of cheeses, onion, mushrooms, etc. This recipe is easy to adjust/enchance/change/whatever-you want-to call-it to your preference and to what you have on hand.  DO cut the butter to a little more than 1/2 what is called for, for less oily results.  This was SO tasty and quite the crowd pleaser serving hot and at room temperature.

Delish - I made as written - making half with the mozzarella cheese and the other half with feta cheese.  We liked both versions.  I wanted individual treats so I baked them in my mini muffin pan.  I will definitely bake that way again.
Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Very good flavor-WAY TOO MUCH BUTTER. I added a tablespoon of minced garlic and sauteed the onions.  Next time I think that I'll omit the butter completely-enough oil comes from the cheese.

These were really good.  I found that I will use less oil and butter next time because they were more dense than expected.  They somewhat reminded me of quiche, which is a good thing.  They were gobbled up!

I made a similiar recipe at Christmas this year --the only difference really was that my recipe called for 1/2 pound each of swiss and cheddar cheese instead of the mozzerella...everything else was just about the same.  You can serve them warm, cold or room temperature -- they won't stay around for long, though!

My sister had given me a large overstuffed gallon size bag of spinach (they get it in bulk) and I had forgotten about it in my fridge for about a week. I decided I would rather cook something with it and this recipe kept calling to me, so I decided to try it. I found it rather addicting and I ate 2 slices right out of the oven.   However, I did make a few changes based upon my likes and others reviews. I added a ton of garlic to the onions as I was cooking it. I also added a can of sliced mushrooms and wilted my spinach in the mixture (instead of in a seperate pot). I also salted and peppered my mixture in the pan on top of the salt for the recipe. I also only added 1/3 cup butter instead of half a cup (only because I already had a stick in use). Other than that, it was simple and delicious!

Made these tonight to serve as appetizers tomorrow before dinner.... and I'm going to need handcuffs to stop myself from eating any more.  This recipe is fantastic and I'm a spinach hater!  I used one box of frozen spinach and followed everyone's advice: sauteed the onions, added the squeezed defrosted spinach to that for a while, lessened the butter, added real grated parmesan, garlic powder and pepper.  I also beat the eggs before adding, not sure if that makes a difference.  I will definately be making this again and again!

Really really delicious with the recommended changes from previous reviewers: double the fresh spinach (20 ounces), halve the butter (1/4 cup), a little extra salt (1.25 tspn), add Italian seasoning (1 tspn), add minced garlic (4 cloves).  As suggested by others, I sauteed the onion and garlic, added the chopped spinach to that, then continued with the rest of the recipe's instructions.  I love this.  Really yummy.  I had a giant bag of spinach in the fridge for about 5 days, and we had grown tired of eating spinach salads every day, so I used the leftover pound or so of spinach for this recipe.  Thanks to Bowlingnut for the recipe, and thanks to the reviewers for the added suggestions!!  I look forward to making this again!

Delish! Used 12 oz. fresh mozzarella cheese, 16 oz frozen spinach (not chopped) 1/4 cup butter as suggested by other reviewers. Mixed 1/2 WW Flour and 1/2 AP Flour. Small onion chopped that I nuked in the microwave with the butter.Added granulated garlic and fresh ground pepper. Did I say DELISH? I will use this for an appetizer for 4th of July. Nothing in this will die in the heat and it is savory and wonderful! UPDATE! Made this exactly as written except sub'd in Broccoli - chopped, that I had microwaved. So Good!

I was asked to make these for Thanksgiving; actually a version of this recipe but I was more comfortable with the recipe on AR.  I will tell you that I did read the reviews and made the following adjustments:  I used 4T butter only; using some of it to sautee onion, garlic and mushrooms.  Used one box defrosted/drained chopped spinach.  Otherwise followed the directions and they were a big hit.

2010-11-26  Very good but a little bland.  Some garlic powder & parmesan cheese are definitely in order.  We used 2 packages of defrosted, partially cooked spinach that had been squeezed to remove excess liquid.  The amount of salt was reduced by half as a personal preference.  "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter" was substituted for the real butter without a problem.  We'll definitely make this again with the changes mentioned.

Ive always been curious about this recipe but I was a little apprehensive too.. Spinach & it tastes good? So I made just half a batch. The only changes I made was to substitute water spinach for the spinach, sauté the onions in half the butter then add the spinach and sauté till cooked. Turned off flame and 
allowed to cool slightly then added the rest of the 
butter and stir till melted (just coz I couldn't be 
bothered melting it separately). I also added 1/2 tsp of black pepper powder and 1/2 tsp of red chillie flakes to the flour with the salt. Mixed the mozzarella  into the flour then added the egg milk mixture & then the spinach. I baked this in an 8"by 8" Pyrex dish, cut squares while quite warm (not hot) and served warm.. I really dunno how it tastes served cold as the recipe states because my family devoured it before it could cool down completely. Easy peasy!! & very good too.

I've made these twice. Today I made them for a family reunion. I should have doubled the recipe, because my platter was empty about 5 minutes into the chow line. The one change I make is to grate one large clove of garlic into the batter. Delicious!

I couldn't help but smile at some of the comments. This recipe calls for a 10 oz. bag of FRESH spinach. Once cooked, that reduces down to.....I don't know....about one cup of spinach?? You can't use two boxes of frozen and expect this recipe to turn out the way it's supposed to!! One box would be too much---follow the recipe and use the fresh spinach, and it will taste much, much better!

Not that great the first time, I followed the directions exactly.  The second time I used assorted vegetable like mushrooms, peppers, diced squash, and a onion.  I sautéed them in ½ the amount of butter called for in the original recipe and added seasonings.  They were delicious!

I took the advice of other reviewers and cut the butter to just 2 tsp. I also sauteed the onion as suggested and added garlic to the saute too. Otherwise, I prepared this recipe as written. We very much enjoyed this dish. It's a keeper and I will prepare it again.

This was great! I hate squeezing water out of spinach, so I used 2 tablespoons of the butter to saute the onions (with a minced garlic clove or two) in an electric skillit and added the spinach about as fast as I could cut it up. I just kept stiring and when it was wilted, I was able to put it right in the batter.

This is a great recipe the way it is (except I don't think you need that much butter) but is also great because you can change it up according to what's in the fridge. I added some leftover ham diced up. But I could see adding mushrooms or diced tomatoes. Or maybe feta and some olives. Definitely sautée the onions first to mellow them out. I did the onions first, then just added the fresh spinach to the pan until wilted, instead of boiling the spinach. Easier that way. I also used smoked gouda cheese instead of mozzarella; just a personal preference--I think if you use a stronger cheese you don't need as much of it.

So simple and yummy!! We make this recipe all the time - very very good for breakfast!! The only thing we've added to enhance the flavour is cooked / crumbled bacon. Delicious :)  Use parchment paper when you make these - you will have perfect "brownies" every time!! No clean up and the brownies won't stick to the pan!

This was delicious. I did make a few changes also, so maybe I shouldn't give it 5 stars? I sauteed chopped mushrooms in a pan, drained and set aside. Sauteed onion and added chopped fresh spinach and minced garlic at the last few minutes of cooking.Then I drained any extra liquid. -just to see how that would taste. I only used a 1/4 cup of butter. I used half mozzerella and half parmesan.  After I spread it in the pan I gently mixed a little crumbled bacon in to half the pan and topped the whole thing with a bit more parmesan cheese. It was really really good and I will make this over and over, trying different cheeses and veggies.

I'm on the fence about this recipe but I'm giving it 5 stars because I really don't think there's anything wrong with it.  I don't think the term "brownies" is accurate but that's not worth taking away a star.  I think it is more like a baked omelet.  I had a 9 ounce package of fresh baby spinach that I had only taken a small handful out of so I had a little less spinach than the recipe called for.  I used half whole wheat and half white flour, sauteed the spinach instead of boiling it and I also sauteed the onions and added two cloves of garlic.  I am not a fan of mozzarella except in pizza so I cleaned out what shredded cheese I had which was some sharp cheddar and some shredded asiago.  I have no idea what amount of cheese I had.  I baked the mixture in a square Pyrex pan (probably 9x9) because some reviews complained of the brownies being too thin.  They baked about 35 minutes.  I ate one right of the oven and it was tasty but I'm not sure what all the fuss is about.  I may freeze the rest and take them to the Christmas potluck we'll be going to.

OK, so this is an unfortunate name for a recipe. A 9x13 pan does not a brownie make. I think the name puts people off of the recipe because they are trying to picture how the heck spinach and chocolate go together! That's too bad because it is really good and worth trying. I took the last reviewer's suggestion and included crumbled crisp cooked bacon. To die for! I took it to work and it vanished. People said "what's this?" (somewhat suspiciously) and then had a bite and were saying "YUM!". I think the butter could be reduced slightly, but it's not overly greasy as is. Make sure to squeeze the heck out of the spinach once it is cooked to get rid of all the moisture. I suspect that has been the cause of some of the failures described in the reviews.

These are so delicious!! Based on the reviews, I used only 1/4 cup butter and sauteed onions and finely chopped garlic. Once they were translucent and aromatic I added the fresh ribbon-cut spinach and sauteed until wilted. I used a blend of cheddar and jack cheeses instead of the mozzarella. Will make them again, trying different cheeses and maybe adding mushrooms. Great recipe!!!

I found these very bland and nobody cared for them. I would have to add more spices and maybe some more different cheese, definitely garlic for my taste.

Sorry we just didn't like these at all and that makes me sad because I really wanted to love them. We followed the recipe exactly. The flavor was quite bland and the texture was not at all what I was expecting. The texture was less "brownie" and more "casserole".

I'm a huge fan of this!  I would suggest adding seasoning - salt, garlic, herbs, something - because it can be bland.  Pepperjack cheese is fantastic in this, and adding a can of diced green chiles to the recipe is good too.  The first time I made it I was short on mozzarella, so I made up the difference with canned parmesan, with good results.  Tonight, I made it with jack and sharp cheddar, and whole wheat flour.  I like it plain or topped with salsa, and my kidlet loves it smothered in ketchup.  If you reduce the butter SIGNIFICANTLY and remember to add spices, you really can't go wrong with this perfect to-go breakfast!

I have made these twice now.  The first time I didn't make them thick enough and served them cold.  They were only okay.  The second time, I added extra cheese, made them about and inch thick and took them out after bout 27 minutes (before toothpick ready) and let them sit for a half hour.  I thin whipped up a dipping sauce and served them room temperature.  The whole plate was gone within an hour!  My friends loved them.  Next time I think I am going to add either crushed red pepper or nutmeg.  Like a lot of other people, I only use the butter to saute the onions.

I first tasted the spinach brownies when I visited a bed and breakfast in the Berkshires.  The owner gave me the recipe upon my checking out.  I made it for a potluck breakfast at my childrens's school four years ago and I've had the faculty, children and other parents hooked on my spinach brownies since.  In my version I only use half the amount of butter, and I use a different kind of cheese each time I make it. Asiago or an XXtra sharp cheese in the recipe is great.  I've used one half cup of dried minced onion instead of using the chopped onion.  It's the best.  My kids can eat a whole pan!

These are alright. I think they need to cook significantly longer than the listed time, I cooked them for 35 minutes and wished I had done 45 minutes (or until the top becomes a bit golden).

I only gave this 3 stars because it wasn't totally awful, just not my cup of tea. Spinach sheese and onion sould like a winning combo but this recipe lacked any true flavor. Maybe garlic and some  artichoke could flare it up. try it out and tweak it to your preferance. That is what cooking is all about.

OK - the name is what prompted me to look - I thought how nasty - but I looked, read and made and these are absolutely FANTASTIC.  I alsways looks for 'new' ways to get my kid to eat "yucky" vegetables - although he didn't like them - I did and WILL make again.  However, the name should be changed - LOL

I'm surprised I don't see anyone else pointing out the 2 10oz. boxes of frozen spinach substituted for 10 oz. of fresh equals way too much spinach in the recipe.  I should have reasoned it out for myself but I went ahead with all the spinach which resulted in very flat, mostly spinach, brownies but they did still taste good. I will use 1 box of frozen spinach next time.

Made it as written and it was a hit as a Thanksgiving appetizer. All of the 9x13 pans were in use, so I put them in a mini muffin tin. Made it even easier to eat (adjusted cooking time).

Put your mixture in muffin pans -- it makes them so much easier to serve and mine only baked for 15 minutes (my pans were closer to mini size). I did a half recipe and got about nine out. I used sharp white cheddar cheese and 3tsp of butter in my recipe and thought they were great! I spread dill mustard on top and then proceeded to eat four in a row. :)

I cannot really say if this is any good or not, the 13 X 9 pan is not the pan to use.  It came out too thin and burnt the bottom and basically could not serve it.  I will definitely try again with an 8 X 8 square pan and keep the temp down a bit.

These are pretty good. I think it would take some changes well. I love the texture and it's not soggy/eggy like a lot of egg-bake type dishes end up being. It would be fun to try with asparagus, artichoke hearts, different cheese varieties, etc. Thanks for sharing!

These were delicious. I sauteed the onions plus a few chopped mushrooms and then added 10 ounces of chopped spinach to wilt down, all in 2 tablespoons of butter. Then went with recipe and added the rest of butter melted to the batter. Used part grated mozzarella and a bit of swiss. Stirred it all together and sprinkled a little parmesan on top before baking. Yum!!! We were having meatball sandwiches and these went so well with a bit of spaghetti sauce.

I love the idea of spinach brownies, and thought these would be a huge hit.  I made according to the recipe and no one took more than a few bites.  I made once again thinking i could liven it up with bacon and substitued half of the cheese with an italian blend. Same results. Bland and unremarkable.

I added several things to this recipe because I wanted it to be an easy breakfast for me to eat during the week.  The first thing I did differently was saute the onion in butter and garlic.  I also added cooked mushrooms and turkey sausage crumbles to the "batter".  I used one can of Rotel to top the entire dish.  It turned out really well.

These were good but not great. I followed the recipes exactly, with the exception that I added some bacon bits into the mixture. It still turned out a little bit bland. I wish it would have more flavor to it. Overall, this recipe (in my opinion) needs a tiny bit more PIZAZZ!

This was good, but very greasy.  I agree with the reviewer who advised to reduce the amount of butter--I'll make these again, but with maybe 1/2 the butter to see how it works.  Bacon was yummy in these, and I could imagine other combinations also--spinach, feta, & sundried tomatoes & grated zucchini with an Italian cheese blend.  I'll make these again, but will have to lower the greasiness somehow.

Excellent!
 I added Basil, Oregano, and garlic. Tastes just like a breadstick.

OMGracious!!! These were soooo good!!
The name was kind of freaking me out--but the flavor floored me!!!!!!!!AWESOME!
The only change I'll make next time is to add more salt, like maybe another 1/2 teaspoon. To make it 1.5tsp. of salt.
But besides that they were great!! I will be taking these to brunches, showers, weddings, and all kinds of "Food Oriented" partys, especially "Breakfast".
I think the name should be changed to something like....."Spinach Squares" or "Spinach Cheese Bread" or something that doesn't make you think of chocolate....which i like to think of !!
haha
Thanks for the recipe,

Been making these for years, but forgot to review them.  I always double the recipe because I love them so much!  Because I double it, I use half sharp cheddar and half mozzarella.  I do sautee the onion a bit first.  I use frozen spinach and squeeze it really well before adding.  These are heaven to me!  I love to take them for lunch the next day.

A little salty and they did not cut into nice squares as well as I had hoped...perhaps they were too warm?  Not outstanding....just OK.

Very yummy, but I did make some changes.
First, I sautéed the onion in the butter (actually I used less butter also). Then I added the spinach to the onion, instead of boiling. I did this mostly so I would have less dishes to wash. I also added bacon to the dish. It turned our much like a quiche. It was delicious, but without the bacon it would have been sort-of bland.

These are great. The whole family said I could make these again, anytime. They also hold up well as leftovers, cold or reheated. I confess to accidentally leaving out the butter - after melting it in the microwave, I got distracted and then forgot it was in there. That likely lead to these being not as light and fluffy as they might have been otherwise, but they were delicious nonetheless.

I had some organic baby spinach my mom wasn't going to use, so she gave it to me to figure out what to do with it.  When I saw this recipe, I knew I had to try it.  I did have to make some changes according to the ingredients I had on hand; I substituted 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour for the all-purpose flour since I had more of the ww flour on hand. I also had more cheddar than mozzarella cheese available, so I probably shredded two thirds of cheddar and one third of the mozzarella.  I also thought that this could be made just a little bit better by substituting half of the spinach called for with artichoke hearts since I had a bag of artichoke hearts sitting in my freezer for what seemed like forever.  And spinach and artichoke just naturally go together so well.  So I defrosted a 12 oz. bag of artichoke hearts and finely chopped them and sauteed them in the pan with 2 tbsp of I Can't Believe It's Not Butter (the other 2 tbsp of ICBINB got melted and tossed into the batter) the chopped onion, added two cloves of garlic and s&p, and the 6 cups of fresh spinach that I used got sauteed with the onion/artichoke mix at the end.  Once the mixture was in the pan, I sprinkled some parmesan cheese over the top and baked it.  Yum!  My husband didn't even want to share with the kids, and my 19 month old had two pieces and wanted more.  I think with the changes I made, this turned out to be an awesome recipe, and finally a way I can get my kids to eat veggies.  And that's always good.

Even after I added carmelized onions, pancetta,  sauteed garlic, nutmeg, herbes-de-provence and gruyere -  I still found these really bland and doughy. My kids who LOVE spinach and request quiche on a regular basis ate just two bites.

These are usually quite popular when I make them but I add additional onion and try some additional seasoning.  I find the original recipe to be a bit bland.

Wonderful!!! Made for a birthday party. It was all the rave.  I made some changes as suggested. I cut the butter, but just by 2 tablespoons. I used one small onion, three cloves of garlic and sauted in the butter, then added about 1/2 cup of sliced fresh mushrooms. I took 10 oz of fresh baby spinach, chopped and added to the onions, garlic and spinach and cooked it down a little. I added some Tony's Creole Seasoning and doubled the cheese, using 1/2 mozzarella and 1/2 fiesta mix. Mixed other items and added a little parm to the top. Yummie

Easy and tasty. Don't bother boiling the spinach. Instead, give the onions a quick sauté in some of the butter, and toss the chopped spinach in at the end to wilt it. Then add in to the other ingredients and bake. Mozzarella cheese is kind of bland, so I suggest replacing half of it with feta, Parmesan, or whatever you like.

I made these for Mother's Day, and they were a hit!  I made them last night, let them cool completely, covered them and popped them in the fridge.  My mom, daughter and I all loved them.  So much so that my 15 year old daughter passed by the pizza, wings AND cheesecake and ate only a plateful of these brownies!!!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I did saute the onion to soften it, and I added a bit more cheese, since a little cheese is good, but more is better!  I can see how this recipe will be fun to play around with, but it truly is 5 stars as written.  My boyfriend and my dad were lucky there were a couple left after our girls day!!!  Thanks for the fabulous recipe...it will be a staple in my home :)  P.S.  I took them out of the fridge and let let them come to room temperature...yum!  But then I heated them for a few seconds in the microwave, and they were OMG YUM!!!

I made a bunch of adjustments & wasn't quite sure how it would turn out, but it ended up good.  I made the following substitutions:
Instead of milk, I used almond milk
Instead of eggs, I used egg whites only
Instead of white flour, I used whole wheat flour
Instead of 8 oz cheese, I used about 3 ounces
Instead of 1/2 cup butter, I used 1/4 cup butter

I know, a lot of substitutions, all with the goal to make it healthier. I thought all the subs might knock out the taste, but they ended up really good! Easy lunch to bring to work with a salad or fruit!

I really wanted to like these especially after all of the great reviews but I didn't find it to be anything outstanding. It was almost too moist/wet after it was done cooking and I did drain the spinach after sauteing. I used 1/2 the butter called for. I thought there would be more batter but it was mostly just spinach. Overall I was not that impressed.

these were very good.I made them as written the first time. and then I made a second time only I changed it a bit. I used sharp cheddar  cheese in casserole and then sprinkled parm cheese on top. I used green onion instead of a reg onion. I used 6 tbs butter instead of  8.both times these went like hot cakes and I was asked for the  recipe

Very simple and delicious spinach side dish. I brought these to a potluck and everyone loved them. They are solid enough to cut into pieces, which is nice for serving.

The only change I would make is to the name, since Spinach Brownies is a bit of a turn-off (perhaps Spinach Quiche Bars?). The only change I made was to use non-dairy milk (original almond) because that's all we drink, and they came out great. If you use frozen spinach (which I did), you can just thaw it and squeeze out the moisture before adding it to the mixture; you don't need to cook it first.

This was absolutely amazing!  However I made a mistake or two!  I didn't have an onion, so I used onion powder, and added bacon like a couple of the other reviewers recommended, I really didn't want to add so much butter, I added about 3/4 of a stick, and it was plenty...the error came in adding 3 lg eggs!  OOPS!  However, it was still DELISH!  Just need to try to follow directions next time!  I looked at that recipe 3 times, and saw 3 eggs every time!  OH well...still a HUGE winner!  Will be making again and again!

It was delicious (I could've eaten the whole pan out of the oven!). I did do a few substitutions for the health factor: I used about 1/4 cup of grapeseed oil instead of the 1/2 cup butter; a little less than the whole cup of cheese, and only about a 1/8 teaspoon of salt. And it was still 5 stars---my 1 year old loved it!

This makes lots, and is very good for taking to church suppers or office potlucks. I thought it was a tad too salty, but I tend to eat toward low sodium, so that may just be me.  DH said, "Yeah. Women probably like it." Meaning, "Yeah, (he) didn't care to see it again." LOL
BTW, I used two 10 oz. pkgs. frozen spinach, as stated to be more or less equivalent to the 10 oz. fresh called for in this (?). My "brownies" looked more like the photos supplied by Candice and Sunflower. I may make these again, because they are good; I'll just have to have somewhere to take and share them.

This smelled so yummy while it was baking it was difficult to wait! I like my food with lots of flavor, so I added 1 tsp. of garlic powder and 1 twp. black pepper to the mix. It would probably be just as scrumptious without the extra seasoning, because the onions really contribute to the overall taste. Easy to make, wonderful to eat! Thank you!

I substituted non-fat Greek yogurt for the butter in recipe, and used skim milk instead of whole milk, and reduced fat cheese.  Absolutely delicious! 
Would also be great with feta cheese and kalamata olives.

These were excellent.  I addedfinely chopped mushrooms and sauteed them with the onion before adding to the mix.  My family couldn't get enough!

I might add bacon or some sun dried tomatoes just to vary this up....but this recipe is a new staple and is fantastic just as written.  Thanks for a recipe that get's my vegetable hating husband to eat spinach!

This recipe was so delicious.  I served it as a side dish.  My boyfriend and I loved it.  He said that I should make it again very soon.

I have quite the collection of recipes in my pantry- this is such a keeper. My husband and I absolutley indulged in these tonight! We had steak, carrots and spinach brownies- I may never make Spanakopita again! (Ok that's a lie..) But, when you can make these- why would you want to bother with all the phyllo and wrapping? I added what I would to Spanakopita- garlic, salt, pepper, and some oregano. Also added freshly grated and regular parmesan cheese. Wow. Thanks for sharing!

Delicious, but too much butter made them greasy and not great for finger food.  Next time I will use more spinach and 1/2 the butter

My family doesn't like room temperature food so I served it hot from the oven which didn't allow it to set and hold its shape and made it seem like a strata (gasp! we hate stratas so I started to worry) but once on a plate it cooled a tad so it could be cut without all the cheese falling out.  Texture is far more gooey than a brownie.  I sauteed the onion in 2 tbl spoons butter.  Added minced garlic and then sauteed about 16 oz fresh spinach.  Combined the rest of the ingredients as per the site except only added an additional 2 tbl spn butter and 1/2 tsp italian seasoning.  Will make again but with a mixture of cheeses- Mozzarella by itself didn't really pack the punch I'd like.

WOW!!! I am in love with this recipe! It was so easy to prep and cook. I opted to use the 2 pkg of frozen spinach and added a little parmesan on top. Made it the night before and just warmed up for my Christmas Day Brunch. Not a crumb left!! This is going to be definite repeat for me..

I was expecting a quiche type dish, but surprisingly it wasn't. I substituted almond milk for milk, and vegan mozzarella for cheese. Great breakfast casserole or even as a side at dinner. Next time I will use less butter and more spinach.

This recipe is amazing! I've made it many times already. I omit the butter completely, sautee the onion(i use 1/2 onion) in olive oil with some garlic and add a tiny bit more salt to the mixture, maybe a 1/4 tsp more. I add a tiny bit more cheese too. It comes out fabulous!

This is a great recipe (see other reviews for yummy subs & suggestions.)  My tried-and-true recipe similar to this is more quiche-like: egg beaters, soy sausage, spinach, red bell pepper, some cheese,onion, no flour, no fat besides the cheese. (can add low- or non-fat cottage cheese, drained, for addl protein) Hint: use foil liners in cupcake tins, cool well, and freeze. Though good served warm from the oven they are a boon to the busy: take frozen for a snack or lunch. They thaw easily. The foil cupcake liners make it very easy to remove the very low fat treat. Thanks!

These are great both warm or cold! If you use frozen spinach, only use a 10 oz package and do NOT cook. Unnecessary step. I sauteed 1/2 diced onion and 1/2 diced red pepper in a small amount of olive oil and added a clove of garlic. I only used 2 T butter in the recipe and that was plenty. I used swiss cheese instead of mozzarella and then sprinled with grated parmesan about 10 minutes before it came out of the oven. Also used an 8 x 11 pan to make the squares a little thicker. Wonderful!

fantastic. I used less than half the butter and less cheese aswell. Still delicious. I also added parmasan, mushrooms, sundried tomatoes and a little spaghetti sauce on top.  Oh yeah, and garlic. Yum. We ate it for dinner with a salad. This one's a keeper.

This recipe was pretty bland.  I was confused by the amount of spinach...the submitters comments indicated two 10 ounce packages of frozen spinach, but the directions called for one, I think one would have been sufficient.  However, on top of that, it just didn't have much flavor.  If I make these again, I will add a package of onion soup mix, or Ranch dressing mix to add some punch, otherwise they are just too bland.

The first turnoff was the name of the recipe, how unfortunate!  My first reaction was "Spinach & chocolate?  Eeeeew!  HOW repulsive!"  I almost didn't even look at the recipe.  I'm glad I did, though.  I rate the recipe only 1 star for the name but 4 stars for taste.  Maybe that adds up to 5 stars?

Oh, My! The name scared me, but the taste made me forget all of my fears. I used the two packages of frozen spinach. I squeezed the heck out of it to get every drip of liquid out. The bars set up very nicely as a result. Someone else mentioned something about the onions. I think the next time I'll probably sautee them lightly to bring out the sweetness and cut the "oniony" taste that keeps my kids away from these bars. Thanks!

I have made these twice. The first time, they had a strong flour taste because I ignored an important step(step 3) so please don't do what I did and dump the flour into the spinach and attempt to mix. It doesn't work as the flour does not mix evenly into the spinach mixture. The second time, I did as instructed and mixed the dry ingredients together before adding the spinach and cheese to the dry mixture. It's amazing what happens when you follow directions!!  Although very good, I felt it was a bit too salty and will cut down on the salt next time. This recipe also worked well for me using GF flour. Thanks for the recipe, bowlingnut!

This is a great 4.5 star recipe that I've made at least 4 times.  My family really enjoys it.  The first time I made as instructed but after that, adjusted to our liking.  I use 2 cans of spinach that have been wrung out with a cheese cloth.  I also carmelize the onion for a deeper flavor, add minced garlic and a dash of cayenne.

Delicious! I have tried this before, as is, and it was very good. This time, I think it's excellent! By necessity, I used Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free All Purpose Flour. Yes, I was nervous, but it worked great! I only used 1/4 cup butter, softened, not melted. I added sautéed diced onions, red pepper, mushrooms, zucchini and garlic; these I had cooked the day before in EVOO, pulled out of the frig while preparing the recipe and added when I added the spinach. I also added garlic powder, fresh ground black pepper and red pepper flakes. I cooked about a half pound of bacon and crumbled it in at the end. I sautéed baby spinach (pkg. was only 5 oz. but with other veggies, it was fine)until just wilted, in a tiny bit of the leftover bacon grease. I used about 6 oz. shredded mozzarella/cheddar cheese blend. After 30 minutes, I added thinly sliced provolone and a handful of grated fresh parmesan to the top. Then baked it 8 more minutes. Made a great breakfast! I just hope it's half as good this week to take for lunches. I will definitely make this again to share - or not, lol. Thank you for the recipe, Bowlingnut.

Oh my, these are SO GOOD!  I made one batch yesterday for Hubby to take to his work potluck. Of course, random sampling took place, leading to a second batch! I doubled the spinach and added some garlic powder, as some other reviewers had suggested. I can see these making a great grab-n-go breakfast for my kids too.  They are very tasty, were very easy to make. I used my Oxo large cookie scoop, which perfectly filled a mini muffin tin opening. This recipe with one extra box of spinach made 3-1/2 dozen mini muffins (baked for 20 minutes, cooled in tins for 5 more minutes). Thank you so much Bowlingnut for submitting a really tasty, easy recipe!

I made half a batch of these delicious "brownies" tonight. The only thing I changed, was that I substituted green onions, because I had some that needed to be used up.  These were really good. Even my vegetable hating husband that is not good at trying new things liked these!! Makes a lot. Half recipe made 12 squares, about 2X3 inches each. Hope they warm up well.

I wish I could give this a great review.....it sounded wonderful.   It just turned out pretty mushy, even though I drained the spinach and also left it in the oven 10 minutes extra.

I called them Mini Spinach Bites when I served them because I baked them in a mini-muffin tin. I did alter the recipe slightly: Used 2 tbls butter to sautee 3/4 cup of chopped onion and 1-2 cloves of garlic. I added the thawed spinach to that for a few minutes, and seasoned with salt and pepper. Then followed the directions to mix it all together (with no extra butter). I used an Italian blend of shredded cheese. These bites are delicious!

These were awesome, and so easy to make! I used fresh spinach that I needed to use up today, and sautéed the onions with it. Added some garlic  salt, pepper, and a dash of nutmeg. Amazing! Definitely a keeper, thanks!

HUGE HIT! Loved it, and had all the ingredients (except I used 2 10 oz. frozen, drained and squeezed chopped spinach). STILL getting requests for the recipe. THANK YOU!!!
BTW, my 12 yr old girl gobbled these up, and my 10 yr boy old tolerated them.

This recipe is great exactly as is. I make it all the time! But I do usually use 1/2 cup wheat flour and 1/2 cup white flour instead of all white.

These are AMAZING! I would eat these all day and night! I added another 10 oz. package of spinach & it was amazing. I love the flavors! I might cut back on butter a bit next time, mess around with it and try to create it healthier but for the most part - Mmm!

Wonderful!! I followed the recipe almost exactly except I used half the onion, added fresh chopped garlic and mushroom. Next time I may try adding a few pieces of bacon for extra flavor! And I think I may use about half of the butter that the recipe calls for.

This was very good and family loved it!  I did double the fresh spinach and threw in some fresh mushrooms and garlic.  Sauteed onion, garlic and mushroom, then added spinach to wilt.  It was a bit bland.  Next time, will add some feta cheese, nutmeg and a few more spices to kick up the flavor.  Recommend!

I love this recipe!!! I made it with some fresh and frozen spinach because I wasn't sure I had enough. Talk about comfort food. I used about 1/3 cup of cheese and it was enough for me., but just as it is, it's perfect.
Thank you for a new staple recipe in my home!

This is a terrific base recipe. I used a frozen pack of spinach that I cooked and squeezed out. Added some roasted red peppers and feta cheese. Also added some pepper flakes and garlic powder. Only used 3 tbsp of butter and glad I did because it would have been way too greasy otherwise. Melted butter and then added minced onion to that. Next time, I will add artichokes. The only thing that surprised me was how thin they came out. Don't know if this was a function of how I cooked them or not. Still delicious! *Update - used fresh spinach cooked with garlic and lots of it. No peppers - not too thin, came out great.

We ate this for our veggie on the 4th of July, and my wife went absolutely ape over it.  We used 10-12 ounces of spinach, and next time we might just use 15-18 ounces of fresh spinach... it tasted great, but a little more spinach wouldn't hurt.  We will make this again and again, I'm sure.

Yum! My changes as suggested were reducing the butter to 1/4 cup and  instead of step 2, I sauteed a package of frozen spinach (thawed and drained) with onions and a bit of minced garlic. Thanks so much!

With a few simple changes made based on other reviews, these were killer! Brown 2 strips of bacon in a skillet. Then, brown the onion and 2 cloves of garlic in the bacon grease. Up the eggs to 3 and only use 2 Tbsp. Melted butter total. In the mix, use 4 oz. Mozzarella cheese and 4 oz. Feta cheese. Top with 4 oz. Parmesan cheese. Voilà! Everyone asked for the recipe! Thanks!

Super quick to make and really tasty. However, DEFINITELY, at the least, cut the butter amount by half!! The 1/2 c. called for is WAY too much. I used a 16oz. pkg frozen spinach, thawed in micro, and moisture squeezed out. I used 3 eggs cuz the ones I had were little, and used a cheddar, monterey jack, mozzarella cheese blend. This recipe is a keeper.

A keeper, but needs a few adjustments.  I can't imagine why you wouldn't cook the onion first, and I was using fresh spinach, so I fried 2 strips of bacon then sauteed the onion & some chopped garlic in the pan drippings.  I added the spinach to cook it all the way down, crumbled the bacon & added it to the spinach mixture.  I only used 1/2 the butter called for (& mine was borderline greasy -- I know I added bacon grease, but I can't imagine the outcome w/ a full stick of butter & you simply don't need it, anyway).  Skim milk worked great & so did Mexican blend cheese, which was what I had on hand.  Made them in a muffin pan, so everyone gets nice, crispy edges (might lower the temp to 350 & let them cook longer next time).  I think this recipe has a lot of potential for all sorts of add-ins.  I'm looking forward to making it again!

Taste was bland and seemed too greasy.  I got a lot of odd looks when I said they were Spinach "Brownies."  I might try this again and spice it up.  Will definitely call it by some other name.

Read through quite a few reviews and decided to sautee onion and one clove garlic first in butter/oil, and doubled the spinach.  I also used fresh mozzarella as opposed to the preshredded bagged stuff (just a personal preference)...can you say perfection??? these are great!

these were pretty tasty, but did make a few changes.  used fresh, not frozen, spinach. added more salt, pepper, ground cayenne, and minced garlic.  skipped the butter and used a tablespoon of olive oil to cut down on amount of fat.  used sharp cheddar instead of mozzarella. very satisfying for breakfast or lunch and a good recipe to play around with!

It is a very tasty recipe. I however made quite a few changes and it is 5* only after the modifications. I used less butter.. only about 1/4 cup and that was sufficient. I melted the butter, poured it into the flour mixture, reserving a little in the pan and I sauted 2 cloves of minced garlic and the onion in it till the onion turned translucent. I also added about a tsp of pepper, more salt, a large pinch of chili flakes and a pinch of oregano. It tasted wonderful after getting spiced up. It makes good starters and will probably make for the Christmas eve informal party we are having.

I made this last night.  Not such a good turnout.  It was quite bland.  I used sharp cheddar thinking that would add a bite.  I want to try this again and may experiment with different spices to adda little more zing.  I love spinach so I am going to give it another go.

I had to try this recipe just based on the name alone and I am glad I did.  Everyone loved it. I always make a recipe as is first but will adjust this one in the future with different cheeses and add ins like bacon for sure.  Very good and super easy!

Made for a gathering and there was none left.  A good dish for a pot luck because it can be served room temp.  The only change I made was only using half of the butter in recipe.

it was not bad, but not exactly thrilling: a crustless spinach quiche. The mozzarella alone is a bit bland, so I suggest to have 3/4 mozzarella and !/ provolone or some such cheese, more savoury; I also would recommend just a bit of parmesan cheese sprinkled on top.

Really good!  They tase like spinach dip in a bar.  They're great with a little crisp crumbled bacon or chopped artichoke hearts mixed in.  I like it topped off with lots parmesan cheese before baking.  My husband and daughter loved them!

Interesting idea - I'd definately change the name to spinach & cheese bars. Brownies make it sound even worse, really. We made it exactly as written and just didn't like it very much. Maybe it was too moist? 9 people here gave it a thumbs down. :(

I took everyone's advice and jazzed it up a bit. I added in some cooked bacon chopped up, a small tomato diced and I only had a bit of mozz.ch, so I added in some chopped up swiss. I sauteed the onion w/ some garlic. Also added in fresh herbs of parsley & thyme, only because I have a ton of it fr my garden. I really think you can add in whatever and it would still be good. I'm giving it to my company later today and that will be the real test. Ps. I only used a little butter, 1/2 stick is way too much, when you are watching what you eat.

Very nice spinach recipe! I thought it would be too dry with the egg/milk/flour ratio but it was perfectly moist and dense. However, the recipe as is can definitely do with more flavour. Sauteing the onion with some garlic, for instance, would be a great addition! On the other hand, no need to use 1/2 cup of butter: 1 tbsp is more than enough!

I made these twice in two days.  Yes - they went that fast.  I added mushrooms the second day and it was great also.  I agree that it would be great with bacon.  Endless possibilities.  The first batch I added some sharp cheddar and I think I will continue to do that because it really gave it a stronger flavor.  This will be one of my 'go-to' party recipes!  Thanks!

It tastes like spinach-cheese pie plus it is super-easy to prepare. I used shredded feta cheese and I sauted the onions like others recommended. It was a delicious treat for my cocktail party.

Cut the fat and smile. Used 1% Milk, Fat Free Mozzarella, 1/2 cup egg substitute, and Benecol Spread (in place of butter). This was such a big hit and no one know it was low fat. 8+) Will use this a lot.

I don't know what is wrong with my family, but everytime I make savory food into squares, they don't seem to like it! I personally loved it and my kids too. My parents and siblings, not so much. That is the only reason I put only 4 stars. I  cooked the onions until transluscent in a bit of olive iol, then added the spinach until nicely wilted. That is the only change I did b4 adding it to the batter. I loved it!

This is GREAT! It's like a quiche without the work! Changes I made were to sautee the onion, and when it was nearly done, throw in the spinach to sautee it rather than boil it. (I used fresh spinach.) I used 1/2 feta and 1/2 cheddar cheese, used whole wheat flour, and I reduced the butter by half. Really great recipe, and I'll use over and over I'm sure! Great find!

Just OK. I would make it again but with some adjustments. My family preferred them warm. Also, I would use a sharper cheese than Mozzarella. Maybe Jack? Also, my husband felt they lacked much flavor; we would definately spice them up I bit (I did add garlic as someone else suggested). Overall, they're a nice idea but need some work for us.

I made a few variations (added diced roasted red pepper, 1 tsp. minced garlic sauteed with the onion, and about 10 shakes of Tabasco) and took the advice from those who felt there was too much butter.  I used the 10 oz. bag of fresh spinach and emptied it into a colander.  After it cooled a bit, I used a side towel to press on it to get as much of the water out as possible.  That allowed me to turn the spinach out onto a cutting board and do criss-cross cuts to chop it.  The topper was about 3 Tbsp. grated parmesan cheese and I served them warm with tomato (pasta) sauce for dipping.  I was asked for the recipe and will definitely make this again. Thank you!

This is a delicious recipe!  It tastes very much like a crustless quiche.  I made it exactly as written, except that I cooked the spinach in the microwave (it retains more nutrients when not boiled in water).  I would make two key changes next time.  1) Reduce the salt (was a bit too salty, plus it's already well-flavored with the cheese and the onion).  2) Cut the butter in half (was very buttery--tasted good, but didn't need to be quite so rich).  I also sprinkled the top with a little paprika and black pepper before baking--it was yummy!

This recipe is great!  I used 1/4 cup of butter (instead of 1/2 cup) and no-fat mozzarella, which reduced the calories by about 30%.  I also threw in a couple cloves of garlic, which worked well.

This recipe was very tasty! Instead of using fresh spinach, I used 2 10 oz boxes of frozen spinach (drained). I also added 3 lg garlic cloves to the recipe. It was a hit!!

Easy to make but very impressive. Made them the day before and they were still great. Make sure not to use too much water when cooking the spinach. I've since made this many times with frozen spinach, just wring it out and half the butter. It's great and can even be frozen!

I agree with most...the name, no, but the taste-YES!  I'd liken the flavor of these bars  to the flavor of spinach and cheese sauce but without the wilty-slimy texture.  Very tasty!  I also sauteed the onions, and added a little garlic powder.  I used reduced-fat sharp cheddar.  My kids (7 & 4) enjoyed them with a little bit of margarine on top.  Hey...anything to get them to eat their dark green veggies!

What a nice appetizer or accompaniment! But don't call the brownies as it turns people off. I said they were Spinach Squares (not creative but not unappealing.) Didn't have mozzarella so I used jalapeno jack cheese. Also added crumbled bacon as suggested by another reviewer. Will keep this in my permanent files.

Very high fat recipe, so I lowered the fat by changing to 1/2 cup olive oil and used part-skim mozarella.  Also used whole wheat flour.  With changes it is only a marginal product.

Took to a card party and they were a hit.  I doubled up the spinach like many suggested and went with the Italian cheese blend.  Next time I will use an extra egg and add some peppers or something with a bit of kick.  Will definitely come back to this one.

Really GOOD!!! I followed the recipe, then made changes the next time.  I gave it a Greek flair by Reducing the Mozzarella to 4 OZ. and replacing it with FETA cheese and 1/2 tea. Dill Weed. It was reminiscent of the flavors of Spanikopita, but much less work. Make sure you really squeeze out the liquid from the spinach after cooking it.  I also followed another reviewers recommendation of sauteing the onions first. I thought is was equally delicious cold the next day.

Add Bacon! This is always a hit when I make it for parties. I cut it into triangles for presentation. I agree with others, add bacon...about 1/2 pound cooked and crumbled. Also, saute the onions with a little garlic and add to spinach. And, I add a little nutmeg...1/2 teaspoon. REALLY good recipe!

I adore this recipe!  It is so delicious.  I have made it with Gluten Free flour and I have used summer squash instead of spinach.  If I take it to work it is good to sit all day and my co-workers come back all day to have another piece.

Thanks for sharing BOWLINGNUT!

I took everyone's suggestion and reduced the amount of butter.  I thought it tasted too much like a quiche. I was hoping for something like spinach held together by cheese. I think if I reduced the amount of flour and added more spinach and cheese it would be more to my taste.

I knew these were going to be good before I made them.  The only thing i changed was i sauteed the onion in a little butter them wilted the spinach with the onion in the pan instead of boiling it.  I will definitely be making these again!

Add sauteed red bell peppers, cut the butter down to 2 Tablespoons, cut the onion in half, and you have a perfect red and green Christmas appetizer.

This was great! It was moist and set dense like a brownie does. It's very similar to a quiche, and can be cut up in small squares for a nice appetizer. Will be adding to my regular recipe repertoire.

This is good and  I enjoyed it. I made some changes for dietary reasons. I used gluten-free flour, lactose free milk Earth balance in place of butter, gluten-free baking powder and mozzarella goat cheese.I had fresh ready to use spinach so I sautéd that  and the onion in 1/2 tablespoon of the earth balance.   Reading the reviews I agree that that the ratio of butter is to much as the spinach and cheese give off liquid.  The only Earth Balance i used was the 1/2 tablespoon to sauté the onion and spinach.I baked it in a round cake pan  and it took 35 minutes and baked up very nice. It is good warm,and  room temp. I would keep it in the fridge if not used right  away cause of the cheese.My mistake because I used goat cheese was forgetting the cheese is salty, so next time I make this I will omit the salt.Thank you for the recipe.

This was AWESOME.  We go to a buffet restaurant that serves this.  I have searched for a long time for a "cheesy spinach casserole" and never found anything that comes close to it.  I have no idea how I stumbled upon this  recipe ..?brownie?...but I just made it and it's exactly what I've been searching for.  I did saute the onions in butter and I added sliced mushrooms that were close to going bad.  I used a 16 ounce bag of frozen spinach so I upped the flour/milk/egg by 1/2 more but I followed all the directions.  It is SOOOO good!  Thank you so much for posting this recipe!  Oh.  I told my sons I was making "spinach brownies" and both said "sounds gross".  It's kind of an odd named recipe.....

I made these to take to work for my colleagues. Rave reviews. Everyone LOVED them (so did I). Like others, I sautéed the onion and garlic in only half the amount of butter called for. I added a few twists of fresh cracked pepper corns, and about 1/8 tsp of nutmeg, which always complements spinach so well. Fantastic treat to bring to work that was savoury rather than sweet!

Not sure what all the fuss is about. I made this for a Superbowl party and it was just OK. I added garlic and used less butter as suggested by others, and cooked it a little longer than recommended, but they were still a little soggy. They taste like mini quiches. People liked them, or maybe they were just being polite; but they weren't flying off the plate and no one was raving, including me. I don't think I'll bother making them again.

These are fabulous and I am not a huge cooked spinach fan! Great taste. The texture is NOT like a quiche it is really like a brownie.  Must be the flour and baking soda that makes it brownie like.  I used 1 box of frozen spinach, thawed and squeezed. 1 tbls butter to saute onion and garlic, threw in the spinach to combine flavors.  3 tbls melted butter. Used itallian seasoning. I only had a half bag of shredded mozzarella on hand, but it seemed enough. I also added a couple of shakes of parmesan. I will be making this regularly!

I have made spinach balls forever and thought I'd try this new twist on a spinach dish.  Sadly disappointed.  Found it to be very bland.  I even browned up the onion with some garlic and put a little bacon and some parmesan cheese on top.  I used 2 frozen spinach instead of fresh, but other reviewers did too and were happy with the results.  Took it to a party and after everyone tasted one, they sat there untouched.   I'll be sticking with my spinach ball recipe.

I followed other reviewers' suggestions and used half the recommended amount of butter, but this still came out with a disgusting wet sponge texture.  Too gross.  I cut it into bars and returned it to the oven to try to dry it out, which helped some, but this recipe would need to be completely re-worked to be good.

Made this for dinner tonight. It was really good, even the picky hubby liked it. I agree with another reviewer who said that the amount of butter stated is too much.  1/2 of one stick is plenty. (I think that may have been what Bowlingnut intended.) 
I altered the recipe by adding 1/2 teaspoon of ground black pepper and by sprinkling the top with fresh grated parmesan cheese before putting into oven.

I followed the recipe. I was just about to declare "bleh" when my 7 year old Official Taster started begging for more "brownies". I didn't think they were anything special but my Big Boy loved them. 

I'm not a proponent of making a good recipe low-fat, but as previous reviewers indicate, butter can definitely be reduced. They're almost too greasy with the full amount. 

Im also wondering if a slightly smaller pan would work better to make them not as thin...

I made this as written except used cheddar and shredded parmesan cheese since that's what I had.   If you used part-skimmed mozzarella the butter amount is probably fine, but since I used hard cheeses, the "brownies" were a little bit greasy on the top.  I really feel that the butter is unnecessary with the addition of cheese, but I will probably try it with half next time. . .and there WILL be a next time!  This tastes like an easy substitute for spanakopita!  This was an awesome addition to our Super Bowl spread!

I served these at room temperature for an open house, and they were the hit of the party. Note, I made them using 1% milk and 2% extra sharp cheddar cheese, and they were FABULOUS! Even my friend who hates vegetables loved them.

I have tried and passed on this recipe. I love it  but this last time I made it I was in a hurry and totally forgot the butter. I made it cooked it and ate it. About an hour or so later went to the microwave to find the butter to my surprise. I never would have known it wasn't in the brownies. So my suggestion Get rid of the extra fat of the butter Completley. I know I will from now on

Wonderful recipe once you add the garlic, itailian seasoning and feta. As many recommend the butter should be cut down to 2-4 tsp and that is what you saute the onions and garlic and spinach with. Great idea to put into mini muffin tins to use as an

I made this with the ingredients listed however I did not cook the spinach. I let the frozen spinach thaw in the fridge overnight and squeezed a lot of the moisture out. I put it in the recipe just like that. It turned out just great. I may experiment with the ingredients next time but this is also great as is.

This recipe was a huge hit with my family! I made a few changes, I sauteed the onion and two cloves of garlic before doing anything else, I mixed everything together(i only added about a tablespoon of butter). then took two 5 x 7 baking dishes and filled one with the mixture, then took about 5 pieces of bacon crumbled and added it to the rest of the batter, and filled the second baking dish. (im a vegetarian in a world of omnivores lol. Needless to say the one with bacon lasted about 10 minutes after i cut it. These really are an amazing idea! let alone an awesome recipe! Thank you so much for taking the time to add this to this site!!!

Second time I have made this. This time I used the 1/2 cup of butter and it is sinful and delicious. I did not cook the onions and I think it made it moister this time. Only variation was 1 teaspoon of granulated garlic and a sprinkle of freshly grated Parmesan on top. Mozzarella was Italian blend.  Did bake it for 50 minutes. I used my stoneware 9x13. 
First time I made this I used what I had in the house which was feta, added dill, and made it more like crust less spanakopita.
I have also added 4 teaspoons of curry powder when I have mozzarella to give it more flavor. I have made this dozens of times and is missed when I don't bring it to potluck! But I always use the whole stick of butter.....

Delicious.  The only thing I did differently was to cook the onion (plus 1tsp minced garlic) until soft in the butter, then added the fresh chopped spinach to the pan.  I reduced the butter by 1/3. I sprinkled Parmesan cheese over the mixture just before putting the pan in the oven, just to dress up the top a bit.
15 people enjoyed these "brownies". Thanks for the recipe, Bowlingnut.

I changed this pretty majorly but kept the base. Rated with changes. Sauteed a little onion and garlic in half the butter. Added 20 oz fresh spinach. Added 1 tsp italian seasons and pepper to taste. added 1/2 cup sun dried tomatoes (in oil). Replaced the mozzarella with feta and baked 34 min in a 9x13 pan. They were great.

Used only half the butter and sautéed garlic in this while I melted it.  Didn't have spinach, but I used brussel sprouts and chopped them up.  Incredibly awesome!

Just tried this recipe tonight and it was very tasty! I made the recipe as written with a few additions. I added half of a diced onion and some minced garlic (which I sauteed with some butter), and also used some Parmesan cheese in the mixture. I used only a half stick of butter (it's still pretty greasy even at that since the cheese has oils), and wished I had used slightly less salt as the cheese and butter were salted as well. Overall, it was really good! Next time I will try adding some drained and chopped artichokes and maybe even some pimentos for color. One other thing... I accidentally bought baking soda instead of baking powder! I looked up some way to substitute it, so I only added 1/4th tsp of baking soda plus 1/2 tsp of lemon juice (per advice on internet). It came out just fine!

It did need some acid.  And definitely more salt.  A little nutmeg wouldn't hurt, I don't think.  It pairs well with dairy and spinach.  Thank you for the recipe.

Yum! I did make some changes.  1) First I sauteed the onion and some garlic in olive oil.  2) Then added 10 oz fresh spinach until it wilted. 3) Did not use butter.

The name catches everyone's attention and the taste keeps them coming back until the plate is empty! I used a bag of fresh spinach, cut into narrow ribbons, which I added to the onions and garlic sauteed in butter. With lots of leeway to experiment, this recipe is going into my permanent repertoire. Thanks BowlingNut and reviewers!

I made this today as written and thought it was weird all around. it was really fluffy and bland. I prefer baked eggs. I hardly ever rate something low because I will eat anything, haha. maybe an extra egg or two would make it have a better mouth feel.

These were ok, they didn't look very appetizing at all. I'm glad I cut the recipe in half to try before using a whole bag of spinach.

Added thinly sliced fresh mushrooms. Pan fried the onions, mushrooms in a little of the melted butter. Rather than mess yet another pan/pot, tossed the chopped spinach in with the onion / mushroom mix until wilted. Then made as per the recipe. Loved it!

Very good, reminds me a bit of quiche but less eggy. I took other reviewers advice and doubled the spinach and added garlic and parmesan. I can't imagine these without doubling the spinach though (it cooks down so much). Tasty "brownies" none the less, thanks for the recipe:)

This was not a hit in our house.  I followed the recipe exactly and my husband and son thought they were terrible. I thought they were marginally better but found them to be greasy and bland.  I would try it again with half the butter called for and I would saute the onion with some garlic for more flavor before adding to the mixture.

Very good!!  I took the advice of others and doubled the spinach and added turkey bacon and I can't imagine NOT doing it that way!  I also sauteed the onions first.  This had non-spinach-eaters raving at Thanksgiving dinner!

I'm sorry to report that this recipe was not a success.  I did make a few slight changes that I would have thought would have given it extra flavor, but it ended up being bland and flat.  I added bacon like other members suggested, used 3/4 stick of butter instead of a whole stick, and olive oil instead of butter when sauteeing the onions.  It may just be that I was expecting something different and it wasn't what I was looking for.  Sadly, I probably won't make it again.

I have been making this recipe for a while now and each time I'm in awe of how yummy it is. Granted, I did tweak it a bit but the original recipe is still the basis. One time I wanted to make this dish but I didn’t have enough spinach. I then wanted to make a broccoli recipe but I didn’t have enough broccoli either so I decided to mix both and I just substituted the missing spinach with the broccoli that I had (if you have enough spinach use as much as the original recipe specifies because the broccoli is just a little extra that doesn’t influence anything). The resulting dish turned out so good that I have been making it like that ever since. I boil the broccoli and place it in the baking dish after which I pour the spinach mixture over it. Since I’m crazy for garlic and oregano I add some of that to the spinach mixture as well. I usually leave out the mozzarella and use whole wheat flour to make it healthier but it’s amazing either way. I bake it just like the original recipe says 30-35 minutes. A HUGE  thank you for sharing this amazing recipe, I will be forever grateful for it.

Yummy!  I have made these two times and they have been slightly different each time but delicious either way.  My kids, ages 6, 2.5, and 1.5 all ate them and that's always a good thing for me.  I think there are a lot of different ingredients that could be added but they are perfect the way the recipe is written.
**I make these at least twice a month now and am still experimenting.  I like to saute the onions in 1/4 cup of butter and then wilt the fresh spinach in the same pan.  I then add it all to the other ingredients and bake. For me this technique brings the results that my family likes the most.

I decided to cut down on the butter by half (1/4 cup) as suggested by many, and I sauteed the onion on a bit of olive oil and added the spinach to the onions once they were traslucent. I cooked them in the skillet until they wilted and proceeded with the recipe. Because I only had 4 oz of mozarella in the house, I completed the cheese amount with some shredded gouda but I think feta would work well or any other cheese combination for that matter. We enjoyed the taste but a tad more salt (or a saltier cheese) and some more spinach would have made it even better.

These turned out really good. I followed the advice of other reviewers and used to bags of spinach, saute the onions, added garlic and crushed red peppers. I also only used 2tbsp of butter. Great easy side dish. Will be making again.
Another version:
I realized I didn't have enough spinach and I had other veggies to use up so I saute diced up zucchini, squash, red bell pepper onion, and garlic. Used fat free cheddar cheese. Than follow everything else exact and same measurements (expect spinach.. only had a 6oz bag) and it turned out good. My husband like this better because it was so spinach. I like the original recipe better but this is a good way to use up some fresh summer veggies.

This recipe is super yum! I altered it a bit...instead of white flour I used 1/2 Cup brown rice flour and 1/2 Cup whole wheat flour. I used an 8oz bag of fresh spinach. Also, I added 2 TBS real bacon bits, 1/2 C. diced onions 1/4 C. shredded carrots and 2 TBS chopped sun dried tomatoes (I sauteed all of this in pan together in olive oil before adding to recipe). Used Sea Salt. I also substituted 1/2 C of sharp cheddar and 1/2 C Parmesan. OK So I pretty much rewrote the entire recipe anyway it turned out magnificent. Oh by the way I used a 7X11ish pan and it only took 25-30mins to cook but I accidentally set my oven to 400'. They did come out pretty thin so I think they would be tiny if you used larger pan. If you want thick Brownie double the recipe.

These are great and I have made them several times already.  I mainly make them for my 1 year old daughter, but my husband and I like them too.  To make them a bit more healthy for her I cut the butter waaaaay back, use whole wheat flour and add some shredded carrots to the spinach mix.  They also freeze great, yum!!

An easy and tasty way to serve spinach.  This recipe can be 5 stars with modifications.  As others suggested, I sauteed the onion plus some fresh minced garlic in just 1 T. butter and then added the spinach to wilt it.  Finally, I stirred in 1 T. fresh chopped oregano.  In the batter, I only used 2.5 T melted butter.  Using only 3.5 T. butter total in this recipe is plenty, and I would reduce the salt next time also.  I kept thinking that fresh chopped tomatoes would be a good addition as well...probably because the recipe was a little salty as written.  Be sure to bake this until it has browned spots across the entire top, not just around the edges.  The texture leans to the mushy side, and I needed to bake this 40 min.

Just tried it warm out of the oven and I could eat the whole thing.  I used frozen spinach which I sauteed with shallots and garlic, and used a mozzarella/cheddar blend of cheese.  YUMMY!!

Insead of shredded mozarella, I used 16 oz. of 1/2 inch cubed monterey jack.  The big chunks of cheese is what really makes this appetizer the bomb for me!!!  Thanks for sharing!

great easy bars, very kid friendly as well my 2 year old eats them up. definitely throw the spinach in while you sautee the onions, easier, more flavorful spinach, and less clean up.

Fantastic recipe!  I've made them several times, both with fresh (best) and frozen spinach. I sautee the onions & spinach in part of the butter (i reduce the butter to 1/4 cup) before mixing them into the flour mixture. I always add a touch of nutmeg. Yummy!  I crave these!

I love this recipe- but feel free to experiment with the cheese.  Monterey Jack works well- or can be split with the mozzarella since the mozzarella alone is indeed bland.  Or a peppered jack or provolone is also very good.   Also, as with most cheese, serving at room temperature will enhance the cheese flavor.

These are a huge hit!  I made them for every gathering over the holidays and now folks are asking for them again.  I serve them with Green Tabasco sauce which works really well together!

Yummy!  I sauteed the onions first with a little garlic, then added the spinach for a few minutes.  Also, used low fat mozz cheese and added some asiago.  I was horrified that I had no milk, but substituted half and half, omitted the salt and cut down the butter by a pat or 2.. was delish!!

Made this the first time per the recipe, found it was swimming in butter. Second time I used 1/4 cup of the butter, part of it to saute the onion w/2 tsp minced garlic. Dumped that into the casserole dish, threw the spinich in the hot skillet for a few minutes until wilted and most of the water was evaporated, didn't drain, dumped that into the pan w/the onions. Mixed the batter in a medium bowl, added 3/4 cup real bacon bits, dumped the onion/spinich combo in, mixed then put it back in the casserole dish. Baked per instructions and it came out great, nice way to dress up spinich, thanks!

Not only is the name a great conversation piece, this was a hit! Made it last night with a couple alterations due to previous reviews. Saving the recipe though, and passing it along to friends! I used only 1 ~10 oz box of drained frozen spinach. And I used only 1/4 cup of butter that I use to saute the onion in. Also sprinkled some leftover Mozzarella and Parmesan on top!! YUMM Thanks so much for the Recipe idea!!

OMGoodness, these were so yummy!  I did, as others suggested, use some feta and cheddar in place of 2/3 of the moz cheese, which made the dish a bit richer.  I also used fresh garlic and added jarred artichoke hearts.  Def a keeper :o)

These are very yummy! They are like little 'quiche bites'. I just wish my kids would have liked them...I had high hopes, but sadly they wouldn't give them a chance. Probably because they are green! Oh well, I thought they were delicious :) Oh yeah - I should mention - I seasoned them with a bit of black pepper and also added garlic powder. If I make them again I think I will add diced red pepper - hmm... that would be festive for Christmas day brunch! :)

I used self rising flour. Added some leftover turkey.  A little parm on top and I ate the WHOLE thing in two days.  Can't wait to try it with ham and add some more veggies.

Very good recipe.  I cut the butter down to 1/4 cup, sauteed the onions along with red pepper and mushrooms.  I also added more baby spinach which I sauteed in olive oil and then drained on paper towels.  That eliminated the excess moisture.   I read one reviewer who said she did not put the salt in.  Don't do that since that made it bland (I had to sprinkle garlic salt on top to compensate).  I added pepper and Penzey's Arizona Dreaming spice. I used whole milk.  Baked it for 35 minutes in a glass dish and it was perfect.  After it cooled, I cut it into two-bite pieces for a Halloween party.  It was a hit because we have many vegetarians in our circle of friends and family.  Next time, I'm going to make it with Swiss and Gruyere - I think it will be fabulous.

This tasted like a plan quiche with no flavor.  I even read the reviews and added half a pound of bacon in to give it more taste.  Nothing.

Yum!!! I added in quite a bit more veggies (carrots, zucchini, red onion). I'll be making these again and again and again. I've been looking for a good way to get a veggie snack when I'm on campus all day without a refrigerator, and this is awesome. Thank you!!!

This recipe was wonderful!  My 3 kids scarfed them down, and none of us(including me) like cooked spinach.  I was trying to find a way to get some spinach in our diets.  The only thing I did different was to add some crumbled bacon into the batter.  Otherwise, I left it exactly as written.  It will be made again and again!  Cut into smaller portions this would make an excellent addition to a pitch in.  It's good even when it's cold!  Definitely try this recipe out.

Wow, so yummy!  I made this last night as a side dish with dinner.  My 14 month old LOVED it, as did my husband.  Then, this morning, I decided to try a square cold, and they are just as good!  I think I will be making these for the next get together!    I did follow the suggestions of many reviewers, sauteing the onion in 1T of butter with a couple cloves of minced garlic first, then wilting a pound of fresh spinach in with the onion mix.  I also used whole grain flour to add a little more goodness to it.  I only added another 3T of melted butter to the mix... didn't feel the need for the full amount of butter.

These were okay. Added sausage and mushrooms for more of a 'meal'.  As an appetizer I think they're not awful...just nothing that great.

I made these last night.  Followed the recipe exactly.  They weren't bad.  Just kind of ho-hum.  I think mozzarella cheese is probably too mild for this dish.  It needs something sharper to give it some zing.

Yum. I love spinach, and these were perfect. I did not use ANY butter or cheese, and instead used a bit of olive oil, and rice milk in place of real milk. Sauteed onion and garlic + a few shakes of onion and garlic powder, then once I added cooked frozen spinach, I put in a few shakes of Italian seasoning. Will be making again and again.

Let's just say I had 10 men to feed - and these vanished. The only change I made was to add some cheddar because I only had 4 oz of mozzarella. I also used frozen spinach and just zapped it in the microwave. Really really super delicious!

Very good. I liked the flavor. Needs some crunchy texture on the top next time I will put 1/2 cup of parm cheese and broil to melt and get a crispier top. Other than that it was very good. Great way to do something with that spinach that I always seem to have sitting around

I love veggies and I LOVE brownies... and so naturally, spinach brownies, gotta be good, right?! =) I love trying new recipes so I added this to my recipe box. Easy and tasty! I used frozen chopped spinach (thaw/drain), sauteed the onions in olive oil, used half the butter called for, and added a piece of crumbled/cooked bacon. The bacon added nice saltiness and flavor that salt alone cannot accomplish...a little color too! Using half the butter, I felt it was sufficient...I didn't want to deal with the greasiness many others said they experienced. --Overall, fun, tasty recipe that reminded me of quiche.

A good side dish that was really easy to whip up.  I sauted the spinach with some onions instead of boiling them.

This is a very simple recipe that always comes out great. To serve as appetizers, I either slice into bite-size pieces or use a mini-muffin tray to make individual 'cupcakes.' I've also substituted chopped broccoli for the spinach. Mmmm, mmmm, good!

These were so easy and yummy I have to say I'm impressed. I used frozen spinach, thawed and drained. I also used a blend of grated cheeses since that's what I had and a bit of crumbled feta cheese. Cooked for 35 minutes and oh boy! These were a hit. Thanks so much for the recipe, I'll be making it often.

Vest good recipe and definitely a keeper. I did make a few changes. I left out the butter completely. I used fresh spinach, and wilted them down with onions, garlic, and olive oil. For the flour, I used whole wheat, instead of all purpose. Other than that, I followed the directions exactly and it turned out very good.

These were great...with modifications of course. I added a little Cajun seasoning for flavor, sauteed onion and garlic, added frozen spinach, reduced the butter..and they were great!

I loved this recipe, especially as it meant that I got my husband to eat cooked spinach! He even asked for more! My only complaint is that it was way to greasy. I'll adjust for that next time I make this. Oh, and I used different cheese, but I think this would work with a wide variety of cheeses. Yum!

The combination of ingredients in this are good, but the texture came out slimmy even though it was cooked all the way through.  I love quiche and I love cooked spinach but the result of these brownies were not for us.  Though the recipe (as evidenced by the great reviews) has a lot of potential, I will not be making this again; we are texture people.

Waaay too much salt.  My kid's wouldn't even touch it, even when I added bacon. I was upset that I wasted the ingredients.

OMG. This was delicious. Tasted so similar to a turkish borek w/ spinach. The only part of the recipe I changed was I cut the butter to 1/4 cup and used 1tbsp to saute the onion in before adding to batter. Next time I will add in some feta.  You have to try this, it is SOOO good!!

Wow...you want to see kids chow down on spinach?  Make this for them!  My daughter had a little friend over who insisted she hated spinach.  I convinced her to try one bite.  She ate three full "brownies"!  Yummy.

These are very good!!  I did saute the onion and I used canned spinach (drain the water).  Also used a combo of cheeses and went a little lighter on the butter. They turned out so yummy! I'll definitely make this again.

Wow! I made this for our housewarming party and it was very yummy, I did reduce the amount of butter, by a LOT I just used about 2 tablespoons when I cooked the onions and added some garlic to it. Used eggbeaters in place of the eggs that was the only changes I made and it came out great! I had one piece left by the time everyone left and I think that was because no one wanted to take that 'last piece'

This was a good recipe. I did add an extra egg, 4 oz. of chopped canned mushrooms, a red onion for color and some extra provolone cheese. I did put half of the butter in and it seemed enough. I also greased the pan with olive oil. Delicious! It tasted much better the next day for breakfast too!

I am not sure if just my taste buds were off, or this recipe was just not for me. After reading all the reviews and seeing it got a high rating I decided to make this since I had a bag of fresh spinach I needed to use up. Well, I omitted the onions and lessened the butter... and these were inedible. I am sorry, but these were not for me.

Big hit at my house! Followed other suggestions and used frozen spinach. Sauteed onions and 2-3 cloves minced garlic, then added spinach. Added italian seasoning, black pepper, and red pepper flakes. Cut down the moz cheese by 1/3 and replaced it with fetta. only used about 3-4 T butter altogether. Came out great, but remember to grease your pan!

I fried bacon in a pan until crisp (to crumble), reserved some of the drippings and then sauteed the onions and some garlic in it.  I also added some feta cheese.  I had these things on hand that I wanted to use up and it turned out delicious!

these are really bad....because I almost the entire pan...I couldn't even wait to let them cool. The only change I did was the cheese. I didn't have mozzarella, so I used Young Gouda cheese...a shaper tasting cheese....but I am sure the mozzarella would have had the same effect on me....

We eat spinach at least once a week, and I had an extra bag so I decided to make this recipe because of the amount of positive reviews.  I was very disappointed.  These were too flour-y, too greasy, and way too bland.  Not inedible, but not good.

I used pepper jack cheese instead of mozerrella, which gave this a nice subtle kick.  Also, I used a package of frozen spinach, thawed, and all water squeezed out.  Loved it!!!

These were pretty good.  Half of my family liked them and half said they were just ok.  As the recipe is written the end result was good, but not great.  I did add a little dill weed to it, but it needed a little somethng extra.  Another reviewer stated that they would add some feta cheese next time and I think that would be a good addition.  Overall a good recipe but could be great with something a little extra.

This was good.  I followed others suggestions and sauted the onion in about 1 Tablespoon of olive oil and added about 1 1/4 teaspoon of minced garlic.  I also didn't boil the spinach I just placed it in the skilled after I sauted the onion put a lid on it and let the spinach wilt that way.  I totally omitted the butter.  I also used fat free mozzarella,  I think next time I may use a cup of mozzarella and a cup of cheddar it will probably add to the taste.  This is definitely a good base recipe!

My mom has made these for years.....she calls them spinach squares. We like to use Jack cheese in combination with the mozz to give it a little kick. I agree with other reviewers that the butter can probably be cut way back without sacrificing taste, but I haven't yet tried this modification.

I am addicted to these! I've made them with as much as 20 ounces of fresh spinach and they are still great. I've also used all whole wheat flour -- still good. My favorite modification is adding the cheese on top (last 5 minutes baking) instead of in the "batter." I always decrease the butter to about 1/4 cup (use half of that to sautee the onion). Mmm!

Fantastic! I've served these several times at parties to rave reviews. It's also a way to get my kids to eat spinach. I saute the spinach and onion together, but otherwise follow the recipe as written.

Kind of bland, but OK.  doubt if I would make again, since it just seems to be a quiche but with flour instead of eggs.

This was great! I used 2 packages of frozen - drained. Sauteed 4 small to medium sized onions with 4 cloves of minced garlic and about 10 chopped up small white mushrooms in 1/4 cup of butter until the onions "melted" and the mushrooms browned - let cool before mixing in flour. I had to increase the flour mixture by 1/2 to keep the texture cause of the additional veggies. I also baked in muffin tins for individual portions. Yummmmy!!!

My family wouldn't even think about eating spinach until I made these brownies.  My son who is only one absolutely loves them.  They can be a little salty therefore I omit the added salt from the recipe.  And for fun, I bake them into individual cupcakes using a muffin pan and cupcake liners.  Always fun for the children, and makes for easy serving and cleanup.

This was not to my taste at all.  I thought it was going to be more bread like, but it was pretty eggy.  More like a crepe than anything else I can think of.

I thought these were delicious, although, like some others, I did make some changes.  I added garlic and mushrooms, used tomato basil feta as opposed to mozzarella and cut the butter in half.  I would love to make this one again, and go further by adding some fresh tomatoes into the mix.  Delicious way to eat spinach!!!  Thanks!

This was awesome, awesome, awesome.  YOU DON"T HAVE TO COOK THE SPINACH BEFORE!!!  It still turned out great. I did add flavored garlic herb feta cheese to it.  Next time I will add bacon as well.  A great way to eat your spinach :)

This recipe is amazing.  I made a few changes that I think others may enjoy.  I added a packet of Knorr vegetable soup and used an Italian 4-cheese blend.
Thanks for submitting Trudi.

Delicious and easy. I only used 1/4 c butter per other suggestions and added some garlic. I cooked mine in a 9x9 pan for 35 min and they came out perfect.

I loved this recipe!  Delicious!  I had a bunch of fresh spinach that needed used and this recipe seemed to fit the bill.  It was quick and easy to make and came out wonderfully.  My 6-year old son ate some begrudgingly which was OK with me since he often refuses such things.  I used less butter than called for and used a combo of about 6 oz of feta and mozzarella with some feta sprinkled on top.  I was using up a 4 lb bag of spinach and assume I used closer to 20 oz than 10.  The recipe can certainly stand more than 10oz of spinach.

My family loves anything "spinach". What a nice treat.  I made the recipe while slightly tweaking it with a few choice ingredients and we all enjoyed a delicious outcome. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, we will make it again

Awesome! I now always keep these freshly made for a healthy, quick snack. I use 3/4 cup butter, rather than full cup. Made these for a party and they were a hit!

These were very good, but nothing special.  They reminded me of spinach quiche and would be great for brunch.  I made them exactly as the recipe called and didn't have any trouble having them set up. I drained the spinach very well before adding it to the other ingredients. They make a great finger food.

I cook with less butter becuause it seems to come out a little greasy.  Try adding artichokes for a "spinach and artichoke" dip taste.

I scaled the recipe down to 6 servings and made them in a muffin tin.  Added fresh minced garlic and mushrooms (personal preference.)  We love these at room temp and they were as good the next day.  Thanks for the recipe, will be making these often.

I had alot of fun watching people's faces when I asked them to try a spinach brownie!  They were easy to make even though I used fresh spinach from the garden and had to do alot of chopping.  I had provolone and cheddar jack in the fridge so I used that. I added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg but would add 1 tsp next time.  There will be a next time with these.   They are fun!  The texture is remarkably brownie-like - especially if you think "brownie" while you are eating it.  I agree that crumbled bacon would be a nice addition and I will remember to add the onion next time too!

Excellent recipe! I hate vegetables and I have a lot of trouble eating them. I was looking for a recipe that incorporated vegetables without sacrificing taste and came upon this one. It was delicious!! The instructions were very easy to follow, especially for people with little cooking experience (like me). My sister tried it and she loved it too. I will be using this recipe again. Thanks!

These were delicious! I made the recipe quite haphazardly, but it still came out fabulous! I accidently doubled the baking powder which gave the spinach brownies more of a quiche-like consistency, but the taste was wonderful. I also used eggbeaters instead of eggs and garlic salt as opposed to just the regular.

I think Spinach Sticks would be a more appetizing name than Spinach Brownies.  But they were yummy.  I added garlic and red pepper flakes and dipped them in tomato sauce, like mozzarella sticks.

These were yummy!  Usually I don't change a recipe the first go around but I was short on Mozarella by a cup and so I used half mozarella and half swiss.  Next time I will use all swiss or maybe so parmesan.  Also a small kick of cayenne or hot sauce might be nice.  Overall this is just great! Thanks for the recipe.

I loved this recipe!  It reminded me of a crustless quiche.  The changes I made were that I sauteed the spinach and onions together in half the amount of butter (1/4C) and I substituted feta cheese for the mozarella but then sprinkled some mozarella on the top before baking.  I changed the name to "spinach pie" and served it for dinner.  Even my 4-year-old loved it!  It's even better warmed up the second day.

Sorry but I thought this was bad - it smelt good when cooking, but it looked messy and tasted greasy - although I think less spinach and butter might have saved it.

This was not good.  And not worth the price it costs to make.  I ended up throwing over 3/4 of it away.  Even my dog wouldn't eat it.  Only one person said she liked it, and I think she was just being nice.  Most were afraid to try it.  I'm sorry for being so negative, but I made it correctly...it just wasn't good.

This is a simple, yummy spinach treat. I cut it into small squares and speared with tooth picks for appetizers. This recipe is also very easy to adjust for other veggies. I used the basic plan, but left out the spinach, and instead used a batch of mushrooms cooked with onions and garlic (with parsley, a little white wine, and salt and pepper) and it was GREAT - maybe even better than the spinach. I will use this again!

After reading many many reviews I made these.  Used one box frozen chopped spinach, cooked and drained.  Cooked the onion in 2 TBS butter (no extra butter), added spinach, salt &pepper and garlic powder, whisked the eggs with the milk,  I used bag of shredded Mexican mix cheese (it was what I had in house) I think I will try Feta next time.   Mixed all together.  Came out great, nice spinachy texture and taste.

Made this twice, the 1st time I made the recipe as written. It was good as is, a little too oily and I didn't care for the slightly cooked onion.

2nd time I cut the butter to 1/4 c (2 Tbsp to cook onions, 2 Tbsp for flour mixture). Absolutely delicious with these two simple changes and doesn't stray too much from the original recipe.

Made It in 7x9 dish for Super Bowl "kickoff". It was just right for brownie size portions,  "scored" nicely and could be eaten as finger food. Delicious, and several people asked for recipe. A "winner".

Made it in 9x13 this time for a side with soups. Smells divine.

These were delicious! Like others, I cut the butter in half, and the next time (there will be one!) I will cut back even a bit more. It just isn't necessary, and it adds so much fat. They were easy to make, but it did take me longer to prep than the directions state, probably because I used fresh spinach and had to chop it first.  I had a few leftovers; they kept well in the fridge and were great heated up just a bit in the microwave. Highly recommend this recipe!

Delicious.  Sauted onions with garlic and a teaspon of butter, then added the spinach. Added only a teaspon of butter to the batter, but it didnt need it.  Will definitely make it again.

My mom used to make these and called them spinach squares. I  had forgotten about them.. I sauted the onion with garlic and a four tbls butter and added the spinach to pan. I melted butter to add to mixture but forgot about it.  Daughter found  the butter in the microwave the next day. We ate the whole pan anyhow. Love these.

Very good recipe and flexible to sub with other ingredients! Due to dietary restrictions I subbed with GF AP Flour, DF milk (coconut), and used goat cheese. Since I sauteed the fresh spinach and added salt, I reduced the salt to about over 1/8 tsp/ just under 1/4 tsp. I would omit the salt next time, but this is solely dependent on the ingredients you use. Also, the only butter I used was to saute the spinach. I baked in 8x8 square pan and was glad I did because the mixture in 9x13 would have resulted in very thin "brownies" or squares. Will be making this recipe again and even add a few other vegetables, such as mushrooms to it, or different cheeses. Delish! Thank you for the recipe!

The only change I made was baking these in mini muffin tins.  Makes great little appetizers.  They get a little crunchy, which makes them even better.  Leftovers can be frozen, and just reheated in the oven until heated through.  I think they are even better  when reheated.  Many members of my family don't like spinach, but they LOVE these.  I have made them a million times!!

I've made this several times now.  I added a few baby sweet peppers, and used a combination of American and Swiss cheese, and some vegetable seasoning.   It is a very flexible recipe, much like a crustless quiche.

I made a double recipe for two Christmas Eve parties.  Simple to make and very good.  I made it with both a sweet yellow onion and red onion (sauteed with a half tablespoon of minced garlic and a chopped fire roasted red bell pepper for the double recipe).  I split the cheese with mozzarella and feta, cut the butter in half, then baked is about five minutes longer to make sure it was not under cooked (worked great).  Used two 9x9 nonstick pans and still coated them in with little butter.  Let them cool and cut them into small squares, but had a couple myself.  Very good.

I made this recipe with some minor tweaks suggested in other reviews (less butter, added a small amount of bacon). I found the texture of this dish off-putting. I baked it for 35 minutes and toothpick came out clean, but it did not have a brownie-like texture.

I followed other reviews and sautéed onions and garlic and than added the spinach to wilt. I should have let these ingredients cool off before adding them to the batter. I'm guessing it precooked the eggs and made it a little rubbery. I will make this again and try adding bacon also. That sounds like a great idea. I think a little red pepper would be a good addition as well.

This was delicious! I sautéed the spinach, with the onions, until wilted. Otherwise followed the recipe. Next time I'll use more spinach. I think it could easily handle being doubled (20oz if using fresh).
It has a great flavor. 
Be careful if you use salted butter. I didn't even think about it, and while it didn't turn out too salty, I can see how a more salty butter would put it over the edge.

In case anyone is interested...I experimented with a lower carb version for fun.  I made it with 2/3c almond meal, 1/3c coconut flour (the 'flour substitutes' I had on hand) 1/3c butter, added garlic, and 8oz mexican cheese blend instead of mozz and it turned out delicious too!

This was wonderful!!  I needed a quick appetizer for unexpected guests. This worked great.  I quick thawed box of spinach in microwave..drained and mixed all as directed in recipe.  My only change was that I did not bake in 9x13 pan.  I wanted handheld appetizer.  So I sprayed two 12 cup muffin pans with  non stick spray.  Then filled about 1/3 full.  It filled 21 cups as written.  I baked 22 minutes and they were perfect!  Thanks

Made according to recipe with the exception of reducing the butter to 1/4 cup.  We liked it and I will make again but will sub pepperjack cheese and add some diced jalapenos for a little heat.

I followed this recipe with a few minor changes.  I used 2- 10 oz pkgs frozen spinach,because I do not have the patience for chopping up spinach. Follow box directions for cooking and draining.   I used sharp cheddar cheese (as one reader suggested) for more flavor. I will do this again.  Half way through the baking I liberally sprinkled parmesan cheese on top (from the green can).I found that I had to bake this about 10 minutes longer than suggested.  I served it as one of my appetizers on NYE. I cut it into small squares, finger food size,(brownies) so it was luke warm, and easy for people to handle.  These were a hit. There were only a few squares left over, so in the morning I heated them up and they were like breakfast quiches.  I did not cook the onion first,as some suggested. The onion cooked very nicely as stated in the directions. I do not believe that there was an over abundance of butter, as some suggested.  This is a keeper, and I will make it again.

I thought these were really good and everyone at my party liked them, especially the guys.  I reduced the butter to 4TBS, used 2 TBS to saute 3 minced garlic cloves, onion and fresh spinach and 2TBS in the batter.  I used 1/2 cup of ww flour and 1/2 cup white flour.  I baked it for 30 minutes and it was perfect.  We ate it at room temperature but I wish it was warmer.  I will definitely make these again for an appetizer.  They were super easy to make and a crowd pleaser.

Everybody loved this recipe! The only change I made was to sauté the onions in a small amount of olive oil before adding to the rest of the ingredients. The next time I will try 1/3 cup of butter instead of 1/2 cup.

This is a great app to take to a party.  It's easy and I have a sense you can't really screw it up.  I used half the butter--following the suggestions of others--and added some Italian spices and chopped sun dried tomatoes for more flavor and a holiday look.  Everyone loved it.  Next time I will try Swiss cheese and mushroom bits.  Wouldn't that be good?

This lacked flavor. Definitely needs more seasoning. This would be good as a basis to start with

Entire extended family loved it.  I cut the butter in half as recommended by other reviews and it was great.  Also used half shredded sharp cheddar and half grated parmesan since thats what I had in the house.

Subbed almond flour 1:1, reduced butter by half, sautéed onions in olive oil and added minced garlic, rosemary, and thyme to the pan before mixing into batter. These are amazing and so easy to alter for many diets (unless you're going for low fat). Will make again.

I wish I had read other reviews before making this, because it was too buttery.  I think cutting the butter in half would be just fine.  I also had to use a mixture of Parmesan and cheddar instead of the mozzarella; I think just about any mixture of cheese would do.  I added 1/2 tsp each of Italian seasoning, cayenne pepper, pepper, and chipotle chili powder.  It added a little bit of spice, but not a lot.  Also I used a 1 lb pkg of fresh spinach, which seemed about the right amount in the finished product.

This is the go-to breakfast in our house.  I give it 5 stars because of the "ease to flavor" ratio.  Very satisfying for very little effort. I make it as written but I saute' the spinach just because it's easier.  You could dress it up with bacon or mushrooms but you don't have to.  I whip it up on Sunday night while I make dinner and it is ready to go for Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday mornings.  Cut off a square, throw it in the microwave and in 30 seconds you have a nutritious breakfast for a picky tween and a busy mom.  Voila!!

These are great.  I eat them for breakfast, or grab-n-go.  I have added chopped water chestnuts for crunch, as well as bacon and onion at times.  It comes out like a quiche w/out the crust.

I have made these several times now and my favorite use is as a contribution to a finger food party.  They are not spectacularly interesting and taste like a small cold quiche, but they all disappear from the plate and they are very easy to make.  
To improve the recipe from four stars I make a few changes...  cut down on butter, saute onions and garlic before adding, add sauteed bacon bits, and use a sharper cheese than mozzarella, eg sharp cheddar.  This time I am also going to add italian seasoning as mentioned by another reviewer.

These are terrific!  My vegetarian Thanksgiving included this recipe,and I have made it since for different occasions.  Nice to have a savory appetizer or side dish for brunch or a hearty drinks party.  Easy to eat cut small for finger food or served like a quiche for a brunch or dinner.  The kids loved it as well!

I halved the recipe and put it in a 9x9 pan, uncovered for 30 minutes.  Addictive.  
--don't need as much butter (cut in half or more)
--cook for 35 minutes

Excellent! I will make this many times, easy to adapt with different ingredients. Did my fresh spinach in the microwave and used sauteed onions, personal preference. May try in mini muffin tins next time. Also, no one liked the name of these so we renamed them spinach souflee bites!

Yummy. Who'd have thought it?!!  :)   I used two 10-oz packages of frozen spinach and a little less butter than specified. I might try another type of cheese, or mix mozzarella and feta as someone suggested.  Might try bacon next time also.  All that said, pretty perfect just as written!

Great recipe, very yummy, but, not sure why they would tell you 10 ounces of fresh spinach but two 10 ounce packages of frozen spinach.  Ten ounces is ten ounces.  First time I made it I used fresh, which is all I ever use, and it was more of a bread. The next time I used 20 ounces of spinach and it looked more like the picture and was much yummier! Also, would be helpful to list amount of onion since they are not all the same size. I reduced the butter to 1/4 cup and sautéed  my onions first since they are milder that way.

This recipe is absolutely a 5 STAR - I cut the butter down a wee bit and use a 2 or 3 cheese medley including mozzarella & yellow cheddar - (I also add cooked crumbled bacon when my vegetarian friends aren't around) I brought it to a family reunion and called them "spinach brownies"  the host put them on the dessert table, and no one ate them...LOL...they were full from dinner and were ready for sweets.....no problem though because my son was THRILLED most of them came home.... wonderful warm, cold, or room temp (warm or warmed up is my fav) A+++

LOVE this recipe. And the (picky) relatives do too. It's easy to make but turns out so delicious. It has a great consistency; kind of unique. I did follow others' suggestion to fry the onion up first and I added some garlic. Also did not use so much butter. Highly recommended.

Delicious!  I used a 16 oz. bag a frozen chopped spinach that I heated in a pan to defrost and then cooled.  I also added sautéed portabella mushrooms and as a personal preference, no onions.  Thought it might be too much spinach but it was perfect! As with others, only 1/4 cup of butter...can't imagine it with any more than that.

I just made this and loved it. Though I would cut the amount of salt in half as I felt it was too salty.I wanted to add mushrooms to it but unfortunately didn't have any. Will definitely add them next time

My family and I love this recipe! I made it recently using an Italian blend of cheeses and mozzarella topping. My partner says it reminds her of Spanakopita, which she loves. I'll definitely be using this recipe again.

Very good recipe. I changed it to suit my family's needs. I used 1/4 cup plus 2 tbsp of olive oil instead of butter. I used whole wheat flour instead of white flour and I added 1 tsp of garlic.

As per other reviewers suggestions, I cut back the amount of butter to 1/4 cup, and I added some Feta along with mozzarella.  I found it reminded me too much of quiche which I'm not crazy about (It's that same spongy texture).  My mom liked it, but she loves quiche.

Delicious recipe, and I followed to a T, but they came out kind of soft even after cooking them for longer. I have to try it again with different measurements.

These are so delicious and addicting! The only changes I made were: I used two bags of spinach, cooked in the microwave & drained, used half the butter, Sautéed onion and garlic and used Italian Seasoning. I also used mixed Italian cheese and put parmesan on the top.   So good, this will be a regular appetizer in my home! Thanks for sharing BOWLINGNUT!

I followed the recipe except for a couple of changes: 
Instead of 1/2 cup butter, I used 1/4 cup Smart Balance butter spread
I added a generous amount of garlic
I used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup white flour
I added a pinch of red pepper

It was absolutely wonderful! My version was healthier but oh, it was just so good!

I thought this was absolutely delicious. I wanted to do something different and not so boring with the fresh spinach I had in the fridge but had to be quick and easy. It was quite simple to make. I had all ingredients on hand. It turned out great. I will make this again. But next time though I wouldnt put any salt in it or reduce the amount by half. Kind of depends if your using salted butter or not. Also I let this cook about 3-5 minutes longer to get a little bit golden. And make sure you chop the onions pretty small.

Very good recipe!  We made some additions & changes: sauteed a 6-oz pkg of mushrooms in approx 1/8 cup of olive oil, Separately sauteed 1 chopped carrot & and 1/4 chopped onion, chopped & 2 chopped celery stalks.  In the mix we replaced the butter with olive oil, adding 1/4 cup more to the mix.  Used shredded Monterey jack cheese and a shredded Colby-mozzarella blend into the mix.  Baked at 375 deg F for 45 min, then turned the oven off and spread shredded cheese on top and let set and melt in the oven.  Next time we will use even less oil.

It was great out of the oven fresh.  I followed some of the review comments.  Unfortunately, this did not serve well the second time.  It was terrible cold and did not reheat well.  I was embarrassed to serve this at the pot luck I went to.

Didn't change anything; it is really a blank but tasty slate that you can add lots of different flavors to.  We used it for snacks and as a platform for poached eggs.  The brownies will be on my Super Bowl table.

Great recipe used as a side dish. My husband laughed at me when I told him I was making spincah brownies, but guess what he loved it. He just kept raving how good it is and wants me to make it again. The only thing I added was a stalk of celery and I sauted the onions & celery then added the spinach to it after I took it out of the water.

This is a wonderful recipe either as is or used as a jump off for more adventurous fare.  I made it the first time exactly as written.  Well...one change.  I couldn't bring myself to use 1/2 cup of butter so I halved that since I was using a non stick skillet and the baking pan was going to be greased with more butter plus there would be more oil from the baking cheese.  Couldn't help trying a small piece shortly after taking it out of the oven. Personally I think I prefer eating it warm but cold was ok too.
Next time I make this I'm adding well sauteed mushrooms and crumbled fried smoked bacon to the mix just before baking.  I might use a slightly smaller baking dish too so the "brownie" isn't so thin.  
Thank you for a recipe I'll be playing with for years.

I used more spinach than it called for, and added bacon crumbles, but they were still pretty blah. I may try it again and make some of the changes other reviewers have tried.

I loved this recipe but of course I changed it.  I sauteed onion and mushrooms in olive oil instead of butter.  I added a pkg of ranch dressing mix with the dry ingredients and I also added bacon crumbles at the end (didn't use butter in the batter either).  It turned out absolutely delicious!  Will be making again.

I've made this twice as a dish to pass for appetizer parties.  It was a hit both times. The second time I added 1/2 cup of chopped bacon, so I didn't add additional salt and I reduced the butter by half.  GET CREATIVE with this recipe...it's very forgiving!  I've used Havarti cheese instead of Mozzarella and added minced garlic. It was delicious.

Hmmm,  very good! I did tweak it a bit with other reviews. I used less butter, sauted fresh spinach, onions, garlic and mushrooms. I added a hot portugal pepper and red peppers flakes. I only had about 4 oz of mozzarella so I added grated swiss cheese for the rest and topped with Parmesan after cooking.  Will be making this one a lot I suspect, easy to make and delicious.

Really good and super easy!  Like others, I halved the butter and sautéed onions and garlic first.  I also threw in some red pepper flakes.  I mixed everything ahead of time and let it sit in a bowl in the fridge until it was time to bake it.  Served this as the vegetable with dinner.

Tried this today . The flavor was good ,  but must agree that it is too oily for our tastes .  Baked for 40 minutes ,  and the bottom was a bit soggy .  We will try it again with less butter .

I love how versatile the recipe can be. The name itself sounds interesting and it is a quiche. I used half the butter and i added chopped garlic to the onion. I gave the garlic and onion a quick fry and set it aside. And yes, I drained the water off from the spinach, I thought that was pretty common sense. I am not sure if one egg can bind all the ingredients together, I just don't like the idea of an eggy dish. I hope to make it again using different kind of cheese (feta, maybe) and more vegetables like cherry tomatoes, watercress and turkey bacon.

Only one recommendation to make: DOUBLE THE RECIPE!!!  This was great as is and have made it quite a few times.  Over time I have tried it adding mushrooms and because my husband doesn't like mushrooms I tried cheddar and bacon and it was delicious.  I also have quit using frozen spinach and buy fresh and just wilt it in a pan with some butter which I highly recommend.  I took a double batch to a get together that had seven people and it was gone in under an hour and every single person asked for the recipe!!  I recently went on the atkins diet and made it with garbanzo bean flour and it was still phenomenal so people with gluten allergies REJOICE!  This was awesome.  Thank you so much for this wonderful simple recipe.

I doubled the recipe and it was a complete dud. I added mushrooms and used a shallot instead of onion but still,I could see people just didn't like it. It was bland. A lot left over.

Yummy! It was my first time putting anything in the oven to bake and I was super nervous since I was cooking for the king of the house (my father) but everyone loved it, no left overs!! I will admit I added way too much cheese but luckily we love cheese. I also added garlic and chopped up some tomatoes, super delicious! Just like everyone else says you can add other veggies you want to this dish and it'll come out great! Kept everyone distracted while I worked on dinner so its a great appetizer!!

Used one box of frozen spinach, sautéed the onion very good. Better at room temp yum! May add some extra veggies next time may be a fun recipe to experiment with

It is unfair of me to rate the recipe as written because I made a lot of changes and LOVED them. I thawed/drained 10 oz frozen/chopped spinach overnight.  Sauteed about 1/3 yellow onion & 1 clove garlic in 1 tbsp butter & about 1 tbsp olive oil (no other butter otherwise).  Used only 1/2 cup flour and also 1/2 cup italian bread crumbs.  Used about 1 cup six cheese italian blend and about 1/2 cup parmesan.  Cooked in muffin tin for about 20 minutes (15 may have been enough).  Looking forward to making again :).

This smelled and looked amazing coming out of the oven and I let it cool overnight to have in the morning. I added garlic and reduced the butter to 1/4 cup, but these "brownies" really just didn't sit well with me. The texture was almost congealed and in general the flavor was bland. Very disappointed as I was excited to try this recipe :(

I've been making this recipe for years and love it. I originally tried it as-is, but found them a little greasy. So like others, I cut the butter in half and double the spinach. It's so good. I also recently started baking them in an 8x8 pan, so they come out thicker.

This was very good. I went with suggestions of other reviewes and added another 10 oz pkg of chopped spinach (I used chopped spinach rather than buy regular spinach). It was easier. I added 4 chopped garlic buds to the onion and sauteed it (also suggested by another reviewer) cut the butter to 1/4 and increased salt by 1/2 tsp.  All the changes were recommendations by other reviewers and I think added flavor to the overall recipe.  I will keep this one.  It was enjoyed with the changes.

Delicious!  I used cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella.  It came out kind of mushy, but probably because I didn't cook it quite long enough.  Very much enjoyed by my dinner guests.

Delicious, but cut down the amount of suggested water to just a few tablespoons and be sure to squeeze all the liquid out of the spinach after cooking it. Brown the onions first (use vidalia onions). The addition of yellow raisins or craisins and chopped almonds makes it even better. Next time I will add cubed prosciutto or ham.

I used a 16 oz bag of chopped spinach.  Defrosted it and pressed the excess water out.  Sauteed an onion and 2 garlic cloves in a little olive oil, then added the spinach with a teaspoon of italian seasoning.  Added this to the other ingredients (4oz. butter)  It was delicious....a big hit at the luncheon I brought it to.

I made this tonight to go with our chicken and some oven baked parmesan potatoes. I used 2 packages of frozen spinach instead of fresh. I just thawed it out and drained it, didn't cook it first. I sauteed the onion in a little olive oil and then added 1/4 C butter, and once it melted I mixed that in with the other ingredients. I also added some garlic powder. Yummy!!

My first with the recipe and I didn't have mozzarella so I subbed with havarti and it was so good!  Made this to go with the juicy roast chicken recipe from this site (wish I could take credit for that excellent recipe) and some roasted new potatoes.  Life is good!

very good!! I also reduced the butter to about 1/4 C, using 1T to saute the onions and the addition of 1 t minced garlic as others recommended; then put the frozen spinach directly in the skillet to thaw; I also added some chopped roasted red peppers for flavor and color.  Used 1/2 C whole wheat flour, 1/2 C AP flour as another reviewer suggested. Took to a church potluck and every bite was eaten! So good, easy and versatile - I imagine it would be good with squash/zucchini, broccoli in place of or in addition to the spinach. I'll definitely be making this again!

I wasn't as impressed with this receipe as everyone else. I added bacon, sauted onions and garlic, and used mozzerella and cheddar cheese and I still thought it was a bit bland. I did cut back on the butter as other suggested but I think that changed the consistancy. I was expecting it to be a little more runny in the middle and instead it was very firm ... like a brownie and less like a quiche. It was still good and I may make it again but not for company.

Oh my godness. So yummy and so simple!! I used fresh spinach, added to sauted onions, then melted the butter in the pan, added it to the flour/milk/egg mix, stirred in some cheese and voila! A super fast, super tasty masterpiece!! Thanks for the recipe!

Really Yummy! I followed the comments and added bacon and then cooked the onion in the grease briefly before adding to mixture  (Only half the onion).  I feel like there was too much butter, and i never thought there could be such a thing, but with the bacon fat, it was overkill. Definitely a good recipe though! Will make it again.

I feel like Brooke.....I made a mistake. I forgot to add butter. I looked at this recipe so many times and I still forgot it! I made these for an appetizer for a family get together. I added chopped artichoke hearts, garlic powder, pepper and cayenne to the batter. And I used half white flour and half whole wheat. My brownies had to bake longer than 30 minutes but that wasnt a big deal. I thought this recipe was pretty good but I do think next time I will use feta like other suggested. It just needs a little OMPH.

Totally awesome & I can get it made as a side in under 30 minutes... which is a HUGE deal for my family. Like other pp's mentioned, I used frozen spinach and defrosted in the microwave. To alleviate the raw crunch of the onion, I added it to the bowl of spinach & it cooked down a bit while I had it on defrost. It wasn't like sauteing, but it had the same effect, thus one less step. I used 1/2 cup of butter, added garlic powder and Italian seasoning. Came out perfect. I have made this several times and I have also used feta cheese. Lovely recipe. thank you!

These "brownies" were delicious!  I'm a spinach fan anyway, but this was an excellent recipe.  I made it by the recipe to be able to do an honest review, but in the future some fresh ground nutmeg might be a nice touch.

I made this for dinner last night for the first time and my family loved it. I used fresh spinach and added salt to it while it cooked and it turned out perfect. This will become a frequently used recipe.

do NOT substitute two 10oz packages of frozen spinach for fresh.  there was waaaay too much spinach in the first batch i made.  i should've known better - fresh spinach reduces once it's cooked.  but i did what 'bownlingnut' suggested, and it was disgusting.  one 10oz package of frozen spinach is all that should be used.  

i also added a pound of cooked/crumbled bacon, sauteed a whole vidalia onion with garlic in 2tbsp of bacon grease, and about a tsp of onion and garlic powders.  finally edible.

These were delicious and so easy. I doubled the recipe (but only used three eggs and far less cheese and butter) and they came out very well, so I think it's a pretty versatile recipe. I brought these to a picnic and they were a hit! Also made an extra pan that I kept to use as easy workday breakfasts. I added bacon, and sauteed the onions in the bacon pan (after draining the grease but not cleaning the pan) before adding. Great recipe!

So quick, so easy! Everyone loved these- even my hesitant 5yo son!! The only thing I did differently is caramelized my onions first in the butter required for the dish. Great flavor, will definitely be making over and over again!

This is very good and it's a great way to use up a lot of spinach fast.  I cooked the onions in olive oil first, and then added the spinach to the frying pan to wilt it.  This is quick and easy and I think I'll use it a lot.

I halved everything since it was only for two people.  I also used frozen spinach, but everything else was the same.  We enjoyed the combo of the spinach and mozzarella, but it needed some seasoning.  My bf added hot sauce on top and said it was good that way.  Will try again and play with the seasonings a bit.  Great place to start!  Also, be sure to drain the water from the spinach.  I did this anyway, but from the reviews it looks like others did not.

This is a very easy and yummy dish. I made it for a Memorial Day family gathering and it was just about totally consumed! I, too, wilted the spinach after cooking the onion in the butter rather than boiling it. Will make it again very soon...thank you for this delightful recipe.

Wonderful way to cook spinach!  Baking it in a glass dish makes the outside a little crispy - yum! Used half wheat flour and half white flour, used only 1/4 cup butter, used frozen spinach (cooked), and only had cheddar cheese on hand.  Added chopped bacon bits too.

I halved this recipe and used one box of frozen spinach. To save on calories I used a skim milk and a tbs less butter. I did add a slice of bacon (so much for saving on calories), but it turned out fantastic, and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes spinach. My boyfriend loved it as well and he is hard to please.

Just made this and I can't stop going back for one more bite!  Sautéed the spinach with chopped onion and garlic.  Added black pepper and nutmeg and used a mixture of mozzarella, pepper jack, parmesan, and feta because that is what I had on hand.  Sprinkled wheat germ on top which I think made them extra yummy!

These are excellent.  I only used (1) 10 oz package of frozen spinach by accident, added feta and left everything else the same.  The feta added a little extra kick.  My 'spinach brownies" would have been thicker if I had used (2) 10 oz packages of frozen spinach.  However, they were perfect in flavor and texture as is.  The original recipe would not fail either.  Simple, quick and delicious. Enjoy!!

My husband and son loved these.  My husband is not the biggest vegetable fan so it is great to find something he enjoyed.  For convenience I used 2 boxes of chopped frozen spinach prepared in the microwave.  I substituted garlic powder for the salt for health reasons.  They still turned out great and I shall be making them regularly.

Yummy. I used frozen spinach but halved the recipe so I had to estimate how much to use. I just microwaved the spinach and then squeezed ALL the water out. It was really good. I am also not sure I used the full amount of cheese because I couldn't measure by oz., but I would guess I was under the full amount. I was afraid the onions would be too much but they weren't. What I like best is this isn't made with mayo or a can of something. It was quick to mix. I think maybe a crumbled bacon topping would be good, but I would make these again as is. Half a recipe was plenty for two adults and three kids. I used a 7x11 glass dish. Good for company!

I loved this dish. Was looking for a lighter - not creamy way to prepare spinach. I read the other reviews before and decided to sautee onion, bacon and mushrooms and seasoned them a lot, then added them with little butter to the mix. I also used a lighter cheese and a little bit of feta for more flavor.  It came out great, quick, easy and delicious. Thanks for the recipe!!

Pretty good but a little too salty.  Next time, I would use very little salt.  I also used less than 1/2 cup butter.  They are a little mushy, but I don't mind that personally.

Just perfect! I used olive oil to brown the onion and a tsp of garlic paste and then added the spinach... and added 3 tsp of butter later in the batter. Also I used only 1/4 cup flour and the rest gluten free flour..It still turned out perfect..Thanks for sharing the recipe

As suggested I used half whole wheat flour,reduced the butter to half a stick, cut back a little on the salt and used whole milk, since that's all I had and it was great!! I was going to take to a get together and it got canceled due to snow and my husband and ate most of it!:)

LOVE!! These are absolutely amazing. I've made them a few times already. I even added bacon one time and another time I added leeks instead of the onions. They both turned out delicious. Oh and they freeze pretty well.

first of all, i used a 1/4 cup olive oil instead of half cup butter.  i sauteed the onions with 4/5 cloves of garlic and mushrooms and then added the spinach.  i added chopped fresh basil, some italian seasoning and crushed red pepper.  also i used a mix of mozarella and cheddar cheese.  these are so addictive and tasty!

Pretty good. I used 1-16oz bag of frozen spinach which I cooked in the microwave as per package directions with 3 tbs of butter. I sautéed the chopped onion in 1 tbs of butter then once cooked down I added crushed garlic and cooked for another minute. I did a little extra salt, but it needed more. So next time I will try it with 2 tsp of salt. I think it will be better with different cheese or maybe topped with cheese. I only used 4 tbs of butter and I don't think it needed the whole stick.

Delicious! Because I wanted to make this with what I had on hand, I substituted 4 chopped green onions for the onion, powdered milk (reconstituted) for the milk, and cut the butter in half. Very aromatic while baking.

These are wonderful! The only change I have made is using fresh spinach and sauting it. Quick, delish and impressive!

Very tasty! My fiance went back for seconds and thirds! It probably didn't need as much butter though. I did cheat a little and replaced half the mozzarella with feta, which gives it a nice kick. Very good side dish.

i tried to make it "healthified" by using whole wheat flour, cutting the cheese (tee-hee) and butter in half.....don't do that! and you will probably be happier with the results, albeit fattening.....

Gluten Free!  I made these for a get together with friends.  They were yummy even with some substitutions.  In my household we have a gluten intolerant member so I thought I'd try the substitution of gluten-free all purpose flour.  We also tend to use soy milk so I substituted that, and I went a little shy on the butter (always watching that fat).  I didn't feel like hassling with fresh spinach, so used frozen (defrosted it and rung it out).  I took the suggestion of sauteing the onions but skipped the one about bacon.  In hindsight, I could have added some nutmeg (which typically goes well with spinach).  But they really were good.  I figured if anyone is gluten free, you should know that (unlike many other baked foods that don't do well with substituting GF flour) this came out great.  Love the cute name!

Easy, delicious and perfect as a side dish for a man who wont eat veggies normally.    It's basically spinach quiche without the crust.  Will make over and over again.

WOW! While the spinach was cooking, my DH said "I am not eating that!" Well, he ate his words after he tasted it...Really Good!  The only item thing changed was cooking the onions in a little butter first.  Will take another review and top this on french bread & cheese for an appetizer tomorrow :)

This is one of my all-time favorite spinach recipes.  I like to prepare as directed but then heat up leftovers in a lightly oil-sprayed skillet.  Then, the "brownie" gets slightly crispy on the outside and nice and warm on the inside.

This is a great recipe and as others have said it has a catchy name "Spinach Brownies". I try not to change alot when I make a recipe but I did follow the advice of another reviewer and saute the onions in 6 TBLS of butter instead of a full stick and I used a 20 oz bag of Spinach, and crusched peppers. But this recipe is very good my whole family liked it. Again thank you for the recipe I will be making again. The Peev

I liked this but I changed it a little bit and I think I will change it a little more the next time I make it.  I used 1/2 cup flour instead of a cup but still found it a little bready -- I wanted more of the taste of spinach and cheese.  Next time, I will probably increase the amount of cheese.  It may not hold together as well but I think it will have more spinach flavor.

This is absolutely divine.  I'm giving it 4 stars only because I used 2 1/2 T of butter and it was completely adequate - 1/2 cup of butter would be very greasy. I used onion powder and onion flakes, garlic powder, Italian seasonings, and ground pepper. I used a combo of mozarella and cheddar cheese.  I used 16 oz of fresh spinach which I steamed on the stove.  These "brownies" smelled SO GOOD while they were baking and they taste fantastic... even my little kids like it. These would be nice as mini muffins. Thanks for the recipe!

I really loved this recipe! It's a great idea, and it's been my breakfast for a week now. I did make some changes, as follows:  -I used 0.5 cup all-purpose flour, and 0.75 cup whole wheat flour  -I added three egg whites (which is why I added a 1/4 cup extra flour) on top of the 2 eggs  -I used FRESH spinach - a big, plastic container full of it - which I steamed separately.  -I added 1/2 cup of sun dried tomatoes, and a bunch of sliced mushrooms, to the onion while it sauteed  -I cut the melted butter in half  -the mozzarella cheese I used was part skim.  That's the way I made it, and it turned out just fabulous - kind of like quiche. I personally like it best cold, and it's easier to eat in squares that way, too.

These weren't terrible, but I thought they were too doughy and greasy. I followed the recipe exactly, but I think I would try making them again with double the spinach and half of the butter.

Mmm....these are delicious and very easy to make, but they're soo greasy!  Will probably use half the amount of butter next time I make them.  Also, I found the flavor could use a kick, would recommend adding 1/4-1/2 cup shredded cheddar along with the mozzarella.

This recipe is great! Since I'm vegetarian, I actually adapted this to a main dish for myself - I used 4 eggs instead of 2, cut the butter down to between 1/4 and 1/3 cup, and substituted feta for mozz. It was delicious! I will try this again per the recipe next time.

Oh this was great!  A simply wonderful way to eat spinach.  I carmelized the onions on the stove with a little garlic before adding them to the mixture.  I also used sharp cheddar for my cheese and sprinkled some on top for an extra little crunch.  My husband even liked them... and that's saying something.

This recipe got major points from my husband and two sons. They all told me that they definitely wanted me to make this again! I didn't have mozzarella, so used a low fat cheddar instead and it came out great, other than that, I followed the recipe to a t.

These are so easy to make and taste great! I have made these two times so far with two variations. The recipe is very forgiving, you can put anything in there. I did spinach with Italian sausage the first time, and then I did spinach with sun dried tomatoes the second time. Both turned out fabulous!

SO GOOD!  I sauteed the onion in 2 TBSP of butter for about 5 minutes and then added the spinach and cooked until it was wilted about 2 more minutes.  I forgot to chop the spinach and it turned out just fine.  I reduced the butter by the 2 TBSP but it was still really rich.  I'm going to cut the butter by half next time.  This was delicious with pasta, marinara sauce and crusty bread.  It's a keeper!

Really great recipe!  My twist is to add 1/2 to one teaspoon of dried italian seasoning blend, cut the amount of butter in half (and saute the onion in it), and substitute shredded parmesan for the mozzarella.  I also serve with marinara for dipping.  Big hit with adults and kids alike!

Any type cheese works.  And I greased the pan WELL and used 1/4 cup butter.  Also used fresh spinach and 3 diced asparagus stems.

Pretty darn good for my first harvest of spinach for the year. I would like to make it again sometime in the near future to see if I can decrease the flour taste a bit with bacon.

I rarely make a recipe without skimming most of the reviews, but this time I was in a hurry and decided to rely upon the positive star rating and make the recipe exactly as it's written.  Big mistake! I boiled the spinach and set it aside just as the recipe states.  My intuition/cooking sense told me "drain the Spinach" but I was in a hurry and didn't want to flop the appetizer so I re-read the recipe and it says nothing about draining the spinach.  I poured the spinach/water into the batter and hoped the mixture would somehow turn out okay even though it looked entirely too runny.  I let it bake for 50 minutes and it still wasn't firm.  Turned out to be a decent veggie side dish, but this recipe needs to be changed!

SO GOOD! This one is definitely going in our family favorites recipe book.   Sauteed the onion in 6 Tb butter till lightly browned, added chopped mushrooms & a few diced fresh jalepenos and cooked till tender, then added fresh chopped spinach and cooked a few mintues till it started to wilt.   Removed from heat to cool then added to the flour/egg/milk mixture with the cheese, etc.  I used three eggs vs two & added fresh ground black pepper, a little garlic powder, a few shakes of crushed red pepper flakes and a dash of ground nutmeg.  I used a pkg of Pizza cheese blend rather than only mozzarella.  I think next time I'll try it with cheddar.  It only took about 30 mins to cook (9x13 pan) and it had a gorgeous lightly toasted/browned top.  My son has already called the leftover bars for his snack tomorrow.

Absolutely devine!! I added bacon as suggested by another reviewer.  I highly advise doubling the recipe if you plan on serving more than a few people. They go too fast!

This was wonderful!  I didn't have enough mozzarella, so I added some feta.  It was so easy to make, and everyone at the party enjoyed it (a friend who is a chef even complimented me on it!). The plate was gone in less than 5 minutes, and people proceeded to pick at the bits in the pan :)  I will definitely make this again, maybe with some mushrooms or red peppers added in...

This is a very good finger food recipe! It's definitely a keeper for parties and church gatherings. I left out the onion and sprinkled thyme on top for flavor. Best served warm!

The first time I made these I used spinach and they were excellent.  The next time I didn't have spinach so used swiss chard (the red and green type).  It was delicious with the chard too but looked even better because of the colours. I will definitely make these again.

Pretty tasty!  I halved the recipe becasue there were just 3 of us and used an 8x8.  It seemed a litte low on liquid so I used 2 eggs and bit more milk.  Following others advice I added same onion and garlic sauted in a little butter, and skipped the rest of the butter.  I also used fresh chopped spinach (rather than cooking first) and mixed a little fontina cheese with the mozz.  I would make again, but bake lower than 375 to get a little less browning.

Easy to make and surprisingly flavorful! I acidentally (it was almost 1am) put these in an 8x8 instead of a 9x13, big mistake as they took *forever* to bake, almost on hour and they probably could have gone even longer but i was tired. So make sure you use the right size dish. Of course this is my fault not the recipe's.  But I didn't give it five stars for two reasons. First off it says use fresh spinach but being as it gets cooked down anyway I saw no benefit to this, next I'll definitely use frozen and save some time. And second, it does taste a little flour-y I might try to scale back the flour next time and add another egg to make up for it.   Other than that this recipe is very good, I was tempted to add a little more seasoning but I held back and am glad I did, they taste just fine (seasoning wise) as is.   they were easy and a little different, I'll definitely make again. Thanks for the recipe!!

Yum! Just came out of the oven and I am eating it as we speak. Reminds me of quiche, but with less egg. I will definitely make this again.

Very buttery but very tasty. I would recommend reducing the butter to 1/4 cup. I used a 6oz bag of fresh baby spinach and found that to be plenty. *Dont forget to squeeze the water out of the spinach.

These are very good but very rich.  I would cut way back on the butter if I make these again.  A simpler way to cook the spinach is just to steam it with a little bit of water...less to squeeze out.  The recipe gives no instructions for draining the spinach.

I made this for a potluck luncheon at work and everyone raved! I made a couple of changes though...the butter amount seemed excessive so I cut it to about 3 Tbsp and used it to saute the onion as well as some red pepper and garlic with a good dash of black pepper. Instead of the mozza I used a cup of crumbled feta for a more greek-style flavour. LOVE this.

i make this everytime i go home and its gone in a few hours time! i altered it quite a bit to my taste. i skip the butter, and instead saute the vegetabes in olive oil. i use chopped garlic, onion, spinach, tomato, onion, mushrooms. at some point i will try artichokes too. maybe sometime ill make a broccoli version. then i just top that combination with cheese. i use pepper and garlic powder usually. turns out greattttt!!

Cooking the spinach before adding it seemed like overkill, so I just used chopped fresh spinach.  I think this gave the finished product a good texture, and more of a "straight from the garden" appeal.  I served this at a gathering and got several requests for the recipe. Could be fun to try adding green pepper or using Swiss instead of mozzarella.  Hmmm...

Didn't have mozarella cheese, so I added about 1/3 cup Kraft parmesan and 1/2 cup freshly grated.  Also added a minced garlic clove and sprinkled extra garlic powder, onion powder and pepper.  Only put about 1/2 cup of fresh onion since I already had it chopped up in the fridge.  Put it in a Pyrex dish that wasn't quite 9"x13".  Received numerous compliments from both BIL and hubby!

Oh wow! Can't wait to make these again! Used half the butter, half mozzarella and half serving cheddar cheeses, parmesan cheese on top, added more garlic, fat free milk, and increased or added other spices we like.  Going to try a variation with other veggies like squash or broccoli.

Made this for a church social today and only got one for myself because they were gone so quickly, although I did receive MANY complements!!!  I followed the advice of "the most helpful reviewer", Hima and added some extras.  This is a great appetizer, but needs a few changes to recipe as written.

These were excellent!  I also cooked the onions before mixing them in.  I also added a little chedder cheese on top.  I used canned spinach for the recipe, because I just decided to make them last minute and had it on hand.  They still tasted absolutely wonderful!  They have a lot of flavor.

Used the base recipe and added additional veggies that I had on hand.  Sauteed veggies (onions, bell pepper, mushrooms, asparagus) turned off the pan and added spinach to wilt. Crumbled bacon and added.  I also added hot sauce to the batter.  It reminded me a little of a spinach pizza.

Dang these were so good, I ate like 4 in 10 minutes. They are really good when they are hot! I made some changes though. After reading so many reviews about reducing the butter I added only half, I sauted the onions before I mixed it in. Also I added a little garlic powder, pepper, and about 1/2 tsp. more salt. Also since I used frozen spinach I just microwaved it instead of boiling them. Yum Yum Yum! One of my favorite recipes! Give em a try!

I'm giving this 5 stars with the mods I did, I didn't try the original recipe *blush*.  I added shredded carrots, peppers, garlic, pepper and 1/2 lb of bacon.  I cooked the bacon, drained the fat, added the onion & peppers, then the spinach and lastly the carrots & garlic.  Used 1/2 the butter but added one more egg.  Excellent!

Nice recipe..bacon would be a great addition, however, these are not brownies! This is a crustless quiche or a frittata cut into squares. The word brownies doesn't really refer to the shape of the food, brownies are chocolaty and sweet. The title of this recipe is way off and doesn't appear when you search for a breakfast dish with eggs and spinach, it comes up with chocolate brownie recipes..sorry, just a personal pet peeve!

Good recipe, and I have to agree with one review that it does need a little spice to it, I added cheese but that wasn't it. I will tweak this recipe a bit more.

I made these for the first time Friday night and was so hoping they would be good.  While I think the recipe is a great start I was disappointed in the lack of flavor.  The recipe didn't call for any seasoning but I added black pepper and salt and wished I had added more.  I will make again but will definitely season more and maybe try saute some garlic in with the onion.  Nice recipe to build on.

these are pretty good, but adding some bacon makes this a 5 star recipe! i added 4 slices of bacon that had been cooked and crumbled, sauteed the onion in the bacon grease before i added it, and reduced the butter to about 2 tbsp.

It's a fabulous basic recipe that is a springboard for so many different ideas.  I tried once with the spinach, but I only had one egg.  The result was a much more dense rich dish.  The second night I didn't have enough spinach so I used two tomatoes and a can of drained mushrooms.  This time I had two eggs, and the dish was fluffy and light.  I followed other suggestion of halfing or omitting the butter atogether and sauting the onions and adding bacon.  It's been fantastic both times.

My wife and I absolutely love this! (Eating it right now) I made it as something to snack on while I made dinner and it has become dinner. I do not like spinach at all, but was looking for a way to eat it for the health benefits. This is fantastic! Try it!

These were great, I made a couple of minor changes though. I sauteed the onions before adding them to the mix and I also added 3 slices of cooked bacon that I had leftover. The bacon turned out to be a great addition. I really enjoyed them and will make again.

I was disappointed with this one. The onions were too overpowing and took away from the other flavors in the recipe. I might try to make it again and substitute another vegetable for the onions.

I just made this recipe for guests coming tomorrow and couldn't wait for it to cool before trying it. Fantastic!! I'm afraid they might not make it till tomorrow!! I followed the recipe with the 2 boxes of frozen chopped spinach instead of the fresh. I also cut the butter in half as suggested and added another egg and 2 heaping tablespoons of flour since some of the other reviewers said it wasn't of a firm texture. I did throw in some extra mozzerella cheese and sprinkled the top lightly with shredded parmesan for my own tastes. The texture is great, not too eggy or cake like, just perfect. Next time I might experiment with the bacon too. Thanks for this recipe!!!

ELIMINATE THE BUTTER all together, it is not necessary.  Or, at the least reduce it by half.  This is such a simple, yet delicious recipe.  I add a can of sliced drained mushrooms every time.  This recipe is very versatile.  Tonight I am making it with tomato, asparagus and goat cheese instead of spinach.  I have passed this recipe on to many people.  Thanks for the great recipe! :)

Wonderful! Used 1/4 c butter instead of 1/2 c, threw in a little feta that I had, some garlic, and maybe 1/4 cup parm too. This was really good. Froze individually wrapped servings.  Great low carb breakfast!!

We really enjoyed these.  But next time I would use 1/2 the butter maybe even less.  They were very greasy!  But the flavor was good!  I added a clove of galic and a little fresh parslet (trying to use it up)which was a good addition.  Will make again - just less butter!  Thanks for the recipe!

Good recipe.  The only alteration I made was using frozen spinach.  The second time I made them I used 4oz mozz. and 4oz. feta and that was great as well.

These were really good, didn't have enough mozzerella so I added some parmesean to make up the difference.  I liked them cold, I ate a piece for breakfast every day until it was gone.  It tastes like if you made a spinach and onion pizza, and ate the toppings off after baking.

Oh yeah!  So good and easy.  My 21 year son thinks he's hot stuff making this for me.  Whoever wrote that this doesn't last long is right.  I just leave the pan on the top of my stove and by the end of the day it's gone.

We loved these, I used a box of frozen spinach which defrosts perfectly in the microwave for 5 and 1/2 minutes, used 1/4c. butter instead of the full 1/2. Sauteed the onions and 2 cloves of minced garlic, added 1/4c pecorino romano and about 1 to 1 1/2c. of a shredded pizza blend cheese. Thought the consistency was great, not too eggy, not dry. Very tasty and my girls loved them.

Great recipe.  I followed it almost exactly except that took several reviewers advice and used 1/2 mozzarella and 1/2 cheddar, and only 1/4 cup of butter, using that to sautee the onions and spinach.  I may try frozen spinach next time, since the preparation of the fresh spinach took a while.  
Adding garlic sounds like a good idea too.  My 17 month old ate as many as I did - great way to get in her spinach - As she says, YUM!

The idea for this recipe was good, the end result was bland.  I made this for my NYE party and was disappointed with the taste.  Next time I will use pepperjack and add some bacon.  They just needed a little kick!  I baked them in little star shaped pans and they turned out nice.

delicious! the only thing is, in my haste to make this recipe & devour it as quickly as possible, i overlooked the "lightly grease the pan" step (doh!). well, that won't stop me from scraping every last crumb from the pan! i only did 2 things differently: 1) i sauteed the onions & the spinach together, rather than boiling them, & 2) i mixed black pepper into the batter right before pouring it into the pan. i'll definitely be making this recipe again in the future, maybe adding in garlic as other reviewers have suggested, & experimenting with different cheeses. a wonderfully tasty way of getting in another serving of vegetables!

I sauteed the onions and added feta.  I think these are really good as a side dish to spaghetti or anything related to marinara sauce.  I've already made them twice, will definitely make again.

So great.  I cooked it for an additional ten minutes to make the crust extra crispy.

I've been meaning to make these for almost 2 years, and tonight I finally did.  All I can say is ADDICTIVE!  I cut my batch up into 12 squares, and I ate 3 of them!  When I make a recipe for the first time, I usually always stick to the actual recipe.  The second time I make it is when I might change things up a bit.  This was fantastic without any changes!  Next time I might saute the onion, add different cheeses, use a mixture of flours, or use any of the other many suggestions given by reviewers, but I think the recipe, as written, is definitely a keeper.  Thanks very much for sharing!

Amazingly delicious!!  I substituted egg beater eggs for real eggs, fat free cheese, skim milk and light butter and the spinach squares turned out beautifully.  Wonderful recipe.  Experiment with different cheeses for a variety...you can't go wrong with this one.

These are good and work well with any sauteed cooking green (kale, collards, chard, mustard greens, beet greens, turnip greens).  You can also cut the cheese amount in half and still have darn tasty squares.  I use a combination of mozzarella and Parmesan.

Gosh, I was terribly disappointed tonight with this dish.  I remember making them a couple years ago and it being a hit.  I can't really point where it went wrong tonight.  Really?  All that butter?  Jeez, when I cut into this thing I saw it was literally sitting in a pool of butter.  It made consumption difficult.  I should edit my favorite recipes before the night is over so I don't run into this situation again 2 years down the line.  I remember this recipe being so very tasty and hard to stop eating.  I cannot say that tonight.  Next time I will definitely use less butter than what the recipe calls.

5 Star Plus!  Added parmesean cheese, some red pepper flakes and some spices to jazz it up but they were a hit!  Someone said they tasted fancy because I cut them into Triangles LOL!  I called them spinach bars, brownies just don't sound good!  But phenomenal!

Make sure to leave plenty of time for cooling before cutting into bars.

I'm just geting in to cooking and love spinach. I found this recipe very easy and fun to make. However I added 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese and a little more shreeded cheese as my family is a cheese lover. A must try recipe!

I made these tonight for some friends and they were a big hit!  I made several changes based on the reviews here.

-I used baby spinach, sautéed not boiled.
-I sautéed the onion and added garlic as well.
-I used 1/4 cup butter and slightly less milk.
-I added sautéed cremini mushrooms and crumbled bacon (I used the ready crisp real bacon bits) as well as lots of freshly ground black pepper.

I served them with marinara sauce for dipping.  My husband described these as a cross between quiche and pizza.  Next time I will use an Italian cheese blend instead of just mozzarella for a bit more intensity.

I will be making these again I just wish I could come up with a better name!

I didn't personally like these - the spinach flavor wasn't masked very well! But my husband loved them - so I guess it's different for everyone.

I love this recipe, but rated it four stars because I changed it a bit per other reviewers. I added minced garlic, and cut back on the butter. I also added some fresh ground pepper. I have made these with both mozarella and feta cheeses and I think our favorite is the feta. I have also added some chopped mushrooms. I do reccommend that you saute the onions so they are a bit softer. Thanks for a great and healthy snack recipe that my whole family enjoys!!

Made these last night, and in spite of the spinach groans they got a big hurrah once cooked. Followed the recipe exactly, and it was perfect! Definately wait to serve until cooled, as recommended. This lets them finish setting up. Mmmmm!

Great! I followed other reviewers' advice and cut the butter down to 2 tablespoons. I sauted the onions in the butter first, and I used an Italian Blend cheese. This would also be good for brunch---you could cut it in larger squares and serve it with a fresh tomato salsa.

made these this morning for a work function. Everyone loved them. i took the suggestions and cut the butter down to 1/4 cup and even cut the milk to 3/4 cup and didn't have a bit of problem with them being soggy. However i thought they were a little dry so i will add the full cup of milk and maybe a little more then 1/4th cup butter next time. The whole pan was gone in one hour so it still turned out well. i also added more spices. Next time i will add artichoke hearts and more fresh garlic.

I was slightly disappointed with this. It sounded really great but it came out okay. I baked these for over an hour and they still were slightly soft and never came clean in the middle with a toothpick. Plus there was butter drenched on top. I suggest like others cutting the butter at least in half. Besides the baking I found it a little bland even with the  modifications I made which included sautéing the onion in butter plus Portobello mushrooms and garlic. I also added ground red pepper, salt, black pepper and with all this it was okay. I really didn’t want to finish it.

Too easy and Too good! I used 1 bag of Fresh Spinach used and a bag of italian shredded mixed cheeses (Mozz, Prov, Asiago) b/c some people said not a whole lot of flavor with just the Mozzarella.  I added a lil olive oil, 2 Tablesppons garlic & 1 Tablespoon Janes Crazy mixed up salt.  My guests and husband ate the whole thing and I made another batch.  BUT on my second batch I added crumbled bacon (approx. 1 1/2- 2 cups)  And it was FANTASTIC.  There is a lot of butter in this as you will see when you take it out of the oven.  I will try to cut it down next time.  I will make this from now on at least a few times a month.  Flavors come out when warm/hot not so much when cold.  It is A+

These were good, but I thought they could use more flavor.  I did add garlic powder and cayenne, but think bacon would have made them great!  Will add bacon next time.  I did sauté the onion and spinach in the butter (only used 1/2 a stick).  Might also try with some feta.  Good recipe to play around with.

This is a definite five for me -- I'm a spinach lover and this was great.  My husband is a spinach endurer, and he said it was worth 3 stars.  My kids detest spinach and I didn't even ask them to try this.  I do wish I had added more salt, as I ended up adding it afterward.  I also think I ended up putting in more spinach than needed, but it was great.  I added garlic powder and cayenne pepper to punch it up just a little bit.  A definite keeper -- I'll be making this every week.
Thanks!

I made the recipe exactly as written and it turned out perfectly.  There IS a lot of cheese in it.  I like cheese, so it was okay for me, but those who aren't so fond of cheese might want to make it with less.

Ok...name sucks...but this was actually very tasty.  I didn't add butter and used low fat cheddar instead of mozza.  As well I spiced it up a bit (paprika, oregano, garlic powder and cayenne).  My husband says the only thing that would make this better would be the addition of crumbled bacon...will try that next time!

These turned out great! I did make a few changes, though. Instead of using fresh spinach, I used 2 (10 oz.) pkgs. of defrosted frozen chopped spinach. Also, instead of using all mozzarella cheese, I used 4 oz. of crumbled gorgonzola and 4 oz. of shredded mozzarella/provolone combo. I also added a clove of garlic and sprinkled the brownies with parmesan cheese before baking. I would also recommend serving these warm, tastes a whole lot better.

This is terrific.  Much like a crust-less quiche.  I had to cook mine a bit longer to get the middle done.  Yum!

I made this using the two 10 oz packages of frozen spinach. I think that made for too much spinach, because the brownies turned out too dense and heavy. I brought them to my woman's club meeting and they were barely touched.

Simple to make, surprisingly rich flavour.  I halved the recipe and cut down the amount of butter, and it turned out well.  Think broccoli would also taste nice.  Will make again and try adding some other veggies and cheeses.

This is the first recipe that I've rated on here and I have to say there's a reason!  These are very good.  I took them to work 'just because' and I got many compliments!  I added some chopped fresh mushrooms and it was great.  I'm just concerned about the amount of cheese (fattening) and wonder about using a reduced fat variety... not sure how it would mix and bake, though.  Thank you Trudi!

I have tried these a couple of times and there is just something missing.  I added red pepper flakes and changed the cheese to montery jack and they were still a little bla.  Also they do not keep well overnight.  Sorry but i think this recipe is a goner from my box

I used organic eggs, cauliflower flour, turmeric ghee, and vegan mozzarella. 

It did not come out like the picture (prob my substitutions) 
They were moist cake like. Tasted good

I used half the butter (1/4 cup), sauteed garlic and onions and added it to the cooked spinach, also added a 6 oz. can of mushrooms drained. Used 5 oz. of mozzarella with 3 oz. feta cheese and 2 oz. swiss cheese, sprinkled the top with shredded parmigian cheese. This was a hit!

A big hit at the Secret Santa party. One of us is a vegetarian, but even the non-vegs loved these. Personally, they're my new favorite snack, and I'm not veg at all.

Delicious!
My whole family loved it! 
I will definitely make this again because not only is it tasty, but it is also super easy make.
Next time I prepare it, I will add a little less butter. But overall, excellent!

Thanks for the inspiration! I just added my first recipe (Keto Quiche) to Allrecipes because of this dish. I made a modified version of this over Christmas for my Keto following family  and they loved it!!! I tripled the eggs, reduced the butter, substituted almond and coconut flour, and added some bell peppers. I have also made this with broccoli instead of onion.

This is a wonderful base recipe! I made it using feta cheese, and found I didn't need to add the salt. I've added onions, black olives, chopped red or green peppers, bacon.....use your own imagination!

Great flavor, was a hit with the whole family.  The only thing I did different was I had a 16 oz bag of spinach instead of the 10 oz it called for.

Made these as an appetizer in mini muffin tin. Sauteed onions and garlic then added spinach to wilt as suggested by others. They turned out delicious.  Will definitely be making again

Absolutely delicious. I added garlic, cayenne & crumbled turkey sausage. Red pepper flakes on top added zing to the leftovers straight outta the microwave. So good. I used 8oz sharp cheddar vs mozz as that’s all I had on hand. Will duplicate additions for next time as well.

Got a few odd looks when answeing, "spinach brownie" lol. 

Between the directions and taking into account some reviews, here's what I did.... 
I sauteed the onions, added bacon and red, orange, yellow peppers and used fresh spinach. 
There were concerns about to much butter, so I just used the butter that I sauteed the onions in and I didn't add any more (like the recipe calls for). I did grease the pan with butter though, generously. 

Overall, it was very good. I was well pleased! 
Bonus* Add cranberry sauce to it and it's like a dessert ;)

This was ok. It seemed the spinach flavor got lost in the brownie. Perhaps that's the point for some. My picky eater certainly enjoyed these. They actually taste better the next day.

I stumbled upon this recipe at least 10 yrs ago, it has become a favorite among everyone who has ever tried them and so now I feel quite obliged to write a review.
I love how easy this recipe is to change to fit anyone's liking. I have made this recipe exactly as written, as well as changed up almost the whole dish itself. I love adding bacon and using the grease in place of the butter. I have added fresh herbs to this like parsley, oregano and basil. I have also used half and half spinach/kale as well as entirely replaced the spinach with kale. (I am not a fan of kale but it is soooo delicious in this recipe) Every single time I have used this recipe it ALWAYS comes out absolutely DE-LISH. I have even made this for children ranging all different ages as young as 9mos and older and ALL of them love it too, they ask me to make it all the time. Not to mention it is SOOOO EASY to make, almost effortless. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe it has become our families favorite!!

I  sauteed baby spinach and onion in some  of the 1/2 C butter from the recipe but still followed the recipe.. I didn't want to steam the spinach. I LOVED IT! It was so good! I used a 9x9 dish not a 9x13 and it worked perfectly. I didn't have any problems that    others had. My husband & son didn't care for it but they are both miserable picky eaters  who hate all veggies so they're opinion doesn't count!

I love this recipe! It's such a unique way to use spinach and it tastes great! I have been devouring the leftovers since my mom made it. My mom added garlic to boost the flavor and I think it helped.

My whole family loves these. I have made them as usual and I have also added bacon and baked them in mini muffin tins for more of a appetizer.

I had to become a member to rate this.  I love it.  I served it with homemade ranch and it was super.  I've eaten a quarter of the pan and I'm afraid I'm not done.  I might try to use half the butter next time.

I used garlic powder because I had no cloves, and I forgot to add the powder to the mixture so I had to sprinkle it on the top after it had already been baking a few minutes, and it was still great.  I used the convection oven and a metal pan, and it made the bottom of the bars nice and brown.

I could have eaten the whole pan in one sitting (and believe me, I wanted to). Even the aroma is wonderful while it’s baking. This recipe is nearly perfect. I plan to make it the next time I entertain. The only tweak is that I halved the butter for the second batch - and it’s just as tasty.

I didn't want all of the flour and milk so I cut that down to 1/4 cup of each. The result may be too thin for some people but it tastes divine and has a lot less carbs and calories. 

Great!

Excellent make ahead breakfast food for the week.   Cook a little turkey sausage on the side to make it the perfect little breakfast. I did what others suggested with bacon and roasted red pepper.  Delish! Did not add melted butter to mixture.  Next time will try it instead with almond milk, goat cheddar and manchego so the lactose intolerant in my family may eat it.

Less butter and sauteed onion as suggested. Used 2/3 Mozzarella and 1/3 parmesan cheese.  Should have spiced it up a bit, but it was well received.

Easy to whip up. Made a change or 2 though: sauteed mushrooms in 1TBS butter in a large skillet until most all moisture was gone then added the fresh spinach and covered with a lid for 5 mins. After mixing mushrooms and spinach into the wet mixture I used the same skillet to melt the butter. Also swapped the 1 tsp salt for 1 tsp black pepper and a pinch of salt.

I've had a recipe very close to this one for many years, and have made it often.  They're always a huge hit when I take them to potlucks & cookouts.  One thing...these SHOULD be called "Spinach Bars" NOT "Spinach Brownies".

Thank you for a very easy recipe for a great snack or breakfast.  I followed the recipe as directed and can see the countless option to add to this- Left over broccoli, various cheeses.  I do wish i had added garlic and will in the future along with other spices as it was bland- but a great base- and so easy to make!

So this is my second time making this. The first time I made as is, and it was wonderful. This time when I made it my mom wanted me to half the recipe, so I did that. Then I added some onions from a celery and onion mix my mom bought from the store, and then I decided to add some sausage, which I cooked before mixing into the quiche (in my head this recipe is a quiche). I love this recipe, and I plan to have some more fun with this recipe as I go on.

These are always a family favorite. I’ve made this recipe multiple times. I use fresh spinach, chopped finely.   Cut the butter in half, and almond milk instead of white.

Wow, this was good!  I followed other reviewers in cutting way back on the butter.  I used fresh spinach, added onions and seasonings, feta instead of mozzarella.  I am going to try doubling this recipe for a thicker "brownie".  If it works out, these will be going in the freezer and grabbed for a quick and delicious breakfast.

I added extra spinach and instead of 2 eggs, I used 1 egg and 2 egg whites. It came out too "wet" and I needed to let the item sit for a bit to solidify, but tasted fine.

This was a big hit at my party.  When my daughter, who is a health nut, saw it she thought it wouldn't be good.  It was terrific.  I only used one bag of frozen spinach and that was plenty.

This was good. Mine was a little doughy, but that may have been my fault. I cut the butter back to 1/4 cup and think that it could have used the original amount. Next time, I'd add some more cheese on top in the last few minutes of baking. We also like our onions cooked, which I recommend doing before baking. Overall, very good. I'll cook as written next time and see if that solves the "dough" taste.

I've made this several times and it's fantastic! It's similar to a quiche, but firmer in texture. I typically make it just as the recipe states - except for one adjustment: I reduce the butter to a 1/4 cup. The first time I made it, the butter was oozing on top. It still tasted good, just greasy.

Tasty! Almost halved the butter. Could use even more cheese and flavor. Will try adding parm and/or more mozzarella.

Be sure to press all the water out of the spinach if you're using fresh - it comes out amazing. Tossed in a few roasted walnuts for an additional 'brownie' effect!

I liked this recipe very much (a little too much salt for my tastes).  The 2nd time I used 1/2 t salt, pepper jack monteray cheese (about 6 ounces) and added a heaping 1/4 cup of cottage cheese.  Definitely a keeper, thank you!

Meh, nothing spectacular. Followed the recipe mostly. Sautéed the onion with fresh spinach. Added some garlic powder. Felt like it was missing something... maybe needed parm cheese. Probably won't make again.

These turned out really good. I carmelized the onion and added a couple cloves of garlic at the end of the sauté time. Everyone loved them.

These are great!  I used fresh spinach since I had it on hand and quinoa flour because I can't eat gluten.  I can't wait to try them again with  Parmesan cheese.

Ate 4 before I slapped my fingers to stop.  Recipe calls for FRESH spinach. I steamed it until wilted and squeezed out some of the liquid.  I used a med-large onion diced small, but did not saute' it, as that would have reduced the flavor intensity.   I cut the salt in half,  added 1/8 tsp pepper, and cut the melted butter to 2 Tb.  I used 3 oz. Mozzarella and 3 oz. provolone.   It would also be great exchanging the provolone for Swiss or Parmesan.  Placed this  in a 7.75 x 12" Pyrex lined with parchment.

These are really good and freeze beautifully!  I use for breakfast for my 18 month old daughter and I, it's a great way for me to get spinach into her.  Only changes I make is I add another egg, caramelize the onion a bit, and use a mix of mozzarella and cheddar cheese.

I just took these out of the oven and they are fabulous! Based on other reviews I only used 1/4 cup of butter, of which I used a tbsp to sauté the onion some garlic and the spinach. I used some ground black pepper and a few red pepper flakes. Once everything was mixed and in the pan, I added a handful or so of shredded Parmesan. I will definitely make again, and added feta next time around.

I had to make this IMMEDIATELY when I found the recipe today, and I'm glad I did! 

I only made TWO TWEAKS  to this recipe:  I took the other members advice and cut the amount of melted  butter by half.  Even then, the mixture still looked a little too "soupy" so I added another quarter cup of flour and then baked it in my beloved brownie pan for about 35 minutes.
They came out PERFECTLY!!!!

Was hoping this would be an easy way to enjoy the flavors of SPANAKOPITA, but it did not meet my expectations.

Just too bland. I cut the butter in 1/2 as suggested and it still seemed a little greasy/heavy.

I did sauté the onions in the butter, added sone garlic herb spice I had on hand and added a can of mushroom pieces that i drained first.  I did use frozen spinach (but only 1 10 oz. box, - didn't read that i should use 2 until after it was made) but it was still enjoyed by all!

This was a huge hit at Christmas brunch. However, one stick of butter is entirely too much. It is still delicious with only half.  I use steamed fresh spinach instead of frozen. Also good with cheddar cheese.

I enjoyed this. Definitely good enough for me to make again. Pre cooked the onions and substituted 1/2 cup whole wheat flour for half of the white flour. My 1 year old ate it up.

Pretty good and easy!  After reading reviews, I cut butter in half and it was fine.  I could see spicing the recipe up a bit with a bit of cayenne, etc.  I like the bacon idea too.  Will make again with some tweaks and it will then be 5-star!

So good! I did deviate from the recipe a little though--I only added 3/8 cup of butter and I added 1/2 lb bacon. I used a full pound of fresh baby spinach. I also only used about 1/3 of a yellow onion and I sauteed it with some minced garlic before adding it. Cutting down on the butter was definitely a good thing--it was pretty greasy. Next time I will add slightly less bacon, slightly less salt (since the bacon gives it some saltiness) and 1/2 a white onion and see how that turns out.

Yummy! Almost all of us liked it. (my anti-spinach kids still didn't eat it.) I sautéed onion and about 5 cloves garlic first. Cut butter in 1/2 .  Really good! Thanks for the recipe!

I've made these many, many times and they're excellent! I've never taken any home from a potluck, they're always a huge hit. If you make them, I'd recommend using sweet onions and slightly less butter than in the recipe, otherwise it's perfect as-is.

Wonderful! Addictive! Work well as a companion with chili, but the next morning also served it with breakfast casserole and could easily call these "spinach quiche bars" – absolutely fabulous. So easy!

Carmalized the onions. Added crispy pancetta squares. Deleted the butter. Squeezed out as much water as possible from the spinach. And added some garlic. Topped with Parmesan on top and it looks nice and crispy. Taking it to a appetizer potluck tonight and can't wait to try it!!!

Great way to incorporate veggies onto my children's diet-ages 14, 11, and 6. They all loved it!  I sautéed 2 cloves garlic, 1 small onion in 1 tbsp. Smart Balance, added 1  7-oz bag of fresh spinach, sprinkled salt and pepper and Italian seasoning. For the "batter" I used whole wheat flour, skim milk, mozzarella made with 2% milk (came in a 7 oz bag), 3 Tbsp. real butter, then sprinkled parmesan cheese to cover the top before baking. Savory. Thanks for posting and for all the reviews.

As other reviewers mentioned, I cut back on the butter.  Also, with the onion, I cooked up some sausage and garlic and it was amazing.  The whole family loves it.  Something for a twist I also add a 6oz package of feta.

Very easy.  Made it for appetizer.  I added some Pampered Chef Fiesta Mix to spice it up.  I would do that again.  For a dinner I would add some ham and put it in a 9x9 pan to make it a bit deeper.  The bacon idea is also a good suggestion from others that I will try.

I made this for a gathering and everyone loved them. I think they would still work out nicely with less butter because they were a bit oily. Also next time I may add some ham.

A really good way to get the kids to eat their spinach. Our family enjoyed it, but next time I make it I will use less butter. It seemed a little greasy especially since we added a little bacon.

I love spinach artichoke dip and thought this would be a good recipe to try making that change on my first attempt. I cut the butter down to 1/4 cup as I wanted to limit the fat calories and used 10 oz frozen spinach and a can of artichoke hearts which I drained and diced. Not extremely firm but can be eaten with fingers easily enough. Cut into 16 servings it yields about 130 cals each. Yummy!

This is my go to potluck item. I add feta cheese and sundried tomatoes to it, sometimes I play around with different cheeses, but it always turns out great. I do saute the onions with the tomatoes and some freshly chopped garlic in the butter, about half the amount of butter, and then wilt the spinach with that mixture. One pan and done. They taste great warm, room temp or cold.

I have made this recipe twice now with success. Once as a party appetizer and it got lots of compliments. The second time I made a batch, cut it into squares and froze them as part of a freezer cooking session. They thawed well and still tasted great. Nice recipe!

Tried this tonight for a social gathering pot luck since it had such great reviews.   Add more rave reviews from the party goers.   Took the advice of some other readers and cut the butter (by half).  Not sure if it made any difference but I used a sweet onion instead of a normal cooking onion.  Also substituted almond milk instead of dairy milk (since we don't drink dairy milk) and it was still awesome.  Thanks for posting this recipe BOWLINGNUT

When made as written, it's a good appetizer. All the butter makes it very, very rich and anything more than a two inch square is overkill for me. If you're making this to get more spinach into your diet or as a side, cut the butter and cheese down and throw in some garlic powder, sun dried tomatoes, bacon or really anything to replace all of that fat flavor. That way it is more a meal item than an indulgent treat.

These are delish and different, but recipe calls for too much butter and they were quite greasy. I would cut the fat amount in half next time.

So delicious!  Everyone just gobbled them up when I make them...especially the kids.  They taste good warm or at room temp.  We even eat the leftovers for breakfast.  Fresh garlic is a good addition.

Could give this more stars!  Added mushrooms to the sauted onions and used frozen spinach. Used 1/2 butter..Awesome dish! ***update*** diced carrots and added that to the onion/mushroom saute.  Hubby likes cheese more that I so added 1/2 cheese to the mix and then used other 1/2 to top his side

I made this for a get-together tonight.  They were a hit!  I changed the recipe after reading some of the reviews.  I used 4 tablespoons of unsalted butter, sauteing the onion and adding three cloves of garlic, minced to it, too.  I also used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup white flour instead of all white flower.  We don't use cow milk, so I used almond milk and it worked fine.  These were gone very fast at our gathering and I'll definitely make them again soon.

I love anything spinach! I followed the recipe almost exactly. I the substitutions I made were skim milk instead of whole milk and country crock light instead of butter. I also added some chopped mushrooms, red pepper flakes, garlic powder and Tony Chachere seasoning (I add it to everything). It was everything I expected it to be and it's good as a side or appetizer.

I have used this recipe multiple times, all with the same awesome result!  I do lessen the amount butter called for and also add sauteed bacon, onions and garlic.  I also like this recipe better with a stronger cheese such as sharp cheddar.  Thanks so much!

These were actually pretty good. I did follow a suggestion and use less butter and I'm thinking I shouldn't have. While they were moist, I think they were a little too dense and seemed like they needed more salt. Which the full amount of butter may have provided. All in all it was an easy, tasty recipe :)

The brownies and the spinach were good, but I've never been a fan of onions. I think the next time I will use less and trying sautéing the onions a little first so they are a little more mild tasting.

These are wonderful.  I used Monterey Jack cheese, added 2 cloves
minced garlic, 1c. chopped mushrooms sautéed in the butter with the
onion. Mine were done in 28 min.  Five of us ate half the pan in
one sitting.

I really loved it. it's nice for people who don't like that spinachy spinach taste! since I didn't have mozarella, I added cream cheese and feta, and covered it with cheese chunks that I thought would melt, and they didn't, but evantually turned out great, as those chunks tasted different beside the food! 

I also added saute onions and garlics, and some seasoning.

I really loved it, thanks!

These were just ok. I would make them again to eat at home, but I wouldn't bring them to an event.

Really, really loved this but took the advice of several reviewers and halved the butter. I also used 2 bags of fresh spinach microwaved in the bag and then added it to the onion mixture. And yes, definitely sauté onions and add seasonings to taste. For me, fresh ground pepper, kosher salt and oregano. Husband loves this!

Followed recipe exactly (Didn't have quite enough Mozz. so I added some shredded Gruyere - which would have only made it better) and this was way too bland and dry for me.  Luckily I had made sauteed onions and mushrooms with dinner, and with those on the same bite the spinach was decent.

Delicious! This is a very simple recipe! However, I modified the Recipe a little (I used half of the butter per recommendation of other reviews) and added diced chicken breast, grilled egg plant, and mushrooms.

I made it as directed and it was wonderful.  I put the spinach in the food processor before I cooked it and then drained it in a colander.  Next time I think I will sauté the onions in some of the butter and top with Parmesan before baking.  The name intrigued me and that is the reason I made it.   I will definitely will make this again.  Thank you for sharing.

Recipe is delicious! Mastered it on the first try, but I do agree with one of the other comments... Adding some bacon is definitely something I'm going to do next time. I made this dish as a side for chicken, but if eaten alone as a small meal, adding some bacon is the perfect way to spice it up.

Absolutely delicious!!! The only thing I do differently is to use fresh baby spinach and chop it in the food processor. Then I cook it in the microwave for a few minutes with chopped onion. I only use 1/4 cup butter and I also freeze fresh mozzarella for a little while then chop it in the processor. It makes a big difference. Yum!

Just made these, read some reviews first and made the following alterations:  I used frozen spinach, i sautéed the onion and garlic first and added the squeezed dry spinach at the end.  I also added sautéed mushrooms and bacon and a little parmesan cheese.  These came out wonderful.  Great flavor, nice dense consistency.  Not really like a quiche and thats what i love about them.   I could eat the whole dish but i need to save some for new years day!!!

Fantastic with a few tweaks! I halved the butter, sauteed the onion in a little bacon fat, and substituted feta and gouda for the mozza. Easier and less eggy than quiche- the whole family loved it. I think frozen spinach would be fine too.

This recipe is awesome. I did add fresh mushrooms on my 3rd time of making it. My family asks me to make it all the time now. I will try adding bacon, but I hope the bacon doesn't overpower the favor.

This recipe was tasty but instead of just mozzarella cheese, I did a half a cup of cheddar, which I think made it taste much better.  I do agree with another poster who said there was too much butter.  I would use 1/2 a stick next time.

Awsome. Did it as written. I would definitely reduce the butter. I'll try half next time. Will also do sautéed mushrooms, more onions, more spinach, fresh garlic, no salt, add feta or con queso cheese. Also experimenting with wheat free flour. Might try panko crumbs.

This is a really good, basic recipe that one can improvise and build on. I made a couple of alterations this time around. To cut down on carbs I substituted almond flour for the all purpose flour. As other reviewers suggested I sauteed the onions for a bit with the spinach ahead of time -- also added some mushrooms. For fun I put some of the batter into mini quiche trays and cooked at half time -- yum! Will definitely make this one again.

This was a huge hit, but I must admit to one change. I didn't have any mozzarella so I used Parmesan and we LOVED it!  It's a new staple in my house.  Thanks so much!!

These were great, but next time I'd add bread chunks and a bit more liquid to compensate, as well as broccoli and maybe another green (thinking blanched green beans, peas or kale). Topped with breadcrumbs and this would be perfect. I also found them a little thin for a 9x13 dish so next time I'd either double (or 1.5) or use a smaller dish.

My Husband is so picky and he loved these...I sautéed onion and added a little garlic with two tbs of butter...used 16 oz bag of frozen spinach defrosted and drained...used other two tbs of butter with mixture ( so decreased total butter to four tbs). Great as a quick side dish or appetizer...going to freeze some and think they will reheat in toaster oven nicely after thawed.

Sauteed onion in bacon fat, added chopped fresh spinach and cooked until wilted. Added 1 tsp garlic and used half the butter called for. Could have used less. Good warm or cold. Has such great possibilities as a base for more involved apps also, but so good as is. Next time will try adding feta, sauteed mushrooms. Maybe even some chopped cooked chicken and sundried tomatoes for a really substantial appetizer.

It was a bit too buttery but I loved it anyway. You could add bacon or garlic but found it to be good without it. I used a combination of cheeses which made it very tasty. My husband loved it !

I halved the recipe, but otherwise made it as written. It was quite good warm from the oven, but the leftovers were not good at all. I tried them room temp, and warmed over in the oven. Didn't care for either. I have leftovers very often, so unless I have a lot of company over, I won't make this again.

I read several of the reviews and agree that one whole stick of butter was a bit much.  I ended up using 3/4 of a stick.  To add some flavor, I took about 1-2 Tbs of the butter the recipe called for and used it to sautee the onions and added mushrooms.  It was delicious!!  I served them at a party, and people are still talking about them!

these brownies are excellent.   my daughter found this recipe and now makes them everytime we need to make something for a party.  We've even had brought them by special request.  Next time we will try them with a little feta cheese to put a greek twist to it.  Try these brownies.   You will find yourself making them over and over again!

Absolutely delicious! I halved the recipe as there was only a small group and used 1 pkg of frozen spinach. I too, sauteed the onion in half of the butter and then added the rest to spinach mixture. I subbed a garlic & herb cheese for the mozzarella, added a little dry dill to spinach and sprinkled top with grated parmesean.  Baked it in an 8x8 pan for about 20-25 minutes.  Reminds me very much of the Stoufffer's Spinach Souffle but so much better.  Can't wait to experiment with different cheeses for different menus.  BTW, my roommate sooo doesn't get the name!

The recipe is ridiculously versatile. The first time I made it for a family dinner people thought of a million ways to serve it (at a brunch in muffin tins, on top of crackers as an appetizer, etc). 

I also sauteed the spinach in a little bacon grease instead of boiling and it was truely heavenly!

This was seriously delicious.  My family really liked it tonight so I will definitely make it again.  We ate is as the main course with a tossed salad (vs. appetizer).  I followed other suggestions such as using 1/2 whole wheat flour, using some feta, using less butter, sauteing the onions with garlic and wilting the fresh spinach on the cooked onions. I also added a whole red bell pepper chopped up to the onion mixture (the colour mixture is nice).  I can see how this is a very forgiving and flexible recipe to experiment with.  Thanks!

Phenomenal!  I made it using directions with the exception of using half of the mozzarella and 3/4 stick butter.  I also added swiss and some parm.  my grandkids love this, they are 1 and 4. my husband who thinks vegetables are for rabbits loved it too!

Cooking the onions before hand is a must! I also cut down the butter amount to almost half. Added red pepper flakes for some heat. I used half a teaspoon of garlic sea salt and half a teaspon of regualr salt. It provided a nice balance as I am not a complete fan of salt. I only gave this recipe four stars because it was lacking some flavor. I think it would benefit from some mushrooms and even some shredded chicken!

I would give these 5 stars, but my husband and kids didn't particularly care for them.  Oh well, more for me!  I used light margarine, in the amount called for, 2 pkgs of cooked from frozen chopped spinach, and reduced fat mozzarella cheese.  I went back and read reviews after I popped them in the oven, and decided that garlic and parmesan cheese sounded great, so I sprinkled some garlic powder and parmesan cheese on top after they had been baking for about 10 minutes.  Yum!  They're great warmed up the next day, too!!

This was very good.  I saw where a reviewer used 1/3 c. of feta cheese and where another used
1/2 c. whole wheat flour so I followed suit.  I really love the flavor the feta cheese gives it.
I also chopped up 2 cloves of garlic and put it with the spinach while it steamed.  I agree that this recipes surpasses the spinach bar recipe.  I
almost started making that one and then I remembered it was the spinach brownie recipe that I had not tried yet that I planned to make (i had picked out the recipe the night before).  I would make this one again.

Way too much butter!!! These were very greasy, and this was a lot of work for just an average finished product.

My grandmother hates spinach, but is in love with these.  She takes them to all of her church potluck dinners and she says the ladies ask her for the recipe constantly.  Thank you so much.  The only thing I do differently is I chop the spinach very fine so that there are no 'strings' of spinach in the bite.  Love them!

What a great, unexpected way to use spinach!  Took these to a party and everyone LOVED them and asked for the recipe.  I followed others' recommendations and sauteed the onions with a bit of garlic and the butter before adding everything together - perfect!

After multiple frustrating incidents today (not having enough cheese, not being able to find the right dish, etc), I was wondering if these would be worth the trouble. I made a half recipe following the instructions exactly, and they turned out great. Light and creamy, with a nice golden brown crust around the edges. They have a great salty taste, and the spinach isn't overpowering. Yummy recipe, and worth the trouble!

Smells great and it's tasty. I used frozen spinach and added a pinch of nutmeg (I always put that in with spinach) and black pepper. Will definitely make this easy appetizer again.

We really liked these although my husband insists that we refer to them as "baked spinach" rather than spinach brownies.  Says it grosses him out. haha.  I used reduced-fat cheddar becaused that's what I had on hand and used a little garlic powder and pepper.  I was concerned about how they would taste reheated but had no problem! I used one small box of frozen spinach.

These were a tasty way to eat some greens.  I used swiss chard instead of spinach and parmesan cheese instead of mozzarella (and less of it).  i sauteed the onion with some garlic first. Maybe because of the change in cheese but adding 1tsp of salt was way too much.  They were still good but a tad too salty for my taste.  I would definitely make them again!

These were good, I made several batches for my wedding. Something was missing to give it that 5th star...I added bacon to some of them and it helped a bit, but it still needed a little more oompfh.

Any vegetable recipe that both my toddler and husband devour deserves a 5 star rating!  The first time I made it I didn't have mozzarella on hand so I used extra sharp white cheddar and I think that is my favorite version!  When using mozzarella I serve with a side of marinara sauce for dipping.  So glad a friend turned me on to this recipe!

I made these as is, no changes.  I took them to a friends birthday party and a lady who saw me bring them in, asked me for the recipe.  Before you knew it, several people whom I did not know approached me for the recipe.  Of course I passed it along. They were a huge success.  Thank you.

This is great. I have been making this brownies for some time and everybody loves them. The only thing I change is that I saute my onions and also add lots of garlic. It is great as an appetizer and I can also imagine it is good as a  side dish to the main course like meat. Always get raving reviews on this. Thanks for the recipe.

Loved it.  It was a hit at our bridge group.  I used 1/2 cup butter, and sauted the onion.

I love this recipe but didnt give it five stars because I found that some alterations were needed. I followed the instructions of other reviewers and only used 1/4 cup butter and sauted the onions (along with the spinach instead of boiling it separately). I also used 1% milk, hald whole wheat flour and half white, light mozza and unsalted butter to make it even healthier. It turned out delicious!

Although these are delicious, there is way too much butter in the recipe.  If you make them as stated, butter is all that you taste.  Halving the butter results in a much tastier product.

I am always trying ways to sneak vegetables into our meals. I made this as a quick dinner for a Sunday night. My two year old twins ate it, my husband and my teenage daughter. I kid you not it was gone in 20 minutes!! Yay, thank you.

Delicious! Based on other reviews, I made a few changes to add more flavor and veggies - added chopped garlic, some spices (basil, oregano, a touch of rosemary); and layered the cheeses:  I melted a bit of leftover pimento cheese and stirred that into the egg-butter mixture, crumbled some goat cheese into the spinach, and used cheddar instead of mozzarella. Also substituted 2/3 cup breadcrumbs for the flour and added a cup of chopped artichoke hearts to the mix at the end.  All I can say is YUM!    This is a very flexible and adaptable recipe once you get the idea of it.

I made several revisions to this recipe based on other reviewer's comments, as well as what I had on hand, so please consider this when reading my 3 star review (i.e. 3 stars is not for the recipe as is). I used chard instead of spinach, added bacon, used whole wheat flour instead of white, cut the butter way down to 2tbs, increased the milk to 1 1/4 cup, added a few cloves of minced garlic, Italian seasoning, and pepper, and sauteed the onions before baking. All in all, a good recipe - had a great texture, looked nice, healthy, smells good, etc. However, I probably won't make this again because as another reviewer mentioned, I found it to be a bit bland (even after all of the enhancements). If I were to make it again, I would take the suggestion of increasing the salt or using a saltier/more flavorful cheese like feta instead of mozzarella. EDIT: I came back and added an additional star because my boyfriend liked these a lot.

I use a 16oz bag of frozen spinach, and just barley thaw it in the microwave.  Easy, tasty, forgiving recipe.  Tastes great with anything thrown in, too!

Great recipe - didn't change a thing!  I used 2 ten-ounce packages of frozen spinach, boiled on the stove and drained (although the recipe didn't specify the latter).  I do think I might try swapping out half of the mozz for other cheeses, like cheddar or feta; there's nothing wrong with mozzarella, but it's a little on the bland side.  I'm hoping I can use these to convince my eleven-month-old to eat spinach, but even if we fail on that front, Mom & Dad sure liked them!  Thanks for the recipe!  UPDATE:  eleven-month-old loves them.  Double thanks!

These were great, everyone devoured them.  I did, however, make some changes.  We never have milk in our house so I used rice milk which worked very well.  I also added some garlic powder, pepper, and Italian seasoning.  We're spinach-lovers so I upped the spinach by 50%.  Very good, rich recipe.  Thanks!    Peace...

These are addictive.  not quite sure how I would serve them, but an appetizer situation seems most appropriate.  Probably a good snack to bring to work for potluck things.  I used 11oz box of frozen chopped spinach and thawed.  Did not cook it and it turned out fine.

Delicious--cooked the chopped spinach according to the microwave instructions and removed as much water as possible.  Used cheddar cheese b/c that's all I had on hand--I always use egg beaters, smart balance and skim milk to reduce the fat/calories some.  Loved this quick recipe.  Be sure to spray your pan well.

I used 2 (10oz) packages of frozen spinach, reduced the butter to 1/4 cup, and added a tsp of black pepper.  My husband eats these for breakfast while I prefer them as a light lunch or a healthy-ish after-work snack.  We sprinkle kosher salt on the individual slices before eating, otherwise they are rather bland.

Excellent recipe! I took the advice of others and sauteed the onion before adding it to the mix. I also used two 10 oz packages of frozen chopped spinach,  cut the amount of butter and the amount of cheese in half. They turned out with a great flavor and were a good bit healthier.

Really Really REALLY good.  Made 1/2 what the recipe called for and baked in an 8x8 casserole dish.  Added some garlic powder, pinch of parsley and basil.  SOOOO Good.  Two of us ate the whole thing. I really think if we had made the amount called for it would only serve ~5.  There is no way you're eating just one.

These were pretty good as a side dish.  Didn't like them cold the next day, but reheated just fine.  I refused to use the name because I was afraid to gross everyone out.

I didn't expect these to be so much better and different than your average spinach quiche. But they are wonderful! My kids (preschoolers) loved them, too. I used a 12-oz. bag of frozen spinach and it was perfect. I also followed other reviewers' suggestions and sauteed the onion in about 1/4 cup of butter (and didn't add any of the remaining butter). Definitely a keeper.

I will admit that I was a little dubious to try this recipe. I am SO glad that I did! Yum, just yum, they turned out fantastic! During the last three mins in the oven I tossed some extra cheese on top. It turned out amazing! This is a definite keeper.

Followed the recipe as written except for the reduction of butter to 1/3 cup per the suggestions of other reviewers.  It was delicious and easy.  My veggie phobic teen ate it enthusiastically.

Man, I HATE Spinach! It's absolutely disgusting to me-- but as a newly converted vegetarian, it has so many of the daily nutrients I need! This dish though... oh-my-goodness. Baking it this way pulls out the flavor AND doesn't leave it too mushy (for you consistency-picky eaters out there, like me). I also covered it after 35 minutes and baked for 7 more because I was afriad it was going to be mushy, and it was crunchy!

Update 2/28/2016:  You can half the butter without any detriment to the bars.  I honestly think you could cut down even more on the butter without diminishing the taste.  Very forgiving recipe - add more or less spinach, onion, etc.  I always use fresh spinach.

Update:  Made them again!  Still love them - so does the bf.  I added more spinach then called for.  Next time, I'll use less butter than called for, b/c it makes them greasy.  You could get away with a lot less butter.  Also, save time and decrease dishes to clean by microwaving the fresh spinach in the microwave for 40 seconds, with a teaspoon of water added to it.

I think fresh spinach is clutch to this recipe.
--------------------
Loved them, although my family was not a big fan.  Very flavorful and hold their shape well.  I used 1.5x the amount of spinach and used ~ 3 tablespoons of butter - 1 tbsp to saute the onions and the (added) 2-3 minced garlic cloves, and then added the remaining 2 tbsp of butter in the main mixture; there is NO reason to add more, so this becomes and even healthier dish.  I also added 1 tsp Italian seasoning, which was overkill.  Next time I'll cut back to 1/2 a teaspoon to forestall the overpowering of the oregano.  Will make again.

I used frozen spinach, following the note at the top, and 20 oz. was just too much.  I might as well have just served spinach with a little cheese sprinkled on top, and I even added red bell pepper.

These are FANTASTIC! I made them for a dish to pass, and they were finished off with no leftovers! I'm a college student, and these were easy and impressive.  I used half the butter called for, and they were still perfect.  I made them the day before and chilled them before cutting them, which seemed to help them retain their brownie shape. Thanks! Yum!

I prepared these for a Thanksgiving Appetizer. After reading the reviews, I wanted to lighten the fats (I reduced butter to 1/4 cup) and increase the fiber (I used 1/2 cup all-purpose flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour) without changing the recipe too much.  I sauteed the onion in 1/2 the butter and added 2 TBSP minced garlic. The "brownies" were a hit and the weight watchers in the group appreciated knowing that each 2"x2" square was only 2 points. Yummy.

This turned out really well. I did saute the onions in 1 tbsp butter and then only added another 1/4 cup to the batter. An easy, versatile recipe that I will definitely make again.

Love these!  My two year old gobbled them up.  Good high protein snack.  Next time I'll use a blended cheese, this was too much mozarella for me.  Probably add bacon too like another reviewer suggested.  This would make a good breakfast "bar" with sausage too.

I thought the spinach bars were OK.  Neither the flavor of the onion nor the cheese came through.  I might try again using double the amounts of these ingredients.  My bars were a bit flat; I think I'll try 3 eggs in the future.  Has anyone tried adding marinated artichokes for extra flavor?

Really delicious! The whole batch went in two days, with only me and my bf eating them. For some reason I had to cook mine for a longer time t slightly higher heat to get a golden brown look. And while they were nice and wet, I found the batch a little eggy. For the future, I'll use only half the recommended amt of egg. Overall, absolutely delicious!

What a great recipe! I made the brownies in my muffin pan and ended up with great little appetizers for a baby shower that I attended. (I wish I took pictures to share!) I used frozen chopped spinach (thawed) for this recipe. I didn't see the need to cook it before adding it to the batter to cook again. It turned out delicious!  I like this recipe because it contains many of the ingredients of a crustless quiche but isn't as heavy because it calls for a substantial amount of spinach with lighther ratios of egg and cheese. It was a great, tasty little snack! Thanks for the recipe!

I went healthy on this recipe. I used 5 instead of 8 ounces of cheese, 12 instead of 10 ounces of spinach, skipped the butter, and used whole wheat flour. They came out great, a little "healthy tasting" but still delicious!

This is AWESOME.  I pretty much made this recipe verbatim, just substituted the flour with oat flour (for candida purposes) and added a 1/2 tsp of minced garlic.  Bagged Baby Spinach (in the salad section of your grocer) worked perfectly.  I also halved the recipe, because I was a little afraid of making the recipe's 24 servings for just my fiance and I. :)  Here's the thing: The recipe cooks down tremendously.  It barely covered a 9" pan - I'm not sure how the full recipe could cover a whole baking pan. My fiance and I polished off the "12 serving" half recipe with ease, and will make the full recipe for sure next time (-9" pan will hold it all perfectly).  

UPDATE: This is now a household staple.  We now make the recipe as is, except we use a whole lb of fresh spinach.  Leave all the other measurements alone, including the butter.  The excess of spinach leaves balances out what others refer to as "too much butter."  We also throw 4 oz of garlic/herb feta into the batch with outstanding results.

These are pretty good! But I feel like they could use a little something more. I used skim milk and about 2 tablespoons of butter. Used a bit of black and red pepper along with some garlic salt. I would recommend trying these!

These weren't exactly what I thought that they were going to be but they were still good. I think I was expecting it too be alot of spinach with little other flavor than mozzarella but the spinach almost seemed to me to be a minor player even though I doubled the amount called for in the recipe. Still good though, used at a birthday party and had no left overs!

I wanted to make these vegetarian, but bacon sounded like a good idea.  Veggie bacon products get soggy, so I used spicy vegetarian Italian sausage, browned it with onions and garlic and crushed red pepper (about 1 t), then wilted fresh spinach in the same pan.  I also used half sharp cheddar cheese and all whole wheat flour.  I cooked these for a bit longer than the recipe states and the middle was still slightly uncooked, but they do firm up.  Next time I will use even more spinach and will add some more hot pepper--maybe a fresh jalapeno.  All in all, these were good hot, cold, or warmed up, and I will keep tinkering with them.  If I hadn't added the cheddar, the "sausage," or the hot pepper, they would have been bland.

Great recipe, stupid name! I call them "Lorainne Bars", and I added bacon as suggested by a previous review. Can't help thinking about other quiche recipes to turn into "bars". Mushroom, peppers, I can't wait. I also think it is a perfect Sunday brunch item. Have already passed the recipe on to friends, co-workers, and family who have tried my first batch.

I loved the name and love spinach, but these were not exactly what I had in mind...they were more like a very spinachy quiche and less like a brownie and pretty oily.  I suppose with some adjustments they could be really good, but honestly not worth my trouble...sorry.

Taste, its a 5, but i just couldnt get the toothpick to come out clean everytime i checked it. I finally gave up at 50 min and just took it out. It was a little mushy when i tried to eat it, but the next day it was solid.  I added olives and sundried tomatoes, and also used half ww flour....not sure if any of that changed the texture when cooking.  I'll most likely make this again!

Good overall recipe. I sauteed the onion,  4 small cloves of garlic, a head of broccoli, some red pepper flakes, chili powder, cayenne, and black pepper in a tablespoon of butter, adding a bag of fresh spinach and a diced green pepper after the onions grew soft. I'm a big spice fiend so if you like the heat dump the spice on. After the spinach wilted I dumped the entire pan (liquid and all) into the flour mixture.  For the "crust" part, I exclusively used whole wheat flour and only added 3 tablespoons of butter to use a total amount of 1/4 cup butter as suggested.  I also used nonfat milk. Didn't have any mozzarella, so I substituted it with 3 oz of shredded parmesan and 4 oz of reduced fat cream cheese and baked for 33 minutes. To my absolute surprise it turned out delicious!  This will definitely be repeated!

I added bacon, sauted in some mushrooms & the onion. Then I wilted the spinach (a frozen box & a fresh bag) with this mixture instead of boiling. Other than reducing the amount of butter I followed the recipe fairly closely and they turned out AMAZING! My daughter told me she will only eat spinach cooked like this, she hates it otherwise. It flew off the table!

This makes the perfect savory snack! I kind of like the "blandness" of it. It's simple yet tasty, and has the perfect texture.  I've tried mixing spinach with broccoli and it came out delicious too. It's so easy to change up the recipe with what you have on hand. And if you like a bite, don't cook the onions first! I love the spicy crunch the raw onion adds.

I use low or non fat mozz.  Since spinach is my favorite food, I eat this non stop.  I would not change anything about this recipe!

Darn, another highly rated recipe that just doesn't thrill me. I think this is a fabulous idea, and that the results could be fabulous with some changes, but these brownies are rather bland and unimpressive as written. A different or addtional cheese is definitely called for, as mozzerella adds texture but doesn't do much flavorwise, and I would want to play around with adding more spices & herbs or more flavorful veggies. I know these can be very good, so I appreciate the base recipe to think about. Thanks!

4 stars because it's DELICIOUS after you change a few things!  First, only 1/4 butter is needed.  (You don't miss the rest - it might possibly even work with less.)  Second, use part of the butter to saute the onions, and add some garlic!  I didn't use mozzarella; instead I used 6 oz Mexican cheese mix and 2 oz sharp cheddar, some of which I sprinkled on top.  After all that they turned out REALLY good; everyone loved them!

I made this for lunch yesterday. I really liked them, it was a very unique different idea for a recipe. The reason  I gave it four stars instead of five was that I followed some tips by the other reveiwers instead of the exact recipe. I think with the origanal recipe the spinach would have been a little soggy and the overall recipe not quite as flavorful. I did add garlic and sauteed it before hand with the onion in 2 T butter and then added the spinach to wilt. Did not have to drain it at all. I also cut the butter in half and used 2 T to sautee and added the other 2 to the batter. I also sprinkled the top with parmesean cheese before baking. I think the feta as used by some other reviewers would also be wonderful in these. I have tried them warm, at room temp, and cold right out of the fridge, and reheated in the microwave. I think I like them warmed best.

I did not care for this recipe! it was mushy in the middle, and i cooked it for longer than the recipe stated (and yes i drained and patted my spinach with paper towels before adding them to the mix) what a waste:(

These "brownies" were DELICIOUS, but mine turned out nothing like the pictures posted here...I cooked them longer than the directions said to, but they were still too soft and mushy to eat without a fork.  It was truly like a spinach and cheese quiche.  Wonderful leftover, as well!  I added 1/2 tsp of cayenne for a little extra kick which I highly recommend.  As another reviewer suggested, I sauteed the onions in a few tbls of butter then wilted the spinach and did not use any other butter in this recipe (it is totally unecessary!).  Will definitely be making this again, probably for a brunch!

As a novelty item these are good.  I made them for a St. Patty's Day snack.  Most people that tried them thought they were pretty good.  They disappeared quickly.  I was a little disappointed that you didn't taste the spinach much with two boxes of spinach.

These were like among the adults of the house. The kids were less than enthused but then again they are not fond of quiche and that's basically what it tasted like.

I decided to try this since it had great reviews (even though I'm not a fan of quiche-like things in general).  I really liked it a lot.  I forgot to add bacon (like someone suggested) and my husband said it needed something like bacon or ham.

These were very tasty...and nutritious too.  I served them with tomato soup for dinner...Yum!  I followed the recipe (did not increase or decrease any ingredients based on previous reviews), but added 3 cloves minced garlic (sauteed with the onion first) and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.  I also steamed 10-ounces of fresh spinach, since that is what I had on hand.  TIP: whisk the flour very gradually into the flour to prevent lumps.  I'll definitely be making this again...Thanks!

Made these to go with dinner today, and they were a huge hit! Even those who aren't the biggest spinach fans loved them. I did add a bit of garlic. Will be making again. Thanks for sharing!

These were very good for a single person like me to make. I enjoyed them for a whole week as a grab-and-go type of breakfast/lunch. I did not refrigerate them and they lasted without drying out or molding. I did add orange bell pepper for a sweet crunch. I sprinkled the top with seasoned salt and paprika, as well as added minched garlic and fresh parsley to the batter. I think these would taste better with fresh spinach as opposed to pre-packaged frozen (mine had a semi-kinda freezer burned taste even though the package was new)

I took these to a church function and only got a little piece.  I added a little more cheese than was suggested to use up what I had and it made them more like a quiche.  BUT I got lots of compliments on them at church and they were gone in a flash!!!

I followed the other reviewers suggestions.  I 1/2ed the butter, added garlic, mushrooms, and tomatoes.  That part was good but the flour just ruined it for me.  I couldn't get over the texture.  It was like egg gone wrong.  I think it would be better with more eggs and no flour.  I didn't care for it and neither did anyone at the office.

I had to change this recipe quite a bit due to the ingredients I had on hand. It reminded me a lot of a crustless quiche and had a nice texture. We had it for dinner and then breakfast the next day! I enjoyed this recipe and think it is really versatile. Like other reviewers, I greatly reduced the butter and still thought it was plenty rich.

I don't know when I have been asked for a recipe by so many. I bring this to church on Sunday for the worship team and they love it! I do add some garlic and parmesan and I cook the onions (and garlic). Yummy!

these are the best. You can take them anywhere, and they are def. not crumbly! I have only used fresh spinich. These are so good on road trips, or picnics, you don't need to store them in the fridge.

DELICIOUS! I made these for our Christmas Eve dinner and they were a huge hit. I also reduced the butter by about half and added some red peppers for color. Thanks for a fantastic recipe. We're making them again tonight.

Loved it! I made it in a hurry for some unexpected guests, all with an 11 month old at my ankles, too. This was super easy and wonderfully delicious. I added some garlic to the onions and sauted them, like others suggested. This one is a yummy one!

Great base - needs something to make it interesting though.  I ended up topping them with a spoonful of hummus and piece of roasted red pepper.  I say bacon, feta, tomato...something...would make it a 5 star for sure!

I tried this recipe and followed the directions exactly, and it turned out pretty good.  However, I felt it wasn't salty enough and was lacking something.  It needed more cheese or more salt.  It also tasted very spinach-y, I know it's a spinach recipe but the flavor of spinach overwhelmed all the other flavors rather than mixing harmoniously with them.  I would try this again and add more salt and also try less spinach or substituting the spinach for broccoli.

Ok so we did this the lazy way.  I sauteed the onion and spinach in a little olive oil and then put everything together.  My son accused me of tricking him because he liked it!

Made this tonight and one of the two kids liked it so that is considered a success here. My husband doesn't like onions so I substituted some garlic and did not use enough because it could have used a little more flavor but otherwise, it was a hit! We will definitely make it again.

Very tasty with swiss cheese! I did as another viewer and by passed the cooking of the spinach. However, make a couple chops on the spinach to incorporate more easily.  Thanks for another delicious recipe!

These sounded great - but I was disappointed. I found them to be very bland - maybe more cheese was needed? I won't be making these again, but the concept is great and with some changes I'm sure they'd be really good.

Yum what a great way for spinach! I didn't use onion since we're not fans of it and my husband is allergic, but I added about 2 tbsp of minced garlic. I also only used 1/4 C of butter and they were great, not greasy or dry. Will definately make this over and over again.

This was delicious with added crumbled bacon and extra chopped garlic. I also added a dash of red pepper. The men in my family especially loved it and have requested that I make this for Thanksgiving.

Used a little less butter as recommended and they came out great! Everyone at the party loved them. They are nice and firm and would probably travel really well. Added after second time: used the full amount of butter- man there was wayyyy too much butter. Will definitely use less as in the first time making them. Also- I was running late and put them out before they cooled enough. They don't taste the same piping hot. Take care in planning enough time to have them at room temp.

These are great! BUT!!! It says NOTHING about draining the water you have the spinach in....do you dump it in the recipe with the spinach or do you drain it....I had no idea.I drained some and left some but that was a real dilema for me.
I added granulated garlic and sauteed mushrooms along with alot of parmesan. It was excellent!

This was yummy!  My kids loved it.  I added spices as suggested by others and served it with fruit for lunch.  My kids ate it up!  I think it would be more appetizing if it were called something else though.

These were great!  I cut the margerine in half and sauted a small can of mushrooms with the onions. I loved them and so did my picky husband! Ill be making them again.  It only took 5 min to prepare.

I was a little confused by the recipe as it calls for 10oz of fresh spinach but in the notes it says 2 10oz frozen packages can be subbed.  I used 1 defrosted box of spinach and that was plenty for us.  the flavors go really well together.  I think it tastes best warm although party goers ate it at room temperature and enjoyed it.

YUMM!! I made this recipe yesterday substituting dried chopped onion for regular onion (this is why boyfriends can't be trusted at the grocery store).  However, the recipe still came out great!  I followed the advice given in the reviews and sauteed the spinach and only used 1/2 the amount of butter.  Just like the reviews said, it still came out great - even better cold the next morning.  I finished them at lunch today and am baking the 2nd batch in the oven right now!  

Today I'm trying the recipe in my cupcake pan.  For this, I recommend no mroe than 20min in the oven.

Very good. I added some diced potates, cut the butter in half and added 1 more egg and it tasted wonderful. I should have added bacon as recommended by others.

I go to this recipe constantly. It is so easy and EVERYone asks me for it. My sister in law and I can sit and eat an entire tray so I always have to double it! I use less than 1/2 the butter and do some olive oil, too. The mozzarella is definitely greasy enough!

These were alright. I made them exactly as written, except using a little more than half of the butter called for and they still were pretty greasy. Pretty good flavor, but nothing I'll be making a whole lot.

I scaled it down to 6 servings and used a smaller pan but I guess the pan was still a little large because it turned into kinda a pancake. It was still every bit as awesome as I'm sure it would have been if I had used the original sized recipe. My husband loves it.

I followed this recipe exactly as printed. The flavor was good except it tasted doughy. I will try again with less flour and maybe more egg. Definitely less butter. But thank you for the recipe it has potential for my taste.

I skipped the step where you boil the spinach, just used raw spinach from a bag, and it was excellent.  Admittedly, I don't know what this tastes like if you cook it, so I have no comparison.  The other thing I changed was the amount of butter.  To save fat and calories I halved the amount stated.  The last thing I did different was totally unintentional - I forgot the cheese!! On the bright side I guess I saved even more fat & calories. :)  With all the changes, both intentional and unintentional, I thought these were fabulous!!

I made this according to the recipe, the only thing I added was a little bit of diced artichoke and this turned out like a bland,flat quiche. My friend loved it but my husband and I weren't impressed. If you want to make this add an extra egg, flour, cheese and probably some bacon because it needs flavor.

My family and guests really enjoyed these bars, which I chose to make with a bag of shredded asiago cheese instead of mozzarella.  Like a few others have noted, my only complaint about the recipe is the statement about using two packages of frozen spinach as a replacement for fresh spinach!  That would be entirely too much spinach!  I did opt to use frozen spinach, but only used about a half of one package.  I'll definitely use this recipe again, maybe for a brunch or cocktail party.

i thought these were delicious; bf thought they were "weird".  They are a bit greasy, though, so I would maybe halve or put in 1/3 less butter next time.  Otherwise, very yummy.  I used an 8x8 pan and baked 2x as long.  I also drained the spinach, although I'm not sure about cooking the spinach.  Wonder if it would be just as good with raw spinach?  Thanks for the recipe!

I've made these twice now.  My husband thinks they're amazing.  I use half the butter, and I add parmesan cheese, italian seasonings and garlic powder.  My husband likes them the next day for breakfast.  In fact he just pops them in the toaster!  At first I thought he was going to make a huge mess, but they came out totally perfect!  My 2 year old gobbled them up when they were fresh, but won't eat them as leftovers.  Go figure. :)

These were tasty road-trip snacks! I made them as directed. The only change I'll make next time is to decrease the butter (maybe by half) -- they were a bit greasy. Great idea, though, and would easily lend itself to variations with other veggies -- bell peppers would be good!

Fantastic! This turned out perfectly and I'll make it again. 

I had a couple of modifications: I used chopped frozen spinach and skipped precooking the raw spinach. And I used Monterey Jack Cheese since that's what I had. 

It's easy, yummy and fantastic when it's cold!

Fantastic!!  
The only change I made was I used serveral cheeses instead of just the mozzerella,( but still totalling about the same quantity.(  I used feta, some mozzerella and a chedder/monteray jack mix. Also added parmasean both to the mix and the top.
 It came out terrific and I will be making it again and again!!

Interesting concept- certainly a recipe to build upon.  I added a little extra mozz cheese and some fresh garlic.  Very tasty- good texture- but overall was missing something.  I agree with another reviewer- this screamed bacon!

The cheese selection could improve this quite a bit- maybe swiss or gruyere?

Not a hit at dinner but certainly tasty.

We have made this several times, & I've passed the recipe on. Even my kids love these things. They are addictive. We've tried them with frozen spinach, fresh spinach, different types of cheese & have yet yo dislike these. THNX & YUM!

we really liked this easy recipe.  this could be done with a variety of different ingredients.  My husband suggested adding ham or bacon.  I think I made a similar recipe to this once with zucchini.  Might be good in a sandwhich!

Mmmm! Being a bit health conscious, I added a handful of chopped, fresh parsley for some extra vitamins A & D and also one Tbsp. of ground flaxseed for an omega-3 boost.

Very Good.  The only problem I had was that I didn't make enough!  Everyone thought spinach brownies sounded insane, but then they couldn't get enough.  My kids (even the one who does not like spinach) want this again.

The name of this definitely does not give it justice!!!  Is absolutely wonderful.   Much like a quiche.  Definitely use only 1/4 c. butter though, is plenty.   I also saute'd the onions as we like them that way.  Will definitely make this again and again over the next years.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

I liked these because I LOVE spinach.  Not a big hit with my husband and kids.  It came out with a quiche like texture. I would like to make them a little thinner and change their name.  Spinach Brownies just doesn't sound appealing. If you love spinach give this recipe a try. I liked it.

These were okay but I think they need more of a crust on the bottom. I will probably play around with this recipe.

The cheese in this recipe really makes the dish. The original mozzarella was good but I tried several others and liked the flavor more. This is a great way to use fresh spinach and I add any other additional veggies that are on hand. I also added bacon bits for a heavier dish but you could use any leftover meat, as well. Super easy and great any time of day. Thanks for sharing this recipe. It’s a keeper!

I made these back in June- I had never cooked with spinach before and I found it pretty simple to do actually.  I followed other reviewers' advice and cut the butter in half, using it to sautee/wilt the spinach in first.  These turned out pretty good, still a little greasy and not terribly flavorful in my opinion.  I think I will try adding some sharper flavored cheese, garlic and/or spices (rosemary might be good) to see if that kicks it up a notch or two for me.  Will try again!

Loved this.  I changed the recipe a little because of personal preferences.  I used shredded mozz cheese and cheddar cheese.  Also substituted the 1/2 cup of butter with a 1/4 cup of light tasting virgin olive oil.  I made this for a "potluck" and this appetizer received rave rewiews.  I will make again and again and again.  It was simple and delicious.

I just made this recipe, and it came out very well.  I'm going to be sharing this with someone who hates onion, so I omitted the onion and added a clove of garlic instead.  It's a bit too oily for me, so I think next time I will reduce the butter.  Overall, I think it should be a hit!

I didn't really like these.  Sounded good, but they tasted like something was missing.  Maybe some garlic or more spices?  Also, if you don't have the frozen spinach you can use fresh spinach.  Just use 6 cups for every 10 oz. box.

Wonderful. Slighty crispy and coloful. My 4 year old it, Hubby too.  I used fresh steamed spinach and lots of chopped onion.  I got the 'thumbs up' to make it again.

Outstanding!  Didn't have fresh spinach so I used a 10oz box frozen and squeezed all liquid out.  Added parmesan,feta, garlic powder, and thyme. Baked in 8 x 8 pan for 40mins.

We make it with cheddar cheese and it turns out great.

Very tasty.  Made these for our neighborhood pot-luck and they were gone quickly.  Did use a bit more spinach and sauteed the onion with a little minced garlic.  Did not use all the butter (4T) or milk (3/4C) called for in the original recipe.

This wasn't good.  The only thing I changed a bit was that I used wheat flour instead of regular.  Definately do not do that.  Entire batch went into the trash.

What a fun way to serve spinach!  It was a very unique way for my family and we all enjoyed them.  I was late starting dinner though and had to cut and serve them right out of the oven, so they weren't firm yet.  Next time I will try to plan far enough ahead to cool them first as directed.  I might try adding some parmesean or romano next time to give it a more cheesy flavor, as the mozzarela is very mild.  Thanks for the neat recipe!

Great-tastes like a quiche.  I made a few changes but only to reduce the calories and fat.  I used 1/2 cup fat free half and half and 1/2 cup skim milk and reduced the butter to 2 tablespoons to saute the onions and garlic.  Also, I sprinkled a little shredded italian cheese blend on top before baking.

I used parmesan instead of mozarella since that's all I had.  Like others have mentioned, it is very quiche-like, and I enjoyed it much better the next day.

I left out the onion by accident.  I also used whole wheat flour for extra fiber.  Turned out great!  Will make again!

These were super tasty, but I found when baking that there was far too much liquid in the recipe. I ended up baking for over half an hour longer than the recipe calls for, and still they were soggy. Refrigeration works well to solidify them, but I would have liked them hot and straight from the oven.

I took these to a party, and they were gone within a short period of time; definitely a hit.

I quartered this recipe so it ended up more like a giant spinach pancake but it was very tasty. I added a little chopped garlic and used mexican cheese along with the mozzarella.

I thought these were a little bland.  I used frozen spinach and I squeezed out all the water I could before adding it.  If I made this recipe again I would add sliced mushrooms.

Any recipe that can get my 4 teenage sons to eat spinach,and like it, gets my vote!! Next time, though, I think I will add some crumbled bacon and see what that does.

This was a very good recipe.  I made the mistake of trying to eat boiled spinach (the kind you get out of the freezer section at the grocery)--anyway, it was disgusting, but I didn't want the leftover (plain) spinach to go to waste, so I used it in this recipe.  It was so delicious.  In my opinion, this is the only way to eat cooked spinach.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

These were pretty good, hubby liked them more than I did.  I wish I'd taken other reviewers advice and added some garlic, they were just a little bland. I'll definately make this one again with some adjustments! (I love the bacon idea, thanks!)

The kids loved them!  I thought they were a little too buttery (is that REALLY possible??!??), but none were wasted!

I thought that these were pretty good. I made these for an art critique and not many people wanted to try them but those who did liked them.

I made this for a potluck and *everyone* loved it! I added some tobasco sauce, pepper, and pesto (leftover) to the mix, then put 1/2 cup of cheese on top. A Big Hit!

Good! I took them to a family reunion and they loved them.  The only thing I did to give them a twist was, added mozz. cheese to the top and let it melt and get gooey!!! YUM

I used 10oz of frozen spinach that came with some creamy topping because that's all I had. I used 4 egg whites instead of 2 eggs. They came out really good. Next time I'll try fresh spinach and I'll cut down the butter as others suggested.

I had to use 6 oz. of spinach because that's what I had on hand. It still came out delicious! I look forward to adding the full 10 oz. Like everyone else I halfed the butter, added a smidgeon more salt and used 2% mozzarella cheese. I look forward to making this over and over. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Very Good!!!   But next time I'll eliminate the butter completely, I only used half the amount and it was still too much.  I also used an extra half cup of cheese so maybe that's why they were so oily. Great recipe!!!

Delicious! 
My whole family enjoyed these tasty 'brownies'. I did tweak the recipe and added more cheese. The result was wonderful! It's definetly a keeper.

These tasted great but didn't turn out for me how I expected.  What I ended up with was more like a spinach and cheese casserole than a spinach bar.  I even baked it extra long. We ate it with pizza sauce on top and it was good anyway.  My 17 month old son had 3 helpings.

These are really good!  But they are NOT what I thought they would be.  This is much more like a casserole than like brownies.
