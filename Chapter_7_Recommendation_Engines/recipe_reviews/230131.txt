I thought this was close to a '5', has a nice, light taste, goes well with other dishes that don't overpower it, and has a good look to it.  Seems, though that the sprouts don't get done as well as I'd like at this temp, so maybe next time I'll try it at something like 400 degrees, checking frequently to prevent charring the outer leaves.

I made this with frozen and thawed Brussels sprouts, and that may have been a mistake. I think it would have been better with fresh because these turned out mushy. But the taste was very good, and I want to make again with fresh brussels sprouts.

I made this as a side dish to accompany a surf-and-turf dinner of filet mignon and lobster. Everyone at the table loved it. I will definitely make it again.

One of my favorite recipes for brussel sprouts so far! I left out the garlic bulb step and it saved a lot of time. Instead I used a little garlic powder. I used bacon instead of prosciutto. Just cut and cooked before adding...about 4 slices. Also, I think I used slightly less balsamic than called for. Still, it turned out great. I'll definitely be making this again.

No time to roast the garlic, so I peeled a few cloves and put them in to roast along with everything else and added a sprinkling of garlic powder. I roasted at 400 degrees to brown the sprouts more ( as one reviewer suggested) and roasted until the sprots were they nicely browned. Excellent receipe. Will make again, and want to try the garlic roasting method in the recipe next time.

I must say, this wasn't as good as the reviews led me to believe. I'm pretty sure I followed the recipe closely but no one really cared for the flavor during my Christmas dinner (myself included).  Next time I'll skip the balsamic vinegar completely because that seemed to overpower the dish.

Tasty. To speed the roasting along, I separated the cloves and removed the papery skin but left the first layer of skin on. Cut off the root of each clove and Roasted in foil for 15-20 min with olive oil. They slid out of the skin easily. Perfection. I used 5 strips of maple smoked bacon (not a fan of prosciutto). I cooked the bacon and then cut it up and added per instructions. There was a touch too much juicy for me, I prefer my sprouts toasty so I roasted at 450 for 30 minutes.

Brought a similar dish to large family gathering. It was very popular with everyone, young and old so I am making it again. However this recipe is slightly different. The previous recipe I used did not have prosciutto nor did it have chicken broth. Instead, it used balsamic vinegar with some sugar.

I forgot to take a picture, but it looked beautiful. I followed the recipe to the T. It was amazing. The prosciutto added a nice, light flavor without the grease or heaviness of bacon. The fried cranberries were enough for flavor, but didn’t taste sugary. The roasted garlic was a wonderful touch. No one ingredient overpowered another. It all came together very well.

i would definitely make this again.  Since I was cooking for crowd that included a number of vegetarians, left out the prosciutto (although it would have been good, I'm sure!).  It turned out wonderfully and I received many compliments.  The balsamic vinegar added a nice tang and the roasted garlic enhanced, but did not overwhelm.

Dried, sweetened cranberries ruin this dish.  Why not fresh or frozen cranberries without sugar?

I would put a five stars without the odd way of oven cooking ! I respected all the principles of this recipe which are : olive oil, balsamic, cranberries, garlic and some smoked proteins. That said,  and like others 1) I didn't bother with the roasted garlic but simply added garlic powder. 2) I changed the bacon for chunks of smoked salmon and it was just great and healtier. 3) I simply used a pan to roast  the sprouts in olive oil, than added the rest of the ingredients . The conclusion is : it taked 20 mn cooking instaed of 1h, same taste and no risk of drying.

I love it! Can't wait for family to try it. Had to use frozen sprouts & real bacon bits as that was what I had & watch calories. WILL make this again soon& I am not a brussel sprouts fan but try them for nutrition & variety!

Very good even if you don't love brussel sprouts.  Easy to make. Was a great new side dish for Thanksgiving! thank you! Oh let me add that I did not roast the garlic. I used a garlic paste.

OMG!
I love Brussel Srpouts and this is by far one of the best I've made!
I used some really good Balsamic Vinegar and the roasted garlic was amazing!
