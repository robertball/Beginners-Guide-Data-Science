I'm from Detroit and I've thought this is how most people eat a Coney !  Of course the best 'chili' for them is the bulk 'dehydrated' chili you can get from Sherwood Foods. and lots of diced onion and good mustard like Plochmans .  one can also put on some saurkraut ( if your from the Hamtramck area ! )

Ashley, so many States have a way of making dogs "their own", which I think is so cool. My hubby LOVES his Red Hots, so I'm always looking for new ways to make them for him. Needless to say, the boy was a happy camper when I served him your Detroit recipe. You're so adorable and I can't believe that you've got two little ones! Of course all Ashley's are beautiful as I've got a gorgeous one myself! Thanks so much for sharing!!

Although I've had chili dogs, I did not realize the correct way to serve coney dogs was with mustard, and now I see that that's the only way to go! (Minor correction - I think you meant 4 hot dog buns, not 1.)

I have missed these. I got a stash of sauce from one of the Detroit chains and used that instead of canned. These were a big hit during the Tiger game. Since I no longer eat hot dogs, making these at home with veggie dogs(I know, I know)  is the only way I can enjoy them. Everyone else still has "real" hot dogs and enjoys these here as much as at the restaurant.

Wow, I made this before. I didn't even know there was a recipe for it? If you can find them the hotdogs with the natural casing are the best. I could get them in MI, but haven't been able to find them here in VA. You can also cook the hotdog in the house, which is what I did. I was trying to invent my own quick coney dog and did just that. We also put some of the sauce on some fries with a little cheese and onions like at the coney restaurants. For a more authentic version make one of the recipes for coney sauce on here to top it!

Detroit style Coney sauce has beef heart in it. Also no tomato products, which are a main ingredient in most canned chilis. This is just a chili dog "recipe". But props for using a natural casing dog, and the proper mustard and onion.

As someone from Detroit, I was super excited to try this recepe out. It turned out well. But, it didn't have any special flavor to it and didn't have any flavors that would stand out to make me want to make it again.
