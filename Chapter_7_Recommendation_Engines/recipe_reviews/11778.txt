To all who keep tomato sauce recipes and add sugar. If you add a good healthy pinch of baking soda, you won't need the sugar which I think comes through in the taste. Hope this helps. Dormy.

Almost exactly like mine, with a few exceptions. I add 1 tsp basil and 1 tsp oregano in addition to thyme. I also use a little (about 1/4 - 1/2 c) red wine (it does darken the color, but adds tons to the flavor!). Lastly, I saute the onions & fresh garlic, and then add fresh mushrooms. Saute all until tender and add to the sauce. Let simmer for a few hours and YUUUM!! You can also add 1-2 lbs ground beef, or a mixture of ground beef and italian sausage (very yummy) for a meat sauce! Glad she took the time to write this down tho, bc I never do and sometimes I forget what proportions when I try to share the recipe :). Thanks Phyllis!

Very nice sauce! Added a little sugar to cut the acidity of the tomatoes. Great with the manicotti recipe!

Finally...a delicious and easy marinara sauce!  I only had 45 min. to make the sauce and it still tasted great to me and my family.  I can't wait to try it when it has had a few hours to simmer!

I thought this recipe was missing something. However, I gave it a 5 stars because it was good and my family thought it was excellent. I like how simple it is and the diced tomatoes make it some what chunky. For my taste buds though I am going to add oregano, basil and a pinch of baking soda and whatever else I can think of, in otherwords, I am just going work with it. This recipe has potential, I think maybe it was a little bitter. But again a good base or starter recipe.

I think there must be a typo here in 18 cans of tomato paste...i don't think so.
Maybe 1/8 of can of tomato paste is what you meant to say!
I haven't tried this recipe yet...

Excellent tasting sauce. I sauteed the onion in olive oil first and then added 1/2 cup white wine. The sauce came out delicious. Don't forget a screen cover for the pot!

yummy!! a great way to pep up store bought jar sauce, my husband and I loved it. I made it as the recipe states, and added some of the "fast and friendly turkey meatballs" that I had made previously from this site. Next time I may try it w/o the meatballs and add a few extra spices. Will definitely make again.

Your Momma's Marinara is the first stop on the path to victory! Very good stuff. First try vanilla was awesome, but second try I added a little celery during the slow cooking process and put in some black beans  towards the end for a little protien, tasted awesome.

This is GREAT!!! Italian sausage and ground deer works well too. I saute the onions, garlic, S&P in the grease from the sausage and after Bambi's browned well,. I just do it all in one big pot. I go crazy w/garlic and no one has complained. This is great sauce for everything; try it on meatball heros. Ladle/dump it on heavy and just love life! Cover and let it simmer all day! Thanks for this recipe B'D

Great tasting sauce. I am now using this as the base for all my Italian dishes. I usually double the batch and freeze a portion for another use.

A decent recipe for when you want to clear out some space in your pantry and want to spruce up regular jar sauce. I made this in the slow cooker and it turned out pretty good. Husband & kids enjoyed it though I found the finished marinara a bit sweet even though I used a Roast Garlic jar sauce. Ultimately though, for a recipe that still has a 4-5 hour cooking time, I'll stick with my fresh tomato based sauce which also has 6 other vegetables in it (shhh don't tell the kids!)
