I love this recipe, and make it often.  I use green onions and make my ranch dressing from the envelope of Hidden Valley Ranch which tastes better than the bottled version in my opinion.  Excellent salad.

This was a sure fire hit!!  Even my picky Mom and 3 year old twins ate it!  (All of it.)  Great summer salad and the second time I made it I added snow peas and green pepper.  Thanks Rickie!!

The only thing I changed in this recipe was the addition of snow pea pods instead of the grean peas. It was great, easy, and got lots of compliments. A great cold salad to take to picnics or BBQ's.

I made this for my 4th. of July Cookout, and it was the BOMB (means it was good)!!! I added a few things...grated cheese, cucumber, chopped tomatoes, and dry salad mix. I omitted the ranch-style and used italian instead. Will make plenty more times before the end of summer!!!

I made this with cut up pieces of Spam and it turned out great. Not as good as with shrimp but very satisfying. Excellent recipe.

This was really good. I used whole wheat spaghetti, red bell pepper, frozen cooked shrimp, green onion, and light ranch.

My wife loved this. "Write it down before you forget it." is her highest compliment. Definitely pasting this to my electronic cookbook. I was out of ranch dressing so I had to do it with vinaigrette.  It worked well. Next time I'll try it with the ranch.
