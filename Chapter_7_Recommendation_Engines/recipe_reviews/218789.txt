Martha thank you for this recipe I have made this smiliar rice and sausage. I am of Spanish heritage and there is nothing like this dish I call it my comfort food.the only differrence I make is to add a 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes to give it that kick.and I too serve it with pinto beans refried or charro what a humble meal..again thank you for posting it and taking me back home.By the way I do about half of the tomato sauce and then use diced tomatoes it makes it sooooo good.

I had some leftover green and red bell pepper which I added. I also used the entire 8 oz can of tomato sauce. This was a delicious meal and easy.

Martha's Spanish Rice & Sausage Haiku: "So good so simple! (Added tomatoes and beans; really loved this meal!) I'm always skittish about smooshy rice or crunchy rice preparing it as directed in this recipe so I mixed some already cooked rice in and my only other minor change was adding a chopped tomato from my garden and some black beans since the recipe submitter mentioned serving w/ beans. Truly terrific results!

Delicious fantastic I could have eaten the whole thing myself!! Hubby loved it too and he's fussy. I didn't have the adobo spice so I looked up on allrecipes.com and got a recipe for it! Just made my own very easy and again it turned out GREAT! thanks for the recipe!

I'm Spanish and the rice is quite different but your twist on the dish is really good. It seems inspired by Spanish food but not exactly there but my Spanish grandmother LOVES this dish! good job!

I've made this dish twice so far both times with my own changes to suit what I had on hand but I have no doubt that this dish made just as stated would be delicious. This is a great quick weeknight meal helps to use up items in the pantry and can be made all in one pot... these are all pluses in our house!:) The changes I've made are as follows: Both times I've used a jarred mixture of tomatoes onions & bell peppers that I had canned I've used taco seasoning packets to replace the adobo a can of black beans (rinsed and drained) a tsp of sugar to help enhance the flavors a few squirts of lemon or lime juice and a few sprinkles of cilantro (we're big cilantro fans). Other than that I cook it exactly as stated and just let it simmer on the stove until the rice is tender making sure to add water if needed. Once the rice is just about done I turn off the stove and sprinkle a blend of shredded cheese over the top and just let it melt as the rice mixture thickens up and cools. This is a nice hearty meal and a good way to use up some leftover sausage and other ingredients.

Recipe is delicious as it is. It's perfect if you're limited on ingredients. I will absolutely be making this again soon but adding more that I might have on hand such as rotel or corn or just diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce. This is a great recipe and I can imagine so many different ways to take it up a notch if you're in the mood. Thanks for sharing.

Perfect for a quick week night dinner. I used little smokies and instant white rice and added some left over green bell pepper and jalapeno slices but those were my only changes. I made adobo seasnoning from this site. I did cover the skillet after turning the heat down to low.

Came out great. I added diced green pepper with the onion and garlic and crushed red pepper for some heat. I used hot Italian sausage. Today I am making it with Chorizo.

The sausage makes the difference. use sausage that doesn't cook dry. whole tomatoes cheese and a tblsp sugar wouldn't hurt either.

I have made this dish several times. I've made it exactly to the recipe and every other time I included black beans. Every time my family loved it even my picky 2.5 year old. It's not your typical authentic Dominican or Puerto Rican style rice ( I say that because I think some people think that's how it is) but it's still an excellent dish.

Quite good. It's a little sweet for me but then again most everything is. Next time I'm going to go with the family's recommendation of adding green bell pepper and doubling up on the meat. Also covering while simmering worked well. Overall a good simple quick meal.

This recipe is a keeper. Thank you Martha. I used Holmes Smoked Jalape√±o sausage. After bringing ingredients to a boil I covered it with a tight fitting lid and placed in the oven at 300 degrees for 25 minutes. The rice was perfectly fluffy.

This was OK but it took a lot longer to cook than it said. I probably should have covered it while simmering. I added extra water extra tomato sauce and black beans.

This was a good recipe. Some of my rice was a little crunchy. I added beans a can of tomatoes and I used a packet of sazon seasoning instead of adobo. The flavor was good.

Have made this recipe many times. Love it. I add black beans and usually some chopped peppers otherwise make per instructions. I do often need to add a little more water than what the recipe calls for.

This was so good! Have never heard of Adobo seasoning so I found a recipe on Allrecipes. Pleasantly surprised that I had all of the ingredients for it. Was a little nervous. Had not and would not naturally mix all those seasonings together. Fearful of what the family would think. I did make some adjustments to the rest of the recipe. Didn t have any rice so I substituted 1&1/4 cup seashell noodles. Cut the water to 1 cup but ready to add more if need be. I also added a can of black beans rinsed and drained. The rest was as is without the extra salt and pepper. I got raves at the dinner table. So yummy. Thanks for this!

Started the sausage cooking in the pan first and there was no need for any additional oil for the veggies. Added one diced stalk of celery with the veggies and about a cup of frozen corn. Also added a 10oz can of tomatos with spicy peppers in place of the tomato sauce and it was quite spicy. Took the rice a little longer to cook than expected.

I am giving this 3 stars because my husband liked it. I thought it had WAY too much rice compared to the meat ratio. I added half a can of black beans a can of diced tomatoes and kept the tomato sauce to half. It had good flavor and I made my own adobe seasoning from this web site which I plan to use on other recipes in the future as it is a good somewhat spicey flavor. The rice cooked up fine but was sort of a dry dish. I will not make again sorry.

This rice was exactly what I was looking for to compliment my meal. A few changes: I didn't want as much chorizo so I cut back on that and I had used tomato paste since I was out of the tomato sauce. I did make homemade adobo sauce and I think that is the key to the flavors. The only rice I had was basmati and that made this even better!
