I think my hubby summed these cookies up best: "If I ate one of these with my eyes closed I would guess that it was a sugar cookie that spent a bit too long in the oven." I would have to agree. The chocolate and cinnamon flavors just aren't there. There's too much sugar overall which really overshadows any other flavor that might be in this cookie. If I were to make these again I would use less sugar in the recipe (and completely skip the step of rolling them in sugar before baking) replace some of the flour with cocoa powder and up the cinnamon to 1 1/2-2 tsps. Also rolling the dough into balls and then flattening the cookies before baking made them look somewhat rough. I got a better result with leaving them "unflattened" and baking them 12-14 minutes--this created a nice crinkly topped cookie that looked more appealing. Overall though it's not a bad cookie. The texture is quite pleasant--but the flavor just needs a bit of adjustment.
