I give this recipe a five because I have grown up with something very similar to this one and have always loved it.  Living in Kentucky for many years, I have eaten this hundreds of times except cooked with ham hocks.  This time I didn't have any ham hocks (or other necks or parts on hand) and just added beef bullion instead to my water.  It gives it a 'meaty' flavor without any meat or parts.  I also add lots of chopped garlic (in place of powder) and several tsp. of Mrs. Dash salt-free seasoning.  I also added a can of dark red kidney beans, drained and rinsed, to make a complete meatless main dish with lots of protein and fiber.  I served it with some long grain and wild rice cooked with mushrooms, onion, and peas and called it a meal!  You can play around with this recipe a lot.  It's designed to be versatile, to fit many tastes.

I used 2 ham hocks in place of the turkey tails and 2 large cans of green beans with peeled new potatoes. I let the ham hocks simmer for several hours (about 4) before adding the beans (simmered about 30 minutes). Tasted great but next time I would use less garlic and less pepper.

YUMMY! The only thing I changed was I used bacon ends and pieces to flavor the stock, then cut the pieces up and put them back in with the green beans and potatoes at the end OH AND I used fresh green beans instead of canned so I had to adjust the time. AWESOME!

I have used a similar recipe for years (sans the potatoes). I think I will try that next time.  I also use fresh green beans (can't take the taste of canned) and add chicken broth instead of water. Yum!

Cooking for two:  Substituted a smoked turkey wing and used about 3 cups frozen whole green beans.  DELICIOUS!

This recipe is amazing!  I've cooked it a few times and each time I use ham hocks in place of the turkey tail and it's my dad's favorite..  I will reduce the amount of pepper in the recipe next time simply b/c it gets a little hot for my grandmother and my children.

I have also served this recipe for years, except I use fresh or frozen green beans (2 bags) and 1 pound of skinless smoked sausage cut into coins.  Add water or broth and put all ingredients in the pot at once and cook until the beans are tender. Try it sometime. It's less greasy than ham hocks, but oh so good! And even better warmed up the next day!

Nothing says Sunday like these Green Beans & Potatoes. I didn't have any turkey tails (not even sure where to find them) or hamhocks, so I added country ham and skipped the first 2 hours of cooking. The country ham is quite salty though, so there was no need to add more salt. Also popped in the oven as suggested to crisp up the taters. Thanks.

Be sure to use SMOKED turkey -- that's what gives it the flavor -- otherwise, it will be bland.

Excellent.  I think next time I will make some cornbread and wild rice.  Seems like a dish that would make a great side in the holidays.  Thanks

I think it needed more seasoning. I tasted it as it cooked. And, I ended up adding more pepper, seasoning salt and a tad bit of cayenne pepper, for a smidgen of spiciness. We don't eat pork, and I didn't have any smoked turkey parts. So, I added some chicken bouillon cubes to the water. It tasted good. Also, I used fresh ingredients (potatoes, beans, garlic cloves, onion), since I'm trying to get away from cooking with jarred/canned/processed foods. Overall, it was a good recipe. I'm adding it to my repertoire and look forward to making it again.

In our house, we call these hillbilly green beans.  Only we use vegetarian bakon bits to give it that smoky salty taste.    It cooks down rapidly and the kids finish the entire pot they love it so much.

I actually used fresh green beans.  I thought that it would be better so everything was more firm then very soft.  It was great.

I thought this was a great recipe base, because I made a couple of changes.  I left out the turkey meat.  I  already had meat as a main dish and  wanted the  Red Potatoes and Green Beans as a side dish .   I boiled the red potatoes till almost done,  while sauteing the onions in  3 Tbls. of  Bacon grease. For about 5 mins. on a medium heat, then added the 2 cans (drained)  of green beans.  Then mixed well with onions and cooked about 5 mins. or so, then cut up red potatoes and added to green beans and onions mixed together seasoned with  salt, pepper and garlic powder.  My Husband loved the recipe. Thank you for sharing it with everyone. !!!

Who cooks canned green beans for 30 minutes? yuck. I hate the taste of canned anything anyway so I used fresh. I also was grossed out by "turkey tails " so I used wings. tasted delicious. Added a little butter and parsley at the end and it was so good.

Great recipe! I tweaked it a little by adding a couple chicken bouillon cubes and I used a smoked turkey wing and Yukon gold potatoes. My family loves it!
