Fantastic recipe. Didn't make any changes to the portions at all, they are perfect! Any leftovers are quickly gone. Cooking the onions in the bacon grease works out great. I'm flabbergasted that there is only 4 reviews for this delicious recipe. I've been using this site for years and this is my first review. I couldn't pass up giving this a review.

I’ve made this casserole several times now. My family truly looks forward to dinner when, they hear that this bubbly creamy casserole is what’s cooking! I’ve made it with bacon and have also made it with smokies quartered and sautéed with the onions first. 
Just a thought,  for those who find the pierogies mushy or doughy. I actually place mine on a paper lined cookie sheet and bake them @350 from frozen while I am preparing the onions and bacon. They stay firm and retain a nice texture this way. I just cut the end baking time of the casserole since the pierogies are no longer frozen but, nicely done.

This was an excellent recipe - very tasty, creamy, cheesy,  and satisfying.  I made it for a crowd and there was nothing left in the pan.  I started the bacon in the frying pan first, and when it was about halfway done, added in the mushrooms and onions and cooked it all together, then drained it.  Delicious!

Everyone loved this as a side dish with my ham this Christmas Day.  I keep my side dishes vegetarian, so didn't use the bacon, just sauteed the onions in 2 TBSPs butter.  Only used two medium onions.  Even with my family of big eaters, I think this recipe  serves closer to 10-12 servings.  A definite hit, will make again!

Wow loved this recipe.  I had half as I only had one can of soup.  Used fat and salt reduced cream of mushroom soup.  Will be making again.  Thank you for such a wonderful recipe.

I did make this recipe and substituted a few things as I didn’t have bacon or cream of mushroom. I added chicken and basil Alfredo and threw some fresh asparagus in it. Holy yummy! Topped with Parmesan cheese!

This was a nice, filling meal but a little on the bland side.  I would add a little extra seasoning the next time.

I made this dish the other day. The recipe calls for frozen perogies, but I would boil them first, because the perogies in the finished dish seemed to be a bit raw to my liking. Other than that, great first time.

I took this to a potluck and it disappeared. It was tasty even though the oerogies were a bit mushy. The convenience and taste made up for that. I don't think you can expect this casserole to look like individually cooked perogies.

Flavor was ok, but the perogies were doughy and sticking together almost mushy.  Not a great texture.  I wouldn't make again.

I had leftover perogies from an event and wanted to re-purpose them. The only change I made was add ham (oh the salt!). Salt aside, the consensus was that this was just mediocre.  I have a half a pan left and really not looking forward to eating it again. I still have a couple of pounds of perogies in the freezer so still in search of something to do with them.

We enjoyed this recipe, loved the bacon, onion, mushroom combo on the perogies. I halved the recipe using only two boxes perogies (I used onion perogies) and one can of soup. I would like to tweek recipe in future by subbing out soup for some other sauce. Overall quite good. Topped my portion with sour cream.

Followed the recipe, as is, but I halfed it (it makes a lot) and I made it in a crock pot.  Easy to make and it came out good.  Tried it again with cream of chicken and added some leftover chicken.  I thought it was better that way.  I'm thinking that maybe golden mushroom soup might be better.  Very good as is, but some room for person tweaking.  :)

Barry loved it. Jemma made it but we probably wouldn't make it again.
