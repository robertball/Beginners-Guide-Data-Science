I make jumbo muffins for a local coffee shop and used this recipe last night for the first time.  It seemed like the recipes were all over the map for how many muffins this makes, so I decided to do 1.5x recipe for 12 jumbo muffins (equivalent to 24 regular muffins).  Now that I've made it, I can see what the issue is -- if you desire muffins that are overflowing and mountainous like the featured photo - this recipe will make 12-18 muffins.  If you do one standard scoop as you'd do for cupcakes, you'll get 18-24 muffins.  My 1.5x recipe ended up making 18 jumbo muffins (equivalent to 36 regular sized), and that was with doing two standard-sized scoops (4 tbsp scoop).
I also made the following recipe modifications:  I used sour cream instead of yogurt and soured my milk with a bit of lemon juice.  I also put just a bit of espresso powder in with the dry ingredients to accentuate the chocolate flavor.  I didn't put chocolate chips on top, just put them all in the batter, and actually backed off a bit on the chips.  I baked these at 400 for about 5 minutes, then immediately lowered the temperature to 350 for the remaining time.  The zap of heat at the beginning helps your muffins make nice mountainous tops instead of being flat.  Test for doneness by pressing on the top of a muffin.  If it springs back or does not give resistance - pull!  These will burn if left in too long.

I cut the sugar back by half and I used homemade unsweetened applesauce for half of the yogurt and half of the oil called for in this recipe. I also used mini chocolate chips. Baked at 350*, these muffins were done in a little over 22 minutes. They did take longer to bake because I really filled my muffin tins--my muffins were GINORMOUS. One of THE BEST chocolate muffins we've ever had. Noone could tell that I cut back the sugar or the fat in the recipe. It still tasted luscious.

These were FABULOUS!! I made changes based on personal preferences, but the recipe is good AS IS!! 1. DEFINITELY add 1 tsp salt. 2. I used 1/4 cup STRONG COFFEE (cooled) instead of the milk, intensifies the chocolate flavor, you WILL NOT taste the coffee, I promise! 3. I used Vanilla Greek yogurt, because that's what I had. 4. Baked only for 16 or 17 minutes, and I also ended up with 18 muffins. Thank you so much, this is an EASY, KEEPER RECIPE!!!!

I really like this recipe. With my first batch, it made two dozen regular sized muffins and one dozen mini muffins, and they were all gone within a few days. My second time around I tweaked the recipe a little, using 1/4 tsp mint extract instead of vanilla and mint chocolate chips. Tasty either way, but I am going to try it with a number of different chip combinations because the recipe is so simple, tasty and adaptable.

I was about to try this after seeing the video yesterday, but the measurements and ingredients are different in the recipe here and the video. I'm not sure which is right. Are the reviews for the written recipe or the video. The video calls for sour cream (as opposed to yogurt in the recipe) and no salt, and the amounts of flour and sugar are different. Seems like a major mix-up to me.

I make these all the time!  I love them!p
@Merchant_M  :  you can't give these an accurate rating because you left out the chocolate chips, one of the key ingredients! Of course it wasn't chocolatey enough, you didn't add the chocolate chips!! Shame on you.

First time I made it, I used Mint Chocolate Chips...my husband's friends loved them.  I am now making a batch with Chocolate Chips and substituded the vanilla for homemade Kahlua.  My husband will bring these with him on his hunting trip.  He feels spoiled. (and because of my oven I baked at 395 deg for 14 minutes)

Best Ever. Since I discovered this recipe, I've been making one batch per week. Yes, my husband and I are chocoholics, but that's another story for another time :))). So, based on my experience, I add a tiny bit more milk (like a tablespoon or so) so the batter isn't so stiff that it's hard to get into the muffin cups. I also adjust the time to about 16 or 17 minutes depending on how firm the batter is. And as others have said, a tiny sprinkling of salt will help round out the taste of the chocolate. I've also found that using a higher quality chocolate chip makes all the difference. Happy baking!

I healthified this recipe and the muffins were really good! I used whole wheat flour, halved the sugar, halved the chocolate chips and used dark chocolate, halved the oil amount and used melted butter, added 2 mashed bananas, 1/4 tsp each of coffee and cinnamon. I made mini muffins, got 34 that baked in 15 minutes in a 375 degree oven. My sons and their friends really enjoyed these. I think adding flax or spelt flour would be good as well.

Made these for my picky eater toddler.  I used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1 and 1/2 cups of regular flour to make it a bit healthier. Also, I used 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup Greek yogurt.  I added 1/2 teaspoon of salt too, and used mini chips.  I baked them at 350 degrees and they were still ready after 20 minutes. Recipe made 15 medium muffins. Pretty moist and not too sweet.

These were delicious! They taste more like dessert! I used half wheat and half white flour, half sour cream and half yogurt, and 1 1/2 teaspoon baking soda instead of just 1 teaspoon. The recipe directions never mentioned the vanilla extract, so just whisk that into the wet ingredients. I didn't have any chocolate chips, so the muffins were not quite as sweet. I guess they were more like "dark chocolate muffins". I sprinkled the tops of the muffins with a few rolled oats before they went into the oven. These muffins are moist, delicious, and a crowd pleaser. Thank you, LONESTAR1

These turned out pretty well.  I did not have any chocolate chips, but, had an abundance of Oreo cookies.  So, I smashed up the cookies and used them in the same manner as the chocolate chips.  These were served at a farewell party with chocolate frosting and they were a huge hit.  It is a good foundation recipe that can be manipulated however you like!

I have a business selling muffins and cupcakes. This amazing, scrumptious, chocolate muffin is one of my best sellers! I did make a few changes. I substituted applesauce for the yogurt. I also do not put milk in, instead I put in a mixture of oil, water, and soy milk (and sometimes unsweetened iced tea, instead of the milk). Thank you for an amazing recipe!:)

I guess I did something wrong, because my muffins came out very poor in flavor and with an unappealing spongy texture. Not enough sugar, not enough salt. I won't be trying that again.

These were perfect! I used low fat milk and yogurt in the batter. They looked like I bought them at the bakery. And they were moist and delicious. I will try them next time with peanut butter chips!

YUM!!  I used sour cream instead of yogurt. Replaced 1/2 cup of the all purpose flour with 1/2 cup whole wheat pastry flour.  Added 1/2 tsp salt. Used a scant cup of sugar. Added some extra chocolate chips to the batter and sprinkled my own desired amount of chocolate chips on top prior to baking; 1/4 cup was not enough for me ;)
Filled 16 muffin tins 3/4 full of batter.  Started to smell the aroma about 10 minutes into baking  time. Checked with toothpick after 15 min, left another few minutes (18 total). maybe bake less next time? These are delicious!

I followed the recipe with the exception of using chocolate chips - didn't have any! What a moist, chocolate-y muffin, will definitely be making these often. I did add an eighth of a teaspoon of espresso powder which really doesn't make it mocha tasting, simply amps up the chocolate flavor. Could make a simple vanilla icing for a glaze, or add in coconut and some nuts for extra deliciousness. Did these in mini muffin tins and filling tins halfway, they were done in seven minutes. A keeper recipe!

Made it today for the first time and it was AMAZING! The only reason I gave it 4 stars - I made some changes to make this recipe a little bit healthier. I substituted 1 cup of regular flour with 1/2 cup of whole wheat and 1/2 of oatmeal flour; instead of 1/2 cup oil I added about 1/4 cup sour cream+30 ml cognac+2 tbsp oil. Next time I might use applesauce instead of 1/2 oil, just didn't have any on hand this time. Some people added espresso to enrich the flavor, I added cognac ;) Also I will cut sugar to 2/3 of a cup, 1 cup made my muffins too sweet.

Made it as directed except buttermilk in place of half the yogurt (what I had on hand). Very good. Two helpful notes: I could tell there was no salt, and I'd add a little next time. Also, I got more than the dozen out of this; filling the muffin cups 2/3 full meant a LOT of leftover batter. Be forewarned.

Fast, easy and yummy! Felt like having a muffin at 11pm and googled for recipes, did not regret I chose this. Used only 3/4cup sugar, 3/4cup milk, 3/4cup yoghurt and self raising flour (only had this on hand). I baked them at 190C for 18minutes. Filled 12 muffin cups nicely.  A keeper! Thanks Lonestar!

These were awesome!  Thank you for the recipe.  I read the reviews prior to making them so I followed a few suggestions, but all in all this recipe is a keeper.  I don't know what the reviewer was talking about (about being dry), they were super moist and my daughter said she would like these for her birthday with frosting on top!  The only changes I made was this: 1 cup sugar to 1/2 organic sugar & 1/2 cup brown sugar, used mini-chips in the batter, added salt (3/4 tsp.), used vanilla yogurt (that's all I had), changed 1/2 cup veg oil to 1/4 cup coconut oil & 1/4 cup applesauce (we don't use veg oil & we try to cut the fat content w/applesauce).  I put 4 large chips on each one and followed the advice of baking for 400 degrees for 5 minutes then turning down the oven to 350 degrees for the last 15.  Very minor changes and this recipe went into my book.  My kids kept asking for more; I can't say it enough, they are delicious.

Enjoyed them, but it makes more like 18 than 12.  A little salt added to the batter would set off the sweet much better than without.

I've baked a lot in my life, but this is not something I will ever bake again. They were tasteless and hard. I followed the recipe as it s written.

Followed the recipe exactly as described, the muffins were moist all right, but the was not near enough sugar or salt in the recipe. The texture of the muffin was off too, it was like a dense ball of dough that wasn't cooked all the way through. This may be a good base, but it needs some work.

Delicious.  Light and even kind of flaky,  Fabulous chocolate taste. Made few alterations used sour cream instead of yogurt,, since I was out of yogurt.  I used 1/4 cup strong coffee and 1/4 milk.  Coffee brought forth the chocolate flavor. And added about 1/2 t. salt to dry ingedients, as I rarely made a baked good that doesnt include at least some salt,  Stellar muffins!  And very pretty too!

Very good chocolate muffin recipe.  Very chocolatey, good crumb texture and very moist (I baked at 350 degrees for 18 minutes).  Do not overbake otherwise it will be dry.  It taste better the second day.

These were delicious.  I made some changes as others suggested, but then added some of my own. I reposted naming them Healthier Moist Chocolate Chocolate Chip Muffins.

So unbelievably fluffy! I did substituted the all-purpose flour for amaranth and almond flour, and substituted the sugar with stevia and xilitol, and the vegetable oil with coconut oil, and I kinda forgot the milk, I didn't realized until right now while writing this, I just added a little more yogurt. They will be made often!

I substituted the milk with espresso to bring out the chocolate flavor. Wow. Sooo good! I happened to only have mini chocolate chips on hand, and I really think it helped disperse the chocolate flavor. (The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star was because I didn't follow the original recipe exactly.)

Fantastic. Calmed my chocolate craving and were so quick and easy to make. Moist chocolatey deliciousness. A must try for the chocolate lover.
The recipe made 12 beautiful high-topped muffins.
Still making these, and no changes required. Best Ever. Heres 5 more stars    *****. May 2018.
Just read a review about the video recipe.., just use this recipe and don't change anything if you want them to turn out. Oct 2018. I do change it up once and a while, use brown sugar for half or all the white sugar, it gives an even more rich and fudgie flavour.

The batter was very thick, like cookie dough, so I had to add an extra egg and about half a cup of milk. Once I added the extra ingredients they turned out great!

I followed the recipe using plain Greek yogurt. I also added a teaspoon of salt and a tablespoon of coffee powder. The muffins were very dry and did not have a real chocolatey flavor. I feel I spent a lot of money on ingredients and could have done better with a $2.00 box mix.

I love this muffin! It's so soft and moist! Made about 26 muffins. I added almond flakes for toppings. My husband and both kids love it and they finished most of them. I baked at 180C for 20 mins. It's definitely a keeper! Thanks for sharing ??

I make these as 24 mini muffins, cutting the baking time to 10-11 minutes.  These are by far, the BEST chocolate muffins!  In my B&B, I have tried various recipes and these are a winner!  The muffins even taste better if baked the night before serving the next morning.  I highly recommend them!

These were good, but not great.  I did make some slight modifications: (1) I didn't have an egg so I used 1/4 cup of vegetable oil; (2) instead of the vegetable oil the recipe called for I used butter; (3) I used 2/3 cup yogurt and 1/3 cup light sour cream; (4) based on other reviews I cut the sugar to 3/4 cup.  I didn't think these were very chocolatey though and they definitely weren't sweet.  Not sure that I'd make these again, but thank you for the recipe.

For a first time baker I followed this recipient to the t. It turned out super. My family and friends loved it and I totally intend to stick to this recipient for chocolate chip muffins. Very moist even without heating them next day for a bit in the microwave. The only issue I faced was that the recipient didn't match the video, very surprising as your website iis so good and helpful so found it a little disappointing. Plus I edited the recipe for 6 but I got much more than 6 muffins, luckily I had spare muffin tins to accommodate the next batch. Well done on the recipe though u nailed it!

Pretty good muffin, good chocolate flavor. My family and I liked it but my husband and I agreed it was a bit dry and needs to be more moist. I ended up with 18 muffins and baked for 17-18minutes.

They taste excellent. I used unsweetened apple sauce instead of vegetable oil. I used paper liners for 1/2 the recipe. A lot of the muffin stuck to the paper. The half I sprayed the pan with Pam came out great.

I’ve made these several times now and they come out delicious every time. If you switch out half of the flour for whole wheat, like I did, then they won’t rise as much but still taste great.

So good!! Made for a lab meeting and people were in love!

Changes: 
added 1/2 tsp salt,
substituted 1/2c oil for 1/2 cup applesauce,
baked @ 350 degrees for ~30min,
used vanilla yogurt so added a bit less vanilla than in recipe.

Will be making again soon!!

I made these into MINI muffins instead and they turned out great! When making minis you'll want to make sure to cut the baking time in half. I also added  an extra 2 minutes more for a total of 12 min of baking time. These mini muffins are perfect for someone who isn't looking for a super sweet option. I substituted pain yogurt for low-fat, plain yogurt  and Lactaid 1% (lactose-free milk) instead of regular milk. 

I will be making these MINI muffins agian!

Like others I made my own changes to my own taste. Major changes I made: Didn't use milk, yogurt or vegetable oil. Instead I used 1 cup apple sauce, 1/2 cup melted butter. Side note: if you use salted butter be sure to decrease the amount of salt you put in or leave it out entirely. I also added a TBSP of dark chocolate coco powder. Everything else I kept the same except a secret ingredient. I filled my muffin tins half way with batter then added a healthy dose of chocolate syrup (about 1 TBSP(I used the homemade chocolate syrup on this site by Zen K.)) then filled the the rest of the way with more batter then put a delicious dose of chocolate chips on top. I only suggest doing this if you have the wrappers. (I'm a stickler when it comes to the coco powder I use. I believe you should use the one you like best and that will make or break any recipe.) Baked at the requested 400 degrees for 20 mins and perfect chocolaty muffins.

I just made these and they were great! I didn’t have plain yogurt so I subbed 1/2 C Greek vanilla yogurt and 1/2 C sour cream which worked well enough that I don’t know if I ever need to use the plain yogurt. I ended up with 18 nicely sized muffins. They seemed a little wet when I removed them from the tin but they were cooked through and when they cooled they were nice and soft and moist. I’ll definitely make these again.

I LOVE these muffins. The recipe is so quick and easy, and the muffins themselves are moist and flavorful, without being overwhelming. The chocolate chips on top do tend to burn at the tips just before the muffins finish cooking through, but I think that just comes with the territory.

make sure not to cook to long or they will be dry. Also, you don't have to use muffin papers. Just spray the pan itself and they turn out just fine.

This recipe was AMAZING!!!! I've made this recipe twice and both times I added about 1 1/2 TBS of milk because the batter was a little bit too thick, and I used mini semisweet chocolate chips, but other than that I was perfect and all 8 kids loved them ! Added a pinch of salt. Makes 24 cupcakes.

ALMOST vegan except for the yogurt I used. 
It needed more liquid because I didn’t use eggs. I used flax meal instead of eggs; macadamia milk instead of dairy; chocolate vegan protein powder instead of cocoa powder; dairy free/soy free/ nut free chippers. It turned out nice and moist! The children and hubby was delighted to have chocolate for breakfast!

I had to make a couple changes due to not having the ingredients. Used 2 ripe bananas mashed instead of yogurt and had canned black cherries. No chocolate chips either but the muffins were moist and delicious even without the chips. Also reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup. If I had honey I would have used that instead. This recipe will be a go to now for me.

Made exactly to directions..... they taste like oil, and are not rich and chocolatey, very disappointing.  I should have subbed half the oil with butter, changed the baking soda to salt and baking powder, and used buttermilk and 1 tsp of lemon, instead of yogurt, with an additional 1/4 cup of cocoa powder. Baking Soda needs enough acid to activate it, this recipes does not have an adequate amount of acid for 1 full tsp of Baking Soda to actually work correctly which is part of the large open crumb texture and oily feeling. 1/2 tsp of baking soda needs 1 cup of acid, such as vinegar, buttermilk, or yogurt to activate, with 1 tsp of lemon. Baking Powder on the other hand is half Baking Soda, and requires less to activate because it contains tar tar which is a dry acid that activates the sodium bicarbonate as soon as it gets wet, so subbing the baking powder and salt in would have created a lighter, yet richer, less oily result. I try not to change recipes the first time I make them out of fairness to the author. They just were not rich and flavorful at all, it was sad. As it is, I topped with powdered sugar in an attempt to add flavor and sweetness.

So sad I lost my recipes. l, will try to fix this one.

These were easy to make and are delicious. 
I decreased the sugar to 3/4 c:  1/4 c. white sugar, 1/2 c. coconut sugar and subbed 1/2 c. of whole wheat flour for some of the white flour and they were still moist  and yummy!

My fourteen-year-old son loves to make these muffins. He uses different flavors of yogurt, as we never have plain, and they always taste delicious!! They never last more than a few hours at my house!!

I've made these twice, once in a cupcake pan and once in a muffin pan. I had to add 3 minutes to my baking time when making the muffins, but oh my goodness, the results were scrumptious! I LOVED these!!! My husband gobbled them up. This recipe is a keeper! I plan on making a huge batch of these when I give birth in a few months and need snacks around the house while taking care of the baby. If you plan on making the bigger size muffins, double this recipe because I only got about 8 big muffins and about 20 cupcake size muffins when I made this recipe. Try it, you'll love it!! And it works out that there's only one egg because the first time I made it, I only had one egg on hand!

Made exactly as written and the muffins were very dry.  They also need more sugar and maybe salt?  Will continue looking for a double chocolate muffin recipe that my family loves.

Super easy, always delicious.  I often use bread flour for such baking, however in this recipe, all purpose flour lends to a much smoother, cake like texture.  I do make a change to the chips - use 1/2 semi sweet chocolate and 1/2 dark chocolate chunks .  This change provides a more flavorful, interesting presentation.

I didn't have yogurt so I used low fat sour cream instead. I have used both yogurt and sour cream in this recipe and like it both ways. I always add a little more cocoa to make them really chocolatey - I eyeball it and ended up with about 16 muffins.

I have never used yogurt when baking, I think it tasted good but something was different about it and I believe it was the yogurt.. However, my girls loved it and I will make them again but adding more chocolate chips.

This recipe definitely got the moist texture right!  However, it turned out rather bland for my taste.  It definitely needs salt, and melted chocolate wouldn't be a bad addition to the batter, either.

Since I don't have a special Valentine this year, I made a batch to bring to work for Valentine's Day. I increased the chocolate chips in the batter to 1 cup, which made them even better. I also used half brown sugar and half white sugar, and I got 18 muffins without skimping on the portions. Watched baking time and started checking at 15 minutes, and they were well done at 18 minutes. They came together fast and easy too. Not overly sweet, better yet the second day, even better slightly warmed. I had a dozen very happy Valentines!

These were very good and easy to make!  They were very chocolatey, yet light.  I got 18 muffins out of this (I used a standard sized muffin pan), and mine were done in 15 minutes. Definitely satisfied my chocolate craving!  *Note:  I followed recipe exact, except I had to substitute sour cream for the yogurt as I did not have any yogurt.

This recipe is Amazing!  I think the "secret" ingredient that sets this apart from other muffins is the addition of sour cream (which is what I used as a yogurt substitute).  I'm sure the yogurt would work just as well.  Everyone in my house loved them & they are definitely the preferred muffin around here.

These are addictive and very easy to make. I added an extra 1/4 of the ingredients and it made 2 dozen. To use what I had on hand, I substituted flax for the egg and applesauce for the yogurt (I bet the yogurt would have been more moist though). I also substituted rice bran oil for vegetable oil and half raw cane sugar. I also added a pinch of salt. Next time, I may use coffee as some suggested to enhance the flavor.

Overrated. I followed the directions to a T and was very disappointed in the results. Not that moist and not very flavorful. I will not be making it again, but if you try this, I recommend adding salt and under baking them for more moisture.

These muffins are wonderful! When I got ready to make these I discovered that I didn't have the yogurt I thought I did so I used sour cream. Of course the better quality your ingredients, the better your product will be. I used Ghirardelli cocoa powder which is very deep flavored. I also added some Heath bits (Skor candy bar bits for the Canadians)in the batter and dark chocolate chips on top.  Purely decadent!

Great recipe! I used coffee in place of milk, mini chocolate chips and Greek yogurt. I think it needs a little salt. I noticed it was missing from the recipe. I will add 1/4 to 1/2 t next time. This recipe made 24 mini muffins which were done in 10 minutes and 10 regular muffins that baked for 20 minutes.

I made it and only had to make 2 modifications. I didn't have any plain yogurt so I used sour cream and I used 2 eggs instead of one. The muffins turned out really well! Very moist and very delicious.

Good, light and fluffy, crispy on top. Missing something.  I think I would use coffee next time instead of milk, or add instant coffee to the milk to add a little more depth, and maybe a little brown sugar. Made 12 large muffins.

Followed the recipe and surprised I didn’t like them more. Actually, my family didn’t either. Needs more sugar, it’s just not sweet enough. Makes a very pretty muffin though. If you are not a sweet tooth but love chocolate this is the recipe for you.

Delicious!! This is the second time I made these and they are amazing! The first time they turned out dry , so this time I was careful to follow the instructions completely and not over mix. I hardly mixed at all once the dry mix went in, just enough and no more. Very happy and can’t wait to eat another one. Yum!
PS. I got 12 good size muffins.

This recipe is a keeper! Super moist and delicious and also easy to modify. I followed exactly the recipe when I tried it for the first time. And this second time I made half flour and half oatmeal and I can't tell the difference in taste and texture. It definitely will be added to my recipe compilation. Thank you for sharing this yummy recipe!

I cut the sugar in half as suggested by others and was glad I did.  Unfortunately, I did not have plain yogurt so I subbed sour cream.  I used a mix of espresso chips, caramel bites and chocolate chips.  They worked great as mini muffins - 5 minutes, rotate and then another 5 minutes.

I really love this recipe! works great, easy to make, and tastes excellent! my kids almost ate all the muffins in less than a day. Very chocolatey so if 1/2 cup cocoa is too rich, cut it down to 1/4. it's still really good, but much less of a chocolate punch in the mouth lol.

I hv been just making these again and again. For binging during exams, for baby showers, for festival gifting, just to go with a cup of coffee.
I use an LG convection microwave at 200 deg C for 13 minutes in summers and for 15 minutes in winters.

The yogurt really makes an impact on the taste and made it taste almost like it was sour. I don’t think I’ll be making this recipe any time soon.

I think that the rating should be based on making the recipe as is. I gave this recipe 4 stars because it needs some additional salt and because 1 cup of sugar is too much. I added 1/2 t of salt and cut the salt to 3/4 cup. Also, I think that the cupcakes are too large if you make 12 of them. It is better to make more cupcakes and make them slightly smaller.

I did not personally make these, but my son's daycare did for a Muffins fir Mother's day and it was a hit with both moms and kiddos. They made mini muffin size and I presumed they didn't change anything in the recipe. i believe they helped make them. It was a fun treat for all.

These are delicious! I made a few modifications, using sour cream instead of yogurt (just shy of a full cup) and I reduced the milk to 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup hazelnut coffee. Also added 1 teaspoon of salt into the dry ingredients. Baked at 400° for the first 5 minutes then reduced temp to 350° for the remaining time (approx 15 minutes). Perfect muffins!

These are wonderful muffins.  Since I am gluten free, I used King Arthur Flour Measure for Measure to replace the same amount of AP flour, and they turned out great -- cannot tell the difference in flours.  Moist and flavorful. 
I do agree with other posters regarding salt.  I can tell the difference w/o it and will add some next time.  Other than that minor thing, perfect recipe.  Thanks for sharing.  My family is enjoying them!

These were pretty good. I made them as mini muffins. The taste seemed off just the littlest bit, and I couldn’t figure out what was missing. Figured it out this morning: SALT! This recipe just needs probably 1/4tsp salt.

I changed the  recipe by leaving out the yogurt and egg, adding an extra 1/2 cup of milk, 3/4cup applesauce, and only used half the amount of oil.  

They're amazing!

I just finished making these not but 5 minutes ago. I ate one hot and it was pretty tasty. I subbed a few ingredients and added a bit as well. I didn't have plain yogurt but I had chobani blueberry greek yogurt. I still used a cup (2 personal sized yogurts) I also subbed vegetable oil for virgin coconut oil. I added a little extra vanilla and some chocolate syrup for more flavor. I also added a few pinches of salt to bring out more of the chocolate flavor and cut the sweetness. I ended up with a very thick brownie batter probably due to using greek yogurt instead of regular as it has a lower moisture content. I splashed more milk until it was the right consistency and filled my cups up to the top to get a good bakery style muffin top. This recipe made 16 muffins for me. Definitely would have been more if I'd only filled them 3/4 as the recipe suggests. They came out perfect at 18 minutes. This is definitely a good recipe to build upon!

I didn't think they were bad, but I think they could be improved upon.  They are a little boring and could  be more moist.  I also thought they needed salt.....a pinch.  I noticed it right away with my first bite and salt is in all cake/muffin recipes....so don't know what happened here...But the muffin was flat in flavor. Maybe the sour cream and lemon juice posted by Megan Sargeant would take care of the deficits I experienced. I followed the written recipe and did not bother to watch the video. Good Luck

Did I make the same muffins as everyone else? The batter was dry and the muffins are dry. I think it called for too much flour.

If you have no yogurt, sour cream works great.
The recipe made 7 jumbo muffins. I baked at 400 degrees for 5 minutes, then lowered the temp to 325 to finish off (about 20 minutes).
Tastes great - thanks for the recipe!

Perfect recipe! I made small changes. I used brown sugar instead of regular sugar (personal preference), I also skipped adding yogurt and added coffee instead (for a richer chocolate flavor).
I didn’t have enough chocolate chips to add it to the batter so I just added them on top, also added strawberries on top on some of them. 
Delicious! Absolutely will make again!

I made it again! This time added coconut flakes. Didn’t have chocolate chips so I chopped block 70% dark chocolate!

Lacks a little flavor- thinking it may need some salt. I like the crust it puts on the muffin and I like that they are not overly sweet.

Very very good! I replaced the egg with 1/4 cup of unsweetened applesauce, and the 1 cup of milk with 1 cup of sour cream (14%).

Will definitely make it again!!

The chocolate chips were good, but the batter was flavorless. I did use fat-free sour cream instead of plain yogurt but the muffin had no flavor except what came from the chocolate chips.

Over all good recipe.  I lessened the sugar to 3/4 cup.  I also think a little salt might bring out the flavors a bit.  I will defintily be saving this recipe.

These are always a hit at my house.  I only make 12 muffins and fill the tins clear full because bigger is better in the world of delicious muffins..  I never use a full 1/2 cup of oil...probably closer to 3/8.

Really nice, easy to make. Literally did it in two bowls and one pan.
I did cut down on suger by a third, but that's just  'cus I don't like to sweet. 
Next time I'll try to make them with stevia instead of sugar.

used sour cream instead of yogurt and 3 duck eggs (all of varying sizes and shapes) and they came out wonderful. i did not put the chocolate chips on top but however, woukd recommend doing that to give it the extra oomf.

these are so good. i made them according to the written instructions not the video. i made them in texas muffin size which are big and they took about  25 minutes in the oven. the only change i made was i added blueberry yogurt because it was all i had. it didn't affect thee taste at all. this recipe is a keeper.  they are moist, chocolatey , and airy unlike some other  muffin recipes that are super dense. i can't wait to have another with a nice hot cup of coffee. i imagine that will only intensify the chocolatey goodness.

I followed the recipe exactly, but after baking 20 minutes at 400 degrees the toothpick came out coated, even though they seemed firm and sprung back when touched. I continued baking and checking, and the toothpick continued to come out coated even after an extra 5 minutes. At that point I took them out anyway. They were overdone. The toothpick test doesn’t work well for this recipe. Next time I will just check for firmness with my finger. There WILL be a next time, because even overdone they were pretty good!

I would make it again but next time I will add more sugar and bake a little less.as they were barely sweet and a bit dry.maybe because I used a small muffin tin (is all I have) but I had leftover batter that I put in a small loaf pan wich was not as dry.

Maybe these need a lower baking time...did not seem very moist at all. And need to lower the amount of oil...the bottoms of these were really oily, sort of disgusting.

Made with strawberry yoghurt because I could not find any plain ones. Used unwashed sugar. Was afraid it would taste too sweet, but it came out perfectly balanced. Not chocolatey,  with a muffin texture—not too light and not too heavy either. Perfect for breakfast, merienda or a snack attack.

This recipe makes very good muffins, although I think they are more sweet than they need to be. I will definitely use this recipe again, except with less sugar.

These are almost perfect as written. My four star rating reflects if you make the muffins exactly as directed. They're good but something is missing. Doubling the vanilla, and adding espresso powder added more depth and rounded out the chocolate flavor. With the changes I would give the recipe five stars. On another note, fill up the cups almost full, if you want beautifully domed and slightly cracked tops

This recipe was amazing! I was surprised to see yogurt in it but was very pleased with the outcome. I made the muffins for breakfast and the siblings loved them! 
Don't worry, If you forget or don't have enough chocolate chips, It's not terrible if you don't add the last 1/4 cup at the end. Trust me I forgot to and the siblings didn't even notice!

Followed the recipe as is. Kids loved them. They did not make the full week for school snacks.  I am making them again today but am adding bananas (as I have a bunch to use up). Thanks for sharing.

I love making these, they're simple but delicious and so easy to make! Though my siblings keep on saying it's a little too bitter, I've just added a little more sugar and they say it's fine. I do add mayo instead of yogurt as a substitute because it's easier and it makes them richer in my opinion.

I went ahead and substituted the Yogurt with two whipped egg whites. I whipped them just enough for them to hold soft peaks, then folded in one egg yolk, and mixed it into the batter. Turns out a bit thicker but it makes them light and airy.

These were very good.  I made quite a few changes since so many people recommended them! I used butter instead of oil, less flour, added salt and used baking powder and expresso powder.  I also used a cup of chocolate chips and didn't put any on top. I only had strawberry greek yogurt so I used that. I baked them at 350 degrees for 20 minutes.  Will add them to my recipe book and make them again.

I tried making this recipe and it was super easy. The instructions are well explained and it was easy to follow. 

The finished product is very good. It’s chocolatey and moist. I used semi-sweet chocolate chips and next time I would like to try it with unsweetened dark chocolate chips.

These are delicious- very much like those you find in specialty shops!  Fluffy and decadent but not too sweet.  I filled my muffin cups so these muffins had beautiful tops.

Ok, so there is definitely a problem.  I made this because the rating was good but they did not turn out good at all so I looked closer at the reviews and I have to wonder if all of us are seeing the same amount of flour?  Mine did not turn out seeet at all. I used 2 c flour, 1 c sugar. I started over because honestly I was thinking maybe I accidently used 1 c of cocoa instead of a 1/2 c  because sometimes I'm crazy multi-tasking and do that stuff. But I tasted  the batter and it still was not sweet. It was to late to half the flour so I doubled the sugar.  They were better but I really have to wonder if this recipe has been changed along the way. The video does not show the measure of the ingredients. I'd like to see someone confirm.  So confused.

Made these because I was craving something chocolate. They were delicious!! The only change I had to make was I did not have plain yogurt so I used greek vanilla yogurt. My daughter said they were better than the ones I buy at the store!  I will be making these again.

No changes ( only left off extra sugar on top) and I agree with all that the taste is missing something.. The texture was perfect they baked nice (made muffins large ones but adjusted cooking time) looked beautiful but  even BF we just cant put a finger on what is different... will move on to another..

These are better than Bakery muffins.  I didn’t have plain yogurt so I used vanilla yogurt.  I could make these and sell them they are so good.  I used the 12 cup muffin tins, with paper inserts, put in extra chocolate chips in the batter and also on top.  Make sure you check with a toothpick for doneness, had to leave in the oven a little extra time.

I used carob powder and chips instead of chocolate and needed them to be dairy free so I used my buttermilk substitute (flax milk and ACV) for the yogurt and milk. I also used date sugar instead of white sugar. Made this on a whim with low expectations but they are so good!!!

If I could give this a 10 I would.  Very moist and chocolaty.  I made mine in my Pampered Chef muffin pans.  Since they are dark pans I made them at 375 degrees for 20 minutes.  I was able to make 18 muffins since they are the smaller size. They turned out great!!  If you're in need of chocolate, this is the muffin to make.

Made these muffins and they were excellent.  Very nice presentation, as well.  Filled the cupcake tins 3/4 of the way and was able to squeeze 18 muffins out of this recipe.  When they were cooked they were mounded over the top of the cupcake liners by about 1/2 to 3/4 of an inch.  Perfect.  This recipe is a keeper.

Made with GF flour as my daughter is Celiac.  Used strawberry yogurt as that’s what I had.  As per other reviews, added 1/2 tsp salt.  Cooked at 375, 22 min.  Made 18 reg size muffins.  Had a 24 tray so put a touch of water in the empty tins.  Very very good!!

These are really good muffins. My chocoholic husband loved them!  After reading a bunch of reviews, I too, made some changes.   Added salt and chopped walnuts.  We never have milk on hand but had made a pot of chocolate coffee for breakfast and used that for the liquid.  They cooked up beautifully and taste pretty good too!  They will probably be better once they're cooled, but we couldn't  wait to try them!  I will definitely make them again!

The cupcakes are not as moist as they should be.. but they are PERFECT for breakfast ! because they are kind of dry, they are great with morning coffee. I add half a cup of brown sugar and half a cup of white sugar instead of all white sugar.

It was very good and made a bunch.  Almost 24 large muffins.  I substituted half of the yogurt with sour cream just because that is what  I had on hand.  It actually could have been sweeter in my opinion.  I would make it again but I might try to figure out how to sweeten them more without adding lots of sugar.

With salt, these would be great. I thought it was odd there was no salt in the recipe but decided to try it as written anyway. They definitely need a little salt. However, they were otherwise delicious so I will definitely make them again and add salt. I love that they have yogurt and milk in them, so are a little higher protein than most muffins. I did halve the sugar, just for personal preference.

They are cooling as I type this.  Second time making these muffins first time followed the recipe to a t only thing I changed was sour cream for the yogurt. They were just ok. This last time I added an extra egg,pecans,kept the sour cream,added salt,skipped the baking soda and added 3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder(baking powder puffs,baking soda spreads). Baked at 425 for the first 5 to 6 mins,then lowered to 375 for 15 mins. Got a nice muffin top!!!

I cut the sugar by 1/2, and used cake flour instead of all-purpose flour. My Muffins turned out with a crispy top & was very moist inside. Super chocolaty and yummy. (Oh! I added some dried cranberries as well, the slight sour+sweetness of the chocolate chips are the best combo)

I used melted butter instead of vegetable oil since I didn't have the latter (only had olive oil, but I don't like to use that for baking).  These chocolate muffins are simply amazing. So soft and chocolaty!

I loved this recipe- it turned out great and had a really rich chocolate flavour. Its one of those old fashioned recipes that you should eat with a glass of milk (or coffee) and a book. I added a topping to my muffins: unsweetened coconut, pecan bits, brown sugar and melted butter to hold it all together. It was delicious and looked gorgeous. I'd also like to add that this recipe made 18 large muffins and 12 mini muffins so..... they are off on the quantity, but that's the only quirk. It took me 18 minutes to bake, not 20 as well. Happy eating!

Note:  The above recipe calls for Vanilla but then never mentions it in the instructions.  That may need an edit.

These turned out great!  They were perfectly moist, and not sickly sweet like I expected.  My kids enjoyed them immensely!

I needed to add a bit more "moisture" to get all the flour mixture to mix in so I added a little extra milk.

These were pretty good. I made for our church coffee shop, so I'm sure people will think they're fine.  I agree that the recipe needs to be edited to clarify the yield and improve directions. I don't generally prepare my ingredients ahead of time, so I accidentally left out the vanilla because it was not called for in the directions.  I threw these together kind of last minute, so I used unsweetened applesauce in place of the oil, and I used some Greek yogurt (plain 2%) and some sour cream to make 1 cup.  I also threw in a little chocolate milk because my batter seemed quite thick.  My biggest suggestion is to be sure to grease muffin papers (if used).  These do not come out of the muffin papers very well otherwise.

These muffins were so moist and delicious.The changes I made were instead of 2 cups of all purpose flour, I added 1 and 3/4 cups of all purpose flour and 2/3 cup of unsweetened special dark cocoa powder to give it better flavor. I also added in 2 teaspoons of baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon of salt. I also used 1/4 cup of honey instead of 1 cup of white sugar to make it healthy. And instead of using 1 cup of plain yogurt I used 1 cup of vanilla yogurt. Since I used honey instead of white sugar, I baked the muffins at 375 degrees Fahrenheit instead of 400 degrees Fahrenheit

This was an easy and delicious recipe that everyone in my house enjoyed. The batter seemed thick, but they turned out just lovely.

These were very flavorless. I had to put some jam on them to make them eatable, and even then wasn't a fan. They are nowhere near as moist as they look.

Great recipe!  It came out the same every time!  Muffins had a nice round top.  We changed the type of chips once and realized that the tips of the chips got a little over done. We decided to stick with semi-sweet chips. They also froze very well and stayed moist even after defrosting.

I'm mixed. I cut the sugar in half, and didn't put chocolate chips on top (ran out). They're not super sweet, but you get an extra kick of sweetness each time you eat a chocolate chip, so I don't think the lack of sugar is a problem. They just taste kind of flat. 

I think if i made them again, I'd add in salt and possibly cayenne, something to give them a little 'kick.'

I made these, but noticed an error in the recipe. How can you make muffins without baking powder??? It didn't make any sense, so I used self raising flour and they came out to perfection!! You can also use any yoghurt of your choice. I used mixed berry!

It was really good! It was a little too dry at first so I added some water, almond milk and some salt. I did not expect that to work.

Mine were a bit dry. I made 9 larger muffins and may have baked them a little too long. The flavor was great. I will definitely make them again and cut down the bake time. I also think I will use mini chocolate chips next time.

Love this recipe!  I've made it several times using regular muffin tins and also the jumbo size.  It's my "go-to" recipe now for chocolate muffins!!  Plus, now that I'm making my own yogurt in my Instant Pot, I have another reason to make these!!

baked in glass pan, I used 50% less sugar ( it was not sweet enough, next time I will use the full amount or try applesauce) I substituted sour cream and the texture was not moist. it was crumbly & falling apart. I may add more oil next time around. The search continues for a dark chocolate loaf or muffin recipe which does not use butter

I love this recipe. I've never baked chocolate chocolate chip muffins before.  For the most part I did follow the recipe. I took out the yogurt mostly because I'm not a fan and swapped for Chocolate pudding cups. And after the first batch I cut the cooking time by 5 minutes but that might just be my oven...The whole family loved them so much I'm making more this morning....Oh and I doubled it with no problems.

We made a gluten free version by substituting rice flour for wheat flour and adding 2 tsp xantham gum, 1/4 cup water, and another 1/4 cup milk. We also substituted mini- rolos instead of chocolate chips. We made 12 medium muffins and had enough batter for another 12 mini muffins. Yum! Great with milk.

I'd given up on making chocolate muffins coz they always came out stodgy and dry, but my hubby was craving some so I decided to go for this recipe. They turned out fabulous! Will not be making any other ever again. These are perfect as is, very tasty, very chocolaty and moist!

Used coconut sugar instead of normal sugar, and it was just right. Be aware that if your muffins are smaller, you can use a shorter cooking time. Also, they don't rise so much.

I stuck with the recipe and they turned out beautifully.  Made two batches - one with and one without chocolate chips.  The one with chips got the thumbs up from the birthday kid, but the adults are preferring the unvarnished variety.  Going to try melting the chips first and adding the melty chocolate into the batter and see how that turns out.   Straight out of the oven, the texture is soft and fluffy, but not excessively chocolatey.  They're not as sweet what you'd buy in a store, but I prefer these.  A note about size: this recipe doubled made 30 regular sized muffins (and a small extra) with tiny muffin tops using an approximately quarter cup measure of batter for each - but I wasn't being picky with measuring.  A note about mixing that may help: I mixed the dry ingredients together, whisked them to mix.  Then threw all the liquid ingredients into the bowl of a stand mixer one at a time, and whooshed them around till fluffy looking.  Switched to the flat batter mixing blade, added dry ingredients in at a stir.  Made sure to mix with a spatula after taking the bowl off the stand, so that everything at the very bottom was mixed in thoroughly.   
I wonder how this would taste with some mushed up banana to substitute for the yogurt.  Hmmm...

I made this with what I had on hand. No yogurt so I used sour cream and used mini semi sweet chocolate chips. That was the only differences.
I overbaked mine since I seemed to always poked right in to the chocolate chips so kept thinking it wasn't done, so my muffins were a bit dry. 
The flavor was great though and these looked so pretty when they were done. Will be making these again using yogurt this time but still w/ the mini chips since that's what I like. Will also make sure not to overbake lol.

The recipe was OK. When was done the middle of the muffin was still wet. I might try to remake again but I am just not sure if it is worth my time and ingredients.

These are so yummy, although they did not take that long at all!! I don't usually keep any yogurt in the house, but I used sour cream the first time I made this dish and it turned out even better than when I made it using the yogurt!! Also, cut the sugar back by half and use less oil than recommended.  I would give it five stars, but perfect recipes don't need changes. That being said, 8.767/10 would try again.

It's very chocolate-y and moist but not super sweet like you think it would be.

Added espresso powder and salt. Cut sugar in half. Delicious and plenty sweet. Made 38 mini muffins, cooked in 9 minutes at 400.

These are delicious and surprisingly filling!  I followed the recipe exactly except to add a dash of salt and I used unflavored Greek yogurt instead of regular because that's what I had on hand.  I made 18 large muffins with one batch.  Will definitely make again, and maybe even experiment with modifications to make them more healthy.

I think my search for the perfect chocolate muffin is over. OH SO GOOD. Missed that I was suppose to put some chocolate chips on top at the end, so all ended up inside the mix....what can I say?! LOVE IT

I have made these muffins 3 times and they are the best chocolate muffins I have ever had!  The only change I made was adding a half teaspoon of salt which I think adds to the depth of flavor.

I followed the recipe exactly as written.  They were super moist, super chocolaty, and really good.  I individually wrapped them in saran wrap and put in the freezer.  My kids put them in their lunches.  They are even more moist after freezing.

These muffins live up to their name. They are wonderfully moist and decadent. I used sour cream instead of yogurt and added 1/2 tsp. of salt. I baked them at 375 for 17 minutes. They were a hit and I'll definitely be making them again.

I made this and it was wonderful! I had my doubts if I could make really, really good, moist muffins at home, but these turned out fantastic.  I added a little salt, because I always like to have a little in things I bake.  I also used strawberry yogurt because that's what I had on hand.  I was going to lower the sugar content because of this but forgot...they turned out about the right amount of sweetness, but I think I will try with plain yogurt next time.

Easy to make. I got 12 regular muffins from the written recipe. I did make a couple of substitutions: instead of vanilla, I used kahlua; instead of yogurt, I used sour cream; instead of cow milk, I used hazelnut milk. Like other reviewers suggested, I added 3/4 t. salt. I used 3/4 c. sugar. I also added 1/4 t. cinnamon. I used mini chips and only 1/2 c. in the batter. Then I sprinkled only some mini chips on top of half the muffins before baking. I folllowed one person's suggestion and started them baking at 400 degrees (200 C) for 5 min. and then turned the heat down to 150 C--which was a mistake; it should've been 180 C (350 F). But it worked out fine; muffins just needed a few extra minutes. Ate one while it was still warm, and it seemed a little dry to me, but DH and a neighbor had no complaints. :)

The recipe needs to be rewritten. In the ingrident list it calls for vanilla, but in the procedure part it omitts adding the vanilla. This recipe makes way more than 12 muffins, especially if you fill only 2/3s like it calls for. I filled the cups full and filled 16 muffin cups. The muffins came out tastey and moist, that is the only reason this is getting 4 stars.

Am I the only one that forgot the vanilla extract?! Went back to the recipe and didn't see it listed but it's in the ingredients. Still turned out pretty good and can't wait to add the vanilla next time.

Moist, soft, just right, melted in my mouth. I forgot to buy the yogurt so I only ended up using 1/2 cup, but it was still SUPER GOOD; so Farless if I used the full amount, maybe it's not needed. I don't like stuff like this but I must admit this recipe was flawless.

My only variation were:

I used melted butter just when it's still creamy instead of oil, added nuts with chips on top (if you have allergies don't & always ask if the person is able to eat nuts), cut back on the sugar by maybe 5 tbsp and in order to give the chocolate more life, I used 1 cup of coffee and milk rather than just plain milk.?? Coffee and chocolate best marriage ever

These muffins are delicious, enjoyed by both adults and children.  I've made them several times already.  Twice they were baked for children and both times they were gobbled up almost instantly, no joke.  This last time, I baked them in a mini muffin pan and topped them with mini chocolate chips.  One recipe yielded 44 mini muffins.  Six children, ages 5-11, gobbled all of them up in less than an hour.  The kids loved them either size but prefer mini size maybe because they didn't have to fuss with a cupcake wrapper.  I didn't have plain yogurt once and used low fat sour cream.  Another time I used a combination of low fat sour cream and low fat yogurt, still came out delicious.  This recipe is DEFINITELY a keeper.

Wow! Yummy! Sooo moist and so big! I did not have yogurt and I totally forgot the egg and they were still outstanding. I used ricotta & milk in leiu of the yogurt. I used agave and coconut sugar for the white sugar. So this recipe offers flexibility and still yields a superior product!

I just made these muffins and they are a hit - they look AND taste great!
Had to use half sour cream half yogurt as I ran out of the latter, but they turned out wonderful still. Also cut down the chocolate chip amount to 2/3 cup total.
This recipe is now my go to for double chocolate muffings

I have made this a few times.  My kids love them.  We have added coconut,  or banana puree and always so yummy.  We only bake them for 15-18 min, until you can really smell the chocolate.  I have baked them for 20 and the bottoms burn. Maybe my oven runs hot.  This is now in my recipe book.   Thank you for sharing your recipe.

It is very simple and fast. Tastes very good. I increase the milk to 1 cup. I also use dark chocolate powder and a little bit of regular chocolate powder.  In my oven I bake only for 15 minutes.

Easy and delicious. I also sprinkled some walnut pieces on top and substituted sour cream for the yogurt because that's what I had in the house.  Came out wonderful.

I made it yesterday. Came out very well. Super soft. All loved it. 
I wonder can I make cake with the same batter?

Very good! But NEEDS a dash of SALT. Everything needs a little salt.  I added a little pour of coffee to intensify the chocolate flavor.

Five stars hands down! So moist and full of chocolaty goodness. I used this recipe and changed it from breakfast to dessert. I don't like a whole lot of sweetness, so I used this recipe for as chocolate cupcake, added some chocolate cream cheese frosting, and of course ice cream! Using the suggestions from other reviews, I cut the sugar in half, and used applesauce instead of the yogurt. This recipe is definitely a keeper. I don't know if the muffins are better they next day, they wouldn't stay around long enough for me to find out!

Will definitely make again. Replaced ½ the oil and ½ the yogurt with applesauce. Had to use a mix of milk and semi sweet chips as well as a mix of plain cocoa and special dark when I ran out. Turned out great! Hit with adults and kids.

I didn't watch the video so used the ingredient amounts stated in the text.  Except I substituted the yoghurt for crème fraiche because I'm naughty and like to live on the edge!  I also used dark chocolate rather than chocolate chips, which I get one of my kids to smash up with a rolling pin.  Very entertaining!  These are the best muffins we have ever tasted and I make them as often as possible!!

I used the amount of sugar it called for. I however did not have plain yogurt, but did have sour cream, so used that instead. And they turned out perfect! Kids loved them and so did I.

I made these muffins as written, and they were delicious! I stored them covered on the counter for 3 days and they were still very soft and moist. Not sure if this tip will help anyone, but in case you don't have muffin liners (I didn't), just heavily grease the muffin tin all over, in the cups and on, with spray oil. Also, I used an ice cream scoop to perfectly portion into 12 muffins. Will definitely make this again!

They were really good! I made a few change though. I use almond milk instead of milk, I use iogo strawberry yogurt instead of plain yogurt and I didn't put any chocolate chips at all. We ate them with or without frosting and I made half the batch in ice cream cups (took 25 mins to bake) and the other in normal cups they took 15 mins only to cook. Anyone notice they forgot to put the vanilla in the directions? Anyway the muffins were really good!!!

I read many of the reviews before making this recipe.  I agree that this makes 18 nice sized muffins with beautifully domed tops. I used low fat sour cream instead of yogurt, used buttermilk in place of regular (and added a splash more as the batter was very thick), and used half regular and half dark cocoa powder. I also used a mixture of dark, semi-sweet, and milk chocolate chips. As for baking time and temperature, I baked these for 5 minutes at 400 F and then lowered the oven temperature to 350 F for 12 minutes. These were done in a total of 17 minutes with this method. When I make these again, I will turn the oven temperature down right away and test at 17 minutes. All in all, this is a very tasty recipe!

I replaced the yogurt and milk with 1 1/2 cups sour cream and replced the oil with 1/2 cup softened butter (1 stick). I creamed the butter and sugar first, then added the egg, then added the sour cream and cocoa powder, then the rest of the liquids. The last to go in was the flour. I made mine into a loaf too instead of muffins ?

This recipe was soooo yummy! I only made a couple changes because I didn't have all of the ingredients. I substituted the yogurt with pumpkin and the vegetable oil for butter. Because of the pumpkin substitution I had to add about a tsp of cinnamon to balance the flavors. They turned out soo good and moist!!

I followed the recipe exactly and wasn't impressed. They were ok, but the chocolate flavor could have been deeper, and I found them to be a tad dry. I'll go back to my 2 egg recipe next time.

I've made these muffins several times- love them! They are always a big hit. As far as I can recall, I have never made any significant changes to the recipe- one time I used chopped up Andes mints in place of the chocolate chips, which was super yummy! The recipe is great as is!

I don't understand how people here can rate a recipe that they altered completely, but oh well. I made it per the written ingredients and directions. I tasted the batter before putting it in the paper lined muffin cups and it tasted a bit...bitter? When I put them in the oven they rose nicely and my house filled with an AMAZING chocolate smell. They cooked perfectly in 19 minutes at 400F, I let them cool for 5 minutes and dug in- worth the wait! Next time I would absolutely add a pinch or two of salt, and maybe use half a cup of vanilla yogurt and half a cup of plain instead of all plain, but they're deliciously fluffy and have a nice, subtle chocolate taste (they're not too rich, not "in your face" chocolatey).

Hi~ I made this with 1 cup of 60% chocolate chocolate chips instead of ¾ and baked them at 350F instead of 400F. They came out super moist and not too sweet! Just the way I like it. I'm definitely saving this recipe!!

These are the best chocolate muffins I have ever tasted!  I made the recipe as stated, except I added in 3/4 teaspoon of salt...something definitely would've been missing without it.  UPDATE:  After making this many times already, I decided to try leaving out the cocoa powder and substituted blueberries for the chocolate chips.  Wow - now these are also the BEST blueberry muffins!  My husband doesn't normally like blueberry muffins and he ate 3 of these after work!  Such a versatile recipe... try using peanut butter chips, white chocolate chips, or mint chips in place of the chocolate chips.  So many possibilities - this recipe is a keeper!

These muffins were fabulous! Chocolatey, soft and moist. But they were too sweet (to my family's taste) and need salt. I will probably cut down the sugar and add 1/2 tsp salt next time. Good recipe!

I followed the recipe to the T except I used sour cream instead of yogurt. I also had to add more milk because it was a crumble all combined and not a batter..  they taste okay but they're very dense! The outside has pretty much a shell, It goes crunch when you first bite in. Then it's very dense and chewy rather than a light and fluffy muffin. I don't understand why.. Do I need to sift my dry ingredients?  I'd love this recipe if I could figure out why they turned out the way they did.

Muffins came out great!  I followed the recipe, excpept I added 1/2 tsp of salt.  My family enjoyed them!  I also got 15 muffins out of it instead of 12 (I guess I could have filled them a bit higher, but either way it was fine).

The family loved these muffins! I doubled the recipe, used almond milk and mini chocolate chips ( that's what I had on hand ) and used jumbo muffin pan.  If you have a craving for a very sweet and chocolaty muffin then this is the recipe for you!

Yes, I changed this up too, but it is clearly a superlative recipe and very forgiving for the rest of us to tailor to our tastes. I reduced the sugar and increased the cocoa by 1/4 cup each. I replaced half the oil with unsweetened pear sauce and mixed in a couple teaspoons of instant coffee to bring out the chocolate flavor.  I used 1/2 cup whole wheat as well as part of the flour. I reduced the chips to 1/2 cup and sprinkled some decorating sugar on top before baking. These were just fantastic and my 11 year old stuffed one in his mouth immediately. Next time I might try sneaking in some puréed  veggies just to see how far I can stretch this one.

I've made these many times- and they are perfection! The only additions I make are (per other recommendations) 1 tsp salt and 1 tsp espresso powder. I always add espresso powder to my chocolate recipes as it really makes the flavor pop. These muffins also present really well- who can resist biting in to something covered with mini chocolate chips!

Although I am not a huge chocolate baked goods fan, my husband and kids are.  So, I made these for my kids to eat during a morning flight. My son is a selective eater, so it was imperative that the muffins be taste-tested. Two thumbs up from all!!! Score one for mom :)

With regards to adjustments, I did make a few, to include the order of ingredients and some exchanges. First and foremost, I always use room temperature eggs.  I used sour cream instead of yogurt, since i had none and I find that sour cream makes better breads and muffins anyways. I used applesauce instead of oil, since it is a good way to reduce some of the calories. I used coconut milk instead of regular milk. In each instance, the exchange was 1:1. 

The order of mixing was a little different than I'm used to, so I altered it slightly as well. I mixed all dry ingredients in the larger bowl, and the wet ingredients in separate bowl. I transferred the wet ingredients to the large dry ingredients bowl, mixed to a slightly lumpy consistency, and then added the chocolate chips. I generally use more chips, berries or nuts than a recipe calls for, so I will estimate that I used about a cup. I used paper cups and filled as directed, topping each muffin off with some chocolate chips to appease my kids preferences for chocolate.  As for baking time, I cooked mine for 23 minutes.  

The recipe did produce more batter than the stipulated dozen, so for a small second batch I made Mini-muffins in a greased pan at the sam

Chock full of chocolaty goodness!  I used 1/4 cup less sugar than called for and added a 1/2 tsp salt since all sweets benefit from salt.  These were moist and delicious and mine were done at 18 minutes.

How do I begin? The luscious enveloping aroma that seeped from the stove mere minutes into the baking process could only elude to the chocolatey heaven that awaited my taste buds. Mortals travel for centuries to taste the crumbs of these delicate, moist,  orbs of pleasure. I highly recommend them.

These turned out beautiful and delicious. I subbed sour cream for yogurt and next time I will add a tsp of salt as I think they need it to balance the sweetness and really make them pop!

Good recipe! However, there are a few things I did change and a few things I would change next time. This time, I stayed very close to the recipe, the only changes I made were mixing all the chocolate chips in the batter (none on top), i substited coffee with a little cream for the milk, and I did them in mini loaf pans (it made 3.) They turned out nice, moist but not so dense it felt like I was eating cake. They were quite light in fact. But, next time I will make them (I will definitely be using this recipe again) I will add more sugar and more chocolate chips. Since I didn't think this batch was sweet enough and it was too late to go back and add sugar, I made up a coffee glaze and dipped them in that. They turned out wonderful. (Coffee glaze: 2 tbsp coffee from the pot, 1 tbsp milk, 1 cup +little powdered sugar) **I just made them a second time: this time I almost doubled the sugar, added an extra ½cup chocolate chips, and made them in mini muffin pans. They were AMAZING. They were absolutely perfect, and lasted really well without drying out. I will definitely stick with what I did  this time and make them again.

Fluffy and moist with a crunchy muffin top. So good. I followed the recipe exactly but I did just mix the sugar in with the wet ingredients because I found it weird that it was with the dry ingredients. Wish there was a stronger chocolate flavor but I think that can be remedied by using a darker cocoa powder.

Just the batter.. is magnificent.. " I get to lick the Pooooot! I get to lick the Poooooot!! " * chuckles * I tweaked the recipe of course.. was more generous with the vanilla, and chocolate chunks.. I added unsweetened coconut flakes and went 50/50 real unsalted butter to extra virgin olive oil. I might us a pinch more baking soda next time.. not sure yet... as they are still baking, but I KNOW!!! will be Jawsome.. I used Ghirradelli 60% cacao chalets and some 62% chunks and some lovely Italian cocoa.. a Heaping 1/2 cup, of course.. I also used natural sugar instead of refined... just a pinch more wetness to account for the increment in dry ingredients and POOF!!! It will be Bucklin'!!! Always be generous with chocolate.. And here's a tip.. For folks who say they don't really care fro chocolate?? Toss in a pinch of sweet brandy or dark rum.. They will love it.. People like that dont' possess enough of the right taste buds or enough of the olfactory sensors to enjoy chocolate the way the rest of us do, so you have to give it something to make the cocoa lift and be more aromatic . " Candy Is A Dandy, But Liquor Is Quicker " oooOOOoOoOoOOoOoOooooo they just came out.. oooOoOoOoOoOOooooo Faaaaabulous!

I made these as mini-muffins and they turned out rich, moist and chocolatey. The only exception I made was using apple sauce instead of the oil, which I do for most recipes.  I did have an issue with the baking time, they weren't cooking so I increased the temp to 300 and that did the trick!

It was so easy my 10 year old made it all by herself for her "American Breakfast" English class. All her classmates loved the muffins. She doubled the recipe and cut  around 20%  on sugar (We didn't have enough sugar. I told my daughter american recipes are usually too sweet for our taste so less sugar should be OK, and it was ;-D).  Thanks for sharing

Great recipe, moist enough but still cakey and with just the right sweetness. I had to substitute milk/half &half soured with vinegar (same measurement called for) for the yogurt as I didn't have any at the time. Turned out perfect IMHO. Thanks a bunch!

I followed the recipe not the video. Cut back on the sugar. Used coconut oil instead of vegetable. Added puréed spinach and kale. Also did half sour milk, half yogurt for the total dairy. I baked them in silicone muffin cups. Made 18 total. My kids and I liked them a lot, but we're used to veggie filled baked goods. My daughters friends were not fans, but I bet they would have liked this recipe as written.

I made it the third time, this time I correctly followed the recipe, and re-watched the video before I started. And this time it tasted a lot better than my first & 2nd time. Yummy! My kid, my husband and I loved it!

I could not wait to try these, so I subbed buttermilk for the milk and yogurt, and they were delicious, moist, just sweet enough, and they were moist and delicious hours after I made them. I baked regular size muffins 16 minutes, and they were done. This recipe is just what I was hoping for- an excellent muffin that tastes great long after you bake it. I had two for breakfast, then I had two for dessert after dinner. They are that good.

My was yummy but a bit dry. I would cut the cooking time back to 16-17 minutes next time and immediately remove from pan.

I veganized this recipe using aquafaba instead of eggs and coconut milk instead cow milk/yogurt. Also added 1 tablespoon vinager and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Worked pretty good! These were the BEST vegan muffins I have ever made.

I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of the vegetable oil.  I substituted coconut oil for that, because I love a chocolatey, coconutty muffin.  They turned out super moist and not too sweet at all.  The chocolate flavor really comes through.  My kids helped me every step of the way and gobbled them up!  Next time, I will add nuts and shredded coconut, to really elevate the chocolate experience.

I used dark chocolate chips, dark chocolate cocoa, instead of milk I used evaporated milk, instead of yogurt I used 1/2 cup of sour cream and 1/2 cup of apple sauce, it was a bite of pure deliciousness! My husband said this is the muffin to always have in the house it is outstanding!

I tried this and didn't have yogurt, so looked at the other reviews, used a cup of sour cream and increased the eggs to 2, and didn't have cooking oil, so I used shortening, and they turned out terrible! Dry, not sweet, and none of the chips melted.  I didn't realize those few changes would destroy the recipe.  Bummed.

This recipe is great and extremely easy to make! I only used 2 spoons and a spatula :) The only changes I made were: reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil.  Also I put all of the chocolate chips in the batter, and cooked them for 17 min.  I got 16 regular muffins.  Thanks fo sharing!

Really QUITE GOOD.  I will definitely make this again!  I didn't have yogurt, so I used sour cream instead.  Also, next time I will half the oil and use apple sauce instead.  As long as you spray your muffin tins well, there was no sticking.  I also added a couple pinches of salt.  The muffins passed the "Muffin Monday" taste test by my kiddos!  Better than the Simply Myffins box mix... thanks! This made 34 large mini-muffins.

These are more sweet than chocolatey in my opinion, but still very good. I popped frozen Neufatchel cheese cubes in the middle of some before baking, the bit of salty cream kicks it up, SOOOOO good.

Really enjoyed this recipe. I dont bake much but found that I already had almost all the ingredients in my kitchen, so I gave it a shot. I didn't have any yogurt handy so i replaced it with some creme fraiche. Also, i used almond milk instead of regular milk, and excluded the chocolate chips (not by choice, did not have any).

One thing i should note is that it also did not say when to add the vanilla. I guess any time in the process if fine. But overall, i was pretty satisfied with the results. I will be using this recipe again and who knows i might actually bake more often. Also, im considering throwing in some chia seeds or quinoa.


Thank you LONESTAR1

First off I have to say that the only reason I could figure out why these muffins are rated so high is because most people who gave it 5 stars changed the recipe. I followed the recipe exactly. The flavor came out okay but they were really dry. They definitely were not moist. Very dissapointing.

Thanks Lonestar for posting this great recipe!  I substituted unsweetened iced tea for the milk and these are so good, moist, chocolatey and as many have said, so good the next day.  I will make these often.  They freeze very well too.

Based on other reviews, I made this recipe with sour cream instead of yogurt (I only had flavored yogurt on hand, and figured sour cream would be more faithful to the original flavor) and added just a wee bit more milk to thin out the batter.  Muffins were moist and delicious!  I'm not sure what size muffin tins the original chef is using, but my batch made 19(!) regular size muffins.

I noticed after I made them that no where in the instructions does it say to add the vanilla extract. I made my muffins without it and they still came out great, this is the best recipe that I have come across yet.

I made this for my kids one snowy morning and they loved it! I made it into mini muffins (about 30). I added 1 tsp of salt and changed the yogurt to fage plain greek yogurt for added protein for breakfast. Also I used 1/4 cup of truvia baking blend and 1/2 c unsweetened apple sauce for the whole cup of white sugar. I think next time I'm going to try it with coconut oil. Overall this is very yummy chocolate muffins!

This recipe was pretty good- the tops got a little crispier than I expected no matter how much I shortened baking time, but the inside was moist and lovely. And I actually liked the crisp tops so that wasn't a problem for me.
I did make a couple changes, but I'm basing my review on the basic recipe part. I skipped the vanilla extract and added peppermint extract. I used vanilla coconut milk yogurt instead of plain yogurt, because that's what I had (I substitute that all the time with no problems). And instead of basic muffins, I put a small amount of batter in the bottom of the muffin liner, then put in an oreo cookie, then covered with another scoop of muffin batter. They cooked up perfectly, and are a fun addition to the boxes of baking I sent out this year!

First, the muffins are not chocolatey as i expected and second, not moist enough as the recipe says. I think i should have pre heated the oven to 350 F rather than 400F like i usually do for muffins, the outer part was hard and dry but inside its jut OK and not too moist. Only change i made for the recipe is, i substituted half cup sour cream for yogurt i don't think that would have any thing to do with why they turned out so dry. Overall , i'm disappointed and i'll try some other recipe  next time. I'm glad i made chocolate frosting  for these muffins which was really good!

Used a scant 3/4 cup of sugar, coconut oil instead of vegetable oil, 1/2 cup yogurt and 1/2 cup sour cream, added 1 tsp. of pure vanilla extract and 1/4 tsp. salt. Baked in mini cups for 12 minutes at 350F and they are divine!!!! Would have given 5 stars except for the additions/modifications.

Made these muffins following the recipe. Thought they'd be great because of the reviews. It made a dozen muffins for me and I didn't even cook them as long as the directions said. I ended up taking them out at 13 minutes. The taste was good, but I did not think they were moist or the best chocolate muffins I have ever made. They were ok.

These muffins were amazing, almost cake like. My boyfriend said all they were missing was the frosting! We both really enjoyed them as an indulgent treat. Making them again right now!

Delicious! Not too sweet but just enough chocolate! I made a vegan version but doing 1 cup apple sauce and using almond milk in place of milk and made a flax egg. I also used cacao for the chocolate. This is a wonderful recipe and easily made vegan

I loved these muffins! If you don't have plain yogurt, sour cream is a great sub! I followed the recipe exactly, and they were perfect! I wouldn't change anything.

Loved these muffins.  I followed the recipe exactly.  They rose beautifully.  The insides were very light almost fluffy.  Kid tested and approved!  The only change was that i turned my oven down to 375 degrees at the ten minute mark as i know i have a hot oven.  Saved to my recipe box...a definite keeper!

Made these yesterday - they came out amazing! Definitely the type of thing you make a day before because they taste so much better day the day after baking. Note - I felt like making muffins but didn't have any yogurt or milk. I substituted the yogurt with pureed cottage cheese and the milk with 1/4 cup of coffee and 1/4 cup of mocha coffee creamer. Like I said, amazing!

My kids love these. In an attempt to make them a little healthier, I now use whole wheat flour, 1/2 the sugar, 1/2 the chocolate chips (leaving out the ones set aside for the top), and included 1/2 cup date "paste" to keep the sweetness.  (I boil dried dates and water together, mashing them together like for date squares.). They haven't noticed the changes, so we are happy!

My first trial with this recipe is successful!
I cut back the sugar by half and followed the rest exactly the same. 
They were beautifully swollen and very moist with full of chocolate flavour.
Love the recipe :)

Made these with Sarah Jo's modifications: 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 cup applesauce, 1/4 cup oil, but used 1/2 cup of fat free sour cream since didn't have plain yogurt, also 1 cup chocolate chips - turned out awesome!  Hard to keep the kids from wanting to eat them all.  Used paper cupcake liners, a 12-cupcake silicone pan, and a generous tablespoon full of thick batter to make smallish cupcakes - 350 degrees for 18 minutes in our oven - made 24 and 14 are left.  Will definitely make again.

This is an awesome recipe. The cupcakes are moist and not too sweet. I used a mixture of strawberry and Greek yoghurt and added vanilla into the egg mixture. Best of all it's really easy to make. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Everyone in my house loves these! We make a batch every week now it seems and they never last long. I like to cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and use honey sweetened yogurts and I can't tell a difference so far as sweetness. The magic of these is how they taste even better the second day.

These were very good. I skipped the chocolate chips on top, and they are still plenty rich. Mine came out a little dry - maybe because I used Greek Yogurt (2%)? The batter was very, very thick - almost a dough. I think next time I would use a little more milk to thin the batter and a little more oil to make them moister.  That said, they tasted yummy and my kids are going to love them for breakfast tomorrow!

First of all which one is being rated? The video is completely different from the written one. In the interest of clarity for the readers, I tried the written one. I was looking for a not-too-sweet chocolate muffin type bread recipe that would work in a loaf pan. It is a very dense batter, not overly sweet and if you are looking for that result then you should like this recipe. The chips will add that extra flavor kick. Baked plain it is rather bland and if you are a chocoholic likely unsatisfying. It is moist, almost fudgey unlike a good many chocolate recipes.  I added an egg and 5 oz of dried cherries plumped in 2 T Chambord (you can use what you like to soften them) I baked it in a loaf pan (9 x 5) for 45-50 min. If you have a larger pan all the better. This recipe rises high. Drained Maraschino cherries may be more suitable, or a mix of raisins and nuts (like a Chunky bar).
Using the vegetable oil and yogurt are good ingredients in helping control cholesterol and nutritional content as opposed to the video version. Good baking to you!

I liked this recipe more than most. Probably could have baked the muffins a few less minutes, but they were moist and not dry in the middle. A little crunchy on the outside. I was a bit short on Greek yogurt, but they came out fine. I've been looking for a recipe that duplicates those terrible (but delicious) grocery-store chocolate muffins. This came close.

Disappointing. Followed this as the recipe says (not the one in the video- but wondering if I should have tried that one instead) except for adding 1/4 cup extra of choc chips. Turned out looking lovely and moist but the chocolate taste was still too mild. Why is it so hard to find a recipe that has a really chocolately taste?

Pretty good. Hubby liked 'em. Easy to make, which I always like. :) I used the recipe as printed rather than the video. Perhaps a little salt may have added to the flavor.

This recipe is perfect just the way it is. I was skeptical when I tried the batter and it lacked sweetness. I baked my muffins for about 22 minutes as well. They were very moist and tasty.

This was good but it dried out the next day.  I'll reduce the baking time to 17 to 18 minutes.  I also baked this in a cupcake tin and yielded 12 hefty muffins.  The batter is thick, but it is the right texture for muffins.

Made this according directions but cut in half in case they weren't good- but they were! Did use vanilla yogart cause that was on hand but came out great.   It did make 11 of the regular size muffins.  I read reviews where people used other chips , I am going to try berries next time and see if it works. Can't find a really good blueberry recipe.
Did make with the blueberries, it is now our go to blueberry muffin recipe! the lightest moistest blueberry muffins and I've made and I've tried a lot of recipes.

Loved these muffins! The minute I took them out of the oven my family couldn't wait, they smelled delicious! They are indeed moist (though I had to add a little more milk than the recipe called for). These are comparable to the chocolate chunk brownies from a certain popular coffeehouse chain.They'll be my go-to dessert when I need a chocolate fix.

Excellent muffins! I just made 2 batches (about 18 each batch) and the family devoured the first 12 instantly. I used 1 cup of sour cream instead of yogurt as I didn't have any. I have saved this and will use it again. Thanks!

I really liked this recipe. It's sooo easy. However, I am always in search of making my chocolate cupcakes, cakes or muffins more INTENSELY chocolate. Is there a trick? Something I should be adding? Don't get me wrong, these were good. It was an easy thing to whip up that my three year old can help with and everyone enjoys them. I only had vanilla low fat yogurt and it tasted great. Nice spongy texture and the tops were a bit crisp. I'm happy.

I thought these would be sweeter than what they were.  I was really surprised.  They have a descent chocolaty flavor, but I was just expecting more I guess.  Kids loved them though!

I made this as written except I added 1/2 tsp salt and I used 1/4 cup less sugar. It was just okay.  Maybe the recipe the video uses is better? My kids ate them, but we all agreed we won't be making these again. I had 2 muffins and I felt a little sick afterward. Heavy foods aren't my thing. I'll be sticking to my recipe that calls for oats, applesauce, and greek yogurt. Although the chocolate oat muffin I prefer doesn't fluff up as much it's much easier on the stomach, and it has a better flavor.

I chose this recipe because I had lowfat vanilla yogurt I had to use up.  So this is my spin....I used 1 cup vanilla yogurt and omitted the vanilla extract. I did not have chocolate chips so I used 4 squares of bakers semi sweet chocolate chopped into small pieces.  I added 2 T. of additional cocoa to the 1/2 cup called for.  I added an additional 2 T. milk to the 1/2 cup called for as well.  Per other reviews I did add 1/2 tsp salt as well as adding 1 heaping tsp of instant coffee to my liquid ingredients.  I was careful not to over bake and it came out with a good moist muffin texture. And with the additional cocoa it have a nice chocolate taste.  Will definitely make again.  My hub suggested a frosting or glaze and maybe an addition of nuts...hhhmmmm?

I made these exactly as written and they came out perfect!  I got 18 large beautiful muffins.  I whipped up the wet ingredients really well then stirred the dry ingredients just until incorporated which helped the muffins rise and keep their nice "puffy" shape.

Hmm, I followed the directions exactly, and these weren't good at all! Tasted like it had too much baking soda, but I know I put just 1 teaspoon in, per directions. I'm not sure what the other reviewers did right that I did wrong!

These were awesome. The family ate them up so quickly. I didn't have any yogurt so I used vanilla pudding instead. I made them in muffin top pans for 15 minutes. I would use this recipe again.

Rich chocolate flavor and a cake like texture.  I added some cinnamon and cayenne for a bit more interest

These were really good but I did make a few alterations. I used applesauce for half the yogurt and half the oil. I also added a small package of Hershey's instant chocolate pudding mix. I only used 3/4 cup of sugar and I used about 2 tablespoons less of flour to make up for the pudding.

This recipe made a dozen and a half chocolaty delicious muffins.   This recipe is a keeper.  Next time I will add a little espresso powder to deepen the chocolate flavor even more.

These muffins were fantastic.  I did make some alterations due to my altitude and ingredients on hand.  For the altitude (6500 ft) I added a 1/4 cup of water and decreased the sugar by 2 Tbsp per batch.  For the ingredient issue, I used greek yogurt in place of regular and applesauce in place of the oil.  I also added some chopped strawberries.  The moisture in the berries compensated for the yogurt.  The flavor was amazing.  However, without the oil, they stuck like glue to the muffin papers.  I would recommend spraying the pan if you choose to skip the oil and skip the papers completely. 

These also made more than the 12 muffins it indicates.  I doubled the batch and filled the tins almost full for 24 regular sized muffins and still had enough to make a loaf pan.  

I would recommend these to my friends with the alterations as noted above.  You can change the ingredients up a little and put other fruit or chips to mix it up.  I can't wait to try these with a cream cheese filling...

Great recipe! Made these with my son, we used a convection oven and backed for 15 minutes.  I wondered about the salt, will add it next time. Super easy, and we got more than the dozen, glad I didn't double the recipe as planned!

Just baked this today and it's by far the best batch of muffins I've made so far. I used less yoghurt though - didn't want the muffins to taste too sour.

I made these into mini muffins for my kids without the chocolate chips, and I didn't think the sweetness was quite enough.  So, if you don't have chocolate chips, add a little extra sugar and maybe more cocoa as well.  I'll definitely try it again with some mini chocolate chips.  My kids did eat them, so maybe I really don't need to change anything, but I wanted a little more chocolateyness in it.

Recipe actually made 18 muffins for me. Loved the moistness with the yogurt! Chocolaty and delicious.
