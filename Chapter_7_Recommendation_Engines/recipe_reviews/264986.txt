Easy as can be. I used an 8-inch cast iron skillet. I might recommend you use a 10-inch skillet.

I decreased this to 3 servings and baked it for only 17 minutes with my oven on "speed bake" setting. I also used fat free, lactose free milk instead of whole milk and it came out fine. It was delicious with blueberries on top. I will definitely make this again and again.
