THis soup was unfortunately not liked by anyone in the house. I think , the texture is the problem. Shredded cabbage in the soup tastes strange. I pureed the soup and mixed with equal quantity of cooked yellow lentils with some cumin and cayenne. Added finely chopped fresh parseley as well. My husband just loved it and couldn't believe that I used the cabbage soup as base.

Not at all what I expected.  I did not enjoy this  at all.  It was not very brothy, more like a stew and it had a strange taste.  I sliced my cabbage instead of shredding it so I don't know if that was part of the problem.  It seemed very starchy and more stewlike than soup. I would not make this again.

This hearty cabbage soup is excellent.  I added celery and look forward to trying it again with other vegetables.  Bravo

Great recipe, and as Tracy said, "versatile!"   I added pound of browned lean hamburger, but followed everything else.  DELICIOUS.  I've been asked to make this again, and again!  Thanks, Tracy.

I love all the ingredients by themselves, but this combination didn't make it.  I think if the broth and the 1/2 + 1/2 each had an extra 1/2 cup of liquid, and the potato was a medium one, this might have been more like a soup.  I'll try again using my changes, and possibly add some caraway or anise seed for additional flavor.

I didn't like this at all.. can't figure out what the problem was because I followed the directions to a "T".. the potatoes were shredded but had a bad taste, kind of "boiled" and it smelled bad...

I pretty much made this recipe as written but added more broth.  It is not very appetizing looking, that's for sure, but tasted very good.  If I made it again, I would add some other veggies or something for color and maybe not shred everything.

Wonderful base soup! I dislike thin, "brothy" soups of any kind, but this one's nice and hearty, much better than most cabbage soups. The tiny bit of sugar really brings out the flavors. I sauteed some polish sausage along with the onion, and added some extra veggies. Great for a cold night!

This is a very good soup. I replaced the "vegetable oil" with olive oil and cut the teaspoon of sugar to half a teaspoon. Cabbage is sweet enough without the sugar. But it helps lighten the taste of the half and half. All in all this is one of the healthiest recipes for cabbage soup I've found on this site, despite the half and half and sugar. All the other ingredients are fresh and wholesome. A rarity in these days of "start with on jar of mayonnaise and two cans of creamed soup" cooking.

Delicious! Who would have thought apple and cabbage go so well together? But they do :) We're sometimes vegan, so I might try it some day with soy milk instead of half-and-half.

Well...we made this soup and found that it was a little...overpowered by the Italian seasoning. Also, all of the ingredients have a similar flavor and texture which makes it a little hard to eat. I'd make it again on a cold day, but certainly not more than a once a month meal.

I made some changes based on what I had available and found this soup pleasantly light and tasty.  I used a sweet potatoe in place of white.  I added some diced celery and shredded carrot used heavy cream 1 apple and 1/2 c applesauce and 2 cups of chicken broth.

Even adding more broth and half and half didn't make this soup. It was more like a bizarre cabbage-onion stew.

This was pretty good.  My husband really liked it.  I did use 3 cups broth instead of the 1 1/2 cups called for.  Didn't neccissarily make if more soupy.  I don't mind it was a little think.  We will add some spicy ground sasage next time just for some variety

This one's pretty good, although it is not very soup-like at all but more like a cabbage casserole.  We substituted beef broth for the vegetable and it worked fine.

One caveat - don't make this if you have a cold!
