My family found this salad to be "okay"- perhaps some of it was the difficulty of finding enoki mushrooms and having to substitute.  The worst problem was having no recipe for the salad dressing we are told to use.  The test says "recipe below" but there was nothing, and a search produces no salad dressing recipe by this author or anything even similar.  Perhaps, if the actual dressing was included, this might have had a better rating from my taste testers.

Excellent! I needed a quick salad for dinner that would use mushrooms and a cuke that needed to get eaten. I thought it was a strange combination and so was delighted when this recipe came up. I had to adapt to what was on hand so here is how it went together in my kitchen, although the original recipe would be even better.  I changed to 4-6 ounces of fresh spinach, no tomato,  Â¾ C mushrooms, coarsely chopped, and 12 green olives, halved, sprinkled a generous amount of bacon bits on top (to please hubby), parmesan cheese, and then honey mustard salad dressing. Served 4 generously. This is a keeper.  Thanks for sharing.
