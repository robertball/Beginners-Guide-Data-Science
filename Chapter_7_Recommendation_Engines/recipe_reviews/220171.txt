I added some onion, doubled the garlic, doubled the ginger, and halved the soy sauce.  This pasta dish looked. smelled and tasted delicious!

Loved this recipe, but have to admit, I made a few changes.  Did not add the egg.  Instead of soy sauce, used Bragg's Amino Acid to cut down on sodium.  Added more red pepper flakes (love spicy food).  Green onions would have really been good in this recipe!  Delicious!!!

Another great Kale recipe. I love that is so different from the typical way to cook kale. I used rice noodles because I don't eat wheat. It worked out fine and didn't get mushy. Make sure to use FRESH ginger. It makes the dish.Thank you for adding variety to my over abundance of kale in my garden.

OMG!  I can't believe I made this!  It was probably one of the most delicious recipes I have ever made with some ingredients I have never used!  I am not a good cook, so I am amazed at myself!  I did make a few little changes - I used coconut oil for the vegetable oil (never cooked with coconut oil before). I have never eaten kale before, so that was different for me.  I ran out of soy sauce so added a Pampered Chef product that had soy and sesame in it. I only put in two eggs and no sesame oil. I will make this again and again!

Awful. I was a bit suspicious once they mentioned 'spaghetti' noodles but I quelled my gut instinct and made the whole dish---as described above. I found the flavor off---not at all Asian, and the flavors just didn't match. The sesame oil was too much and there was no umami tying it all together.

Such a quick, easy, relatively healthy, and tasty meal!  We're eating vegan so I subbed silken tofu for the eggs and added onions as others suggested.  Also topped with some sesame seeds (call me fancy pants).  Hubs suggested peanuts so I'll try that next time.

This was quick and easy. I added some onion, and since I don't like soy sauce I subbed in mango chutney.

Yummy! I didn't actually use measurements for any of the ingredients, but the combination was great.

I didn't find this to be to my liking.  It wasn't bad, but I really don't think I'll make it again, although hubby thought it was good.
