This is a wonderful gluten free recipe! It's fun to because you can eat the ingredients as you make it. I loved using the honey! I didn't have the Honey Nut Chex, but the plain Chex, I'd recommend the plain Chex because you don't want it too sweet. You can almost say it's healthy for you! This is a wonderful "6" star recipe - I encourage everyone-gluten free and not gluten free to try this out!

These are easy & tasty. I used chunky peanut butter & didn't add peanuts.

It is a tasty, very sweet cereal treat.  It is easy to make.  I thought it was a bit too sweet and a crumbled too easily.  I probably won't make it again.

These taste pretty good, but they didn't stick together very well.  Maybe I didn't mix the ingredients enough, but if I make them again, I'll either increase the corn syrup/sugar mixture, or use less cereal.  The flavor kind of reminds me of Special K bars!

These dissappeared very quickly! They are great for someone with Celiacs.

Simple and quick to make.  The hubby ate more than one when he got home, always a good sign.  They taste great.

So easy to make and loved them.  I'm always looking for GF deserts and these didn't taste GF either.    I took them to a party (of 20 and 30 yr olds)  and they were a bit hit.

These had a nice sweet and crunchy taste, but were very crumbly. It seemed that they needed more coating or something. I'm not sure I'd make them again.

Awesome! Use regular corn chex so its NOT TOO sweet. Omit peanuts unnecessary. I used a spatula to press chocolate chips on top cause it's easier seriously. Use fresh box the bottom has more broken chex cereal better for bread crumbs.

I really enjoy this recipe! I have tried it lately without using the sugar but the cereal doesn't stick together in bar form and is just kinda a gooey mess, still good though. I was just wondering if you could not use sugar and still have cut-able bars?

Made it as an alternative for birthday treats and the folks at the office LOVED it (even those who were unsure they would like gluten free stuff).
