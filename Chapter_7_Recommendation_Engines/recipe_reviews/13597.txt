really good.  I did add one mashed banana (just because it needed to be used up) and a generous sprinkle of ground ginger.  I baked in muffin tins (large) for approx. 35 minutes at 350.  Will make again.  Next time I may add two sprinkles of ginger.

I only needed to bake for 45mins. Thankfully my sense of smell led me to check it earlier or else it would've burnt & been no good. Toothpick came out clean, turned out wonderful & delicious! I used fresh strong brewed coffee instead of the boiled water. I would definitely make again.

Tastes just like my Nana's bread. She used to use coffee cans to bake with, which worked really well, giving the bread a nice all-around crust. I haven't tried using them yet, but you can bet I will!

This is a great recipe - wonderful taste and wonderful texture!  I made it to serve to our playgroup when both parents and tots came over this fall for an afternoon of apple picking, and I just realized I forgot to review it!  I was looking for a quick-bread that would be a little different than the run of the mill zucchini or pumpkin or banana - and this got rave reviews from everyone!  (I did omit the walnuts because I wasn't sure about the tots being able to chew them well and because of allergy concerns).  I just used a standard loaf pan, but have kept an eye out for the longer-style pan  in second hand shops that Joan wrote about in the recipe's intro.  I'm so glad to have a new way of including dates in our snack-times.  Thanks very much!

Excellent recipe!  Didn't have walnuts, so I substituted pecans.  Great with butter or crean cheese. Didn't last long.  Plan to make it again for our Memorial Day get together.

Tasty and makes a nice solid loaf that doesn't crumble when you cut it.  I went with part whole wheat pastry flour (about 1/3), half brown sugar, an extra tablespoon of butter, and a little more vanilla, in the interests of both better health and taste, all of which worked well.  I'm sure it's quite good as it stands, as well.

Just what I was looking for. So much like the date/nut bread my mother used to make. Also much like a brown bread baked in cans that my niece used to make(and would not share the recipe!) Think I will try it again using part dates and part raisins and bake in the cans. As suggested by another review, I used hot coffee in place of the water and think that was what made this recipe perfect in my book!

This was a good recipe.  I've been looking for a recipe that might duplicate my grandmother's date nut bread.  While hers was a darker bread, this was very moist and delicious.  I got many compliments...and only one tablespoon of butter!

This was not a hit for our family.  We didn't not like it, but we didn't like it either.  No one went out of their way to eat it, so I won't go out of my way to make it again.  Sorry.

Very simple to make. Excellent turnout! I tried the original recipe. The only change was the malted barley flour. I had barley and made it into flour in my Blendtec blender. A winner!

This was a nice bread, not quite as sweet as I would have liked, but had good texture and made a good size loaf.

We love this bread.  Very sweet.  Cooked full hour and it was perfect.  Substituted 1 cup white wheat flour for 1 cup all purpose and then used all purpose for the rest of the flour.

A nice desert bread, but requires a lot more time to cook, I believe I added 20 minutes.
Good taste and texture but makes a very large loaf. I think I would reduce the number of servings to 8 to get a more accurate timing.

SO good and rich-tasting, despite the relatively low fat content.  I made this last Christmas and am getting ready to make it again.  What a treat!

I used to make a date and walnut bread as a child from a recipe handed down from my grand mother. Unfortunately, I lost the recipe. When I saw this, I though I would give it a try as it looked very similar. I'm afraid I didn't enjoy it very much. Too dark for my liking and not very sweet at all. I'm not saying that it's not a good recipe but it definately wasn't what I was looking for!
