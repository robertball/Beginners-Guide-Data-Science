It's a solid soup.  nice and thick and stewey.  The only modification I'd recommend is that contrary to the author's comment, it did need salt to my taste - but to be on the safe side you can always add that upon  serving.  all in all a tasty soup with minimal effort and a good use for that ham bone.

Great base recipe! I threw all my veggies in together but cut them in big chunks. I used regular potatoes, onions, cabbage, and kohlrabi.I also added some garlic, bay leaf, and Italian seasonind. Delicious. I didn't bother with skimming the froth off the top since I always make my soup a day in advance for more flavor. I just skim off the hardened fat the next day. Great with homemade bread for a hearty dinner

i dont usually make recipes with no reviews.. so thought i would write one.. i didnt have a ham bone so used some leftover ham my mom had given me.. wasnt sure what to do with it so i made this. i definitely needed salt and lots of pepper. other than that i used the same veggies (only i used 5 regular potatoes cubed) and really enjoyed this soup, as did my two small children

This recipe is wonderful, however, I did add some chopped cabbage & rutabaga to the soup & it really upped the flavor.

I had put a bag of dried chickpeas in the crockpot then decided to find a recipe for them.... I tried this one because I had left over ham which I threw in with half a cut up onion. I decided at the last minute to not use any of the vegetables listed. This is wonderful not all doctored up! The broth was salty enough with the ham. Can be a soup or a side.

The broth is delicious and very flavorful. Next time I will use Great Northern beans.

This soup was a hit with my whole family! We did not put the corn, but did add a Visalia onion. Also, we like spice, so I added some salt because the beans were bland. Other additional spices, 2Tbsp chili powder, 1Tbsp Double Barrel Seasoning, 1Tbsp garlic powder and 2Tbsp parsley just before serving. YUM!!!

The type of ham used affects the salt issue. Real Southern or "Country" hams are much saltier than the supermarket variety. I made this soup with a Tennessee ham and it needed no additional salt.

It seemed to be missing something.  Maybe I should have put in cabbage like some others recommended.  And it definitely needed salt, in my opinion.  I doubt I'll try this one again.

Amazing! We are huge garbanzo fans, so this seemed like a good bet. Didn't have a ham bone, but found some smoked pork neck and used that instead. Added some spinach for green, but otherwise followed recipe exactly, and very glad I did. The whole family loved it!
