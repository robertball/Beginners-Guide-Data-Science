This tastes almost like the sauce that I mix up for shrimp cocktails, but this has brown sugar and my cocktail sauce has fresh lemon juice.  Word of caution...you may want to start with half the amount of cayenne, and then add more if you feel it's  necessary.  That's a real blast of cayenne (1-1/2 tsp), and it may be too spicy.  I started with half the amount indicated in the recipe, it had plenty of kick for us, and  we typically like spicy food.

I wanted to love this but I couldn't because it seemed like nothing more than a spicy cocktail sauce. I thought the brown sugar would lend something and I would be surprised with but I wasn't.  It doesn't taste bad but its like a shrimp cocktail. Sorry

The guys loved this, though, hubby's first words after trying it were, "Hey, this tastes like the stuff that you eat w/ fish", lol! I thought the flavors were really good, and I'd eat it w/ fries OR fish! Thanks for sharing. :)

This one is a hit. I changed it a bit and didn't add the horseradish. Some of the reviews compared the dip to shrimp/cocktail sauce. I think not adding the spicy horseradish made all the difference. My family loves it.

Why is cocktail sauce a spicy dip for sweet potato fries?  I could not get past thinking I should be eating fish!?  Not bad as a fish sauce but it totally ruined my fries.

If you like a spicy ketchup dip for most of what you put ketchup on, this is the one. And it's quite good! That's said, add just a bit of cayenne pepper and horseradish at a time to get the heat adjust right for you.

I think this would be okay for a cocktail sauce, but I didn't like it much with my sweet potato fries. I think I was expecting more of a sweet and spicy ketchup. It would probably be fine without the horseradish and with a little less cayenne.

I really like this.  It is like Shrimp Cocktail sauce and I am going to follow one reviewer and use it on Meatloaf.  Bet it will be great.
