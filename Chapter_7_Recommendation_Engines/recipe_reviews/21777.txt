I followed the recipe as written and after a taste test it was just OK so I added an envelope of dry onion soup to it and it was much, much better.

This was a good recipe...fast and easy to prepare but nothing to write home about. I would definitely make it again but instead of 2 cans cream of mushroom I will try 1 cr of mush and 1 golden mushroom or cream of something else just to give it a little more flavor.

Such delicious comfort food.  Smells incredible when it's baking.  Use plenty of fresh onion.  We've made this twice so far, second time we tried a boneless pork shoulder roast cut into slabs (cooked it for two hours to be sure it was done throughout)--it was great.

A very easy recipe to prepare and my husband cleaned his plate. The only change I made was to fry the pork chops in butter; remove the chops to a casserole, and added mushroom soup to the frying pan dripping plus ½ can of water. After bring the soup to a boil I then added the soup to the casserole, cover it with foil, and baked it for 30 min at 350 degrees. All in all it was very tastily.

I was looking for something that didn't require a ton of ingredients and was easy to prepare.  This recipe was it!  I've tried a pot roast cooked in a similar fashion and loved it, so I thought I would give this a whirl.  Since it is just me, I cooked one pork chop with 1/2 can of soup.  I seasoned with rosemary and onion flakes, plus salt.  I found the pork chop moist and flavorful.  This recipe is a keeper for me!  It's easy to throw in the oven after work while I take the dogs for a walk.  Thanks!

This dish was pretty good.  I enjoyed the 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup. However, I do find the recipe missing something - salt, pepper, string beans, carrots, maybe?  Whatever it is, the magic ingredient would definitely make this a stellar recipe.

Ladies and gentlemen, I am confused.  When I made this recipe, it smelled great. The pork was fantastic – I wish I had more in the freezer it was so good. The sauce, however, left something to be desired. I’m just not sure what that something is.  It’s a trifle .. well, it’s not bland. I just don’t know what it is. The dish didn’t get past the mushroom soup-beefy onion soup – gaahhhrlic - oniony-ness that seemed to overpower the pork.  That’s probably my fault, since I strayed from the recipe. But my family and I – including my picky daughter – ate it up.  But when it came to left overs, I couldn’t make myself eat it for a day or two. And then I was staaarrving for protein, and all of a sudden there was a ton of pork left over that was just begging to be consumed.  This recipe isn’t one I’d purposefully set out to make ever again. It’s not for dinner parties. But if it’s the end of the month and money is scarce, and the ingredients are something you’ve got in your pantry, (and let’s face it, most of us do) it’s some good eating.

This was easy and economical. A great base recipe to make your own. I seasoned my chops well and browned them, placed in bottom of slow cooker, mixed 1 can cream of mushroom, minced garlic, 1/2 an envelope of dried onion soup mix, about 1/4 c white wine, and 1 can of mushrooms. Then poured over the chops. I cooked this on low 6 hours and it was perfect. Finished it off with a little sour cream to help cut the salt. Served with pasta. Definitely not gourmet but a good pantry/ freezer meal when you don't feel much like cooking and are low on groceries.

Very blah. I was kind of expecting that however. Canned soup always tastes like canned soup. Won't be making again.

I have been making this recipe for years...my change to this recipe is 8 boneless thick cut pork chops, 2 cans cream of mushroom soup, salt and pepper to taste. Put all ingrediants into a 7 quart crock pot on low. When done the chops will break apart easily with a fork. My husbands favorite way for this to be served is over cooked egg noodles, another fav is over mashed potatoes. I usually put this together in the crock pot before I go to work in the morning, when I get home I just make up the noodles or potatoes and then spoon the pork chops and sauce over them. It's incredibly simple :)

Tried this last night, family loved it. We did alter just a little, we used a little less soup as we had sweet potato casserole and also we sauteed the onions till they were a little brown. Flavor was great and chops fell of bone.

This is the only way I've made pork chops since I found this recipe.

ETA - 350 degrees for 50 minutes isn't enough usually.  The meat is still pink.  I think they may have meant 400 degrees.  I usually do this in the slow cooker & let it sit on low all day.

I had thawed pork chops, and was looking for a quick recipe that isn't part of my normal cooking routine. I saw this, and had everything so have it a shot, even though it sounded too easy. I'm usually sceptic of dumping ingredients into a pan. It looked like pink liquidy goo worth onions ontop. After 50mins off cooking, i got out my cast iron skillet, and had to "Brown" everything to get it to look appetizing, after reading others reviews, I really needed to Brown the pork chops first,  and really,I should have known better. It came out good after lots of alterations, like adding garlic, sage, rosemary, thyme, and lots of cracked pepper. Also, some water since it was getting too thick. I will make this again, but start in a skillet with butter and browning the pork chops. Removing them, sauteing the onions, then aging the soup with water, the spices, then aging the pork chops back in and letting it simmer, Or transfer to the oven to bake. It was a mess going from the baking dish typ the cast iron skillet, and an extra 30to 45 mins.  I could see how out could be a glorious one dish recipe that's easy, but it didn't do well for me just dumping in a pan.

This is really simple, and I let my imagination run wild. Instead of Pork, I used Turkey Meatballs added a shot of white wine, ground pepper, minced garlic, canned mushroom saving the juices, and a couple dashes of Worchester sauce. Never added salt, because salt was already in the canned items. Served over egg noodles. It turned out awesome.

Good flavor and tender. I didn't eat it so I'm having to base this off what my husband told me to write. He said it was "okay." Not sure what he means exactly. Prob won't make it again as it didn't knock his or the kids socks off.

I'm giving this recipe five stars, for the sake of convenience only. It wasn't terrible, but it was nothing really thrilling either. I doubt I would make it again, but it was wonderfully easy and quick for a fast dinner. Thanks!

DEEEEEEEEE-LISH FROM THE FIRST BITE! MY HUSBAND & I LOVED THIS. I HAD BUTTERD RICE & BROCCOLI WITH IT & MY HUSBAND PUT SOME OF THE "GRAVY" OVER HIS RICE. I AGREE WITH ANOTHER REVIEWER, IN THAT NEXT TIME, I'D USE BONELESS CHOPS, OR BONELESS PORK BUTT CHOPS. REAL COMFORT FOOD & E-A-S-Y TOO!

It's ok as is. Seasoned, floured the pork chops and fried them first. I added in sliced mushrooms, garlic and  soy sauce (to taste). It helped enhance the flavor.

Delicious.  I used a pork loin cut into strips that were 2inx4in.  I only used 1 can of soup because I wasn't cooking up a lot of pork.  My meat was somewhat frozen so I cooked for two hours and it was perfect.

It was very yummy and family friendly!  Made a few changes. I used 1 can cream of chicken and mushroom soup with half a can of milk mixed in. I crushed up french's fried onions and sprinkled them over the top of the pork chops, a little garlic salt and generously peppered the chops. Then poured the soup mixture over the top then covered with aluminum foil. Baked for 1 hr then served over steamed rice. No photo, because we ate it all :)

I wanted to try this with a slow cooker.  I read some of the reviews and tweaked it by adding 1 envelope of dry onion soup mix and frying my chops. It turned out pretty well but I should have sprayed the sides of the cooker with some type of oil. It was kinda of greasy because instead of "browning" my chops, I fried them. LOL...will try again.

This is part of my roommate's all-time favorite meal ~ served with green beans and whipped potatoes ~ mmmmmm comfort food at its best. I leave out the onions though because I'm the only one in the house who likes them. :-(
