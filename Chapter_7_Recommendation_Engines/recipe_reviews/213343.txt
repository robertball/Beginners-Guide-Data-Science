This is a wonderful stew.  It is worth the extra trouble of going finding the beer.  It has a flavor that only alcohol can do for a dish.  Will make again.

Best Irish stew with Guinness beer I've eaten.  I made this for a ski party and it was a hit with everyone.  It had rich, hearty taste.  I would recommend it.

This recipe is almost identical to the stew my Irish mother served in Montreal about once a week.  Myself and all of my siblings still make it at least twice a month.  Note, when we cook veggies throughout the week, we save the cooking water in a "stew pot" which is kept in the freezer.  When the pot is full of veggie stock, it's time to make this stew.

I was able to use a nice hunk of leftover roast beef for this, which was already seasoned, so I didn't need the additional s&p.  Didn't have the turnip, so omitted it, and I also only had Guinness Black Lager on hand, so used that and it turned out great!!  This will become my go-to beef stew from now on - better than at the Irish pub!

Didn't use veggie stock, used water and a bullion cube (what I had on hand).  I used a regular dark lager (also on hand) and put it all in the crockpot on low.  Exactly how I like my stew!

My family loved this stew! I didn't have the turnips, but it turned out great without. Followed the recipe and it was perfect. Thank you for sharing!

Great simple recipe. Cooking the stew meat until the liquid evaporates helps the meat become very tender. Don't skip this step. Following the recipe, with no substitutes, turns out perfect. However, It's really easy to modify the ingredients according to taste or depending on what vegetables you have on hand.
