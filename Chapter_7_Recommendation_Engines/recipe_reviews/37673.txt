This soup was great! It would be great as just a plain soup too. I roasted my own red peppers, and guessed by using 4. It wasn't nearly enough, so I reduced the other ingredients. I'd probably try 7 peppers next time. I'll definitely make it again.

Excellent soup!  I didn't use all the pasta, only 1/3.  I also added extra broth since it thickened too quickly.  Added a few tbsp of whipping cream at the end.

Flavorful & Fabulous!  I loved this.  I made it pretty much to the recipe except that my grocery store only had ONE 24 oz jar left! To make up for what I was missing I took three fresh red peppers and broiled them until the skins bubbled - then removed the skins and pureed them up.  I can't say enough about the flavor of this soup - although next time I might try it without the mushrooms.  I don't think the mushrooms brought too much to the party and I think it would be prettier without them.

A very easy and very tasty recipe, I've made it several times now.  When I don't have tortellini, I sometimes 2 tablespoons of tomato paste and heavy cream to make this more of a bisque.  With some warm crusty bread, this is comfort food at its best!

I didn't have mushrooms or tortellini, so I left them out - it was still excellent.  Even my little ones liked it.

I have made this recipe four or five times and it is delicious.  I adjusted the broth and amount of tortellini because it came out more like a stew the first time I made it. Will definitely make this one again!

I made this last night, was pretty darn good.  However, I did cut back on the garlic, omitted the pasta, added a splash of cream and the most special addition, cedar plank grilled sea scallops.  Now, that was a great combination.

This was surprisingly good for how simple it is.  It's a little on the spicy side, but I personally like it that way.  I would make this again.

I followed this recipe pretty closely.  It wasn't my favorite.  I felt that it needed something.  The pepper taste needed a littele tempering.  If I made this again I might try adding cream at the end like someone else suggested. I may skip the mushrooms too. They just didn't make sense to me.

This is a good basic recipe that showed up at the right time.  It was time to use up the red peppers we roasted and froze 4 months ago.  It is easily modified to supplies at hand.  I have to go GF so used rice pasta with fried sausage in place of tortellini.  Per suggestions, a splash of cream enriched it.  Cremini mushrooms were a positive influence on the overall success of this recipe.  The real topper was a Parmigano Regiano and fried red onion/shallot garnish.  We will double our red pepper roasting and freezing next year, thanks to this recipe.

this could not be easier or quicker.  I followed the recipe minus the mushrooms and tortellini since I didn't have them on hand.  I added a few dashes of red pepper flakes and about 2 tablespoons of sour cream and it was delicious.  This is a definite keeper - even the kids loved it!

This was fabulous.  It should be modified into a pasta sauce it is sooo good.  I used the Italian herb mixture as well as just a tad of cream, not too much.  I took the hint from the other cooks.  I also omitted the mushrooms simply because I am not crazy about them.  This was great with grilled cheese sandwiches or even tuna sandwiches which is what ended up happening for the next two days.  I am eating the rest now and cannot believe how good this is!  Not to mention easy to make.

I roasted my own peppers, sliced my own mushrooms. I also used home made veggie stock instead of canned chicken stock. And I left out the tortellini altogether. Not bad!

Was very excited to try the recipe. Agree with other reviewers that something is missing.  Might be better with onions, fresh basil, and no oregano. The mushrooms do not add anything and would use half the amount of the tortellini. Won't be making it again.

Very flavorable, super easy. I didn't have fresh mushrooms, so I used canned, also added fresh garlic, and added a dab of cream. Next time I'll make it using scallops instead of tortellini (good suggestion) by previous reviewer

It was a good flavor but I was a little disappointed that the red peppers were not stronger tasting since I love them so much. I tried to go skimpy on the whipping cream but it really is true that the more you add the better it tastes. I ended up using this more as a pasta sauce rather than a soup since it is so fattening, but I think I'll stick with tomato sauces in the future. It was a lot of work for a good but not great flavor.

Very tasty.  It was a lot stronger than I expected it to be, even though I used less red peppers than the recipe called for.  However, the mushrooms and tortellini give it a good texture.  I think next time I'll use a pinch of rosemary, but otherwise, an excellent recipe.

Yum, i had some wrinkly red peppers so I did a search under the ingredients and  this came up.  I "roasted" the peppers under broiler, steamed, skinned and followed the recipes.  I did not add the pasta.  My husband loved it, thought it needed a big parmisan crouton.  I think it is very healthy and will make it when fresh peppers are  on sale.

Love this soup! And So easy to make!  I only used 1 jar of roasted red peppers, omitted the mushrooms, used fresh basil instead of dried, and 9 ounces of tortellini (I mixed cheese and sausage tortellini).  Even the kids love it!   Great topped with finely shredded mozzarella cheese!
Also, this would be a great substitute for a pasta sauce!

Used what I had in my fridge already. I roasted 5 sliced red peppers and package of fresh mushrooms with some salt free Italian herbs, a clove of garlic and a little olive oil in my oven at 450 degrees for  20 minutes.  Put it in my food processor and pulsed it until it was a nice thick sauce. Put it in a sauce pan on the stove top,  added low salt chicken broth and 1/4 cup of Merlot until it was the right consistency for a nice thick soup.  Added more Italian herbs to taste.  Simmered 10 min. Served with Feta cheese crumbles on top to garnish.  I am going back for seconds.

I used semi-hot red banana peppers(8) instead of bells. added 3 carrots and 1 sauteed onion and 4 sauteed garlic cloves. Pureed all ingredients(didn't have 'shrooms) until smooth, then simmered in a pot for abot 15 minutes. Didn't add pasta.Used about 18oz. of broth. It came out kind of like a bisque.This made about 3-4 bowls. If you like a bit of heat, this was awesome!

This did not "thicken" as promised.  It wasn't our favorite.  The best part was the tortellini.

Pretty tasty - next time I will probably cut the tortellini by half...since it was more like pasta & sauce than soup. I like how easy it was!

I left out the mushrooms and pasta.  Thought the flavor was very strong so I added heavy cream, some tomato paste, and a pureed can of diced tomatoes.  This sweetened it up enough for me and also made the soup more affordable as it served more people.

This had a good flavor but I think that the garlic is way too much for 2 servings. I will use less garlic next time and add the cream cause it was more like spaghetti sauce then soup. Good flavor just too garlicky.

Pretty good, particularly because it was so easy to make and the tortellini was great in it. My only issue is that even though I love lots of seasonings and flavor, I thought there was way too much oregano in the soup. A little oregano goes a long way, at least for me. Also, that much pepper would make the soup REALLY peppery, so I halved it and it still had quite a strong spicy kick. This is a recipe where I would definitely recommend seasoning to taste instead of following the directions as written. I will definitely make it again and simply adjust the seasonings; thanks for the recipe, RLINDA!

This was delicious and easy to prepare in my Vitamix, although I did have to cook the tortellini separately.  The tortellini made this hearty enough for me to eat for dinner by itself.  The soup is delicious and I would omit the pasta if serving with a sandwich or something else.   I didn’t have oregano and my peppers (what I had on hand) had dill and garlic added.  I rinsed the peppers but there was still a hint of dill which did not add to the taste of the soup.  Next time, and there will be a next time, I will either roast my own peppers or use a plain bottled variety.

This is very similar to a recipe I invented some years ago. I had some home-made chicken stock (broth) and wanted a change so I raided the freezer and found a large bag of frozen peppers. I didn't add mushrooms or tortellini but the rest of the ingredients were the same. I sprinkled some roasted dried fried onions on top to add crunch. Lovely!!!

The taste of the soup was wonderful and very easy to make.  My only point when I make it the next time would be to double the liquid ingredients.  It really did seem more like a tortellini with sauce over it than a soup and I didn't even use the full amount of tortellini that was suggested in the ingredients.  I used about half that much.  So, half the tortellini and double the main soup ingredients.  Otherwise, a great soup, especially on a cold winter day!

Sorry Rlinda, but I didn't like this 'soup' at all.  I followed the recipe exactly without the tortellini though.  I thought it was too spicy (and I like spicy) and was overpowered by too many competing spices (too much pepper, too much of every spice actually).  It is not as subtle soup, but just hits you in the face.

Also, it was unclear if we were to re-blend the mushrooms in after boiling or not (I did, with one of those hand blenders; still not better).

I'll never make this one again.

I didnt really care for the "roasted pepper" flavor.  I think overall the soup is okay, just not fantastic like all the reviews.  Maybe i need to use the Trader Joe's roasted peppers!

I tried making as stated but it really need a lot of doctoring. Added to some sugar to sweeten.  It was very bland. Added cream like others suggested. Used goat cheese tortellini which gave it more flavor and topped it off Romano cheese and croutons. As it was it was not good.

Very good! I wasn't sure how the mushrooms would add to the soup but they totally work. I used vegetable broth and added a little bit of cream just to make it more bisque-like.

Incomplete, and too acidic... really missing flavors.. 
I am lucky to have a super-husband who is really good at fixing my cooking so dinner still was served..
Here are a few tips he gave me:
He used baking soda to cut the acid off.
He then used sour cream 
Recommended spices were good, but he said fresh basil would be better.
He also put crashed red pepper to kick it up a bit.

Basically, look for a different recipe.

We followed the recipe exactly and we ended up with bowls full of pasta and mushrooms with a red sauce - not at all what we expected from the recipe and picture.  We would use smaller (or no or less) pasta and maybe pulverize the mushrooms or cut much smaller. It said to only put the peppers in the food processor - maybe it all should have gone in to make it more soup-like.  Will try it again - with alterations!

I thought that the recipe was a little on the plain side, but a great start for a simple healthy soup, so I added cauliflower and carrots to the soup and in the food processor I added Italian stewed tomatoes. This is a good base recipe though. I am going to add the heavy cream next time I feel like splurging!. I think that will be a real treat!

I added small bite sized pieces of sweet Italian sausage that I had browned in a frying pan.  It added meat to the otherwise meatless dish and was delicious.

So quick and easy to make.  Our store was out of fresh tortellini so I used fresh cheese ravioli instead.  This can definitely stand as a main dish for dinner.  Will make again and again!

This has great flavor, just needs a little thickening or something, it didn't feel substantial enough. Overall, if you are looking for a light meal, this one will do ya fine.

Was  amazing! Whole family loved it.  Ended up more of a pasta dish with sauce than a soup with pasta.  But that just made it more of a meal. Would also be good on its own without pasta.

This was okay. I thought it would have more depth of flavor to it. I definitely liked the tortellini in it. I left out the mushrooms because my husband doesn't like them. I ended up adding some seasoned ground beef, and I liked it better.

It's good but needs to be creamy, maybe some heavy cream?

Great flavor. I used some shredded chicken instead of mushrooms and it turned out delicious. Next time I will probably just use some rotini pasta instead of the tortellini out of personal preference.

Not too bad!  I used Whole Wheat Elbow Pasta because I didn't have tortellini.  I also added 4 pureed garlic cloves.  My hubby LOVES this and wants it added to our regular "menu" :)  Thank you for a pretty good easy-peasy soup!  He did suggest that next time I make it to try and add some scallops, shrimp or shredded chicken. hmmm

This receipe was amazing...I added a package of kielbasa which my family raved about.  I put it in the crockpot in the morning, when I get home from work throw in the tortellini and in about 45 minutes its ready.  This is definitely a recipe I will be using a lot this winter!

I roast my own red peppers in the oven, for the mushrooms I use baby bellas and I always use fresh herbs rather than dried, really gives it some extra flavor!!

Really tasty!  Don't really care for mushrooms at my place so left them out- didn't miss them.  This is good with or without tortellini.

Simple! Yummy! I added some herbs de province as someone else's suggestion and don't think it would have been NEARLY as good without it! My suggestion is not to add so much noodles, because mine was not soupy at all. It was more like noodles with a little sauce on top. I would have liked it to be more soupy like in the picture.

This soup is excellent.  I did, however, added 1 c of heavy cream (not so healthy but really good)  Next time I think I am going to add diced tomatoes.

This soup sounded yummy. But then when I tried to make it the consistency was all wrong. It was very watery. And I consider myself a pretty good cook and this recipe is simple. But didn't turn out at all like I thought it would. I would not recommend it

This Roasted Red Pepper Soup was as much of a delight to eat as it was to make. Like a few others who posted, I left out the mushrooms and added more broth. I'm wondering about adding some sausage next time to change up the flavor off and on. This soup is so delicious, easy and fast to make it will be served often. Thank you!

I made this and suprisiningly it was REALLY good! If you kind of like that red pepper taste. The cheese totellini really made this pop. One thing i did differently was i chopped the mushrooms up into tiny cubs instead of slices. very nice!

A very good soup. I did use cremini mushrooms which I sliced and sauteed first with a bit of garlic, and I put in egg noodles instead of the tortellini. Next time I will try part roasted tomato and part roasted pepper, and maybe add some chili powder for a little extra somethin-somethin :-)  I will keep experimenting with this recipe.

Very tasty and filling. I once made the mistake of using dry tortellini: stick with the fresh stuff for best results.

This seemed to be very red-peppery.  That was the only flavor that really stood out.  I felt like it needed something more - perhaps some italian sausage - or maybe I'll try the cream idea.
