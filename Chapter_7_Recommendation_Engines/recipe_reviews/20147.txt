Not at all like traditional cornbread.  Very moist and sweet.  My husband says its like the cornbread side they serve at Chevy's Fresh Mex.  We liked it with honey butter.

I also thought this recipe reminded me of a side dish I get at Rio Bravo....it's YUMMY!!!  Very easy and quick.  I used a round pie dish and cooked for 35 minutes.  Turned out perfect.

My husband claims this is the best cornbread he has ever had.  I used two boxes of the Jiffy mix, doubled the eggs and milk, but used only about 1/3 c sugar because the Jiffy mix is so sweet. I also added one fresh chopped jalapeno, which added enough flavor to make my husband happy without making the cornbread too spicy for me.  I baked it in an 9' square pan for about 10 mins longer.  It was super moist and the perfect side for my chili. Thanks!

I really liked this!  I doubled the recipe and then added fontina cheese on top and let it melt in the warm oven.  It was soooo good!  My daughter who's 4 loved it and so did my husband.  Reminded me of a Cheese on a stick (Corn Dog but with cheese instead of a hot dog) It's a huge carnival yummy!  YUMM!  Thanks!

This is the cornbread recipe I'd always wished to find - perfectly moist, not too sweet, and doesn't taste like a convenience food. I made a few changes, but nothing drastic: I skipped the sugar entirely (the creamed corn is already sweetened), used 1% milk instead of regular, and baked it in muffin cups (350 degrees for 25 minutes). I will make this again and again with no other changes. Delicious!

This cornbread is delicious!  I've been searching for just the right recipe...this is it!! It's moist & has just the right touch of sweetness! (*great side with BBQ chicken*)  My husband isn't a cornbread fan, but he loved it too! And what makes it even better...it's so easy!  *Thanks*

The easiest and most delicious cornbread. I am allergic to eggs, ommitted them, and it was still moist.  So sweet! Thank you so much.  My mom's coworkers want the recipe.

This is very similar to a corn pudding recipe of a now defunct mexican restaurant chain of which I used to be a general manager.  People were always asking for the recipe.  Instead of creamed corn we'd use kernel corn and instead of milk we'd use heavy cream.  We used to make much larger batches and since we're not using creamed corn I've estimated that you should use about a cup of the heavy cream.  We also used to use a steamer oven to cook it so put a pan of water on a rack at the lowest level.  That will bring this up to 5 stars.

THIS is the one. Don't look any further if you are looking for a sweet, moist cornbread (like I have been)! Thanks to the reviewers who tested and perfected (and likely corrected) the recipe, I used the following: 2 boxes Jiffy mix, 2/3 cup milk, 2 eggs, 1 14.75 oz can creamed corn (not drained or rinsed, dump it all in!), 1/4 cup sugar, 1/4 cup honey. Baked in a 9x9 square pan at 350 for 50 minutes. Could have used a few mins more but it was so thick and moist!! That's why I did it in the smaller pan, to keep it thick and cake-like. My apologies to the cornbread purists, this is probably nothing like what you enjoy, but it's what I've come to love.

I made changes based on comments. It definitely needed to be doubled, or it would have been really flat. I doubled everything except the canned corn, and I used only 1/4 cup of sugar. I also added 3 tablespoons of unsalted butter. It was a big hit and some said it was the best cornbread they had ever had. Next time I'll try it with some jalapeno added.

I've made cornbread this way for years. But you don't need anywhere near that much sugar. Maybe 2 TB to 1/4 cup at most.  I make it in a 8" cast iron pan.  Is there any other way to make cornbread besides cast iron.  Anyway, thanks for the recipe.

Took advice of another reviewer & doubled the recipe, added 2 chopped jalapenos, BUT I only used 1/4 cup sugar, as the Jiffy mix already has plenty of sugar.  Baked in 9x13 dark pan for 40 min.  So chewy and yummy!  I love Boston Market's corn muffins, but this is even better!  If recipe weren't doubled, I think you'd get really flat cornbread.

Doubled the recipe & baked in a 10" cast iron skillet.  First warmed skillet in the oven with a coating of oil then poured in the batter which made a marvelous crispy sweet crust.  The sweet almost corn-pudding-like cornbread was great with a bowl of spicy black bean soup.  Will try with no added sugar next time to see if it is sweet enough.

I made the recipe as written except I knew to use a smaller pan (I used 8x8).  I thought that 1/2 cup of sugar might be too sweet, but I read the first 7 top rated reviews and no one said it needed to be less, so I followed the recipe.  I like sweets, but YIKES!!!  We did like the moistness and the texture, but it tasted sickly sweet to us.  At first I thought next time I'll reduce it to 1/4 cup, but both the corn bread/muffin mix and the cream corn has sugar in it and I'm not sure if it needs more sugar added to still be sweet.

I've already reviewed this, but I had to write and rave more about this recipe.  This cornbread tastes so great, and it is so perfect!  I'd been looking for this recipe for a long time, and this is just right!  I've made this a few times since I found the recipe.  The last time I made it, my company was fighting over the last pieces!  I think I'll double or triple the recipe next time!

I doubled the recipe, using two 8oz."complete" corn muffin mix packages - no eggs or sugar needed; just add milk.
(I added about 1/4 cup more milk to the recipe to compensate for not using eggs.)
It took longer to bake, about 45 minutes, in a 375 degree oven - but was still very moist.
We enjoyed it a lot!  I'll make this one again.  Thanks:)

Made this to go with chili. Used a little less sugar (maybe 1/4 cup), and baked them as muffins. Baked for 35 mins at 375.

DELICIOUS!! I'd recommend using a smaller pan.  The cornbread came out a little too flat in a 9x13 pan.

Very tasty! I put a whole can of creamed corn in (15 oz) and left out the sugar. It came out perfectly. Delish! I'll never make cornbread without the addition of creamed corn again. :)

Finally!!! A recipe for the kind of cornbread my husband loves..I had looked all over. It tastes exactly like described...sweet and chewy. The corn adds fiber and the whole recipe is economical. It was extremely fast to make too...I didn't even beat the egg first...just dumped it all in there together and stirred! It tastes good enough to eat all by itself (and we did! :) Thanks for sharing!

This was a fairly good recipe but it was a little too sweet.  I would cut the sugar in half.  Creamed corn is already sweet.  The texture was sticky, but a good change from the typical corn bread.  It wasn't too dry which is, in my opinion, the worst part of most corn bread.  Thanks for the recipe.

Super yummy! Only reason I gave it 4 stars was because it didn't make very much.  I made 2 batches and let the 2nd batch sit for 3-4 minutes before putting it in the pan which made it thicker and better.

Super easy, 5-minute-prep side dish.  I used Jiffy corn muffin mix, unsweetened plain almond milk, and half a full-size (15oz) can of creamed corn.  I only used a scant 1/4 cup sugar, based on reviews.  Baked it in an 8x8 pyrex dish.  It's not the same as making it from scratch - at all - but it tasted good with veggie chili.  My kidlet could make this on her own, which is really nice.

Wonderful if you like sweet and savory! I added a few things as well:1/4c bacon bits, 1/2-3/4c chopped ham, 1 sm can diced green chilis, 1/4c butter and 3/4-1c fiesta blend cheese or mont jack/cheddar mix. Add all ingredients except butter in bowl plus original recipe's ingredients. Melt butter in 13X9 in pan in oven then pour batter into pan. So goooooood!!! Wanted to add New Mexico green chilis instead of canned green chilis but too hot for kids. REALLY tasty and makes a complete meal if you add a green salad on the side. Very decadent though...;)

I followed the recipe almost exactly (as per other suggestions, I added slightly less sugar) and I used the Jiffy cornbread mix, but I was just not impressed.  It would do in a pinch, but I felt the flavour was pretty bland and nothing special.  Oh yea, and I used a 8x8 square baking pan- the 13x9 must be an error.  I'll keep searching for other recipes.

SO GOOD and easy too! I would probably classify these as sweet corn cakes. The cornbread mix I bought was a 15 oz box so I doubled the milk, eggs, and sugar and used a whole can of creamed corn. Baked these up as muffins to go with the ham and lentil soup also from this site. Yummo!!

Was looking for a recipe using creamed corn and followed it exactly. Can't call it moist, have to call it wet! Baked in 9x13 for 45 min. Like another reviewer stated, "flat as a pancake." Dissapointed, won't even try to doctor it. Good ingredients wasted.
I'll keep looking for that perfect cornbread, I know it's out there!!

This is without a doubt the best corn bread I have ever had.  I did reduce the sugar per other reviews and it was perfect.  I hate dry corn bread and have been searching for a moist recipe for years.  I found it!  And it's so easy.  Thank you!

I loved this cornbread recipe. It was awesome. I followed it as directed except 1> I did not add any sugar as suggested by other reviewers using the “sweetened” creamed corn it came out sweet enough. If you prefer sweeter corn bread I suggest adding sugar to taste 2> Also per other reviewers I used the Jiffy mix. 3>I also cooked it for about 30mins and then let it sit on the counter top for 5-10mins.  It was sooooo warm and gooey, even better the next day! My husband who had never tasted cornbread with real corn in it before was skeptical at first but when he tasted it he was really really pleased. Using a 8x9 pan it was still thin so next time I will use double the recipe. But great recipe.

Made it for Thanksgiving, and the whole family loved it!  Per other reviews used Jiffy muffin mix, and didn't add any sugar. Used 4 ounces of cream corn and 4 ounces of whole corn, so it would not be to moist. Baked in a 9x9. PERFECT

The cornbread itself was great and so simple!  The only thing that I find questionable is the actual recipe itself.  I picked up a box of Jiffy cornbread muffin mix (8.5 oz) and realized the recipe only calls for one box.  Basically the recipe has the same ingredients as on the box just adding sugar and cream corn so how in the world do you put it in a 9x13 pan and it turn out successful??!!  I don't know it didn't sound right like maybe it was a misprint so I played it safe and baked it in an 8x8 pan for about 35 mins and it was perfect.  So simple yet so many compliments!

I LOVE this cornbread recipe! I am not a fan of "dry" cornbread, but this is the exact opposite of dry. It is moist, sweet and delicious. I love to eat it hot out of the oven. I have also served it with chili on top. Everyone loves it!

This corn bread was so easy to make and delicious - moist, sweet, and flavorful. I also loved the peices of corn in the bread. However, I only gave it 4 stars because it crumbled and fell apart while cutting and picking up to eat. I'll probably make this again, but maybe lessen the dry ingredients to see how the bread holds together.

Made this last night with chili. Only used 1/4C sugar as suggested by others. Creamed corn only came in 14oz cans so I just used a little less than the whole can. Also used glass pie dish. I really think 9x13 pan would be way to big for a single batch. Cooked 35min, turned out great. Super soft and fluffy. This will be my go to cornbread recipe from now on, thanks!

This was pretty good! I'll admit to preferring savory foods, but I opted for this recipe because it's kid-friendly. Corn happens top be the only vegetable my daughter likes. While this recipe is sweet, it sure is a healthier alternative for an after school snack than some of our other choices. I opted to make this recipe in a cast iron skillet. I used the whole 14.5 oz can of creamed corn; the corbread was very moist on the inside and nice and crispy on the bottom and sides from the pan. I'm not sure how long I baked it, maybe 20-25 minutes; my oven is nor calibrated correctly so I usually just eye stuff for doneness.

This recipe is now as staple for every family gathering but I have to warn everyone that the 9 X 13 pan is WAY too large (even the photo shown is not a 9 X 13) - unless you like your cornbread 1/4 inch thin and dry. I use an 8 X 8 and increase cooking time (my oven is from the 60s so everything is increased!). The cornbread then comes out thick and moist. I also decrease the sugar to maybe a couple of tablespoons, I've even take the sugar out completely and it's still really good. Creamed corn is so sweet already and I find the bread goes with food better this way, not as a stand alone dessert!

Ok I swear this is the best sweet bread I have ever tasted! I took mine out at 28 minutes and let it sit about 15 minutes.  When I dug in it was so-o chewy and warm and... even a little gooey in the middle. Yuuuuumm!!! This is THE cornbread recipe I will use forever. Thank you Laura :)

A great recipe.  Definitely cut back on the amount of sugar! I also baked this in a 9x9 pan because we like thicker pieces of cornbread.  By doing this, I needed to increase the time it baked. Another option is to increase the temperature to 375 degrees.

This was good.  I halved the sugar, using 2T. white sugar and 2T. honey.  Family enjoyed it.  Also baked it in an 8"x8"pan.  Will make again.

I am not rating this higher, because I have this recipe in the oven right now.  What surprised me was that the recipe called for a 9x13 pan and the recipe ingredients were not nearly enough to fill that size pan.  I did not see any comments about this.

This is EXACTLY what I have been looking for! It's very moist and a HUGE favorite. Like previous reviews, I skipped out on the sugar and it turned out absolutely perfect. I also used the JIFFY cornbread mix, and baked mine for about 40 minutes. Will definately use again!

Wow was this good!  Didn't change a thing except cooked it in a 8 x 8 pan and used just a sprinkle of sugar.  Very moist and delicious!  Thank you for the post!

Great recipe!  I doubled it for a 9x13' pan and left out the sugar (the Jiffy mix already has enough for me!).  Thanks!!

Very good flavor, but the texture was TOO light and crumbly (yet still moist).  I like my cornbread to really BE THERE--thick, dense.  It was very quick and easy, but I won't be making it again.

Everyone that tries this cornbread loves it!  It is very sweet so I usually put a little less than 1/2 a cup of sugar.

I've made this several times now, exactly as written, and it's always perfect. This is the only recipe I make because it's the cornbread my husband asks for time and again! So easy and quick, and absolutely delicious!! Thanks for the great recipe :)
Only thing I do differently is double the recipe, because there's never enough!

I have been making cornbread like this for years.  I do not add the sugar but I do add a minced jalapeno pepper or two and a hand full of cheddar, colby or pepper jack cheese. I think the corn has a lot to do with the moistness of this.

Loved this recipe!!!  Very moist, sweet cornbread!  I, like some other users, like my cornbread thick.  I doubled the recipe if cooking in a 9 x 13 pan.  Otherwise, I would bake in an 8 x 8.  We love to eat this with chili or taco soup!

So I did everything it said but the batter seemed really thin in a 9x13 pan. I went ahead and tried it and it came out very very thin. While it is absolutely delicious, I like my cornbread big! Guess I will have to try doubling it next time.

Like other reviewers suggested, I doubled all the ingredients except the cream corn. Delish.  I put it in a 8x8 pan and served with chili.  It is a sweet cornbread.

Before I made this, I read some of reviews that said it was too sweet with the sugar, so I made it without and it was perfect! Delicious, still plenty sweet, moist and dense.

All I can say is WOW !!!!!!!!! But I'll say more. This is so easy and delicious. I followed the recomandations of others and cut back on the amount of sugar and baked in a 8x8 dish. It was sweet and moist with great texture. As easy and tasty as this is I'll never have an excuse not to have cornbread when I want.

Love this recipe! Moist and sweet. And my apt smelled heavenly while it baked. One note-- I used a 9x9 baking dish rather than a 9x13.

This was very good.  I used Marie  Callendar's packaged mix, 2/3 c. milk, 2 eggs, 1 can of the creamed corn and 1 cup of sugar.  I baked it in a 9 x 13 pan for about 45 minutes.  It turned out more like a cake than cornbread.  It could have been the mix.  Either way, it sure was yummy!

Fantastic!  Simple to make and delicious to boot.  I didn't have any milk so I used some powdered milk (3 T) and 1/3 c. water.  I used 1/4 c. vanilla sugar and 1/4. c honey.  It was light and sweet.  Mine needed to for about 40 minutes because I used a 7 X 11 pan for a taller cornbread - and the edges still weren't burned.  It was fabulous.  I made a bit of honey butter to spread on the top.  Can't say enough.

too easy and deliciously chewy...the creamed corn is a great addition as the added corn texture makes it that much better.  I left out the added sugar since the corn muffin mix had sugar already.  Great recipe!

I took others advice and only used 1/3C of sugar.  We took this cornbread camping with us...it was so moist and delicious!  I grilled slices on the grill and poured chili over it in bowls and it became a camping favorite! MMM MMM!Thanks so much for the great recipe!

Yummy!!  I doubled this recipe - used two 7.5 ounce boxes of cornbread mix and one 14.5 ounce can of creamed corn.  I used half and half instead of the milk.  Also - I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup and added 1 teaspoon of Slyvia's Soulful Seasoned Salt.  Came out fantastic beyond belief!!!!!  Thanks!!

This recipe was so simple to make and it went well with barbecued chicken.  The bread definitely stays moist which isn't always the case with plain corn muffins.  Thanks for the recipe I will make it again.

I've been making my own version of this recipe 20yrs or so, it is the best. The creamed corn gives it its moistness and it pairs well with many dishes or simply by its self with only drizzled honey or strawberry jam. I am a southern cook, taught by many great southern cooks throughout my life so giving my 2 cents of advice ...
to achieve the thickness/height,definitely use 2 boxes of Jiffy yellow mix doubling the recipe. also ,using a cast iron pan is ideal...greased &heated before you pour in your batter then immediately into the oven , gives it a nice crisp edge. I like to put a few tablespoons of real butter as well and brush the top with butter after its done. The sugar issue here...wow...is not necessary. The yellow cornbread mix and creamed corn already has a sweetness to it but if you feel the need, only a couple teaspoons of sugar will achieve more sweetness. Remember...this is cornbread , not cake. Enjoy everyone and Happy New Year??

The first time I made this I thought it was too sweet. Since then I double the corn mix, eggs and milk, use a soup size can of the corn and only 1/2 cup of sugar. I always get asked for the recipe.

I doubled the recipe and used half the sugar as suggested by other reviews. I used one can of regular corn and one can of creamed corn. I cooked it at 350 but it took at least 45 minutes.  It turned out amazing! This will be my go to cornbread recipe.

Family loved this! I did reduce the sugar by half. My youngest son loves chili and cornbread and requested it for supper. I was looking for a very moist cornbread and gave this a try. Definitely a keeper recipe!

This is really good. I have made it without the sugar also (not on purpose, just forgot it), and it is just as good. So I don't know if it truly needs 1/2 cup... regardless, it is good either way. I usually make it in a pan a bit smaller than 9x13 so it is a bit "higher" when it is cut. I have made this many times, just realized I had not rated it. Yumm!!

Very easy and delicious - however it is plenty sweet enough with only 2 tbls. brown sugar. 1/3c. is overkill. Also, I found that storing leftovers covered overnight leads to a very moist, unappetizing mush, but it is easily made delicious again by toasting slices in a pan on the stove!

Delicious!  Perfect with a southwestern meal.  I did cut the sugar in half, per other reviewers, but that was the only change.  Will certainly make more often.

I love this recipe, sooo good and sooo easy!  I made a double batch using 2 boxes Jiffy Cornbread mix, I did add less sugar and used a whole 15 oz can cream corn.  I made one batch with jalapenos and one without, the jalapenos added a nice flavor without too much heat.   I cooked them in cast iron cornbread pans to go with a big batch of jambalaya, everyone loved them.

This was WAY too sweet for me. Next time I make this, I'll cut the sugar in half. I also had to cook it longer than 30 minutes as it was still wet. I cooked it at 375 for 45 minutes.

This was very tasty, but something wen awry.  It didn't rise or I didn't use enough mix or something.  I used one box of jiffy mix, and they came out flat as a pancake in my pan!  I will try it again with fresher mix and see if that helps, but my mix was not out of date.

The best cornbread I have ever had. Usually cornbread is dry and mealy. This cornbread is more like a corn cake. It is sweet and moist. Pairs well w/holiday meals, BBQs, and chili. Wonderful recipe (also very forgiving if you dont quite have the right amounts of the ingredients it always comes out well). I get compliments on it ALL THE TIME!

I made this once for dinner and my boyfriend loved it; and he doesn't have a particular preference for cornbread!  I also really enjoyed it.  It is very moist and not at all dry like normal cornbread.  I reduced the sugar to 1/4 C as it was already sweet with the cream corn and it was perfect this way.  I also baked it more like 35-40 minutes becuase it seemed a little too soft at 30 minutes.  I made homemade honey butter to go on top of it and served it with spicy homemade wings I had made and it was a great combination!  You should really try this recipe!!

Made it just like the recipe said, found it a little too sweet, might reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup like others have suggested.  Otherwise, had a great texture!

Super good and easy!  Everyone raved about this. It was very moist.   I doubled this and baked it in a 9x13 pan and it worked good.

Very good cornbread! I cut the sugar in half but it was too sweet anyway. I bet it depends on the cornbread mix you're using. I was using Marie Calendars corn bread mix. Thanks for sharing the recipe! My family enjoyed it.

I made this recipe, but with some changes.  Instead of adding sugar, I added 1/2 c of corn flour and two table spoons of butter.  We thought the bread was sweet enough as it was, and I also used lowfat buttermilk instead of regular milk.  My husband and I loved it!

This is not hold in your hand bread. This is eat with a fork and know that you are gaining weight but loving it anyway. If you want the dry crumbly kind of corn bread this is not it. This stuff is so good my kids think it is dessert.

Good, moist, but not overly sweet.  I didn't use any sugar.  Not the cornbread I made on New Year's - I need to find that one again!  Try Awesome and Easy Corn Casserole(?)

I combined this with another recipe and it turned out absolutely perfect.  I added an extra egg and a dollop of sour cream to the batter. (That made it very moist but not mushy like the other recipe).  I made muffin sizes to reduce cooking time to about 17 minutes.

This was very easy to make.  Next time, I would either double the recipe for the 9x13 pan, or make it in a 9x9 pan because the cornbread was not very thick.  I also used less sugar, and it tasted great.

Well I did not read too well and used 15 oz can of creamed corn :) I reduced sugar to 1/4 cup and added some jalapenos for my hubby. Baked in 9x9 pan. It worked out fine, just little too wet (but that was my fault) Good recipe.

I made this into 12 regular sized muffins; not a good idea.  the muffins sunk in the middle and stuck horribly to the muffin papers.  I only used 1/4 cup sugar & that was plenty! the taste was very good. I would make this again, but only in a square pan.

Excellent.  It was cakelike.  Very moist and not crumbly like the traditional corn bread. My boyfriend who isn't a big fan of cornbread said that was the best one he ever had and ate a lot.  I love cornbread and think this recipe is up there.

Great moist taste and extremely easy!  The muffin mix allows you to skip some steps needed for most homemade cornbread recipes.  Like many other people suggested, I added a little less than a 1/3 cup of sugar, and it was still sweet - not too sweet, but just right.

Great recipe. My husband was not a fan of cornbread at all and never touched it when I served the traditional recipe. I've now ONLY used this recipe and he goes back for seconds and thirds! A big hit with the kids too.

This had a good flavor, but had the texture more of a spoon bread.  I made it to crumble in some bean soup.  It was too mushy to do that.  Makes a great spoon bread, though!

The only reason I am giving this recipe a lower rating is b/c when I made it, twice now, it tasted awesome once it was in the mouth, but the after taste was extremely bitter....you wanted to eat it cause the first couple chews were fantastic, but the after taste was awful.  I followed all the instructions, but used an 8 X 8 baking pan.  I also used the Jiffy mix, which someone had commented was good to use.  Don't know what happened.  Any suggestions why it became so bitter would be helpful, cause I can't figure it out?????

Finally... I have been looking and looking for a recipe that would give me the kind of corn bread pudding type stuff my favortie Mexican restaurant serves and this is it!  I made it exactly like the recipe stated and the only thing I would do differently is make it in a 8x8 or 9x9 pan so it's not so flat. Very easy and very tasty.. next time I might chop up a jalepeno as some other reviewers suggested.  Thanks so much for sharing this DELICIOUS recipe!

OK, i had to completely change my review on this. If you use the right kind of cornbread muffin mix, it turns out fantastic! I was looking for a really sweet cornbread, so i used Jiffy muffin mix and a little over 1/2 a cup of Splenda. Yummy!!!! It was extrememly moist (almost a little too much), and sooooo goooooood! One suggestion: Don't use Aunt Jemima Cornbread Mix, it gives it a funny taste. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!

Awesome!  It just disappears!  I've made it 3 times this week!  Yummy, moist, chewy & sweet. The best part is that THIS cornbread doesn't crumble like most...with more crumbs on your floor than on your plate.  Love it!

This is a great corn bread recipe. I did cut the sugar in half and it was plenty. I also cooked it in a 8x8 inch glass dish and cooked it for 30 minutes. My finace loved it.

I made this cornbread to serve with habanero hellfire chili also from this site and everyone really enjoyed especially the kids. The cornbread is very moist but crumbly.  I made a couple of changes. I used an 8x8 pan so it had to bake for an additional 5 minutes or so. I did not have a can of cream corn so I took a can of regular corn, drained it and put it in the blender with a couple tablespoons of heavy cream and 1 tsp of sugar. The corn tasted much better than the can cream of corn, my 19 month could not get enough of it. Lastly I took the advise of others and reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup, it was still nice, chewy and sweet.

My family loved this.  It was sweet and moist and even my five year old would eat it :).  I did double the recipe and used a 15oz. can of corn and still put it in a 9x13 pan then baked it for 40 minutes and it was perfect.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe.

AWESOME!!!  I always make dry cornbread, and this was far from it...hubby loved it too!  I added one chopped jalepeno that you couldn't even taste, and I did cut the sugar in half, but it was still super sweet and moist!  Exellent...Thanks for sharing!

Moist.  Very tasty - used a 1/4  cup sugar instead of 1/3.
Nice accompaniment for a few dishes.  Cream of corn adds another layer of texture,  while still kind of creamy nature.

Exactly what I was looking for, but it was too thin!
DON'T USE 9x12 pan!  It would be thin as a pancake!
Use 8X8 and it should turn out thick enough to cut for buttering!  I might try for muffins next time and even add jalapenos on top.

Great cornbread, very moist. I decreased the sugar to 1/4 c and will decrease it to 2TB next time. I also cooked it in an 8x8 dish, a 13x9 would only be if you doubled it in my opinion. Even the kids loved it!

This was a big hit!! After reading other reviews, I omitted the sugar entirely.  It was definitely sweet enough. The only way to make a proper cornbread, in my opinion, is in a cast iron skillet. I baked in preheated, greased skillet 350° ~20mins. It was perfect! Next time, I’m doubling this recipe! Yum!!

Very good and very easy.  I doubled everything in the recipe except for the creamed corn; it was a better thickness in a 13x9 pan doubled.

We LOVE this cornbread!  I am making it tonight with a little less milk and a little less sugar.  Normally it comes out more like a desert - which my family loves.  I'm trying to dial it back just a notch.

I made this for Superbowl and it was delicious. I took the advice of others and doubled the recipe with the exception of the sugar. I kept that to 1/4 cup. It had the perfect sweetness and complemented my chili well. I had guests asking me to make more during the party.

Made for a Thanksgiving party of 28 people. I made some minor modifications, only added approx 3tbs of white ssugar instead of the 1 cup in the recipe and added in approx 1 cup of marshmallows in with the pecans to the topping
I also baked mine in my crock from my slow cooker, that way I could put the crock into the slow cooker on low (or warm if your slow cooker has that setting) to keep warm.
It was a hit!!!

Very sweet and delicious! Took a little longer than 30 min to bake. Was still a little squishy in the middle though possibly because we didn't let it cool before cutting into. Will definitely make again! My one son insisted he doesn't like corn or corn bread... but he loved this!

WARNING: Use a 8x8 dish and not a 9x13. The taste and texture was quite good however I made the recipe exactly as require and the bread was much too thin due to the size of the dish. I like the recipe and will use it again but with the correct size dish.

This is quick and yummy!! I made a few changes after reading the reviews:
Only 1/4 cup of sugar 
1 jalapeno added with seeds.
Cook for 35 to 40 min
I don't like spicy things but the jalapeno wasn't too hot, it actually cut some of the sweetness.  This was SOOOOO good!! I'll make this again!!

I tried this recipe because I didn't realize I bought cream corn until I opened the can. I used a box of Jiffy. I did this in a 9 x 13 like it suggested and it came out super thin and complete waste of time and ingredients. Nothing like a bread. I reduced the sugar to 1/4 and it is still super  sweet.

This is so much better than the regular jiffy package directions that I think is too dry. I added a few tablespoons of honey instead of sugar. I also didn't add the canned corn because I don't like canned corn.  I also added a 1/3 cup of shredded cheese. It was so great!! I even added a few jalapenos to the adult muffins.

This got rave reviews from my family. My hubby said it was better than my mom's recipe! I doubled the recipe using two pkgs of Jiffy, and a 14.75 oz can of cream corn. I used only 1/2 of sugar (I didn't double it) though because other reviewers said it was very sweet. Because I had a little less creamed corn than the recipe calls for, it turned out more cornbread-y and less corn pudding-y (like what you may get at a Mexican restaurant). Excellent flavor and super easy.

Delicious.  Nice amount of heat.  I like my chili without beans. I did not have beer or green chiles on hand.  I just substituted water and it was fine. This one is a keeper.

Love this recipe! I double everything but the sugar and bake about 10 minutes longer than suggested. After mixing the ingredients I let the batter rest for 5-8 minutes, then re stir, before pouring into the dish. This gives a fluffy/cake like texture. Perfect every time!

I actually had to make this twice. First time I made it, the texture of the cornbread was very mushy, almost as if it were undercooked. I went back to the recipe to see where I went wrong and realized its the corn. The recipe calls for an 8 oz can however when I looked at my can of corn I realized its a 14 oz can. So I made it again, I halfed the can of corn and voila, PERFECTION ! This recipe is actually very good. I will make again.

Did not turn out at all well. :-(  9x13 pan  was WAY too big (as I suspected it would be but tried it anyway). Bread was too moist and very thin. Tasted very underdone. Maybe 2 boxes of corn muffin mix would be better( or a smaller pan and less corn) Definitely needs less sugar, maybe no extra...there is already sugar in the mix and the corn is sweet.

Love this recipe! We don't need it so sweet so will add half the sugar next time. But was a HIT with my family. Moist and delicious! Recipe is a keeper.

I made the recipe but doubled it.  2, 8 oz boxes f Jiffy 2 eggs 2/3 s cup of milk and no sugar.  Instead I used a 20 oz can of drained crushed pineapple and baked at 350 degrees for 1 hour and 15 minutes.  Moist crumbly cake that's not too sweet.

I made this as written except I poured it into an 8x8 pan.. I think the larger pan would make the cornbread too thin for my liking. Adjust cooking time accordingly.

I agree with most people; VERY moist but absolutely fantastic. Going to try making this in a cast-iron pan though next time. Spreading this in a 9x13 made it a little thin for my taste.

Super recipe!
Just be sure to double it, otherwise it's too thin.
Leave out the sugar, you don't need it!
Brought this to a chili cookout and it went faster than the chili!! :)

This recipe was quite good tasting, although I was a bit puzzled by the consistency. I did read the reviews and was expecting a soft cornbread like they warned, but it was REALLY soft. I cooked it an extra 6 minutes (I live in a high-altitude area) and it was still very soft. Honestly I wasn't sure if it was actually "done"? The outsides of the bread pulled away from the pan and were firmer, so I just went with it. The taste is nice, but I guess I prefer my cornbread in a more traditional form. I added it to the "Corn Chili" that I made from this website, so it was a delicious dinner and there was no harm done :)

I really liked this recipe.  It was very tasty and the family enjoyed it, especially the little ones.  My husband showed dismay at the amount of sugar involved and I have to agree.  In the end, I cut back just a bit, but it was still very yummy.  Will make this again and will try and reduce the sugar content.

I made this without adding the sugar and it was great and plenty sweet. Jiffy mix has sugar in it and creamed corn has sugar in it. save your waistline and leave it out. I made this in a hot buttered 10" cast iron skillet at 350 for 20 minutes and it was perfect.

It's so good!  I made double the recipe and I used brown sugar instead of white, however I did not double the sugar amount since the cream corn is already sweet. Definitely keeping this recipe!

Taste is wonderful! Quick question, did anyone refrigerate this or did it stay good covered on the counter? Never made it with creamed corn and just wondering the best way to keep it good for several days without spoiling ?

I followed the directions except I used less sugar (about 1/8 C). It was very good and very moist. I think I'd make it again and use less milk. I wanted more of a cake consistency but got a corn pudding consistency.

My family thinks this is the best cornbread ever!  I have to double the recipe (and the cooking time) because I can't find small cans of cream corn where I live. With doubling the cooking time - I need to cover the top in the last 10 minutes of cooking to keep the top at golden brown. We like it best with pulled pork and grilled chicken.

This is the best cornbread ever! My whole family loves it. I double everything except the creamed corn to make enough for 6 of us. I've also taken it to Thanksgiving dinner at my family's house and they raved about it too. Everyone wants the recipe!

Delicious cornbread! Used with "Smokin' Scovilles Turkey Chili, another great recipe from this site. It is a bit sweeter than traditional cornbread but I like it that way. The only thing I will do differently is change my bake pan. I used a 9x13 glass pyrex and I think it was a spread too thin in that. Next time I will use just a little bit smaller pan and that would be perfect!

5 stars when after I changed it up a little. My version tasted wonderful and moist. I used Jiffy corn bread mix, which is sweet enough NO sugar needed, added 1 small diced onion about 3/4 cup and 1/2 cup of diced green bell peppers, 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese,  and the rest of the listed ingredients except sugar. Baked at 400 for 15-20 minutes in a sprayed 8x8 glass pan. Came out perfect tasted wonderful with 13 bean spicy soup. I usually always change recipes to suit my southern taste and I've never had a complaint. :) Happy cooking everyone.

My boyfriend loved this recipe. I will definitely make this again. Won't use jiffy corn mix without these additions.

Different but good.  Helpful hint, do not use a 9 x 13 pan mentioned in the recipe above; the bread comes out very very thin, try a smaller 9 x 9 or 8 x 8 pan and bake longer than 30 minutes, I suggest at least 35 to 40 depending on your oven.

Very easy and delicious, but I am only giving 4 stars instead of 5 because the instructions are a little off.  I only used 1/4 cup of sugar, as others suggested, and this was more than enough.  I cannot imagine how it would taste with the full 1/2 cup.  I made muffins (I ended up with 9), but they did not rise at all - therfore, I think it would be too flat if made in a 9x13 pan.  I will definitely make again, but with less sugar, and a muffin tin or 8x8 pan.

I didn't read the directions thoroughly and added 1 14.75 oz can of creamed corn rather than 8 oz. it still came out pretty tasty- I'm guessing a little chewier than intended. I also omitted sugar and drizzled 1-2 tablespoons of honey on top before baking. It was like a special little treat biting into a thread of honey running through the bread.

Delicious, but very thin in a 9x13 pan. I would try to do this in a 9x9 next time for a longer baking time. We spooned it out of the 9x13 though and ate with a fork. Very sweet, yes... but we like that. Yum!

AMAZING! I've been searching for thus recipe for almost a month. I didn't use all the sugar suggested knowing the creamed corn is sweet. I also added 1/4 flax seed to bump up the fiber/nutrition. My picky eaters LOVED these! Will become a frequent recipe on our monthly menus. thank you!

My kids said these tasted like cornbread brownies.  While I'm sure that is considered a 5-star in their book, I'm giving it a 3.  I'm still searching for the perfect cornbread . . .

Came out pretty tasty. Cut a slice and put it right on top of my home made chili also an allrecipes recipe :-) HOWEVER I think a 13x9 pan is crazy for this small recipe. I will DEF use an 8x8 next time. Hope ya'll have good results too. Oh and it will look super soupy... comes out perfect.

I made the recipe exactly as written and it was delicious.  But I think next time I'll make it in an 8x8 pan.  Mine was thin, almost like a bar cookie, but wonderful just the same.

Made this last night to go with a Mexican chicken recipe that I have.  It had the perfect amount of sweetness to compliment the salsa on the chicken.  I halved the sugar and I made it in a smaller pan.  It took 15 minutes longer go cook as it was a little soupy in the center at 30 minutes.

I make basically the same thing, except I omit the white sugar and only add a little milk if needed.  The creamed corn seems to be enough of a liquid.  After mixing, I layer batter in a square 9" pan, put a layer of shredded cheddar cheese, then more batter, more cheese and crumbled cooked bacon.  That, with a bowl of chili can't be beat!

I've made this a few times, and it's good, though I alter it a tiny bit. I double the recipe using a 15-oz package of cornbread mix, but I only use 1/3-1/2 cup of sugar. This makes it the perfect sweetness. I also bake it in a 9" x 9" pan.

Super easy and delicious! This was very moist and sweet. If you want a dryer bread, this is not the recipe for you. I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9 X 12 pan. It was really good. The creamed corn gives it a nice sweet flavor. Will make it again.

I made this corn bread exactly as directed and sorry to say, it didn't rise one bit.  Maybe this should be how it turns out (?). I was making this for a side dish with chili and thought would be great to have moist, highly risen cornbread also. I used a glass 9x13 baking dish (don't know if that was reason for it not rising).  My friends said it was good, and it was moist but its appearance was very poor. Looking back, I shouldn't have even taken it to the party.  If I do try this recipe again, will use 2 boxes of cornbread mix.

Moist and Sweet. Since I used (3) 6.25oz pkgs and had only 1 can or cream corn, I used petite frozen corn and all came out wonderful. I did adjust the sugar to the amount of corn bread mix. I also made this 2 days ahead of time and reheated on the lowest rack on broil so it would heat up and make the tops crunchy again. I will do this again. yummy

Ok.  Between the mix, the can of cream corn and the added 1/2 cup of white sugar, this recipe has too much sugar in it!  The kids didn't complain.  I will not make this again.

Loved this recipe!! I doubled the ingredients and added two eggs. Baked at 375 for 50 minutes and it turned out PERFECT!! I didn't give it 5 stars because I think you definitely need to rinse the corn like others suggested to take away the "canned" taste. Will definitely make again!

This was a very good alternative to regular corn muffins.  The bread is very sweet and paired nicely with chili.

i had a can of cream corn that nobody would eat plain so i made this. this has all great reviews so i hate to leave a sub par one but this doesnt need a 1/2 cup of sugar i cut it in half and this came out more like cake than cornbread. sorry just not for us.

This wasn't too bad, needed to be cooked longer mine was still pretty mushy, I guess if your inlove with cream corn you'll really like this cornbread, however I love cornbread more than cream corn so I probably wouldn't waste another loaf of delicious corn bread on this...

Oh wow.  I made this tonight and it is really good!  I made it in an 8X8 pan and had to cook it for 37 minutes.  It could probably have used one more minute.  I'll be making it again I'm sure.

This was excellent. Very sweet, but that is how my family likes it. My dad liked it with plain butter, but everyone else loved it with chipotle butter. It would be great for breakfast too. Loved it!

This recipe was easy to make and tasty. The only thing I would change is to put less sugar in the mix. The bread tasted too sweet for my family's taste.

Fantastic corn bread! All the cornmeal taste and bread texture that you want out of cornbread, but also so deliciously moist and saturated with more corn flavor than most cornbreads.

DELICIOUS!! I remember having this as a child and have been looking for a recipe every since. I had no idea it was as easy as adding some cream corn and sugar to a batch of Jiffy mix. It came out soooooo moist and sweet. I also served it with honey butter as another review suggested... mmmmmmm good.

I have made a dish similiar to this before but couldn't find the recipe for it, so I turned to Allrecipes.com for help and this recipe best fit the one I had used in the past.  I followed other reviewers advice and cut back on the sugar, using a little less than 1/4 cup.  I added some jarred jalapenos and onions that I finely chopped. I cooked my in a slightly smaller dish than the recipe called for, thus cooking it about 7 minutes more.  Elewise I followed the recipe as written.  Very tasty, will add to my collection.

I found this recipe at the beginning of the summer and it is hands-down my favorite cornbread! I've taken it to graduation parties, picnics, camp-outs and make it at least once a week to accompany dinner...my husband could eat a pan of it himself! Everyone that I've served it to wants the recipe(and 2nds although there usually isn't enough!)

The only change I made to the original recipe is putting the batter into a smaller pan...that way it comes out thicker!

Very moist and delicious. I omitted the sugar and added some diced jalapeno. I would bake in a square pan next time, I used an 11x7 and the cornbread came out quite thin. Will definitely make again.

WOW! I was afraid that this was going to be TOO moist - like a side of creamed corn or something. I didn't know what to expect - but it was PERFECT. I added just under 1/2c sugar and it was just right. I will use this for all of my BBQ's and corn bread recipes.

I loved this corn bread. I wasn't to thrilled with the chunks of corn, so I think I will make sure I put the cream  corn in to a blender first( just to really get a smooth consistence), and I also used the hole amount of sugar. As I like sweat corn bread. All in All this was a really good recipe.

This is an excellent and very easy recipe. Though, it is called 'cornbread,' it really should be called 'corncake.' The recipe comes out sweet and moist, just like a good pan cake.

As noted by numerous others, I decreased the amount of sugar to 1/3 cup. It was plenty sweet. 

I made this recipe recently for a side dish at a Chili dinner. I increased the size by 5x, baked it in a chafing pan and increased the time to 1 hour. I got numerous recipe requests that night for this.

I served this and I learned that people loved this or hated it because it's quite different from a traditonal cornbread. I used a can of sweetened creamed corn,so it really didn't need more sugar (maybe a sprinkle). I baked this in a 8x8 square dish to have thicker pieces and this worked out great.

I accidentally used a 14.5 oz can of cream corn instead of the 8 oz.  The cornbread still turned out fabulous, albeit a little bit moist.  I used an 8x8 pan, as suggested by other reviews, and Jiffy cornbread mix.  I like sweet cornbread, so I stuck with the 1/2 cup of sugar.  This is a great cornbread recipe!

This was AWESOME! I got so many compliments - I did double the recipe and reduce the sugar like other reviewers suggested, and I loved it. Moist, dense, but didn't fall apart. Perfect!!

Delicious!  I used an 8x8 pan instead of the 9x13 the recipe calls for and cut the sugar in 1/2 (used 1/4 cup).  I will be making this again!

This was very easy to make.  I served it with chili.  I didn't think it had a very strong corn flavor.  I'll stick with making my cornbread from scratch.
