I made this with frozen rhubarb that had been in my freezer forever. I didn't thaw the rhubarb before putting it into the recipe. It came out amazing. Very juicy, sweet and sour. I served it with vanilla ice cream. Extremely simple to make!

Great recipe! A perfect balance of sweet and sour. I substituted 1 cup of frozen strawberries for 1 cup of rhubarb for a Crumb-Topped Rhubarb & Strawberries. It added a bit more fruitiness and balanced out the sour of the rhubarb. I also added a few more tablespoons of flour to the fruit to thicken it up a bit. Yum!

This was incredible!  I have tried many rhubarb recipes and this is the best.  I brought this to a friend's house and everyone loved it!  Like another reviewer, I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9x13 pan and it turned out so good.  This is served best straight out of the oven with vanilla bean ice cream or heavy cream.  Thanks for the recipe.

Yummy. And easy, too!  Baked in a 9"x9" pan based on other reviews.  I've made this several times, sometimes adding sliced apples or strawberries.  Next time, I think  I'll toss pecans or almonds in the topping.

This is very good- it is a little more tart than a typical rhubarb crumble- not so sickeningly sweet. It is not so heavy on the topping either. At first I was disappointed that there wasn't enough topping to cover all the rhubarb, but found after it was baked that it was perfect. Just enough rhubarb and just enough topping. This is a keeper- the whole family raved over it.

The only thing I did different to this recipe was I cooked it in a 8 x 8 pan.  I didn't change a thing otherwise.  Perfect!  I loved it!

This was very good!  Not too sweet.  Next time I will add more rhubarb or cook in a 9x9 pan.  I also used frozen rhubarb.  It took 60 minutes to bake.

Wonderful and easy recipe. I added some chopped walnuts to the topping for a little extra crunch. Turned out great!

It's OK but was way too sweet for our liking. Three cups of rhubarb is not enough for a 12x8 dish. We used a 9x9 and the layer of rhubarb was still very thin. Definitely needs more rhubarb. Thanks for posting it Betty but we will keep on looking for one that better suits our taste.

Delicious and super easy to make. I did not alter the recipe, but would double it the next time I make it. It's great plain, but even better with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Betty - thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

I would give this 4.5.  It was easy to make, and the flavor was great.  I doubled the recipe and cut my rhubarb up small, so it fit into a 9X13 pan easily.  What I really liked about it was that there wasn't as much butter used as normal crumbles, in fact, I used a few tablespoons less butter than asked, and it still cooked perfect.  I will make again.

I have made this recipe twice now.   I increased the rhubarb by a cup so that it covered the entire pan.  I also mixed the flour, sugar, cinnamon and salt together in a separate bowl and instead of mixing it with the rhubarb, I put the rhubarb in the pan first and then sprinkled the mixture over the rhubarb.  
Both times that I've made this recipe it didn't last more than a day and has become a family favorite.

I made changes but it was very good. Used 5 cups of rhubarb, used splenda white in the rhubarb and splenda brown in the topping. I increased the splenda a little bit (to somewhere between 1/2 cup and 3/4 cup). I also added more oats in the topping than it called for.

This was my first time ever tasting rhubarb, and this was GREAT! It was sweet and tart, great with ice cream. My only comment would be that I thought this amount of fruit was pretty scanty, so I will double the fruit but leave the topping the same next time, and I baked this in an 8x8 dish. Thanks for sharing!

This was excellent, tart yet sweet.  I think the oats really added to the topping.

This was delicious!  We doubled it and used whole wheat flour, a little less sugar, a little more oats (old-fashioned kind)..that was just what we had on hand.  It worked out great!!  Will definitely make again.

The topping is great for any fruit combination. I think the pan size given in the recipe is off. No way is 3 cups of fruit going to cover a 12x8. I made it with 2 cups of frozen rhubarb and 2 cups of frozen strawberries in a 9x9 and the fruit layer was still pretty thin. Will use this as my regular fruit crisp recipe, but increase the amount of fruit.

This is very good even with Splenda instead of sugar and Splenda's brown sugar blend instead of brown sugar. Everything else I followed exactly. I thought the crumb to rhubarb ratio was too high, though, especially with the way the rhubarb cooks down. I think you can get away with using just 1/2 to 3/4 of the crumb topping. Served with vanilla ice cream. Yum!

Perfect As-Is, no changes.  (Unless you want to count doubling the recipe and preparing in a 13X9 as a change ).  This is going to the top of my list of rhubarb recipes.  Easy and DELISH!

Great flavor. Next time make in 8X8 pan as others have suggested. Maybe less topping so it won't be so thick. Adding strawberries sounds like a treat for next time.

I have several rhubarb recipes that are similar but I like the cinnamon addition in this one!  It has great flavor.  I might cut down some on the white sugar next time to give it a little more tang.  It, or my rhubarb, was pretty mild and I like some tang to it along with the sweetness.  I am actually trying to get away from sugar but I had to have some springtime rhubarb!

Yum! I read the reviews and made it in an 8x8 pan instead of a 12x8 and it worked out great. The recipe is just sweet enough to cut the tartness of the rhubarb without completely masking it as some recipes do. Will hang on to this one. Update: I've also made this using apples and that works great too!

I've made this several times this season and it's a tremendous hit. This is the best, tastiest use of rhubarb! Fast and easy! Hubby gives it 5 stars too. I used a few TBL's more sugar is all. Rhubarb is quite tart and the little extra sugar was just right for us.

I really liked the different topping used in this recipe, found it crisper and crunchier and enjoyed the contrast of that with the soft rhubarb.  I did, however, double the amount of rhubarb and added almost a cup of fresh raspberries as part of the mix, and piled it into my 9x7 deep dish glass casserole, using the same amount of topping ingredients as are in the recipe.  This was very special indeed, whether topped with good vanilla ice cream or whipped cream.  I sprinkled a little extra cinnamon on top before baking, and it filled my whole kitchen with a wonderful aroma!  My favorite use of rhubarb EVER!

Amazing!  I picked this recipe over other rhubarb crips because it seemed to have less sugar and butter.  To make it healthier I used whole wheat flour and flax seed instead of white flour in the topping.  I also added some sliced almonds.  It turned out so good!  Not to sweet, not too buttery.  I served it heated with vanilla ice cream and we just gobbled it up!

First time I've ever made anything with rhubarb.  Fast and easy recipe.  I adjusted the quantities to serve 8 and used a 9x9 pan.  Served it right from the oven with vanilla ice cream - wonderful!

I thought that this was really too sour!  I made for a party without trying first, and about 3/4 of it was left-over.  I followed the directions exactly, other than adding in 1 cup of sliced peaches.  It's just too much rhubarb for us, I guess!  I still gave it 3 stars because if someone truly loved, loved rhubarb they may like this.

Very good, and I also added strawberry to the rhubarb for a sweeter flavor. I ended up with more than 3 cups of fruit, but as it turned out I wish I had prepared more fruit for the pan I used (which was actually slightly smaller than suggested). Next time I also may add more brown sugar to the crust to balance the oatmeal taste. Tip--a cup of diced rhubarb equates to one large stalk of rhubarb.

This is sooooo good-I added some strawberries & I might broil it for a bit next time to crispen up the top a little.  Serve with ice cream or cool whip.

A great use for rhubarb from the garden. I only had 2 cups of rhubarb (it looked like more until I picked it) so I added a cup of fresh raspberries. Cut the cinnamon in half because it seemed like too much for the amount of filling and I was afraid of ruining it. Served with French vanilla ice cream. Thanks!

Pretty good. I doubled the recipe and replaced two of the cups of rhubarb with mixed berries. If I make it again, the only thing I'll do differently is to add more rhubarb and berries and less of the topping (as parts of it were very thick).

This turned out delicious.  I increased the rhubarb (I used fresh) by 1 cup; cut down the sugar to 1/3 cup; add juice of one lemon to rhubarb mixture.  The crumb topping was great, although I think I will add almonds to this next time.  Great recipe, super easy, wonderful with ice cream.  I will make this again!

This rhubarb crumble is so yummy it doesn't even need the extra calories and fat from cream or ice cream.  I followed the recipe except to add an additional half-pint of raspberries and pint of blueberries.  The sweetness from these berries combined with the tartness of the rhubarb and the subtle crunch of the topping are really heavenly together!  Also was a beautiful colour when cooked. Thanks for a great rhubarb recipe!

Really really good.  We had too much food for dinner so I didnt serve it for dessert, but when company left the husband and I stood in the kitchen and started ... and couldnt stop ... and that was without ice-cream! It came out a bit thin, so I think next time I will add some more rhubarb and use a smaller dish.

Excellent taste. I used an 8x8 dish as per other recommendations, but it makes the topping a bit too thick. I think next time I'll use the intended size but add another cup of rhubarb. I also added a little cinnamon and nutmeg to both the filling and the crumb topping.

I had never had rhubarb before. Thought this had to be good with everyone giving it 5 stars.  It is SO good. I only had 1 cup of rhubarb so I divided everything in third. Only problem is I didnt have enough to eat. It turned out very yummy but only 3 servings. I want more! Its so good. Now I will have to make it again.

This was a wonderful and simple recipe, the cinnamon really makes it nice and it goes great with vanilla ice cream

This is an awesome recipe!  I added three cups of cut-up strawberries, baked it in a round stoneware pan.  It cooled overnight and we had it warmed-up in the microwave the next day (about 20 sec. a serving). Anyone who likes rhubarb will love this recipe.  A terrifice summer dessert!
