This was wonderful. I used chicken breasts and thighs instead of wings, and the aroma while it was cooking drove the whole family crazy with anticipation.  A very savory dish and one I will be making again and again.

This came out excellent.  I didn't have any tomato soup, just used a can of tomato paste watered down.  Also didn't have any tumeric so I substituted with onion and garlic sazon.  For the rice, I used whole cloves and subbed the almonds for craisins.  I also used basmati and the rice came out subtle sweet. Overall, I loved the dish and it was easy to make.  Next time I might try to make the chicken in a slow cooker.

Very delicious recipe! I used chicken drum sticks as I did not have any wings available and just plain white rice since I was out of Tumeric. Added some of the extra sauce to the rice. This dish was a hit in my family! Very flavourful and easy to prepare. Will definitely be making this one again.

Our family enjoyed this recipe and it was very easy to fix.  I didn't have the cayenne so I can't say that I followed it exactly.  I used chili powder instead.  Still very good, especially over the rice.  Thanks for this recipe.

This was a great recipe!  My wife and I used it for chicken breasts instead of wings and it worked great!  I forgot to cover the pan, so the sauce didn't work out so well and it dried onto the chicken, but I spooned what was on the bottom of the pan over the chicken and that went a long way.  Used brown rice for the the rice dish.  It was okay.  Will probably use again.
