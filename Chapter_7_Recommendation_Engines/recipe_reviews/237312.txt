OK so I followed the directions as best I could, I didn't have everything on hand.  I used wheat floor for white.  I didn't have applesauce so I used 1c. vegetable shortening.  I know I know less healthy but it was that or nothing so..  I also used canned peaches and dried craisins being as it's winter and good luck finding those fresh!  It was a little dry probably because of the wheat flour.  It looked like bread dough instead of muffin batter so I added the juice from the peaches in 1/4c increments until it was better.  Filled silicone cups 3/4 full.  Baked at 375* for 35 min (again probably because it was denser with wheat flour) and voila!  These were very pretty, moist, delicious family treats!  Thanks!!

Turned out very moist with good flavor.  Subs:  1 3/4 C Dark Brown Sugar for the White Sugar and 1 C Applesauce (instead of 1/3/4 C) + 1/4 C Veg. Oil

It is probably dry because this recipe is low in fats.
