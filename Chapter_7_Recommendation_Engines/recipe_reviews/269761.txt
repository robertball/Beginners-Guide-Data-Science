Instead of serving it cold I served it hot.   I put pasta on top added ricotta cheese and bake for 30 minutes.  Added Marinara and made my own version of eggplant Parmesan. Potluck delicious

I substituted 1 tsp dried dill for the parsley, and skipped the cooling down part after sampling it fresh out of the oven (and it didn't take very long to cool down to edible temperature).  It tasted great by itself or topped with parmesan  cheese.

Absolutely delicious and very easy. I added Kalamata olives and feta cheese to mine the day after and served it with roasted pork. Love it!

Excellent eggplant dish!  Good hot or cold.  I used multi colored peppers and a can of diced tomatoes rather than fresh. I also added a can of drained chickpeas, oregano and basil.

I love the vegetables in this recipe and it’s pretty simple to make but the end result is watery and not crispy. I’m sure it’s something I may have done wrong but I won’t make this recipe again.
