This was OK and does come together very quickly.  Bok choy on its own doesn’t have a whole lot of flavor, so if I were to make again, I would take the recipe author’s suggestion and add some chicken soup base to give it some more flavor.

Quick and easy. I substituted chicken stock for the water, added a little sesame oil in addition to the olive oil and a whole lot of red pepper flakes.
