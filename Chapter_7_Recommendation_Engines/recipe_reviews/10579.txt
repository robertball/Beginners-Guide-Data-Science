I ended up with 76 cookies; baked them 7 1/2 minutes. They're very good. I omitted the nuts & tossed in an extra scant 1/2 cup of oats. Next time I'll try vanilla instead of almond extract. I would recommend letting the dough sit for 10 minutes or so before making your cookies. I found that the dough was easier to work with as I went along, because the oats were absorbing liquid.

These turned out great! After reading that a few of these leaked through the bottom, I made mine a bit bigger by rolling them into 3" balls then making  a more shallow hole, rather than a deep thumbprint. I used cherry, blueberry, and strawberry jam for mine, and all three kinds worked really well. I also used all shortening (ran out of butter...) This is definitly a keeper!

This is an excellent cookie! I made it last Christmas for the first time and my husband insisted that I make them again this year. I use more jam than called for, but everything else I do as the recipe says. 
Only problem is I keep calling them "jum thambprints"!

This was such a good recipe.  Makes soft, chewy cookies and my daughter was helping make the indentations and putting the filling in.  They taste wonderful!  This recipe is a keeper! Stores well, also! We are hooked!

I would have given these three stars, however my family likes these, so I will go four stars.  The oatmeal cookie part is very dry after baking, and the almond extract seems out of place in an oatmeal cookie.  If I attempt these again, I will use vanilla extract instead of the almond.

I tweaked this a bit. My oatmeal cookies tend to turn out too thin so I used cake flour instead and I increased the amount by 1 cup or so. I also used milk rather than water, omited the nuts entirely since I have small children, and I also used rolled oats that I pulsed slightly in the food processor so that they were fuller than minute oats but not as big as rolled oats. I also used butter flavored shortening entirely rather than the mix of butter/shortening called for in the recipe...and strawberry jam because it was what we had an abundance of. They turned out great but I will probably use 1/2 cake flour and q/2 all purpose next time for a less cakey cookie but hopefully not too thin.

Sorry, but I wasn't crazy about these.  They turned out more "cake-like" than my taste prefers.  I also had a hard time with the dough.  It was so moist and sticky that I couldn't put a thumbprint in the middle.  I let some of the dough sit in the fridge for a bit and that helped, but still wasn't easy to work with.

I had never made thumbprint cookies before. They were very easy and very good. My friend came over and we made a whole bunch of homemade Jam, and I wanted to use some in a fun way. What a great cookie with the jam. Thankyou so much. We are making apricot jam tomorrow and I will be making these cookies again to go along with that jam!

The dough was really tasty! I used pecans in the middle instead of jam. My sister used the leftover dough to make an oatmeal bar with raisins and nuts and peanut butter in the middle of 2 layers of oatmeal cookie dough and that was great! A lot of ingredients but a really great flavor!

Everybody in my family loved these cookies. They were easy to make too. I got about 7 dozen cookies out of this recipe, needless to say, I needed more than the list 1/4 cup preserves. I will make these again (and again)and will try different types of preserves. It's a keeper!

I made these cookies by omitting almond extract and used vanilla, instead.  

As for taste, these cookies are AMAZING.  However they are extremely difficult to make.  

To make the indent, I sprayed the end of a wooden spoon and used that.  Again, difficult to get an indent deep enough to hold jam and shallow enough to not leak through during baking. 

They are also very cake-like in texture which makes them difficult to store.  I waited until they cooled completely, and tried to place them in an airtight container.  The cookies began to stick, break, etc.  I eventually placed parchment between the layers in a 9x13 in pan and that seemed to work, but is not ideal for storage.  

I love the taste but probably won't make these again.

This recipe is one of my favorite cookies to make around the holidays.  I do not alter the recipe, and I like to use blackberry and raspberry jam.  So good. Thank you for the recipe.

The batter was not firm enough for thumbprints, although I made a few.  It is a good recipe for a soft plain oatmeal cookie, however, if that's what you want.  They spread nicely on the baking sheet.  I only made half the recipe and had plenty of cookies--about 2 dozen.  I also dropped the oven temp to 350 and baked for 10 minutes, as we like soft chewy cookies.

Not too crazy about this recipe.  I too found the dough way too sticky and goopy to work with,  Also, the cookies spread out way too thin and the jam oozed through the bottom.  Maybe I did something wrong...maybe more oats or nuts next time, though it's unlikely I will make these again.  Not worth the time and effort.

Im not sure what I did wrong but my dough was sticky and thin. Could not make thumbprints. When cookies baked, the jam ran off and fell through bottom.

These are easy to make. To avoid sticky dough just let it sit for 10 minutes before you drop them. It wasn't even as sticky as I thought it would be from reading reviews. I dropped one star because they just weren't oatmeal enough for me. They're delicious and everyone has loved them but I'm not too crazy about them.

These cookies are drier and cakier than I would prefer. The flavor is like an oaty bread with jam and a hint of cinnamon--still yummy if you have a sweet tooth.  My suggestion would be to decrease the flour and add butter. I tweaked the recipe using all shortening/no butter, more jam (thank goodness, it helped moisten it), vanilla extract instead almond, no nuts, and old-fashioned oats but I don't think those changes made it bready.  Regardless, we still ate 'em up.
