I am the submitter off this recipe and I now use Stevia in place of the sugar. Just as tasty and refreshing with less calories. Hope you enjoy!

My son wanted to make this so I supervised him in the kitchen while he put this together. He says he would make this over and over again!

I used frozen blueberries rather than fresh and stevia rather than sugar. I decided to strain it but didn't strain very many seeds out, so it probably wasn't necessary. This was a delicious and refreshing drink.

This stuff is addictive! I used agave syrup instead of sugar reducing the amount as well.  Thank you for the recipe!

I liked it. I  made half the amount and used twice the lime juice. I froze some  in an ice cube tray for later.

I found the blueberry limeade to be quite watered down.  I ended up adding about 50% more blueberries and lime juice and it was still watery.
