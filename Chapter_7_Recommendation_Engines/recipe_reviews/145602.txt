This was delicious.  I'm really surprised, however, that no one questioned the 2 Tablespoons of Baking Powder.  That can't be right can it?  I put in 2 teaspoons and it still ran over the sides of the dish.  Now, mayber I should have used a bigger dish because I didn't use a 9x13.  I've never made anything that had 2 tablespoons of Baking Powder though.  I'll try it again in a 9x13 with 2T and see what happens.  No matter though, gonna rate this 5 stars because it was delicious!

Also added blueberries to the dough, but didn't have any raspberries! As an additional alteration, I used Splenda Brown Sugar blend in the peach & cinnamon mix.  We could eat this morning, noon and night!

Very tasty! Made it just as directed. It as a little dry, but that may have been because I had to use frozen peaches and didn't let them sit out enough. Will try to make them more syrupy next time. But the flavor was delicious.GREAT sugar free recipe!

This is quick and easy to put together. I was skeptical about the amount of butter melted in the dish, but it really baked into the dough and made it absolutely scrumptious! I halved the recipe and used an 8x8 baking dish. Mine was completely baked in 38 minutes as a result. I served this with vanilla ice cream and Raspberry Sauce from Allrecipes. Delicious!

Excellent cobbler
I added blueberries and allspice to the dough. It was outstanding.

I like this because it's sweet but not too sweet.  I also used Splenda Brown sugar blend for the base and white sugar blend with the fruit.  I was feeling lazy that night so I used frozen sliced peaches and frozen mixed berries, letting the bags thaw in hot water before dumping them out into a bowl and adding the sugar, cinnamon, lemon juice and I also added a couple of dashes of nutmeg as well.    It's a simple cobbler recipe that's easy to make and tastes great whether you use fresh or frozen fruit.

Ok - WHAT DID I DO WRONG? Never again....made this with apples instead of peaches.  Dry, tough, yucky "artificial" taste. Really poor option for low cal, sugar free eating.
