Made this for Recipe Group...We LOVED these! Made as written, except for adding some garlic powder to the potatoes, along w/ the salt and pepper while they were baking, and flipping them 1/2 way through, so they would brown evenly. They were great as is, but I think next time I will add some green onions and maybe a bit of salsa or taco sauce to the top as well, just for a little something extra. What a fun twist... I will def be making these again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was pretty good.  Didn't have black beans, so used refried beans in this.  Also cut the potatoes to 1/4" thickness instead of 1/2", as we wanted the potatoes to stretch a little further and be thinner and crispier.  Added a little chili powder to the potatoes, too, when baking.  Nice flavour and texture to this meal.

My family loved this dinner! It was quick to make and a fun new way to make nachos. I used ground turkey and a packet of chicken taco seasoning. This recipe is a keeper.

This recipe is really, really good!  The usual skeptics in my house had second helpings of this (along with a side of "their words")!  Everyone in my house thought these were better than traditional nachos with chips!  I used regular russet potatoes and I sliced them pretty thin using a mandolin.  I only baked them for 15 min. since they were thin.  Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe, lois!!

I made this recipe as part of the recipe weekly group selection. We loved having nachos over potatoes, what a great change from tortilla chips. I sliced my potatoes 1/4 in. thin added some taco seasoning spices to them along with olive oil. We grilled them on a cookie sheet on our gas grill over indirect heat at 425° since we try not to use the oven in the dead of summer. We turned the potatoes after ten minutes and cooked 5 to 10 more minutes. Great meal and so easy to prepare...a new favorite for us. Thanks lois.

I made this for Recipe Group and it was a fun recipe to try.  I did make some minor changes.  With the 8 oz. of ground beef I made my usual taco meat and added 1/2 a can of black beans.  I didn’t measure the rest of the ingredients, just used what I thought looked right, adding green onions.  I didn’t have guacamole, so I served this with chunky salsa, along with the sour cream.  While I thought this was good, halfway through dinner, I found myself eating the toppings with tortilla chips and leaving the potatoes behind on the plate.  Who knows?  Maybe I was getting full.  I have some of the meat/bean mixture leftover that I will use on a taco salad tomorrow night!

Really great twist on your usual nachos.  I am a vegetarian so I didn't use any beef.  Other than that I followed the recipe and found it to be very filling; this could easily be a filling dinner. I definitely recommend trying this one. Thanks for sharing!

I actually made this tonight after getting the email. It was quick and super easy... My husband is always my judge when it comes to new recipes and he liked it a lot...saying he would defiantly eat it again..even suggested black olives might be good mixed in... ;)

Recipe Group Selection:  04, August 2012 ~ Nice selection this week.  I prepared the potatoes with a different cooking method.  Our grill was lit and rather than heat the oven to 425 degrees, we just grilled the potatoes.  I still covered with oil, s/p and grilled for about 5 minutes per side until the potatoes were at desired doneness.  Topped with the other ingredients (minus the guacamole, didn't have any) they were enjoyed and devoured by my hubby and son.

Yeah, the picture looks great, and I was looking for comfort food and something fun for the family. However as I mixed together the beans and meat it looked like...something inedible. I felt bad serving it to my sons, who ate it politely. Sorry.

I think traditional nachos are the way to go. Potatoes don't have the same *crunch* no matter how long you roast them. The hot bean and meat mixture makes the potatoes soft and indistinguishable. It's like beans on top of giant beans with bits of ground beef here and there. Get the picture? 

Keeping the beans and beef separated might improve the recipe. In addition, I'd nix the taco seasoning, and add just a little chili powder and salt to the ground beef.

Love this recipe! The baking time for the potato slices was perfect. I essentially made the meal with what I had on hand using a homemade black bean and roasted corn salsa in the place of the canned black beans, cotija cheese and shredded leftover chuck roast. I also set the toppings out for people to "build" their own nachos. Worked out really well. Thank you, Lois. I'll be making this again.

I made these for my 11 year old because he likes all foods with a south west flair.  I tweaked a bit because I wanted to use what I had in the pantry.  Instead of baked potatoes, I used 2.5lbs red potatoes that I cooked in the microwave then sliced and spread onto baking sheet.  I seasoned the meat/bean mixture using homemade taco seasoning (Recipe from this site).  I used shredded cheddar montrey jack blend.  My son really enjoyed these.  I think they would have tasted even better with baked potatoes but I needed to use the potatoes I had on-hand.  Thank you lois for the recipe.:)

This was enjoyed by the Family but they didn't rave about it. I think next time I think I will try to get more crispness to potatoes. I did slice in food processor to about 1/8 in thick --- half inch would have been too thick for my tastes. Thanks for the recipe and idea!

Recipe Group selection 8/4/12.  I loved the concept, so much less waste than with loaded potato skins.  I prepared my potatos a little differently, slicing them about 1/8", tossing with the oil, S&P, garlic and chili powder then nuking them until just short of crisp.  I followed the recipe from that point.  I think the next time I will add chopped onion to the meat and some garlic and add jalapeno pepper rings to the toppings.  Thanks, Lois this is a fun recipe.

I plan to try this weekend but a suggestion to keep your potatoes from sticking to the cookie sheet. Good old fashioned shortening. I just grab a paper towel, slip on a bit of shortening, rub onto the cookie sheet and potatoes wont stick. It works better than the new line of spary-on non-stick cans that seem to ruin all my pans.

Very Good--I made it lik a casserole-first doing the potatoes as stated, then layering left over taco meat and a little cheese.  Put back in the oven until the meat was heat thru-then served on plates for our kids and the topped like nachos with their favorites--VERY YUMMY!!!!!

This dish was delicious.  I had made already ground meat two days ago (picadillo) and I put the potatoes in the oven 1/4" thick and glazed them with cooking spray salt and pepper.  5 min on each side when done I spread the ground meat that I had mixed with a can of blk beans.  Topped with cheese and very thin onion slices.  Lettuce, sour cream, guacamole, and salsa topped with crushed Doritos.  My son ate 3 servings.  Thanks for the recipe :)

This recipe sounds AWESOME.  I will be making it but will be altering the recipe slightly.  We're not huge fans of the refried beans so going to leave them out and I'm allergic to tomatoes so going to replace with Jalapeno peppers and another veggie.  Otherwise will be made exactly as the recipe calls for.  Any other suggestions to replace the beans would be helpful.

We really liked this. It was VERY filling with the beans, and the guac on top. We made with vegetarian meat and never missed the beef.

Very good 'Comfort Food' and easy.  Basically like tacos on potatoes but still a good twist. Use LOTS of fresh veggies.  You will like it!  We used a smoked salsa (available at any grocery store; Jardine's?)and it was terrific.

This was very good! I omitted the beef and added 2 cups of cooked rice to make it a vegitarian dish. A very unique approach to the standard taco salad. Thanks for sharing!

These were VERY good. Made recipe just as written. A very nice change from the tortilla chip nacho. I used too much oil and my potatoes didn't brown, so I put them under the broiler for a few minutes.

What a wonderful, versatile recipe!   Have enjoyed the recipe made per directions (other than slicing potatoes 1/3" with mandolin for nice thin slices that cook well).  
I have also made great "nachos" by throwing together bits and pieces of flavorful leftovers (carnitas and chili beans once, leftover texas cavier and avocado slices another, veggie chili was good as well).  
I like that the potatoes are hearty and filling and make the dish go a long way on a budget.  One big baking potato filled my full size baking sheet with 20 nice uniform slices.

Great recipe when I had some potatoes I needed to use up.   Will be a good one when my grandson comes to spend a few weeks here in the summer. I did add some  onion to ground meat.

My family liked this a lot.  I was worried with all the black beans because I'm not a big fan.  But it had really good flavor.

This was excellent. My hubby and I gobbled it up! I read a bunch of the reviews, and then did it like this: I peeled the potatoes, and sliced them between 1/4 and 1/2" thick. I used enough to cover the bottom of a 9x13 glass pan. I swirled the potatoes with more than a tbsp of oil, laid them out in the pan, and sprinkled with the pepper and salt. I baked them for longer than 10 minutes--probably about 20 minutes. They were starting to brown on the top--perfect! It made the recipe taste a little like a smothered bake potato. I used a pound of meat, and a whole packet of low sodium taco seasoning in the meat/beans mixture, and skipped the oil. (However, I didn't use the whole meat mixture in the recipe; there were leftovers for tomorrow.) I used a cheddar/jack mix, as someone recommended. For toppings, I used lettuce, tomatoes, salsa, sour cream, black olives and no heat (jarred) jalapeños. Unfortunately I didn't have avocado/guac on hand. Delicious! A definite keeper. And BTW, I don't give out a lot of 5 star reviews. Thanks for sharing!  

PS-It would be nice to be able to add reviews from my ipad (which is what I use in the kitchen). Why won't it take my stars?!

My first time making this and I'm hoping for a nice outcome. ;) I'll most likely try it without the meat. I'm always looking for new recipes to try. 

Thanks.

Great recipe.  My family loved it.  Make sure to season the potatos and flip them half way through to crisp both sides. This is a keeper.

Made this for my husband and I for Superbowl Sunday. Oh my goodness; we loved it! The only difficult thing was not eating the whole thing! I added more tomatoes and lettuce than called for and used fresh sliced avacado. Yum.

We tripled the recipe as my husband didn't think it would be enough for a main dish.  We will be eating left overs for the next week. I did do as someone suggested and flipped my potatoes but I did follow the recipe as is.  This is a keeper.  We put the sour cream, guacamole, and salsa on the side as well as jalapeño pepper slices and olives as my daughter isn't a pepper or olive fan.

These were different ... I'm glad I tried the recipe, but I - well, it's just not for us.  They're not bad by any means - but as someone pointed out, they're just so heavy and there's no crunch or texture.  I felt like I was eating leftover chili wedge fries.  They were much improved once you added the tomatoes, sour cream, and guac ... but I think I'd just as soon use the mixture on baked tortilla chips as opposed to potatoes.  Thanks so much for recipe.  Update:  in retrospect, I did make sure to cut potatoes 1/2" thick ... I've leftover meat mixture and may try again tonight cutting them to 1/4" thickness as MissKitty suggested.

Made this for the Super Bowl last night to use up some potatoes we had on hand.  This was great!  Swapped out olive oil for the vegetable oil to roast the potatoes and cut the potatoes about a 1/4 inch thick to get them crispier.  I didn't use oil to brown the ground beef.  After layering the cheese, beef/bean mixture, and remaining cheese, we stuck this under the broiler for 2-3 minutes before adding the remaining toppings.  Thanks for sharing this creative recipe!

Made this tonight for the Super Bowl and everyone (even the kids) liked it.  It has been requested for dinner another night soon.  I cut the potatoes into 1/4 inch slices as I think 1/2 would be too thick.  At 1/4 inch you have to be careful picking them up but they work without falling apart.  Thanks for the recipe.

My oh my!!!! My son was recently diagnosed with a corn allergy and a gluten sensitivity. So I've been looking for some alternative recipes.  He absolutely loves anything to do with tortilla chips.  I didn't have quite everything on hand for this recipe. . . so although I tried to stay close to the recipe. . .I added about half a can of canned tomatoes and half a can of diced green chilis, in order to increase the veggie quotient. I also slice the potatoes much thinner but the overall base recipe was a home run.  My family has requested that I add this to our dinner rotation.  Cudos!!!!

Made this recipe the other night and loved it! Definitely use the ground beef and possibly a side of veggies because it's a lot of effort for just a nacho appetizer...might as well make it a meal!

This recipe is great!  I did make a few minor changes.  We try to limit our salt intake, so I used low-sodium black beans (Bush's) and added a bit of sauted onion and a little fresh chopped cilantro while browning the 96%lean ground chuck.  I also sprinkled some chopped cilantro on top just before serving.  Very yummy!

I made this for my family tonight and they really liked it. I did use a whole pound of hamburger and added a taco seasoning mix just like we do for tacos. I then added green onions to the hamburger with the black beans (about 1/4 cup). Served it with sour cream, lettuce, tomatoes, and olives. It was it was a big hit!

Very good.  We topped the potatoes with my Mexican chicken mixture instead.  I didn't have Veg. oil so I used olive oil and as someone else had mentioned I sprinkled with salt, pepper and garlic powder.  Very easy and tasty too.

Delicious!  I should have followed the recipe's advice on the thickness of the potatoes and cut them at .5".  Instead I followed the advice of reviewers and cut them thinner.  They stuck to the cookie sheet (even though coated nicely in oil) and were too toasty.  I used turkey and added a full packet of taco seasoning to add more flavor.

As much as I tried to crisp the potatoes and keep them uniform, some of them turned out floppy and some were burnt.  I coated the bottom of the pan and they still stuck.  I guess I'd rather just use nacho chips from now on.

I made it per the recipe. My husband & I both thought it was “ok”. I had leftover meat/bean mixture so I made it the next night using mashed potatoes for the base instead of the fried potatoes. Loved it!  5 Stars.

I absolutely loved this dish!  The potatoes as a layer in this taco style dish, paired really well together.  Honestly if you wanted to go full vegetarian and leave the meat out of this, I think it would be great too, but would season the potatoes with the taco seasoning to get the taco flavor.  I pretty much went by the recipe but didn't have an avocado for guacamole, so I made some fresh black bean, corn, and tomato pico de gallo to go on top.  I did cut the potatoes thinner and cooker longer to get a nice crust on the outside but still soft in the middle.  About 30 min in the oven.  I do think next time I will chunk the potatoes up differently into smaller bites to eat with a fork better.  Also I put cheese on top of the potatoes to melt in the oven the last min. and piled more cheese on top to melt when pulling out.  Served it with lettuce, tomato, the black bean & corn pico, sour cream, green onions, and some taco sauce or salsa and it made a delicious hearty meal for two.  Thank you for the recipe, I will be making this again!

I could only make this stretch into 4 meals, not 8. It tasted great and I always use ground turkey instead of beef. Not sure I'll make it again, but it was good overall.

I made this for the first time in 2013. I had to put the black beans in in secret. I knew DH would complain! We about died when we tried it! Soooo good!
The next time I made it, my husband was in the kitchen. He yelled when I was about to add the black beans! When he found out it had been in the first batch, he told me to put them in. He didn't want to mess with perfection!

This was the perfect family meal for hanging out together & watching college football!!  Made it as written, except used 97/3 ground turkey.  However, there were 3 of us (ravenous), so I used 3 baking potatoes (distributed between 2 roasting pans) and then combined them back together into 1 pan before adding the meat topping and cheese.  We piled our pan high with lettuce & tomatoes, then I used a ziploc bag (with a whole cut in the corner) to pipe sour cream & guac evenly over the top...it was a work of art with phenomenal taste!!  Felt so much healthier than with chips....pure deliciousness!!!  This will be a regular 'tailgate' meal & beyond!

It sounded interesting having taco meat over crispy potatoes, but was truly not for us. The flavor combo just did not work... almost a yuck but not quite. Will make the meat and bean combo again as it would be lovely for tostadas if you added some onions and green chilies.

This is a nice variation to the usual nachos, and a great use of an overabundance of potatoes.  This was more filling than I expected.  I used red potatoes and sliced them about 1/4 inch thick.  It worked out perfectly for us.  We thought it was delicious.

This is a great variation on typical tacos/nachos. My husband (who is as picky as a child) LOVES it, and it has become a weekly staple for us. I was initially skeptical of potatoes and taco meat, but it really does go well together! I really haven't changed much from the original recipe outside of size based on how many I'm feeding, and I use ground turkey for everything, but the original recipe is great!

Made this for my mother in law on Cinco De Mayo when my husband was out of town for work. I was a bit skeptical but we both LOVED this! Super easy, cheap, great variety means you dont have to use alot of each ingredient!

I made a couple changes to the recipe, first we ate ours with salsa and  omitted the guacamole, and I added some taco seasoning to the potatoes before roasting them. I was a little worried my four year old wouldn't touch this since he's not a huge fan of potatoes but he loved them! He even had seconds!

Really liked this recipe...one of those you can modify to your liking. I used deer meat, threw in some garlic with the taco seasoning and added Mexican corn. Hubby doesn't like black beans so I used jalapeño ranch style beans and topped it with lettuce and salsa! Delicious!

My pickiest son rated this, "restaurant level".  Easy too.  I had only garbanzo beans but black beans would hàve been better.  I doubled it and had not leftovers for my family of five.  I served with ranch instead of sour cream.

My husband found this recipe and made it exactly according to the recipe (except for adding sliced jalapenos)and we all loved it.  Good ratio of beef/beans mix to the potatoes.  Our girls demand it every week now.

This was a nice change from plain old nachos. My family liked it. I pretty much doubled the recipe using the entire package of taco seasoning and a pound of beef. I didn't take time to make guacamole-I hate store bought-but salsa was great with it. I would make this again. If you have potato lovers in your house, they will definitely like it.

Delicious. Very versatile. Use parchment paper to avoid the potatoes sticking. Buy organic potatoes, wash, and do NOT peel for additional nutrition or substitute sweet potatoes. No guacamole so simply used avocado slices. I liked a little more meat in the dish, increase to 3/4 lb. Needs much more than 1/4 cup lettuce and definitely use salsa as topping.

These were pretty good, very filling. I think were a lot of effort for some that tastes good but also tastes so simple. I'll make them again when i feel like making the time for them.

This was great! I added a little smoked chipotle seasoning and garlic powder to the potatoes and turned them half way through. The beauty of it is, you can add the toppings you like. I added black olives and onions. LOVED IT!

Really good! I used homemade taco seasoning which takes only 2 minutes to make and has no msg or chemicals. This recipe also works well with yams subbed in for the potatoes.

Skinnied this up by using smaller potatoes, sliced thinner.. Used cooking spray on baking sheet, layered poyatoes, sprayed tops of potatoes, added salt and pepper. Baked as per instructions. Used LF ground turkey, used Birds Eye corn and black bean mix in place of black beans. Used FF yogurt in place of sour cream and omitted guacamole. Considering 4 servings (instead of 8 per recepie), calculated 7 points plus per serving.

Oh my! I have to say, the potatoes weren't as crispy as I'd expected, even though I gave them 5 extra minutes and used broil the last few minutes. No matter; they are SO good.  Saving this recipe to use again!

I LOVED this! I will definitely be making this again. The potatoes just give it a different taste and texture. The only things I changed were using yukon gold potatoes with olive oil, and I did not use oil to brown the meat. I've actually never heard of using oil to brown meat. Seems rather redundant AND costly in terms of calories and fat. Thank you for sharing this!!

I made this for dinner last night and the verdict is in.........my family LOVED it!  It was easy to make and it even looked like the picture when it was done.  The kids liked it too (ranging in age from 6 to 12)!  And in my kitchen, at the end of a "New" meal, if I get the "this is a make-again meal," you know it's a winner....and thats what I got!

I loved it! I used some leftover spaghetti sauce over the meat and beans and then broiled the cheese on top a bit then put the salad stuff on. It was delicious! Thank you for sharing this recipe : )

This was awesome!  I used leftover taco meat and shredded up some chicken breasts .  Instead of just black beans, I threw in some leftover southwestern corn too.  I think next time I may make it into a casserole.

3.5-4 stars ....This is a really good recipe however I did find it to be work intensive even with a mandolin slicer.  I followed the recipe as written for my Sunday football crowd (8 adults 4 children) and I thought the potatoes would have had a little more crispness to them (disappointment). I had to cook the potatoes in two batches of 2 full cookie sheets per batch, then the potatoes where hard to get off the pan....this took a lot of time to get them off whole.  I think this could be five stars if I could fix these problems and if anyone has already done so please let me know.

Made this several times already and it always comes out great!  It has become a favorite of ours.
