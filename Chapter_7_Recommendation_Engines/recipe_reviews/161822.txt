So refreshing! I loved the orange and avocado together. My orange was very juicy so it made for a "messy" sandwich but that's okay because it was so tasty. I think next time though I will made a salad with the orange, avocado, sprouts and balsamic on top of mixed greens.

This was great. I always mark the coming of spring by when the fruit and veggie stand in my neighborhood opens again. Went there this morning and got the makings of this sandwich, among other things. This is a wonderful dish that tastes like fresh summer. Thanks for the recipe! p.s. I did use some black pepper.

As a vegetarian I thought this sounded like a great idea for a sandwich but I found I liked the idea better than the execution.  I really enjoy the taste of avocado but when I made this sandwich the avocado flavor was completely overpowered by the orange.  I think I'll stick to tossing orange segments and avocado pieces in spinach salad with some balsamic vinaigrette instead.

This was a surprisingly delicious combination! I used kale instead of alfalfa sprouts for extra healthiness, and it tasted great.

Flavor explosion you bet! Delicious is an understatement, we loved it!! I made them into open face sandwiches to reduce the carbs & increase the veggies. I would not have thought of putting orange & avocado in a sandwich.......thanks a lot for the recipe.

Absolutely adore this sandwich.  I did add red onions and also tried a version of it with humus on the bread.  Every way delicious!

Very tasty, but it falls apart really easily!  Securing it with toothpicks does help, though.

It's pretty good. I prefer putting light mayo on two pieces of bread then toasting them face down on a skillet until browned. I then put sliced avocado, thinly sliced purple onion, lightly salt, and put a slice of cheese of your choice. I like swiss cheese. The important part is cooking he mayonaise into the bread. Yumm!

This was very easy and tasted very good.  I was not sure how I would like oranges with avocado, but I was pleasantly surprised.  It wasn't my favorite sandwich, but it was tasty and a change from my normal lunches.
