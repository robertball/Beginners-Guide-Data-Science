We added a little onion to the pan to sautee with the bacon, used fresh green beans, and added some seasoning salt, and these were delicious!  We'll definitely make this again!

Made this one tonight to go with ham...made exactly as written except that I used a bag of frozen whole string beans. First of all, I feel that there was way too much butter in this...the bacon drippings already add enough fat/moisture. Mostly though, my issue was the almonds. I added them at the time that was directed...and they burned (and I only had the burner on the '2' setting)...so I suggest adding the almonds in at the very end (maybe toasting them in the toaster oven first). So pretty much just reduce the butter significantly & add the almonds at the very end!

These were good except for just a couple issues.  One.. the almonds burned.  Two.. the only time it states a temperature is in the first step while cooking bacon. To remedy I would suggest the following:  Cook the bacon and remove from skillet. Add the butter and the almonds. When almonds are golden brown, remove them and add the beans to the bacon drippings/butter mixture. Reduce to medium heat to cook the beans and stir them often.  Crumble the bacon when it's cool enough to do so.  Add bacon and almonds back into the skillet for the last two or three minutes of cooking (to reheat them).  I will definitely make this again with the above modification.  Very tasty and easy to make and everyone liked them.

Who knew green beans would have so much flavor!  These were delicious.  I did drain most of the bacon grease off, though.  Adding butter is plenty.  Also added my almonds nearer to the end.  This is by no means meant for a fat-free diet.  But, will make these again for sure!!

This has now replaced the same old green bean casserole at our thanksgiving. I use fresh green beans and par boil them first, and I use sliced almonds instead of slivered. They stick to the beans better instead of falling to the bottom of the plate. These are the best green beans EVER!

I do not know what all these other people are talking about - this recipe was AWESOME. I made it exactly the way the recipe called for. I had two helping and couldn't stop eating it. I might add onions next time, but this dish was wonderful!  Thank you!

Loved this!  I used peppered bacon.  Yum.  Next time I won't use so much of the bacon grease though.  I like my veggies to have a more fresher taste.  They were coated a little to much (with the grease) for my taste.  Should have strained the grease off before putting in their serving tray.  Will make again though!

I made this once for a family dinner and now I am the official green bean maker for holiday dinners.  Everyone loved this recipe.  I do substitute regular bacon with turkey bacon and I do add fresh garlic as well.

Especially easy given I started with green beans I had brought home from a restaurant the night before because they couldn’t cook them beyond crunchy (I HATE that).  I just diced up the bacon and cooked it before adding the almonds briefly - no reason to cook it, then remove it.  I tossed in a little garlic, then the (only partially cooked) beans and cooked them until they no longer snapped and crunched when I bit into them.  While this isn’t a particularly inspired or creative recipe, it’s still a good one that makes green beans (especially those in a doggie bag) a little more special.

These were absolutely delicious!  The only thing I did different was to chop the bacon and bake for 12 minutes in a 375 degree oven.  Transferred the bacon to a large frying pan and sauteed a 1/2 cup chopped onions in the melted butter.  Threw the beans and remaining ingredients in, stirred frequently and served hot.  Yumm.  Thanks for sharing Lizzie.

YUM! I followed what another review suggested and cooked the bacon, removed - then drained most of the grease, put in a pat of butter and browned the almond slivers, removed those, then cooked the green beans (mine were fresh so i had to cook them longer) and then mixed in the bacon bits and almonds for a couple mins in the end before serving. will def. make again!!

This is totally "lick-the-pan" good, but not without a little adjustment. First of all, depending on your preference, I'd definitely either drain the bacon grease or omit the butter (I choose to omit the butter). I am guessing it's in there for sauteing the beans, but I found that I can still get a really tastey dish by precooking the beans and then tossing them together with the bacon and almond mixture just to coat everything nicely. I've been doing this with green and wax beans from the garden and the colors and flavors in this dish are amazing. I can also see playing with the basic idea and perhaps trying some garlic or onion in the saute or stirring in some other diced garden veggies (yellow or zucchini squash, tomato perhaps) along with the green beans.

I did a vegetarian version of this. I dropped the bacon and used fresh green beans rather than canned. I parboiled the beans--as suggested by another reviewer--for about 4 minutes. I sauteed a chopped onion until it was translucent and then added the green beans. I sprinkled salt, pepper and a dash of crushed red peppers onto the onions and sauteed everything for about 5 minutes--until the beans were tender but not overcooked. This came out quite well and I will certainly use this recipe again.

This was awesome:) I did make some changes, no biggies just (1) I left out the almonds because I didn't have any (2) I used turkey bacon because that's what we had (3) I used fresh green beans from my dad's garden and (4) I added a chopped onion and some minced garlic. Very yummy! Even the pickiest eater in my house ate every bit:)

I thought this turned out to be a great dish.  I followed other suggestions by adding onions when cooking the bacon.  I also drained some of the bacon grease and did not add the butter as I felt the grease was enough.

I did not follow the recipe exactly, but I did follow the basics. I cooked the bacon, and removed it, leaving the drippings. I then sauted onions in the bacon drippings. I added the slivered onions at this time. Once the onions were cooked and the almonds lightly browned I added the beans and about 2 tablespoons of water. I covered and let the beans steam a little in the water and drippings. I removed the cover and cooked on low heat until the water was absorbed/steamed off. Then I added the bacon, cooked on low for a couple more minutes. I transferred to a serving bowl and garnished with a pat of butter. These were tasty, and the beans weren't mushy. Great use of frozen beans. They were flavorful, and my husband who shy's away from eating anything green, loved them. I'm hoping that by cutting down on the butter and adding water, these were slightly less fattening.

I make these bean with every Christmas and Thanksgiving and they are always a hit. I made this recipe as written many time but prefer to reduce the calories a bit. I pour out most of the bacon fat, and add 1/2 of the butter. I always add 1/2 an onion, very thinnly sliced. Very good! Thanks for sharing.

Thanksgiving was the first time I fixed this recipe, and it is definately a keeper.  I used fresh green beans and boiled them for about 15 minutes, then drained them and added to the bacon.  I used half the butter and they came out fantastic!!!

We loved this dish. At nine minutes though the green beans were still too crisp for our tastes although my Mom would have loved them as they were tender crisp so I will cook them a couple minutes longer the next time. I used precooked bacon and simply snipped it up and then started the cooking process. This is a great side dish adn we really enjoyed it. Thanks!

Pretty darn good... hard to go wrong with bacon! I used fresh green beans, and I wish I'd blanched them first. They didn't soak up much flavor. However, I saved it by tossing in diced eggplant - THAT really soaked up the flavor! I put the almonds (I used whole instead of slivered) in with the bacon when it was almost done, and pulled them out at the same time as the bacon - they were a little burnt-tasting, so next time I might cook them separately after the bacon's done.

I used sliced almonds midway thru so they wouldn't burn and stick better. I did have to add salt & garlic powder. Did not have to use all the grease. Next time I think I will try adding onions. Very tasty.

So so good.  Even my picky kid ate them.  Not sure I could ever go back to plain green beans.

Excellent recipe. I've tried it with bacon and with panchetta, and I have to say that it's significantly better with panchetta. But it's an absolute keeper, and perfect for company dinners!

This was so good! My kids loved it! I used fresh green beans and I always cheat using the packaged bacon crumbs from the salad isle.  I have a 3,4, and 7 year old and all of them asked for 2nds!

These were really fantastic.  Used fresh green beans, partially cooking in the microwave.  I omitted the almonds, but only because I didn't have any on hand but I did add some thinly sliced onions.  Will be making these again.  Thanks for this quick an easy recipe!

For my version of the Sauteed Green Beans I used an entire package of Turkey bacon, a large Vidalia onion, and 4 cloves of garlic all sauteed in one pan.  I then added 2 thoroughly strained frozen  green bean packages and 1/2 cup of toasted halved almonds.  This was a hit during dinner!!  It was light and extremely flavorful.

I used fresh green beans and cooked them a little longer and they came out fine! I didn't use the 1/4 c butter, but did put a pat of butter at the end of cooking (I thought the bacon drippings were enough to cook them in). Husband thought they were VERY good! (me too)

An excellent recipe to work off of. I made without the bacon cause I didn't have it and substituted chopped pecans for the almonds. I boiled the beans for about 8 minutes to soften them up, then proceeded with the recipem sauteeing everything in butter. My boyfriend now requests this style beans and askd for extra nuts! I know the bacon will be more savory and will try it when I have it in stock. Thank you for a great recipe.

Nothing special, but still very good basic GB recipe. I only buy the pre-cooked bacon, so I just cut the slices with my kitchen shears, and put everything (except the almonds) in the skillet at the same time. I added the almonds at the end, and cooked them long enough to slightly brown. They were a hit.

I tried this recipe and found it to be without any flavor at all.  I think it would do better with canned green beans as the flavor from the bacon would go thru the beans better.

A big hit! I did, however, modify it as others have. I  was careful to add the almonds at the end so they wouldn't burn, but should have done the same with the bacon. The bacon was perfectly done when I chopped it up, but after cooking with the beans they burned. Next time I'll wait until the end for both the bacon and almonds. Also, I only used half the butter and bacon drippings - thought that using the amount in the recipe for butter and drippings was overkill.

This is too much fat for me. I cook the bacon in the microwave between paper towels that absorb the grease. Crumble the bacon. Sauté beans and onions in 2tsp. Olive oil, adding almonds the last 2 minutes. Season with  salt and pepper.

This was good. I changed it a bit though. I love garlic, so I sliced a whole head of garlic, and fried it to golden brown with the bacon before adding the other ingredients. This does not make it too garlicky, but just utterly delicious.

I took a lot of liberties with this recipe (based on what I had available) and it still turned out fantastic.  I used fresh green beans instead of frozen, and cooked them in the microwave first.  I used packaged bacon bits, and added red onion and garlic.  I sauteed the onion and garlic in the butter until they were soft and transparent, and then added the bacon bits, almonds, and beans all at the same time, cooking for another 5-10 minutes.  Fantastic!  A definite addition to my recipe box.

Used frozen french cut greenbeans, toasted the almonds separately in the toaster oven and added at the end with the crumbled bacon once the green beans were heated through in the bacon grease and butter.  AWESOME!

We use the recipe for a lot of veggies including broccoli and even brussel sprouts. We added 1/4 cup chopped onion sauteed with the bacon. It adds that extra umph that was missing the first time we tried the recipe.

I used fresh green beans and boiled them first with bacon chunks in it.  Once they were al dente I strained them and then put them in the skillet with melted butter and added the almonds.  Sauteed until the almonds were browned.  Even my texture sensitive child ate these!!!  Boiling the bacon with the beans alleviated the greasy beans and the butter was not heavy at all without the bacon grease.  I would have probably liked the bacon to be a little more done/crisper in appearance/texture but I would rather have the bacon kind of blah (all the flavor was still there) than have to deal with the grease.

Need to break up bacon at least in half before cooking.  Used fresh green beans and cooked those separately before putting in the pan with the bacon

I know ppl hate when you change the orignal recipe but this is how I share without having to get my recipe posted. So, here it is: follow directions listed, but drain 3/4 of bacon grease and in the final minute or two add 2-3 tbl spoons of honey.

This turned out great!  I made it with Potatoes Au Grautin and Spicy Grilled Chicken.  All I needed was a homeade dinner roll and the meal would have been complete.

This was okay - the dish looks beautiful but didn't have a ton of flavor. I reheated it the next day and it actually tasted better the next day! I might try to make it again and use more bacon to get more flavor.

I was multi-tasking when doing this so I burnt the almonds and had to pick most of them out.  Fine by me since I wasn't necessarily wanting them, anyway.  Otherwise, very tasty and easy to do!

These are wonderful.  I also added garlic as suggested.  I used the cooked bacon that you buy and it only gives you a minimal amount of bacon grease and then added the butter.  Every family member enjoyed them and I have some picky eaters.

Skip the butter, with the bacon fat it was way too much grease.  In fact, when the left over was stored in the fridge you could see the hardened grease.

Loved this recipe.  May want to take off some of the bacon drippings and put them aside so that the beans don't get too greasy.  You can always add some back if needed.  Great flavor.

You really need to add some other seasonings here. I used fresh minced garlic as well as seasoning salt and fresh ground black pepper. Also, upped the amount of almonds. This is the only way my kids will eat green beans.

These were good for fresh beans.  I didn't want to overcook, but I should have steamed them a little longer as they were a little tough.  Will try again when I can get better, smaller beans.  Maybe add a little fresh minced garlic?

Wow! This was really good!  I used turkey bacon, and will probably use regular bacon next time, as the turkey bacon cooks a little too quickly.  I added about a 1/4 cup of chopped onion and threw in some canned mushrooms that I had left over from my main dish....the whole family really enjoyed it.

I had some frozen green beans that I wanted to use in a different way; this is a great option.  I made the recipe using the ingredients but in a slightly different way:  I microwaved the 5 slices of bacon on a plate for 5 minutes until golden brown (it takes way too long to cook in a fry pan and the microwave  makes it so fast).  I cooked the almonds in the butter until golden brown.  I slightly defrosted the beans in the microwave and then tossed into the pan with the almonds.  Once the bacon had cooled I broke up the bacon and sprinkled it on the beans along with some of the bacon grease.  Tasted great and it took less than 10 minutes from start to finish.  I will make again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

delicious used frozen green beans and bacon bits instead of bacon mostly because that is what I had on hand. I added a little bit of braggs amino acids. I will definitely be making this again. Next time I think I will try it with onions

This came out pretty good. What I would suggest is adding the almonds after the beans, as mine burned by the time the beans were cooked. It's a matter of timing the ingredients right. Otherwise, it was very tasty.

I made these for Thanksgiving dinner in 2011. My friend's mother LOVED them and had 3 helpings. So I made them again for Thanksgiving 2012. Everybody loves the dish! I used fresh green beans, not frozen.

These are just fabulous! I cook bacon in the microwave, so browned the almonds in the melted butter. Everyone loves them, even the husband who hates frozen green beans!

I made this the other day for the Sunday dinner and used fresh and also a package of steamed green beans with a few extra almonds - it was wonderful.  My family devoured the entire bowl.  This will be a staple in our family's meal plans!

The recipe was very easy to make and I would probably do only two tbsp of butter (not the suggested 4 which equals 1/4 of a cup).  Big hit!

We liked these very much.  Didn't do the almonds as 1 family member has nut issues. I agree with other reviewers that some of the bacon grease should be drained off and maybe a little less butter.  I added just of pinch of kosher salt and fresh ground pepper.  I'm thinking next time to sprinkle with grated parmesan cheese at the end.  Makes a very lovely presentation.

My husband was very happy with this recipe.  He ate all his beans and left some steak on his plate.  That was a first.  All I had was canned green beans.  I used two cans.  I used a spoon of butter instead of 1/4 cup.  Used Mrs Dash and a shake of dried onions while sauteing the the bacon. I didn't have any almonds so I sprinkled a few salted pistachios on top before serving. Next time I will use fresh green beans.  I am looking forward to making this dish again.

These were really good.  I'd say they need some salt.  Easy to make.  I added the almonds when I added the green beans to avoid burning them.

It's wonderful when a recipe as simple as this one can elicit such rave reviews. My husband said, "Those were the best green beans I've ever had, hands down. Whenever you make green beans, THAT is the way I'd love for you to make them!" Since he's a rather picky eater, I was thrilled. I love green beans and was looking for something different to add to our chicken entree. I happened to have slivered almonds already and had real bacon pieces, so I just used those. It turned out great! I took leftovers to work the next day and they were yummy! Thanks, Lizzie!

I love the simpleness of this as a side. After cooking the bacon, and green beans, added pepper, lemon zest( to replace the almonds, not a big nut eater) and 1 tsp of pesto and WOW.............so good. I use it cold or warm, it depends on the weather.  The lemon adds a nice light fresh taste and the pepper adds  a spicy kick! Soooo good thank you for the idea!

I tweaked it a bit - I drained the bacon fat before I added butter, and waited until the very end to add the crumbled bacon back to the dish to keep it crispy.  I also added crushed garlic, maple syrup and salt to taste.  I must say it was very yummy with my additions. :)

By far this is one of my family's favorite way to eat green beans. It has been a family Thanksgiving side for three years running and will be for many more to come. I have tried it with 2# of beans, one full package of almonds and a full pound of bacon as well. Also good, but use unsalted butter with the extra bacon.

This was good. I used boring old canned green beans and it changed them. Being from Louisiana, I also sauted fresh garlic and added Creole Seasoning to the beans while they were cooking. Next time, I would like to add shrimp.

These were tasty but really nothing special. An extremely unhealthy way to prepare veggies. I may try them again but i'll reduce the butter and add some salt and pepper.

I tried to get the bacon/almond topping right twice and seemed to burn the bacon/almonds both times. The green beans were salvageable and crisp but the bacon/almonds failed me.

Tried this yesterday for Thanksgiving. Gotta say, in my opinion, the taste doesn't make the fat and calories worthwhile. Somehow, the bacon flavor did not come through. It did look pretty on the plate though.

Pretty delicious. I didn't use butter (wasn't necessary). I added feta cheese and sundried tomatoes. Before adding the green beans, I sauteed 1 minced clove of garlic in the pan for 30 seconds.

I loved this dish as so did everybody else! I followed some of the other reviews' suggestion to drain most of the drippings and so I left only a little bit, probably about 2 Tsp, to brown the almonds and give flavor to the green beans. I also used a little less butter (2 Tsp, which was a little bit less than 1/4 cup) and the beans were still delicious and flavorful. I first cooked the bacon, then drain the drippings and bacon, brown the almonds. About 10 minutes in low heat. Then added back the bacon, the butter and then the beans. Great recipe!!!

Very good recipe for green beans, especially if you want to add a little variety in a simple way. I used a 28 oz bag of frozen green beans, no almonds and same amount of butter and bacon. It turned out great and the dish was almost gone!

okay, so I wasn't able to follow the recipe to a tee (seeing as how I didn't have any slivered almonds on hand), but it still turned out oh so good! That, and I added a lil red crushed pepper towards the very end of cooking, which added just enough spice to the green beans! My boyfriend raved over these beans! Definetly going to make again! YUMMY!! thanks for sharing!!!

I added the almonds to the bacon skillet when the recipe called for them but they ended up burned.  I would not recommend this to anyone who doesn't like burnt almonds.

I used Tania's suggestion and made this recipe with sundried tomatoes and feta.  It was really great and my hubby really enjoyed.  I made it healthier by omitting the bacon and butter.  I simply sprayed the pan with a bit of olive oil, sauteed garlic and almonds, added green beans and then tossed in the sundried tomatoes when almost done.  I cooled and then added some really fresh, good quality feta.

To make it healthier I left out most of the bacon grease and butter which I'm sure compromised the flavor, but they were still very good.

This was good, but I highly recommend dumping the bacon grease and not using it to cook the beans in, like the others suggested also.  The butter alone is plenty.

Great flavor with the bacon, onion and almonds. I agree to cut out most of the bacon grease.  It's not necessary.  I used french cut green beans.

Yum.  A little on the geasy side, but Himself loved them and asks for them again.  Drain some of the bacon grease off before you add the butter.

I tried the recipe exactly as written using frozen green beans and it was a big hit with the family at Thanksgiving.  I do think that the peppered bacon would be a nice addition, if you want more spice.  Nice, easy side dish.

It's a tasty recipe but it's important to note that the almonds burned easily during the time it took for the green beans to soften. I would also reduce the amount of bacon.

This was a great way to make green beans!!  I used fresh and they came out very crisp and flavorful.  Plan to try this method with lima beans next!
