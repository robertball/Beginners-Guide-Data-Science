Made this tonight and got rave reviews from my boyfriend...The only things I did differently was add some more butter to the sauce, as well as some freshly grated parmesan cheese. It was such a beautiful presentation along side roasted asparagus, and even better taste. Thank you!

this was one of the more inexpensive recipes I've tried.  This covered us for dinner and my boyfriend's lunch the next day.  Sauce was enough for 4 medium pork chops.  I didn't have italian seasoning  (these are mostly salt anyways as Alton Brown says) but followed everything else exact.

Made this for dinner, and it was a definite hit. As one kid said, 'this goes in the rotation'... which is pretty good praise from my crowd.
Not sure if the sauce got away from me, but it turned out a tad grainy. Not inedible at all, but there at the last, I got a little busy and think it separated a tad. I resized the recipe to serve 6, and it told me to use 3 cups of half and half, which would have been ridiculous, so I only used 2 and reduced it by about 1/3. 
Served over buttered noodles with some boneless loin chops I carved from a whole loin and a side of sauteed cabbage with leeks.
All around great experience. I would pay for this in a restaurant, and that's about as good as it gets in my world.

I omitted the shallot since I didn't have any and added a little parmesan cheese and garlic to the sauce.  Turned out great!

I didn’t have horseradish mustard so I made my own using prepared horseradish, Dijon mustard, and plain nonfat Greek yogurt (instead of sour cream which the recipe called for).  I served the pork and sauce over riced cauliflower and some leftover brown rice.  I had plenty of my horseradish mustard leftover after adding some to the skillet  mixture so I put a dollop on the side and added it in as I ate. I really liked the flavor.

I'll probably make this again, which is pretty good praise. I made it as directed except neither my husband nor I like horseradish, so I substituted the horseradish mustard for a spicy brown mustard. And we cooked 4 thin pork chops instead of 2 normal ones. There was plenty of sauce for all 4. There might have been too much onion for me, that's my only critique. But it tasted delicious.

Delicious and very easy to make.  I used dried thyme and increased the white wine a little for taste.

This is good once.  We had left overs so I ate this for two days and the flavor went from new and exciting to near appalling.  I think this is a dish you serve once and not often.

Loved this! I added half of the amount of 1/2 and 1/2, and used milk in place to save some calories. But other than that, we did the same. It was delicious.

My husband and I were not that pleased with this dish. The pork was very dry and the cream in the sauce curdled. We won't be making it again.

My husband and I both loved it. I changed a few things based on what I had in the house. The sauce was thinner than I expected but it was excellent especially over the rice. I served it with sautéed spinach and onions. We will have it again.

The sauce is very good. The chops turned out extremely dry and tasteless.  I would not make this again.
