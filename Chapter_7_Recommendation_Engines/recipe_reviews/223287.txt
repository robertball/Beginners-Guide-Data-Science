I think this was a good idea in theory. It didn't really work out for us. There was a little too much liquid. I'd try this again but omit the applesauce maybe.

Made this recipe for the 1st time and i added a tiny little bit of sugar to it and instead of blackberry i used fresh strawberry and it was really good considering i never add eggs to my oatmeal. It really was a new and nice experience. Will definitely make it again. And since i'm settling my son for college abroad it gave me ideas how to make it easier for him once i leave .

This was a different way to have oatmeal, and I liked it. The other reviewer mentioned that there was too much liquid, so I overflowed my 1/2 cup of oatmeal a bit. Mine turned out thick and creamy. If you like your oatmeal on the thin side, I would recommend sticking to the measurements in the recipe. I've had egg whites in oatmeal before, but never a whole egg. It wasn't as fluffy as with just the whites, but it was good. I liked the applesauce and the little tang from the yogurt. I don't especially like blackberry yogurt, so I used strawberry. The only other thing I did differently was to add some chopped pecans (after I took the pic), because I felt the need for some crunch today. One serving was very filling. Thanks for a great way to make oatmeal.
