Not good.  Quick and easy, but VERY bland.  We were pouring parmesan and garlic powder over it just to make it taste like SOMETHING.  I noticed after the fact that the recipe was submitted by Hidden Valley Ranch, which I obediently poured a cup of into my noodles.  Sounded good, simply wasn't; and now I need to buy more mustard.  Stay away.

I did not care for this at all.  It smelled great but had no taste.

This did not taste good at all...I'm not quite sure why.  No one in my household cared for this...
