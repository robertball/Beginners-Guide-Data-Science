The batter/dough was very thick, and I was concerned about how this would turn out.  Not to worry because it turned out great!  The marshmallows folded into the batter totally  melted helping to keep the cake moist but didn't interfere with the blondie "texture," and the strawberries give just enough sweetness.  I made a few substitutions using Egg Beaters® and Splenda Brown Sugar Blend® but kept the measurements in the correct proportion.  I did think 1 Tbsp of vanilla would be overpowering, so I cut that in half.    Experimenter, this is a very nice blondie recipe, and thanks for sharing, we enjoyed it!

I made it exactly as is, the blondies were flat and I found them too sweet. But the kids love it, so I might make again. I think I'll double everything, though.

My husband thought these could use some chocolate chips, though I think they were fine without.  I wasn't a fan of the texture of the marshmallows on top, but that wasn't too bad. The blondies were very moist and had a good flavor, so I'll probably make them again. The strawberries gave them a little something special that makes them stand out from a lot of recipes. They're not as dense as a typical brownie/blondie, but they're denser than cake. They could be eaten by hand, but it's easier to eat them with a fork.

It definitely makes a nice size amount though I wouldn't really call these "blondies." It's more cake-like in texture. It's kinda light and poofy. When you slice it, it doesn't really stay together and kinda falls apart. It tastes nice but it's kinda messy and not in the ooey gooey way. More like it just kinda spongy and plop. I definitely do not understand where the photo came from because they do not look like that in real life!  And I have baking experience so it isn't like I don't know how to follow a recipe and so it looks like blurg. So I think it was ok. I'd not make it again. It's also very sweet! But I can forgive that in most things. I posted photos so there's a better idea of what it looks like. It also took way longer than the recipe said to cook and ended up still underdone in the center while being overdone on top. And I know it wasn't the oven either. Sad.
