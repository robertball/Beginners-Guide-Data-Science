This was really yummy, and has already been requested twice! However, I modified the recipe to my family's tastes. As suggested by previous reviewers, I used homemade applesauce in place of the oil called for. Also added molasses, and used between 4-8 Tbs. water instead of eggs.(Didn't measure the amount of liquid. Just eyeballed it. I needed the extra liquid b/c I also added one large chopped apple, and 1/2 c chopped almonds.)  Substituted almond milk for the milk, and used Rumford's non-aluminum baking powder. I omitted the raisins and used a handful of dry cranberries instead. Omitted the brown sugar topping, and added more cinnamon, as well.

I love this recipe. I need to eat more oatmeal and this recipe makes it so yummy! I change it slightly, using applesauce instead of oil and I use 1/4 cup of white sugar, then 1/2 of brown. And I add a can of fruit (peaches are great!) and some chopped walnuts. It fills me up for hours! Great with just the spray butter or if you want to pour milk on it, why not?

This recipe is a definite winner - our whole family loves it!  It's a great breakfast dish to make when you have overnight guests.  I often double the recipe and bake it in an 11x14 glass baking dish (using 1 c white and 1 c brown sugar).  You can easily mix this up the night before, cover with plastic, stick it in the fridge, and simply bake it in the morning whenever you wake up.  NOTE: To avoid breaking my cold glass baking dish by placing it in a hot oven, I put the cold dish into the oven BEFORE I turn the oven on (that way the dish and the oven slowly heat at the same time).  If I'm baking this oatmeal staight from the fridge, I'll increase the baking time a bit (about 45-50 minutes for a single recipe or 60-75 minutes for the 11x14 size double recipe), otherwise I use the time given in the recipe.  Mmm-Mmm!, great on a chilly morning!

This was nice and cakey and had a great flavor. I did sub applesauce for the oil. Next time I will try pumpkin puree and add some spices. I hate regular oatmeal and love eating this so it gets 5 stars from me.

I did not like oatmeal for breakfast - until now. It's got the texture of rice but tastes more like dessert.  I reduced the amount of sugar to half a cup and it is still plenty. I also make & bake it in the morning (haven't left it overnight in refrigerator) and it is still great.  My 3 year old will eat it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner!  I will make it at least once a week from now on.  If you're not a oatmeal eater - try this!

I ordered baked oatmeal for the first time this morning at a restaurant. It was so good that I immediately looked in All Recipes for a similar dish when I got home. This one looks close except the restaurant put blueberries and diced peaches in with the oatmeal. They served it with cream and brown sugar on the side. It was wonderful. I will try making this recipe and add the fruit.

Family liked this.  It is dry like a crumbly cake texture, but when you pour the milk on, it brings it all together.  And with some butter on top, Mmm, Mmm, Mmm.  I am also going to try this with apples and peaches.

I made this for breakfast this morning and it was great.  As a topping/side dish, I made Jenny's Sauteed Apples (type "Sauteed Apples" in the search), and it was perfect.  My mom wants me to make it again next week.

This is really a unique way to serve oatmeal.I added cinnamon and 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar in with the egg and milk mixture.Also used Old Fashioned oats for coarser texture. Baked it in a lightly oiled 8X8 square pan. It sets up enough that it maintains the cut shape. I cut in squares and served with milk and a tad of sugar over it. We will enjoy this occasionally for breakfast. I still prefer my oatmeal the regular way, though. Thanks Tracy.

Great recipe!  My 2 year old won't touch it, but she doesn't like oatmeal anyway.  But I like it!  It is a lot more grainy, and less mushy than most oatmeal recipes, which appeals to me.  I substituted applesauce for the oil. I have made it with raisins and without, both great.  I usually serve it with apples or pears.

I have made this recipe many times..it really is nice for someone who is dieting, like I am. I cut the recipe in half and make it in a 6 inch round casserole dish and it makes four nice servings, which refrigerate very well for another morning. To heat it up later, I put my serving in a bowl, microwave it for 30 sec., then pour the milk over it and return it to the microwave for another 25 sec...and it tastes just like it came out of the oven...especially with the warm milk. I did substitute applesauce for the oil and cut down the sugar to taste in the oatmeal itself (2Tbsp brown sugar)and then added a 1/4 of an apple, peeled and diced. I figured out the points for Weight Watchers, in case you are interested..with low fat milk it comes to 4 1/2 points per serving and makes a very healthy filling breakfast.

SO GOOD!!! 
I used applesauce instead of oil and no white sugar. I did mix in about 1 tablespoon of brown sugar and a little cinnamon instead of on top. Honestly, I don't think you need any of the sugar - especially if you top it with some frozen but thawed berries (with all that yummy juice) and a little milk. Deeeelish!

I love this recipe!  The only change I made was to use 1/4 cup Sunsweet Lighter Bake oil/butter substitute in place of the 1/2 cup oil.  I like the fact that it can be mixed the night before and baked the next morning.  This is like a heavy, moist coffee cake, and I ate the entire pan myself in two days.

Very simple to throw together!! Gathering from the reviews my siblings gave me it was very yummy as well. This was the first time they had ever tried baked oatmeal and they definitely enjoyed it. I doubled the recipe and made it in a 9x13 pan. I also omitted the raisins, subbed applesauce for the oil, and used half of the brown sugar called for. The only complaint I received was that it was a little too sweet. Next time I will reduce both the white and brown sugar. Thanks for sharing:) *update* As good as this recipe is,  Baked Oatmeal II from this site is even better.

I tried this recipe because I was looking for a way to make a good energy packed breakfast for my working son.  This fit the bill perfectly.  I used applesauce and Splenda in place of oil and sugar, and cut the recipe in half (just in case we didn't like it).  We had 4 nice size pieces and it's great hot from the oven or cold as a pick me up around 4.  I'll make the full recipe next time and maybe try adding the grated apple, some nuts, or other suggested ingredients.

This can be altered to suit your tastes and health need.  I used coconut oil in stead of vegetable oil, 1/2 cup of brown sugar (next time will take it down to 1/3 cup) added some vanilla extract, and used coconut milk instead of regular milk.  Next time I will try apples instead of raisins.  Could also do pumpkin puree and pumpkin pie spices.  This will be a regular breakfast in our house

Made this for the first time this morning.  OMG it was so good!  I did as what most reviewers did - substituted the oil with applesauce and I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and added a teaspoon of vanilla.  I am definitely going to make this again!  I am so tempted to make another one for work tomorrow!

Off the chain! I substituted the oil for applesauce, added a few more raisins and cooked it for 20-25 minutes (because other reviews said theirs came out dry). I also didn't refrigerate overnight, I couldn't wait to try it. It turned it great anyway. I already love oatmeal, so I figured I would like it, but I'm waiting to see what non-oatmeal lovers say about it to see if it's a true hit lol Will definitely make again!

Great suggestion to substitute applesauce for the oil!  I used a lasagna pan instead of pie plate, baked 30 minutes at 350, and ended up with 9 huge delicious squares of "oatmeal cake".  I didn't find it dry at all - somewhere between bread pudding and a very moist muffin.  Very filling, and an easy way to get a healthy breakfast.

Amazing recipe. I halved it and put it in an 8" square pan. Used almond oil and halved the sugar.
Sprinkled the top with cinnamon sugar and bits of butter. Tip: Grate frozen butter stick over pan. 
I only baked it for 20 minutes because I have a 
convection oven.  Something like a soft oatmeal
cookie with a little crunch.  It took all my willpower not to eat more!  Just as good the next 
day. Try it you will like it!!!

Made this as written...can you imagine that? If you like oatmeal, as my wife does it was a winner. Bottom line is it's basically a bowl of oatmeal, baked. The baking adds a warm earthy note that plain oatmeal doesn't have. A review of the ingredients will tell you there are not a lot of "flavor" ingredients (vanilla, cinnamon...maple syrup...etc), so no surprise that everyone is adding and adjusting to suit their taste. Which makes this a fun basic recipe.

I first had this when I visited a college several years ago. The students who hardly eat anything of value would literally "eat it up." However, now that I'm on a cardiac diet, I very much appreciated Whirldpeas information. I was looking for a recipe that I could adapt to something as wonderful as baked oatmeal. Thank you Whirldpeas. And just know for those who found his review objectionable, there are those of us who appreciated it. I know I'm one of them.

I thought this was good, but only after I added melted butter and milk to moisten each serving.  

If you think you don't like oatmeal unless it's baked, try making oatmeal in the microwave with milk (whole - or add some cream to your skim) instead of water, and then stir in a dash of salt and some brown sugar.  Top with fresh berries (whatever you have on hand), cinnamon, and a little cardamom.  This is much healthier, much faster, and in my opinion tastier.  I would still do the baked version for a crowd, because you can make many servings in one pan, but for every day try it in the microwave as described - healthier and better.

Great recipe!  Can be changed up easily depending on what flavor you want.  I split the sugar into 1/2 c brown sugar & 1/4 c white sugar, 1 T cinnamon & 2 c craisins.  I also served it with a touch of butter and milk drizzled on top.  My picky daughter complained until she tried it.  Our family ate up the whole dish in a flash!  This will definitely be one of our regular recipes!

I used applesauce in place of oil and sprinkled the top with pecans.  Delicious!

I added nutmeg and mixed in some walnuts and sliced pears to make this go farther.  It turned out great!  The pears were an excellent addition, and the nutmeg and walnuts added a lot of flavor.

This is amazing!  It's good enough to serve to company, and easy enough to make any day of the week.  It even reheats well for a great snack!  When I want to serve a sweeter dish I add enough brown sugar on top to make a thin layer, maybe 1/4 c, and it carmelizes in the oven to make a nice sugar crust.

Always a winner when I make a batch and take it to the family in Augusta, GA.  I make for me and the hubby and portion it for the freezer.  Add milk and nuke it and it's super satisfying.  Try adding pecans and cran-raisins....love it!

This recipe was great just how it was written, but a little dry. I changed quite a few things and we then thought it was excellent and a bit healthier.  1. I used 1/2 cup of sugar (I plan to decrease this to 1/3 cup) 2. I used one granny smith apple instead of the raisins 3. I used 1 1/4 cup milk 4. I put it chopped pecans, walnuts, and sliced almonds 5. I used 2 1/2 cup of oats and 1/2 cup of wheat germ, flax, and wheat bran mixed together 6. I added 1 tsp of vanilla 7. I added 1 tsp of cinnamon to the base  8. I increased the cinnamon to 1 tsp for the topping 9. I omitted the salt 10. I plan to use 1/2 cup of applesauce when I have it - right now I don't

My family loves this recipe! I always use applesauce instead of oil. I also use half brown sugar and half white sugar. I have made this both with and without diced apples and/or raisins. This morning, I didn't have either, so I threw in two mashed bananas and a handful of coconut...and it came out great! (Although, I do think that the taste of two bananas was a bit too much, so I'd only use one next time.) This recipe is filling, delicious, and is good the next day, too (if it lasts that long).

Delicious!  My kids loved it.  I added the brown sugar in with the white sugar at the beginning.  Also added 1 small can (drained) peaches that I cut up in chunks (another subscriber suggested this).  Served with 1/2 and 1/2 and extra raisins on the side.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Very yummy Tracy.  I only had 2 cups worth of oatmeal, so I scaled the servings down to 6.  I went ahead and used a full cup of BROWN sugar because I like my oatmeal sweet.  I added a splash of vanilla extract and just sprinkled the cinnamon in while I was mixing.  This baked up perfectly and the left-overs tasted great too.  So glad I've found a new way to prepare oatmeal.  Thanks for sharing.

Soooooo good! My husband who claimed not to like oatmeal even loved it. I did make some changes based on other reviews. I read one review that said that reviewing a recipe you've changed is rude but I think thats what makes all recipes so great! And you can change it to suit your needs.
Changes I made: 1. I halfed the recipe. 2. I used a bottle of baby applesauce instead of oil (great way to use up those jars that my 13 month old son won't eat! He also loved this recipe btw) 3. I used almond milk instead of regular (I'm watching calories) 5. I used 1/3 cup sugar...two Tbsp of white and 3 of brown and then sprinkled about 2 tsp on top. 6. I added 1 tsp of vanilla. 7. I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon in the mix as well as sprinkling it on top. 
I cooked it in a square 8X8 inch pan.  I cut that into four servings. Each of the four servings has 205 calories and 2g of fat. Super healthy. When I pulled it out of the oven i poured just a little milk to cool it off, the milk absorbed and it was so delish. Was like eating cake for breakfast. I eat a lot of oatmeal so it's nice to have another version that still is low in calories.

I love oatmeal and wanted to try the baked version. I only changed a few things. I mixed the cinnamon and brown sugar in the oatmeal instead of sprinkling on top, I also only let it sit for about 2 hours before baking. I added peaches to mine. I read quite a few reviews that it was dry etc but mine was not! It was very moist! About 20 minutes into baking I took a fork and mixed it up as well. Next time I will cut the white sugar in 1/2 because it was sweet! I added milk to the finished product which cuts out all the sweetness as well. Great recipe!!!

This was sooo good!  I doubled the recipe and put it in a 9x13, but next time I'll try a 10x14.  I cut down on the sugar like other reviews said, and I added about a cup of chopped fresh strawberries.  It was plenty sweet.  I'm looking forward to making this more often, and trying lots of different add-ins like apples, peaches, nuts and more cinnamon, blueberries, and whatever else I can think of!  I didn't have applesauce, so I did use oil, but I'm definitely going to give the applesauce substitution a shot.  Also, this was a perfect consistency for my one-year-old baby to eat (he only has 7 teeth, 4 on top, 3 on bottom).

This is awesome. I wanted something comforting and hot for breakfast and this fit the bill. I used applesauce instead of oil, and only added 1/4 cup white sugar, the rest being brown sugar. I left out the raisins as I didn't have any and added chocolate chips instead. It comes out like a giant pie plate muffin but not dry. I baked it the night before and just microwaved it in the morning and it was awesome. I can't wait to try it with apples or cranberries, and I also want to try it with some vanilla frozen yougurt as a dessert. I will definitely be making this one again!!! Thanks for the great breakfast recipe.

This was wonderful! I have had baked oatmeal out and tried to recreate it unsuccessfully; this was exactly it. Texture is cross between muffin and fluffy oatmeal cookie. I made it with butter instead of oil and baked in muffin pan. Replaced raisins with dried cherries and splash of almond extract, and served hot in a bowl with half-half. YUM. Will be a regular at our house.

This is a fantastic recipe! The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because I had to cut both the sugar and oil in half (as other reviewers did), with applesauce in place of the oil. I also used a small chopped granny smith apple and added just a T. or so of raisins. (My children don't like raisins) The result was a wonderful apple/cinnamon oatmeal "pie". It was a healthy, easy, and a big hit. Let the mix sit for 5-10 minutes - no need to refrigerate. Thank you, Tracy! This is my new Sunday morning breakfast along with turkey bacon and/or veggie sausages.

Awesome breakfast alternative! I made it using the applesauce substitute for the oil that was recommended in many of the reviews. Used ½ cup brown sugar and ¼ cup white sugar – the sweetness is perfect with this combination. I had buttermilk in the refrigerator, so used that instead of milk, which worked out well. Per family request ½ cup crasins, ½ cup walnuts and 1 Tablespoon apple pie spice (recipe found here for the apple pie spice) were mixed in, and baked in a 9 x 9 baking pan. This is a definite keeper recipe that is loaded with other possible fruit, nut and spice combination possibilities.

My children really liked this, getting seconds, even the picky eaters.  I used coconut oil in place of vegetable.  cooking oats, rather than quick.  We are out of raisins and so I used a 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  We are out of milk, and so I used water instead.  I also did not let it sit over night.  I just put it in the oven as soon as I mixed it up.  It made a cross between breakfast and dessert :) but still healthier than a box of cereal, I'm sure.   We served it with a pat of butter on top.

Absolutely wonderful! I used Splenda in place of the sugar and applesauce in place of the oil.  Tasted great!  We are on our second batch of baked oatmeal and this time I added the crunch topping from the "To Die for Blueberry Muffins" on this site.  AMAZING!  It makes it a bit sweeter...more like a dessert or coffee cake but the topping is to die for.    To Make Crumb Topping: Mix together 1/2 cup sugar, 1/3 cup flour, 1/4 cup butter, and 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon. Mix with fork, and sprinkle over oatmeal before baking. It makes a lot of topping so you could make less to suit your taste!

This was very good, but I gave it four stars because I thought it could use some improvements: first I would add some brown sugar to the oatmeal mixture as well as on top, and maybe reduce the white sugar; and I baked mine for 35 minutes, but it only really needed 30, maybe less; I would also put cinnamon in the oatmeal mixture as well, and possibly try other spices.  Overall it was really good, and I will definitely make again.

Try with the milk and butter poured over when hot. Also, leftovers keep very well and reheat in the microwave excellently.

1. Great, with my changes: 1/2 c brown, 1/2 c white sugar, peach juice from a can instead of milk, butter the dish instead of oil. Tasted like an oatmeal cookie! Great with milk.
2. Butter the dish instead of oil. 1/2 c white sugar, 1/4 c molasses. It was better the first time.
3. I used mandarin orange juice from the can and it had a slightly citrusy flavor that our family didn't like much. I also baked it immediately while the batter was fluffy and it came out very nice and fluffy.

Really good.  My family loves oatmeal, generally old fashioned, not the quick cooking. Using that kind of oatmeal gave it a hearty, but still moist and yummy texture.  I used cinnamon applesauce in place of the oil.  I used craisins since it was the spur of the moment and that's all we had on hand. 

I would make it again, but I would used less sugar and add vanilla and more dried fruit. This is breakfast on the go or sure.  I baked it in an 8x8 pan and got nine squares/servings. I sent the recipe to mom and sis too!

I made this with slight revisions.  I was looking for a healthy "grab and go" breakfast recipe. I love oatmeal. I reduced the white sugar to 1/2 cup because I am trying to reduce sugar in my diet. I added a shredded granny smith apple, a cup of chopped walnuts, and the zest of a naval orange.  I also added a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon.  This baked nicely. I liked the flavor a lot.  Mine turned out a little crumbly but it tastes good.  I'm going to try it for breakfast this week.  I'm sure it has fewer calories than a donut, and has much more fiber. It was very easy and quick to make.  (I did not refrigerate this overnight). So, I will probably try making it again and continue to tweak the recipe to my taste. I think it tastes fine at room temperature.

Not really crazy about this one - kind of dry.  I guess I'm used to the old fashioned oatmeal.

I made a 1/2 batch and now regret it.  We only have one piece left and only me & my child has had any "today".  I cut the sugar(s) by a 3rd and used mostly brown sugar with a hint of white sugar.  I don't like raisins so I used frozen raspberries and used wild berry applesauce instead of oil.  I also added a little cinnamon to the mixture.  Will definitely be making this on a regular basis.  LOVE IT.  I think of it more as a dessert than a breakfast.  Of course that could be because I topped my daughters with a little cool-whip.  But she loved it without as well.

A different way to prepare oatmeal.  Original recipe does make a big batch, but it tastes just as good as leftovers a few days later. It is nice being able to prep it the night before, so that morning all you need to do is bake it.

I made this for 60 people at a weekend event. I utilised the reviews  suggesting applesauce instead of oil and added grated apples and substituted chopped dates, since I don't like raisins.  We put out bowls of sliced almonds and coconut to top it off, and many put yogurt over it. Everyone loved it! Thanks for all the input!

I used half melted butter, half organic applesauce instead of the full amount of vegetable oil. I cut the sugar back to a scant 1/3 cup and I only used a pinch of salt. I did soak my raisins in hot unsweetened chai tea (I made sure to drain the raisins and pat them dry well before adding them) before adding them to the oatmeal mixture. We all thought this was tasty and quite warm and comforting for a chilly day like today. Next time, I'll use fat free evaporated milk for a creamier texture as well as add a little vanilla extract. I didn't even miss the extra fat in this recipe after substituting half with applesauce and to be honest, I could probably cut it again without missing it. I would have today but I'm completely out. This is almost like rice pudding, only made with oatmeal.

DELICIOUS!! I used applesauce (with cinnamon) instead of oil like most people suggested. I used Almond milk. I omitted raisins and used a handful dried cranberries, diced half a granny smith apple, and another handful of fresh blueberries, used extra cinnamon. Absolutely scrumptious! I will definitely be making this again!

I've made many variations of this yummy breakfast.  I always substitute applesauce for the oil and add apples or peaches just before baking  We like it served with just a touch of milk poured over. One of our favorites is with mixed berries and vanilla instead of cinnamon and raisins. For breakfast on the go - baked as a muffin.  The options are endless!  Even teens and husbands love it!

Delicious!  The only change I made was to use 1/2 cup applesauce rather than oil, just to make it healthier.  It was so yummy coming hot out of the oven with some milk poured on top.  I also like that I can play around with the recipe, adding different fruits and nuts for variety.  Next time I think I'll try using splenda, just to cut down on the calories even more.  Thanks so much for this recipe, its really tasty :)

I LOVE this recipe and I've made it a bunch of times.  Here's what I would say.  It DOES make a big difference when you put the brown sugar and cinnamon on top rather than mixed in.  (I've done both)  This recipe is sooo versatile.  Great for substituting. I've tried craisins and orange zest, dried apples, dried peaches.  I've substituted flavored oatmeal packets for the plain oatmeal.  (leave out the sugar in that case)  This is a really great recipe!  Thank you!!!!

I tweaked the recipe to my tastes and to follow my vegan diet. I was surprised at how awesome this turned out! I used applesauce instead of oil, natural sugar, one whole smashed up banana as substitute for the eggs, 4 tbsp of water, vanilla soy milk, omitted the raisins, and added slivered almonds to the toppings. It was freaking great!

I made this using half oil, half applesauce and replaced raisins with dried cranberries.  I doubled it and brought it to a women's breakfast at church and served it plain (not in milk)  Delicious!!!!!!!!  My kids finished off the leftovers the next morning.  My one-year old loved it, too!  I can't wait to make again.  2nd Review - I made this again this morning for another church event, again doubled, but I didn't have quite enough oats so I ended up using about 2/3 cup of dried, flaked coconut.  I also used the cranberries again - great combination. Everyone loves this!!!!  You don't need butter or milk in my opinion.  It's almost like a coffee cake.

Oh my gosh!  This is so good!  I HATE oatmeal, but I had a bunch laying around the house and needed to eat it.  I substituted apple sauce for the oil, and it came out great and made the house smell good too.  It even tastes good cold!  I feel like I'm eating cake and am now addicted to oatmeal.

I made this with applesauce in place of the oil and brown instead of white sugar, and no raisins. I also just add the cinnamon in the mix rather than try to sprinkle it evenly.   I havent tried to refridgerate it overnight, I just dont plan ahead that much.  I also added fruit - the first time I did blueberries and half plain, the second time I added 1 1/2 bananas and 6 strawberries.  I definitely like the bananas and strawberries better than plain, and the blueberries were good too.  I cover it with milk when I eat it, my toddler eats it straight from the pan (its dense enough to cut up for her to pick up and eat).  Definitely a good recipe - will keep making it.  Works great to reheat the second morning for quick breakfast.  This would be good to feed a crowd if you made a few of them.  Its so easy.

Excellent!  It tasted like an oatmeal cookie. Like other reviewers, I used natural/unsweetened applesauce instead of oil. I didn't have quick oats and used regular oats, so I added about 1/4 cup extra milk. Also switched 1/2 c sugar to brown sugar.  Added a lot of cinnamon, didn't measure, just kept shaking it in the mix.  Made it for breakfast at the office, everyone loved it.

Not bad. We don't eat a lot of oatmeal in the house. This was definitely a good twist. We didn't have raisins on hand but we did have a bag of frozen strawberries that turned out to be delicious in the oatmeal. Will probably make again.

I made this for breakfast this morning, and it is definately a keeper! The only changes I made were to use apple sauce instead of oil, and because we don't have a sweet tooth, I didn't add any sugar (topped it with hot apple sauce in our bowls). It turned out perfect, almost like rice pudding. We loved it, and will be making it for guests in the future! Thanks for a great recipe!

I really liked this. It has a corn bread consistency so it's really good dipped in milk or with a pat of butter. I used half brown & half white sugar in the batter. I also added some vanilla & finely chopped almonds. I sprinkled the top with apple pie spice instead of cinnamon. Next time I will add some of the spice to the batter as well.

My kids and I loved this one! I followed some of the other people's advice and used applesauce instead of the oil. I also used 1/4c. sugar and 1/4c. brown sugar  and used 1/2c. peach juice (just because I had it on hand) and 1/2c. milk. I didn't add any other fruit because I wanted everyone to be able to pick their own fruit on top. We had our with fruit and yogurt on top. I will make this one when the family comes into town next month!

The first time I make a recipe, I normally follow the instructions exactly.  I didn't have any oil so I substituted applesauce.  I also decreased the sugar to 1/4 cup -- 3/4 cup would be way too sweet for us.  With the subs I made it only rates 3 stars but am giving 4 stars because I believe it would have been better with oil or even butter. 
Update 9/3/11:  Made with oil and reduced sugar by 1/2.  It was delicious!

My favorite way to have oatmeal and I try not to reserve it for only when company comes. I increased the number of servings and lessened the amount of sugar. I didn't add the cinnamon or raisins before baking as I like to add them when serving and my husband doesn't like raisins (go figure?) This is a great recipe; thank you Tracy for sharing!

This was tasty but I wish that it had said "overnight" in the preparation/cook time.  I started making this to eat this morning and then realized in the directions that it is supposed to sit overnight.  I decided to just skip that step and it turned out good anyways.  I also subbed applesauce for oil and used splenda for the white sugar.  I also added some sliced almonds on top with the cinnamon and brown sugar.  Overall, a good dish unlike anything I'd ever had.  It reminded us somewhat of a breakfast bread pudding.

Well, I followed the recipe exactly (substituting apple sauce for oil) but my came out extremely dry and crumbly. I added milk to it as if it was dry cereal. The flavor was good, though I would probably cut back on the sugar. If I try again, maybe I'll double the milk and applesauce or bake right away or something to moisten it up. It's filling, I will give it that.

Unbelievably Delicious.  It's what I was looking for in a Baked Oatmeal recipe.  I did substitute the oil with applesauce and also added a little vanilla.  I also backed off a little on the sugar as I didn't want it to be over sweet.  Be sure and let it bake long enough  so that a small amount of crust forms around the edges of the baking dish.  This adds a little extra flavor and the right amount of crunch to the dish.  Makes great leftovers for a quick treat.

Great!  I used applesauce instead of oil, and also added a splash of vanilla...why bake anything without vanilla, right?  I also used dried blueberries instead of raisins.  It was fantastic, and my 2 year old who is very picky gobbled it up.  It was a little too sweet, possibly because of the applesauce and I did not reduce the sugar.  Next time, I will use the applesauce and just half a cup of sugar.

i wanted to use up and not go to store so made some changes-added about half cup of bulgur, 2 mashed bananas, about 1 cup of frozen tiny blueberries (costco), chopped nuts and 2 chopped tangerines.  Cut the oil back to 2 T and used 9 packets of splenda--it was great and i would do it pretty much the same next time--might use a little less splenda--i think the smashed banana was why i could eliminate most of the oil and still moist and wonderful texture bar! i am giving it 4 only because i think the oil and sugar are too much

It was very good. My only changes consisted of no raisins (we don't like) and only 2 tab of oil. I'll try it again with no oil and egg beaters as others have suggested. My picky 11 yr old daughter ate it for breakfast this morning with no reservations. Thanks for the recipe!

This was so good!  I halved it for my small family and baked it in a pyrex for 30 minutes, after letting it sit at room temp while the oven preheated.  I also made the unsweetened applesauce for oil substitution.  Next time, I think I'll add less sugar to the mix as it was a bit too sweet to feel healthy :)

Fabulous recipe, and very easy.  Scaled down to 6 servings and it fit nicely in a pie dish.  Made it last night and refrigerated overnight, then put started in a cold oven and baked at 350 for half an hour.  Made a few substitutions/additions following others' reviews: applesauce in place of oil, added a diced fresh peach.  Has a muffin-y texture.  Ate some with milk, but I think I'll eat it plain next time.  Delicious!

Since I don't care much for oatmeal I was surprised by how much I like this. I omitted the rasins and accidently added nutmeg. I think the nutmeg was a good touch. I will make this again.

I Made this recipe for my husband is a rather picky eater.  To my shock, HE LOVED IT!!!  All I did different was use chocolate covered raisan because they were all I had handy.  I also used applesause instead of oil (that is a standard for me).  I was going to reheat the rest for breakfast the next day, but when I got home, he was finishing it off as a "snack"!  Thanks so much for the great starter!!!!! ;)

This is a terrific breakfast treat! I eliminate the brown sugar and use only the cinnamon for topping.  Otherwise it is too sweet for me.  I also use regular oats and the result is a nicer texture.

This is my second review for this recipe.  I thought I'd give my opinion since this time I made it exactly like the recipe and the first time I changed it.  I like my changes better.  It was a bit dry when I followed the recipe exactly.  My favorite version which I would give 5 stars is: 1/3c. melted margarine, 1/3 c. cinnamon applesauce, 1/4c. sugar, 1/4c. brown surgar.  Mix cinnamon with rest of ingredients, and didn't sprinkle with more sugar.  Deleat the oil, change the suger and make the rest of the recipe the same. Husband likes more brown sugar when serving with milk.  I just like milk.

VERY TASTY!!!  Here are some ways to make it even better:  cut back on sugar to 3/4 cup mixed white and brown; add one mashed ripe banana; add 1/2 tsp vanilla; add handful of dried cherries instead of raisins; to topping, sprinkle with 1/2 cup chopped pecans or walnuts.

I'm not an oatmeal eater but this was very good--a little too sweet but good. Next time I will cut down on the sugar as some have suggested since we all have individual taste. Thank you for a great morning recipe, especially for people who are in a hurry but want something healthy for their kids to eat.

Just for a little twist, I substituted some brown sugar for the white and added chocolate chips.  It makes a yummy dessert.  You just need to add some ice cream!

The recipe was really good.  Perhaps I will try maybe adding a little more milk to make it a little moister (that's just how I like it)!  But other than that, it was really a treat and I would definately make this again!

This was delicious.  I used old fashioned oats and it turned out like a crumbled oatmeal cookie, but softer.  Its not mushy oatmeal...more like hot granola.  My family really loved it.  I recommend that you try it!  An easy and different alternative healthy breakfast.

We tried this the first time and loved it.  We have experimented by adding different spices and some fruits to make it a new taste adventure each time.  Wonderful for our cold Wisconsin winter of 2000-2001.

Wonderful breakfast. I make it for my guests at our Bed & Breakfast every week and it always gets the best reviews. I always make it with a bit of cinnamon and chopped apple. I don't have quick oats available in Spain, so I use the normal, heavy duty oats and after a night of soaking they turn out perfect. My guests like it best with sweetened yogurt on top!

Fantastic base recipe. Made this for Mother's Day brunch and it was a hit. I made a few changes: I followed the other rater's suggestions and substituted the applesauce for the oil and reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup. I also subbed soy milk for cow's milk, since I had a guest who is lactose intolerant. I also subbed out raisins for dried cranberries and added in some sliced almonds. Several guests requested the recipe. It was a great make-ahead recipe that came in very handy. Thanks!

I added 2 fresh apples diced to this and 1/4 tsp on ground cloves. 
I added 1 Tbsp of vanilla but probable will omit that next time as I think it takes away from the cinnamon taste.   

If you double the recipe I believe they come out too moist more like cake... I wanted bars so I will not double again :)  Either way they were good and I will try again.  Next time I am doing 1 cup blueberry oatmeal bars with 1/2 cup cranberries or cherries :) Adding 1 Tbsp Vanilla & Omitting the cinnamon.  Or I might try the oatmeal blueberry muffins on this site!

Yum!  I used steel cut oats since I didn't have quick oats on hand so the texture wasn't very kid friendly, but it tasted just like an oatmeal cookie.  I will only make it as a special treat because of all the sugar content!

My first time trying baked oatmeal... I guess maybe I'm just not a fan? It's pretty dense and not much flavor even though I added extra cinnamon and sugar.

This was very easy to make and very tasty! I did not prepare it the day before, and substituted applesauce for all but about 2 Tbs of oil. I threw in a few packets of flavored oatmeal because I needed to use them up, and didn't add any sugar. A great basic recipe that can be modified any way you want!

This was a fantastic recipe. This could pass for a dessert, too. I added chopped walnuts and subbed in craisins because I didn't have raisins handy. Was still delicious!

I thought this was a delicious twist to traditional oatmeal. I really enjoyed it, and definitely will be making it again. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because I wish it was a little more dense, it's more of a cake like baked oatmeal.

Really easy to make and very good!  I used applesauce in place of the oil and lowered the white sugar to 1/2 cup. Otherwise, I followed the recipe.  My 8yo daughter loved it and she is the oatmeal eater in our house.  My son ate half of the square I gave him and said it's "not good" but he does not like oatmeal so for him to eat ANY of it says something positive for this recipe!  Thanks for sharing it!

absolutely delicious! I would most DEFINITELY decrease the sugar in this though. WAY too sweet for my taste. I also added sliced apples before i baked it, in addition to the raisins, and it was a tasty addition.

I definately didn't like this, even though I used an extra cup of milk since I used old fasioned oats, it was still too dry. I had to bake an extra 10-15 min. and it still didn't get firm in the middle. Also even though I reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup, I felt it was still too sweet. Oatmeal is so quick and easy to fix, why go to the bother of fixing it the night before plus heating the oven for 45 min. when you can fix it stove top for approx 5 min. max My husband took it to his monthly mens breakfast and brought half back. Those guys usually devour anything I send, so due to this plus my own feelings I rate it 3 stars

This is to die for good! It is definitly not the healthiest breakfast because of the oil and sugar, but if you want something that tastes great, this is the recipe for you. I did modify the recipe a little. I added chopped apples and substituted 1/4 cup of brown sugar for the white sugar. Also placed a few slats of butter on top before baking.

I really like this recipe.  I was looking for a way to make oatmeal more delish... and this was perfect.  I made a fairly good quantity on a Sunday, cut it up and stored it in a refrigerator.  For the next couple of days, I just took out a slice and added some warm milk to it.  With some fruits, this made a healthy, delicious breakfast for days!!!

I had no idea how this was going to turn out or taste but I was really happy with the end result. I modified the recipe for health reasons (applesauce instead of oil, egg beaters, 1/2 cup sugar) and I thought it turned out great. I also used another reviewers recommendation and added frozen blueberries. I will definitely make this one again!

Excellent! This was delicious.  I did make a few tweaks though. I had to half the recipe because I was the only one eating it. I used all natural apple sauce instead of the oil. I drizzled some vanilla extract into the mixture and put the cinnamon in the mixture as opposed to sprinkling on top. I only baked it for 25 mins.  I also put a little bit of milk in the bottom of the bowl when I dished it up. Maybe 2-3 tablespoons. Perfection!

YUM.  I didn't modify the recipe for healthy-ness at all, just taste - 1/4 c. white sugar and 1/2 c. brn sugar, old fashioned oats and a dash or two of nutmeg.  Served hot with peach amaretto preserves and milk poured over the top.  Again, YUM.  Will be making this again... probably a healthier version for most occasions.

Yummy!  Did as many and exchanged oil for applesauce, used splenda, add cinnamon to mix, omitted raisins (preferance).  Cut in squares, added milk on top.  My 18 month old gobbled it up.  Super nice to throw together the night before when you know it will be a busy morning!

This recipe was delicious!  It was just what I was looking for and especially helpful because it could be made up the night before and then baked in the morning.  Very helpful with my early mornings!  I cut the recipe in half and used chopped apples instead of raisins.  It turned out great, and I will definitely make this again!

This was delicious. I always order baked oatmeal at a country restaurant near my home (it's their breakfast specialty) and this recipe was even better than theirs.  I did not put the brown sugar on top and it was plenty sweet without it. Also, I used dried cranberries instead of raisins.

This was delicious!  I've already made it twice this week.  The first time I made it the night before, the second time I made it and put it straight in the oven.  Both times were excellent!  The butter on top makes it even better if possible.

Yum! If this held together more, it'd be perfect for a breakfast bar.  I substituted soy milk for milk, but it's not really worth it because you can hardly taste it.  I also cut the oil in half and it was just as great. I thought it was a little too sweet for breakfast food but everyone enjoyed and thought it was fine.

My family members are oatmeal haters so I didn't think they'd eat this recipe. Granddaughter didnt gobble it down but she did at least eat it. On the other hand, I loved it. Yum yum yum..I've never much cared for the texture of hot oatmeal but this is more like a cookie in a bowl.  I tried it with milk over it and without milk. Loved it both ways! Looking forward to my morning oatmeal tomorrow morning. I used 1/4 c white suger and 1/2 c of brown sugar. I also mixed the cinnamon up with the other dry ingredients instead of sprinkling it on top. It was sooooo good!

I love this recipe. I make it at home for breakfast, I double it to take to my 3 year old son's class for morning snack, I'll have it as an anytime snack, I absolutely love it. I put my personal touch on it and alter some of the ingredients: I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup (which is plenty), use butter in place of the oil (great flavor!) and omit the raisins (don't like em). Sometimes I'll add pear or apple chunks and I'm sure it'll work well with other fruit. I've prepared this the night before as well as the same day and didn't notice a difference in the finished oatmeal. Also, after it's baked, I'll pour an additional 1/4 cup or so of milk over the top - it's a little crumbly otherwise. This is a great recipe that I'll make over and over again.

This was really good, although not what I expected.  I will make this again with some alterations (mix in the cinnamon and brown sugar, and not do it the night before: I think that made it too dry).  Thanks for a yummy breakfast!

Very good. I didn't refrigerate leftovers, just wraped it in plastic and ate it cold the next day like a muffin. My husband had the leftovers with milk and heated in the microwave. Both ways were great.

This oatmeal is wooooooooonderful! It's easy and my 1 yr old loves it, and I do too!!! I will say that in my experience it doesn't keep well.. it just doesn't taste right when you reheat it.

I like oatmeal and I did not like this. I thought it was really dry. To me the point of eating oatmeal is that it's healthy, and this had tons of sugar but somehow came out bland. I will not make it again. :(

Being new to oatmeal, i was delighted to find this recipe, and even happier with the result. The butter over the hot oatmeal really made it for me, next time i'm gonna try a flavoured butter.

I haven't eaten oatmeal since I was six years old.I thought that after forty two years, I'd give it a second chance. I cannot believe it!! "Mikey, She likes it!!" It was delish. My husband liked it too.And oh so easy to prepare.

YUMMMMY! I have three kids plus we had three other kids over and everyone loved it! The only problem was that with these kids it was nowhere near 8 servings. I will make a double batch next time! Thanks for the good easy recipe.

"Mom, this is REALLY GOOD oatmeal!"  Haha, first time my kids have ever said that!  They even had seconds!  I substituted 1 cup of applesauce (sweetened) for the oil.  Since the applesauce was already sweet, I reduced the sugar to 1/4 Cup.  I substituted Craisins for the raisins and almond milk for the milk.  Everything else was the same.  Since so many of the reviews said it came out dry, I only baked it for 20 minutes.  The edges were cake like, but the inside was still soft.  I had to scoop it out instead of slice and serve.  Next time I will cook it a little longer.   Oh, and with the leftovers, I added a large scoop of crunchy peanut butter, mixed it in thoroughly, lined a pan with parchment, smashed the mixture in nice and tight and baked it on 250 until it was dry and toasty, sliced it when it was warm.  Ta Da!  Energy bars for growing kids!

Great recipe, especially with applesauce & flax substitutes for most of the oil. We add 1 tsp cinnamon, skip the topping, bake right away, and then add fixin's when it is baked. Fits nicely into an 8x8 or a deep dish pie plate.

I just made this on the spur of the moment, so it didn't get to sit in the refrigerator overnight, but it was still great.  I did use only 1/2 cup sugar, as I usually cut back on how much is in a recipe, and I'm glad I did.  It was a little crumbly, but that was just fine for us. This is going to be a regular week end breakfast dish.

This is delicious. I normally detest oatmeal, but this is amazing! My four kids (from 16months old to ten years) all enjoyed it, as well as my husband. simple, sweet, and very filling. I like that it can be mixed the night before and baked in the morning so my family can have a hot breakfast before school. I followed the recipe exactly with no modifications and it is perfect.

This was more like oatmeal cake than oatmeal cereal. Mine turned out very dry and really needed some cream or milk. I topped with butter but it still needed some type of sauce to help with moisture. The flavor was good and it was something really different for breakfast. Neither one of us was impressed enough to want this again. I used quick cooking oats and did not soak this overnight. I felt like this would be better suited with vanilla ice cream as a dessert. I did enjoy trying out a new recipe. Thanks for sharing this tasty dish.

Great basic recipe! We used old fashioned rolled oats instead of instant, skipped the soaking step, and still had great results. A bit sweet for our tastes - will reduce sugar in the future, we also prefer canned peaches and a tsp vanilla instead of raisins for flavor. Yum!

This was a great weekend breakfast. Thoroughly enjoyed it. I counted this as a "cheat" breakfast since it was Saturday.  Next I'm going to try to reduce the sugar amount or use alternative sweeteners to make it a little lighter. But you should always follow the recipe the first time and I was not disappointed by this one. Definitely a keeper.

First time ever having, or even hearing of, baked oatmeal. First note : this will not fit in a pie pan, I used a baking dish approx 9x9x2 in. It was really good. I didn't know how you were 'supposed to' eat it, so i had it hot, hot with milk, cold, and cold with milk. I preferred the cold with milk. Could make this a hundred ways, next time i will double the cinnamon sugar topping, double the raisins, and add walnuts. For anyone who has never tried this dish, the texture is kind of like a moist cake but a little on the gummy side when you chew it. I would have never even known it was oats in there if I hadn't made it myself. Thanks for the recipe!!

Sugary-sweet! I even halved the sugar (and used agave instead, maybe it's like honey and is sweeter?) But even with 1/2 the sugar it was fantastic.

Husband's fave oatmeal. Substituted: applesauce for oil; half the amount of sugar with turbinado; flax in warm water for eggs. Used less brown sugar and added chopped dried, tart cherries and walnuts. Yummers. Great on a Sunday morning.uu

I was out of brown sugar so I omitted it, and I slightly decreased the white sugar as well. It was still fantastic!

Awesome!!  I used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 regular and 1/2 quick-cooking oats.  I also left out the raisins.  Served it a bit of milk and a drizzle of the sauce from the Sauteed Apples by Tricia Jaegar on this site (made with apple cider instead of water and 4 t. cornstarch instead of 2 t.)  My family is never eating regular oatmeal again!  Now, I just need to figure out how to make it in my slow cooker so I don't have to wait for it in the morning!

This was just ok. I didn't think it was very flavorful. I ended up eating a serving, but my husband and 2 year old didn't like it at all. I will stick with regular oatmeal.

Wow, this is so good!  I made this for the first time for a weekend breakfast for my family.  I wasn't sure how well it would go over since it is oatmeal - not exactly my son's favorite.  Also, he had a couple of friends sleep over (11 yr olds).  I knew I could whip up some pancakes if it wasn't good.  The kids loved it!  It is similar in taste to oatmeal cookies right out of the oven.  It's so easy since it is mixed up the night before.  We have since had it again on a busy school morning.   I get up to walk the dogs before my kids, so I put it in the oven before I leave. By the time I return and wake up the kids, it is just about ready.  Just take it out of the oven, put some bread in the toaster and breakfast is ready! It's a really good start to the day!

I was really surprised at how delicious this recipe is. I made it for overnight guests and they went nuts for it.  I doubled the recipe and they ate the entire first batch for breakfast.  My husband came home late that night and ate almost 1/2 the second batch and he is not a big sweet eater.  I made the recipe exactly as written switching only cranraisins for raisins and added a bit of chopped pecan for texture. This is a new family recipe.  Thank you!!!

I made it this morning, it was pretty good.  I'm sure it would have been better if the whole dish was moist.  I'm sure it was b/c I had to use a 13X9 (next smallest available) since the 8X8, per other reviews, would have been too small.  I will definitely make this again.  Next time I will cut back on the sugar, try different fruit, and let it set over night.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was good, but not sweet enough to me. Next time, I'm going to add even more cinnamon (I used a whole tablespoon) and use a cup of Splenda instead of the sugar. I made mine in a 5 x 9 pan. I should have cut the amount or used a bigger pan. It really expanded as it cooked and I thought it was a little too thick.

Sounded like a cool recipe but we were disappointed.  Good flavor but dry and crumbly. Not worth the effort. Sorry, not a keeper.

YUMMY! No one in the family is a huge Oatmeal fan, but we all loved this. I went with the suggestion of using applesauce instead of oil and the consistency was perfect. Next time I will try less sugar as it was a little sweet. Thank you for sharing.

No everyone in our family likes oatmeal, but they will eat it when I cook this!  We had a similar recipe served to us while on vacation, and the kids have been asking me to make it ever since.  I found this recipe and it satisfied their picky taste buds!  My teenage son is already asking me to make it again.

This is a good recipe for baked oatmeal. I used an 8x8 Pyrex dish (didn't do overnight, just all at once) and it cooked up fine but the pieces were quite a bit thicker than I had anticipated. I'd make this again, but probably halve the recipe for just us. Still, this did yield leftovers for tomorrow's breakfast, which is always nice! Thanks for the recipe.

This is a really good alternative to traditional oatmeal. I was able to get my 12 year old to eat it and he usually refuses oatmeal all together.  Next time I plan to try dried cranberries!!

It's only my husband and I so I make half of the recipe, which will last for two meals.  I will refrigerate the leftovers and reheat them in the microwave for breakfast the next day.  I have used blackberries and strawberries, and both are wonderful.  I make this recipe twice a week!  I also serve it with a little cream on top and drink a glass of milk with it.

I love love love this and make it quite often. So many mentioned using applesauce instead of the oil and it totally changes the taste of this dish. I haven't done the overnight thing either and it always comes out perfect, also I double it for our 7 kids, and everyone loves it.  Cannot go wrong with this one!

I initially made this recipe the way it's written minus the extra sugar on the top.  It was good.  I then tried a few suggestions in other reviews, and now replace all of the oil with unsweetened applesauce, reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup and add 1 cup of raisins (personal preference) and it's great.  You can always add more sugar after baking, so cutting back on that is easy.  I served it with extra brown sugar and toasted pecans on the side - my B&B guests liked it and several wanted the recipe.  I'll be making this again!

Wow!  This is a great way to eat oatmeal, even my hubby who hates oatmeal likes this one!  I used 1/4 C coconut oil and 1/4 C applesauce instead of veg. oil.  Mostly brown sugar, only 1/4 C white sugar, and added vanilla.  It's super flexible too, if you want to add a can of diced peaches or cut up apples it only makes it better.  I love how it keeps well in the fridge for a few days worth of breakfasts with only needing to be reheated.

I'm so confused on how to rate this. The texture was odd and different than I expected, almost crumbly but moist at the same time. The being said, the flavor was great. My 7 year old took a bite and turned up her nose, and then proceeded to pick at it until it was completely gone. I used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white and upped the cinnamon. I am going to make it again and used applesauce and chopped apples as suggested by other reviewers.

This was really good and the texture was SO much better than plain oatmeal, which I don't care for.  The kids loved it as well, and they all like oatmeal.  I baked mine right after mixing so I don't know how different the texture would be letting it sit overnight.  I cut the calories way down by using applesauce & Splenda in place of the oil & sugar and also used skim milk.  I left out the raisins and added about a half cup of chopped walnuts.  Next time I want to add a chopped apple or two and a little more cinnamon but it is quite tasty as is.

Followed reviewers' suggestions - less sugar (used Splenda) added drained canned peaches. Served hot with some yogurt on top. Bacon and cut up fruit on the side. My guest loved it and wanted the recipe.

I have made this three times since I found the recipe 4 days ago. Wonderful flavor and texture. Just make sure to heat up the milk a bit before putting it in the bowl! I found it cooled it down a little too much, so warming it up kept everything warm and delicious. Also, the second time I made it I lined a casserole dish with apples, and that worked really well. Thanks for the recipe!

I too applesauce instead of oil.  I also used 1 egg and 1 egg white and cut the sugar to 1/2 too.  I think next time I might try putting it in a 9x11 pan because was wishing it would turn out a little more crispy instead of caky.  I wonder if peanut butter might also be a good substitute for the oil as well.  My kids didn't like how the milk added made it a bit too mushy.  I had it with applesauce on top and LOVED it!  I look forward to trying it again and tweaking it some more until perfect.

I wasn't completely fond of this recipe.  I followed everyone's advice and only added 1/2 of the sugar.  I didn't feel like it was sweet enough.  It was a little dry too.  I also didn't add any raisins, only because I didn't have any.  It was ok, but I won't be making it again unless I do a few different changes.

This is a wonderful recipe!!  I had baked oatmeal at a friends on New Years Eve, and had to have the recipe so I searched this website.  I did make a couple of changes because I try to eat organic.  So, coconut oil instead of veg. oil, 2 tbsp cinnamon in the mix, dash of vanilla extract in mix, split 1/2 br. sugar, 1/2 raw cane sugar, and subsituted rice milk for milk.  It came out light and moist with hint of sweetness.  Next time I will add sauteed apples or some berries...yum, yum!!!   Thank you

This was great! I'm on a strict no-dairy, no-soy diet, and was thrilled to find this recipe, which modified so easily! I subbed rice milk for the cow's milk, and I promise you couldn't taste the difference. Even my husband loved it, and he's pretty picky about that. I also swapped the raisins out for frozen raspberries, and grated an apple into the batter. Like others I cut the sugar in half and didn't top with sugar. Everyone that tried it thought it was plenty sweet. I love how easy this recipe is to modify to your own tastes. And it's really tasty!

Oatmeal for breakfast is a daily ritual for me, so I am always looking for new recipes. This was exactly what I had been looking for. I changed it a bit by eliminating the oil and using my homemade applesauce in its' place; also cut out white sugar and add 1/4 cup of brown sugar; add 1/4 cup of ground flaxseed for added health benefit and a little more of cinnamon. Sometimes, I add a chopped apple or I add a handful or two of raisins. We like our oatmeal with lots of milk poured over. YUMMY!  Even my 16 yoa daughter loves it!
Thanks for a great recipe!

We loved it. I did use Thick Rolled Oats instead of quick cooking oats and 1 1/4 c. milk, 1/4 c. blueberries, small nectarine chopped up into bite size pieces, and 1/4 c. walnuts.  I did by accident cook it longer 50-60 min. and it turned out with a slightly crunchy golden crust that was delightful served in a bowl with 1/2 c. milk.  An excellent nutritious breakfast.

Turned out very good. It is very cake-like. Instead of 2 whole eggs I used four egg whites. I also used applesauce instead of oil. Yummy, my family loved it.

I have used this recipe 3 times, 3 different ways.  I work at a camp and baked it for 100...They ate it all!  I use applesauce instead of oil and I didn't have raisins at the time so I chopped up apples. When serving you can put it in a bowl and just add milk or you can eat it cold for a snack.  My kids, husband and I love it. I've also made it with raisins and apples. Next time I'm going to try peaches or blueberries...Thanks for the recipe!

I double this recipe for a 9X13 pan.  I usually add vanilla and maple extracts and then some cinnamon.  I keep a pan of this in the fridge for our breakfast every morning.  Just heat it up in the microwave with milk for a great and filling breakfast.  Much cheaper and healthier than cereal.

Yummy!  This was very tasty.  It was very hearty and healthy.  I did use applesauce (instead of oil) and decreased the sugar to 1/4 cup.  The entire house smelled so good while it was baking.

So Yummy! I substituted the raisins with apples and I only had one egg and it still turned out oh so delicious! My kids are gobbling it up as I type this! Mine did turn out a little dry but I put milk on the top of ours and it was then perfect! Will definitely make again- love it!
Try this with blueberries! It's even better!

this one's a keeper. i made the full 8 serving size just to try it out - next time i will have to scale down for my family of 2. i forgot how filling oatmeal can be! it firmed up nicely in my 9" cake pan (i dont have pie pan).
i used applesauce instead of oil, and decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup. omitted brown sugar topping, but did sprinkle cinnamon on top. even with cutting down the white sugar and omitting the brown sugar topping, it was quite sweet but not overwhelming (especially when you get a bite of raisin). next time will blend cinnamon into the mixture as well. i plan to try this next time with apples instead of (or maybe in addition to?) the raisins. this was very good cut into wedges and eat with milk. yum!

This was good. I didn't find the idea of vegetable oil appetizing so I used melted butter. I also added more liquid than called for and ended up with a set but spoonable consistency. I used a chopped granny smith apple in it and that tasted good.

I love this stuff!  I can't actually make it that often because I go through it way too fast.  It's great right out of the oven, but also at room temperature or even cold.  I put together a half-recipe last night and popped it in the oven on my way to the bathroom this morning.  By the time I finished my shower, my apartment smelled like cinnamon and I had breakfast -- and dessert for after lunch and dinner!  I love spooning a little yogurt over the top: vanilla is good, and so is plain yogurt mixed with maple syrup.

variations: I didn't add the topping, because I think it's plenty sweet without it.  I used about half white sugar and half brown, and also added about half a teaspoon of cinnamon and a quarter-teaspoon of nutmeg.

I eat oatmeal everyday for breakfast so it was a nice change. It was very good, just a bit too sweet and I love sweets! Next time I will reduce the sugar by half. I also substituted the oil for applesauce and used only egg whites. I added pecans and frozen strawberries. Very tasty! I will probably have this once a week now.

I'm not much of an oatmeal eater, and I thought this tasted great.  Subbed "Craisins" (sweet., dried cranberries) for raisins and used reg. old-fashioned oats.  Topped each serving with a little butter.  We loved it.

This was very easy to make.  It tasted very much like oatmeal cookies.  I did alter it a little as I didn't have quite enough oats.  I substituted about 1 cup of baby oatmeal cearal instead.  This probably changed the texture but I would make this same substitution again.  I also used dried apricots instgead of raisins.  It was yummy.

Made this for a family brunch and really liked the small piece I ate--my dad alone ate almost half the pan!  I didn't have raisins on hand so I used shredded apple and added some cinnamon to the actual oat mix as well, and I think it turned out nicely.  I will try substituting applesauce next time in an effort to make it healthier as well.  This dish has a very comforting taste to it and I will be making it again definitely!

I came home for college one night, and baking is sort of my stress reliever, but unfortunately, because I had come home every weekend for the past 3 months, we were out of flour.  Fortunately, I found this recipe and made it for the family.  They ate it sooo fast...I didn't even get to try it, but I heard the raves.  Really, try it.  GREAT recipe!  It was actually kind of funny.  I walked out of my bedroom, and I had left the oatmeal cooling on the counter.  My whole family was gathered around eating it and just looking at me.  They were like, "Why didn't you TELL us you made this?  This is AMAZING!"  I really wasn't expecting anyone to eat it because it's OATMEAL.  I just made it because it was fast and wouldn't make a big mess, and like I said, cooking is my comfort.

I personally didnt care for it because it came out dry, but everyone else liked it. I love raisins in my oatmeal so I doubled the raisins. I might try it again but Im going to soak the raisins in boiling water so they dont absorb all the liquid.

This was a big hit at a brunch and the small amount of leftovers was a hit at home.  I served it with half and half on the side.  I would make this again!

This was a wonderful recipe.  My kids even ate it and they are picky.  I did change a few things though.  I only added 1/2 cup of white sugar and I also used applesauce instead of the oil.  I didn't sprinkle any brown sugar on top, just the cinnamon.  I also chopped up an apple and added it in addition to the rasins. It was wonderful.  We ate it with a little butter and maple syrup on top.  I also enjoyed it in a bowl with milk.  Great recipe.  I will defintiely make this one again.

I was not as impressed with this dish, which surprised me from the great rating everyone gave it. I imagined this tasting more like a healthy cookie, but it tasted more like a toasted bowl of oatmeal. I won't be making this again. I will have to search for something else!

YUMMY! I saw this and it caught my eye because its something i could make at night while I had lots of energy and throw it in the oven in the morning! I LOVED this!! Its super easy and super good. Just like home made oatmeal. My husband liked it and best of all, my 14 month old son ate a while bowl too! (I omitted raisins because I was planning on giving it to him.) Try this recipe, definitely try it. I used an 8x8 square glass pan to soak it in all night and then baked it, cut into perfect squares, a little island in milk in your bowl. Perfect!

I made this with Old Fasioned oats instaed of instant and it was delicious.  The oats were very chewy, which I liked.  My family thought that it was very good as well.  It was good alone or in a bowl with milk on top.

As many reviews stated, you can add almost anything to this recipe. With our appetities, we could not get 8 servings, so adjust accordingly.
This is a definete keeper.

The flavor of this was really good and I think  adding apples or even walnuts would be yummy. It is very dry and crumbly however. I took one of the other reviewers suggestions and substituted 1/2 C butter for the oil. I don't know if that made it drier. I heated a square of this in the morning and then poured milk over it and it's very good that way. I will try this again, maybe with the oil this time.

This is a great variation to plain oatmeal breakfast. I cut back on the oil by 1/2 and added a bit more milk, so it wouldn't be as dry...and I'd like to try chopped apples - a recipe I will always keep handy.

This was not what I was expecting but I really liked it. It was a little bit like oatmeal muffins, not gooey like you expect. I served mine with Cinnabutter (from this site) and a little milk. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing.

This was a pretty good breakfast.  Not very hard at all.  I used splenda in place of sugar and a egg substitute so it would be healthier.  They worked very well.

This was too, too good! I made it last night and baked it this morning as specified and it came out perfectly! I ate two small pieces early this morning and 4 hours later, I am still full. The only thing I changed was to add only a 1/4 cup of white sugar and 1/4 cup of brown sugar instead of the 3/4 cup white specified. I will definitely be making this one again.

This was delicious!  I chose it over the other recipe because I could just pop it in the oven in the AM.  I only added 1/4 cup white sugar and the rest brown.  I also put in some vanilla extract, maple syrup, and lots more brown sugar on top.  I cant wait to make this for my parents!

I had no expectations from this recipe going in but had lots of oats around my house and wanted to use them up so this looked as good as any.  WOW! What a great surprise.  I loved this.  If I had more time before work I would have eaten the whole pan of it.  My wife had a so-so reaction to it but I thought it was fantastic.  I rarely sit and eat breakfast before work but I had to have two bowls of this.  Very good!

I'd had this years ago and lost the recipe.  It's great.  I share the recipe with people all the time.  I prefer less white sugar and more brown sugar, and sometimes use applesauce instead of the oil, but one way or another, it's great.

We loved this. I didn’t have any applesauce or pumpkin to sub for the oil (as I usually do) so I cut up an apple into small slices and used only 2 tablespoons of olive oil. I also used only 1 tablespoon of white sugar. I added a teaspoon of vanilla as advised by other reviews. The only reason I didn’t give this recipe 5 stars is because it’s rather bland. That being said, we both thought it was sweet enough without all the sugar and it was plenty moist without the oil. Next time I may add fresh berries to it prior to cooking. That should kick up the flavor a notch.

This is my go-to recipe for when we do brunch for family.  Easy to whip together the night before and then toss in the oven while you're getting ready in the AM.  Also great for taking to a potluck.  Everybody loves it!  So soft and cakelike.  You can totally jazz it up with nuts, craisins, whatever you fancy.

It's a great start to a recipe. Like other, I sub out the veggie oil for apple sauce. I put in a 1/4 c sugar with a couple of tsp of Molasses, but next time I will use brown sugar. I also put 2-3 tsp of cinnamon and a tsp of ground cloves. Cinnamon is known to be a great sugar reducer with it's natural flavor, so I like to have a bit more of it and lower the sugar content.  I actually DO NOT make it the night before, but put it in the oven right away and I don't notice any difference. I like to make a double batch and then I have the next morning's breakfast already done. I top mine with Honey Greek Yogurt for the kids, so I really don't need the oatmeal sweet at all b/c of the yogurt's strong sweetness.

So, I made this this morning not knowing that it may/may not have  to sit overnight in the comfort of my fridge or what have you but I made it anyway. I must say, I was unprepared for how delicious this was going to be. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

For a sweeter baked oatmeal, I make as is (except I use applesauce instead of oil for almost all my baking). It is delish! For a healthier breakfast, I substitute the sugar for maple syrup and I add whatever frozen fruit I have at the moment. This recipe is so good, any way I choose to make it!

In a world where this recipe exists (as well as some extra vanilla), I do not know why overnight oats still do.

I found it to be oily & too sweet. Will definitely replace oil with applesauce like other reviewers suggested if I make it again.

This is a staple at our house. I make it every week, usually doubling the recipe so we can eat it for 2-3 days. We use it instead of breakfast cereal, pouring milk over the top. We vary the mix-ins, often using berries instead of raisins (mulberries are our favorite). I leave off the cinnamon-sugar topping because it's sweet enough without it.

This was amazing! I did tweek it! I added 1/2 cup coconut oil instead. I added 1 cup unsweetened almond milk. I also added 1/4 c maple syrup and 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of white sugar. I also added 2 tsp cinnamon 1 tsp vanilla and 1/4 tsp nutmeg. yummy and moist with a little light whipped topping on top!

I made this for myself and my two grandkids. I cut the recipe in half, as this makes quite a lot. I also added some chopped walnuts. It was very fast to put together and filled the house with a lovely aroma of cinnamon. 
It is delicious alone, but is one of those dishes that opens itself for additions.  My grand-daughter  loves the "left-overs" topped with fresh banana as an after-school snack.

Made this for hungry swim team! I easily doubled it and substituted apples for the raisins. They loved it. I would make it again. It really was SO nice to make it the night before and pop in the oven in the AM. They only thing I added was some brown sugar in the mixture plus sprinkled on top. I think you can be creative on adding ingredients as long as you are careful to make adjustments on the liquids. I didn't need to with the apples, though. It should be pretty soupy when you put it in the fridge so it doesn't get dry when you bake it. It was pretty firm when done, but not too dry. It will be on my go-to list for early morning breakfasts for non-egg eaters.

I make this all the time! I've made it as is and then I would get creative with the add-ins. I would do blueberries or maybe strawberries. I've done caramel apple and maple pecan. I'm going to try dried cranberries and walnuts with a little melted white chocolate chips drizzled lightly on top. The options with this recipe is endless! Can't wait!

My whole family enjoyed this oatmeal.  I made it the first time exactly as written and it was great.  The second time I subbed Splenda for the sugar and dried cranberries for the raisins and it was still delicious, and with fewer calories.

Here are the changes I made:
I used honey instead of sugar, coconut oil instead of vegetable oil and almond milk instead of regular milk.  I added frozen berries (about two cups) as well as chopped walnuts.  I also added almond extract instead of vanilla but you can use either one.  It is just me who eats it so after it bakes and cools, I cover it and put in the fridge.  Each morning I cut out a section and reheat for about one minute in the microwave for a quick healthy breakfast before leaving for work.  It is delicious and you can vary the recipe to include any ingredients you like.  Very easy to make as well.

I make this almost every weekend! I mix up the fruits every time too, and it's always delicious.  I add cinnamon to the batter and on top before baking.  Instead if the oil I use applesauce.  Great recipe.

I put in 1/2 cup of white sugar instead of the 3/4 cup. I omitted the raisins.  I reduced the brown sugar.  I used Penzeys Chinese Cassia Cinnamon.  Instead of a pie pan, I used an 8x8 inch ceramic dish.  I took it out early when it was firm to touch in the middle and edges were browning.  I ate it warm with butter, milk and fresh blueberries.  It was very good and I liked the wonderful cinnamon smell while baking.  I will heat left-overs in micro or the oven.  I will bake this recipe again.

Great easy breakfast. I use applesauce instead of oil and change up the raisins with dried cranberries or frozen fruit( strawberries/blueberries) and also add a touch of vanilla. Freeze your leftovers in single serve quantities and warm up later with a little cream on top!

Delicious, especially with some vanilla yogurt over top in place of milk.  I also substituted apple sauce for 1/2 of the oil and cut sugar down by 1/3.  Will go down to 1/2 the sugar next time.  Added diced apples, planning to use homemade chunky applesauce next time, too.

I love this recipe! It's so easy to make and replace ingredients. I can tailor it to the likes of my family (plain for my youngest, variety of fruits for the rest of us). I don't even make it the night before. I just throw it all together in the morning and pop it in the oven. I can even do it on weekday mornings and it's great for a filling breakfast before work and school for all of us!

This oatmeal comes out great every time.  It's not too mushy, as some baked oatmeal recipes turn out.  Fresh fruit on the top is a nice addition.

Great, subbed in applesauce for oil. Looking forward to trying out different add ins.

Forgot sugar one time, blue berries and strawberries mixed in were sweet enough no one said anything.  I typically halve sugar for this one anyways.

Only reason I am rating 4 stars is bc of all the changes I made.  I used flavored instant oatmeal packets for this, so I omitted the white sugar, the cinnamon, and the salt.  I also added mixed dried fruit instead of raisins and added a chopped fresh peach and a chopped fresh apple, as well as 1 mashed banana, and substituted the oil for apple sauce.  I added a sprinkling of flour to make up for the fresh fruit, and used almond milk.  It was very tasty!  The fruit it nice and tender, and the whole thing is done perfect in 35 mins.  I don't like it more or less than regular oatmeal, it's just a different way to eat it!  I don't eat mine with milk or anything, just straight as it is from the pan.  The fresh fruit makes it moist enough.

This was pretty good as written. Next time I will add more spices such as nutmeg and cloves, and a LOT more cinnamon. This worked well in an 8x8 square pan. I only refrigerated only for about 3 hours. I changed all the white sugar to brown sugar, and next time I will decrease the amount by about half.

Delicious!  Used Pumpkin Pie Spice instead of cinnamon and it was devoured.

My family loves this recipe, and every time I make it I change it up. The best was when I doubled the recipe and added 1/2 C. pumpkin purée,  chopped walnuts and 2 scoops of natural vegan protein powder to the mix.

Our families favorite oatmeal.  Loved it as the recipe is but the next time substituted blueberries for the raisins and brown sugar for the white sugar.  Delicious - was like a cross between a blueberry muffin and granola.  I will make this again and again and again.  Great for company too!

5 stars.  I've made other baked oatmeal and this one is the best.  I did not think it was too sweet...just sweet enough for us.  I did use 1/2 cup of applesauce instead of the oil.

Oh yummy yum! This was so so good! I used butter instead of oil and based on another review, cut the baking powder back to 2 tsp. I also added vanilla extract (1 tsp) and 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts. It's been hard for me not to go back and eat another piece! It tastes like a tender oatmeal cake that's not too sweet. This is a definite eat in the car on the way to work keeper.

I made this for Mother's Day and it was a huge success.  I split the sugar in half and added more brown sugar.  I will definitely make this again.

Not bad...mine was kind of dry.  I'm wondering if it would be different if I let it sit overnight (I cooked it right away - we were in a hurry).  I'll try it again for sure.

This was great, I loved oatmeal to begin with..but now I love it even more. The brown sugar is perfect on top for a slight crunch, and texture is great, goes wonderful with milk. I love this recipe and I am so glad I found it, I will def make again and again! Thank you

Definitely a keeper!  I love oatmeal but have gotten bored with a sloppy bowl of the stuff and was looking for something different.  THIS is it! I made some changes to try to make it a bit healthier and chose to not let it sit overnight (couldn't wait to try this), so it came out a bit dry and crumbly. Still, with a few more adjustments I know this will be incredible. I'm also planning on different fruits IE: apples, peaches, berries...  Mmm-mm!!

Delicious. I wish I hadn't just looked at the calorie content, though. Hahaha.  Craving baked oatmeal at 7 months pregnant- I COULD not refrigerate overnight; it still worked just fine.  Thanks a lot!

Very good.  I used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/4 cut of brown sugar with no sugar on the top.  Next time I would use less sugar in total.

So easy for busy mornings.  And my whole family loved it (which, let me tell you, is rare)!  It was great served with milk and tasted like a cross between a soft cold cereal and coffee cake.  A keeper!

I used a whole 7 grain cereal mix rather than quick oats and I substituted applesauce for a little more than 1/2 of the oil, plus I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  It could have been a little more moist, but was still outstanding, especially topped with skim milk.  Next time, I'll add some more liquid.

Cut back on the sugar and added some vanilla. Also added cinnamon to the batter. 

Doubled recipe. Did not make crumb topping and used applesauce/butter for the oil. Added peaches to half and raisins to the half. Got rave reviews at our runners' breakfast! Will freeze leftovers in squares for quick breakfasts this winter.

Edible but very average. I was really shocked this wasn't better tasting! It smelled so fantastic while baking and looked delicious. Sadly, it tasted very plain and bland. Texture was a little weird too. I'd recommend adding lots more spices and maybe apples if you want a flavoful meal!

I made this with 4C of oatmeal and 3 eggs.  To this I added 2 diced peeled chopped apples.  I did not add the sugar I added splenda/equal to eliminate the sugar but keep the sweet taste!!

Pretty good!  My husband hates oatmeal so I got him to try this recipe and he actually really likes it!  I made a few changes: 1/2 c brown sugar, 1/4 c white sugar, added 2 tsp cinnamon to the batter, and I substituted applesauce for the oil. Turned out great!  Will make again.

I did not let this refrigerate overnight.  I will try next time.  Also I used jarred applesauce in place of oil.  I added two chopped apples and some chopped walnuts as well.  I also used vanilla milk in place of regular milk and added a small peice of cinnamon stick and removed it after baking.  When this is finished my family adds tropical fruit and cream to the top (more of a desert for us).  It is delicious this way!

The texture was a little dry, but I made a half recipe and perhaps cooked a little too long.

this was a nice change from traditional oatmeal.  it's great when you have guests or a busy day planned because of the night-before prepping.  i added more than twice the recommended amount of raisins, and thought it could still use some more (love the raisins!)

This is a great recipe. I have made it many times over the last year for an easy make-ahead Sunday morning breakfast or to take to brunches. The only change I made to the recipe is to add 1/2 cup blueberries in place of the raisins and then served it with a blueberry sauce I found on this site submitted my Isybel. The combination is SO yummy!

We liked this recipe slightly better than baked oatmeal II.  I served this with half and half, applesauce, and leftover raspberry orange soup as available toppings.  Great breakfast!

This recipe is a delicious desert/snack.
Whenever I feel peckish I now take a bit of Baked oatmeal.
The great thing about it is that it is very healthy.
Excellent all round!

I have 5 children that loved this oatmeal. I don't usually like oatmeal but I thought this was great. The only thing I will change next time is use applesauce and add apples. Also I will have to make more, because all my kids wanted seconds.

This was edible. I amnot sure what I expected, but this was certainly not it.

Great recipe.  I followed some of the advice of some other reviews and incorporated the following changes.  I used 1/4 cup each of brown sugar and white sugar.  I also used dried cranberries instead of raisins.  This is a keeper.

Excellent, easy alternative to standard oatmeal.
I substituted oil for applesauce and splenda for sugar and used old fashioned oats. Also added cranberries instead of raisins per other's suggestions and it came out perfect. We will definatley make again.

This is SO good!  A friend brought it to a church brunch, and there were at least 6 of us who wanted the recipe.  She told us about allrecipes.com.  What a great breakfast to prepare the night before!

I make this for our school faculty breakfasts, as well as for Christmas morning - and everyone asks for the recipe.  It is delicious!

This was OK.  It was a little too dry for me. You could serve w/ milk or cream, but that is somewhat of a hassle if you are serving brunch/breakfast buffet-style.

Fantastic.  Next time I will follow other reviewers suggestions and make with applesauce instead of oil and I'll likely add nuts.

This recipe is good.  It has a strong taste of baking powder so I will lighten up on the baking powder next time.

I served this as a dessert after dinner and it was good, but I think it's best left as a breakfast meal.  A dollop of whipped cream would probably be good.  I used half white and half brown sugar for the white sugar portion.  Baked up nicely and was moist but kind of crumbly.  Would make an excellent item for a buffet for a large group.

This has a little bit too much sugar in it but other than that it was really good.  A nice change from traditional oatmeal cereal and something my children love to eat.
