We liked this very much, even the husband, who isn't very fond of vegetables in general and NEW ways of serving vegetables in particular. (He actually could not I.D. the blueberries at first--he was pushing them off to the side until I asked him about it--thought they were black olives!). I did make a few changes based on necessity. *Resized the recipe to 10 so that I could use up 1 entire bag of romaine (which if you're curious, yields 8 cups of lettuce if you dont squish it down). *Used dried mixed berries instead of just dried cranberries. *Used less blueberries than called for and extra dried berries--this was a choice based on price, because I used fresh. I think I COULD have bought frozen blueberries, thawed & drained them though, because I don't really care if they stain my salad blue. *Used all low-fat feta & no goat cheese. None of the above changes make any real difference overall. Except maybe the feta or sunflower seeds--you need one or both of those to cut the sweetness. The real changes I made were in the dressing. *Used RED balsamic vinegar instead of WHITE because it's what I had. *Used pancake syrup instead of real maple because it's what I had. *Used olive oil instead of grapeseed oil because I couldn't find it at the grocery store. ~It was still tasty even with these substitutions. I mixed my dressing separately from my salad because the salad gets re-bagged and eaten all week and you can't do that with dressing all over it.

I have made this a few times now, but forgot to review. A couple of times I did not have the goat cheese or Feta and I made anyway. I used Monterey Jack instead. Was still excellent! Thank you, Monica, for a fresh, unique,and light salad that pairs well with almost any meat and vegetables or as a terrific lunch. Pretty presentation too, for company, if you get plenty of the dark green Romaine too, in it.

This recipe is fantastic.  The only changes I made, and they didn't really alter the recipe, were that I used raspberries instead of blueberries b/c I don't really care for blueberries, and I didn't use goat cheese but I did use the feta.  Oh, and I used pecans instead of walnuts.  I did follow the dressing recipe exactly.  I really do think the grapeseed oil makes a difference, if you can find it.  It's not as strong of a flavor as olive oil.  And use real maple syrup if you can too.  I'm sure it would still be good with substitutions but definitely best if you follow the recipe.

Loved it! Used regular balsamic (had it), pancake syrup (had it), olive oil (you guessed it) & dressing was fantastic!  Only thing I might do next time that would improve an already faultless salad might be to lightly toast the nuts.

Yummmy!! A crowd favorite at the bbq, so easy and quick.  I used all ingredients, except traded pecans for walnuts.  The dressing is simple but fantastic, try it the way it's listed.  I bought extra ingredients, and made it a second day, added chopped cooked chicken breast, and had a wonderful salad for dinner.

This dressing curdled in the fridge after around a week.  It was horribly disappointing, especially considering the price of maple syrup.  Make it in small quantities so it isn't in the fridge for more than a day.  Or, skip the feta and use a drizzle of lemon juice as your only dressing.

The salad combination is quite good.  The dressing seems too sweet.  Perhaps if the maple syrup were halved and some of the balsamic switched out for white vinegar I would like it better.

A fantastic combination of ingredients! I loved getting a bite with both the chewy cranberries and crunchy sunflower nuts. I used canola oil instead of grapeseed, but I wish I had used EVOO. I left out the goat cheese since I didn't have any. To help emulsify the dressing, I added a tsp. mayo and a tsp. dijon. Some fresh cracked pepper was also a nice addition to the dressing.

This was sensational! I didn't have any sunflower seeds. I used olive oil instead of grapeseed. This was sweet but not overly so as the balsamic vinegar balances it out. My husband wouldn't even try it, he said, "it smells like vinegar". I loved this salad. Thanks, this was simply divine.

Wow.. sooo good my husband ate seconds on salad!..  I used raspberres instead of blueberries.  My favorite part was the dried sweet cranberries and nuts.  I didn't care for the goat cheese, but will try another one next time.  I will make this again!.. Thanks!

A very different and interesting salad, no one guessed there was maple syrup in it. I combined all the dressing ingredients together before adding to the salad and ended up with some dressing left over for a fresh salad for lunch the next day. Would definitely make again.

This is a really wonderful salad!  A great way to get kids to eat lettuce.  I made the following substitutions (using what I had): almond slices instead of walnuts, feta cheese doubled omitting the goat cheese, red instead of white balsamic vinegar, and canola oil instead of grapeseed.  I didn't have sunflower seeds either, but I think that it was still fine because of the almonds.  The dressing was awesome.  I recommend mixing the dressing together first before pouring on the salad because you might find that you don't need the full amount.

Great recipe, but we found that the dressing was very "wet" on 3 romaine hearts!!! Next time I will scale the dressing down, and double up on both cheeses.  I also added a sprinkling of cayenne pepper for some heat with the sweet.  A really wonderful salad!  Thank you for sharing!

A great salad, great combination of flavors!!!  I have made this exactly to recipe and it's 5 stars, I've made this by cutting down by 1/2 on the maple syrup and vinegar and still 5 stars!  Hats off to Monica for a refreshing, delightful salad!

This salad is amazing.  What makes it 5 stars is the dressing.  I had to use olive oil because I didn't have grapeseed, but I don't think it detracted from it at all.  The proportions are just right.  And it works so well with the fruit and the tartness of the cheeses.  This is definitely on the sweet side, but that's the way I like salads and dressings.

Excellent salad! I made this for my mother's birthday and even my picky grandma raved about it. I found there was too much dressing when I tossed it. You could either cut down the dressing (ratio is 3:3:3), or add more lettuce (I reccommend more lettuce... that means more salad ;) ). This is an excellent and versatile recipe. Try it!!!!

There was nothing spectacular about this recipe.  We had a maple themed potluck at my work and I chose this recipe.  Salad ingredients were fine--they dressing was fine, but I probably wouldn't make it again.

This was a wonderful dressing. The mix of nuts, seeds and berries along with the dried cranberries is perfect.   I used red leaf lettuce mixed with iceburg.  The goat cheese I spluged for was  not what I wanted.  It  was like a brie but the cheese was so soft inside it was runny so that was dissapointing.  I managed to cut some up and dump it in the salad along with the feta.

This was awesome!  I made some substitutions based upon what I had in the house.  I used raspberries instead of blueberries, bleu cheese instead of feta and goat cheese and olive oil in place of the grapeseed oil.  Delicious-I will definitely make this one again!

I made this salad using sugar-free maple syrup in the dressing since I am diabetic. It was fabulous! I love the sweet-sour tanginess of the dressing. I am planning to make this again for a bridal shower brunch. I'm sure it will be a hit! Thanks!

Fabulous!  Easy and so refreshing.  I think I may add some cucumbers and bacon next time.  Even grilled chicken breast would taste great with the dressing.

I made this for a dinner party, and people could not stop telling me how delicious it was! For personal preference, I used almonds instead of walnuts, and used all feta cheese instead of a feta/goat cheese combination. I also added grape tomatoes and cut the oil slightly to 3 Tbsp, to make it slightly healthier. The dressing still tasted delicious, and was enough to cover two bags of romaine lettuce. Amazing - a real keeper!

Thanks for the recipe Monica! A friend brought this to a dinner party and gave me your recipe. I have it for lunch often now. I like that it's easy to make as well as tasty.

We loved this salad!  It is now officially on my "please bring salad" list!  Honestly, the salad is pefect as is... I did go with toasted pumpkin seeds rather than the walnuts (I keep a batch of toasted pumpkin seeds on hand so that they are available for just the two of us... just a thought....

So good.  Made a few minor changes and it was a huge hit.  First, I decreased the maple syrup.  Not even by half, but I was worried it would be too sweet for my crowd and I was right.  I also feel like the feta was unnecessary.  It was good with it, but if you don't have it, don't worry.  I also made sure the pumpkin seeds were toasted and salted to also cut sweetness.  I mixed all the ingredients for the dressing together with a good amount of salt & pepper in a mason jar and shook because I was transporting and I didn't want to dress too early.   I also used half canola oil/half olive oil and dark balsamic because I had it and I thought it was perfect.  Thanks, it was amazing.

Used maple syrup asthat was what I had and the salad got rave reviews from our two guests.  Added a bit more cheese as we love goat and  feta.  Will definitely make again.

I didn't add the full amount of oil and could cut back on the syrup a bit as well.  Plenty of dressing and depending on the quality of your maple syrup, less might be better.  This one is a certain keeper though.

Love this salad.  The only changes I made were  to use feta cheese because I did not have goat cheese and to use olive oil rather than grape seed oil.

My husband and I liked this salad very much.  I especially liked how quick, easy and adaptable the recipe is.  I followed the recipe loosely, omitting the feta because we didn't have any on hand.  I usually toast seeds and nuts for salads, but didn't this time; I didn't feel the salad suffered from the change and not toasting the nuts saved me a few minutes in preparation.  I added some roasted chicken breast cut into cubes.  This addition was a good balance for the sweet dressing.  Also, the dressing  was sweet for my taste so I used it very sparingly.  I have dressing left over so guess I'll need to make the salad again tomorrow.  ; )

This was okay but I found the dressing to be overpoweringly maple flavored. I made everything as the recipe stated but without the goat cheese (which I did not have on hand).  The romaine with berries, nuts & feta was great. The dressing not so much. Might make again with a sweet & sour dressing.

I have made this salad many times over the past year or so. Every time, someone asks for the recipe. I never change anything except that the sunflower seeds do come salted and toasted. It's a perfect salad for a main dish or a side. Someone said her dressing curdled when refrigerated. Not mine, and I've kept it in the fridge for days.

Decided to give this a try based on all the great reviews, didn't expect all those ingredients would mix and taste so good together! 
It's the fourth time we make already!
Switched it up with blackberries and pecans once, also tasted really good.
But the original recipe given is the best.
Must try!

BEST SALAD RECIPE!  Everyone loves this salad.   The Maple syrup in the dressing is what make this salad special.  Don't skip this part and use some other dressing.  Also if you don't have goat cheese just add extra fea..

Always a hit at family gatherings, and looks fantastic with all the colors.  Made exactly as written, only exception was no goat cheese, only feta.  I have made this 3 or 4 times, and will continue to!

Used all goat's cheese, marion berries (instead of blueberries) and iceberg lettuce with fabulous results.  This is a keeper.
