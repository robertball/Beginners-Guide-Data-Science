WOW! Really good. Southern Comfort is somewhat a fruity tasting spiced liqueur and the combination of it with the richness and depth of the apple cider compliment each other perfectly. The amount called for too is perfect for 1 drink on the rocks (1/2 c. liquid).  Be careful, these go down easy. My new Autumn favorite!

I used honey flavored whiskey. Probably a good thing I only had enough for 2 drinks.

This was delicious and was a big hit at our Thanksgiving celebration. I did feel like it was a bit strong for the tastes in my crowd so I did 3/4 cup Southern Comfort to 2 cups cider, then left the bottle of So. Co. out for anyone who felt they needed more.

My goodness this is good. I used one of those packets of apple cider since I didn't have any real cider on hand. This is perfect.
