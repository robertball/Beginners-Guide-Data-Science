This is an excellent recipe! Some suggestions for people who say the batter is thin and the edges are crispy. First, when you make crepes, you have to tilt the hot, slightly greasy pan and pour the batter in the from the edges. DO NOT start in the center or else you will end up with "the batter would settle to the center before setting" as stated in an earlier comment. Secondly, immediately after you cook them, place them in a tupperware with the lid covering them, but NOT sealed. This will keep them warm and moisten the edges and other crispy areas. This is the perfect crepe recipe! The taste and consistency are on point. So any complaints people have about this recipe is not because of the batter, it's because of not cooking them correctly. These are great and truly easy to make!

I made this last night and I did not have a problem with the batter, I did however add about 3 TABLESPOONS of sugar and 1 tsp of vanilla to to mix because I like mine sweet. Also I am a bit of a cheater on rolling the batter in the pan, I use a 12 inch non stick skillet with taller sides so that I get a perfectly round crepe every time and they don't get crispy this way if you put just enough batter to coat the pan then the whole things cooks evenly and you really don't have a need to flip the crepe. Mine came out pale and thin, I did not find that the sugar at all contrubuted to any kind of browning of the crepes as others mentioned, perhaps they are using a pan that is too hot, I cook mine on medium low heat and never have a problem.

Although this is not the simpliest of recipes, it definately the best so far. I served it to my wife without anything topping on it all, and she loved it. That was the proof that I was looking for in a good crepe. I believe the added eggs and the use of butter makes all the differnce. Be sure to follow the instructions and your will not be disappointed.

This is basically the same recipe I've been using since my French grandma taught me to make crepes years ago. It's all about the ratios - 1:2 flour to milk, eggs to bind, butter to lube it up, sugar and salt to taste.   If you're getting a bad result with this recipe, the problem is probably your heat settings. Too high, and you get dried curlies on the edges. Too low, and you get that thick-in-the-middle effect as the batter settles to the lowest point in the pan before it has a chance to set up. Don't just set the heat and let it go; keep adjusting as you cook and you'll find the balance point.   Also, let the crepe tell you when it's time to turn - you'll know because when you shake the pan, it will move freely. Then give it another 15-30 seconds and go for it. There should be enough butter hanging out in the batter to make buttering a non-stick pan unnecessary if your heat is right.   Making crepes is a very "feel" based endeavor, but this is an excellent recipe for people who didn't have the benefit of having a little old French lady in the house growing up. Thanks for posting! :)

Very Good recipe I am keeping this one in place of the basic crepe recipes from this site. I let the batter sit in the fridge for 20 min to hour... you will have a more tender crepe.. also I used a 12 inch skillet and 1/2 cup of batter and they were perfect.

These are the first crepes I ever made, and they were delicious! They did get a little crispy on the edges, but I liked the added texture.  I stuff them with scrambled eggs and some veggies and cheese, and top lightly with hollandaise sauce. Very hearty breakfast. Also cook them up early, they keep very well in the frig!

Not the best.  Batter is too thin.  It was more difficult to get the batter to roll properly across the pan and resulted in crepes with cripsy edges, as the batter would settle to the center before setting.  I even tried allowing the batter to remain in the refrigerator over night to allow the gluten to develop... still not successful.  Also, 1t. sugar does not lend a noticable sweet flavor to the crepe, it only lends to premature browning.  Crepes should be pale, thin, tender, with a smooth even surface.  I'll just have to look harder for my old recipe.

This is a very good basic crepes recipe. I scale it down to 4 servings (the smallest you can get without splitting an egg) and it makes the perfect amount for out family. Barely any ingredients needed. Everyone's favorite filling is apples: I melt butter and brown sugar together and add sliced apples, raisins, cinnimon, and nutmeg. So good with the crepes!!

I am French and really like this recipe. I add vanilla extract and some lemon or orange zest just like my mom used to do when I was a child. Also, to get rid of the lumps I pour the batter in a blender and voila!!
excellent with nutella

We ususally have crepes every Christmas morning. That's our tradition. But since living here in Europe, we eat crepes more often than once per year because they're found everywhere! Plus we're only 30 minutes from France so crepes are easily accessible. Well, I wanted to get that same taste at home so I searched for a crepe recipe and low and behold, this is the one that tastes most like authentic French crepes than any other recipe I've tried before and my kids LOVE it! It's super easy and super delicious! I highly recommend it!

As my husband said, "A+!!"  He absolutely loves crepes.  I have to agree, these were great.  For those having issues with crispy edges, try a bit cooler stove top temperature.  I spoon the batter in the pan, as I hold it, and immediately roll the pan.  Don't walk away too far, or they will over cook.  I have fun flipping the crepes one handed.  I made a filling made from a 16 oz tub of frozen sweetened strawberries and cream cheese.  I drain the juice from the strawberries and add half a stick of cream cheese and blend it in my mini chopper.  After its done, I add the remaining strawberries, and sit aside until the crepes are done.  Absolutely perfect, thank you.

Even with whole wheat flour, these French breakfast delights turn out like a culinary masterpiece. We love them in the summer with lemon yogurt, a mixture of local fruits, a sprinkle of crunchy granola, and a hint of cinnamon or powdered sugar.

Really good crepes. I
Doubled the recipe for a huge batch and added 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract. I made them with hazelnut
Chocolate spread and slightly sweetened whipped cream with folded in mashed banana. YUM! I did take some pointers from reviews to make this one of which was not
To pour
The batter
Onto the pan like a pancake and central but rather to start pouring from one side of the pan tilted moving your
Hand from side to side
So it spreads wide rather than in a thin strip, so it spreads across the pan wide and thin. It's kind of like spreading a
Thin layer of whipped egg if you wanted to make an egg
Sheet across your pan. I think pouring snd spreading technique makes all the difference in what your result will be as far as size and thickness. Then for a
Thicker crepe after spreading it across
The pan I made it not tilted anymore lay the pan flat
And pour a little more batter in the center to
Make it thicker. Also I did not use the suggested amount of batter per crepe. I wanted to make large nearly plate sized ones
Like burrito wrap size so I used about half a cup of batter per crepe spreading it wide and thin across from one
Side of the pan to the other in a back and
Forth motion. They turned out great
And got gobbled up faster
Than I could make them! Hehe :)

Always let crepe batter rest for an hour or so before cooking. This is the highest ratio of liquid-to-flour I've seen in a crepe recipe, but there are also more eggs in this one, which I suppose keeps it from being too delicate to handle.

Oh my goodness!!! Amazing crepes. Tastes like Paris. :) Easy to make and so delicious; I literally ate them as they came out of the pan. Cinnamon and sugar make a great, simple filling, or lemon and honey...or my personal favorite, Nutella. The best thing about these crepes, however, is how good they are without anything at all! I will for sure make these again.

This was a pretty good crepe, it tasted similar to what I had in Paris. They came out golden brown, with a light texture.  The only problem with them is they were way too greesy. I made the recipe just like it says.  The milk I used was 2%. Next time I make these I will add 1 tbsp to the batter.
As for the color of the crepe, a real french crepe SHOULD be golden brown. When I was in paris, all the crepes that I had were golden brown and took a long time to cook.
For my filling, cook your crepe on both sides until golden brown then add your fillings. I used 1 lightly beaten egg and spread it around added salt and pepper, maybe a large tablespoon cheese, and thinly sliced ham.  I folded it over to enclose the filling, so they would cook. Then folded them over again to make a triangle. This took about 5 min to complete 1 crepe. Even though the crepe looks like it will be crispy it won't be and you will have a more authentic French crepe.
I used a 12 inch non-stick pan and used about 1/2 cup batter. I used between a med low heat and med.

First time ever making crepes and they were perfect! Even the very first one out of the pan! I followed the advice of others and poured the batter around the outer edge of a hot buttered pan which worked wonderfully. Mmmm. These are our family's new Sunday brunch favorite! We did half savory with chive cream cheese and bacon filling and half sweet with plain cream cheese (mixed with a spoonful of powdered sugar) topped with cherry compote. Delicious!

Great tasting crepes! I followed what others said about putting a few drops of vanilla essence into the mixture and it turned out fabulous! Easy to handle, and you have to work very fast with this mixture because its a bit runny; but the easier to spread it out on the griddle :) My non-stick pan was a bit big, so I used a laddle ( small sized) and pour it on top, give it a nice wiggle to get the mixture evenly spread. Remember to remove your pan from the heat when doing this because the mixture gets cook pretty fast. I ate it with whipped cream & bananas. YUMMM! Thanks for the recipe :)

Super Easy and yummy!!! After two and a half years of being afraid to try to make crepes at home, I now am in disbelief at how easy it is! My mom gave us a crepe maker and we tried it, it was the worst thing ever. So frustrating. I cant beleive how easy it is to make crepes with a regular frying pan. I followed the recipe exactly and they taste just like the ones I have eatten in Paris. The way I made mine was to use a punch bowl spoon and poured it in the middle of the pan and quickly swirled the liquid around the pan (using the bottom of the spoon.) I filled mine with nutella, choped pecans, bananas, and whiped cream. Another time I chopped a green apple into about 12-16 slices and cooked them with butter, brown sugar and cinnamon until soft. Do try this recipe!!!

We love having crepes for breakfast on a lazy Saturday, and always use the same recipe. I decided to try this one out this morning for a change of pace. The crepes were entirely too thin and extremely soggy. They also burnt extremely easily. I definitely don't recommend this recipe. Their taste and texture isn't right.

Perfect!  I served with a sauce made of low-sugar raspberry jam and a splash of orange juice.  I made two different kinds of filling:  chocolate pudding, and a mixture of cottage cheese, vanilla, and cinnamon.  If you don't have chocolate pudding, I highly recommend Nutella.

Ok, I'll be honest -I haven't really tried this recipe but I'm giving them a good review because they seem to be very close to crepes as I like them :)The only thing that's missing from the ingredients is some kind of flavoring: orange blossom extract, vanilla, rhum or even beer... With a little kick they taste so much better and are much lighter too :)

I grew up on crepes and my mother still makes them every weekend for my father and nephew. I was looking for a recipe to make for my boyfriend - who is from Germany and also grew up on crepes - and tried this one. My boyfriend was thrilled and said they tasted exactly like they should. I'm making them again this morning.

Compared to other crepe recipes I looked over this one was lowest in carbs, which is important to someone cooking for a diabetic. We made no changes to the recipe and they were tasty without any filling, but we did fill them with a dusting of powdered sugar and fresh berries.

I was making the basic recipe for a little while. This one blows it out of the kitchen! It really is the perfect crepe recipe, it's all in how you cook it. If you don't have a crepe pan or a griddle then you have to be careful of the edges of the pan, that's what makes it crispy. It's all in the way you drop the batter and the temp of the pan. Don't be overly careful, they turn out much better if you have a bit of fun with it!

Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. I was skeptical about the use of 3 eggs, but I made it exactly according to the directions and they were perfect. The best crepes I have ever made thin, crisp and a real treat. I used a bit of oil in the frying pan as well in order to get them nice and crisp.

This is one of the easiest recipes for crepes that I have tried and it is just as delicious as the others.  The key, truly, is in the pan and being able to spread the batter evenly so the crepe is all ready to be flipped at the same time.  I use a flat frosting blade to turn crepes, if you are looking around your kitchen for the right kind of tool to turn them over. A spatula never works when I try.

Consider using sprinkled granulated sugar and lemon juice for the filling.  Roll up, and yummy.  We found a walnut-fig preserve at Whole Foods that was delicious in crepes, with whipped cream on top.  Also wonderful stuffed with shrimp in a cheese / bechemel sauce with peas, carrots and onion.

Perfect crepe recipe! I have tried many different ones and even premade mixes but I always come back to this one. I am not good at making them but another reviewers suggestion to cook over medium low and pour in the side of your pan and tilt around is how I get the best results.  I follow the recipe exactly and triple it because my 4 boys eat them up so fast!

I just made these for my family this morning (served with fruit and sweetened cream.  They are how I remember crepes from the time I lived in France.  My original recipe is for a huge crowd; so, I loved getting a paired down version.  In France, ours were served at dinner with a cheese sauce in one crepe and either creamed spinach or creamed Swiss chard in the other.

YUM!!  These were great! We ate them for dinner (yes you heard me correctly) on Fat Tuesday, instead of pancakes. I filled them with three berries and vanilla ice-cream. My only suggestion is to make sure you don't try and flip them too soon or else they will fall apart. Watch them until you see bubbles appear on top, and try to loosen the edges. If it loosens and you see the bubbles, they are probably ready for flipping. I let them cook longer on the first side than on the second. 

Enjoy these!  Thanks for the great recipe!

My father used to make these for everyone for Easter breakfast (about 40 family members) and sadly he passed away unexpectedly without ever sharing the recipe with any of our family.  I was chosen to be the be the chef for this year and picked this recipe because it looked very similar to what I remembered him putting in the bowl.

Excellent recipe that didn't disappoint.  He would have been proud of me.  I only added some maple syrup flavoring or vanilla in my batches.  Everyone loved them.  I also coated the pan with a light coating of crisco & a little pat of butter (for flavoring).  The edges came out crispy and delicious!

Was a little thin, so I added 2 tablespoons more of flour. I also added a drop of pure vanilla extract. Made it soo wonderful. I pureed strawberries and put inside the crepes with slices of strawberries. Then I put some powdered sugar and whipped cream on top. Yum!!!!

Good recipe, easy to make and something I would make again.  However, I did add an additional tablespoon of sugar, as my son didn't think they were sweet enough, he eats them plain.  I also found cooking them on a med-low setting will keep the edges from getting crispy.

This could be a good recipe, but as some reviewers have noted already, the proportions are wrong. It should be (1) cup of milk not (2). I made some sugar substitutes and it was perfect. I put 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 cup of whey, and a tablespoon of maple syrup and vanilla into the milk and egg liquids. You can thin this out with a little milk, but it doesn't need a whole 2 cups. We put in fresh compote and requeson; peanut butter n dark chocolate; swiss cheese, tomato n ham in another. If you don't want sweet crepes just put in 1/4 cup or less of sugar and they balance great with salty innards. Blessed kitchens.

This was my first time making crepes and I love this recipe! Although I did add a Tbs of sugar instead and two Tbs of brown sugar with a splash of vanilla, this recipe was good. I paired it off with a sour cream and brown sugar crepe filling. This dish was to die for! Kudos

These are so good. I put a mixture of cranberry chutney and cream cheese in it, and it was great. Nutella and bananas inside the crepe topped with powder sugar is also good.

After reading other reviews I decided to add a little bit of vanilla to the recipe - it was fabulous, however getting the batter to evenly spread across the pan can be difficult. - while I lived in Paris I ate crepe every day, and always watched them make it, they would pour the batter on and in one smooth motion spread it over the pan using a crepe spreader, but they still taste delicious without one they just aren't as pretty.

Delicious and easy! We love putting fresh fruit in them for breakfast, or making a protein filled scrambled egg and ham mixture for dinner....simply sprinkling sugar on one is a treat as well :) Will make again and again

This recipe was excellent! The batter came together very well. I made a few modifications (added a splash of vanilla and stuck the batter in the fridge over night just in case it would be too thin), but the essentials of the recipe were there and they made for some delicious crepes! My only nit-picky complaint was that two tablespoons of batter did not yield full sized crepes, but then my pan may have caused the size problems. 5/5

These were delicious! They took almost no time to make, and we got a lot of crepes out of the recipe. I did acidentally put in 2 tablespoons of butter instead of 2 teaspoons but it tasted fine. The one things that didn't work was that they were hard to make very thin, and they ended up being kind of lumpy.

I'm sorry I found this recipe. . . because now I'm going to be making and eating these all the time!  First time I've ever made crepes and I didn't have any problems with this batter. I had to throw the first crepe out because the pan was too hot and the crepe tore apart when I tried to flip it.  I turned down the heat to medium and didn't have any problems after that. Strawberry, banana & nutella. . .oh my!

Excellent recipe. I did up the sugar since I was making a dessert crepe (see photo with strawberries and mangoes). Also, I made other small substitutions because of what I had on hand: imitation butter extract, vanilla extract, and soy milk instead of real milk.  The technique for crepes is difficult, but using my griddle and deep non-stick spoon, I was able to spread out the batter as I was pouring it, and before it set too much. They came out pretty consistent in thickness and tasted fantastic!

These tasted good, but were much more difficult to work with than other recipes from this site. I just about pulled my hair out by the time I finished making 2 batches of these. I ended up adding about 1/2 cup of flour - they were just SO fragile that I couldn't even flip them. And I make crepes at least weekly, so it wasn't for lack of experience. I'd stick with one of the more simple 4 ingredient recipes on this site.

I just recently had some wonderful crepes at an art festival.  It made me realize that the recipe I had been using wasn't great, so I went looking for a better one.  Boy did I find it.  These crepes turned out exactly like the ones from the crepe stand.  I think the butter in the batter makes a huge difference. I will say that when I poured my first one I was surprised at how thin the batter was -thinner than my old recipe.  However, once it cooks it really is perfect if a little difficult to flip.  Here are my recommendations.  I use a plug in electric frying pan to make these (also do pancakes this way).  That means my husband and I can sit at the table together and I'm not stuck standing over the stove.  I found that two scoops from my small ladle filled the complete bottom of the electric fry pan.  I thought that the batter may have been too deep, but it was perfect.  Cook and watch for the edges to crisp and pull away from the pan.  Flip and cook for 15-30 seconds on the other side.  Flip back and fill.  Then fold in half diagonally and in half again for a triangular shaped crepe.  Delicious even if it is unusually large.  For filling my favorite is butter with cinnamon and sugar.   That really shows off the flavor of the crepe.  Also good with nutella and banana (hubby's favorite), jam or butter, sugar and fresh squeezed lemon to cleanse the palette.    I mixed up the batter in the blender and it worked great.  My husband and I ate them all up!  Yum  This is a keeper.

I was skeptical about the batter being too thin (as other reviewers mention) but I went ahead and followed the recipe to a T and they turned out perfect!  The only word that would describe these is "lace".  I will definitely be making these again.

This is one of the best crepe recipes I have ever tried. I doubled the recipe up which produced a lot of crepes! I also used half whole wheat flour and half regular flour to make them a bit more nutritious. I have to admit I was a little nervous to see how they would turn out but they were fantastic. Definitely one of my favourite breakfast recipes!

I made these crepes today and you can eat them hot or cold. I heat them for breakfast and put preserves on them or some times cinnamon & sugar. or for dessert put a pudding or mousse dress them up with fruit. This time I put a strawberry Instant Pudding in them with fresh strawberries. Will be making these again. Thanks, Happy Cooking!

Does it make a difference what kind of frying pan you use? I have a Scanpan (ceramic nonstick), and my crepes didn't really "brown" at all. They were pale and thick. They were delicious, but they didn't like like the picture. Any recommendations? I didn't have to use butter or oil since they just slid right off the pan. Would this make a difference?

Best Crepe recipe I've made so far.  I also increased the sugar, like other reviewers, after tasting the first one that cooked.  I cooked them slowly on my electric range, on setting 3.5 out of 10.  They took a long time to cook but they came out great.  I covered them and the edges softened from the condensation.  They keep fine in the fridge for a few days.  Just heat them up when you want to use them.

These are absolutely delightful! I would suggest making sure you pour the batter from the outside in to get the best thickness. I noticed one side is oily and the other is not. I am guessing because the butter rises when the initial side cooks then is on the bottom when you flip them. Any thoughts? I might try skipping the butter next time.

Batter is too thin. I was looking for a recipe similar to my grandmothers and mothers from Poland, seeing as how I am unable to contact either one currently. This batter is much too thin even after adding more flour. And sugar is not needed in crepe recipes.

this recipes is great. The tip about pouring the batter from the edges to the center really helped a lot. try adding some vanilla and lemon zest for even more flavor.

Great recipe.  I cut them into strips like noodles, put chocolate pudding on top and whipped cream.  Very good.

It turned out very well. 2 tablespoons butter makes it too greasy. 1 tablespoon works perfectly.

Excellent recipe and easy to follow. Used a little more salt and added an egg. I used a lightly oiled cast iron pan and made some really nice & thin crepes! Don't be discouraged by any difficulties you may have with the first crepe...that's the time to adjust temp and get a good feel for how much batter you'll require to make the size crepe you want.

I have never made crepes before so I was a little reluctant.  But, these were easy and very delicious. I cut the recipe in half and it would really only serve 3 or 4 people I believe.  I filled them with blueberries and vanilla yogurt.  Would not change a thing.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

Perfect crepes! Beating the mixture and using ample butter in the pan is key! Reminds me of when my Oma used to make them growing up! DELISH!

This is a really good base crepe recipe to use for all sorts of fillings, not to mention easy easy easy.  I made a batch of these and got about a dozen crepes out of it which was great.  I will keep this recipe for future use.

They came out perfect! I used a half of a ladle for each crepe, poured it into the side of the pan and tilted it. For those who like theirs crisp, I used a lid. I also tipped it onto a plate then put it back in the pan to brown the opposite side. Personally I like mine golden. It's extremely important to put about 1/2 a tablespoon of butter on the pan for each crepe so they slid right out. I sprinkled cinnamon/sugar on some, put ricotta cheese and blueberries on others and rolled them up. Scrumptious! My ancestors wold be proud!

I thought that this recipe was just wonderful! What i did though was add a few drops of vanilla just to give it a more "cake" taste. Also, I stayed my heat around low and medium. I would like to say this was my first time making Crepes and ended up with 13 out of 15 just perfect. Thanks.

This recipe made a very water batter that was difficult to handle on the pan. The finished product didn't have the best flavour, there are better recipes out there.

Not bad.  This was my second time making crepes and this recipe turned out a lot better than my last attempt.  I did have some trouble getting the batter to roll out evenly in the pan but toward the end I was doing better so I'm guessing it was my inexperience that was the problem.  I cooked them for my grandparents and we topped them with homemade blackberry sauce.  They were a hit!

I agree with other reviewers that the proportions are messed up in this recipe!  We had to add about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of flour to make these edible.  They were WAY too thin.  I will stick with the Basic Crepe recipe from this site.

These came out just as in the photo :) ...despite my only having 1/2 cup of milk! Made up the rest of the liquid out of water I used to rinse the milk carton. I added 1 tsp vanilla as they were for a dessert. Will make again for sure.

My family loves this recipe!  My husband is Polish and craves "Nalesniki" the Polish version of French crepes.  This is the closest recipe I've found to it.    We eat our crepes with nutella, nutella and cocconut, raspberry syrup, or cheesecake filling.

This is the closest recipe I have found to authentic French crepes. For those who say that the batter is too thin, that is how French crepes are supposed to be! Almost paper thin and slightly crisp on the edges. In the states everyone makes them WAY too thick. Also, you MUST know how to cook crepes for them to turn out. My only complaint with this recipe is that some of the crepes did have edges that were a bit too crispy.

These turned out great. They were just like the ones my grandpa used to make for me when I was little. I made a berry sauce with blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, sugar, and lemon juice to put over the top of them. Couldn't have been better!

Great basic crepe recipe that can be used in savory or sweet desserts.  I had no issues with the batter, and I used 1/2 wheat and 1/2 white flour.

This is a great recipe! I have made it 4 times now and the last time I did something a bit different. I did add a tsp. of vanilla, simply because I love vanilla. I mixed it in a blender and refrigerated it for a while. It was a timing issue more than anything as far as the refrigeration goes, but the batter seemed to work better when it was cold for some reason. I do have an old crepe recipe that actually calls for refrigeration before use, so there may be something to it.  The rest stayed in the blender for the next day. Once quick spin to remix it and it was set to go. We made homemade whipping cream and used sliced strawberries and chocolate one day and par cooked sliced cinnamon apples and caramel sauce the next. I will omit the vanilla if I ever make dinner crepes.

This recipe is great, the crepes turned out perfect! The batter was nice and thin and easily spread out in the pan for a soft and delicious crepe. I filled them with (a) ham and grated gruyere and (b) soft goat cheese, honey and toasted pine nuts, along with a hint of freshly grated pepper. I have a little batter left over from this morning and will make some more for dessert tonight. Thanks for the recipe!

These crepes were great. I had been searching for a recipe that matched a recipe that my french teacher had given me in highschool. This was exactly the way that I remember them. I did add a little more sugar the second time I made them and they made a better dessert crepe that way. My husband loved them too.

Turned out awesome. They were gone in a few minutes. I tweaked the recipe a little. I cut the recipe in half but added two eggs, 1 tsp of sugar, 1 tsp of vanilla, and omitted the butter. Turned out perfect. I'm going to keep this recipe around.

My brother promised his teacher that his sister would make some French crepes for his French class at school and forget  to let me know until the day before. Luckily, I found this recipe and had all the ingredients on hand. They were very simple and came out great. My brother said there were absolutely no leftovers after his class party! I filled mine with some strawberries, delicious!

These tasted much like crepes. I don't think they were that special, but they were good. I've not had anything better, but I wasn't really impressed. served their purpose, pretty easy. (don't try 1/4 this recipe. It doesn't work so well)

I tried to make this recipe with out checking if I had milk.  I didn't have milk.  I did have silk (soy milk) so I tried it. and it worked great! I thinned it out a bit by adding a little extra water to make it easier to roll.
My nephues loved them.

My Great Grandmother came over from Germany with an amazing Crepe recipe and I could not find it anywhere.  I am so happy I found this, it is exactly like her recipe!!  

I found that the correct size pan and the right temperature is the key to a perfect crepe.  I keep the setting a little higher than is needed, but I am constantly picking up the pan.  I pick up the pan and pour a ladle full of mix into it as I am tipping it around and then put on the stovetop.  When it becomes loose in the pan, I pick up the pan off the stove top and flip it over.  It doesn't need long at all to cook the other side and then I pick it up again and slide it onto a plate and then start the entire process over again. 
 
Our favorite filling is Nutella and cut up ripe bananas with a couple of bananas on top with Nutella drizzled over.  Heavenly for sure!

I make ahead of time and freeze with parchment paper between each crepe and reheat and stuff when all the family is over.  Quick and easy.  

So happy I found this recipe, I will make it again and again with zero modifications.

I make this every week. I double the recipe, but use 2 cups flour and 3 cups milk (remove 1 cup liquid). This allows me to use it easily for both savory and French style. This is the BIG secret to the batter working beautifully...for savory crepes you should let the batter sit one day. For French it is perfect in two days of sitting. The sitting allows the flour to completely dissolve and mix in with the other ingredients. Then...you can get a perfect texture without any misery. The other thing VERY important is the grill. It has to cook evenly and hot. I use a Tibos grill. Last thing, this is another big secret...I use 1 3/4 white flour and 1/4 wheat. This gives it a really lovely texture! I never thought I could get this right and can't believe I make them almost every day now.

These were REALLY good. Definitely my new favourite thing, and I will definitely be making these again very soon! Very easy to make. I used 2-4 tbsp each (I experimented) and started pouring from one side of the pan while tilting it slightly down. I then rotated the pan as necessary. No issues with them coming out nice and even. I used a ceramic pan with the stove on 4 (of 10) and they cooked perfectly. Some of the edges got slightly crispy, but I liked it. I used some Jif salted caramel chocolate hazelnut butter in some and made a quesadilla-type thing in some of the others. Cheese, monterey jack queso, greek yogurt, and a small sprinkle of garlic/chile powder. They were impressively good. Still have a few left. Can't wait to play with fillings some more! Yum!

Easy, didn't require refrigerating the batter before cooking like my mom's recipe (which is good, but time-consuming!), and it worked really well with whole wheat flour. Thanks for the recipe!

This is the best recipe I have found! I add cinnamon and vanilla, and sometimes a bit of rum for an added flavor. Batter is perfect consistency - you just have to practice making crepes to get the hang of it.

Delicious! Followed the recipe exactly. I had to go back after making the first crepe and mix for longer because I had some lumps. After that I was good to go. I filled them with homemade applesauce and whipped creme.

Thank you so much for this! I've been trying to make decent crepes for AGES! Everything would either burn, or turn into crackers, or just taste weird. I'd blamed my stove, blamed the frying pan, blamed my useless self - but now suddenly great crepes! Thin, and soft, and easy, and with the right aroma of baking - yum! Thank you :))

Tried this recipe and I love the result! It's thin and moist enough to be folded - instead of dry and get cracked when you fold it. I filled it with sauteed apple - found the recipe from this site as well. My husband likes it that he ate 3 pieces before dinner! lol..

I used wok instead of non-stick flat pan as suggested here. A little bit messy at first, but after 2 pieces I started to get the trick; instead of pouring from the (middle part) edge of the wok, I poured the scratch on the middle part of wok with very low heat, and move it around quickly to spread the scratch evenly. Also, because the wok surface doesn't share heat evenly, I tilted the wok around to get the edge part cooked evenly without making the middle part burnt.

I was very suspicious because of the very high milk to flour ratio and the little sugar required by the recipe.  I assumed a typo.  Nevertheless, I followed the recipe and wow - I was wrong.  This is the crepe recipe I was looking for all my life.  The crepes tasted like the crepes I had in France.  Very good.  Thanks a lot for sharing!!!

I loved this recipe. The first time I made it I added a cup of sugar (I have NO IDEA how I managed that. But they were REALLY sweet. LOL. So I had to try again) This is a fantastic recipe, so thin and light. I followed another reviewer's instruction and stored them in an unsealed tupperware container and it kept them warm nicely. I don't see why people are so concerned with crunchy edges. I like that. Gives them another dimension of texture. I served them with homemade blackberry jam and whipped cream. I can't wait to do a savory version with mushrooms and goat cheese :) Thanks for the fantastic recipe.

Simple and effective.  VERY tasty-got kids to help.
Great with Nutella spread-before rolling add a layer of Nutella.

Use less oil at first.

MELANIESAYSHI is right about this recipe; it turns out great if you follow her tips! I needed a quick breakfast to throw together this morning because my boyfriend was leaving for a week, and these went together quickly and turned out wonderful.  I tried another popular crepe recipe from here a while back that turned out too thick, a lot like thin pancakes, but these were spot on. It seems obvious now that I remember how much butter went into these, but I did discover that I didn't need to use cooking spray in my nonstick pan (I thought it would help them turn out more like the picture, but it mostly made them greasy). Still, I got nothing but praise for these.  This is your winning crepe recipe for sure.

These turned out very well. Only adjustment was that I added some vanilla. I spread chocolate hazelnut spread on them, slice banana, roll and warm in a pan. Serve along side some fresh fruit and frozen yogurt! Heaven in my mouth.

This is a great easy recipe! I was surprised that the batter was so thin but it makes wonderful tasty light crêpes. I followed the recipe exactly and everyone loved them, I spooned the batter thin into the crêpe pan and it cooked quite fast, half the time on the flipped side. I stacked them and covered with plate cover until served...they were amazing:) Thanks Cyberchef.

The texture and flavor on these are fantastic. My cooking skills, not so much. I burned or tore about 6 crepes. Darn it. I forgot how fragile they are. I will keep practicing.

These are great! I just use a little more sugar than it calls for, because I like sweeter crepes.

loved them, thanks for sharing.  the only that worked better for me was turning the heat to maybe a low to medium so as to cook them a little slower.

These crepes are easy to make and taste wonderful! I always add a little vanilla to the mix, and sometimes I will add a little cinnamon and nutmeg. Our favorite fillings are cinnamon & sugar, nutella and bananas, or whipped cream, cream cheese and strawberries! Sooooo Good!!!

So great; I added 1 tablespoon of sugar instead of 1 teaspoon, and it was just the right amount of sweetness that it can be made into a savory crepe.  I didn't spread the batter all the way around the pan to make it easier to flip over, and I had the heat on medium, sometimes medium-low.  I would definitely recommend using a mixer.  I didn't because I didn't feel like cleaning it up, but alas my laziness was in vain because the batter had some lumps.

These crepes are delicious without any modification. I suppose a little vanilla would have enhanced the flavor, but even as they are they were wonderful. Yes you get crispy edges. I love that. One reviewer mentioned that if you pour from the edge of the pan it helps and I have to agree. It takes some practice to get just the right thickness throughout the crepe, but this recipe certainly makes enough batter to do that. In my 12" saute pan I can make about 15 or so. I might even half the recipe next time I make if for the kids. That's a lot of crepes!

I used whole wheat flower,since these were actually for breakfast :)  and added a bit of vanilla and there were perfect, I couldn't make them fast enough for my 2 yr old eating them!  Just a tip, I don't know if the wheat makes this more so, but I definately needed to be generous with the greasing or they stuck.

Very easy to make and perfectly light texture needed for crepes. I also liked the flavor, which was nonintrusive and didn't dictate what to put on the crepes. I made them exactly as it was written in the recipe without any alterations.

It was my first time to make crepes. I cannot believe I made such yummy crepes. The texture was very smooth and soft. It was as good as those you buy outside. My whole family loved it. It went well with all sorts of spreads. Thank you for the great but easy recipe. I will invite my friends for a crepe party soon.

No complaints for this recipe, it came out perfect. I lightly oiled the pan with palm shortening and poured the batter in from the side of the pan (keeping it tilted). You then swirl the batter around until it covers the whole bottom of the pan. Sounds simple, but not quite so. This takes practice, practice, practice!

I'm not sure what I did wrong, but I ended up with a frothy, foamy mess.   even tried to cook some of the 'batter', but it didn't set and I threw the whole thing away.  My eager kids just about cried!  Oh well, I'll try again and adjust things--maybe just use a whisk insead of an electric mixer next time.  I tried this because it looked fast and easy, and my old recipe takes more time.  It calls for combining the flour with the eggs and beating it for 5 minutes til it's elastic.  Then add the milk and butter til the batter is thin and ready to pour.  That's how Mom taught me.  Serves me right to doubt Mom!

Great recipe! I looked up several and tried different things and this one has the best consistency. It has to be liquid so that you can roll the batter around the entire pan quickly to get nice thin crepes. Do what another reviewer suggests and pour the batter onto the pan from the one edge and roll around the pan quickly. I added one egg yolk less to make it taste less eggy and 1 tbsp of rum for flavor.

Good basic recipe. I was making a dessert crepe so I added a little vanilla and it gave it a nice flavor.  spread a thin layer of nutella on the crepes, then some fried bananas, and rolled them up, and topped with whipped cream. Delish!

I did not care for this recipe.  Batter is too thin and way too eggy.  The finished product looked like some kind of freakish heap of scrambled eggs.  Will not use this again!

Fantastic crepes.  Because they aren't too sweet they work great for any filling.  I had them with ham and cream cheese and I had others with a little lemon and powdered sugar and the flavor of the crepe worked great with both fillings.  The butter makes all the difference.  Don't leave it out. Make sure not to get your pan too hot or you will have the problem MZOJIBWAY had.  Medium heat worked best for me.  I actually made these gluten free using rice flour instead of normal flour and adding a bit of xanthan gum (which probably wasn't necessary, I think the eggs would have held it together).  They worked fabulously.

It needed about one cup more of flour. Without the extra flour, it was too thin. Also, I added about two more tablespoon of sugar.

I thought this was a good recipe. Next time I will adjust the butter to only one tablespoon, as I thought it was too buttery for my liking. Also just was reading some other ratings and would like to add that this recipe was thin but as the chef you can decide how think or thin your crepe is and mine were not crisp at all! You should definietly try this recipe out!

These were delicious. Although when eating plain, I found them to be a little too eggy for my taste. Next time, I'll leave out one egg yolk, and see how that works. All the reviewers here either seem to love this recipe or hate it. I figured the ones who hated it probably did something incorrectly, so I was a bit worried since we're certainly not expert crepe makers. My batter seemed way too thin and I couldn't get all the flour lumps out, but the crepes turned out amazing in the end.

We just back from visiting France, and had crepes from a street vendor in Paris, so we decided to make some of our own. These were just as good, if not slightly better, than the ones we had. 

I did add 1/8 cup additional flour, which give it a little more thickness, and made it taste just like the orginal. For taste, I also added some more cinnamon. This also works great with soy milk. My husband loved them!

We got a crepe pan for a wedding gift so I thought I would try to make some crepes for the first time and they came out great.  My husband loved them!  The only change I made was using vanilla soy milk instead of regular milk because that is what we had and it worked perfectly.  Thanks!

Pretty good recipe.  I scaled it down to two servings and only made one that was way too thick.  Filled with butter, sugar, and Nutella, and topped it with powdered sugar and whipped cream, mmmm!  Next time I'll add more sugar to the batter and it'll be excellent!

Very good recpe! I followed recomendations from other cook's and added  bit of vanilla extract. I ate them with dulce de leche, a similar-to-caramel jam which goes amazingly well with crepes, pancakes and just about anything! If you get the chance to find this in your store, I highly recommend you buy some and taste it - especially if you have a sweet tooth! 
Thak you for this recipe!

This was my first time making crepes, my grandmother used to make them growing up. I found this recipe very simple and very tasty. Filled them with strawberry preserve and topped with whipped cream, delicious. The kids added their own special touch by adding chocolate syrup to theirs. Will make these regularly!!!

I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract to the batter. Once on the plate, I put slices of bananas in the middle. Then I blended blackberries, raspberries and milk together, poured it on and folded it. Loved it. Definitely gonna make it again.

This is a great recipe! It took some practice making them, and I actually really like the crispy edges.   It's very close to the recipe my mom made growing up.  I used sweetened vanilla Almond milk from Walmart and it maintained the right consistency with a good flavor.

Just made these for Christmas breakfast and they were perfect!!! Proportions were spot on. No adjustments needed. Butter in the batter makes the difference between real crepes and the Americanized versions. Thank you for sharing this recipe!!!!!

simple easy recipes.  have made several times.  this is my go to crepes recipe.  make crepes about 2-3 times per week for breakfast or desserts.  banana fosters is one of our favorite desserts which is quick and easy.  I pre-make the crepes, then after dinner with quests sipping after dinner drinks, I make the banana fosters.  friends are amazed with the skill and techniques.  why I don't know cause its actually very easy.  guess the big flaming skillet is a show.  they are impressed.

Quick, easy and tasty! Added vanilla and cinnamon for added flavor. Had to swipe extra butter on the pan so it wouldn’t stick.

The best recipe out of 5 I’ve tried (all highly rated). As for the butter, it should be 2 TABLESPOONs, not 2 teaspoons. I also added vanilla and more sugar, to personal preference; I added about 1/4 teaspoon of each. The house also smells so good after that new comers will want crepes.

I made these, my first crepes ever, in a very old cast iron pan, and they worked like a dream. The first morning, we had crepes with spinach, mushroom and tomato filling with white cheddar sauce. The second morning, I made them smaller and slathered with them homemade plum butter, and the third morning, I had enough batter for only four small crepes, topped with the same spinach mixture as before. I followed the recipe exactly except I put everything in the blender as other reviewers had suggested. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is excellent - and versatile. Great as-is for a sweet filling (I like a little more sugar - personal preference) (or to eat plain - SO good) To make it savory, I leave out the sugar, add parsley or other herbs then fill with ricotta cheese, prosciutto, bacon, ham, etc. VERY easy but as others mentioned, if you are having trouble it's most likely with the pan and the temp. I use a setting just below Medium on my gas range, a small pan which I mop with olive oil every 3-4 crepes and just keep rolling the pan until the batter sets - flip it when it loosens from the pan and cook the other side for just a few second - 'voila! Excellent!  (and everyone will think you're an accomplished french chef!

I’ve been making this recipe from All Recipes for years and it’s great. This morning I tried it by mixing everything in my smoothie blender (i have a nutri bullet). Eggs, milk, then flour and salt, then olive oil. They came out better than ever, and soooooo easy. 

Because we don’t do dairy, I use unsweetened almond milk and olive oil in place of butter and milk. Works fine. I don’t add sugar anymore because I usually pair my crepes with a mix of sweet and savory.  The sugar way is fine too. 

This recipe has been the right mix of flour, egg and milk for me always. I am French and learned how to make crepes in France, but this is an easier recipe but still gives me the result I want. 
I like that you don’t have to wait on the batter either (I was taught to let it sit for an hour).  I also store the batter and cook crepes up later with this recipe. 

I use a few drops on olive oil on my nonstick pan and swirl them around with a paper towel and that way have no issues with stickiness.

Super easy & quick enough to make for breakfast! I ran a stick of butter around the pan before each crepe... no vanilla needed (even for sweet crepes). The texture & taste was perfect! Will save this one for sure!

The best crepe recipe out there! I always come back to this one. Don’t trust a crepe recipe using water or anything less than 3 eggs! Have used this with gluten free and dairy free substitutions and the measurements worked perfectly. A+++++

This was, by far, the best crepe recipe I've ever used.  I did add a little vanilla as I was making a breakfast/dessertish crepe:)  For the size of my crepe pan, two tablespoons was not quite sufficient.  I used 1/4 cup (4 tablespoons) and felt that they came out just right and for those of you who felt they were too crispy, it may be that you just need to add slightly more batter to the pan.  The crepes were flavorful and easy to work with when putting in the filling.  This will be my go to recipe for crepes in the future.

This crepe recipe is very similar to the one I have used, but temporarily lost, since the 1980’s. The issue I had with this recipe is that it uses one too many eggs for my liking. The crepe is spongy and my daughter commented she could actually smell the egg in it. The batter stuck to the pan and was difficult to get to cook evenly. I think if one egg was omitted this would be a much better recipe.

This recipe recipe is so easy and delicious. My daughter has been asking to make crepes for at least a year.  I really thought I would never be able to make them. Well, we finally made the attempt, and we were very successful. My daughter, who has become a crepes expert, absolutely loved them. We will definitely be making them again. My only problem is now I need to figure out how to store the leftover batter.
NOTE: I added a teaspoon of vanilla and a a 1/4 cup of batter to make the crepes.

Outstanding. Followed some tips of another user. I used a medium sized pan on med high heat, sprayed with pam before each crepe. Used a ladle about 3/4 full poured all in on one side and then rotated the pan to cover. Once it started bubbling worked the spatula in and flipped.
Phenomenonal taste. I served with Nutella and strawberries inside. Topped with powdered sugar and maple syrup (real syrup only).

The recipe is fine.  If your batter is too thin, add flour.  Crepes take some finesse but they are not hard and the recipe is very much like all the others.  If you want them sweeter add more sugar.  Not that hard.  Be sure you pan has a consistent oiling and is very hot.  Each crepe should only take seconds to cook.  I separate mine with pieces of wax paper but you don't have to.

Perfection! I made zero changes. I whizzed the batter up in the blender, then let it sit for about 20-30 min while I made a strawberry and blueberry sauce.  The crepes were tender and perfect. We put a little cottage cheese in each one, and topped with the berry sauce and a little whipped cream. Such a fancy breakfast so easily made at home!

The recipe is very easy to make. I used the 3 tbsp additional sugar and 1 tsp vanilla as was suggested by another. It tastes great alone. I sprinkled a very small amount of powdered sugar on top. I suggest letting the batter sit for about 20 minutes before making. It seems the longer you wait the better the crepe looks and tastes.

Add a little  of vanilla if you're serving them for dessert. You can also rest the mix for 3o minutes or more. If you fill theme with a spoonful of Nutella with strawberries and bananas they taste great.

I think its a recipe designed to only go onto a traditional crepe griddle. My non-stick skillet couldn't keep up unfortunately. Tasted good, but will probably not use again.

This is a good recipe. When I wanted "French Pancakes" (mom used to call them that); I substituted Buttermilk for regular Milk, added an additional egg, and additional 1/2 cup flour. The flavor really comes out with a little butter on top and maple syrup!

So easy! I made it exactly as it is here and it really was that easy. Not having a crepe pan I used a non-stick ungreased pan and it worked great and probably helped get them “round”. Also easier to get the spatula under the edge to flip. I did follow the “let the batter sit a while” advice as that is what I do for pancakes.

Liked the way the melted butter was integrated into the batter.  I like this French Crepe recipe much better than the recipe I grew up with which was a more eggy style.
Our traditional family recipe calls for spreading a bit of strawberry jam and powdered sugar and then rolling them up (AKA roll-up jellies).
We made the batter in a blender -- worked great (add flour last and slowly).

Best recipe for crepes.  Here are some tips I have acquired through many trials.  Let your batter sit for at least 1/2 hour .  I use a blender and leave it in the container, when ready I give a few quick pulses, my pan sits with no butter on slightly above medium until hot and use a paper towel with the smallest amount of butter and wipe to coat I then have a 1/4 cup of batter ready set your pan back on burner for a few seconds and pour the measured batter and use your wrist to coat quickly.  Adjust the burner as you go.  Be patient the first one or two usually don't look the greatest but still taste  light, beautifully thin, I have tried at least 5 different recipes and this one is my go to favorite.  Thanks cyberchef

Egg ratio was a bit off, wasn't nice to eat. Ended up adding another 3/4c flour, a bit more milk and more sugar and it ended up okay.

Perfect recipe!  My fiance used to travel with his family overseas.  He said that the crepes made reminded him of France and the street vendors that would sell crepes on the street.  So easy.   Secret is in the pour....I had no trouble with the middle being thick as you just need enough to cover the bottom of the pan.

I’ve made many a lot of crêpes in my time, with a few favorites for different purposes. Every now and then I try a new basic recipe to see if it might be a new best. This recipe came out heavy, dense, and didn’t brown well. I believe it is the large amount of milk that doesn’t work.

I do not know if I'm just not a good person to make crepes, if the pan was on a too high heat setting, too low, or if my batter came out properly as instructed but they were delicious. With Nutella and some cherry pie filling to top them off they were yummy so maybe I have to adjust to a 12 inch skillet as someone else posted or refrigerate the batter for a half hour or so or maybe just adjust to my liking. Other than that for my first time it was decent I'd say. My Mom and sister enjoyed them

AWESOME recipe! I made a batch to make a lasagna instead of using noodles. The result was light and delicious. I did leave out the sugar in from the recipe and added a few dashes of onion powder to make is more savory! I suggest take your best lasagna recipe and use the crepes instead of the noodles. You won't be disappointed!

Enjoyed them. I ended up adding 1/2cup of water and we liked them even more. The kids said that with the thinner batter they were crispier. Thank you for the recipe.

Awesome weekend breakfast or fun guest dessert recipe. This recipe puts all other crepe recipes to shame. I do add a dash of vanilla extract to the batter. Another crepe tip is preparing the fillings ahead of time and adding them while the crepe is on the last side to cook. The heat helps spread things like Nutella or peanut butter. We also like to chop fruit and add a bit of sugar and let it sit to form a simple syrup. You can also leave out the sugar and make more savory crepes. Versatile and surprises guests by how simple they are to make at home.

This worked beautifully with a few small changes for success. Make the recipe exactly as stated its perfect. On the cooking temp, I had mine on a medium-low about 4 for a hot stove. The secret was just a bit of bacon grease - very sparingly in the pan with a paper towel and they cook and flip perfectly. it took about 4 tablespoons and then with a silicone spatula keep working the batter very gently to the outside until just set up. Flip out to a dinner plate and file back into the pan for the other side. I made these for savory crepes with ham and brie and saved the rest in the fridge for come cooked apple for dinner. My German Gramma would have approved!!! They aren't lo-cal this way but they were perfect for dinner crepes - just like the ones I had in France.

This was my first attempt at crepes and it turned out pretty good.  It took me about three botched crepes before I got the flip right.  I had to wait a little longer than I thought to make sure it was solidified before flipping.  Also I tried swirling the batter in the pan slightly less so that it wasn't crazy thin, and that helped.  I ended up with around 10 crepes and only needed to go through half the batter.   I'll use this recipe again.

In general, the recipe tasted good and worked well. However there are two things I would like to address:
1. You can make this recipe with a normal whisk just mix it really well.
2. This recipe takes a bit of practice and you have to troubleshoot on your own. I recommend not using too much butter and also making sure you don't over-whisk it for a fluffier taste.

First time ever making crepes and they came out great. I wanted the same texture and taste of those I've had in Germany and this reciepe was perfect. I used a crepe pan, spreader and spatula. The spreader worked great to even out the batter once poured. I also used 4 tbsp of batter per crepe, which worked great. 2 tbsp didn't seem like enough and it was breaking.

Easy and delicious! My 16 and 11 year old daughters loved them! We added 1tsp vanilla extract to the batter for a little flavor. When I had the heat on medium high the edges were getting crispy so then I turned it to medium low and they were much better. We filled the crepes with fruit (and a few with Nutella) and rolled them.  Absolutely delicious!

The batter was definitely way too thin but I added what eventually ended up being about another ¾ c of flour and it was perfect. Great consistency and flavor.

Made this twice and both times turned out very good.  Family preferred a little sweeter crepe, so adjusted the sugar, otherwise it is a simple, fast, easy recipe to make.  Used 1/4 cup of batter for each and they cooked up wonderfully.  The crepes are sturdy and easy to flip.

My family has made crêpes for breakfast for as long as I can remember. We make them Romanian style.  This is the BEST RECIPE for crêpes that I have ever used and I will continue to make this one.  Simple. Delicious. Very tender. Not heavy at all.

I don't cook.  However, I tried to make these and they were good!  One thing left out, LET THE BATTER REST!!!!  To begin with there were too may air bubbles and the crepes looked crazy.  (Tasted good)  I took a knife and smacked as many of the bubbles as I could without adding more air.   I added vanilla and almond extract since I was making them into something sweet.  I read most of the instructions from folks and it really helped me to pour around the outside and let the batter shift to the inside.  ALSO, I picked my pan up and held it close the the bowl while I scooped out the batter with a 1/4 cup.  I did this AFTER I dripped batter everywhere.  Yep, really don't cook much.  ;)

Two tablespoons is nowhere near enough batter. 

You need a good ladle and a half for an 11 inch crepe pan with an edge. One ladle for a pan without a lip. Will get about 10 to 12 crepes from the batch.

Fantastic recipe! It is delicious and the fact you mix the butter in it looks like it makes the crepe more crispy. Also, Melanie's comment helped me a lot, since I started this time making the crepes from the edges in! Love it!

It was a really good recipe. I put half a cup of pancake mix and half a cup of all purpose flor just to make them a little more crispy. I didn't substitute anything else. It was really good. With the same crepe batter, I made Nutella crepes and also scrambled egg and cheese crepes.

Great recipe, although i do not take 2tbsp and stir them around. Like one of the reviews said i just take the pan in my hand in the sky, pour the batter on the side and tilt the pan until it is covered with batter. When its not liquid and white anymore (about 30 secs), i flip it. This made about 9 crepes for me. I love it with syrup or powdered sugar or chocolate.

You don't need an electric mixer. Just be sure to stir well before each time you put batter in the pan.

Viva La France!  

Per other reviewer suggestion, made them sweeter using 1 T Baking Splenda.  Did not need butter on non-stick cookware, cooked for 1 minute, loosened edges and flipped, cooked 30 seconds more.  Filled with fresh peaches sweetened with Baking Splenda plus a shot of almond flavor and Pampered Chef spice and sweetened whipped cream.  OK, it's like ordering a Diet Coke with a sundae, but every less calories helps!  Bon Appetit!

Crepes are tricky; the batter rolls well. I used an immersion blender and made the batter in a large measuring cup and to more easily control the amount of batter going into the pan. I also used you nice big pan for this, as I wasn't sure how much the batter would spread. Worked out great!

I made this recipe as is and it works. I made large crepes so the 2 tbsp per crepe was not even close to enough. I probably used approx. 100mL per crepe. I was using a measuring cup to pour the batter onto the hot pan, which I just greased with a coconut oil spray.

 I actually put all my ingredients into my ninja blender and blended for a few seconds until smooth. Then I sifted the dry ingredients directly into the blender and blended again til smooth. This gave me a perfect consistency. I poured some batter into my already used measuring cup since it made it easy to pour and after a few crepes I poured straight from the blender. I recommend pouring from something smaller with a spout to control the amount of batter going into the pan. Or use a blender with a spout if you have steady hands or are just lazy! 

I'd say the taste of these was pretty good as a basic recipe. It didn't have much flavour so next time for a savory crepe I will add a tiny bit more salt and for a sweet crepe, a tiny bit more sugar. Otherwise these are great! I just have to work on not breaking them in the pan while flipping them as they are so large. 

*just FYI I made these crepes into triangles by filling them on half a side, folding in half, putting slightly more filling on a quarter (half of the half exposed) and then fold again. You can cook the other side if you want it to be evenly crispy by flipping at this point. They will soften once you take them off the heat anyway.

This recipe is great! It's suoer fast and easy to get the ingredients together. Wonderful taste that goes with both savory and sweet fillings. My second go around I just added a bit of vanilla since I wanted something a little sweeter. It did take me a few tries to get them to look nice -- the batter is thin, so it starts cooking just after it hits the pan. My first few crepes ended up looking like interpretive art, but I didn't care much since I was just cooking for myself.  Don't get discouraged! 3 crepes later I was getting a nice, round thing that actually kind of resembeled a crepe. If you have the time and patience, I would definitely recommend this recipe.

Tried this recipe right after I poured away another recipe down the trash. So I am able to tell the difference, immediately :)
Followed this recipe exactly, and it yielded 8pcs of 8" nicely browned, fragrant, right thickness crepes. I used 1.5 scoops with a soup ladle, on a 8" frying pan. 
Add a little more sugar if you like it a little sweeter, or dash of vanilla. I did mine per the recipe,  and it was just great with pre-baked apple cinnamon,  and Nutella banana fillings.

love it ! I didn't use an electrical mixer or anything . I just hand mixed it . everything turned out great . the only thing I did different was add some vanilla extract and after mixing everything, I set it inside the fridge for about 15 to 20 mins . it tasted and looked super good. very good recipe !

I will definitaly be making these again. The best crepes I have ever ate in the whole of my entire life. However I did use 2 large eggs instead of 3 because when I made these before they were a bit stiff so the kind of broke when I folded them. However if that is what you're looking for then the recipe is perfect. Also I did add some olive oil into the mixture just to make the crepes stick less to the actual pan which really does help. Once again the best recipe out there. !!! Very very nice. They are perfect in the middle and have a crispy edge which tastes delicious. If you like your pancakes sweet then I would also reccomend adding some more sugar. I added another 4 teaspoons.

I added vanilla extract because I was making a dessert style, but I would leave it out if making a savory crepe. I was a little skeptical because of tge one bad review on here, but once I tasted them...hands down the best! Even my kids gobbled them up far more than others I've made. I think it's in the texture. They were perfect.

Absolutely the best crepe recipe I have tried to date. The proportions were exactly correct and they turned out light and fluffy. Even my picky children ate them all up! As for anyone who has posted such negative reviews about batter being too thin or burning, then clearly you don't understand the difference between a European 'thin pancake' and a North American 'thick' one. Crepes are meant to be thinner in general, as they can be filled and rolled up as well as the ratios of flour to milk and egg are different. Also the heating on your stove is key and there really is a fine line between cooking the crepe well and letting it burn. Check your elements! The third thing is that crepes are cooked based on feel. You will know when its ready to flip if the crepe slips cleanly from the pan, or when its the right colour when cooked through. Either way, you have to work with this a number of times like anything, to get the feel for cooking a crepe. You can also doctor up the recipe and add whatever you want - lemon zest, chocolate chips, cheese, fruit, anything that suits your fancy. The possibilities are endless.

I love crepes and I've been making these for awhile, yet I can't figure out why they often come out crispy instead of soft so that they can be rolled easily. Perhaps too much butter? Also, I miss my upside down crepe pan from Nordic Ware - they don't seem to be making them any more and I lost mine during a move.  Perhaps someone on this website could help? Thanks.

We whipped up a couple of batches of these on Christmas morning and stuffed them with whipped cream. They were light, festive and a big hit with my family. We are talking about making them a tradition.

Incredible recipe! I thought it would be completely IMPOSSIBLE to make crepes at home, and I was afraid they would not taste the same as in restaurants. Boy was I wrong! It was so simple and it tasted amazing. One thing I did add in to the advice of some others was adding 2 tablespoons of vanilla extract (for dessert crepes). It made it a little sweeter and gave it a really great taste along with the fruit filling I made. Can't wait to make this again for all of my friends!

I cut this recipes to 1/3 for a one person breakfast, olive oil instead of melted butter in the batter and simply wisked the dry ingredients from the sifter into the already beaten egg/milk mixture. It made five perfect 7-inch crepes. Quick, easy and good! quick tips - stir the bowl before making each crepe and make sure your pan is hot enough.

I've never made crepes before. I have seen it done but thought it was difficult. This recipe made it so easy and quick to whip up! I had to half the recipe and modify it slightly. I added an extra bit of sugar, and when cooking, I didn't measure 2 tbsp, I just coated the bottom of the pan. My hubby lived these and I can't wait to make more.

I made this with 2 extra large eggs. I was a professional baker so I know that eggs size is always a variable.  They turned out perfect. The trick to making great crepes in to spread the batter evenly in the pan. You can use a crepe spreader (sold on Amazon) or a spatula, but you must get the batter in an even layer or the thicker areas with not be cooked as well as the edges which will be overcooked. Crepes are an egg batter, this should be expected.

Easy and tasty. What more could you ask for?

It took me a bit to figure out the timing on my stove so I messed up the first three but I ended up making about 2 dozen small ones.

I tried to make this twice and both times it was to watery and it clumped up when I added butter. I tried it again and I had the same results. Also, the edges burn quickly as well.

I added a bit more sugar. Used non stick crisco for frying and more mixture for frying.. other than that everything was the same.. came out great.  My family loved it

I liked this recipe. The only thing I did different was I used enough batter to coat the skillet. This way the crepes weren't to thin. Also, moving the skillet around after you poor the batter helps make even crepes! Yummy overall!!

I tried these with my friends and they were a hit. They came out perfectly and tasted great with the rest of the meal. I'd say they would work well as both a sweet and a savory recipe.

I've made these countless times and this recipe has never failed me!  The proportions are perfect and it even tolerates a little over cooking (when you get distracted)  Leave out the sugar and optionally add a touch more salt when making these for a savoury dish.

Thank you Melaniesayshi and Dragonflygrrl for your helpful comments! I followed the recipe and your instructions and together, even my first crepe was successful and delicious! This was a long awaited first attempt at making crepes, and never thought I could enjoy my own as much as the Creperie, but these were truly excellent! Thank you, thank you!

Short ingredient list, easy preparation. 
I made mine using the electric blender (won't wake up everyone on low setting). The crepes are tasty. The 2nd batch was made using a little light-brown sugar. You must make sure you move the pan around to thin out the liquid batter as much as you can before it sets. I use a little spray bottle with olive oil to keep the pan lightly oiled after several pancakes or crepes.

I love this recipe,  it is my favourite because it is super thin and slightly crispy around the edges. The secret is having a slightly bendy spatula to lift up the pancake to flip. Or asbestos fingers! But all worth it for this super light delicacy.

I know crepes batter must be very liquid-y so you can get thin and crunchy crepes, but I believe proportions this one were really off. I halved all the measurements to prepare only 6 and had to add 1/2 cup of flour to be able to cook them. After that, I got my delicious 6 crepes, thin, big and cruncy on the borders. YUMMY!

This recipes proportions were all off. Immediately after mixing, we realized something was really wrong with the batter. We added an extra cup and it was still way too weird. It ended up being this nasty, mushy, bubbly pile on the frying pan. I would NOT recommend this recipe for crepes.

Every time I have a bite of these crepes the smooth delicate melt in your mouth texture gets me every time. Best recipe I have ever came across. I just added a bit of vanilla extract and more sugar to enhance the aroma of the crepe.

Not amazing, but pretty good. These crepes were easy enough for a beginner like me to make. I added a little more sugar to mine, but I'm sure it would be fine without it. Overall I love these crepes!

I just came back from Europe and wanted the traditional, large crepe that I loved there.  this recipe is great EXCEPT this serving size is for a small ( 6in) crepe.  I used a big pan and made the large type., using about double the batter for each crepe.  This  recipie is for a plain batter that you could make as either a main dish crepe or dessert crepe. But if you are going with a dessert crepe add a splash of vanilla to the batter. fabulous with greek yogurt and berries.

Excellent recipe, easy to make and successful on the first try! Replaced with whole wheat flour and brown sugar, and it tastes just as good. I like the crispy edges but for those who don't, make sure that the batter at the edges are not spread too thinly.

This recipe was fine. I put everything, except the flour, in the blender and blend it until it's smooth. Then I add the flour and blend it smooth again. Tastes like every other crepe I have ever had. Crepe batter is supposed to be smooth and thin and the edges should get a little brown.

As written this is a great recipe for savory crepes.  This morning I wanted something sweeter, so I upped the sugar to a tablespoon and a half, added a teaspoon of vanilla, and cooked using coconut oil.  Oh-my-god.  Perfect with strawberries and homemade whipped cream.

I have never made crepes. Now I have using this recipe and they came out marvelous. Yes the batter is very thin but with the right temp (for my stove med high) and nonstick pan they really worked. They take awhile to cook so you need patience. My friend puts jam and sour cream on the ones she makes but I wanted to try something different. I mixed a small amount of sugar (teaspoon?)with ricotta cheese. A couple drops of vanilla and I had a great filling. Something was still missing so I added a spoonful of unsweetened applesauce on filling and rolled up. They are so yummy!! I feel like a real cook.

I really like this recipe. I did have to make a few changes like no salt because I have salted butter, I used 1 tablespoon instead of 1 teaspoon of sugar and I added vanilla. And they came out perfect, but I would suggest 2 eggs because they were eggy but if you like that use all 3. I love this recipe and my mom wants them for Mother's Day this year. E

the recipe was perfect. the better has to  be thin. if you had added more flour. that means that you did it wrong.  you can add more sugar if you want it to be sweet.

This is a very good crepe recipe...as good as I have ever had. I only had skim milk on hand and so I was hesitant on attempting the recipe...I'm very pleased I did though. My crepes were gorgeous!  Our big Sunday morning breakfast will have this added to the menu. Thanks for sharing it.

Best crepe we've ever had! Left as is except added a tsp of vanilla. Served with Nutella, fresh strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, and whipped cream. Lined the pan with butter every few crepes and used about a 1/4 cup batter per crepe. About two minutes total to cook through - a minute and a half or so on one side and thirty seconds or less on the other side. Delicious!

This recipe do not have any mistakes. I make it many time with my cooking style and without any problem. The combination is the same like store products have. I put there one Tsp Vanilla Extract. You can use also dry milk with water and/or one cup water and one cup milk. For frying I use unsalty butter and melt the butter for each crepe separate in the pan.

An Excellent recipe. Just made 106 crepes easy as can be. So thin you can see through them and they float back onto the pan when they are flipped. (Really. No plopping here at all.) They taste great. Don't change anything, but a couple more helpful tips to those already posted.
1. Use a nonstick pan
2. Spritz the pan LIGHTLY with organic olive oil before each crepe. The salt in salted butter may cause sticking.
3. Use the recommended amount of batter, but you have to tilt your hot pan fast to spread the batter. Move quick.
Be patient while you learn to move the pan. I used 2 pans at a time and it took me about 20 to get them perfect...slow learner.
These are the lightest crepes I've ever seen. Enjoy!

Followed recipe as is (a rarity for me) and they were super perfect.  My French-Canadian step-mom use to make me crepes and this recipe is spot-on the same authentic taste as she use to make them accordding to her French grandmother.  I used the crepes to wrap bacon and a veggie filling.  Great success.  Impressed the man.

This is a great basic crepe recipe. It always hit the spot and the fact that it isn't a savory or sweet recipe lets you add whatever you would like as a topping.

For anyone who had issues with them coming apart, contrary to what logic would lead you to believe, I actually found that they held together BETTER when I used LESS batter and made them thinner. also, If you use a fork to scrape the edges into the center a bit right after you put the batter into the pan, it helps to eliminate a lot of the super thin crispy edges and gives them a nice rounded shape so they look a bit prettier. They go great as a savory or sweet crepe, but for sweet, I recommend adding a couple tablespoons of vanilla.

This was a great recipe. It was simple to make and my family loved them. I added a teaspoon of powdered sugar and a half teaspoon of vanilla for a bit of a sweeter taste. It was a bit better than the first batch I made following the recipe exactly.  The consistency of the batter was great and the crepes cooked up well.  This is my crepe recipe from now on.

This has to be the worse Crepe recipe going.  They are so tender.  You cannot turn them or get them out of the crepe pan without tearing them to pieces.  I have never used a worse recipe for crepes.

First time ever making these. They were awesome. I made them this morning and added ham and cheese. Furst one was a practice one in the frying pan, which didn't come out byood, but then I switch to the iron skilket and it worked great. Then I made them again after dinner and added cinnamon to the batter. For the treat I used vanilla ice cream, whiped cream and strawberries... yumm yumm good. Thanks for this recipe.

I liked this recipe. I halved it being it is just the two of us. I followed someone's suggestions and added a little more sugar and vanilla because I was making sweet crepes. If I was to make ham and cheese, I would not add the extra sugar or vanilla.  I also used 1/4 cup of batter for mine, but I also have an actual crepe pan. I did not flip my crepes. This will be my go to crepe recipe.

I did try this recipe and it was perfect. I substituted honey for the sugar though as I did not have enough sugar. 

There was nothing difficult about making this. You just need patience.

I set my stove to 4, which is just below medium heat. I just lightly brushed some coconut oil in my pan...not a glob of it. 

I used a small ladle to scoop my batter into my coconut oiled pan. Two scoops was perfect. One was not enough. Also, I did not have to scoop it into my pan any special way. I just scooped 2 scoopfuls and then lightly and gently swirled the batter around until it covered the bottom of my pan.

I let it sit for a bit and then gently shook my pan. When the crepe shook free, I knew it was time to flip it. The other side doesn't take as long as the first because it is already partially cooked.

I made a homemade strawberry compote to top these off. Super delicious!! I love this recipe.

Loved this crepe batter recipe. It was a little on the sweet side, which I like, but I wouldn't mind cutting back a little on the sugar next time. Only thing I did different was adding a little bit of vanilla. Delish!
(Correction, I misread the recipe and put in the wrong amount of sugar, next time, I will try the right amount! LOL)

Review from coco said it didn't work all the proportions are wrong. Well coco the proportions are perfect,these are the best yet. At first I thought the batter was to thin but it browned nicely and was good eats.

I was actually sweating while doing it.. it's too liquid and hard to turn over.. I wouldn't put 3 eggs.. it smelled like an omelette.. I'd put only 2 and next time i wouldn't put the butter.. at the end it tasted not bad but it was a bit heavy on the stomach because of the oil and butter.

This recipe is great! I filled it by spreading a little nutella and added some banana slices, as well as some strawberries slices. Also topped with banana and strawberry and sprinkled some powdered sugar on top. Very delicious!

Very good. These were like what I remember my mom making for us when we were kids. I couldn't find our recipe so I looked for one online and this sounded same or similar. I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla and buttered pan between pancakes to make flipping easier. A good non-stick pan is essential. I used 1/4 cup measure to ladle batter for each crepe which worked well for size of my pan. Unless you are super hungry, a half of recipe would be better for 2 people. Full recipe made 18-20 pancakes. We eat them with butter, powdered sugar, chopped pecans and fresh lemon juice sprinkled in middle then roll them up... delicious!

A great crepe recipe with an almost perfect consistency for making awesome thin crepes the way the French make them... as compared to the Basic Crepe recipe on this site this one was far thinner and I would definitely use it if you are looking for thin crepes... you can fill them with just about anything you want from pie filling to different fruits or even nutella (as a french foreign exchange students taught me)... any way you fill them they are excellent!!

these were awesome , hubby is french canadian. He thought they were just like his mom used to make. This was my first attempt at making crepes. For the size of pan I used I got 9, hubby said his mom made them a little thicker, could have been why I only got 9.

I am using this recipe for quite a few years already; my daughter grew up since and makes these delicious crapes herself for breakfast when her friends come for sleepovers. Kids like to have these crapes with Nutella and defrosted in microwave raspberries. I prefer savoury variations and occasionally can have the crapes as a wrap with smoked salmon (lox) or salmon roe (red caviar) and a shot of ice-cold vodka, because these crapes are much more delicate then traditional Russian bilini. Cheers!

While these did make a nice, thin crepe, it was a pain to get the batter smooth.  The best I could hope for was just very small lumps.  I think I'll stick with JENNYC819's Basic Crepes recipe.  Thicker, but easier to blend.

Toasts nicely but way too egg-y. Needed more flour or just less egg. Tasted closer to a thick french toast than a good crepe. I think the classic french crepe recipe has much less egg.

My weekend go to breakfast these days. I like top it with lemon juice and powdered sugar. This is a nice recipe because if you are starting out and new to crepe making you can just change the servings to 4 that way you only use one egg. I say this because when I made my first batch the crepes sorta resembled jelly fish. Instead of nice and round they were sea creature shaped. And depending on what size pan you use it may take more than 2 tbsp of batter. Too little batter and you won't get it all the way around the pan. Not that it matters, they taste awesome no matter what shape. 
*A few times I used substitutions for the milk and sugar and they were just as yummy.

My first time making crepes...first few weren't so great but then they got better and better. Good recipe. Had to use a blender because I couldn't find my mixer. 2 tbsps was too little for my big frying pan so I had a little trouble finding the perfect amount for my pan but it seemed thinner was better. We rolled em up with cinamon and sugar inside and sprinkled with powdered sugar and sprinkles then dipped in syrup. My toddlers LOVED em and so did I!

We needed a little something as an after dinner treat and my son decided to make these crepes. Am I ever glad he did, they were light and flavorful. He made a mango filling and topped his creation with a sprinkle of powdered sugar. Perfection!

My family LOVED these crepes! I added a little vanilla and they were terrific. No problem flipping them and they did crisp on the edges. My kids ate them with some cinnamon and a little sugar and a dollop of whip cream. They were fairly decadent for a brunch!

It's interesting to note that people have criticised the batter as being too thin and that the edges turn crispy,but that's exactly what I love about this crepe recipe. Also,I reduced the number of eggs to one,added some vanilla extract and voila...perfect!

Even though I've been making Nalesniki (Polish crepes) for many years, this recipe was amazing.  I need to get used to the delicateness resulting from the butter & more milk than used to in the batter (it was tricky turning them over) but everyone raves about them.

Followed the recipe exactly and filled them with apple pie filling and whipped cream. I made them pretty thick to speed things up. Yum!

Altered recipe to 1 tbsp sugar, added a 1/2 tsp vanilla and followed the directions in which you pour the batter in around (not from the middle like a pancake) and the swirl the pan to make sure it's even across the surface. 

These tasted great! So easy to make and overall a healthy breakfast (if you stick to fresh fruit as a filling).

Delicious, but I found using all purpose flour I had to increase the amount of flour to 1 1/4 cups.

My family and I loved these crepes. I've grown up eating them my whole life but my father and grandmother never passed the recipe along and this one is very close if not right on.

My family loved this recipe! I did add some vanilla extract to the mixture. We put peanut butter on the crepes with blueberries and slices of banana. Will def. make this one again.

Just wonderful! I only used more butter to fry the crepes. I added a little more suger- though not necessary. I applied Nutella chocolate spread and served it with cafe latte to a guest. A great breakfast on a cold morning, in deed!

Crepes are one of my absolute favorite foods! These crepes were pretty good! I usually just stick to making the ones from Bisquick, but today I decided to make our familys classic crepe breakfast with REAL homemade crepes. True, as some reviews said, they were rather "eggy" but we smeared some nutella and homemade jam from the farmer's market and they were a HUGE hit! Will definitaly make again!!!

Great recipe! The closest to my Grandma's that I've ever found. I doubled the recipe and added about 3 3/4 cups of milk instead of the full 4 and they were perfect!
