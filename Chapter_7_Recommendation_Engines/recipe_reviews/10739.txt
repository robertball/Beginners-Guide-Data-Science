This was a fantastic brownie recipe! I didn't have any German Chocolate Squares and used melted tollhouse chocolate chips instead and it turned out fine.  They weren't too sweet and the cream cheese flavor mixed with the brownie was just delectable! They disappeared in my house in one night! A keeper!!!

These are amazing... Totally amazing.  The key is using the right pan.  I tried an 8x8 glass pan and failed 3 times, they were either burned or not cooked in the center.  Finally i turned to a 8x8 nonstick and voilla.  Perfection.  Make sure to greease and flour the pan.  I added a bit more cream cheese (about half of a 250 g package).  Bake at 350 for 37 minutes and then turn off the oven and leave them in for 10 or 15 more minutes.  This insures they are cooked through while making sure the sides don't burn. Fantastic, thanks a bunch for sharing.

I have had alot of "flops" in my journey to be a better baker. But, after trying this recipe my confidence is renewed! These are just the best brownies ever! I only had 2 ounces of chocolate so I had to substitute the other 2 ounces with 6 tablespoons of baking cocoa powder and 3 tablespoons of oil, I also baked it for 5 min. less than the required time. But besides those  minor changes I followed the directions exactly, and they came out great! I encourage anyone who reads this to go ahead and make it for yourself. If you love brownies and cheesecake you got to try this one! Thanks for the recipe

I bake these brownies when I want to impress someone because these look more sophisticated than regular brownies.  I also like how these are not too thick or too sweet.  Like many people who tried this recipe, I increased the amount of cream cheese to 4oz.  Instead of saving half the chocolate batter, I saved only 2 to 3 tbsp of chocolate batter to spoon onto the cream cheese layer.  I get better marble look this way.

These brownies are delicious.  I used milk chocolate chips as a substitute for the sweet chocolate baking squares and microwaved them with the butter for 30 seconds to melt them....fast and easy.  This is a very good recipe!

I brought these brownies to a party where there were several other desserts including brownies.  These were gone first.  Delicious.  I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and made a bit extra of the cream cheese mixture.  Other than that I followed the exact recipe.   I baked them in a 9 x 9 pan so baked them for 25 minutes, turned off the oven and baked for another 5.  Perfect.

Easy to follow instructions.

I really enjoyed this recipe...a new twist.  I used 8oz cream cheese for a 9x13 pan which was a perfect amount.  Other reviewers mention that it's more cake-like.  I still think it's good. Maybe the cook who submitted it baked at a high altitude where cakes & brownies turn out flat.

This is a truly orgasmic recipe. I couldn't stop eating the batter. I used walnuts and a type of goat cheese since I am allergic to dairy, and it turned out great! I decorated the top with cocoa powder which went great with the swirls. Truly festive. It was gone within moments at the party I served it at. Lick your fingers amazing!

These are by far the best brownies ever!  They turned out perfectly and everyone loved them.  The last time I made these, I doubled the cream cheese part because I love cream cheese so much, and they turned out awesome!

This is the best brownie recipe! I made them for my sons Valentine's Party, and they were gone in no time. I didn't have the german sweet chocolate baking squares. I used unsweetened baking bars, added 1 cup milk chocolate chips, and upped the sugar to 1 1/4 cups. I also doubled the cream cheese mixture, and made double layer brownies, rather than swirled, and topped with red baking M & M's. This made an attractive dish. My husband who is a chocaholic, loved this recipe!

These brownies were not very good.  I like the idea of the cream cheese topping. But, I didn't care for the brownie base.  The batter was very liquidy and then real fudgy after baking.  I used 2/3 cup chocolate chips (4oz)to replace the baking chocolate, which is basically the same. But, I like a more cake like homemade brownie. Possibly using cocoa and oil like another reviewer it may have gotten more cake like. I had to take them out of the oven before the cheesecake topping got to browned.  But, the brownie part seemed undercooked unless that was supposed to be the texture? Only about 3 brownies got eaten from the pan, which is not normal in my home. I am going to stick to the Mmmm Mmmm Brownies I found on this site. I can always modify them.

This recipe was...underwhelming...at best. They weren't at all as Cream Cheesy as I wanted them to be, and personally I thought they were unnecessarily messy (You have to have a bowl for the chocolate, one for the cream cheese, one for the batter). I made it basically according to the directions with a few necessary substitutions because I was snowed in during a blizzard and didn't have all the ingredients :D. That was simply using cocoa powder with oil and sugar for the melted chocolate and 1/4 cup of applesauce for one egg because I ran out. I also didn't have nuts.  I'm currently eating one of these brownies with extra cream cheese on the side because you can't taste the cream cheese at all. There are simply much easier recipes for brownies just as good out there, and you can add cream cheese to those if you want.

I experimented with these a bit.  I did not think they were chocolatey enough so i added 1/3 of a cup of sifted cocoa to the melted chocolate.  Oh the bliss!  Wonderful brownies!

This was a very good recipe overall!! I shortened the baking time to about 25-30 minutes, because they looked more than done (and they were). I would recommend adding more cream cheese by a few ounces next time. There didn't seem to be enough to me. But other than that, these brownies are awesome!!

These were yummy!  I used semi-sweet chocolate and low-fat cream cheese.  They were very moist and kept well.  They were all gone in a few days!

This is definitely a 5 star brownie and had one very similar to this.   Having said this I sometimes change it slightly by incorporating finely diced and drained maraschino cherries into the cream cheese mixture (with a hint of almond extract).  This does not alter my review of 5 stars on this recipe but just another way of changing the flavors.   Highly recommend this brownie and for the reviewer who used a pyrex dish I agree that it isn't the right one!!having had similar experiences in the past.

My husband made these exactly as the recipe stated. He said they were delicious but he felt it needed more of the brownie mixture, so he may try it next time with 1 1/2 of the brownie mixture and leave the cream cheese part the same.

My sister and I made these together. We made two batches. The first was following the recipe exactly, and they turned out good. Everyone liked them. The second batch was made with just a bit more chocolate. People LOVED these.

This was a very easy to follow recipe. I did not have German chocolate so I used semi-sweet chocolate chips. I added another 3 or 4 oz of chocolate chips because I didn't think it was chocolatey enough. I would probably increase that to 5 or 6 oz extra next time. I would also lower the temperature to 325 and add more time so the top does not crack.

Not enough cream cheese, and very very cakey. These are definitly NOT brownies. More like chocolate cake with a TINY bit of cream cheese added. Won't be making again... ;(

This recipe was so easy to make and smelled so good while cooking. We could hardly wait till they were done. Since I can not put nuts in our recipes we omitted them and these still turned out great. Thanks for the great recipe!

Great recipe! Definitely going to use this as a base recipe for plain brownies as well. Using chocolate rather than then powder form makes a much better substitute!!
I promised my boyfriend I would send him some during my visit, but hopefully they'll still be some left before I eat them all!! :)))

Perhaps it was my fault this recipe didn't turn out well. I followed the instructions completely. The brownie batter ended up being very thick and there wasn't even enough to cover the bottom of my pan. At that point, I doubled the recipe and added about a half cup of milk. I was hoping this would make the batter a bit more flexible, and this is the only modification I made to the recipe. The brownies had a wonderful texture, but they were tasteless. The cream cheese mixture tasted too eggy and the chocolate didn't hold it's own. Maybe the milk messed things up. I will definitely try to make this one again just because the reviews are wonderful! Thanks so much anyway for the recipe!

WOW!  My chocolate part seized up and I really couldn't swirl with the white.  So, mine is more of a muddy color.  Kind of mad as this does take a bit to prepare.

Used semi sweet chocolate and an extra ounce of cream cheese. Pretty good, still a little sweet. Next time am using lemon juice or zest instead of vanilla in cream cheese mix for a little more tang. Also going with unsweetened chocolate. They are very moist not too heavy and not too cakey.

I cheated on this and used a boxed brownie mix, but the cream cheese topping was exactly what I was looking for.  Everyone loved them! Thanks!

These are pretty good, but they're not all that dense or rich (in my opinion). Also, I took them out after 30 minutes and they were a bit more than done.

These are more like a bar cookie than a brownie.  They are much thicker being in the 8x8 pan than I expected.

I brought it to work this morning and my colleagues describe it as "melt in the mouth" brownies. I made some changes to the recipe after reading others' reviews --> I increased the chocolate to 125g (used Cadbury Dark Chocolate with macadamia nuts) and 2 tbsp cocoa powder; 125g cream cheese (but I would increase the amount of cream cheese again the next time i'm making them); and finally I've also topped the batter with Choc Chips just before baking and waived the pecans. Great recipe and will definitely bake them again!

These brownies were very good, and based on other reviews, I melted about 6oz of chocolate instead of 4oz to make it more chocolatey.  Next time I think I will lay the cream cheese mixture last instead of plopping half the batter on top.  The batter is so thin that the cream cheese pretty much sinks to the bottom of the brownies so I didn't get a pretty swirl design.  But when it comes down to it, it is the taste that matters most.

AWESOME - AWESOME - AWESOME!!!! These are super moist - even the next day.  They are incredible warm - and just as good cold. They were thick & easy to make.  I did not have the German chocolate - so I used semi-sweet in place of - and they were just great.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I could not really taste the cream cheese.  I was expecting it to be more chocolatey as well.  They weren't bad, though.

Very tasty, moist brownies! I've made them a few times already. They were enjoyed by friends and family. I use a very generous amount of good quality chocolate chips to make them extra rich.

I didn't have any sweet chocolate, so I mixed semi sweet and milk chocolate chips together.  It tasted ok..., but I felt is wasn't sweet enough.  Other than that, it was delicious. : )

i substituted 3 tblspoons of cocoa and 1 tblspoon of salt free margarine for every square of sweet german chocolate that the recipe calls for.  i also substituted mascarpone cheese for cream cheese.  worked great for me a rich fluffy textured brownie is what resulted.  as for the marble effect i only saved about 3 tblspoons of the choc mixture to put on top of cheese mixture.  very easy to do

So good!  Perfect as is, but 8" square is too small a batch!  Definitely more cakey than dense brownie.

These were TREMENDOUS! After reading the other reviews, I increased the amount of chocolate & cream cheese. Instead of swirling the cream cheese, I just put the cheese mixture on top of the brownie so the brownies were white on top- that way you can taste the cream cheese part better. I also used walnuts instead of pecans. It was my first time making brownies from scratch and they turned out perfectly!

This is an excellent recipe!  I took the advice of another reviewer and doubled the cream cheese mixture.  It was delicious!  Since I didn't have any German's sweet chocolate, I used 4 squares of bittersweet chocolate and 1.25 cups of sugar.  Everyone loves this dessert!

Very good and moist!  I like my brownies a bit gooie, so I always set the timer to about 5 minutes less than the recipe calls for.  that way I can be sure to pull them out at just the right moment.  I didn't have german sweet choc on hand, so I used semi sweet morsels instead.  Can't wait to try this recipe again with the sweet chocolate.  thanks!

I followed this recipe to the letter...and the result was bland, pale-colored brownies.  Neither the chocolate nor the cream cheese was enough to make any flavor impact.  The brownies weren't very thick - baked more like a cake.  Try adding more flour to the cream cheese mix - that was too runny.  The reason this recipe achieved such a high rating is the changes reviewers made accidently.  Using chocolate chips or dark chocolate greatly enhances the chocolate flavor and brings out the subtleties of the cream cheese.  Use as dark of a chocolate you can find - the sugar will compensate for the bitter flavor.

Over all, not a bad brownie, but not one to write home about either.  I will try again with a different type of chocolate perhaps - and maybe adding some chocolate chips to the batter.  I also had trouble getting the middle done without overbaking the sides, but can play with that too.

The funny thing about this recipe: The very first time I made it, I misread the directions (or just got ahead of myself) and mixed EVERYTHING together except the melted chocolate. I didnt read that I was suppose to swirl in the cream cheese mixture. So I just poured the choc. on the batter in the pan and swired it around a bit. ..They were delicious! I didnt keep them for very long at all! ...However, the second time I made them, I did it the right way, and I must say, they werent neary as good as they were the first time. I was kind of disappointed!...So, I will keep this recipe, but the next time I make them, I will prepare them the way I did the first time (by mixing the cream cheese and brownie mixture together, then swirling in the melted choc.) Theres something about the cream cheese mixed in the batter that gives it a REALLY nice texture and taste that you just dont get when its separated....They'll be great! THANKS!!

Mmmm, first time making brownies that actually worked! I did leave the nuts out cause I hate nuts and I didn't have them, and I used a 9 inch pan instead, had to cut down baking down by 10 minutes, other than that, it was perfect [oh yeah, increase the choc and cream cheese, yum]

I made these for the second time last night.  The first time I doubled the recipe and got confused as to what step I was on and ended up adding way too much sugar to the cream cheese mixture!  The brownies tasted okay but were not great.  This time I was very careful to follow all of the steps exactly (still made a double batch) and was rewarded with fantastic brownies.  These are a bit more difficult than regular chocolate brownies but well worth the time and effort.  I will definitely use this recipe again and again.

i love cream cheese, and i wanted to make somemthing easy and plentiful for church, unlike cheese cake which takes more work and more ingredients, THIS recipe is the best and you cant go wrong, everyone at church loved this,but dont just throw the ingredients together otherwise it me be dense, i also took advice from another reviewer who said she put chocolate with butter in the microwave, this was super fast and easy, and so YUMMY,,,,you can control how much chocolate you use,  if you love choccy then add lots, if not, just add a few squares,you cant go wrong,,,,thankyou.

Beautiful result! They look good and taste better. I served them for dessert last time my boyfriend's grandparents came over, and what a hit! I defintely scored some 'brownie points' with them, thats how good they were.

This came out very nice. I followed what reviewers suggested: increase the amount of chocolate and cream cheese. Also I baked it for 35 minutes and left the pan in the oven after turning it off. I also used 2 tbs of no-transfat margarine to cream with cream cheese (margarine is easier to cream than butter). The cream cheese layer at the top was very appealing visually and added a really rich cheese flavor to chocolate.

Delicious! We couldn't find "German Sweet Chocolate" so we used half Ghirardelli semi-sweet and half Ghirardelli 60% cacao chocolate (and the brownies were quite sweet). The recipe doesn't specify when to add the pecans, so we sprinked them on top and it worked fine. As always, I used a silicone baking pan so greasing was not necessary.

These brownies are divine!  I love a really rich chocolate taste and some reviews indicated that it wasn't that chocolate-y.  So I used unsweetened chocolate and increased the sugar in the chocolate mixture to a little over a cup.  I also added a little strong coffee.  

Because of other reviews, I increased the cream cheese to four ounces and I'm glad I did.  Also, I didn't have any nuts, but they still came out REALLY DELICIOUS.

This Recipe is SO great! I used a 9x13 pan and doubled it, and was perfect. The cream cheese is not overpowering like other recipes, and compliments the chocolate very well. The only thing I recommend is if you're trying to spread the chocolate after you drop it in the cream cheese, it works better using a toothpick.

I will take a pass on making this recipe again. It was kind of mediocre. The texture isn't really like a brownie but somewhere between a brownie and a cake. The taste was okay but only after significantly increasing the amount of chocolate and cream cheese. Had I not made those adjustments,  they would have been very bland. After adding more chocolate and cream cheese, it still made a tasty treat but definitely not what I was looking for.

Awesome! Omitted the nuts due to allergies. I used semi sweet baking squares instead of German Chocolate. My teen boys love them. Not overly sweet. Great for freezing and popping in school lunches for a little treat! They keep asking for them.

These were amazing, as another comment mentioned, they just seem like a much more impressive dessert than your average brownie. Although there were a few steps that were time consuming, I think once you make these it will get easier the second time around. Taking from what others did, I used dark and semi-sweet chips in place of the German chocolate (same amount), then added some cocoa (about 3 tablespoons) to my brownie base batter. Still, I think the chocolate flavor could be intensified even more. I used four ounces of cream cheese, again, as others had suggested but followed the rest of the directions for this layer. Then, I used almost all my brownie batter for the base and plopped the cream cheese mixture down on that, spreading it carefully. I had enough brownie batter left to put about eight small dollops on top of the cream cheese layer. Drawing a sharp knife through the three layers created a lovely marbled effect. Baked for twenty eight minutes exactly and cooled for an hour. Oh my, I never want a "regular" brownie after this one. If I can have success with this recipe, any beginner can feel confident in trying this one. This is one of the best recipes I have found on here. Thank you!

I used semi sweet chips instead of the German chocolate. I melted them with the butter in the microwave for about 30 seconds. This was super easy to prepare and came out perfect after 40 min, 350° in an 8x8 Pyrex. The only thing I will change next time is the amount of sugar, it's super sweet for me following the 1 cup called for in the recipe.

They aren't chocolaty,  they aren't cream cheesy, and they definitely aren't the brownies in the picture.  I tried the recipe a second time, using 12 ounces of nestle toll house semi-sweet chips and six aounces of cream cheese, and they came out pretty good except that they were over cooked along the crusts and undercooked in the middle. And they do sort of taste just like chocolate chips. All things considered,  rather than trying to adjust this recipe, I recommend just finding a better one.

Love, love this recipe! I made a double batch in a 9x13 square cake pan for my friends birthday, she's not big on birthday cake, and as an added touch I drizzled caramel 
sauce while it was still warm yum. Then I made a double batch up and made it in a bunt pan for Thanks Giving, it took about an hour to cook at 350 degrees and I did the same drizzled caramel sauce over top, not a piece left. It is wonderful with ice cream warm or even chilled still yummy.

I wanted a thicker cheese layer so I increased the cream cheese to 8 oz while keeping the same amounts of sugar, flour, egg and butter.  And I just topped the brownie with the cream cheese layer without swirling. That came out very well.    Overall the brownie was extremely good, gooey and not too sweet (our family is the "less sweet the better" type). It stores very well in an airtight container, still gooey and chewy after almost 18 days in the fridge (I have one tiny piece left as proof).    Have also doubled the brownie layer with an 8 oz cream cheese layer, baked in a 10 inch springform pan for 40 mins.   Have tried double the brownie layer and double the 8 oz cream cheese layer....doesn't work. Too much cheese but that was just my own opinion.   One thing though .... it's terribly difficult to cut. Tried many ways with : damp/dry cold knife; damp/dry warm knife, a length of string, plastic knife, rubber spatula.... and sorry haven't found a no-mess way yet.  P.S. I cheated .... I cut 1/4 cup of sugar from every quantity of the brownie part.  Have also mixed white and brown sugars in varying parts with no noticeable difference in the results.

Followed many reviewers' advice to increase the amount of cream cheese and chocolate, and these came out great.  Soft and moist cream cheese top and chewy fudge brownie base. I used normal semi-sweet chocolate and it turned out just fine.  Will certainly make again.

These brownies were okay.  However, they were no better than a good boxed brownie mix, in my opinion.  They were not worth the time and effort to make them from scratch.

I found the consistency of these brownies to be very good; slightly chewy, and a little cakey. However, the flavor did not wow me. Neither the chocolate nor the cream  cheese flavors were very strong.

Doubled this recipe and put it in a 9X13 pan. Increased baking time by about 12 minutes. Turned out to be more of a cake than a "brownie". Still very tasty. Go ahead and try this recipe, you won't be dissapointed.

These brownies were perfect--I didn't change anything except for to substitute semi sweet chocolate chips for the walnuts, which made them extra fudgy. They ended up only taking about 20 minutes in the oven instead of 30. A great recipe.

I've kept everything the same except used more cream cheese as 3 oz is not enough to spread over the brownies to give it that marbled look

Always disappointed when a recipe seems to be rated well by other then when I try it I just don't understand why. Very little flavor and more cake like texture then a brownie. Cannot taste cream cheese or chocolate much. Very expensive for the turnout.

Wow...these were so good that I had to throw them out. I made the mistake of making them while my husband was at work and I couldn't keep my hands from reaching in for another one. I finally had to throw them away for the sake of my hips!! I am not kidding!
