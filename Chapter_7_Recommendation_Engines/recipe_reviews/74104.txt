I followed the recipe exactly and all the cheese clumped together in the bottom of the pot. I think it needs some flour as a binder.

Where's the gruyere cheese, and the kirsch, and the dry white wine?  That recipe is definitely NOT a true swiss fondue recipe

I thought this was great.  Inexpensive, everyman ingredients and VERY tasty. Took my time to warm it up to avoid clumping. I love it that Nodaysoff invented it.  Kudos!

This one is definitely not my favorite. Too much work and not enough detail in the instruction.
