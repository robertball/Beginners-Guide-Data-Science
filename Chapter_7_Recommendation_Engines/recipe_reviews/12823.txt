WOW! I made this while on vacation with friends on the Outer Banks. Everyone loved this. I added a few things, which turned it into a mega-lasagna, or The Lasagna That Ate New York. I used a pound of lump crab, bay scallops, and shrimp in separate layers. I also added a layer of ricotta cheese mixed with a couple of beaten eggs.  For the sauce I took the water I used to boil the shrimp, added a little white wine, and reduced it to about one cup.  I started the sauce with the butter/flour roux, gradually added milk, shrimp reduction, and half-and-half. I also added Old Bay seasoning, paprika, a few dashes of Tabasco, and some basil.  Total liquid was approximately five cups, but I was making a big lasagna. I added the grated parmesan to the sauce last. I layered in this order between the pasta: crabmeat, ricotta, scallops, shrimp.  The scallops were small so I did not need to pre-cook them. It's important to let this rest 15-20 minutes after removing from the oven so your lasagna squares will hold together when serving. This made a fantastic dinner with garlic bread and a mixed green & romaine salad. Thanks for making everyone happy at the dinner table!

I tried this recipe on a crowd of family members for my son's confirmation party (I never do new reicpes on my family they are very picky) They raved about it and all asked for the recipe.  I also added 3 tsp. of Old Bay season ( a Maryland thing) to the white sauce and a layer of ricotta cheese (2 cups ricotta cheese, 1 cup shredded mozerrella, 2 tsp. parsley, 1 egg and of course 2 tsp. Old Bay season)in between the seafood layers.....What a hit!  Thank you!

This recipe is a great idea. I liked the taste, but I added 2 Tbsp. Old Bay to the white sauce, as someone suggested. That was too much, and it made the dish too salty. Next time I'll add only 1 Tbsp. Like any lasagna, it's a time-consuming dish, but it's well worth it.

Loved the recipe and will definitely be making this again. This is what I did: I added some garlic powder (~2 tsp) to the sauce. My pan was a little bigger, so I only had two layers plus the top. I also slightly chopped the shrimp with my mini food processor. Added just a touch of  parsley on the top before baking. It turned out FABULOUS! This recipe is a must try if you enjoy seafood.

this is a nice lasagne if you're looking for something elegant.  I added a layer of spinach, though, for color.  Also, I wouldn't recommend baking the entire 45 min., that was way too long.

I made this recipe over the last weekend and it came out great!  By reading other reviewers I've made some modifications: increased the sauce by 1 cup; used 1 6oz jar of good parmesan cheese (put 4oz into the sauce and reserved the remaining to combine w/ 1/2 cup of bread crumbs and spread on top of lasagna); added some oregano, garlic powder and Old Bay seasoning to the sauce; used 1 12oz package of shredded mozzarella w/ 1 cup of ricotta plus 1 egg and some oregano; and last but not least I used the incredible 'No Boiling Lasagna' from Barilla - hassle free, time saving, perfect cooking!  Super delicious lasagna, thanks!

Very tasty!  I made the modifications as others mentioned.  I added 2 tsp garlic pwd, salt & papper, 1/2 tsp Old Bay. I only used 2 cups of mozarella & added 1 cup of Ricotta, I made it in a 9x9 stoneware pan but used the full batch of sauce - it was too runny - next time will use less sauce by maybe 1/3.

Delicious, but better if you:
1)Cut the cheese down--it only needs 1-2 cups of mozzarella. Still cheesy and much healthier!
2)Saute 1/2 pound mushrooms and add them to the white sauce.
3)You can use crab substitute (surimi) in place of the crab, and cut both crab and shrimp by 1/2

Very tasty and easy to make. We substituted scallops for the crab because crab was too expensive this week. No-boil lasagna noodles worked fine. Will definitely make it again.

Wow!  I made this for my boyfriend because he loves shrimp and lasagna, and chose this recipe over another one with better ratings because the ingredients cost less.  I made this as the recipe described except doubled the sauce as someone recommended, used half the shrimp and (imitation) crab and mozzarella, and added spinach as one of the layers.  The sauce was bland as written but really something with salt, pepper, garlic powder and Emeril's Essence added.  Next time I'll just do 1 1/2 times the amount of sauce though because it overflowed in my oven :o(

My lasagna turned out pretty well, but I cheated. In reading the other reviews I was concerned that it may turn out rather bland. I'm not very good with adding seasonings and such, so I bought a mushroom alfredo sauce. I added the parmesan cheese to that, and layered everything accordingly.  I will probably make it this way again.

Great recipe!  I chose it because it had fewer ingredients than other recipes I saw.  I made it in 2 9x9 glass pans - cooked one, then froze the other.  I cooked it close to 40 minutes, and the top started to brown only 20 minutes in, so I covered it loosely with foil.  Next pan I will cook  less time - it was a little more firm than I would have liked.  I used full size shrimp, cut up, and a crab meat substitute.  The flavor was great - I don't feel like I need to add anything for our tastes.

Big hit with my husband and a good spin on lasagne.  I put spinach and broccoli as a layer before adding the cheese to add some more veggies to the dish.  Also I reduced the mozzerella to make more healthy.  Overall great dish!

Loved this recipe but can't do 5 stars only because I changed it up a bit.  I incresed the sauce by 1 cup and added old bay, oregano and garlic powder. I also added some mushrooms to the sauce. I added a layer of spinach just for some green and used imitation crab (only because I had some on hand from a sushi making party the night before); it would be much better with regular crab.  That being said, everyone LOVED this.  MY husband and fatherinlaw each had 2 huge servings and even my 18 month old lapped it up! I will definitely be making again!

I only put in 1 cup of milk so it wouldn't be soupy. As for cheese, I combined 1 c. ricotta cheese, 1 c. mozzarella, and an egg. I also added spinach, garlic, basil, and parsley. My dad and my husband loved it!

Okay I really liked the concept of seafood lasagna, but I tweaked this recipe a LOT so I couldn't give it a 5 without the caveat that I tweaked, so your mileage may vary.

Instead of 5 cups of mozzarella, I subbed in 1 C of ricotta, and 1 C of fat free cottage cheese. I mixed that and an egg in with the shrimp and crab and used that as my filling. 
I added garlic salt to the sauce - I should have added more, but I like a lot of garlic.
I was only able to fit the bottom layer, and 2 more layers of noodles in my pan, since apparently I like my inside layers pretty thick.
If I make this again, I'll double the recipe for the inside and sauce, and make two, one for now and one for the freezer!

Incredible.  Incredibly rich, though.  Remembered one reviewer who said they were a big eater but this is RICH.  They are right.  That doesn't mean it isn't good, it's the BEST seafood lasagna recipe I've ever tried.

Did the version that is seafood on bottom layer, ricotta egg and 1 TBSP Old Bay in middle layer and seafood on top.

Putting the Old Bay in the white sauce also helps what is already a good recipe.

You're doing it now, but do yourself a favor and READ THE REVIEWS.  They are very helpful.

The only thing I will change is perhaps make a smaller one next time.  For 2 people it may be just a little too much

I just made this for Christmas Eve.  Didn't have salad shrimp so I cooked some large frozen shrimps and just diced them up.  (Took about 1.5 pounds raw shrimp to give me a pound, cooked).  Also used the large can of refrigerated lump crab meat from Costco.  Added fresh minced garlic and a few shakes of cayenne to the butter while making the sauce.  My family really enjoyed it.

very rich, creamy lasagna. different but good. you should be a creamy sauce/alfredo fan to really enjoy this which i am not- but my bf is. we used crab, shrimp, and scallops. added spinach, layer of ricotta mixed with an egg, old bay, and some parsley. had to add a bit more flour to thicken up the  sauce. overall a great dish with an interesting flavor.

I did not care for this recipe.  It may have been better had I taken the recommendations to double the sauce, but honestly, I doubt that could have saved it.

This lasagna was great! I used the advice of the other reviewers (like Pasadenso) and made small changes such as more sauce, ricotta cheese, and 1 1/2 tsp of Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning (couldn't find Old Bay) Everyone who tried it wanted seconds!  My friend wants me to bring it for part of her family's Christmas Eve dinner.

Wonderful, mouth watering, recipe.  I am not crazy about seafood but this was excellent.  My husband and I literally fought over who was going to make it!  Great with scallops added also.  Served it at a dinner with family and everyone loved it.  Great with cheese bread and a side salad!  Hats off to Jeanette!!!

This was a decent recipe. I made as-is, except adding garlic, onion, salt, and pepper to the sauce and ricotta cheese to the layers, but the next time I make this I will change a few things. I didn't think the crab went too well in the dish, next time I'll leave it out and add two pounds shrimp, or the one pound shrimp and the same amount of scallops. The sauce turned out a bit more "grainy" than I am used to, so I plan to take the sauce from the White Cheese Chicken Lasagna recipe on this site, leave out the herbs, and use that with only two cups cheese. I agree with the other reviewer's that you can easily add less  shredded cheese. Thanks for sharing.

Very good!  Added 15oz ricotta cheese and some garlic powder to the cream sauce.  Would add a can of spinach next time, and maybe some pepper and Old Bay seasoning.

My boyfriend and I made this for some friends this past weekend and they loved it. Unfortunately I did not read the reviews before I made it. I agree with the consensus the sauce was not really enough and it was slightly bland. A little garlic would have made it better.  Our guests were very impressed though.

This was very good, but it was so very rich.  I could only manage to eat a small piece, and I am a big eater. I did add garlic to it, which added some good flavor.

Sounded bland, so I sautéed some garlic and added chopped large prawns to it, sprinkled ground ginger powder in and when opaque, put aside. Sautéed 1 medium onion (chopped) until soft, added crabmeat, added the juice from the cooling sautéed prawns, and put aside. Sautéed garlic with some sliced mushrooms. Used a bit of oil with all, salt to taste in some, keeping in mind of the cheese later. Made extra white sauce; sprinkled dashes of nutmeg, ground pepper and hot chilli powder in it, and spread between all layers, in regards to some comments of it being quite dry. Chopped some fresh tomatoes and sprinkled between middle layers and on top. Looked fabulous with tomatoes peeking out melted cheese and sauce, and was done in about 50 minutes 180C, scrumptious! Good base recipe, love it. Thanks Jeanette.

I think the shrimp tainted it for me.  I would use either all crab or medium or large shrimp chopped instead of the smaller shrimp if I were to make it again.

Made this recipe for a family dinner and everyone loved it!  We used crawfish instead of shrimp and added the ricotta as recommended.  We also added some mushrooms. We seasoned the seafood mixture with some Zatarains Crab boil and put a little Tony Chachere's into the white sauce for added flavor.  This is a great recipe with wonderful flavor and I will be making this again soon!

Considering crab is my favorite food I was surprised that I did'nt like this. It tasted very bland. Considering how long this takes to prepare I won't attempt to try this again.

I am a beginner when it comes to cooking.  I always make my boyfriend try my cooking.  For the first time I think he was truly impressed.  It was so delicious..  Tasted like hard effort was put into it but was so easy.  I also added ricotta cheese which made it even better. Will definitly make again!

This was good, but was too dry.  Next time I'll add the sauce to the seafood layers, not just on top.  I think it would be good with spinach and mushrooms, as well.

We just had a family reunion where there were 4 different lasagnas.  Once word got around about the seafood lasagna, it was the first one to disappear!  It was so easy to make and very tasty, definitely a nice change from the traditional meat lasagna.

Made this for our big family Lasagna Night and it went well. My kids LOVED it.  I took the advice of other reviews and added some garlic and spice (cayenne) to the sauce. Also mixed 2c ricotta and 2c mozza for the cheese filling. And because I'm huge pesto fan, I added that to the cheese filling as well.  Obviously the nice thing about this recipe is you can adjust it to your taste. Will be making again for sure.

Was fabulous!  A little rich but delicious.  Great dish for company.  As others suggested added 1 cup ricotta cheese and a layer of spinach (mostly for colour).  Will definitely make again.  Thank you.White Rock, British Columbia

I was not too impressed with this recipe. It seemed very dry.  I added some garlic and other seasonings as others stated. Will probably try it again but next time I am going to use Alfredo sauce and cottage cheese and "build it" like a regular lasagna to simplify the recipe and make it my own. I also thought it would be better with just crab instead of the shrimp/crab combination.

I made this recipe last night for dinner for tonight. At lunch today I could not help myself & had to give it a try! I thought it was really good!! I made some changes to mine that I wanted to note. The only "seafood" used was imitation crab (one family member is allergic to shellfish but misses it!) I also added some spinach and diced tomatoes to the ricotta mixure. I used regular mushrooms since I had them. The shredded cheese was a Colby Jack/Mozerella mix which gave it some color along with the tomatoes & spinach. It turned out absolutly beautiful! If anything it may be a little bland in flavor, but it's nothing a little additional seasoning or a dash of hot sauce before you eat it, can not fix! Overall I love it & wil make it again! Thanks for the recipe!!

Two words; Yum Yum! I added garlic cloves in the sauce when I made it which added a little zest and used less cheese. Only thing I wish I had done differently was double the sauce. It turned out a little dry because the noodles soaked up the sauce.  Even though dry it was delicious.  Will make it again!

I also added ingredients that others added like Old Bay, ricotta cheese and red peppers. It was just okay. I really wasn't that impressed with it like I thought I would be. My husband loved it but I don't think I will make it again. It does take a lot of time to make. I did find that my sauce didn't thicken up much until I added the parmesan cheese.

I tried this recipe out on Christmas Eve for the family.  They all liked it. I found the sauce a bit bland even after I added my own seasonings.  It was nice for a change but I probably won't make it again.

I made this for my daughter's 8th birthday party.  Everyone loved it even the kids. Great recipe.  I added sauce between the layers to make it a little moister.

this recipe is quite good.......a good alternative to traditional lasagna for seafood lovers. I also added a layer of ricotta.

This recipe is definitely a winner.  I make it for company often.  I am very concious of fat intake and reduced the cheese to 3 cups.  It was plenty of cheese.  I also added 1 Tablespoon of crushed red pepper to the sauce for a little spice.  As stated, it's great with garlic bread.
