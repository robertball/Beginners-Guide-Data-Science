I normally follow the recipe exactly the first time through but this time I was having company and I wanted it to be beautiful. I not only doubled the raspberry filling, but I cooked the berries on top of the stove with sugar, cornstarch and a raspberry liqeuer. This way the cake presented well and didn't get soggy with berry juice. Good cake Roz.

This was a fantastic, rich, gooey cake that had every chocolate lover happy.  I made this cake for a friend's birthday and now everyone wants me to make their cakes from now on.  Thanks for the recipe!  DELICIOUS!

**If you don't like dark chocolate, I would suggest using more of the semi-sweet to milk-chocolate squares instead.  It was a little too rich for me, but everyone else loved it.  Also, I used buttercream frosting instead of the frosting listed.  It gave me more room for creativity and evened out the bitterness in the chocolate.  For the raspberry filling, I cooked it with raspberry liquor, doubled the raspberries, raspberry preserves (seedless), and a little cornstarch to make it more of a gel.  I filled the cake and then used the rest for the the top.

This cake was pretty awesome. A tad bitter for my taste, but anyone that likes chocolate would love this. I couldn't swallow it without milk.  
The baking time is too much. The batter is very thick and brownie like, and so I checked it every 5 mins after 25 mins of baking. A lot of people wrote that the cake was too crumbly. That might be because it was over baked, or maybe the eggs weren't beat enough. I had to beat my eggs by hand.  Also, the filling was too little.  4oz is just not enough. I had 6 oz of raspberries. For every ounce of raspberry, i added .75 oz jam. If some people want the cake to be sweeter, strawberry would probably work.

And the frosting. Some people said it was too thick, that might be because the cream was boiled too long. And if it was too liquidy, maybe it needed to cool more. 

My cake looked so pretty that I didn't feel like eating it. hehe. And as the title says, the cake IS very fudgy...

This cake is inferior to most I have had. The raspberry filling is lovely, but use that idea with a better cake recipe. The cake comes out with a dry texture and a remarkably plain taste -- frankly the plain chocolate you use in the recipe tastes better than the cake. In addition it's a lot of fat for so little flavor. Furthermore, preparation is quite hard, especially folding the egg whites into the very heavy chocolate-laden batter. I do not recommend this recipe.

There are other cakes out there that are easier to "deal with" and just as tasty, but if you want to give this cake a try here are a few things that I learned.  1) When whipping your egg whites add your sugar at the very end.  Your whites will form the soft peaks better when there is no sugar. 2) Frost the top of your top layer before assembling.  The raspberry filling oozes out - EVERYWHERE.  3)  If you want A LOT of raspberry filling (like I did) I found out that by making three layers I could make holes in the middle layer by using a small biscuit cutter (about the size of a quarter).  The holes held the filling and the "leftovers" make great bite-size cakes.  4) Make extra frosting.  Because of the egg white/meringue added to the batter the cake is crumbly (not dry)therefore making the cake very hard to frost.  With the frosting in liquid form spoon/pour small amount on the cake - spreading gently. You want the frosting to absorb into the cake - you'll have an ugly 1st layer.  Allow the frosting to cool; on the cake and the remaining amount in the bowl (do not put the frosting in the fridge it gets too hard).  Once the frosting no longer drips off your frosting apparatus you are ready for layer two.  HOPE THIS HELPS!

7/27/01  I am a chocoholic and love raspberries, so for my 40th birthday when my husband asked what cake I'd like, I suggested this one.  It is the best cake I've ever put in my mouth.  My 2l year old daughter says she wants it for her birthday .  My younger children thought it was too much chocolate.  If you love chocolate, you'll love this cake.

THIS IS AMAZING!  If you are looking for the most delicious cake in the world, stop right here.  I made this for my high school graduation and it definitely eclipsed me as the main event.  Worth every penny and every second.  Delicious, beautiful.  My entire family adored it and I'm sure I'll be making it in the future.  I also used fresh raspberries, which I soaked in Grand Marnier overnight.  Consider upping the amount of filling, but superb the way it is.  I wish I could give it more stars.

Cake is excellent and worth the effort to make.  Very rich and chocolatey.  I increased amount of raspberry filling - thought it should have more.

This is the best Chocolate Cake I have ever made! It is more like a torte' than a cake. I made it a year ago this Christmas for a friends party and from now on it will be a tradition for me to make it every year or on very special occasions. I loved it and I also received rave reviews from the guests at the party.

This cake wasn't very "pretty", But it sure did taste good! I made it for Valentine's Dinner and I decorated the top with fresh raspberries in the shape of a heart. I was very worried about the bitterness of the frosting while I was making it, But it was a heavenly cake while being consumed!!! Will make again for special occasions!

I made this cake for a friends birthday, and everyone loved it!  I followed one of the previous suggestions and changed the filling.  Here is the recipe that I used:  1 1/2 cups frozen raspberries 2 tablespoons lemon juice 1/4 cup sugar 3-4 tablespoons raspberry liquor 1 tablespoon cornstarch   Mixed everything together and bring to a boil. While cooking, break up the raspberries with a fork.  Once it has boiled, set it aside to cool.  It makes a nice tart filling for this scrumptious brownie like cake.    I will definitely make this cake again!

This was fabulous! I followed the suggestions of other commenters and made more filling than the recipe calls for. I used 1/4 cup jam, 6 oz frozen raspberries, and a few tablespoons powdered sugar. It turned out beautifully; thank you for sharing this recipe!

This cake has a smooth, dense, and crumbly texture as opposed to a springy box-cake texture. It's the kind of cake that makes you want to close your eyes and savor it slowly. Very deep chocolate balanced nicely with raspberry.

i only made the cake part (made my rendition of the raspberry filling then topped it with white chocolate-mascarpone frosting....mmmm....) and it was very good!!!! heavy, dense and brownie like, but in a good way. at first it tasted best when (after being refrigerated) lest at room temp for about 10 minutes to soften up. HOWEVER!!!! after 2 days of being in the fridge the cake transformed itself into this incredible truffle-like consistency that was to die for! it may have been the filling seeping it, it may have just been the cake and chocolate mellowing out. i don't know. but if i were to make this again, i would definitely do it a couple days before i intend to serve it for maximum deliciousness! (forgot to mention, i followed the cake recipe to the T. didn't change a thing)

DELICIOUS, rich, dense chocolate experience!  Didn't have any chocolate squares so substituted 2 cups(!) cocoa and 1/2 c butter, substituted 1 c plain yogurt for 1 c butter, and used gluten free flour (as I'm celiac).  This is HEAVEN. Made own strawberry puree thickened w/ cornstarch and creamcheese frosting.  AMAZING, thank you Roz!!!!  Tastes like heaven!!

Honestly, this cake tastes like something you would pay $6 a slice for in a fancy restaurant. Though there is a process to this cake, it is relatively easy if you have done any baking. I also think that adding more filling is a good idea. I will be making this again and again.

Oh. My. God.  This cake is so good you may never make another.  Now I am talking about the CAKE part.  I did not follow the filling (I simply used raspberry jam, rather than jam and fresh raspberries) and to balance the dense chocolate I used a vanilla buttercream icing.  I also used only semi-sweet chocolate (as that is all I had) but I followed the procedure EXACTLY.  It does dirty a lot of dishes, but the result is an intense, chocolatey cake that is not too heavy (thanks to the egg whites) and is lovely.  A crust will form on top, but no worries - that will be quickly covered with filling or icing. If you are making this for a chocolate lover look NO further.  This is worth every minute it takes to make.

I made this for my brothers birthday Jan 30, 2008. I would not consider myself a "baker" or a "chef" however I tried this recipe, personally I was very thankful to have everyone's advise regarding the recipe. I followed the tips about baking time to be 10 less than recommended, I doubled the Raspberry's for the filling. The cake a a SMASH HIT!!!

It did however take at least 2 hours because I went step by step. You can multitask with the melting of the chocolate over the double boiler..that will save some time.

For my first time out of the gate...I have the bug.This recipe set the bar a bit high however now that I know I can create something this delictable, I want to experiment.

Thank you all for taking the time to let us know your little tips!!!
My own little tip (because I fell in love with the picture on the front..I used a frosting tip bag with home made whip cream....it was so easy and beautiful to look at)

This recipe was amazing! I made it for family and they all loved it. I didn't change a thing about it--it was VERY rich, just how I like it. If I were to change anything, I might add more raspberry filling next time, but it was great! :)

I had trouble with the cake. It cracked and crumpled when I moved it. I don't know if I did something wrong or if there's a trick... but it was still good to take the pieces, dip it in the raspberry filling and chocolate icing (which is amazing). Tastes good, but I found it hard to work with...

Perfect for any chocolate lover! I doubled the filling, as recommended. It was a little crumbly, but this may have been due to overbaking. Would definitely make this again and again!

This cake is really good. I made the filling first and put it in the fridge so it would not be to thin to spread, which worked out perfect. I also only cooked for 35mins, and it was perfectly moist. Super rich, make sure and cut small servings.

I made this cake as is but exchanged the frosting for a buttercream frosting instead.  My husband says that I should have just used the called for frosting because it was just too much with what I made.  I was following another reviewer's suggestion.  With how I did it, I just wasn't impressed with it. It was alright, but nothing fantastic.  Instead of using jam, I reserved the raspberry juice from when it was thawed and added some corn starch and heated it up.  The raspberries really made a nice contrast.  People just complained that it was too chocolatey. I have to agree.  Even just eating the cake (not the frosting) it is very chocolatey and rich. This cake MUST be eaten in very small pieces.  I won't make this one again because there are so many recipes out there that are better. If you do make it, use the frosting that is given...don't substitute and be ready for a chocolate overload!

I'm only rating the cake part.  It was amazing!  I put a strawberry cream frosting on it.  My wife would've preferred me to use the chocolate frosting.  I'm just afraid of too much chocolate.

For the cake batter, I used only 4 squares of unsweetened chocolate, and 8 squares of semi-sweet chocolate, because I was worried it would taste too bitter otherwise. It turned out great! 
The perfect balance of "dark" and sweet flavour.

The layers were a little delicate when I took them out of their pans after they cooled, and the top layer cracked in 3 places (which was covered-up with the berries after it was iced!)

The icing was still runny after being left at room temperature for about an hour, so it dripped down the sides of the cake a bit. But after refrigeration, it still looked pretty and smoothed out on top, despite the messy edges.

I used canned raspberry pie filling (E.D. Smith) between the cake layers, and decorated the top with fresh rasperries, blackberries, and white chocolate (Baker's).

It was a huge hit! Everyone loved it. :)

This cake is very good.  I used Baker's Chocolate both unsweetened and semi-sweet.  I didn't feel like buying raspberry preserves and frozen raspberries.  I used instead Raspberry Pie Filling - worked great!  I only used 1/2 of the can and then you can use the remainder for garnish on each serving.  I received many compliments.  As suggested by another reviewer - I forgot to refrigerate and did not die after eating some the next day...and the day after.... ; )

It ended up tasting ok, but a little dense.  However, I almost burnt up my electric hand mixer trying to mix.  I wouldn't attempt again w/o a stand up mixer.  And, the instructions are a little lacking for those of us who are new to baking.  I had a hard time with the egg whites.

This cake is wonderful and fluffy. Once when I made it, I got a drop of yolk in the whites. At the time, I was newer to baking and figured it was okay. It's not. The whites won't fluff and the cake will be flat. Be careful!

the icing is great, but the cake came out pretty dry.  maybe 45min is too long...?

tastes good, but we didn't like the texture, so we won't be making this again, except the icing.

This is a great chocolatey cake but more like a torte. It needs to be eaten in small slices. The only problem I had in the making of it was the chocolate immediately seized as soon as I added the beaten yolks.  The next time I made it I tried adding some of the chocolate to the yolks first then adding the yolks to the remaining chocolate and still it seized.  I just continued beating it with the remaining items then folded in the egg whites which loosened it up so at least it did become loose enough to spread but it is more of a brownie consistancy than a cake batter consistancy.  I put seedless raspberry jam in the center but made a chocolate dam around the edges of the cake to hold it in.   I frosted it entirely in a different chocolate frosting (the recipe from the Hersheys Unsweetened Chocolate Cocoa can) I then garnished it with raspberries and chocolate curls.

Delicious! My mother asked for this for her birthday. She absolutely loved it. It even pleased my boyfriends step mother, whom is a very picky eater. She couldn't stop picking at it. I followed  the directions for the most part. I used more raspberries and I also put the raspberry mix and a little cornstarch on the stove to get a nice thick gel as some other reviewers recommended.

My 12 y/o daughter made this for our anniversary this Summer. My husband says this was "the best cake he ever had!" We live in Europe and have travelled extensively. He's quite 'the food snob' and I've never heard him give such a compliment. She's making it again for a social gathering on Friday.

I was a little skeptical about making this because of some of the reviews but I am so glad I did.  I made it for my dad's birthday. My dad is usually a quiet man but he wouldn't stop talking about how good the cake was.  High end restaurant quality he said.  I followed the recipe exactly except reducing the baking time by 10min. and doubling the filling. Thank you for this amazing recipe!!

I was looking for just a chocolate cake recipe that didn't require cocoa powder (I didn't have any)and came upon this one.  I didn't have any unsweetened chocolate, so I replaced it with semisweet chocolate and reduced the amount of sugar by 1/4 cup when beating it into the butter.  I also didn't have any rasberries or strawberries, so I used a buttercream frosting to top and fill the cake.  It turned out amazing! really moist and dense.  Don't freak out if your cake ends up with a crusty layer on the top just out of the oven, the rest of the cake is superb!

I followed the directions exactly, and it was enjoyed by all (household members then coworkers when I needed it be gone so I would not eat it all).

Next time I might try making it into three layers instead of two and doubling up on the rasberry filling.

I made this cake for my boyfriend's birthday and it turned out just WONDERFUL! I followed the recipe for the cake exactly and I did not have any problems mixing the ingredients, unlike other reviewers. The baking time, however should be reduced by at least 10 minutes. And for the filling I took the advice of another reviewer and cooked the raspberries with some raspberry liquor and cornstarch and I even drizzeled some liquor on the cake before filling it. The frosting was so easy to make and turned out to have the perfect consistency. I garnished the cake with freshly made whipped cream and fresh raspberries and it looked just beautiful. We kept the cake in the fridge for almost a week (there is only the two of us and it is a lot of cake for only two people) and it just got better every day! Yum yum yum. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe does take more time than a typical cake, but was well worth the effort! It received rave reviews from tough critics.  

The cake was rich and moist with a very nice texture.  I used valhrona bittersweet and sharfen berger for the unsweetend chocolate. I baked it the night prior to icing & filling.  

I doubled the raspberry filling (and used about 3/4 of the doubled amount).  I would think the original amount would not be enough to get a true raspberry taste.

When making the ganache I added about 2 TB of chambord at the end to enhance the raspberry flavor. After it had cooled, I spread a small amount of the icing on the cake center and didn't think it looked really elegant.  I instead used it as a filling on top of the raspberry between the layers. 

I make the "Creamy Chocolate Frosting" from this site to cover the top and sides and it was excellent! I garnished with fresh raspberries.   The cake was a big success and was tres yummy for a birthday party. Thanks Roz!

So I completely messed the directions up - I didn't whip the eggs up at all and it was too late to repair anything. However I just went with it and it turned out wonderful. I figured it would be a complicated and unforgiving recipe but even with my huge error it was good. Almost too rich but wonderful for chocolate lovers

We LOVE this cake.  We double or triple the raspberry filling.  We also add another ounce of chocolate into the frosting.  For the frosting we mix it with the electric mixer to make it a thicker frosting.  Don't over cook or else it becomes dry.  This is our go to cake when we need something special.

I really liked this cake recipe. I made it for a coworker's birthday and it was a big hit. I made a few revisions. Instead of using jam I found a recipe for raspberry filling that called for fresh raspberries, water, and cornstarch. Also, I added some strawberries to the filling.

This was more like a brownie than like cake.  It was really good, just really rich.  We didn't need a lot to be happy. I made triple the filling and used the leftover to top french toast the next morning.  I also cooked the filling and added a little corstarch to thicken it.

Superb! This "cake" is very rich and a sliver will satisfy. The consistency is that of a torte, not a cake. I served this to a group of people and received raves. One should note that it must be refrigerated. It was totally gourmet; thanks!!

I would give it 5 stars if the raspberry filling was doubled. The cake was fantastic! My husband's exact words were "restaurant quality."  I doubled the filling, added a teaspoon of cornstarch (for a more jell-like filling) and a couple of tablespoons of sugar (to add some extra sweetness, as this cake was for my 5 y/o's b-day) and heated over the stove top until it boiled for 1 minute. Then I let it cool completely before spreading on the bottom cake layer.

This was my first attempt at making a  cake from scratch and it was a complete success.  It is extremely rich and chocolately and delicious.  I did increase the amount of raspberries and preserves by quite a bit, but other than that followed the directions exactly.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made it for all the girls at my work and everyone loved it!! They all agreed if you don't like dark chocolate, you won't like this cake.  More for the rest of us!!  I took it out 10 minutes early so it was nice and moist,  I also added more raspberries and preserves for the filling.  Definitely will make it again!!

This cake was wonderful!! I wanted to bake something special for my family one night and this seemed to be a perfect recipe - but not too challenging. I baked the cake 10 mins less as others said and found it was very fugdy. It seems to be a nice special occasion cake and I would definitely make it again. Great recipe!!! I highly recommend it. Plus, I really impressed my parents with this chocolatey cake.

My husband was in the kitchen and watched me prepare this dark chocolate cake for his Backyard Barbecue Birthday party, so he appreciated the extra preparation. Dark chocolate lovers really took a shine to it and came back for seconds.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was beautiful to look at but too dry, too dense, and too much chocolate to the point of being kind of bitter.  My guests politely ate half their piece.  I will not make it again.

This cake was OK. Like some of the other reviewers, I found the cake to be very dry. I'm giving this two stars because although the cake was alright, it wasn't worth all the work.

I made this for Valentines Dinner. Followed the recipe exactly as it reads. ANd it came out very Blah. The cake was Extreamly dry, not moist like stated. I really expected a much lighter cake since there was very little flour and with the whipped egg whites. The filling was ok, but I would added a bit of sugar. The frosting is ok, a little on the bitterside, I love dark chocolate but my husband prefers a little sweet to his. The over all taste was, so/so. If you can get past the heavyness. I may try this again, but I will modify it a little.

This recipe is rather complex and it takes quite a bit of time to make.  The frosting is WONDERFUL!  However, the cake is quite dense and although I followed the recipe exactly the cake was drier than I expected.  It has potential to be quite good but I would cut the baking time by at least 7-10 minutes.

I used this recipe for the grooms cake at my wedding. I made a stacked 10" and 6" cake which took 3 recipes. I always bake a week ahead and freeze which worked fine with this cake. It is so fudgy and moist! I put a chocolate buttercream basketweave on the sides and topped with fresh raspberries on the top of each tier. Beautiful and delicious! I got a lot of compliments on it and some people have already asked me to make it for their upcoming occasions! You can only put so much of the filling in between the layers without it squishing out but it would be fine to make extra filling and drizzle it over the slices when you put them on the plate. Excellent recipe!

This was so dry! I was so dissapointed. Granted, I do not bake cakes often, but I tried this one for a special occasion and we ate 2 slices and I decided the rest wasnt worth the calories and threw it out! I followed the recipe exactly, I just thought it was very dry and not that tasty.

Ohmigosh!  Served this for Valentine's Day to my sweetie, and he fell even deeper in love with me!  It was beautiful!  I used fresh raspberries for the filling, and added a more preserves. I used fresh raspberries on the edge of the cake and it was a knockout! Had enough for 5 guests two nights later.  I made some whipped cream to top it off and it was even BETTER!  It was WORTH the effort.

I made the cake exactly as specified. Then, I used raspberry preserves for the middle layer and chocolate frosting made with confectionery sugar (rather than frosting recipe given) to top. I thought the cake was good overall. The raspberry added a lot. The downside was this cake was crumbly and kind of dry/brownie like. It wasn't the moist cake-like consistency I was hoping for. I probably won't make it again.

Made this cake for my husband's birthday party. As a chocolate lover, I thought it was awesome! I didn't have wax paper so thought I could use oil and flour- def didn't work! Turned into more of a molten cake. I tore up the pieces, added the layer of raspberry mix, topped with rest of torn pieces. I also didn't have enough semisweet chocolate for the frosting. I melted some truffles. Omg, chocolate heaven! Very rich!!! Only need a SMALL piece to be fully satisfied.

There is no need for icing on this cake or filler. I made 1 9" pan and served with fresh raspberries. It was the best chocolate cake I've ever had.... no need to gild the lily.

This recipe was ok, but not that delicious. It's more like a brownie cake rather than a traditional fluffy, moist cake, and it was a little too rich for my tastes. The filling was good but is overwhelmed by the intense chocolate brownie.

Amazing! This is the best chocolate cake I have ever had. It is rich, creamy, and delish. It is not fluffy like your typical cake, more like a tort. I followed the recipe for the most part. I am allergic to dairy, so I used Earth Balance instead of butter, and I made the frosting with whipped coconut cream, sweetened coco powder and just a touch of guar gum for thickening. I used more ingredients for the raspberry filling than the recipe called for and would have liked even more raspberry in the finished product. The cake was done baking in 35 minutes, so I agree with others to take it out before the 45 minutes that the recipe calls for. This cake is VERY rich and goes well with vanilla ice cream to help wash it down.

This was wonderful! I don't like cake, but when the reviews said that this is more like a torte, I had to make it. I made it for a co-worker's birthday, and with 5 people in the office, it was gone by the end of the day. I'll definitely be making this again.

This cake was delicious. I over folded the egg whites into the batter (which is totally my fault, and often a problem I have), but it just made the cake come out really fudgy instead of fluffy. It was wonderful and no one realized I made a mistake.

I'll admit, I did not use this cake recipe. I used "One Bowl Chocolate Cake III" recipe instead. I did use the raspberry filling and the frosting recipe though, and both of those went great with the One Bowl Chocolate Cake III that I made.

My friends loved this cake. I used cherry filling and needed to use more cream for the icing to cover it. It is important not to overcook it as it started to get a bit crumbly and I took it out 10 minutes early. Nice recipe.

Tastes incredible! I'm a true novice of cooking and baking and this was so worth the time!  I did take others advice and I took it out 10 minutes early and it was so nice and moist.  

I don't like the wax paper thing at the bottom- hard to take out-- I think I'd rather just put cooking spray. 

Also there is an error in the recipe.  It says to mix the chocolate with the egg whites so I assumed ALL egg whites (because it doesn't say how much to use).  I made that mistake and later realized there was more to do with the egg whites and sugar.  I just added a 1/4 more and it worked fine.

I used mixed berries w/ this and shaped it into a heart for Valentines day.

I ended up having to go with strawberry, but wow was this good! It was my first time making a cake (I think) not using a cake mix, but I did okay!

I made this cake for my birthday, it was quite time consuming but I enjoyed the moist fudgy texture so much.  I would highly recommend to others, but be careful not to over bake it drys out quickly.

A really great, rich chocolate cake! I made it without the raspberries as a one-layer 9x13 cake, and it was excellent this way, too.

So rich and fudgey!  I love this ganache, too--I use it for frosting a lot of other cakes, sometimes I whip it, sometimes I just pour it on.  Take the time to use a quality chocolate like Guittard or Ghiradelli and you'll really be nicely rewarded.

Excelent cake. Went over very well with everyone at work.

My only suggestion would be to add more raspberries for the filling. I followed the filling recipe exactly and didn't end up with a lot of raspberry flavor. Next time I am adding more frozen raspberries.

Very disappointing.  I had such high hopes for this recipe considering all the chocolate, cream and fruit.  After making the cakes and taking them out of the pan, one of them crumbled into a mess. Too bad since I was making it for a church fund raiser. I guess I will have to get a store bought one :(

I'm only giving this recipe 2 stars. I made a lot of different changes myself to this recipe. It wasn't really completely bad, it just wasn't what I was looking for. First off, I saw some people complaining about the cake batter being thick... well, yes... I mean, you're working with chocolate ;) lol... I won't make the cake batter again though. The cake itself was tasty, but there was a weird hard shell around it when it cooled. If you like to decorate your cakes like I do, then this isn't the cake you want. The filling was just way to sweetly tart to care for. And chocolate makes raspberries more tart. I only used semi sweet choc, dont care for anything else! The icing was way too drippy to spread. After having it in the fridge for about an hour it was still gooey, so I made it into a chocolate buttercream... delish, probably the best part of the cake!! Well, besides my decoration ;) hahaa.. on that note... I probably won't make this cake again, just the frosting part.. but cootos to all of those that enjoyed it. My mom and sister loved it and it was for them, for mothers day today. I guess it was a success in that sense!!! Thanks for the recipe!

I was disappointed with this recipe.  The cake came out super dense, dry and the taste was very bland.  It has similar consistency to a flourless chocolate cake.  It also took a very long time to prepare.  In the future I'll make the cake with a different recipe, but do the raspberry filling with the ganache-like frosting.

It's toooo rich. Not too sweet, but too fat and too chocolaty. Otherwise it tastes fine. Also, it's not a "cake", it's more like a fudge. I made it and only one friend liked it, and he has always liked super sweet or super rich dessert. I also doubled the rapsberry filling.

Although this is a tasty cake, it is way too dry and crumbled apart as it sat there in the pans cooling.  When I turned it out of the pans onto wire racks, it crumbled further.  I doubt I'll use this recipe again, as I followed the directions to a "T" and was disappointed.

I was really disappointed with this cake.  I chose it for the "Deep Chocolate" in the title and for the raspberry centre.  However, it was far from "deep" chocolate (very pale in colour, and I found the texture very crumbly/crispy on top due to whipping the egg whites.  I was so disappointed that I never even bothered to ice or filli it, so I can't comment on that part.  Not sure if it was because the oven temperature was too low and it didn't cook fast enough or what happened, but I think I will stick with a couple of the other great recipes for chocolate cake I have found on here.  Glad it worked out for some others!  ;)  Lorrie

Tasted good but looked awful.  (My husband actually burst out laughing when he saw it thinking it was a joke) I had my mom make this for my birthday and I admit she doesn't give much thought of presentation but this wasn't her fault. She followed the recipe exactly and the cake turned out very dry, crumbly and impossible to frost. She ended up just pouring the frosting on top and letting it fall down the sides.  Looked like a bad science project.

Wonderful for 'Chocoholics'!  Quite expensive to make, not an 'everyday' type of dessert.  Quite a bit of trouble to make, but good for special occasions. Chocolate is too intense for small children.

I did a test cake and the real cake because my office holiday party is a bake-off judged by professional chefs from our university's hotel program. It's serious business!  The test cake came out good but a little chalky if truth be told. I forgot to add vanilla to the batter. And some egg yolk got into the white. Plus I don't think I beat the whites till they really peaked.  

Tonight I was very careful and used an electric hand mixer to beat the egg whites (no yolks fell into them). They got nice fluffy peaks. Remembered the vanilla. 

This time when I mixed the batter in the final stage, it was light and a bit fluffy - much easier to mix than yesterday's batter. It looks like it's baking more evenly and has a good rise while yesterday's was a tad flat.

I also realised from the test cake that there wasn't enough raspberry filling - just like everyone said. I did add about half a package more berries. Still, tonight I'm adding twice as much of everything and will spread it on thick. I did add a few teaspoons of corn starch to thicken it and that helped to make it easy to spread and not soak into the cake.  I've added raspberry liqueur.

Last but not least, I too found the frosting thin even after keeping it in the fridge for half an hour. So I'm treating it more like a glaze - a mirror glaze at that. If you make enough of it and pour it all over, it looks amazing. It's a shiny, deep chocolate brown. The fresh raspberries on top look like rubies. I used mint leaves to add a b

Just finished decorating this cake! The frosting was a bit soft and didn’t hold the peaks but it tasted good! It’s my husband’s birthday cake- he loves chocolate and raspberries. I didn’t frost the sides because it was a bit crumbly- but again it tasted good. Can’t wait to slice into it tomorrow!!

This chocolate cake was excellent. I made it for a going away party and it served 17 people with small slices. This cake is very rich, the first bite tastes like eating pure chocolate. The second bite tastes like chocolate and raspberry. And from there it just gets better. Very addicting!

I did not use unsweetened chocolate in the cake, I used bittersweet and semi-sweet.

I used 2 8" pans and the cooking time was well over an hour. The cake came out moist.

I refrigerated overnight before shaving and filling/icing.

The cake is amazing. Tons of compliments.

My whole family loved this recipe.  I've made it twice - once I added the 1/2 cup of sugar to the egg whites - once I left it out. The cake was just as wonderful.

I do double the filling.  The cake travels well ( 8 hours in a cooler to an out of state birthday party) and looks beautiful with a garnish of raspberries and a little whipped creme on the side.

The best cake ever!
I made it for a bday dinner and was a huge success! So decadent!
Improved a little, I traded the vanilla for almond extract and ¾ cup coffee and ¼ cup Starbucks raspberry syrup, and used only 1 cup coco for the frosting !!! Yummy!!!!

I baked the cake itself as directed, but I followed the advice of other posters who suggested making a more stable raspberry filling using cornstarch. I did not realize the cake layers weren't quite cool when I began trimming them to stack more neatly.  AS a result, the cake pretty much fell apart.  Instead of serving layer cake, I turned it into a chocolate raspberry trifle. The cake was still warm, though, so it sort of melded into a rich pudding.  It was delicious, whatever it turned out to be!

This is an extremely dense "cake". I actually had a comment that they weren't sure if they were eating fudge or cake. There is definitely no pouring the batter into cake pans or folding egg whites in. I actually had to push the batter into the pan to fill it. The filling and frosting need to be doubled. Not nearly enough of either. I ended up mixing the frosting with a batch of butter cream to minimize the dark chocolate flavor (the cake is already very dark chocolatey) and make enough to adequately cover the cake. A lot of people liked the flavor of the cake, but the texture leaves a lot to be desired. Probably won't make this again.

I followed the recipe and instruction exactly, except I used fresh raspberry for the filling.  No professional reason.  My store was out of frozen raspberry.  The cake came out dense and moist.  It turned out not too sweet, very elegant chocolate cake.  I'd say use very good quality chocolate.  A small piece satisfying me.  It takes a little work, but definitely worth it.  I would save this recipe for special occasion like someone's birthday or anniversary.

The cake turns out more like a brownie consistency but I loved it :) I made it for a friend's birthday and people adored the cake. Thank you!

This was the richest cake I ever made! It was LOVED by my family but it took hours and many mixing dishes. I would have given it 5 stars but there should have been a better option/directions on making a  raspberry filling from scratch. I also only baked it for 30 mins based on comments and the cake layers were perfect! The icing was super runny- I just dumped it on. It looked great anyway flowing all over and around the cake.
