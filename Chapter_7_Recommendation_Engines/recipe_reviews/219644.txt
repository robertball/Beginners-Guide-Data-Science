Good basic recipe but the seasonings definitely need to be altered if you prefer kick in your dinner. I practically tripled the Cajun seasoning and added the following: 1/2 t. gumbo file, Louisiana hot sauce to taste(~1T.) and red chili flakes to taste (~1/2t.). I omitted the celery salt (didn't have any on hand) and subbed in yellow and red bell peppers for the green and ground beef for the turkey. I also added a chopped tomato just to use up some produce. I can't wait to eat this tomorrow after the spices have really sunk in - mmm!

This was pretty good. I ended up doubling the cajun seasoning and adding 1/2 teaspoon of salt because it seemed bland.

I liked this, it created a perfect base to add whatever other seasonings and spices desired. Instead of the celery flakes, I put two stalks of celery in the food processor and chopped them very fine. I also used an entire onion and entire green bell pepper. I added salt, extra cajun seasoning, red pepper flakes, and a little cayenne. It tasted a lot like Zatarains.

Served this alongside Blackened Salmon Po' Boys found on another site.  I omitted the turkey and took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the cajun seasoning, but I thought it was just a bit too much.  1 1/2 tsp would probably be just about right for my tastes.  But then again, I'm not Cajun ;p  Also, be sure to use a good brand of Cajun seasoning.  Generic won't cut it here.  Anyway, my family LOVED it, and it disappeared almost as soon as it was on the table.

I sauteed chicken livers in some butter...then added the veggies - I used chopped celery instead of the flakes.  I ended up adding a bit of cayenne pepper...and it really turned out awesome!!

Loved this recipe for dirty rice. I chose it because it used ground turkey and I had some on hand. The only thing I changed was using about an 1" long piece of minced celery that I added to the meat when cooking the onion, pepper and garlic and that was because I could not find dried celery flakes at the store. Topped my bowl off with a couple dashes of Tobasco sauce and had a filling and delicious lunch. Used a Cajun seasoning mix off of this site (Cajun Spice Mix by Bobbie Jean) and know I'll make this again. Very adaptable recipe too! I can see using turkey sausage or adding diced tomato and/or beans. Great side dish or light meal. Thanks akatenacious3.

Yummy side for our Fat Tuesday work party. Our group liked that it was something different than the standard red beans and rice, and that it was something the South Beach dieters could enjoy as well. Added a small dab (probably an 1/8 cup) of leftover Chorizo I had in the fridge, it added a nice color and hint of spice.

WOW! what a simple, tasty, filling dish! Like some of the other reviews, I added tomatoes, kidney beans, and Cajun seasoning.  I don't typically measure ingredients for dishes like this. I'm doing Dr Oz's Two Week Rapid Weight Loss Diet and it calls for 6oz of lean meat (ground turkey breast) and 1/2 cup brown rice and unlimited amounts of certain selected low GI veggies...so this dish was perfect! And it was very filling.  Added a side of steamed broccoli for a full meal!  Thanks for sharing. I think I'll make it again a couple of times while on my 2week Dr Oz journey!  Thanks for sharing!

Very yummy! I followed the recipe almost exactly, but I doubled the turkey because I didn't want to save half a package. It was excellent as a main dish! Next time I am going to try it with diced tomatoes on top.

Way too bland when we followed the recipe (without meat for side dish). Added more seasonings and about 6-7 ounces tomato sauce for double recipe, gave it flavor w/o just tasting hot, like adding hot sauce etc.

Doubled the turkey to make more of a main dish.  Added some hot sauce and corn, but still a little bland.  Would use more seasoning next time.

Very good side dish. I did use a full pound of ground turkey because that was the size package I had, but it would have been fine with a half pound too. I recommend estimating ingredients based upon what your family likes - more or less spice, extra garlic, whatever you choose. I chopped a serrano to serve with mine because I'm the only big heat lover in the house.

I omitted the ground turkey and the minced garlic.  I tripled the recipe.  Except I didn't measure the bell pepper, I just used one red and one green.  If you triple this recipe, you end up with 3 tsp of Cajun seasoning.  That would be horribly bland.  I used a total of 4T.  Part of the reason is because instead of using ground turkey, I cooked about 3 pounds of boneless pork ribs in a crock pot with enough water to almost cover the meat, plus 2 T of Cajun seasoning.  When the pork was done cooking I cut it up into bite size pieces and added it to everything else.  This recipe says to add 1/3 cup of water once you have all the ingredients simmering together.  I added at least a cup.  Just eyeball it and see how it looks.  I don't like my dirty rice all soupy, but I wanted enough water to mix in all the seasoning.  This recipe is too bland as written, but it's a great starting point.  If you increase the Cajun seasoning as I did and it's too spicy for you or someone else, just add some sour cream.  It tones down the heat and tastes great.

I hate leaving a low rating, but at the same time I'm getting tired of seeing these high star ratings, then spending my time and money to prepare the dish, and having it be so bad my family wont even eat it. While everyones palate does vary, this dish is very bland. I doubled the cajun seasoning, but it was still bland. In stead of adding plain water, I added chicken broth - and that seamed to help. Then I served it with sour cream. But my family was disappointed (as was I) and asked me not to make the dish again. 

NOTE: I had a hard time masking the "turkey taste" with these seasonings. Maybe use ground chicken instead. And possibly add some flavorful sausage, such as Andouille... If it gets too spicy, a little sour cream will help.

We love this healthy version of dirty rice. I use instant brown rice instead of regular brown rice. We always make this with dried black beans cooked in the crock pot all day seasoned with cumin, chili powder, chicken broth, salt and pepper. PERFECT health meal!

I made this recipe for dinner, made a few changes added red pepper and actual diced celery instead of celery flake,and I doubled the portion. We ate it as a side dish for the first night along with some catfish and coleslaw. We ate it as a meal for lunch the second day and it was even better. The flavors melded together better on day two. I also used Tony Chachere seasoning for Cajun spice blend, THE BEST!

Excellent main/side dish.  I made a few changes.  I used turkey sausage.  Instead of using the Creole season, I used a combination of sage and hot sausage. I added roasted garlic to the mix.  What a great dish!!!

The only change I made was to add some hot sauce because I thought it needed a little kick.  It was a quick and easy dish to make and I will probably make it again.

This was delicious and quick. I followed the recipe as written with the exception of using a chopped celery rib as a replacement for the celery flakes, because that is what I had and I like to cook with as many fresh vegetables as possible.

I would have given 5 stars,  but I made several changes.   The base recipe was great.   I sauteed bell pepper, celery and onion in butter.  Next I added minced garlic.   I cooked my rice in chicken broth instead of water.   Instead of using ground turkey,  I used turkey sausage.   I wanted this spicy,  so I seasoned with cayenne pepper and gumbo file and regular seasonings I had on hand.

Tripled the recipe, used ground beef instead of turkey, celery instead of celery salt, and added canned diced tomatoes.

8.3.18 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/219644/kes-cajun-dirty-rice/ ... Yeah, changed things as I read reviews ... even with double the cajun spices, it didn't impress as cajun or anything worth the time or dishes/mess.

Made it for dinner last night and other than adding a can of fire roasted garlic tomatoes, no changes. It was sooooo good my husband wants the leftovers tonight! Serving it with cornbread from, naturally, allrecipes.com!

Add corn, black beans, chili powder, turmeric, paprika and red chili flakes. Double the cajan seasoning. Use red and green bell peppers. Add vegan  andouille sausage. It will probably need more salt.

I like this easy recipe for Dirty Rice because it's low fat, and made with brown rice. I use significantly more cajun seasoning, which I make myself so that I can control the salt and the heat.  This makes a regular appearance in our dinner rotation. I always make a double recipe for left overs, use fresh celery, and cook the rice in chicken broth. I serve it with a side vegetable and crusty bread.

Dont know what I was thinking...thought the recipe called for a can of tomatoes.  Glad I goof.  It turned out really nice.  Next time, and YES there will be a next time I will add a tbsp of chicken soup base to the meat mixture and a little more water.

Outstanding "base" for a quick and tasty Cajun rice recipe.
I also beefed up the seasonings. I added a touch more Cajun seasoning, instead of bell pepper I used just ain white onions, I added corn on the cob, and instead of turkey, I used sliced up sausage. I also added beef bouillion cubes to the rice to give it more dept in flavor. This is now a staple dish in out family. Props to whoever wrote this recipe. Thank you.
