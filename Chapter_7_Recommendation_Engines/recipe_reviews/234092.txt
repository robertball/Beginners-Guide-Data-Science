There are many recipes for brining, and many people do this each year.  I personally use this every year, that is why I submitted this recipe for review by allrecipes.com. Bottom line is, if your turkey was too salty, you most likely did not rinse the bird, or did not rinse it enough.  If you rinse it well after the brining you will not have the over saltiness.  You also do not need to add salt in the seasonings when cooking, which also would cause the issue you mention.  Try again with these things in mind.  Happy Brining!

This is the second year in a row I have used this brine. I will not cook a turkey any other way after having brined one for the first time last year.  I substituted a little this year depending on what I had in the pantry and fridge.  The turkey does cook faster after being brined so keep an eye on your bird!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I used this recipe this Thanksgiving. EASY!!! It didn't smell  all that great when I boiled it; but boy did this turkey come out GREAT!!! EVERYONE loved it. Moist,tender & VERY flavorful. I would probably also use an orange when baking.

This is the second year in a row we're using this brine.  Excellent flavor! We make some minor adjustments since we only need a very small turkey, but stay as close as we can to the original recipe.

Most amazing, beautiful turkey ever! The skin just wasn’t crispy, so I’ll try uncovering it for the last 20-30 min next time.
