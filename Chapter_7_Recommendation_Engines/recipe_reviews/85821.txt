I had some trouble with this recipe i did substitute the chicken broth with vegetable broth and also instead of ham i added a cup of broccoli.  But all of the cheese melted down to the bottom of the soup.  In the future I plan on substituting 1 cup of milk or cream for one cup of the broth and holding off on the addidtion of the cheeses until after the soup had been taken off of the heat

I was very pleased to find a way to use up my leftover scalloped potatoes! For a vegetarian soup I used vegetable stock and for added flavour I used a bit of thyme, sage and garlic powder. I added one bunch of broccoli flowerettes for colour. Oh, the "orange" bits in the soup are from the sweet potato I subbed into my original Scalloped Potatoes.

THIS SOUP IS REALLY GOOD.
IT IS A GOOD WAY TO USE UP THE
LEFTOVER POTATOES. IT IS REALLY 
CREAMY, AND WAS A REAL HIT.

I love soup and this was a good way to use up leftover scalloped potatoes.  Looking the recipe over again before I submitted my review I saw where CANUCKLEHEADMOM suggested using "Really Good Scalloped Potatoes."  My suggestion was going to be that the next time I try this soup I was going to add Cheddar Cheese Soup instead of the Cheddar cheese, but after looking up the recipe I see that cheese soup was used in the original recipe of "Really Good Scalloped Potatoes."  I think it would make good soup with any scalloped potatoes using a can of Cheddar Cheese Soup, and chicken broth.  I would only use garlic powder to taste.  As it says, "add, omit, experiment!"  Thank you CANUCKLEHEADMOM for the idea of making soup out of leftover scalloped potatoes.

Excellent. I've made this with a couple different potato based casseroles and they have all been very tasty. Some stuff I have added: sour cream, soy sauce, cream cheese, artichoke hearts, leeks, onions, milk (never all together). What a great way to renew tired leftovers.

We made this 3/31/2012. It is unbelievably good and we will make this again for sure!  We used Cheesy Scalloped Potatoes. We made a couple of changes to the original recipe. We used 3 cups low sodium chicken broth instead of 4 cups and in lieu of that added a cup of light half n half. We had some leftover ham, so that was easy to cut up and add. But we also added 1/2 cup finely chopped celery and 1/2 cup finely chopped onion. We made it just like the recipe said, but we did not add the half and half until AFTER the soup came to a boil (did not want to curdle the milk). We added the half n' half along with the Parmesan Cheese and Shredded Cheddar Cheese. This soup is low-cost, delicious, and you could use either left over scalloped potatoes or do like we did and make the box of scalloped potatoes up fresh and use it right away. The scalloped potatoes in a box were only 98 cents, so it's easy on the pocketbook. We loved this soup so much, while we were eating we said, Let's take some to our neighbors, so we did. They kept thanking us over and over. They had bad colds, and we figured since this soup has chicken broth in it, it might help them.

I used my own leftover scalloped potato dish, which already had a large amount of sharp cheddar in it, so I didn't add any more cheese to this soup.  I even cooled the soup and skimmed off the fat that had formed at the top, to make it a less fattening, but still a tasty soup.  The garlic powder is what makes this a terrific soup.

I added carrots, onion, and celery to this.  I used less broth and at the end added milk when I added the cheese.  (left out the ham).  I didn't think my husband would eat it.  He doesn't like scalloped potatoes.  He liked it so much that he wants me to make it again.

Modified slightly as I had no left over scalloped potatoes but wanted to try to soup anyway. I used the box mixes boiling the potato slices as you normally would but used chicken broth and butter rather then just water. I added all the things on the list in the recipe as well as the cheese packets from the box mixes and some extra broth to make it a little bit more soupy. I did add extra garlic, some onion powder, a dash of cayenne, and some extra black pepper. I added a little pour of heavy cream as well to make it a bit more creamy as well as a couple of pouches of instant potatoes that needed to be used i think sour cream and onion flavor and a 4 cheese to extend out the soup a bit more cause there was a large number of people to feed that day. Everyone enjoyed this, saved me the annoying potato peeling for my usual potato soup for a a bunch of people. I just made sure to watch it closely and add in more broth as needed. Great way to use up your left over ham or even use up a small pouch of ham chunks or ham steak from the grocery . Who doesn't love soups and stews on cold days? I will definately be making this again for us but on a much smaller scale then last time seeing as it would take us at least a week to eat a giant stock pot of soup that we ended up with. Sent leftover soup home with our kids that were visiting and when asked directed my daughter and daughter in law to the page for the recipe. Thank you for a great time saver. We love potato soup but I hate all tha

I didn't put the cheddar or parm cheese in as my scalloped potatoes had a lot in them already. So so good

It was easy to make and very good tasting.    Normally, my husband will say it's okay, if I ask him if he liked it.  This time he liked it and he said that is was really good.  Thanks so much for sharing the recipe.

I'm not sure if it was my scalloped potatoes, the ham I used (leftover ham steak), or the broth I used but the soup was quite salty. Other than that, it came out great and is easy to add or subtract ingredients to suit individual taste.

Very tasty. Super easy to make. I might puree next time.
