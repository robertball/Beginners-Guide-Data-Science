I made this twice and both times it was gone in a day. I did change some things both time I made it 1. used 1/4 almond extract & 3/4 vanilla 2. added 1/2 tsp cinnamon & 1/4 tsp ground clove to the batter 3. made the streusel topping w/ 1/2 tsp cinnamon(from earlier reviewer).
One version was with walnuts, second was with sliced almonds. Both were good, not to sweet or tart, but the almond version was much better.

This is the best cranberry dish I've ever made. I made it with a brown sugar/walnut topping (1/4 cup walnuts, 1/3 cup brown sugar, 2 tablespoons butter, 2 tablespoons flour mixed together), which definitely helped it, although it'd be good without the topping as well. I actually like it better cold than warm, but I generally like pies cold.

PROS: A mix and dump pie that makes its own crust, nothing could be easier. Without exception, everyone liked it - even those picky eaters who wouldn't touch my homemade Cranberry Chutney - and some took home a piece for later.   CONS: The 1 tea. of almond extract would have been overpowering for my taste. I took the suggestion of another reviewer and used 1/4 tea. of almond extract and 3/4 tea. of vanilla. That was perfect with enough of an almond taste that other bakers could identify it in the pie.   SUGGESTION: After you pat the mixture in the pan, take a handful or so of cranberries and scatter them on top, pushing them gently about half way into the batter. Some will burst and run while cooking, giving the pie a more festive presentation with more red on top in lieu of a lot of the white batter showing on top.

Oh wow!!  What a sweet surprise!!  This was SO GOOD!  It was yummy cranberry goodness surrounded by a tasty, tasty cake-thing.  I would describe the texture of the "cake" as a cross between a cake and a brownie (non-chocolate, of course).  I think the almond flavoring really ties it all together, and the nuts are essential too.  As I usually do, I used 1/2 cup whole wheat pastry flour in place of the white.  My husband was really blown away by this; he wasn't looking forward to "cranberry pie" but said it was one of the best things he's ever had!

I searched for this recipe since I had lost mine.  I love it!  It is easier to make, however, if you just put the cranberries and nuts in the prepared pan and pour the batter over them.  Glad I found your website and this recipe again.

Outstanding exactly as written. You can reduce the berries to 1.5 cups if you're really not fond of tartness or if your berries aren't quite ripe. Leave everything else the same. I have always used frozen cranberries (not defrosted) and had no problems, but yes, the batter is very thick. It isn't a pie, but a sort of torte made in a pie dish. Don't do the cinnamon or strudel topping thing, it doesn't go with the almond flavor at all, and the almond flavor is the whole point of this dessert, which has the wonderful consistency of a (non-chocolate) brownie. If you like the flavor of marzipan then you will love this dessert. And honestly, can people stop giving negative reviews to recipes they did not even make? If you made this with blueberries and lemon extract and Egg Beaters, then you can't say the recipe is bad! You did not make the recipe!!!

I love this recipe and you can make it in an 8x8" square pan without altering anything.  I used 100% whole wheat pastry flour and I added a streusle topping, before baking.  Enjoy!

Love this pie!  Totally different from anything that I have ever made/eaten!  Beautiful presentation with the contrast of red & white.  I even lowered the calories by using half splenda for the sugar, and it was delicious.  I plan to try this with blueberries - may add a little lemon zest with this version.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a great recipe - very easy and full of flavor. My husband and children loved it and asked me to make it again soon. The only change I made was to add 1 teaspoon of orange extract (because I was lazy and didn't feel like grating orange peel). It was the perfect blend of sweet and tart. I especially liked the fine sugar crust that formed on the top. To save time and use fewer dishes, I put the stick of butter in the pie plate to melt while the oven preheated. I took it out just before it had all melted and used a fork to rub the rest of the butter on the sides of the pie plate before pouring it into the mixing bowl. Thanks so much for a great recipe!

This was absolutely delicious! It ended up needing about 5 more minutes in the oven, but afterwards it was awesome:) Everyone who ate it just loved it, and it's so simple to make!

I made this twice, first with fresh cranberries, and it was odd in a very good way, and the second time I made it with frozen cranberries and it was a disaster. First, the cranberries unmelted my butter, and I had to microwave the whole thing, which didn't work too well. Then it wouldn't bake. When I took it out it was cooked on the top, but mushy in the middle. I put it in for another 15 minutes, with no change in the results.

My fiance's favorite! I used 1/2 teaspoon almond extract and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract as well as 1 teaspoon orange juice and a little zest of orange peel. As per other reviewer, I made it with a brown sugar/walnut topping (1/4 cup walnuts, 1/3 cup brown sugar, 2 tablespoons butter, 2 tablespoons flour mixed together)

Oh my word this was fantastic and easy! Always looking to eliminate hydrogenated fats (e.g. pastry). I am also looking for new recipes for the rhubarb that grows like a weed in my yard. Substitute the cranberry with rhubarb and you won't be disappointed. Almond extract and walnuts were a perfect pairing. More cake like than pie filling but reminded me of one of my favorite desserts...almond tarts!

This is one great baked good!  I don't really consider it a pie, but as a moist cake goes, it's wonderful and worth trying.  It's not very sweet - a nice change from the typical holiday dessert fare.  I use it as a breakfast coffee cake for my B&B - everyone loves it.  I have now made it a few ways, the recipe as written is wonderful.  I have now tried it with 2/3 cup of applesauce in place of the butter and it was equally as good.

This was really nice. I substituted pineapple for the cranberries since cranberries are not available where I live and cashewnuts for the walnuts. Sprinkled top with desiccated coconut before baking.Everything else I kept exactly the same. Once baked I drizzles with pineapple syrup while warm and allowed it to cool then I topped with cream whipped with a little sugar  and a few drops of almond essence then chilled till serving. This is a really good recipe. It is dense nutty cake with a really awesome flavour.. It is very good if you need a good dessert fast.

So simple and so delicious!! I followed the recipe exactly, except I used vanilla extract, instead of almond extract. . . Tis gone. Tomorrow I am going to bake it in my cast iron skillet. Pre-heat the skillet and melt 1/4 c. butter in the skillet before adding the dough (for it is more a dough than a batter, very thick, just spread it over your prepared pan). So, so good!! I'm sure the struessel is good, but as it this is a stellar recipe. Thanks!! UPDATE; Something I discovered by accident, if you first coat the cranberries in the sugar and then mix it all up, the sweet is right next to the tangy :) It also DID work in my skillet, only I used 1/3 c. in the batter and the remaining butter in the pan and I like it baked a little longer in the skillet for a true  cookie crunch! :)

This was so easy to make and a perfect balance of sweetness against the tart cranberries. I did alter the recipe a bit. Because I wanted to make two pies from one bag of cranberries, I used only 1 1/2 cups of berries and added an additional 1/4 cup of sugar. I baked it in a tart pan with a removable bottom. Very tasty!

This is a thin cake, not a pie.  The flavor is excellent, but it is incredibly tart, even for someone who enjoys a sharp cranberry sauce.  The butter, sugar and walnuts do not cut the tartness much.  I wish someone had mentioned reducing the fruit to 1 cup the first time it is made and then later increasing that amount to suit individual taste, it would have saved digging around the fruit for the cake.

I love this!! It's excellent!! I did make several of the suggested changes.  I agree this is more like a coffeecake, the dough is similar to a cookie in thickness.  I added 1/2 t of cinnamon and the struesel topping that was suggested. I reduced the cranberrys from 2 to 1 1/2 cups, and rised them in warm water to bring them to room temp prior to mixing in. And I measured a little generously on the sugar to appeal to a wider audience.  I made an extra half recipe and made it in a springform pan, I probably could have fit a double batch in it.  Took a little longer than stated to get done, was less than firm when I took it out but it set up nicely.  It tasted like a thick cranberry walnut cookie bar.  I thought it was the best dessert there.  Everyone at work loved it and asked for the recipe!!

Have done in pie plate and now as muffins.  I got 10 standard size out of this. Alum muffin papers would be best choice as after they cool they really stick to regular papers so need to be removed from papers while still warmish.  I did heaping 1/4 t. almond and scant 3/4 vanilla. With cranberry season coming up I recommend stockpiling several  bags  for the freezer so this recipe can be enjoyed year round. Edit: zested a large orange into batter, even better!

I made this for a work event, so I tripled the recipe. This comes out more like a cranberry cake, but it is moist and delicious.I tripled the recipe and I used one teaspoon of Almond, and two teaspoons of Vanilla-I think that was the perfect combination. I also substituted sliced almonds for the walnuts.  I baked it in a 9x13 pan and it took about an hour as opposed to 40 minutes. I sprinkled sugar on the top prior to baking and it gave it a crunchy sugary topping.  I cant wait to make this again, Ill be making it at thanksgiving and probably christmas as well! In fact I have extra bag of cranberries, I might make one tonight! This one is a winner!

I did not care for this recipe. Followed the recipe exactly.  I should have known, since it doesn't call for any levening agent such as baking powder, that it would be very dense and dry.  The flavor was just tart cranberries in dense almond bread.  My family was not impressed.

Super easy to throw together and super yummy!  I would call it more of a cake than a pie but whatever you call it, it is tasty!  I made it just as the recipe says.  I considered adding some spices to it but I didn't want anything to overpower or interfere with the almond extract.  That almond flavor goes so well with the cranberries.

SO GOOD - AND EASY! This is not a pie, at all. But it is the best CAKE in the world! I DOUBLE  the recipe and add more Walnuts. Bake in your regular cake pan. Delish! So pretty for the Holidays!

This is easy, delicious and looks beautiful. Thanks so much!  I didn't have any almond extract and just used vanilla and it was excellent.  The second time I made it, I used almond extract and added about 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of orange zest and it was outstanding!

Deliciously tart and tangy.  I reduced the butter by half and the sugar a little and baked it in an 8x8 pan. It only needed  need 30 minutes in the convection oven. (Pie is a misnomer- it is a cake with no leavening!) I ended putting 2 Tbs of turbinado sugar on top for a crunchy finish.  It is perfect.  My picky 16 y/o deemed it "Craisen Amazin'" whatever that means and had 3 pieces.  I hope there are still cranberries in the market b/c I want to make this again soon.  I might add more almond extract and some dried cherries or try adding a few diced dates.

This was the tastiest, super-simple dessert ever. I wouldn't change a thing, as there is a wonderful sweet-tart contrast as well as a crunch with the nuts. Baked perfectly in the time given, with a beautiful golden crust. I'm being begged to make another immediately at home, so I guess I'll make more to take to friends. Coffee + this = heaven

I made this pie for dessert today but.. it smelled soo delicious that I just had to sneak a slice! Yum!  Since I have a dairy allergy I used dairy free margarine plus I exchanged almonds for the walnuts as others had done (I kept some out of the batter to scatter across the top) and subbed Amaretto Disaronno for the almond extract. I then decided a glaze would send it over the top so I mixed 1/2 cup 10x sugar with enough Amaretto to to make it "drizzleable". Thanks for the recipe ... it is now in my "go to" recipe box!!!

Love this!  The slight sweetness of the cake batter, the tartness of the cranberries and the almond extract flavor make this dessert lovely and soooo good!  I made this several times last year and made it again yesterday for a potluck, everyone loved it and several asked for the recipe.  The only change I make is to use almonds instead of walnuts, but either way it doesn't make that much of a difference it is still delicious.  No other alterations for me I like it just like that.  The only thing I suggest is to not use frozen cranberries.  The recipe suggests you can use frozen cranberries but I tried that once and the outer rim got a tad burnt waiting for the middle to be done.  So make sure you thaw them if necessary.  Enjoy!

I have made this many times - each time delicious.  The first time I made it cranberries were out of season, so I used a can of jellied whole cranberry sauce.  I mushed it thoroughly.  The pie turned out sweet and moist.  Also, before baking I like to sprinkle some sugar and chopped walnuts on top to make it look even more pretty!

It's also really good with rhubarb.  I sprinkle brown sugar, cinnamon and cloves on top before baking.  Very moist and delicious.

A definite keeper! The first time I baked the pie I had to get it out of the house or I would have eaten the whole thing myself.  I followed the recipe to the letter excpet that I substitued vanilla extract for the almond.  I have a huge mango tree in my yard and the mangos were coming down in spades so I decided to try it with ripe mango.  I added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of cloves and everyone loved it so much I made 2 more to give away.  I will try it with cranberries again tomorrow substituting almonds for the walnuts and using the almond extract.  I can't wait!  Thanks for a great cranberry recipe that I can use all of the cranberries I bought on sale and froze after the holidays!

Very easy and delicous. I, too, use 3/4 tsp vanilla and 1/4 tsp almond extract as 1 tsp would be too much for my taste. I've made this a couple times and am stocking up on cranberries now (in November) so that I can make it throughout the year.

This is absolutely the best!!  The flavor is wonderful with the almond and the tart berries.  It whips together in no time at all.  I generally make it with frozen berries and find it works perfect.

I made this mutliple times last Christmas and during the winter. I used the entire bag of fresh ocean spray cranberries. I have been using a square glass pan, and serve this in the morning in place of a coffee cake.  Best if it can sit atleast 24 hours before serving.

So surprisingly good! I made this as it was recommended as a light dessert and then I tried to lighten it a little more with great results.  I replaced 1/4 cup of butter with unsweetened applesauce and 1/2 cup of flour with oatmeal.  I tossed in about 1/2 cup raw apple cubed as I needed to get rid of it.  Perfect amount of sweetness to tart.  Consistancy reminded me of a cobbler.  We had vanilla Dreyer's light and creamy ice cream over our's YUM!

This is very good and very simple. I used left over fresh cranberries. It reminds me of a cobbler in a way. Added a touch of allspice and cinnamon. Will make again.

So easy. I've made it several times because it's so good yet simple. I usually add the zest of an orange because I like the combination of cranberry and orange. This last time I sprinkled the top with sparkling sugar crystals. It added a special touch. Delivered still warm to the veterinary oncologist where my dog has been having chemo. The staff gobbled it down!

Perfect as-is. Can substitute 1/4 cup + 2T oil (olive tastes good but leaves hint of green) for butter. Can use frozen cranberries, increase bake time or switch to convection bake.

I have made this recipe several times in that last few months.  First time I made it I used 1cup of fresh cranberries and 1 cup of frozen dark cherries.  I read a previous review that mentioned the sweet cherries would offset the tart cranberries and it was very good but too many berries for me.  The batter was so good that each time I've made it since I used only 1 cup of berries, most of the time only cranberries.  I use pecans or almonds instead of walnuts just b/c I don't care for walnuts.  This is very good, I wish the filling was a little creamier, but we love it as is, too!  Don't shy away from the almond extract, it makes this pie!

This had a winter holiday appeal with the red cranberries in the snow white cake.  I baked it in a 9 inch white ceramic tart pan instead of a pie plate and it looked beautiful.  This is not really a pie-like dessert and could use a better recipe name.  I did decide to stick with one type of nut, almonds: almond extract and sliced almonds (no walnuts) which worked well.  I used the topping idea from reviewer Nathan Bialke but used sliced almonds instead of walnuts: 1/2 c sliced almonds, 1/3 c brown sugar, 2 T soft butter, & 2 T flour.  The cranberries are a little tart in the sweet almond cake, but we liked it that way. I already have requests to make this again.

i was having thanksgiving dinner at the house and i was overwhelmed.  i asked my children to help make some of the dishes (which most of them came from this site) and help "mom" so i didn't have to do it all myself.  i gave this recipe to my 16 year old son to make.  he wasn't all that thrilled but did do it anyway.  when it came out of the oven it looked wonderful and i gave my son a pat on the back.  when the pie was cut into, i told my son he made it he gets the first piece.  that was a mistake because he actually ate 3/4 of the pie himself.  i told him thats is why i wanted him to start cooking more than just box mac n cheese beacause i know that he can do it.  
now for the changes that i had him make.......a few extra berries, which it really didn't need but hey, why not.  i think i seen other people have problems with the berries sinking????  not him.  it was perfect.  thanks for this recipe!!  i know my son will be making this again and again.....

Loved this recipe when made by someone else. When I made it, I doubled the recipe and used a 10x13 pan. Per some reviews, I added the zest of one orange and 2 tbl of orange juice, used vanilla extract with just a touch of almond extract, and pecans. Also made a very thin icing drizzle using conf. sugar, vanilla extract and orange juice. This is not really a pie, but more like a bar or coffeecake. Excellent a day or two later.

Never before rated a recipe on this site but feel I have to do so now.  DH and I absolutely loved this.  Used a bit of the sugar to sprinkle on the top but no other changes.  Have to stock up now on bags of cranberries. EDITED 9/13/15:  Have introduced this pie to many folks now and given out recipe so many times I can dictate from memory.  The only changes I ever make are sometimes swapping out almond with vanilla...I personally like the vanilla better, hubby likes almond.. and omitting the walnuts sometimes.  And I slightly reduce the amount of cranberries so that one bag makes two pies.  My picky s-i-l is planning on taking this pie to his family Thanksgiving and that is high praise from him. I make sure to buy several bags of cranberries before season is over so that I can store in freezer and then make this pie about once a month.  I prefer it cold. UPDATED 11/11/15:  For those who have problems using frozen cranberries... THAW before using them. Then you will have no problems.  My opinion of this dessert has not changed. Will be making for Thanksgiving again this year at request of family. I use one bag cranberries and double remaining ingredients to make two pies.  Then if not all eaten immediately I slice and freeze individual servings. Then doesn't take long to thaw one slice for me.  UPDATED 9/17:  My now 15 y-o gd requests this for every family get-together.  Have to make extra pie for her to take home.

I'm giving this a 3 because I wanted a crustless pie recipe, and this is more a cake or fruit buckle than pie.  Having said that, it is tasty and has a nice texture.  I used frozen raspberries and wild blueberries instead of cranberries so the kids would eat it, left out almond/vanilla extract completely, and used brown sugar instead of white. Baked in a 9.5 inch glass pie plate, it took 50 minutes (probably due to the frozen fruit).  Would be good with ice cream or whipped cream. I'm curious to see how it tastes the next day.

Well, I didn't have any Cranberries, and I didn't have any walnuts, so you would think that I would have given up. But I used fresh cherries and almonds instead, and it turned out delicious!
UPDATE:I have now made this several times following the recipe exactly and it is sooo good!

I thought this recipe was delightful.  Every time we have a "bring and share"......... this recipe is requested!  I modified it somewhat and added 1 cup coconut.  If you feel it may be a bit dry, just add a tad of milk, give it a good mix before putting it in baking dish.

I made this and didnt have fresh cranberries, walnuts or almond extract so I tried a can of whole cranberry sauce ( Ocean Spray ), pecans and vanilla extract and worked very nice too, this was fabulous!!!! Thanks for sharing. I loved it!!!!!
I will make sure to make it the way the recipe states next time but wanted to try it in a pinch!

I  rated this 5 stars really because it was so easy.  Everyone needs some quick and easy desserts in their recipe box and this one is added to mine.

I made two pies for two  potlucks and both parties raved about the pie.  When I read the recipe I thought it didn't sound much different than a Scottish Shortbread cookie recipe because there was no rising agent but the texture was soft and moist,....something like the texture of a shoefly pie.... and with the addition of a mound of whipped cream, very satisfying.  The only thing I tweaked was to make it a scant cup of sugar which I tend to do with most recipes. Yummy with coffee Anytime!

i just loved this--i cut back a bit on the butter (maybe 2 Tablespoons less), used half splenda, half sugar and a little less than half cup each and half whole wheat flour, half white--i think those changes made it perhaps a little healthier and no loss of flavor

Yum, this recipe is a wonderful change of pace.  (It's perfect with my morning coffee.)

I tried adding some old fashioned oats, a mashed up banana, a pinch of cinammon, and blueberries in place of the cranberries.  My experiment came out pretty tasty, too.

Thank you for the great recipe!

I made this on X-Mas Eve for X-mas the next day. I cut back on the cranberries (I used fresh) by about a half of a cup and used about half the amount of walnuts called for. I like tart things and this was really good. For me though, I think the whole 2 cups of cranberries would have been fine. One person I served it to thought it was pretty tart. However, everyone else who tried it (6 people) seemed to like it just the way it was. I sprinkled course sugar on top and it made it very pretty. I would agree that it is more cake like than pie like.. Whatever, I liked it. I know I will make this again. Good AND Simple, (and pretty too). Can't get much better than that!  Someone did mention that either adding blueberries or just making it with blueberries alone would be good too, I agree.

Delicious! I used 1.5 cups cranberries, and pecans instead of walnuts (since that is what I had) and of course served with vanilla ice cream (Edys Grand Light)! Maybe with some amaretto next time :)

It appeared and tasted like a coffee cake. The almond extract gave it a nice flavor. Next time I make it I will take the advice of Jean and serve with ice cream or cut down on the cranberries or add more sugar as it was somewhat tart.

This was absolutely delicious.  I changed only one thing.  I substituted slivered almonds for the walnuts.  I like walnuts, but I didn't think they would go with a teaspoon of almond extract.  One other thing - in no way is this a pie, but it is a marvelous and easy coffee cake.  Also, as someone else pointed out, you can bake it in a 8 inch square pan without changing the cooking time.

I've made this pie countless of times for the last 3 yrs. and never get tired of it! My dear husband begs me to make it.. fresh cranberries go out of season around this thime (March) so  he told me this year we are going to buy and freeze several of those huge bags of fresh cranberies they sell at Costco so we can have this pie thruout the year! Belive me it's that good! especially warm out of the oven whith a scoop of vanilla ice cream...WTG Jean! Elvira Silva.

I made it as listed, except I substituted white whole wheat flour for the all-purpose flour and Earth Balance for the butter.  The result was excellent!  I highly recommend trying this recipe if you have fresh cranberries sitting in your refrigerator.  My only comment is that this is really a cranberry walnut cake made in a pie pan, so don't think of it as pie.

5 stars from me!  This was such an easy and tasty recipe.  I used orange extract since I did not have any almond.  Super recipe that you can easily use with blueberries too!  I doubled the recipe and cooked it in a 9X13 pan and there were 2 pieces left after the end of the night!  I would say that my family enjoyed it :)

I made this for a holiday treat and intended to make only one.  12 pies later they are still being requested. Very easy and tasty. I made a modified pie with 1 c cranberries (fresh) and 1 cup blueberries (frozen from picking last summer) and 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 almond - wow.  It is just fabulous. I wasn't a big fan of the almond extract, so this pie is even better.  And the red and blue make a beautiful pie. 

Thanks for the recipe!

Incredibly easy and very tasty.  I stumbled upon this on accident and decided to use it as a festive dessert because it looked easy enough to make.  Well, it really was and it tasted delicious.  Everyone loved it.  I made it two days before I needed it and stored it in the fridge.  I let it get to room temperature and then warmed it in the oven while we were eating dinner.  I served it with vanilla and cookies and cream ice cream but it didn't even need it.  Great dessert to serve around the holidays when you want something a little different.

Easy and delicious.    I used 1 cup frozen cranberries and 1 cup frozen blueberries (gently folded in at the last minute so the batter does not turn purple!).  I made a brown sugar/cold butter/pecan crumble topping.  Pecans seemed more complementary to these flavors.  The cut pie appears red, white and blue -- perfect for Memorial Day.

Tartness of cranberries matched well with sweet cake.  This is more like muffins rather than pies.  It was very easy to make.

SO easy and SO delicious.  I would call it a coffee cake rather than a crustless pie though.  I used frozen cranberries (ones that I popped in the freezer a year ago and just found) and black walnuts from our own harvest.  I ended up baking about 10 min longer, probably because I used frozen berries.  I also doubled the recipe to make 2 *pies* and it served our family of 9 quite well!

easy recipe to make, tart flavor from cranberries so I topped with some sugar crystals used pecans and also used a spring form pan. I think serving with ice cream would really compliment the tartness. Reminded me more of a fritata or coffee cake.  I don't think I will make it again.

My first cranberry recipe!  VERY easy to make, pretty, and got compliments as the crumbs were being poked through.  I would call it a cobbler more than a pie. I put the mix in a well greased 9x9 pyrex pan and then added a strudel top (brown sugar, butter, chopped walnuts) and it came out super!
Gave the recipe to several people and am making more for my holiday trays right now.

This recipe was Fabulous! I was scrambling Christmas day morning for a dessert recipe that I could make quickly and easily and happened upon this one. So simple and boy was it GOOD!! After it came out of the oven, I sprinkled a little bit more white sugar on top. It also looked very festive! Thanks!! -cg

Love this recipe! It is the first thing I baked with cranberries in it this year. It has become a family favorite for us. I love how easy it is! I bake it in a tart pan and it just turns out so beautiful every time. I like to play with the toppings, sometimes it's streusel others it's just a quick drizzle of icing. Either way itis always very tasty.

I have made this for years and years (I think I found it in a Taste of Home magazine)  It is delicious.  DO NOT leave out the almond extract, it won't be the same w/o it. Trust me.  Please.  :-)

This was super easy to make but looks festive with all the bright red berries.  I used frozen berries and the batter was extremely thick (I really had to spread it around in the pan), but it baked nicely.

I combined this recipe with the brown sugar topping of "Cranberry Upside Down Coffee Cake" so I made some modifications.  I reduced the amount of sugar in the batter to 3/4 cup and added the zest of one orange plus 2 tbsp orange juice.  I folded in only half the cranberries in the batter.  The remaining cranberries and walnuts I mixed in with the brown sugar and butter and poured in the bottom of a springform pan; I spooned the batter on top of this mixture and baked as instructed.  The results were a lovely mixture of sweet and sour and looked very pretty.

Followed the recipe exactly.  Was a little tart for me, but others enjoyed it.  I think that this would work with other berries and may make it with some blackberries next time.  I do like the hint of the almond flavoring - my favorite!

This was good, especially warm.  It reminded me of a cranberry quick bread I had made before.  But using a pie plate, and topping with whipped cream, made it a little different.  Thanks.

I didn't really like this, but it's just personal taste. The cranberries were way too tart for me, but I love almond, so the cake part was good. I think I'll try it with a different fruit next time.

My grandchildren love this pie/cake!!  I increased the recipe to serve 12 - uses the whole bag of cranberries (3c.) I baked it in an 11x6 cake pan.  Was perfect.  Slightly tart, is great for breakfast!

I just love this recipe and have passed it on to several friends.  I love the idea of doing it in a tart pan and trying different berries.  I have substituted vanilla for almond extract.  It's very flexible.  But anything with cranberries is super!  thank you, Jean!

I made this the other night and everyone loved it.  I followed another reviewers suggestion and made it in a tart pan and it turned out so pretty I'm going to make one as a Christmas gift for my neighbors.  I served it at room temperature and it was fine, but I can guess it would be really good served warm with ice cream or whipped cream.  I'm also going to try making one with frozen blueberries.  Great recipe, Thanks!

What else can one say when a recipe is well reviewed, and it deserves it *as is*.  Nothing important besides:  "Yummers!"  *&* "Thanks, Jean!" all in spite of the recipe being ***easy***!!! - Well, *shhh* - feel free to not ready on really, but....... being wordy, I'll say more anyway: I think of this 'pie' as cranberry brownies in a pie pan.  Makes me think of vintage hot fudge pie (sort of like brownies in a pie pan).  Made per recipe the first time today.  Excellent as is.  Yes, we might try some deviations over time (different fruit options - from different berries, to toasted coconut, to pineapple, to at least some apple, to mangoes and maybe even peaches, to rhubarb!; in particular noting red and blue berries for patriotic holidays especially; different nuts; orange rind; try combos of whole-wheat/oat-flour/"and-or"/glutenfree-flour, raw sugar - both depending on what fruit being used; top with sugar, glaze, or crumb topping; try in tart pan, muffin tin, or double in a spring form pan; try adding cinnamon/cloves/nutmeg (again, depending on fruit being used).  But again, this is great *as is*!  Thanks again Jean, and allrecipes too!

This is one of our favorite recipes. It's so easy & so good! Like it better than cranberry bread with orange juice in. No cutting berries in half.Always have some cranberries in the freezer to make this. I usually use pecans & have been making it since 2006. I always bake it for 1 hour & like it best cooled off. Also I always use the entire bag of cranberries.

This is a great recipe!  I did not change a thing in the recipe but did bake it in a 9" springform pan.  The presentation was beautiful.  I also served it with a dollop of whipped cream. There was none left for leftovers.

4 bags of cranberries used for centerpieces for a party. Party is over and I didn't want to waste the cranberries. A coworker said to make a cranberry pie. Cranberry pie? Never heard of it. Looked up cranberry pie on Allrecipes.com and found this great recipe. Simple simple simple! Cakey type of texture, tart, not too sweet and very tasty. I didn't make any changes to this recipe and it came out fine. Since I still have a ton of cranberries left, I might make a few more batches and maybe add some orange zest or maybe some blueberries.

This is the first time I have ever commented on a recipe- but this one is AMAZING!! I normally do not like cranberries- but this changed that. The recipe is simple- my 13 year old makes it. I have definitely decided that we need to stock up on cranberries at this time of year so that we can make this dessert at other times of the year. Thanks for a GREAT recipe- :)

I LOVE this "pie" (cake).  I have made it several times in the past 2 weeks with local, fresh cranberries.  The almond taste was too strong for me, personally,but definitely better than with just vanilla, so I now use 1/4 tsp almond extract and 3/4 teaspoon vanilla.  Perfect!  I have taken it to work and shared with family.  Everyone wants the recipe.

This was delicious! I did make a few substitutions as follows: used 1/2 spelt and 1/2 brown rice flour (can't eat wheat) and replaced walnuts with chopped almonds (didn't have walnuts) and was short about 1/4 c of cranberries so put 1/4c gooseberries in to bring fruit up to 2 cups. I think I overcooked slightly but even still it was fab. Will definitely make again and try with other fruits. Thanks for posting!

This was truely amazing.  I only used 1 egg because I only had one egg, but it turned out delicious and it was almost cookie-like in texture which I loved.  I also tried it with pomegrante, which was seedy but very delicious (I substituted half of the butter with applesauce and that turned out good too). Worth a try!

I read at least half of the more than 500 reviews before I made this.  I'm not a huge fan of cranberries, but I was intrigued by this so very simple recipe.  The greatest tip I got from the reviews was the one that suggested just topping with plain brown sugar....and this turned out to be a wonderful addition/modification.  I did not use walnuts, I doubled the recipe and topped with brown sugar and oh man was it good!  I will definitely be making this again and will also try with many other berries just for fun.  I think it would work well for blackberries, blueberries, raspberries, strawberries (potentially) and I even think rhubarb would be fine as well.  A great, great recipe.  The simplicity of it makes it embarrassing when people ask for the recipe (as they did after devouring it at the pot luck). Love it, love it love!!

This is more like a quick bread then pie.  I baked it in a 9x9 pan which worked really well.  I cut back on the sugar a bit and added more nuts, just my taste.  Very quick, easy and delicious.

The tartness definitely comes out. I would have macerated the cranberries for a little while before if I had known - but it came out so excellent even with the tartness that I have to give this 5 stars! It's probably perfect as is with whipped cream or ice cream. So I think I'll add one of the two and see. The consistency was amazingly moist and moderately dense in the best way! I opted for vanilla extract instead of the almond extract because I find even the smallest drops overpowering except, of course, in almond cookies. :) I highly recommend this quick and easy dessert. It's a keeper!

This turned out really well!  I only made a few changes.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla, a dash of cinnamon and exchanged pecans for the walnuts because that's what I had on hand.  Delicious!  I plan to make this again!

I made this with the butter subbed for applesauce and splenda instead of sugar and pecans instead of walnuts. The result is wonderful, the texture is, of course, different than it would be if I followed the recipe and used butter instead of applesauce but the flavour if great! Not too sweet and not too tart. A very nice light snack.

Oh my goodness!! This is creation is absolutely wonderful!! I have made this many times now, it is a popular request, and the recipe is repeatedly given out. I have made this as the original recipe, with fresh cranberries, as well as with frozen. When using frozen berries, the batter is super thick, to which I added 1 Tablespoon of milk. It seems to take about 5 minutes or so longer to bake. I have also made this with an addition of 1 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon of cloves - awesome! I have found when using pecans I use vanilla only instead of almond extract. This crust-less pie is similar in texture to a coffee cake. This recipe is quick and easy! Makes a very tasty and impressive dessert! A definite keeper – thanks!

To me, this is more like a cobbler than a pie. I've made this twice.  The first time as written, the second time with just a few minor changes.  Both times I used a standard bag of cranberries, which is now 12 oz, so only 1 1/2 cups of berries but it is enough.  I also increased the almond extract to 2 tsp and switched to almonds.  I liked it better with my changes.  Very easy to make, pretty treat that is a nice tart companion to a cup of tea.  Thanks for sharing!

Very good and super easy!  Next time I will double and bake in a 9x13 pan because as others noted it is more "bread" like.  It also tasted better the next day after being stored in the fridge.  We didn't think it was too tart at all.  A good company coffee cake.

Sweet and bitter. Very delicious; smells wonderful when it's baking in the oven. Excellent, quick; a simple recipe (even versatile). My favorite :) ~ and a great way to use up cranberries! :)
Also, I've been using the whole cranberry bag...and I don't have nuts, but still delicious!

I keep reviewing the ingredients to make sure I followed the recipe correctly.  I did and this is the joke of my house this evening.  Husband was daring son to taste the "pie".  My mom wondered what I was thinking when I made something with 2 cups of cranberries and only one cup of sugar.  I can say it was very pretty.  Looked delicious.  Was so tart it curled my toes.

It is delicious; however, I don't consider this a pie. It is more along the lines of a coffee cake which makes it perfect for Thanksgiving morning. Its simplicity is a great way to start the day when there are so many other things to do. It is too heavy to be a dessert.

Very yummy! I would definitely label this as more of a "coffee cake" rather than a pie - mine didn't have the thick brownie like texture that some ppl talked about (maybe I over baked slightly). But the taste was excellent!  I put on the crumb topping lots of people mentioned (1/4 c. walnuts, 1/3 cup brown sugar, 2 tab. butter, 2 tab. flour), didn't add any extra sugar, and I thought it was perfect! The cranberries were NOT too tart! I will be making this again!

This recipe is pretty good with the brown sugar/almond topping suggested by another user.  It would be way too tart without it.

This is one of my favorites.  It took about 10 mins longer to cook.  I addded vanilla extract instead of almond because I don't like almond.  Excellent and couldn't be easier.  I'm going to try next with blueberries.

This was decent. Relly easy, nice consistency. It didn't drive me mad with desire but I took it to a potluck and there was very little leftover. Thanks for a nice recipe.

Yummy! I made as a pie and also as mini pies in cupcake pans. Only change is that you need to mix berries and nuts before adding to baking dish. Also, if making mini pies, do not use cupcake papers the batter is just too sticky. Turned out much better without cupcake papers.

Excellent - everyone raved.  Made exactly.  The walnuts weren't to my taste, I would have prefered raisins, but everyone else liked the nuts.  Would make again for sure.

I made 6 pies today. I am the cook at a local senior living center and everyone loved this pie. I served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Very good. The only things I did differently was I used half the amount of almond extract and grated the  rind of one orange per pie into the mix. Thanks for sharing!

Made this in an 8x8 in pan and added 1/2 tsp orange extract and 1 tsp cinnamon. Also cut cranberries in half so they were more spread out through the pie. Great recipe  It's a keeper!

I made this for one of our Thanksgiving desserts, but think it is more of a cranberry coffee cake/breakfast pastry. I will add the crumbly crust that another member suggested and serve it up Christmas morning!

Delish! I made mine gluten free, and added a 1/2 t xanthan gum to assure it it held together. And also, made a crumb topping using almonds instead of walnuts, as,we are allergic. Yummmo!!! Next time I make this I will add a smidge of vanilla as well. Thanks for the great recipe:)

This is a GREAT recipe, and even my husband, who's not a fan of cakes and pies, loves it! I made a few changes, using hazelnuts instead of walnuts, homemade chunky cinnamon applesauce instead of butter, and sweetener instead of sugar. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

The only change I made was to swap out some of the cranberries for some frozen olallieberries that I wanted to use up. Had to bake it 10 minutes longer because olallies are juicier, but it came out great! Definitely will make again. Thanks Jean!

this was a verry tart dessert- made it for thanksgiving and it definitely went well with the meal. do not be expecting a sweet cake/pie out of this recipe- i think i might add some brown sugar or use a little less cranberries next time to cut the tartness a bit. i used crushed almonds instead of walnuts, and made a streusel topping like suggested by others- it was very pretty and had a really unique taste!

You wanna make this even more amazing?  Singe the outside.  Get your cast iron round pan really hot a greased up in the oven, then poor the batter in to bake it.  The outside will be crispy and AMAZING!

Delish and so easy. More like a snack cake, though that might have been because of my changes. I used all whole wheat flour, 3/4 c honey instead of the sugar, substituted half the butter for plain yogurt and almonds instead of walnuts. I baked in a square cake pan, since I didn't have a pie pan. It only took 35 minutes for me. Very tasty!

This was a delicious cake (not at all a pie to me).  I took it to Thanksgiving and it was a hit, even with very young kids.  I baked it without the walnuts (which is why I think it was like, even by the kids!) The bitterness and tartness of the cranberries completely mellows when it bakes.

So quick to make, my daughter whipped it up in minutes. Puckery-tart cranberries are really showcased in the cake-like filling. I think it really is better the next day. Maybe our extract is extra strong, because a generous 1/2 tsp. was plenty, and vanilla supplied the other half-teaspoon. I am going to double the walnuts next time; they were very yummy. DO LINE YOUR PAN WITH WAXED PAPER circles (greased). At least the bottom will come out. Finally, I enjoyed reading all the reviews, and plan to make this a *trademark* recipe by varying the fruits, extracts and nuts like the rest of you!  Thanks, Jean! =)

I've made this twice, and the first time I followed the recipe as written (except I used vanilla extract instead of almond). It had too many cranberries, and wasn't cooked all the way through. So I tweaked it a bit for the second batch and it was great! The second time I used only 1 c. cranberries, added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp ground cloves to the dry ingredients, plus sprinkled a generous amount of brown sugar on the top just before putting it in the oven. I cooked it about 7 minutes longer than the recipe called for, and it was just scrumptious! I brought the second batch to a Christmas party and it got rave reviews.

Very Very good and very easy to make!!! I love cranberries, so I had to try this recipe. I did not have almond extract so I used vanilla. It was good, but I think next time I make this I will definitely  use almond. I will also temper my eggs before putting in the batter. It made the melted butter hard using cold eggs. I think this recipe is very versatile. You could use many different flavors of extracts, nuts or berries and toppings. Thanks again for the wonderful recipe.

this dessert is like a cake or brownie in texture, and it is absolutely delicious. i used 1/4 cup plain yogurt and 1/4 cup melted butter.  1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup splenda. also, i put the cranberries and nuts in a plastic bag with a tiny bit of flour and shook it to coat them with flour so they wouldn't drop down to the bottom of the pie pan.  really, really liked this.

I didn't change a thing and I absolutely love this!  It tastes like Christmas - the almond extract is the perfect touch.  And it could not be easier.  I highly recommend it!

Very easy and excellent flavor. I used sliced almonds and added the juice of 1/2 orange and about 1 TBSP orange zest. I used "Better N Eggs" for the 2 eggs and it was still wonderful! I'm getting ready to make it again to share with my work buddies.

saw this recipe and thought i had to try it i just happen to have 2 bags of frozen cranberrys in my freezer which i had plans on making something else with them but i saw this and had to try it ran down stairs and threw the berrys in the strainer to thaw while making dinner.
 i followed the recipe  but i did add 1 tsp cinnamon and 2 dashes of nutmeg didnt have almond so i used vanilla have to have cinnamon..LOL anyway i also had to let it cook an extra 5 minutes. it turned out wonderful i didnt have any walnuts. but i was in a hurry i had to try this so next time i will add probably some pastachio nuts , i made two tonight . one in a 9 inch pie pan and the other in a 8x8 glass square baking dish , i am taking one to share with my co workers tomorrow and we have one for us here at home.
so simple and easy to make whips up in a flash..
i tryed it both with a spoon of ice cream and with out both ways are great.
thanks for sharing this recipe.
update for this pie.
everyone at the office adored this when i brought it last week, i drizzled dark chocolate over it its amazing everyone raved about it.
making it again  tonight for a Christmas party

EXCELLENT!  I made this recipe many years ago, given to me by a cranberry bog owner.  I'm very happy to have found it again.  I sprinkle a little sugar on the top before baking and it's PERFECT.  So easy and so nice not to have a clean beaters.  Thank you SO much.

Yum.  I'd say it is really more like a cranberry coffeecake.  I used half whole wheat flour/half regular flour.  My daughter is busily eating every warm crumb of it, so I guess she likes it too.

I am a bit torn on this one. Half the people loved it, half the people hated it. I happened to like it but not love it. It does look very pretty though.

This was a great something different for the holidays!  I made it for a Thanksgiving dessert. I made it according to the recipe, except I substituted slivered almonds. The tart and sweet were a great combination; a refreshing change from traditional desserts. Added bonus is how quick and easy this was to prepare!

This is one of our family's all-time favorite desserts. Easy to make, we leave out the nuts (my preference), and add a little extra almond flavoring. Most people love it! Great warm with vanilla ice cream or cold for a snack.

This was a great dessert! The entire pie was gone! Great compination between tart and sweet. My sister is diabetic so I used 1/2 cup splenda and 1/2 cup real sugar and it still tasted great!

This recipe was amazing.  The entire pie was eaten at Thanksgivng dinner, even by people who don't really like cranberry.  It tastes somewhat like shortbread or maybe a tart, but is extremely moist and gets a little crunchy on top.  It was also really easy to make.

My intentions when making this pie was to serve it as a dessert after our Thanksgiving dinner, but it never made it that far!  Once it came out of the oven and everyone saw how beautiful it was, it was consumed in no time.  I think I will add a handful more of walnuts, but I would not change anything else.  It's definitely on the list for a Christmas morning treat.

This was excellent, the perfect balance between sweet and tart, and the nuts added a lot as well.  My only (minor) complaint is that it was really greasy, what with all that butter.  I might try to reduce some of the butter next time, or replace some of it with applesauce.  I'll definitely be making this over and over again as I just couldn't stop eating it the first time I made it.

This recipe is so easy.  Made for Xmas dinner and served with ice cream.  To save time I made it about 4 hours before dinner and put it in the warm oven for about 10 min covered before I served it with ice cream.  Cooked it for a few extra minutes.  Everyone loved it and all wanted the recipe.

Excellent recipe which was enjoyed by all Christmas Eve.  I ate the little bit of leftover on Christmas morning and I think I liked it even better as a coffee cake.  I did have to cook it an extra 8 minutes so be sure to test for doneness.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Absolutely wonderful. First time I baked it, I used cranberries out of the fridge, and the pie was undercooked in the middle (nevermind, I love raw dough/batter). I baked it again yesterday with cranberries at room temperature, had to bake it for 5 minutes longer than written on the recipe, and it came out perfect.
I am usually not a big fan of almond extract, but it goes very well in this recipe.

Excellent! I doubled this recipe and made it in a 13x9 pan, which worked out fine. I also reduced the amount of cranberries, added in just a touch more sugar, and added a struesel topping so I would get a coffee cake type result. It was super yummy, moist and delicious! I got huge compliments from all my coworkers. Will definitely be a keeper. Thanks!

I'm considering making this for Christmas, so I thought I'd whip up a "test" batch.  This is fabulous!  Many desserts are way too sweet, but this is just right.  The cranberries are tart, and the cake is sweet.  A perfect combination!  Its definitely on the Christmas menu!

Wow, this turned out fantastic! made this for pi day (of course) but also because I have four pounds of cranberries in my freezer. Don't shy away from the teaspoon of almond extract - it makes this pie what it is. I skipped the nuts and used the cranberries straight from the freezer.  I also wound up baking this for an extra 10 minutes - it didn't seem quite done in the center at 40 min.

3 19 15 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/12398/crustless-cranberry-pie/ ... Mine turned out like the 13th photo.  Pretty.  It's a sugar-cookie-ish tasting cake with cranberries.  It has a slightly crisp top, tender inside & not too much cake.  Berry amount is perfect.  Next time, there will be a next time, I'll use a bit less sugar.  I only added 1/4t almond extract & no nuts.  'Baked in an 8x8, 35.  Reviews show how creative you can be with this recipe.  Bonus.  I'll have to remember that.  Thanks for the recipe, Jean!  :)CHRISTMAS'18: 1.5c sugar & 1t almond extract for double recipe in 9x13 is bueno!  Look at edges rather than center - or use toothpick test - for doneness.  The center will look moist even when baked completely.

I made this yesterday and it was delicious. Tart and sweet at the same time.  I substituted 1/2 Splenda for 1/2 sugar. I will definitely make this again.

Use 1/4 tsp almond and 3/4 tsp vanilla and make the streusel topping.  Fabulous!

This was a great recipe. My daughter is allergic to nuts so I used vanilla extract instead of the almond. Also made a topping with brown sugar, coconut, and butter. Eliminated the walnuts.

This is really delicious but there isn't anything "pie" about it, other than the pan.  I made it exactly as written with fresh cranberries and wouldn't change anything other than next time I'll put it in an 8 x 8 pan.  Perfect served slightly warm with whipped cream.

This wasn't bad, just not what I expected. I always made orange cranberry bread for my kids which they LOVE. I added a little orange peel to the recipe and it tasted exactly like the bread I make, not a dessert.

Made this exactly as per the recipe (except I added fresh grated orange peel) and the cranberries were too tart for my family's taste.  Had most of it left over so tonight i will serve with a sweet orange glaze.  That might help.  The batter portion was nice and we loved the almond flavor, but sweetness was not enough to offset the tartness of the berries.  This recipe has potential, so next time, I am going to cook the cranberries in orange juice as I would for cranberry sauce, but just enough so that the berries have just popped and so that the sauce is very dry and thick.  Then I will combine it with the cake batter gently so that cranberries are just swirled into the batter.  This way the berries will have already been sweetened to cut the tartness, and it should work out better for my family's sweet tooth!

I LOVE cranberries and this is my favorite of all.  "Cakey" but not "fluffy" texture.  The tartness of the cranberries really shines through so don't "over" sugar.  I made originally for a Cmas desert but we love it so much that as long as I have cranberries (frozen) then we have it anytime.  Delicious!

A bit sticky and sweet for my taste (and I like sweet!), so I did a lot of experimenting, and here's my version. First, definitely have the cranberries at room temperature, it's so much easier.  Preheat oven to 350 F. Mix together: 1.5 cups flour, 3/4 cup sugar, 1/4 tsp salt, 1.5 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp baking soda, 1/2 cup ground almonds (or ground walnuts), and lots of grated orange rind. Go all around the middle of the orange; don't worry if it clumps in the flour. Once mixed, stir in 2 cups cranberries. Pour in 1/2 cup melted butter, 2 eggs (whisked briefly beforehand), 1 tsp vanilla, and optionally 1/2 tsp almond extract.  Stir carefully (but firmly) with a strong spoon.  Put it into a (greased?) 9-inch pan, and gently pat it down until flat.  I used a 9-inch silicon pan. The baking time is shorter! 32-35 minutes, definitely no more than 35.  Enjoy!

Also, as others have suggested, I always add crumb topping.  If you like cranberries, you will love this recipe.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving and did not really like it. It was simple and easy, but did not taste good. It was kinda like cake and kinda like pie, but was neither and something in between. I did not like the texture, it was kinda like cake. It was also a bit too sweet from the cranberries for me. I will not make again.

You will not need to change a thing for this recipe.  I added more walnuts and a tiny bit more almond extract for the second one I made which was the next day.  Wow - so good and so easy to make.  This is another good one for kids to do.

This pie is a wonderful combination of sweet and tart flavors. I sometimes add pecans because my husband can't have walnuts but otherwise made the recipe exactly as written. It is so easy to prepare and has wonderful flavor. Thank you, Jean, for this delicious recipe!  Amendment: I have always made this with fresh cranberries and as such it is my all time favorite dessert. There are no fresh cranberries to be found at this time of year and so I tried frozen cranberries. I was really disappointed  in the taste of this dessert. It was way too tart. If you've only made this with frozen cranberries and didn't like it try again with fresh. It is wonderful with fresh cranberries. Adding some orange zest is great, too! I like to divide the batter into 3 - 6" pie plates and bake them for 28 minutes. One of the three pies is just the right size for my husband and I to eat with 2 slices each. I freeze the other two pies.

This was good. I made it in an 8 inch square pan and had to bake it for 50 minutes.  My husband liked the almond flavoring, but it was not quite sweet enough for him. 
I made it a second time and sprinkled course sugar over the top before I baked it. Better. You could use less cranberries to make it more cake-like.

I replaced the pecans with almonds.  I baked in a 8x8 pan.  I melted some store bought vanilla frosting in the microwave and added on top like a glaze.  This is so good.

I have made this delightful 'pie' many times for our family and as baked gifts for friends. Pecans are the only nut we can eat, scratch walnuts. Did add a Tbls. of candied ginger this last bake. I add the cranberries at the end of the preparation of the batter. Oh! I buy my vast amounts of cranberries over the holidays, freeze the bags, and have them to draw from all year long. We treat this as a morning coffee cake, and as a dessert, and held in the hand...a run out the door, "gotta get to school!".  Now, do you suppose I could use the batter recipe as a base for fruitcake citrons?

Are you kidding me? This has to be one of the easiest and yummiest recipes on this site. I used maybe 3 cups of frozen cranberries I had in my freezer, but used a package of slivered almonds because it's what I had in the pantry. Also took another reviewer's advice and added a half vanilla extract and fourth almond. It was so good hot and room temperature. Everyone must make this it ROCKS.

I thought it was easy and very good! It's tart, so a scoop of vanilla ice cream is a perfect compliment, especially when it's still warm out of the oven or reheated in the microwave for a few seconds!

I made this recipe by first melting the butter, then adding the sugar.  Next coat the cranberries with the sugar mix, that way each cranberry has its own sweetening.  I dumped in all the rest of the ingredients, put in 1/4 teaspoon almond extract, 1/2 teaspoon orange extract and 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract and mixed it all thoroughly making sure that there was no flour on the bottom of the bowl.  I also added a handful of fresh blueberries and a chopped apple on the top of the pie and gently pushed it into the middle.  It is SUPER GOOD with vanilla ice cream when it is still warm.  This will be our new Thanksgiving Eve dessert!!

I've made this recipe four times in the past two weeks using frozen cranberries from last season! It's been a big hit and friends have asked me to make it again and asked for the recipe. It's delicious and probably one of the easiest items I've ever baked. I made it three times in a standard pie pan and doubled the recipe to fit nicely in a 13x9 pan. The only thing I did different was to sprinkle a few extra cranberries on top as a previous reviewer suggested. Be careful with the almond extract, it's pretty strong stuff. I used only 1/2 tsp. in 9 inch pie pans and 1 tsp. in the 9x13 pan and the flavor blended perfectly with the cranberries. I will definitely add this to my holiday recipes. I'll also buy extra bags of cranberries before the season is over and freeze them so I can enjoy this at Easter and as a special treat throughout the year! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

I have to admit that I was a little disappointed in this.  I had hoped for something juicier and I thought this was too dry.  It really does need some whipped cream or ice cream to give it the moisture it lacks.

This is magnificent; friends said it was "their favorite" and asked for the recipe.  I made in in a cheesecake pan, which worked great.  After it cooled, I drizzled a little almond frosting on it (powd sugar, cream and almond extract).  You could use it as a coffee cake, too.  I'll be making this a lot.  THANK YOU for the recipe!!!

This is a great, simple recipe, and it tastes great!  I agree with the reviewer, who said it could be done with half the butter.  I added the streusel topping suggested by Nathan Bialke, and it is wonderful!

I will need to rename this to quick cranberry bread. Very easy and delicious but really more like a cake or muffin. 2nd time I made it I used half brown and half white sugar. This was a great choice, really caramelized nicely. I also did half wheat flour - batter consistency was not good but came out great in the end. Next time I will add some zest, either orange or lime. Served it for breakfast, yummy. A couple of notes: it's starting to be too buttery and greasy. I may try oil or using less butter next time. For easier mixing, add liquid to dry mixture, stir a few times and then add cranberries/nuts.

Hubby & I thought this was simply outstanding.  The tartness of the cranberries worked perfectly against the sweetness of the *cake* (which is more like what mine turned out to be).  Either way - with whipped cream and coffe it was delicious.  I'd like to try again with a) a mix of berries (maybe some cherries?) and with the struesal topping others have mentioned.  Thanks so much for recipe.

Yummy! Great way to get rid of frozen cranberries that we stocked up on during a sale.  I would only use 1 1/2 cups of frozen cranberries and chop them to distribute the flavor more.  I also used pecans instead of walnuts. Great flavor!

So good and easy!  I've also made this with chopped rhubarb from my garden and with fresh blueberries.  I think it is better the next day when the flavors have mellowed together a bit.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

This is about the best dessert I've made from this site.  First off - it is most definitely more cake-like than a pie.  Secondly - if you like the tartness of fresh cranberries, you need to try this recipe.  There is just the right amount of sugar to balance the cranberries.  The next time I'm going to cut the sugar 3/4 a cup because I like tart.  I had to use pecans because I was out of walnuts.  I toasted them@ 350 for about 7 minutes to enhance their flavor before adding them to the other ingredients.  This was wonderful hot out of oven topped with a small scoop of ice cream.  But, we did enjoy it at room temp the next day also.  So glad I have extra cranberries in the freezer.l

Super yummy way to use cranberries.  Didn't have walnuts so I used chopped almonds (didn't have sliced).  Next time, and there will be a next time, I will just forgoe the nuts completely.  It's good enough on it's own.  Might add a little orange zest.  You must serve warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  My entire family, young kids too, loved it.

I made this "pie" last Thanksgiving. It has a great, but very tart flavor. My family had suggested I make it in a loaf pan next time because it was more like a bread. I didn't like the presentation of the pie because of all the little holes across the top from the air escaping the cranberries (?).

This is more of a coffee cake than a pie but it is delicious. So easy to mix up and bake. I took others advice and used 1/4 t. of almond extract and 3/4 t. of vanilla. The almond was still very noticeable but not overpowering. I love anything cranberry and this will be one I make again. All the family also enjoyed it. For ease of making and loads of flavor, try this, you won't be disappointed.

Agree with most everybody else that this isn't exactly a pie... more like a cobbler and as that, it is very tasty indeed. I like the tartness of the cranberries intermingling with the sweet batter. Simple and easy to put together dessert. You must enjoy tart fruits to like this though. Made the following changes: used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup applesauce and baked in 8x8 glass baking dish and turned out fine.

Very good and very easy.  Tastes great warm with vanilla ice cream.  Yummm!  I took the suggestions of other reviewers and did 1/2 vanilla and 1/2 almond extract.  I also made the walnut/brown sugar topping and sprinkled it on top before baking.

This is more like a coffee cake than a pie.  It was really good, I served it with breakfast though, not as a dessert.  The only modification I made was using 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 all purpose white flour.  I will try some with ice cream for dessert tonight.  I would give 4 stars for a cranberry coffee cake, but as a pie, only 3.

Delicious!  My family loves this recipe so much that I double it every time I make it.  A few changes I make:  I use vanilla extract instead of almond, I add 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the pie and I always make the strussel topping (recipe left by another reviewer).  This is a great alternative to boring coffee cake and it makes a really wonderful dessert served warm with vanilla ice cream.  Added bonus, this recipe is SO easy to make!

This really wasn't all that great. The texture was like a dense cake, and there was not enough sugar to off-set the tartness of 2 cups of whole cranberries. I do think this has potential with more liquid and more sugar, though. Thanks for sharing!

This was wonderful!!  I was concerned about it being way too tart, but it wasn’t at all.  As other reviewers suggested, I used 1/4 t. of almond extract and 3/4 t. of vanilla.  I opted to use an 8 1/2" springform pan, rather than a 9” pie plate, which produced a pretty skinny pie, and even though I coated my pan generously with non-stick cooking spray my pie stuck terribly to the bottom of my pan.  Not the recipe’s fault, but next time I will use the pie plate or a smaller springform pan and I will put non-stick foil on the bottom for easier removal.  Regardless of my problems, this was delicious and I’ll be making it again.  UPDATE 6/24/12 - I made this again using blueberries.  Very good!!

I agree with the other reviewers that this is more like a coffee cake which I presumed when I read the recipe.  This was an easy and tasty recipe that is out of the norm of what I usually bake.  I prefer a sweet cake, and the berries are very tart in this cake.  This is a recipe that my husband would say “has a grown-up taste”  so the little ones may not care for it as much, but we thought it was very good.

I was looking for something different for Thanksgiving dessert and one that my husband would eat.  He seemed dubious about my selecting this recipe, but with first bite - "This is good!"  I followed others suggestions and added vanilla, cutting back on the almond extract.  This would also be good as a coffee cake!  Thanks for sharing!

What a hit!! Chosen for its simplicity and ingredients...did not fall short in taste! Made this recipe using cupcake liners and in an 8 inch round. Would make again and again!!  Couple additions and changes....Added apples as another suggested, 3/4 C whole cranberries, 1/4 peeled chopped apples.  Added vanilla instead of almond extract and the best was the brown sugar topping I added!  Butter, chopped walnuts, flour and brown sugar - put on top prior to baking and made the dish!  Enjoy!!!

Not bad. Mom liked that it wasn't too sweet. I followed the recipe exactly, except I opted for sliced almonds instead of walnuts, left out a tiny bit of sugar (1-2 tbsp probably), did 1/2 vanilla/almond extract, added a bit of cinnamon (1 tbsp?), and a tiny bit of clove and nutmeg. After baking it 35 minutes, I sprinkled on some Swedish chunky bits of sugar and baked it 5 more minutes. Then I left it in the turned-off oven for a few hours which might explain why the top crust was a bit crunchy. Next time, I'd halve or 3/4 the butter, pull it out of the oven on time and also try the streusel topping the other reviewers mentioned.

I've been making this pie for years and everyone always loves it.  I follow the recipe with no changes. You can get it in the oven in under 15 minutes - so easy to make!

I tried to make this pie as noted and it was terrible.  I was unable to get the center to bake even after 50 minutes... Not one of my favorites.

I made this pie for a dinner party last night and it was a great success. I wanted to give the recipe a "test run" before Thanksgiving and it will definitely be on my dessert menu that day. Pumpkin pie is a given for Thanksgiving but I am always looking for another pie to add to the menu.  This is it for this year. It's more like a cake or fruit pudding than a pie but it was delicious.

I made a version of this pie gluten-free.  Since my family doesn't like cranberries.  I used apples instead.  I was skeptical when there wasn't any baking powder or baking soda, but only one reviewer mentioned adding a bit of baking powder, so I left it alone.  It looked like such a good model recipe that I changed it up to suit my family's tastebuds.
I used 1 cup of a gluten-free flour blend 
[the whole recipe is 6 cups white rice flour, 2 cups potato flour and 1 cup tapioca flour]
I did not have to add any xanthan gum for this pie to hold together.
2 cups of apples cut to the same size as the cranberries
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1/2 cup dark brown sugar instead of 1 cup white sugar, 
1/2 cup toasted rolled oats  
about 1/2 tsp cinnamon 
1 tsp vanilla (omitted the almond extract).  
I kept the eggs, salt, butter and walnuts the same.  Baked at the same temperature and for 45 minutes. Glad that I buttered every part of the pan that this pie touched.  The result was so good.  I want to try it  next with blueberries.     Thank you for such a delicious and easy recipe.

This was super easy and super tasty. I think next time I will omit the almond extract and just try 1 1/2 tsp vanilla. But it was great!

Really good and easy!!! Didn't have a pie pan, just a glass pie dish, lowered the temp to 325 and also made the following changes:
Used used 1/2 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup powdered stevia (the one used for baking-there is different kinds of powdered stevia). 1/4 tsp almond extract and 3/4 tsp vanilla extract per prior reviews. To help with moisture because of the stevia, I added 1/4 cup light sour cream. It actually worked and made it nice and moist without ruining the taste of the dish. Also added less then 1/8 tsp baking powder.

Outstanding with vanilla ice cream. I make this all fall & winter as long as the fresh cranberries are in the grocery stores. I use more as crumble instead of a pie as I am never successful slicing up a pie slice and serving it without it falling apart. That does not diminish the wonderful flavor of this dessert. One of my favorites!

OK...!I know it's pink, that's because I used a can of cranberry instead of fresh or frozen, it doesn't make much difference except you need to bake it for a few minutes longer, other then that it's a great pie but I recommend holding back on the almond extract if you seek perfection :) enjoy.

I made this recipe with some very long-lived cranberries I had bought at Christmas time and it was delicious, easy, and very pretty.  I only wish I had found this before the holidays so I could have shown it off.  Thank you for submitting.

I used frozen cranberries and pulsed them in my food processor to cut them up a bit.  Used pecans instead of walnuts (only nuts I had in the pantry).  Did everything else as written.  This dessert is absolutely to die for.  We liked it better after it cooled.

Not fair to call it a pie, but call it what you want, this is DELICIOUS.  It's very sweet, so I think it can stand up to some extra zing, so sometimes I add some orange zest and use lemon extract instead of almond

Very good and super simple to put together, however the cranberries are a bit tart so I put powdered sugar on top and next time some whipped cream.

Surprisingly good!  Even my cranberry hating...but pie loving husband liked it.  I did add the extra spices and topping (which was almost too sweet), and diced one apple up for extra crunchiness.  Will certainly make again.  Thanks for the great recipe from a cranberry lover!

If you like the natural tartness of cranberries, you'll like this. They pair well with the buttery cake. Best eaten on day one, that is if you prefer the crispness of the crust like I do!

Perfect!  So easy and tastes divine!  To mix it up a little I substituted vanilla in place of the almost extract.  I also added a 1/2 tsp. of orange extract.  Next time I'll throw in a few spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, etc.) to give it a real Christmas feel.  Can't wait to make it again!

I love this recipe. My slight variation is to use 1/2 cup sliced almonds instead of walnuts and 2 teaspoons of almond extract. I also chop the cranberries in a chopper. Mine this time was not quite done because I cooked it at 325 (because of the turkey) and it was still a little gooey at 40 minutes, but we ate it anyway and it was even better gooey (with whipped cream)!

I made the recipe as written and it was delicious! The almond extract worked well with the tartness of the cranberry and the chopped walnut gave it a nice bite (I coarsely chopped mine). It was also quick to put together. This is going into my keeper file. Thank for sharing this recipe, Jean!!!

Very good! I made it exactly as directed it was very tart but very tasty. I think I might decrease the Almond to 1/2 tsp. I love almond so it was good for me but a bit much for others.  I doubled the recipe and used two round cake pans since I read other reviews that it was more cake like, perfect.

This was super easy to make.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I served it with fresh whipped cream and it was FANTASTIC.  It was a big hit with my parents.  I will definitely serve this again, especially during the upcoming holiday season.  It would even make a delicious breakfast item.  It kind of reminds me of a moist scone.  The cranberries were not too tart, it was WONDERFUL!

The chopped walnuts complimented the tartness of the fresh cranberries.  Not juicy but amazing fresh flavors and when warm w/ vanilla ice cream..so good!

Great recipe, though I made some changes.  I left out the nuts (hubby doesn't like them) and I used less sugar (almost half).  It was definitely still sweet enough.  It seemed a little greasy, though, so next time I think I'll also replace half the butter with milk (otherwise I fear the batter may be too dry).  Oh, I also replaced the almond extract with vanilla.  And the cranberries with raspberries.  OK, quite a few changes in the end but still a great recipe!!

Fantastic.  Just fantastic.    I used almonds instead of walnuts, because that's what I had.  More like a cake than a pie, though.  Would be good with any berry.

This was incredible!  I loved the tart cranberry flavor with the sweet cake.  I did use the yummy topping as others did.  Also, I have made this twice and it definitely came out better as a coffee cake than a pie.  It baked better in a 9x13 (I doubled it) than in a pie dish.  I also preferred the full amount of almond flavoring.  Really adds a nice flavor.  Thanks for the great recipe that is SUPER easy!

WOW!  This is really amazing, and very easy, especially since you don't have to chop the cranberries.  Made it just as written.  It tastes great!  Not quite pie, not quite cake, but chewy and sweet.  Yum!! Everyone here loved it.

This was unbelievably good, even though I changed the recipe significantly.  I live in a country where cranberries are not readily available, so instead, I used a frozen berry mix with cherries, strawberries, raspberries, and currants.  It was wonderful!  Nice sweetness, but the currants balanced it out nicely.  Like other reviewers- I added slivered almonds and a strudel topping.  The strudel topping was the one listed by another rater (1/3 c. br. sugar, 2 tbl butter and flour).  The strudel worked wonderfully- really made it work.  I would add it again every time.  I also made a change in using vanilla extract, as it was all I could find, but it worked nicely.  Added a little cinnamon to the batter too.  The pie needed baking for 10-15 minutes more than the recipe called for.  With vanilla ice cream this is a real treat!

Fantastic recipe. This is so easy to make. My boyfriends doesn't even like cranberries and he finished his piece in record time.  I added 1/2 Gala apple (cut in small pieces) and my friends commented on that (nice crunch and flavor). This will definitely be my go to "pie". Next time I want to use blueberries and maybe add some lemon (leave out the almond extract) as one other reviewer suggested. Absolutely delicous.

Loved this. I usually do not bake but this was too tempting a recipe not to try. So easy AND tasty. A little tart but afterall it is cranberries!! I followed another reviewers suggestion and substitutted Splenda for 1/2 the sugar. A hint: we stock up on fresh cranberries right before Thanksgiving when they are plentiful (and usually cheaper) in the stores and freeze the cranberries right in the bags. That way we have fresh cranberries to use all year round. I will definitely be making this recipe again and again.

On advice of another reviewer, I put the cranberries and nuts (I used pecans) in the pan and poured the batter over-- very easy.  You don't even need to measure the cranberries, because 2 cups = enough to cover the bottom of the pie pan.  Used whole wheat flour and vanilla extract.  Yummy!

I love this recipe. I made this at my restaurant as a weekly special and it quickly became a regular menu item. The only thing I do differently is double it so that the slice I serve is larger. It's wonderful...a little crunchy on the top and moist inside. 5 stars!!!!

Absolutely wonderful. My minor changes were that I made it in an 8x8 square pan and sprinkled sugar on top about half way through baking for a light crust. Thanks for the recipe!

Made it twice as double batch in large cast iron skillet. Sorry folks but I didn't use cranberries. The  first one I used a can of splenda cherry pie filling with an additionol can of apple pie filling. I did not have or add walnuts . EXCELLENT!  The second one[double batch again] , I used two cans of splenda cherry pie filling. Awesome!! NOTE when using the splenda pie filling I only use one cup sugar for a DOUBLE batch. I'll try cranberries next.

We love this pie. I have made it twice now and everybody seems to like it very much. Only change is that I put some coarse sugar on top for extra crunch.I bake it a day ahead and let it sit in fridge overnight. Then make it come to room temperature and serve with vanilla ice-cream. Thank you for posting this wonderful recipe:)

This was very good! Instead of the cranberries I used left-over homemade cranberry relish that was frozen from Thanksgiving. It turned the batter a reddish/brown color, but it tasted great! I did cut back on the sugar; since the relish already had plenty in it. Will make again!

I actually made this pie with a crust... and it got insanely good reviews. At first I thought it would be too heavy, but from what I was told... the crust was the best part... well, almost. The pie itself was scrumptious. It needed to be in the oven a bit longer than the recipe stated, but that might just be because of the crust. I kept it in for an hour, and it was still somewhat underdone. That's ok though, cuz over here, we like our pastries extra chewy. My boyfriend's mom sent him back home with a bag of cranberries so I can make another pie! Talk about a hit!

I've used this recipe two Thanksgivings in a row. I love the almond flavoring and the wonderful consistency of the batter when cooked. The only change I make is reducing the amount of cranberries to 1.5 cups and maybe add a smidgen more almond flavoring and dash more sugar. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Really good and easy!  I made mine in an 8"x8" pan.  Haven't tried it with whipped cream or ice cream yet, it's great on it's own! I used only 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup applesauce to make it lower in fat.  I am planning on making it for a party and drizzling a cream cheese type glaze over the top.

This was a real tasty little dessert.  I added golden raisins and a tsp of vanilla along with the almond extract.  I sprinkled the top with course sugar and it came out great and crispy.  My husband was standing behind me with the pie server in his hand when I took it out of the oven.  He ate two pieces before dinner!  We enjoyed this very much. Thanks, Jean!

My family and I thought this was outstanding! It was a wonderful way to use up cranberries I'd had in the freezer. Perfect blend of sweet and just a little tart and not dry at all. Of course this is not a pie, it's a coffee cake. I really want to try this with blueberries next time.

It needed about 5 more minutes in the oven.  It tastes like cranberry and sugar cookie in one.

Excellent recipe!  The texture is thick, somewhere between the consistency of a brownie and cake.  The berries are very tart and go well with the almond recipe.  I was shocked at how easy this was to make!  Easy clean up too.  I'm so glad to have found this!  Thanks!

I did not use the walnuts and added orange zest.  We made this at Christmas and it was a huge hit.  Great tartness from the cranberries - if other fruit were used, it would probably be too sweet, but it was just right with the cranberries.

This is a lovely, simple, flavorful recipe.  It's somewhat like a sweeter scone or a not-too-sweet cake, but, either way, the delicate almond flavor plus plenty of cranberries and walnuts made it a winner in our house.  I'll make it again.

This pie was excellent!  The tartness of the cranberries, the sweetness of the almond extract and sugar all combined together for happiness in your mouth. I served it warm with slow churned ice cream on top.  This dessert was a hit and was all gone, no left overs!  Very easy to make and will definitely make again!

This is very different from my usual desserts.  Here's what I love about it:  I get to use fresh cranberries!  It's a great blend of tart and sweet.  I about 1/4 cup less sugar than it called for. I  used almonds (1/2 cup) instead of the other nuts. While it was good warm from the oven it was GREAT the following day after the cranberries and sugars had really meshed.  Mmmm...it was cake-y and gooey all at the same time.  My husband (who doesn't dig tart) said he would like it with raspberries better.

I made this as well as the layered pumpkin cheesecake from this site for desserts at Thanksgiving this year.  This dessert was sooo festive, and I really like using the fresh cranberries.  I made it exactly as is.  I actually mixed the ingredients earlier in the day, and kept them outside on the porch (my refrigerator was way to full).  Brought the mixture inside and spread it into the pie pan, and put it into the oven to bake as we sat down to dinner.  I think next time I will as sugar crystals to the top to add a little sweetness.  The icecream is a must for this pie, as it cuts the tartness.  I used vanilla and run raisin as suggested....YUM!

This cake came out fabulous.  It was moist with a brownie like texture.  I left my walnuts in bigger pieces rather than finely chopped which made it hearty.  I will definitely make this recipe again! My family preferred it completely cooled rather than hot out of the oven.

I served this for a Thanksgiving dessert buffet.  It was good, but I think more fitting as a Thanksgiving breakfast treat, as it is much more like a coffee cake than a pie.  It is a nice treat for those fans of "not too sweet" because of the tartness of the cranberries.

It's a pretty good recipe.  More like coffee cake than a pie.  Very stiff dough and does not rise much at all.  A bit too greasy for my taste, but my husband and my boss loved it.  Used 1/2 cup flour and 1/2 cup almond meal instead of 1 cup flour, and used vanilla extract instead of almond extract.  I also toasted walnuts before I added to the flour mixture.  The cake is pretty sweet, but I think it's a good balance with tart cranberries.  I baked it for 55 min, and it was still a bit gooey in the center.  Maybe because the batter has so much butter in it?  If I make it again (which I probably will), I will reduce the butter and add applesauce or buttermilk to keep it moist.

As usual I didn't have all of the required ingredients so I improvised.
Instead of flour I used ground almonds.
I didn't have enough butter so added margarine.
And I only had one egg.
The mix was rather stodgy.
I couldn't find the base for my cake tin so I used a square 8-inch cookie tin.
Oh, and I only cooked them for 35 minutes because the oven is a bit dodgy and tends to burn cakes on top.
But the result was lovely.
I ended up with a batch of moist, nutty, cranberry cookies.
I'll be making them again though I'll definitely use only butter next time.
PS  For a nice chocolate torte or chocolate brownies use ground almonds instead of flour as the cake will have a richer flavour and be nicely moist.

If i made it again i'd cook it longer to make sure all the cranberrys are cooked (some were a bit crunchy) and not put in the almond extract.

This recipe is excellent.  I made this a week ago for a dinner party, and at least 6 people asked me for the recipe.  Several commented that they liked it because it wasn't too sweet.  I served it with vanilla ice cream and made the recipe exactly as written.  It is a wonderful, different dessert.

This was so good and so easy!  I used pecans instead of walnuts, because my family likes them better, and it was great.  I really didn't think my husband would like it, because cranberries are not his favorite, but he ate more of it than anyone!  Thank you, Jean.

Wow! This was absolutely delicious! I used fresh raspberries, placing them in the bottom of a quiche dish. Then I mixed up the 'batter' ingredients and poured it over them. Baked as directed. This is a definite keeper! I also used vanilla extract and added a little cinnamon to the batter.  We all loved it!

I made this exactly as directed, using fresh whole cranberries. The almond extract gives it a delicious aroma reminiscent of sugar cookie dough. It's like eating a slice of cookie with walnuts & plump cranberries and the appearance is gorgeous with the red cranberries- perfect to bring to a holiday party. Very nice flavor and appearance.

I love this cake, but you have to REALLY like cranberries to enjoy it!  Maybe consider using fewer cranberries if you're looking to please a wide audience.  I brought 3 of them to a tailgate and it was a smash hit.  Will make it again.

This is so simple to make and delicious.  I don't like almond extract, so I use vanilla instead.  Plus I add a teaspoon or so of cinnamon.  It tastes fantastic this way.  I also once made a variation of this using summer berries, and again, it was very tasty.

This came together very quickly--really easy to make and a nice change of pace from more traditional desserts. It's kind of like a cranberry and almond brownie texture-wise. I used frozen cranberries, so it took an additional 5-10 minutes to bake completely. The almond extract adds a nice dimension to this dessert. Next time, I might try adding orange zest or a teaspoon of orange extract. I'd call this Cranberry Not-Really-a-Pie Pie. ;)

This was better than I thought it would be! I did as some had suggested and used 1/2 tsp almond extract and 1/2 tsp vanilla extract. It had a nice almond taste. This is just the right amount of sweetness. It is as good warm as room temperature. My husband and brother who was visiting both gave it a definite thumbs up!

I made it as a Christmas gift for my neighbors (4) and they all loved it and have asked for the recipe. 
Took it with me on a visit to my brother and he has made it 3 times. It has become a family favorite.

I’ve made this several times.  Both with regular and gluten free flour.  Turns out great.  Love it with a little lemon glaze too.

I made this twice.  Once for dessert for a dinner with guests.  Everyone loved it!  The other time I made it for a Christmas pot luck at church. I made it in a square pan so I could cut it up in small pieces for serving. Several people asked for recipe.  That's a sure indication it was a hit.

I loved this recipe! Made it for a potluck, the only thing I changed was 1/2 tsp almond extract and 1/2 tsp vanilla. Everyone raved about it, I made it again doubling the recipe for a Christmas hayride party and it was a hit! You do need to bake it longer than 40 minutes as it is quite dense. Very delicious and unique!

I added zest of 1 orange and omitted nuts. I wanted to eat the whole pan but managed to share some with the kids and they all loved it too! Loved the tangy cranberries.

Brought this to a small group book study and it was a huge success! Everybody wanted the recipe. I love it because it's so simple to make and not overly sweet. The only adjustment I made was I used one cup of chopped nuts instead of a half cup.

Yum, yum, yum!  Tart, sweet, tart, sweet with a wonderful dose of almond flavor.  I accidentally grabbed pecans instead of walnuts and it was soooo good!  Must love cranberries to love this, but we do, so .... LOVE!

I've made this pie lots of  times ( I live where there is an abundance of cranberries) and each time it's a hit.  I've also baked the recipe in a muffin pan and called them cranberry walnuts treats.  The recipe makes a dozen and I always threatened to freeze them, but they don't last long enough.  Kids love them.  A great recipe to travel to a party when you're asked to bring dessert.   Thanks  for posting it.

This is SO delicious! I know this says to serve warm-we tried it straight out of the oven and it was so sour we were disappointed, but as it cools something magical happens; Perfectly sweet-tart! Fast and easy to make too. We have a walnut allergy in our home so slivered almonds were substituted. OMGosh... I have to stop eating this!

This is one of my very favorite recipes.  My aunt used to make this when I was little and now I make it each year.  I love the tart and sweet.  We eat it for dessert or for breakfast with our coffee, because why not!

Excellent and easy to convert to gluten free! I subbed with 1 cup Better Batter All Purpose Flour Mix.  My husband, who is not GF, enjoyed this dessert and said no one would ever know! Both of us enjoyed the combo of sweet and tartness with this recipe. Since I used chopped almonds (what I had on hand), I used 1/2 tsp Almond and 1/2 tsp Vanilla extract. I baked for an extra 7-10 minutes, but I did use thawed cranberries (i.e. they were frozen and then thawed) and it could be due to an oven variance. If you use frozen, it's likely your bake time will be longer as well. Next time I'll try with fresh, not frozen/thawed berries. Thank you for this recipe!  Looking forward to making it again!

This is one of the best recipes I've found on this site. It is not a pie at all. The consistency is a bit like a torte, or a brownie. It's a bit chewy. Absolutely divine. If you like almond flavor, and especially marzipan, you will LOVE this in both flavor and consistency.

I am dumbstruck at people who rated this recipe and then said, "I didn't use the almond extract." OK, maybe it was good your way too, but it is NOT the same dessert AT ALL. The almond is what makes this dessert what it is. Don't sub it for vanilla. Just make the thing as is!

I used frozen cranberries and it went great. This is a really easy recipe. The batter is very thick, so just stir with a sturdy wooden spoon, and don't over-mix. Follow the directions and you will not go wrong.

This was delicious. I used 1 1/2 c. of cranberries per suggestions from other reviews. I actually would have liked more, so next time I will use 2 cups. I made a streusel topping with cinnamon. After it cooled, I drizzled a capful of bourbon on top of the piece I was eating. It wasn't overpowering and went well with the sweet, tartness of the "coffee cake."  It's easy to make, and it's a great way to get the nutritional benefits of cranberries. Did you know cranberries are choke full of vitamin K??! I didn't either.

This was a really easy recipe. I wanted to make something with cranberries as dessert for Thanksgiving. Its a little bit too tart for me personally so next time I will coat the cranberries in the sugar before adding flour. I glazed it with hardened homemade vanilla icing to add a bit more sweetness and topped it off with  vanilla icream. 
Update: My boyfriend LOVED it. Said its the best pie he ever had and he's from Southern Ohio...lol

This is one of my 'go to' recipes! I've made this for many years, and it gets raves. It's very good as written, but as we do with recipes we make for years, I have tweaked it.
I add a little more of the cranberries, and ALWAYS cut them in half. That way, the sugar and goodness gets in them.  I tried saving time  by putting them in the food processor and the flavor evened out to evenly sweet, it didn't have the pop-ups of tangy fruitiness. So I take the time to cut them in 1/2. 
Also, I up the almond extract to 3 teaspoons, yum!
Fresh or frozen cranberries, it doesn't matter. Frozen cranberries make the mixture very thick, but it comes out the same.  Also, I bake the pie  about  10 minutes more than called for, since the middle doesn't get done in my oven. Watch temperature, though, and don't overcook. The texture loses it's tenderness. It's always excellent served warm with a bit of vanilla ice cream!
One last tip, I often make two pies at once, and once cooled, tightly cover one and freeze it for the next event. I thaw it, warm it, and it's as good as fresh. When I make 2 pies, I add one extra egg to the mixture.

This was SO easy. I just didn't think that the cranberries would get enough sweetness to offset their tartness. I was wrong. It was perfect.

Made it tonight. The only changes I made was I used pecans bec it's all I had and I used 1/4 tsp almond extract and 3/4 tsp vanilla. I used fresh cranberries. It seriously only took 5 min to mix up and 45 min to bake in my oven.  It is the perfect balance of sweet and tart. The cranberries pop in your mouth and then the sweetness of the "cake" follows. It is a light sweet, not cloying at all. Next time I may up the almond extract to 1/2 tsp but I do think a whole tsp would be overpowering. It is husband approved. Not only will I make this again but I'm making it for thanksgiving.  Thank you for the recipe!  It's a keeper

Super tasty and light desert.  Have made it several times.  Add 3/4 cup of sugar instead of full cup as it is too sweet.  Also, add coconut for some add texture and taste.

Made this the other day and it is excellent! I did cut back on the almond extract (1/2 teas.) and added 1/2 teas. vanilla. I am going to try it with other fruit such as blueberries. Made it in my cast iron skillet and it gave it a great crust on the bottom.

A great thing to make for Christmas brunch.  Looks festive, cooks up easy, hard to go wrong.  I adjusted the almond extract down a bit and added vanilla (because most baked goods taste better with vanilla). I've made it twice this holiday season and will make again.

I'm updating my review: a year has passed, and this is by far the most requested dessert/ breakfast cake in our house. At the store today, one kid stocked up on bags of fresh cranberries so he'd be sure to have the ingredients on hand. Still following the recipe (though without the nuts, so the kids can take it to school.)
----------------------------------

We love this (though my 12 year olds will finish an entire recipe themselves if given the opportunity). I've made it twice (baked it once in a cast iron pan, once in glass; once with all purpose flour, once with whole wheat), and it disappeared both times within 15 minutes of coming out of the oven. 
With the frozen berries, I put half in the prepared pan, poured the filling over it, then pressed the other half of the berries into the top: no problems with the mixture getting too thick. I did sprinkle the top with coarse sugar (but that's the only real change I made.) Anything that my kids will eat with this level of enthusiasm is a winner!

WOW! This "pie" is more like a moist dense cake. But my OH my... it is excellent! My very picky spouse even loved this treat.

This is a very flexible recipe. I substitute Vanilla with diffferent types of nutes and have used multiple other fruits like diced apples, crushed oranges, strawberries and blueberries. Its simple and satisfies that sweet tooth. Its also wonderful for fruit that needs to be used up!

I really wanted to try this recipe as written but I couldn't find my almond extract to save my life.  So I had to change it, but I don't think my changes mattered.  Instead of the almond extract I used 1/2 tsp. orange extract, 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract and about 1 tsp. fresh orange zest.  Oh my goodness!  This was so good! My husband raved over it and said we should have this instead of other pies at Christmas dinner. It goes great with coffee the next morning.  Cake for breakfast!

Five stars for simplicity and 10 for deliciousness!  I made this last Christmas morning, with hot coffee, to nosh on while opening gifts. It was requested again this year! 
The only changes I made (because of nut allergies), I replaced the walnuts with toasted sunflower seeds, for a bit of crunch,  and I used orange extract instead of the almond.  When it came hot from the oven I drizzled it with orange glaze.  Wonderful recipe!

So I made this pie yesterday with high hopes from all the reviews. I made it exactly as instructed. With the exception of substituting walnuts for almonds. And doing 3/4 tsp vanilla extract and 1/4 tsp almond. I had to let it bake longer than 40 mins. More like 50 mins. Once ready I let it cool and tasted.... The whole pie was  stuck to my pie pan so I couldn't get the nice slice like the picture. The taste is OK I think if I try it again I'll do less cranberries. I was so upset it all stuck to the pan. Hopefully next time I'll have better luck

This is fabulous! My first bite, while still warm, was "hmmm this is interesting!"  My second bite was "this is good!"  My third bite was "OMG this is wonderful". You don't need to change anything. The recipe is excellent as written. Yes, it has a tart and sweet and almond-y flavor.  However it's not TOO much of any one of those. It's very well balanced as written. I did sprinkle the dough with a bit of demarra sugar before baking. I also took the advice of another reviewer and saved a few cranberries to press part way down into the dough so their juices would run on top of the "pie". It is more of a brownie like texture.

My family loved this! It has become a new staple of our Thanksgiving and Christmas Dinners.  It is easy to make and keeps well in the fridge. I did adjust the ingredients to be able to use the whole package of 3 cups of cranberries, rather than the 2 cups called for in the original recipe.

Made this exactly as per the recipe - except that I forgot the nuts.  The almond extract was not overpowering, it was perfect.  I made this to serve 45 people, everyone of whom  totally enjoyed every bite.  I'll be making it again for 150 people at our Seniors' Centre Christmas dinner. I'll probably used toasted almonds or pecans instead of walnuts.  And I'll put a dollop of whipped cream on the plate. This dessert is a winner - thank you to Jean, the poster.

Made it the first time following the recipe exactly and it came out pretty good.  The second time I increased the walnuts to 1 cup and substituted vanilla instead of almond extract.  I then poured the batter into a CRUST made of 1 pack crushed grahams, 1/2 c chopped walnuts, 2 TB brown sugar, 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 c melted butter pressed into a spring form pan.  I also slightly undercooked the recipe so that the interior was more like a fudgy blondie than "a clean wooden pick".  After cooling, the pie sets up nicely and can be easily released from the pan.  Also, I use frozen cranberries for this recipe.  They stiffen up the raw batter quite a bit but the end result remains the same - awesome every time!

This was very good. I didn't use a pie pan because I only had a giant 10 inch deep dish thing and since I wasn't making a double recipe to fill it I just used a square baking pan (I think I used 8 inch) and it came out perfectly. I think maybe next time I may toss my frozen cranberries into my melted butter to defrost them slightly, or even let them thaw a bit on the counter before adding them, which may make combining the doughy batter a little easier. I also added maybe a heaping half cup of fresh blueberries in place of some of the cranberries and that was very tasty. I love this for when I'm craving that sweet almond extract flavour. My better half liked it too! Very much a brownie-ish texture... can't wait to make this again! I think combining canberries with another berry yielded the best results for me. I'll be stocking up on cranberries when the season hits so I can keep making this all year!

It was simple and easy to make.  It has the texture of a coffee cake or something like it.  It was very good served warm with your morning coffee.  The cranberries were tart so it has that sweet/tart contrast.  Overall a 3 1/2 star rating based on how easy it is to make and overall taste.  Two days later it is still here though.  Other pies/ desserts are long gone!

Easier than pie! Tart and tasty! Loved this, and it was so easy too. Made this the first time per the recipe except I did a streusel topping with brown sugar, butter, walnuts, and placed the remainder of my 12 oz bag of cranberries on top. FYI, one 12 oz. bag of cranberries will give you 2 cups plus extra for the top, even after picking out bad ones. Making it the second time the same way minus the butter on top, and instead of walnuts, using a 2.25 (2/3 c bag) of almonds which is enough for the inside and top. My boyfriend ate seconds, even though he looked at it funny at first. Can't wait to bring it to work.

Great recipe! Due to egg allergies, I substituted flaxseed/water. Also, followed a suggestion to use 1/4 tsp almond and 3/4 tsp vanilla flavorings.  It came out great with my egg substitute and I loved the subtle almond. I'm thinking this could work for a brunch too. Can't wait to try this with a blueberry and lemon combo. Eating the last piece today!

I used 3/4 cup of sugar and equivalent of 1/2 cup of Stevia.  Next time I think I'll try 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of applesauce.  I have substituted applesauce for oil in recipes before and have liked the results.  I have made this dessert a couple of different times now, and my guests have always asked for the recipe.

Because my wife has celiac, I substituted the flour with a cup of gluten-free all purpose flour. I normally wouldn't make such a direct switch but since the flour is mixed in as opposed to as a separate crust I was wiling to give it a try. Success! Everyone loved it! Also a great use of cranberries if you have some left over for after Thanksgiving.

Adapted this recipe to my son's food intolerances and the whole family ate it and liked it. Used gluten free all purpose flour instead of wheat flour, light olive oil instead of melted butter, dextrose instead of  white sugar and no almond extract, and this was good! More like a crumble than a pie, but still good. I know this is not he original recipe I am rating, but the original was the inspiration and for those of you dealing with food intolerance issues, maybe this will be helpful. Thanks!

Absolutely wonderful and so festive looking!  After reading comments, I used 1/2 tsp. almond extract and 1/2 tsp. vanilla.  Also, I put a handful of cranberries on top just before baking so they pop open and make a better presentation.  So easy and delish!!!

I wanted to make this recipe but only had frozen blackberries.  So I tried it and left out the walnuts--it is amazing.  So good I will continue to experiment with other berries, including cranberries!  Thank you for the recipe!

Very good! I used almonds because I thought they would go better with the almond flavoring and it was so good. Sort of like a cranberry nut muffin. I will definitely make it again!

I followed this recipe to the letter and it turned out great. My neighbors loved it and I will make it for Thanksgiving. I can see how this would be a great base recipe with all kinds of substitution possibilities such as blueberries, chocolate chips, pecans, etc. It’s very easy to put together and probably freezes great. You could easily put this together and put it in the oven as soon as the turkey comes out to serve with ice cream for dessert.

Since Canadian Thanksgiving, I have made this 3 times!  Wow!  I sprinkled with icing sugar.  I wonder if it can be made with other seasonal fruits...  Its a keeper.

This pie is awesome!  It is easy to make and simply delicious.  I took a picture of the pie and put it up on my FB page and several of my friends have asked for the recipe.  I will definitely make more of these wonderful pies.  One note:  I am not a baker, and this was the first pie I ever made!

I agree this isn't exactly a pie, but omigosh is it ever good. My hubby doesn't care for cranberries but he loved this dessert. I just sprinkled coarse sugar on top, for a pretty presentation.

This is the best and easiest recipe ever! The combination of the cranberries and almond is fabulous. I made this last year for Thanksgiving and it was the only dessert to disappear. My husband requested another when we got home. I also made it for a food day at work and it was a hit. I am so happy that I stumbled across this recipe. It gets 5 stars in my book!!

We like this even better with just one small change.  We use just 1/2 tsp Almond Extract as well as 1/2 tsp Vanilla.  Yum!

This recipe was a total hit!  I actually made it just to use up some cranberries we had on hand--it's so simple and quick, and my guests loved it!  The tart is great with cool whip on top.  A note, though, you may go a little lighter on the cranberries the first time if you think you may be overwhelmed by the tartiness.  We made it with about half the quantity last time, which my husband preferred, but I would've enjoyed a little more.

I made this recipe with the addition of the struessel topping that another reviewer suggested. I can't say enough good things about it! Everyone loves it & I always have people ask for the recipe. I would call it a coffee cake, more than a pie though.

YUMMY!  This recipe is perfect as written.  I love cranberries and this pie was a delicious (and easy) choice!  I might increase the almond extract next time just because I love that flavor.  I can't wait to make it again!!

Absolutely loved it! I had no almond extract (it was christmas eve and they were all out at the grocery store), so I did a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Tasted fine to me. What was weird was that this pie tasted better after a day or longer!  You could taste a difference, and I liked it the next day better than the day I made it. Make this pie! YOu will be happy you did.

This is more of a cake than pie, in my opinion. Myself and family enjoyed this. I did as others suggested only using 1/4 tsp. almond extract with 3/4 tsp vanilla. Next time I make this I will add some orange zest. Very good recipe!

I followed recipe exactly except I cut the almond extract down to 1/2 t and used 1 t vanilla; even with that modification, the almond flavor was very strong. I also pressed a handful of cranberries into the top of the pie before baking and sprinkled with brown sugar; the sugar melted creating a slight crispy caramel glaze. Everyone at our family party liked it, and it was very easy to make and looked festive.

Loved this!  I definitely recommend it if you like desserts which aren't super sweet. This was also quite tart.  I did make a few changes. I'm not a big almond extract fan so I used vanilla instead. I added the zest of an orange and didn't have any walnuts on hand. I loved it so much I can't imagine nuts would make it any better.  I'll be making this one again. Super easy and delicious!

The combination of almond and cranberry is wonderful! I think next time I make this, I will use chopped almonds rather than walnuts to further reinforce this pair. Very easy recipe to make up.

Ok folks, can you say "Tarty, nutty and simply delicious?" Than this unique dessert will not disappoint you. I make this wonderful dessert to compliment the Amish Breakfast Casserole (from this website) every holiday for my family and I always get smiles all around! I do tweak it a little bit by 1) sub roasted, crushed Almonds vs walnuts (which we prefer the taste) 2) dec almond extract to 3/4 tsp w/1/4 tsp vanilla extract and 3) made a brown sugar/almond strusel topping of: 1/4 cup crushed almonds, pinch of sea salt, 1/3 cup brown sugar, 2 tablespoons butter and 2 tablespoons flour mixed together. Again, it is a unique dessert that pairs up with a rich casserole/main dish. Oh, and don't forget the vanilla ice cream on top..delicious!

LOVE this recipe!  Followed some of the suggestions of others by using almond extract for the vanilla & almonds instead of walnuts.  I also put the cranberries in the food processor and pulsed them just a little. The look is really festive. Then I used 1/2 package of cream cheese, 1 1/2 c confectioners sugar and 1/8t almond extract and made a tasty streusel for the top.  DELICOUS!  Thanks for this excellent recipe.

This was,  by all accounts, good but not exceptional. I did as others did and used 3/4 tsp of vanilla and 1/4 tsp of almond extract. Otherwise made as written. I did not make the streusel topping but maybe I should have. It was very easy to make and looked pretty.

This was absolutely wonderful.  I did alter it a bit. Since I am not an almond extract fan I substituted it for 1 capful of orange extract. Wow! I love the flavors of cranberry and orange. There was just a hint of orange which was good but next time I may up the orange extract up to 2 capfuls.

What a pleasant surprise this recipe was. I love cranberries. The only time you see fresh cranberries is during the Holidays but you can find them in the frozen food section the year round. I only use 3/4 cup of flour. The first time I made it, per the recipe, it came out a little dry and stiff. It comes out softer and juicier for me with less flour. Everyone who try's it loves it.

Love this, doubled the recipe and it was gone in a day.  Swapped the cranberries with fresh Rhubarb and that was great as well.  It makes a lovely presentation.

I made it twice in the past three days, using spelt flour. The first one was with frozen cranberries, and it was just great! Today I added some mixed forest fruits (frozen again) and it was still delicious, but I like the cranberry version better.

This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This is...odd.  But in a really, really good way.  I used pecans instead of walnuts just because although I KNOW I have walnuts in the freezer, I could not find them!  Also, I used half a teaspoon almond extract and half a teaspoon vanilla.  Otherwise, I kept it the same, and tossed a couple extra cranberries on the top.  It is tart and sweet...just very delicious.  And it couldn't be easier.  My boyfriend and I each went back for a second slice, and he is thinking about a third.  I think it would be lovely after a heavy holiday meal :)

Very good. Even better cold for breakfast the next day.  Note: almond extract is powerful stuff!  My son, who loves cranberries, thought that this could use a bit less sugar.  He enjoys the tart flavor.  I thought that the sugar was ok but a little less would be fine by me.  I'll definitely make again.

Amazingly delicious!! And very simple. I substituted pecans for the walnuts (not a walnut fan) and added 3 dashes of cinnamon, and used in season, freshly picked, locally grown cranberries.
Will be making this to share for the holidays!

This is one of the best "on hand" recipes I have ever come across.  So easy to throw together.  I have also used rhubarb instead of the cranberries, which is eqully delicious!!

I made this with whole wheat flour, raw sugar, orange zest, blueberries and raspberries, and did half and half maple and vanillia extract.  Excellent!  Topped with a little fresh butter or yogurt.  Mhhhhmmmmm.  Thank you:)

Added zest from one orange, and replaced 3/4 tsp of the almond extract with vanilla so the almond wouldn't be overpowering.  Very popular with the kids!

Made this wonderful dessert with gluten free flour and it was so good I have made it once a week for the last couple months.  Moist. Slightly tart. Walnut accent.  It's a delight to smell while baking and a gem to serve.

Made this yesterday for family and everyone loved it.  I made a batch and half because I wanted to use a whole package of cranberries then I baked in a cake pan.  I thought it was even better cold this morning with coffee.

Super easy! I had more like 2 1/2 cups of cranberries that I had to use, so I added a bit more flour and a bit of milk to bind it all together. After it cooled I drizzled just a little icing over the whole thing, looked really nice. The kids loved it, will definitely be making again!

This recipe is GREAT!  It takes no time to prepare and a short time to bake.  I made it for a dinner with my in-laws and it was a huge hit.  Just the right tartness and sweetness!  I wouldn't change a thing.....

I have been making this recipe for a few years now - it is always a hit! In fact, I buy a huge bag of cranberries and freeze in 2 c. bags so that I have fresh cranberries to use throughout the year.

There are a few changes I've made depending on the time of year. In summer, I use chopped, slivered blanched almonds and lemon extract in place of the nuts and almond extract. The tart lemon + cranberries make for a cool and refreshing treat with ice cream on the side. 
We also substitute pecans for the walnuts just because of preference - still delicious! 
Oh, it's perfect for breakfast, too. :) Enjoy!

This was AMAZING!  I used heaping cups of cranberries, half whole wheat flour, and cut the sugar by about 2 TBS.  Wow, could not get enough!  Pretty enough to take to a potluck as well.

This is a good recipe. My only issue is that the cranberries are still very tart at the end. Next time I might try chopping them and using a little less. I added cinnamon and nutmeg, and substituted the almond extract for vanilla and imitation rum flavor because that's what we had. I sprinkled just straight brown sugar on top before baking, and it came out with a kind of candy-ish crust, which I liked. My family ate the whole thing in one day, and I made another one to get rid of some left over cranberries from thanksgiving, and it's already half gone. So it was a hit.

This recipe is easy, has great flavor, and very appealing to the eye. I however don't think it resembles pie at all. I made mine in a 8x8 pan, and put an orange glaze over the top. It was more like a bar. The orange adds a great dimension to it. Thank you for sharing :)

I enjoyed this recipe. Like some said its more like a coffee cake.  Also, I've read some reviews and for those who think its too tart remember these are cranberries they are naturally tart.  I warmed mine up in the morning and added a little heavy cream over the top yum.  Oh, I also added 1/4c walnuts and 1/4c pecans.  Thanks

FANTASTIC (with revisions)
I made this pie with the revisions suggested (streusel topping w/cinnamon) and 1/4 tsp. almond extract + 3/4 tsp vanilla. The pie was a little gooey in the center after 40 minutes but still tasted good, the next day, it firmed up a bit and was moist with a texture that reminded me a little of marzipan (maybe the almond flavor helped that). The batter is extremely thick - like spreading cookie dough - but do not worry, it turns out amazing. My husband RAVED about it and my son who refused to eat it the first night (because he "hates cranberries") finally tried it and begged me to make it again since he had missed out on it. The neighbor inhaled some as well. I will be making this EVERY cranberry season. I have never had a pie quite like it and I LOVE it!! Try it with the revisions and you will not be sorry. I'm taking it to my next pot luck...

Love this- warm is wonderful; cold is great too.  All the tart of cranberries with the succulent sweet bread like cake/pie.  I will definitely make this for thanksgiving with the family.  I did make a brown sugar/almond/flour/butter strudel which added crunch and depth.

This is a favorite recipe...I double it and cook it in a larger square or rectangle pan...can't figure out why it is called "pie" because it is more like a coffee cake.

Thanks for the easy recipe!  To meet gluten free, no sugar needs of our group, I used 1/2 c. brown sugar Splenda instead of white and 1/2 c. rice flour and 1/2 c. oatmeal flour for the all purpose.  To go with the almond extract, I used chopped almonds. YUM!

Good, but tart.  I would definitely call this more of a coffee cake than pie.  I know some people baked this in a square pan which I think I would do if I baked this again.  It just doesn't seem right to have "cake" in a pie pan!  The cranberries I had were fairly large so that could have contributed to the tartness.  I did serve this with spray on whipped cream which helped.  I think it would be great with vanilla ice cream though I didn't have any.  I would suggest if you have larger cranberries that you cut them in half as some reviewers have.  If you don't have whipped cream or ice cream you may want to take others advice and add a streusel type topping.

This was pretty good.  I think it may have needed a little more flour as it was more dense and not very fluffy like the picture.  I also used the strudel topping that other suggested to help cut down on some of the tart flavoring.

This was good!  Used up the leftover cranberries.  I thought it could have used some icing since the cranberries were so tart but it was fine without.  I baked in a square 8x8 pan so it was more like a coffeecake.  Thanks!

This is a great dessert: not too sweet, not too heavy. The tartness of the cranberries combined with the crunchiness of the nuts and the almond flavouring produce a wonderful taste and texture. I used frozen cranberries and found it needed close to *60 minutes* to bake.

This is the first review I have ever written. I have made this pie 3 times this year and always get requests for it. I have actually only tasted it once because it is always the first dessert gone by the time I try to get a piece. I made it exactly as directed, the only thing I did was cut a few of the larger cranberries in half, and everyone seems to love it. If you are looking for something different to serve instead of a regular cake or pie, this is definitely it. And the best part is, it only takes a few minutes to make.

Definitely a texture of a "bread" but excellent.  I did make a glaze out of amaretto and water, and it made it an excellent dessert.

This is so easy and so tasty!  I didn't really know what to expect, but I didn't expect it to taste so good!  The first time I tried it, I didn't really care for the almond extract and I had pecans on hand, so that's what I used.  It was good.  But, I made it better.  The second time I made this, I used vanilla extract in place of the almond, used pecans again, and made a topping with more chopped pecans and brown sugar.  I baked it in a 9x9 casserole dish instead of the pie dish.  Perfection!  I was suprised at the nice balance of sweet and tart.  I had to bake another the very next day because my family devoured it in a matter of hours!

Drooool. Excellently tart pie. Unbelivably easy to make. Mix all ingridients together, through in a pie pan, and presto...40 min later a scrumptious pie/cake like concoction. DO sprinkle brown sugar and extra walnuts on top. AND DO serve with fat free cool whip (to cut down on calories). This pie is good warm or cold. Let the raves continue.

Just made this for the first time and I will be making it again for our Thanksgiving dinner.  I didn't make any changes and it turned out perfect. This was the first time I have used fresh cranberries and was a bit leary about how it would turn out.  It is a little tart, but I expected that.  A little whipped cream or ice cream is perfect to off set that.

07/25/12-Made this again using 3 medium peaches peeled and cut into bite sized pieces plus used 1/2 cup ground, blanched almonds instead of the walnuts, it was spectacular!  The perfect peach summer cake.
This was very tasty.  I made it exactly as written. It is more of a coffee cake than a pie.  If I make it again, I'll make it in an 8-inch square pan and put an almond streusel on top before baking it.

I found this recipe on this site a few years ago. I serve it every Christmas morning with fresh fruit while we open our gifts. Not a crumb left and this way we don't eat a heavy breakfast. Don't change a thing except make it with unfroze cranberries as too hard to mix with frozen,

Very good play of sweet and bursts of bright tart cranberries.  Used fresh berries, and added a streusel topping.  Easy peasy, and company special.

Delicious!!!  I had a taste at all stages of completion (ie., hot, warm, cool, cold)  and each stage was terrific!! After it's been refrigerated, it's a spoonful of greatness whenever you want it!  I did need to cook it longer than the recipe.

Very good and a different way to use cranberries.  My kids liked it but didn't like the nuts even though I tried to crush them finely they still realized that they were there.  I substituted white whole wheat flour for the all purpose and 1/4 cup of the butter for unsweetened applesauce.  It still turned out great.  Definitely a keeper!

I punched this up by adding a melted milk chocolate topping (also to mask the unappealing plain top) The sweet chocolate balanced the tartness of the cranberry wonderfully. It was a huge hit!

My daughter loves this & requests it regularly!  I bake it in a square pan and it's more like a tea bread than a pie.  Sometimes I make it as written and other times I omit the nuts.  Great either way.  Also good with chocolate chips or white chocolate chips.  A keeper!!

Awesome!  Made it for Christmas Eve and ended up eating the whole thing myself:)  It reminded me of my moms cranberry bread that she made when I was a kid.  I loved it with the almond extract but will try with orange extract next time.

I love this pie!  It really has a great flavor and I don't like cranberries that much  - it reminds me of cherry pie.  I used vanilla instead of almond extract.  My 87 yr. old Mom liked it too and she's an expert pie maker.

I made this for the first time this Thanksgiving and it will definitely be made again! The tartness from the cranberries works very well with the sweet filling, and the almond extract, in my opinion, is the perfect addition. Again, it is much like a cake, but who really cares? It's so good. I love the previous reviewer's comment - cranberry crack. It's that addictive!

Very good. Seems even better the day after, next time I'll make it a day ahead. I may also see if I can get away with reducing the amout of butter a wee bit. Could easily be served in an 8 X 8 pan, was great with whipped cream. Nice job, Jean.

i agree with previous reviewers -- it is more of a cake in a pie plate.  nonetheless, it looks pretty, it is easy to make and it tastes delicious.

I Loved this =] Before i put it in the oven I tasted the batter & it was great, but after tasting the cranberries, i was a bit skeptical because they were extremely tart, bt after cooking the pie (with the addition of 1/2 tsp cinnamon & a streusel topping from baked leftover cake crumbs) it was great! it reminded me of a the "plum tart" or "blueberry buckle" recipes on this site. The only problem I encountered was the cooking time, mine was still kinda jiggly in the middle after 40 minutes so im putting it in there for another 10min at 300 degrees.

Everytime I have made this I have been asked for the recipe.  Not to mention not a crumb left on anyone's plate.  IThe first time I made it was on Christmas day for those who do not like Christmas pud.  Most people had both!

Sooo yummy!  I love the tartness of cranberries and this "pie" (really cake) is the perfect balance.  I used a 12 oz. pkg of fresh cranberries that I had frozen when I didn't use them, so it may have been more than 2 cups, I didn't measure them.

I love this recipe, so versatile.  I usually squeeze a little fresh orange juice into the batter and add a little rind when I make it with cranberries.  I made it today with fresh strawberries and chopped almonds....deeeeelish!

The "pie" itself if super- loved the flavor. My only complaint was that the cranberries were so tart they just didnt go well with the batter. I will use blueberries next time and I think it will be a super combo. You cant ask for a simpler unusual desert.

More like a sweet & tart coffee cake! Made a few changes...used all whole wheat pastry flour, frozen cranberries, half almonds/half walnuts, orange zest, Smart Balance, and added a splash of soy milk because the batter was too dry when mixing. Served with soy vanilla ice cream. The pie was drier on the bottom and sides, but the cranberries floated to the top and center, which was very moist.

this is the easiest recipe ever!  i couldn't get cranberries so i substituted raspberries and it was great.  i've also used bananas and my family just raved about it.  my sister accidentally used self rising flour and said it made a more traditional thick fluffy banana bread...i can't wait to try it with peaches...i'm not a very dedicated cook so i wouldn't use this recipe if it wasn't so easy...this is a definite keeper..i've had at least a dozen people at my office and in my family ask for the recipe...it makes me seem like i know what i'm doing in the kitchen...ha!ha!

Very good. This is a berry coffe cake.  Not sure why it's called a pie just because it's baked in a pie dish.  The cake comes out moist and the ingredient proportions are just right. I made it with almond extract but it was too strong. I switched to vanilla extract and it was much tastier.  I've also made this with frozen blackberries and it turned out great.  This is a quick coffee cake to make when you're in a pinch, great for dessert or brunch.  It's also great the next day too and stays moist.

I've made this twice in a month and both times it was gone in no time!  The first time I made it as written, the second time I used 1 cup of d'anjou pears and 1 cup of cranberries.  I can see there are many variations on this pie, and I expect I'll be making them for a year.

A nice cake that uses up cranberries. I recommend to de-frost your cranberries if you use frozen (I was impatient and didn't bother to) because the batter is really thick and hard to spread if you don't. Nice recipe! Quick, easy and tasty.

Mmmmmm... this pie is so good!  I subbed almond meal for walnuts (because of allergies) and did half vanilla / half almond extract. The almond meal adds a lovely texture to the pie.  When served as a cold wedge, this pie is like fruit cake- but good. Thanks for the delicious recipe!

I took this to a holiday party - and boy did I get wows!  The only change I made was to use sliced almonds instead of walnuts.  I served this with warm vanilla sauce (as given with the Bread Pudding recipe on this site).  Party guests raved, and a normally polite crowd fought over seconds.

Wonderful recipe.  I used 1/4 tsp almond extract and 1 tsp orange extract, and always use toasted, chopped hazelnuts.  I have used a 9x9 Corningware dish, baked at 325 degrees for nine additional minutes, and doubled the recipe using a single layer 9x13 pan on 350 for about 45 minutes, turning the oven off and letting the cake continue to warm for additional 8 minutes before removing it from the oven to cool.  It was useful to spray the pans with a nonstick spray and dust with sugar.  Great with coffee in the morning, tea at four, whipped cream at midnight!

my plan is to do this for Christmas am to go with breakfast. I tried it ahead of time as a test run. I only had blueberries and sliced almonds on hand. Both went well with the almond extract, and used a bit of lemon zest as someone else had mentioned. I sprinkled a bit of brownsugar and almonds on top for nice streusel effect. It was amazing, we had it for breakfast with coffee, then heated with vanilla icecream for dessert that evening. Will do 1cp blueberries and 1 cp cranberries with chopped pecans, for Christmas. LOVE THIS RECIPE, it was thrown together in 5 minutes. will make this many times.

Excellent recipe as-is.  It reminds me a bit of a slightly tart fruitcake.  I thought the flavor improved a bit after a day or two in the refrigerator.

Wonderful, not too sweet coffee cake.  Brought to work, and everyone loved it!  I particularly enjoyed the large quantity of tart cranberries, set off by the mildly sweet cake.  The only trick, was that mine was difficult to cut and serve from my pie pan.  Next time, I will probably use an 8x8 square pan...but other than that, this recipe was a keeper!

Made exactly as recipe (despite the other reviews) and it came out wonderfully. However, I WAS the only one to really like it, as everyone else thought the cranberries were too tart a taste. I WILL make this again using blueberries as the almond pudding was absolutely delicious! Thanks for sharing.

I made this today and used cherries instead of the cranberries.  Added about 1/8 or 1/4 c. mini chocolate chips and reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup.  It is delicious and very quick and easy.  Can't wait to have it with coffee this weekend!

LOVE IT! DID a few alterations though I doubled the batch and put it in a 9x13 pan cut the butter down to 3/4 cup and the sugar down to 1&1/2 cups. I then used the remaining 1/4 cup butter 1/2 cup brown sugar and a 2 heaping spoonfuls of flour to make a crumb topping. EVERYONE LOVED IT. went in minutes.

Very easy and tasted great! My daughter doesn't like nuts, so I substituted them with 2 oz. of cut-up bittersweet chocolate, then cut back on the sugar a little. Be aware that this really tastes like a cake not a pie.

I made this recipe just this afternoon and loved it instantly.  I followed the recipe to a "T", but next time will add a little vanilla extract.  Wonder if chocolate chips would would be nice as well?

I've made this twice-in an 8x8 pan and 9x13-put the butter, brown sugar & nut topping that was suggested and it is a great coffee cake. I make it a day ahead of time because the cranberries are better if they blend

This pie is delicious!  I made a few tweaks when I made it - I'm allergic to walnuts, so I added almonds - I figured they would work well since there was almond extract in the orginal recipe.  I also added some golden raisins that I had soaked in hot water for a short time.  The pie turned out great!  It is even good cold the next day with coffee - I am sure I will make this again and again, and will probably try it next time with no nuts at all!  Great dessert - with many options - it would work wonderfully at brunch with coffee and eggs! Yum!

I thought this was fantastic -- made it for a dinner party last night, kept with the recipe except I did substitute vanilla extract for the almond extract. The amount of cranberries was just right -- this dessert is perfect for those that like a little "tart" in their dessert, still plenty sweet though, really good!

This was unusual, but good. It's very tangy and tart, and then has a hint of sweet. It doesn't taste like pie to me, it reminds me of a big scone. I gave it 4 stars for the taste factor. It's good but not spectacular, and I love cranberries.

Here's another 5 star rating. Followed recipe exact with the exception of using 1 cup fresh cranberries and 1 cup craisins - end result was wonderful!  My oven must be a tad off as this was done in 38 minutes. This one will go in the front of my recipe box. Thanks for posting!

A 5 because it's so easy and so tasty with so few ingredients. I usually knock the sugar way down, but thought with the cranberries I should leave it. I'm glad I did. And the almond extract is just right! Godd by it self or with real vanilla ice cream:)

I made this because of the ease in prep and for the use of my frozen cranberries.  My family really enjoyed it, great with coffee and my husband loved it because it isn't too sweet and just a little bite of tartness. I stock up on cranberries when they go on sale after the holidays so I always have some in the freezer.

YUM!  I used 1/2c wheat flour and 1/2c white flour (I LOVE the texture of the wheat flour in baked goods) and baked for about 7 minutes longer than the recipe states.  This is totally a great breakfast cake!  (Better for breakfast than dessert I think)  Thanks for a great recipe!

OH My this was good.  Tangy yet sweet.  I made this exactly as stated and loved it.  Not too buttery, sweet, or sour.  Just right.  I used fresh berries.  I did barely sprinkle top with cinnamon sugar bix before baking (more for looks) I don't think it changed the taste.  After reading review I thought it would turn out more muffin like so I served for Thanksgiving day breakfast with a little whipped cream.  and coffee of cpourse.  YUM.  It would also be good for an after dinner dessert.

I made this exactly as written.  It is very much like a coffee cake or cranberry bread texture, but more moist.  The TARTness of the cranberries is what makes it.  Did have to bake it for 50 minutes, rather than 40.  It is very good!  Thank you for sharing your recipe, Jean!

I used about three-quarter amount of sugar suggested in the original recipe but came out very nice. I brought it to our Austrian friends and they loved it (probably they are fond of this kind of sour-sweet cakes). Definitely a keeper. My husband loved it and he didn't want me to take this cake to our friends' because he didn't want to share it with anybody!
DOn't skip the walnuts!

I really enjoyed this, and it was even better the second (and third) day. I disagree with other reviews saying that it's too sweet. I found it far from too sweet, and next time I make it I may decrease the fruit by a bit to cut down on the tartness.

It was different, tart and enjoyable but a one-time change but I wouldn't make it again which is sad as it was very easy, hopefully other people appreciate it more, it sure smelled wonderful!!: )

This is delicious and light.  I think it would also make a great muffin mix.

Wow, this was great.  I have a question for those of you that have made this.  I didn't know whether to use dried cranberries or whole, fresh cranberry in the packages that you find in the produce section.  Considering I used dried cranberry and it came out great, I guess maybe you cannot go wrong with either one.  In the image posted next to the recipe, it appears that whole cranberry were used.

I made this recipe as a little addition to the Thanksgiving pumpkin and apple pies and it was a big hit! Very easy and good. I made it in a tart pan with removable bottom and it popped out perfectly. A keeper.

Wonderful warm or cold.  I made it with a gluten free all-purpose flour mix for my mother who has celiac disease and it was delicious!  No one would have guessed that it was gluten-free.  Will try it with pecans next time.

This couldn't be easier. It is most delicious and the hint of almond is wonderful. Everyone loved it. I did however, cut back 2T on both the butter and sugar, and used pecans unstead of walnuts due to allergy factors. A definite keeper!

We have made it several times.  Its so easy, my wife definitely likes the almond flavor and up the amount to 3 tsp.  She has cut out the butter and it was fine.  I have cut the butter in half.  Either way it has been good.  I have also done 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.  Just so simple :)

I have a very similar recipe with the exception to the almond flavoring (mine has vanilla & pecans)  I love it with the almond!  The recipe title says pie, but it translates more like a coffee cake made in a pie pan. LOL.  It's moist, tart and not so sweet.  Delicious!

This is hands down the best baked cranberry recipe. Because of allergy issues, I substitute with gluten free baking flour and dairy free butter. It is delicious. I receive so many compliments and people have requested I make this during the holiday season. Makes great cupcakes too! I just add a little icing with the almond extract. The recipe, as is, worked out wonderful too.

This is perfectly delicious!   I only used vanilla, no almond extract and no nuts since there are nut allergies in our house.  I used a full bag of frozen cranberries and baked it in a cast iron pan. One of the simplest, tastiest things I've made in forever. Note that the dough really is almost the consistency of a cookie dough, I had to pat it into the pan.  Yummy!

I made it twice, the first time as written.  I loved it enough to share at our Holiday party.
The second time I made it with half the amount of almond extract and added a half of teaspoon vanilla extract.
Delicious both ways and it got good reviews.

I made it for Christmas 2019 dinner last night and there was a hush as we all started eating this pie; my sister started to spontaneously analyze it as we ate. We became so excited because it was so superb. Nothing else on the menu distracted us that way. We absolutely loved it!

I made the recipe with all ingredients as stated except I substituted 1 cup white sugar with honey.  If you like marzipan,  you'll love this dessert.  Delish, but not company worthy, which is why I gave it 4 out of 5 stars.

This was such a success that I made a second batch immediately so we could eat it right away.  I kept the other pie for an upcoming holiday party, but I know I need to run out for more cranberries, because one of these pies is not going to be enough. So tasty!  Light and tart with lovely color and just enough sweetness... and great texture, close to a brownie. 

I replaced the nuts with a half cup of Rice Krispies, which gave it a little crunch and lightness.  I also followed some reviewers suggestions to use 1/4 tsp almond extract and 3/4 tsp vanilla.  Great flavor and scent.  I don't do many reviews here, but I had to post about this one right away, to thank you for a great recipe.  New holiday staple in my house, for sure.  So easy to make!

Used pecans instead of walnuts because that's what I had on hand. I think the almond extract puts me off. Would have been much better with an orange glaze on top.

I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it! My mom requested that I make it again at Christmastime. The almond taste was a little strong, she thought I should do a little less almond extract next time, but although I agreed it was a little intense, I was happy with it as it was and likely won't change it next time.

Quick and easy! My whole family loves this cake-like 'pie'.  It only takes a few minutes to mix together and looks beautiful when its done! Yummy with or without nuts. If you are using frozen cranberries, just stir them in at the end otherwise they will freeze your butter and make the mix impossible to stir!

I made the first time with frozen cranberries, they thawed while I was preparing the "crust," and worked just fine. Everything else was as the recipe called for. It was delicious, a bit tart for my son, but not for me or my husband. If you're a rhubarb pie purist, like me,  the tart won't bother you. And, we noticed the 2nd day the tartness was toned down a bit. 

I'm making now with fresh cranberries and pecans (my dad's allergic to walnuts), and we won't be eating it for a day so we'll see if it really does cut the tartness. Next time, I'll play around with it.

Easy and yummy as is.

I made it exactly according to the recipe.  I thought it was a bit dry.  The next day, after one night in the fridge, it was a lot better.  I will definitely make it for my family as an additional treat for Thanksgiving.
By the Way " Allrecipes  - Folks",  Thanks for all your help.

This has quickly become a staple of Thanksgiving for my family and Favorite to make. I like to replace 1/4 cup of the flour with almond flour and 1/4 cup of the sugar for brown sugar. I also add some clove, nutmeg, and a little vanilla extract. People seem so surprised at the idea of a cranberry pie, but are always blown away by its taste. Thank you for the inspiration

I make this dessert regularly.   My dad is a diabetic. I use Splenda baking blend instead of sugar (0 sugar in the blend) and I use 1/2 the butter and add a little unsweetened apple sauce as a substitute.  I use Truvia brown sugar topping.  It comes out tasting like a warm scone.  Bake it less if you like it soft, more if you like it a hard scone texture.  You can make this for breakfast to go with a nice meal or a dessert.  Serve with ice cream as a dessert or add whipped cream.  So good.  I also looked up a strudel type topping once and it came out great too.  There are other things you can probably do with it.  It's easy to experiment.

This is a go-to dessert for me at the holidays. Not only is it delicious, it is easy to put together.  A winning combination during the crush of the holidays. 

The only modification I make, is to vary the size pan I bake it in - it does well in a 9" glass pie plate, an 8x8 baking dish, as well as a bread loaf. I have used both fresh and frozen cranberries with great success.

It is becoming a family favorite. I look forward to the time of year when the cranberries arrive in the stores, because I know I will be making this dessert very, very soon! 

Jean, thank you for a scrummy dessert.

Sooooo good. I put all of  the walnuts and cranberries on the bottom of the greased pie plate then covered with batter. It turned out just fine but I'd rather it be not mixed up. So I made it again. I doubled the recipe, put a handful of walnuts and cranberries on the bottom and folded the rest into the batter and baked in a metal 9x13. Turned out delicious. This is a recipe to keep!

This is one of my go to recipes though I use an 8x8 square pan and cut it into squares usuallyto bring to parties, etc. It’s a winner every time! I did make it once using vanilla extract rather than almond for my mother who doesn’t like that ‘marzipan’ flavor. It just wasn’t as good as using almond extract.  You really can’t go wrong with this recipe.

This is so simple to make and delicious every time. The center doesn't always cook through, and I've finally realized that bringing all the ingredients to room temperature before preparing the "pie" will help resolve that problem. The pie is very tart when first baked, and if there's any left over, will become mellow and sweet after a day or two. It's good both ways. I'll continue to make this over and over again.

Found this on allrecipes years ago and still make it often. Its so quick and easy, and you can substitute dried cherries or other fruit for fresh cranberries - and reduce sugar too. I usually use 1/3 c oil instead of butter - this and all variations I've tried work well. Fresh cranberries, very slight reduction in sugar, and about a third of the flour as whole wheat flour is our fave.

This recipe was so so so simple and the end result was delicious..  The only things I adjusted were using 1/2tsp almond, 1/2tsp vanilla.. and added a little cinnamon to the dry mixture... this will be written down in my go to recipe book for sure!

I have a houseful of non-cranberry loving boys. The entire pan was EMPTY in minutes. This was delicious! I followed one recipe suggestion and used half vanilla and half almond. Plenty of almond flavor there. I added a simple caster sugar glaze at the end once cooled. I will make this again for sure!

My husband loves cranberries so this Thanksgiving my recipes all had a cranberry theme! This pie was delicious, colorful and easy to prepare. I served mine warm with vanilla bean ice cream and it was a hit! Tastes good cold too as I had to try it the next day.

I decided last minute to make this for my Friendsgiving party because I had extra cranberries but didn't want to put in the effort of making a more complicated dish or pie. This was a hit! Not too sweet and SO easy to make! Everyone loved it.

My mom loved this,  I liked it - my teenage daughter didn't. It was too bland for her - and I could also do with additional sweetness. I did add a few additional crushed walnuts on top, but otherwise made this exactly as written. I did like how easy it was. Next time, I would add the brown sugar topping one reviewer suggested as well as additional cranberries.

Oh my goodness, these were a hit! Cocktail party people couldn't stop eating them. They are sweetish (but not too sweet) and savory and those who love shortbread will love the almond flavor.  See below for recipe info, gluten free mod option and Add ons.

RECIPE: Followed it. Used frozen cranberries. They rock. Also used almond extract.

ADD ONS:
(1)White Choc Chips (1/3 cup of white chocolate chips (365 Brand, Whole Foods). 
(2)Topping: Blended 1/4 cup almonds, 1/3c brown sugar, 2T melted butter and sprinkled on. Also sprinkled on some demerara sugar for crunch. 

DIETARY RESTRICTIONS? If you are gluten free, they come out equally fabulously with King Arthur Cup for Cup GF flour.

As suggested by others, I used sliced almonds instead of walnuts but otherwise stayed with the recipe.  It was delicious!  A chewy texture, slightly crunchy outside and tart (from cranberries) and sweet at same time.  Best of all, super easy to make.  Thank you for sharing!

I made a double batch cuz I had the fresh cranberries. I did use 1/2 sugar and 1/2 stevia. I added cinnamon to the batter. I also added the topping like the other reviewer following her proportions only I used organic coconut sugar instead of brown and used pecans instead of walnuts. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed it with French vanilla ice cream.

Followed original recipe but with a little vanilla added. It was good but it needed the crumble topping, which others mentioned and I did not do.  Do the topping!

My first review on this site.  This pie is AMAZING!  So simple, quick and easy.  I too used 1/4 tsp almond extract and 3/4 tsp vanilla - just prefer vanilla over almond.  NOTE:  I used my hands to mix it and smooth it into the pie plate.  It is super thick batter. My husband requested a second slice even though he's trying to get rid of his "cruise body" - ha, ha!  Thanks, Jean for a wonderful recipe to add to my favorites file.

Loved this when my mom made it. Unfortunately the “whole cranberry sauce” I got wasn’t what I was expecting, so I used strawberries. Doubled the recipie and threw it in a 13x9. Fabulous with whipped cream.

I have made it a few times as is and with raspberries, I have made it with frozen and thawed fruit.  I made it with gluten free bisquick and used 3/4 cup of sugar.  Great for celiacs.  I wish I could give it more than 5 stars.  Thank you for posting Jean.

This is very good as is. I used an 8x8 pan.
I have made it without any walnuts,
used 1/2 t almond extract, 1/2t vanilla, 2t orange juice,
sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top before baking,
all good. I will try using blueberries or strawberries and rhubarb, should be equally good!

Made it according to the recipe.  Will definitely make it again, probably with more nuts.

I really enjoyed this.  The only change I made was to substitute light olive oil for half the melted butter as I do in most of my baking.  You still get the good taste of butter and lower the saturated fat.  It turned out perfect.

This was surprisingly wonderful! I did not increase the sugar, but I only used 1/2 tsp almond extract and I changed half the butter for unsweetened applesauce. I also left out the nuts. We thought it was wonderful, and the only thing I would change next time (besides my above changes) would be to sprinkle some coarse grain sugar on top to give it a crunch. This is an any season treat! I baked it in my cast iron skillet (as suggested by another reviewer) and it did need longer to bake but no biggie.

I've made one with and without walnuts every thanksgiving for the last 2 years. Always a hit. Perfect the next day with a cup of coffee. You can play around with the sweet and tart ratio, personally I use a little less sugar to bring out the sugar in the fruit.

I always  add more cranberries - generally the most of a 12oz bag after I’ve rinsed and picked through, removing undesirable berries. Turns out great and packed full of tart cranberries!

This was fantastic and I will make it again and again.  The only changes I made was to use gluten-free flour for all purpose flour and ground pecans instead of walnuts.  My daughter suggested adding coconut to the batter next time.  This recipe is definitely a keeper

This is GREAT. I disagree with the criticism that it’s too much almond extract, I thought it was perfect. Especially the next day the flavor had mellowed and it was delicious. I use unsalted butter so I increased the salt to 1/2 tsp and added a couple dashes of cinnamon. Wonderful, will make again!

My husband really liked it.  I had everything needed on hand and it was very simple to make.  I might try again with some of the suggestions listed, but even without them, it was a hit.  I will make this again, might need to stock up on cranberries.

Beware of one reviewers advice to cook on convection for 30mns at 350 degrees - so NOT done! I've made this a couple of times and the pan you use makes a big difference in getting the timing right. Even tho' my toothpick came out clean, it wasn't  done. If you get it right, it's a good dessert.

followed the recipe used vanilla extract instead of almond (didn't have that) and used black walnuts, which a lot of people don't like, but we do.  It was delicious!  Will make often.  Husband flipped over it.

Although I would not call this a pie, it was wonderful. I have made this twice now, the first time following the directions faithfully. The second time, I doubled the recipe, omitting the nuts, and baked it in a 9" x 13" rectangular cake pan. I iced it with glaze made from lemon juice and icing sugar and took it for a work pot luck where it was well received.

We enjoyed this "pie" which I would describe as a blonde brownie. However, it was rather tart,so definitely needed to be served with ice cream. Next time I think I would try sprinkling coarse sparkling sugar on top for some added sweetness and crunch. Also would double the amount of walnuts. I didn't have almond extract so I used vanilla extract, and that was fine. Quick easy recipe (doesn't even need a mixer).  I might try a blueberry/ pecan version too.

The first time I made this, I mixed the butter, extract and eggs together - big mistake, as the eggs cooled down the butter.  The second time, I poured the butter over the flour mixture and then added the eggs and extract.  The batter was perfect!  What a gorgeous dessert for the holiday season!  Like others, I preferred the almond over vanilla.  Thanks for a great recipe!

the mix did not look anything like it looked in the video.  It was very dry and floury, so I added another egg to give it more moisture.  I baked it in a  glass cake pan. Just had a nibble and it seems a little dry but it still tasted ok.

It turned out great. I followed everything exactly instead of  almond extract I used 1 tsp of lemon extract. Also no  topping. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream.

So easy, and delicious!  The tartness is a nice change from overly sweet desserts.  I used vanilla extract instead of almond.

This is so good! Really amazing flavor blend-it’s hard to stop eating! I made 2- one for us and one for the family Christmas Party. It’s great with or without whipped cream and for myself- I prefer it cold. Thanks for a wonderful and very easy recipe!

A bit tarter than I expected.  But I did use half the sugar and half stevia extract.  And it wasn't as light as I thought it should be.  Overall, tasted alright and will be making it again!

Will make this again. Pretty festive for the holidays & has a slight tartness (fresh cranberries) to taste which I love as compared to super sweet deserts! Not a fan of crust so this was fantastic!!!oh, and I substituted Spenda for sugar!

I made this exactly as the recipe  was written and it was a huge success.  Baked in a red ceramic pie plate it was a perfect holiday desert ; warm, festive and sweet but not too sweet  I will definitely make it again.

Made a slight change, half the amount of cranberry and added 1 cup of finely diced apple. Used brown sugar only because I have lots in the cupboard. Really happy with my first attempt !

I got this recipe years ago from a friend in CO. We wait each year for the cranberries to come onto the island and then make the "pie " at least twice a month until the end of the season. I have made changes out of laziness. I use the whole bag of cranberries and pecan halves instead of walnuts. We prefer pecans and I usually have them laying around to make the candied pecans recipe found on this site. I may or may not snap the halves in half. Again, lazy. I also use a tablespoon of almond extract. We like cranberries and really enjoy the tartness of them. Because I use more cranberries than the recipe calls for, I have to cook it a bit longer. top it with custard and eat'em up!

The only thing I had to substitute was the extract. We really liked the pie and have made this more than a couple of times. I don't think it stands up as well as some of the other kinds but it didn't last long in our house anyway!

I have made this at least a dozen times. Every time I serve it, the people want the recipe. The only thing I changed is that I use 1 cup of finely chopped nuts vs. 1/2 cup. It's so easy! And tastes so good for dessert or for breakfast with your coffee!

This was very good but very tart.  Next time I might cut cranberries to 1 1/2 cups.  I did make the steusel topping others suggested.

Used pecans and took advise to use vanilla and almond extract. Easy to assemble. Saved pecans and cranberries for top garnish. Very pretty.

I made this as written, and while the flavor is excellent, I struggle with why this is called a “pie”. It seems that you could bake this in a loaf pan, where it would more aptly be called quick bread. I’ll try it again in some other form.

I have been making this recipe for years. My only change is using less almond flavoring, substituting partially with vanilla.    I bake these in loaf pans, often with a struesel topping or finish with a little glaze when cool.  Everyone loves it.

It was just OK. For us, there was way too much almond flavor. The cranberry flavor was lost. I will try it again, either omitting the almond altogether or cutting way back on the amount added.

I think next time I will use vanilla instead of almond extract because I felt that it overpowered most of the other flavors.

I cut back on the sugar a bit as two guests are diabetic.  It's delicious as a dessert and would be a nice companion to a coffee or tea.  I have a feeling it would freeze well so you could keep it on hand.  The fresh cranberries were just the right amount of tartness.

I used white chocolate chips in place of nuts because I didn't have any nuts.  It was delicious.  Friend made it the next day because it was so good and said it was even better with the nuts.

Easy and similar to another "cobbler style" recipe I use.  Made as directed and too sweet for my group.  Made a second time with half the sugar and swapped out the almond extract with a shot of bourbon.  Used fresh cranberries.  Second version was a winner according to my friends.

I doubled the recipe and cooked in a 9 x 13. I could have used an even larger pan. Very moist and my tasters liked it.  Used some fresh, some frozen cranberries, and they turned out fine. A nice blend of sweet and tart. 
Need to find a way to make it gluten free as many looks for food like that. Don't consider it a pie, but rather a cake...

I sprinkled a 1/2 c of brown sugar over the cranberries before adding the batter. I needed to bake an additional 10 minutes.

Super easy!  I loved that I didn't even have to use an electric mixer - just mix with a wooden spoon.  To me, this is the perfect "coffee cake" to go with afternoon tea, morning coffee.   I love cranberries and was looking for something different to make with them. This filled the bill and I think it's a keeper!   I baked it in an 8x8 glass dish.  I love the look of the pie but I thought the square would be more practical for cutting small bites.   I used another poster's suggestion and used 1/2 tsp. almond extract, 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract, 1 tsp. orange juice and orange zest.  I loved the tart taste to this and it's a very pretty dish.  It was supposed to go to Thanksgiving tomorrow as an extra desert with my pumpkin cheesecake but I can tell it won't make it there.   DH and DS love it.   Already 1/3 gone!

Surprisingly amazing. Very easy to make. Even those who "claimed" to dislike cranberries gobbled this up! Thanks for a wonderful recipe. I've already made this a handful of times. It has become a holiday staple.

I made it with fresh cranberries in muffin tray and tart pan and came out great. Using whole cranberries gives the very aggressive berry profile, and it looks like it won't hold up, but it does. For less aggressive look I'd recommend halving/chopping the berries. The walnuts really add great texture. I made some whipped cream topping with orange essence to top this!

It's really not a pie; it's cake/bread. Or coffee cake. It took 8 minutes longer to cook than directed. Cranberries are very tart and delicious but many kids will find that off-putting if you're cooking for a family gathering with kids. I added some extra cranberries on top for esthetics and sprinkled white sugar on top. It's really very good, but not WOW good.

I make this every fall/winter, a 100% winner!
BUT this summer I tried something new. I swapped the cranberry for chopped strawberries and rhubarb and the almond extract for vanilla. Another instant hit!
I look forward to making this again soon and seeing what other fruit I can swap!

This pie is wonderful!  Was a hit with our guests with whip cream!  More like a coffee cake (we had it for breakfast with coffee!). I used slivered almonds rather than walnuts but otherwise wouldn’t change a thing.  Will be making this again soon!

I love fresh cranberries and this is spectacular. The only change I made was half almond and half vanilla (I didn't have enough almond) extract and it was more than enough almond flavor. Definitely will make this again. Since I can't seem to leave a recipe "as is", I may add some orange  peel next time and will try it with almonds instead of walnuts.  Thank you for a terrific recipe.

Loved this dessert. I did as another reviewer suggested and put the berries and nuts in the pie plate, then spread the  batter over. I also used maple flavouring since I was out of almond. Tart and delicious. I will make again with other fruits too. A definite keeper.

I've made this several times. I love fresh cranberries. I use the whole bag! The almond extract makes this recipe. I add cinnamon just because I love cinnamon. It is a very pretty presentation. Definitely not a traditional pie. Easy, quick recipe.

I am disappointed, since the reviews for so spectacular; I did not read the negative reviews beforehand. I guess I was hoping it might be a cross between cake and crumble. I am not a fan of moist cake (and of course dump cakes is the extreme in this spectrum). 

I used whole wheat flour and my hand-picked currants, plus chia seeds for the walnut. It's rather good when it's hot, and probably heated up and a scoop of ice cream. But it is still a dump cake, due to the lack of leavening agent - so it  is a moist cakey dish. The chia surprisingly worked great.

Absolutely loved it.  I used defrosted cranberries, and cooked it in muffin tins.  Everyone raved about them.   The walnuts, cranberries, and almond extract were spot on.

This is delicious and so easy! The tartness of the Cranberries and the not overly sweetness are perfect. This will be one of my top goto recipes!

It tasted okay but not great. Took 60 min (using frozen berries maybe why? I added vanilla like another user suggested. Easy but not worth making again

I made this for Thanksgiving. I made it exactly per the recipe, except that I added a bit more almond extract. It was an awesome scone-like dessert served with fresh whipped cream, whipped with powdered sugar. Yes, I will make this again!

So simple and so delicious.   Like a giant cranberry cookie or brownie.  I made it at first to use up leftover cranberries, but it's so easy we now make it all the time.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is so simple and easy but so good! It looks pretty and is very tasty. The batter is reminiscent of a sugar cookie. It's great for the holidays, or anytime of year.

Wonderful, unique, refreshing dessert!  Used the following:  12-oz fresh cranberries, divided (2 cups in the dough, remainder gently pressed into the top for a nice presentation); 1/2 cup sliced almonds for subtle taste and nice texture--have additional to press into the top; 1/4 tsp almond extract and 3/4 tsp Fiori di Sicilia extract  to enhance the citrus flavor of the pie; added zest of 1 orange (a must!); put all in a pie plate and topped with King Arthur Flour "Sparkling Sugar" for pretty presentation and additional texture.  Baked 60-90 minutes.  Good while warm, but fantastic the next day or day after!  This dessert will become a permanent part of my Fall rotation.

I did reduce the almond extract - 1/4 tsp and increased the vanilla to 3/4 tsp.  Great in the morning with coffee or tea- wonderful tart taste.  Could get really creative and mix cranberries with any kind of fruit.  I saved this receipe as my husband loved it too and will make it again and again

I loved this cake before it was even born! I was totally won over by the almond aroma! I tweaked the recipe just adding some special touches with pistachio nuts, white chocolate chips & sweetened shaved coconut. Thank you for the inspiration! I can see making this & slightly different versions for many years!

I cut the servings to four and used ramekins instead of a pie tin, but otherwise followed the instructions.  I would certainly not call this "pie", but it is very good and not a whole lot of trouble.

I've made this twice now, adding the streusel topping suggested by others.  I also added a bit of orange peel and oil which took this to another level.  This is now a family favorite.

Very good! I made this following the recipe (except for the nuts-I was out) and it turned out great. I  also made it a second time and reduced the butter by 1-2tb and it was still good. Very simple easy recipe also and it doesn't take forever which I find very important.

I found I had to cook it 5 minutes longer than the posted time.  I used fresh cranberries which I had frozen and then thawed completely.  It was no problem.  It was nice having the sweet and then tart taste.  Not a fancy dessert for a special occasion but our friends loved it and requested the recipe.  I left out the walnuts as I just don't like them.

I made no changes. In my oven it took an additional fifteen minutes to cook through and develop a brown crunchy top.
My concern: As an experienced baker, I adore using all the ingredients. Some of them are not exactly cheap. And fresh cranberries are seasonal.
So whereas I certainly recognize that an inexperienced baker could easily make this recipe... a good thing.....I would also observe that the end product is not remarkable in  any way and constitutes a terrible waste of gorgeous ingredients that might be more successfully utilized elsewhere.
Obviously a child, for example, might enjoy the effort. And God knows it's certainly edible, if forgettable....

So moist and yummy!  I used 1/2 c. of sugar and 1/2 c. of Splenda.  Good flavor and great texture .  I am making this for our Christmas rally.  It doesn't need anything else, but will probably drizzle a powdered glaze on it just for show.  This was easy to make and delicious!

I made it for a Thanksgiving dessert and it was very well received.  I assume almond essence must come  in different strengths because I used the amount stated  in the recipe and it was just right but subtle.   Also put the streusel on top as suggested.   Loved the slight tartness of the cranberries with the sweetness of the cake.  It will  definitely become a staple of our Thanksgiving celebration.

We really liked this crust less cranberry pie!
I did change the recipe to 1/4 teaspoon almond extract and 3/4 teaspoon vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon Cinnamon. 
I also used sliced almonds.
I will be making this again soon.

I've made this recipe twice in the last week, since my husband and I can't stop eating it! This recipe is super easy to make and takes all of 10min. to put together. I tend to have to cook it slightly longer than the 40min. that is recommended, but other than that I wouldn't change a thing. Great recipe!

Very good & very uncomplicated. I did use a tad less sugar (~ 7/8 c.) and less almond extract ,but some vanilla as suggested by others. I made 2: one with walnuts & one with almond slices; we all preferred the salmon version.

In a glass pie dish cook for 55-60 min.  I took to work, everyone LOVED it.  They were willing to pay for more.

I love this recipe!  I made it with white whole wheat flour, turbinado sugar and changed the almond extract from 1 tsp. to 0.25 tsp with 0.74 tsp. Madagascar vanilla. I also added in about 1 tbsp. almonds to the walnuts and sprinkled some on the top along with a few extra cranberries to provide color and texture. It's a very delicious dessert, and I highly recommend it!

Wow this was such a simple receipe with complex flavors. The first time I followed the receipe.  The second time I added orange zest and allspice. Like it much better with zest and spice. Sent to work with my husband. Coworkers loved it.

This is my "go-to" quick and easy pie/cake.  A little lemon zest in the batter makes an excellent summer dessert while some raspberry syrup adds enough weight for winter time.

My kids like my version with half cranberry/half fresh raspberry.  They call it the "magenta placenta cake".  Don't ask.

Made this tonight and was so glad I found this recipe. Used Splenda due to hubs dietary restrictions but it came out great. Also used sliced almonds instead of walnuts. Seemed to make sense as using almond extract...Wanted to try putting some Sugar in the Raw on top, but could only use about a tsp. and you couldn't even tell it was there. Would need at least a Tbsp. or two. Next time I will put it on half! Had it about 30 min. after it came out of the oven with vanilla ice cream. Yum!

I made this wonderful cake last year for Thanksgiving. Everyone enjoyed it, but it did not rise like the one in the photo. Id like to make it again for Thanksgiving, how can I proceed so that it will rise more without using  any leaveners?

Delicious! I used whole wheat flour and cane sugar and it turned out beautifully. I want to eat it all myself! This is definitely being added to the holiday meals and a few in between just because it is that yummy!

This is one of the favorite desserts when the family is here for the holidays.  Even the young great grandchildren love it.  

I love it as it's easy to make and contains less calories than many holiday desserts.

I made it exactly as written and with frozen cranberries. It was  extremely easy and tasted wonderful. Will definitely make this many times. And, because it has no leaven, it'll be good for Passover!

My sister made this for me last year and I loved it.  As soon as cranberries were in store I bought them.  I made one for a party on Saturday and another 2 to take to work.  I substituted the Almond Extract with Lemon Extract and it was delicious.  Everyone who tried it loved it and several requested the recipe.

This was such a yummy desert! A very nice balance of sweet and tart and extremely moist. Had to leave the nuts out due to an allergy but that didn't take away from the flavor of the cake. I can't use almond extract so I used vanilla and added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. Will defintely be making this again!

Will make it again. It's addictive. I used sliced almonds instead of the walnuts. Instead of 1 tsp almond extract, I used 1/2 tsp almond extract and 1/2 tsp vanilla. To the dry ingredients I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp cloves.

Great!  My husband just went on a low carb diet but the Doc says he can have whole wheat flour.  I found this recipe and changed the 1 cup of sugar to 1 cup of stevia, The flour to whole wheat, added a few more  cranberries and walnuts.  It came out SO GOOD I could not believe it.  So easy and so good. It is a regular when ever we need to fool ourselves that we are eating something sweet.

This was delishious. It pairs well with Chardonnay. It's kind of like a cranberry cobbler. I cooked it exactly as written. I had to extend my cooking time for whatever reason, but it was excellent! I will make this again next time cranberries come back into season.

WOW and Lord Have Mercy this is Simple and Very Very good.
I made minimal changes and they are: 
1/2 tsp Almond Extract
1/2 tsp Vanilla Extract
1 3/4 Cup of Frozen Cranberries

Brought this to the office for Pi Day and it was like watching locusts devour it. Making in the near future and it's not rotation for my holiday pies.

Every time I  make this, it's amazing.  Everyone loves it, especially about an hour after it comes out of the oven.  When you bake it, make sure to let it cool UNCOVERED, as this will allow a delicious crust-like texture to form on the top. Just amazing.  Using walnuts is good, but using PECANS makes it to die for!

I made this as written, it was very simple. It was good and I really liked the texture however it was not sweet enough for me. I doubt I will make this again but if I do I will add a crumb topping to sweeten it up a bit.

This cranberry cake is really good.  I followed the recipe , but added more vanilla almond flavoring and walnuts than called for.  Easy and good.  Took longer to cook than 40 minutes, more like 55.

This is so yummy for breakfast! I am gluten free/dairy free and this recipe works perfectly with Bob's Red Mill GF flour and Spectrum butter flavor shortening. I also cut back on the sugar and use only 2/3 cup and it's  perfect.

I tried it in a 9x9 pan but didn't like the way it turned out. Best made in the pie plate. Many people asked for the recipe.

Update:  I substituted light brown sugar in place of the white.  Bad idea.  It stayed gooey ish, despite baking it longer.
Also, i love the tartness but if making for others, it would be good to reduce the cranberries 

So delicious!!! Super easy!!  I used full amount of almond extract, and it was perfect.  Added only 1/4 tsp vanilla extract.  Used  whole wheat pastry flour like I always do.  It was like a cookie cake, even my husband loved it.

This is one of my favorite desserts.   The only thing I added was a glaze drizzle  of powdered sugar, almond extract and a little water.  I can't tell you how many people have asked for the recipe.  Sometimes I use a mini-muffin pan to make tiny cakes....when you just want a sweet bite.

To easy for 5 stars. Ready good and can add to. Made exactly and really liked it. Age with person about not doing streusel. The almond is important. Helps with dryness of walnuts ands tasty of cranberries. Add to it make it your yours. Good recipe.

Really yummy desert! I had to use pecans instead of walnuts and vanilla extract instead of almond because that's what I had on hand. But everyone that tried it liked it today! This recipe is a keeper in my opinion.

My German mother-in-law loves this recipe, and its SO easy to make, so I typically make it about 4-5 times per year for family holiday parties.   I always add a generous amount of turbinado sugar to the top before baking... it adds an extra crunch and sweetness that completes the dish.

Great recipe and really easy to make. Only substitution, I used orange extract instead of almond because I don't like almond flavor.  Cranberry orange - great flavors. Everyone loves this crustless pie!

My absolute favorite holiday dessert! It could not be easier and taste any better! I love the combination of sour cranberry and sweetness from the sugar. The almond extract takes it over the top. Follow recipe as directed.

This is a family favorite.  I bake in a loaf pan or in large muffin pan for holiday gifts to family and friends.  We consider it more of a bread then a pie.  Hubby loves it so much he had me try it with canned cranberries when fresh cranberries were not available (it was a disaster).  So we now freeze cranberries when they come in season so he can enjoy year round.
Unique flavor.

I've made this pie several times.  I use addition 1/4 cup sugar and almond extract too.  It's a hit.  I didn't have any problems using frozen cranberris but I have a kitchenaid mixer so maybe that made a difference.

I made this exactly as the recipe states and it was absolutely fantastic! Took it to a party and everyone loved it.  I considered doing the crumble topping but ran out of nuts.  For my tastes, I am glad I left it off because it would have made it too sweet--but if you like your desserts  on the sweeter side, add it.  Without, it was a light and refreshing blend of sweet and tart. It is more like a cake than a pie--I didn't have a pie tin, so made it in a 9" round cake tin.  Fantastic.

Wowzers!!!!!
My 3 young sons devoured three pieces each!!!  Even without any vanilla ice cream!!!!
Maybe reduce the cranberry a bit next time as some palates thought it a bit tart. I made it for Thanksgiving but would be wonderful at Christmas too.
I made it four days later with half frozen cherry and half cranberry and the color changed to red so won't do that again.  I also used the Stevia/sugar combo to reduce the sugar which seemed to go down well.
Highly recommend this recipe!!!!!

Excellent! First I made as is, but later lightened it up by using eggbeaters, and subbed half the butter with applesauce, topped with gourmet sugar crystals and just as delicious. I want to try with apples next and cut the sugar a bit.

This was delicious! Tasted much like a 'big cookie' sans chocolate chips. I made it gluten free subbing 1 cup Better Batter and a tiny pinch of baking soda for the all purpose flour. I also used 1 tablespoon less sugar than the recipe called for.

So easy!  I used vanilla in place of almond because I don't like the taste of almond.  Thank you for the note that using frozen cranberries will result in a very thick batter.  This couldn't be easier to make, and it turned out great!

Very tasty.  We liked the tart cranberries and the sweet cake.  It may have been better named as a cranberry cobbler.  When I don't have almond extract, I have  used vanilla extract and added a little ground clove, still very good.

I made this pie this past thanksgiving, husband liked it but I loved eating it a day after baking. It is sweet but not very and the bitterness of cranberry makes for a great convo.

these ingredients are usually on hand so don't waste time driving to the store.  You can throw in extra frozen berries if you want.  It's great for a picnic or potluck. Super easy.

my husbands favorite. i use vanilla extract instead of almond and have used almonds or walnuts and both work well. i have also given it to others and they like it too. i personally am not a fan of the tartness but everyone else loves it so... when cranberries are in season, it will be made :)

This is a great recipe, so easy to make and so delicious.  As a cranberry lover, I use 3 cups of them and eat the entire thing within a day and a half.

This seemed more like a cake in pie shape-still delicious though.  My cranberries all rose to the top so the bottom 2/3 was mostly plain cake. I will def. make this again though.

Made this for a Christmas dinner I attended.  I substituted almonds for the walnuts and used vanilla extract instead of the almond extract (had to use what I had on hand).  Highly recommend this pie for those who do not pie crust.

I followed this recipe exactly as above, and I loved it. Myself, I wouldn't call it a pie, but whatever it is, it's delicious! This recipe is great as it is, but I can also imagine many delicious variations. I would like to try the same recipe, but with different fruits and nuts, sometime. Many users also recommended a strussel tipping, which has piqued my interest--I think I may make a topping next time. Awesome!

So simple, and yet so yummy!  Heated with some vanilla ice cream, and it's heavenly. I had frozen cranberries, but I did let them thaw first before added them to the batter. It was perfecto!! I also cut back on the almond extract as advised by others.

Made it as directed in the recipe. It was simple yet perfect. I added 1 tbs wheat germ. Gave it a different texture but overall very nice. I will make this again to use up my stock of cranberries from thanksgiving!!!

Mega delicious!! I used coconut oil instead of butter as I can't have dairy, a scant half tsp of almond extract and pecans instead of walnuts (as I have a Costco size bag of them to use up) plus my cranberries were frozen and the mixture resembled a crumble topping, not batter. I baked it in my 9" cast iron pan for 40 minutes.  I was pretty nervous as I put it in the oven that I'd wasted my ingredients, but a marvellous surprise came out of the oven when the time went! Super delicious, I'll most definitely make this again.

Just made this for the 2nd time!  It has received rave reviews in my house and was requested again- now just waiting for it to come out of the oven!  Very quick and easy to put together, great for when you don't feel like putting in a ton of effort.  After reading other reviews, I did substitute 1/2 tsp of Vanilla extract & 1/2 tsp of Almond extract.  But I will try it as written next time.

I'm not a cranberry fan but had 2 bags from the co-op I needed to use and came across this recipe. I decided to make it for our Thanksgiving get together. Everyone who tried it absolutely LOVED it including me. I did use some of the suggestions like decreasing amount of cranberries and the streusel topping. I didn't have almond extract so I used 1 t or vanilla and left the cinnamon out of the streusel. I also pulled it out of the oven when the toothpick still had some pie stuck to it to help keep it moist. This is definitely a do over and have been asked for the recipe. Thank you for sharing!!!

I liked the cranberries, but my family found them to be too tart. Next time I'll try blueberries, or perhaps chopped/mashed sweetened cranberries. Instead of walnuts, I used chopped pecans, which were very good. I followed a previous reviewer's advice and used only 1/4 tsp of almond extract, and added 3/4 tsp vanilla, plus 1/2 tsp cinnnamon and 1/8 tsp cloves. I also mixed in about 1/2 tsp baking powder into the flour/sugar mixture. So the cakey part turned out very well.

This pie is fantastic!! I didn't change anything about the recipe and it came out delicious. I used frozen cranberries just FYI. I made the mistake of making this when I was the only one home and I had to force myself to stop eating it before I made myself sick.

I added a dash of nutmeg, cloves and cinnamon, and made the streusel topping, and still thought it was bland. I think it needed a lot more sugar. It also came out with the texture of a scone. I was hoping for something much more juicy and dessert like.

This was wonderful!  I didn't have any almond extract, so just used vanilla.  We had some friends over and everyone enjoyed it.  The next day my mother asked if we had any leftovers as she wanted another piece.  Definitely a desert I will make again and again!  And it looked so delicious, too!  Perfect!  Thank you for sharing this recipe, Jean!

OMG!  Everyone I have made it for loves it.  Just made it again on this snowy morning.  Did as others suggested and cut the almond extract down to 1/4 tsp and made up the rest with 3/4 tsp vanilla.  I can't count how many times I have given out the recipe!

Love it. Used pecans instead of walnuts and vanilla in place of almond extract. Turned out great. Love the way the edges bake into a crust. good warm or cool.

I've made this recipe twice in three weeks and its great.  The second time I didn't have enough cranberries so I added blueberries to bring it to two cups and it was even better! Served it to guests and they wanted the recipe.

Excellent recipe, I made it as written but left out the nuts. I highly recommend keeping the almond extract as written, it was delicious. I used frozen cranberries without defrosting them. Perfect, thank you!

Like the recipe, but altered it to go low-carb. Half cup of almond flour and half cup of flax meal. Sweetner was erythritol brown (like brown sugar). I added an egg to help with the heaviness of the flour substitutes. I didn't have almond extract so I used tangerine (how's that for a substitution!). Turned out great.

I made it exactly as written and it was WONDERFUL.  I love pies that make their own crusts.  I bought several bags of cranberries over the Christmas holidays and just threw them in the freezer.  I wanted to be able to make this pie again in the heat of the Summer.  I love making things that are totally unexpected for the season...like homemade ice cream in January and Rosettes for the 4th of July.

Made this with blueberries and no walnuts and it was so good.  The original recipe is awesome too but the blueberry version is sweeter.

Great dessert. My husband loved it.  I added an apple to increase moisture.  I would actually call this a torte not a pie.

This was really good! As per some of the other reviews, made a few adjustments, but I think the spirit of the cake was pretty much the same - and yes, this is more of a cake than a pie. I used almonds instead of walnuts in the batter, and didn't have almond extract so I used only vanilla. I also mad the topping with walnuts, brown sugar, butter, and flour, and put a few cranberries half in the top for color and presentation. My husband ate two pieces as soon as it came out of the oven and I'll be surprised if we have a whole lot more by the end of the day. Very unique - great to bring to a brunch!

Love this recipe ... quick, easy, and delicious.  For my taste, I prefer using 1.5 cups of fresh cranberries (less tart than using the full 2 cups), 1/2 tsp almond extract, 1/2 tsp vanilla extract, and no nuts.  The batter is the consistency of soft cookie dough.  After baking for 40 minutes, the finished pie looks beautiful, and it tastes just as good as it looks.  I will be making this again next Fall when I can get fresh cranberries.

Made as written.  Twice. Want to try as mini muffins.
Want to try with other berries.  Great as a dessert with
vanilla ice cream or whipped cream.  Great as coffee
cake in the morning.  My new favorite recipe!

This is a crowd pleaser - I have a couple of variations.  It's good as printed or with gluten free flour.  I also make it with crushed pineapple/macadamia nuts/vanilla in place of the cranberries/almonds/almond extract.  My family likes that even better.  Reduce sugar to 1/2 c for the pineapple version.  I tried to make this as cupcakes and they turned out very tough, but I probably mixed it too long.  This is a great recipe for my gluten sensitive friends! Only thing to watch for is that it does not brown like you'd expect.

Made this for Christmas and loved it!  I loved the almond flavor and the tartness of the cranberries. The only thing I added was some coarse sugar on top before baking. Was fantastic.

Having about five extra pounds of cranberries, I was looking for something to use them up. I made one batch, then another, and then another (I am making gift goodie baskets for Christmas gifts). I used a mini pie tin that makes six pies at a time and the recipe, as is, makes a perfect amount of batter for the six pies. I plan on making two full sized pies in the morning to take to Christmas Eve dinner with the family. I think I might add a bit of lemon juice just to add a little bit more tartness, but even without that, this recipe is amazing!!!

I have loved this recipe for some time now.  I love it perfectly in it's original form.  I do however bake it in an 8" round cake pan and love it.    last night I substituted blueberries for the cranberries....totally different taste.....but we loved it as well!  And excellent recipe all around!

Made this to use up some leftover cranberries, and it looked easier than my usual go-to recipe (cranberry pecan upside down cake from this site) I did make a few modifications--used pecans instead of walnuts, and half whole wheat flour, and 1/2 tsp each of almond and vanilla extract after reading some other reviews. The result is delicious and was super easy to make, and not too many dishes dirtied either! I think I may bring this to Christmas dinner!

This was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, except for adding 1/2 tsp vanilla and only 1/4 tsp almond extract. Next time I'll try it as written. I also reserved a handful of cranberries to press into the top of the batter as suggested by another reviewer. It was beautiful. I'll be making this for Christmas dessert. Thank you!

I had some fresh cranberries given to me and wasn't sure what I was going to do with them. I wanted to make muffins, but most recipes called for orange juice/zest and I didn't feel like running to the store. I happened upon this recipe and am VERY glad that I did! WONDERFUL! I followed as directed, except that I used coconut sugar instead of white sugar and almonds instead of walnuts. I chopped the almonds - when I make again, and I will, i will try roasting and chopping the almonds. Simply FABULOUS - thank you for sharing!!

Very easy and very tasty. I made this for Thanksgiving and prepped it in the morning after starting the turkey. It went in the oven just before lunch was served and ready to roll with ice cream or whipped cream by dessert time.

i made this following the recipe as written the first time and thought it was OK, but needed some changes.  Second time I doubled the batter and kept the cranberries to one bag; I used 1/2 cup almond flour (ground almond) plus 1 1/2 cups whole wheat pastry flour to give me 2 cups of flour and like I said I doubled the other ingredients except for cranberries.  I also used 1/2 tsp almond extract plus 1 1/2 vanilla because I knew the almond flour would give plenty of almond flavor (which I adore).  I added toasted slivered almonds instead of walnuts.  I used a ceramic deep dish pie plate and it was perfect for the amount of batter.  I topped the batter with washed raw sugar to give it a little bit of crunch.  I baked for about an hour but it could have used a bit more time; I think baking time is one of the hardest things to pin down, especially when I modify a recipe.  At the end of this process I had a beautiful cake/pastry that reminded me of the Danish holiday pastries a loved and devoured when I lived in Seattle.  The use of almond flour gives this cake a texture and flavor similar to marzipan.  The cranberries give it a bright burst of freshness that balances the sweetness.  It might not be everyone's idea of a success, but my family really loved it. o

Delicious!!! I made it for thanksgiving and everyone loved it!!! 
The only alteration that I made to this recipe is that I used 100% whole wheat flour instead of regular flour and added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon to the mix, and it came out to be very good :)

I made this for Thanksgiving this year. I didn't have a pie pan so I used a cake pan which worked just fine. Because I wanted a local dish, I swapped the cranberries and walnuts for satsumas and pecans. The cake came out great, done after 40 minutes in the oven and still yummy after sitting out for a few hours.

Made this for the first time! Don't think it was all that great?  Read other comments and made it with almond and vanilla. It still had a nice almond flavor, glad I did use half and half.  Didn't add extra sugar to the top, sweet enough.

See postscript at bottom.... Well, I am giving this 4 stars because I can't just leave a comment without the stars, too--but really, I didn't make this per recipe.  I tried what someone else said worked for them--using applesauce instead of butter.  I also used a La Creuset pie dish and not a regular pie dish.  The result was not good! So disappointed.  It came out like rubber.  Taste was good, kind of mild, but really rubbery.  Sorry I tried it with apple sauce first, but was trying to accommodate a dairy-intolerant guest who is coming for dinner tomorrow. Big mistake.  I will try again the right way one day.
Afterthought:  Now I'm wondering if I didn't add the right amount of flour and sugar.  I was doing so many dishes at the same time (for Thanksgiving), so maybe that is the real reason it got messed up!!.....

Made this with only one small change: 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp almond extract. Still had a wonderful almond flavor. It was so good! We had it gone in a day. Made it again the other day. I didn't have enough cranberries, so I added chopped strawberries and apples so that I had 2 cups. Cut down the butter to 3 TBS and added 5 TBS of orange juice, and used only vanilla extract. Just as good as the original. Will keep and use both variations. Going to try it in mini muffin pan next time.

It is very tasty (if you like cranberries!) and easy to make.  It seems like a versatile recipe, too, so I may try it with different fruits and nuts.  Definitely will try with almonds instead of walnuts.  I also think it will present better baked in a square pan and cut into squares.  A dollop of whipped cream would be nice, but is great plain too, and with a cup of tea.

My 89 year old mother won't let a Thanksgiving go by without having this pie!  I made it for the last two years & everyone loves it!!!  I sometimes make it without nuts for some family members preferences, but when I use nuts I use pecans.  I'm going to take one of the other reviewer's suggestion & add orange zest next time

Like others suggested, I save about 1/2 cup of the berries and sprinkle them on top and then top with a crumb topping.  Delish!  I've also used blueberries in place of the cranberries and it is good that way too.

Made this 5 times in December for different functions. It tastes tart, sweet and buttery at the same time!  Only thing I changed: used 1 cup of walnuts. Easy to throw together, baked in a cute pie dish and served from there. Save a handful of the cranberries to spread on top of the dough. The popped cranberries make a beautiful presentation.

This was very good - I made a few changes to lighten it up and they worked: I used just 2 T butter and substituted the remainder of the butter with applesauce. I also substituted 1/2 cup of sweetener for 1/2 of the sugar.  I only had 12 oz of cranberries, but I think this could have used more like the recipe calls for.  Thank you for posting!

Wonderful!  Used almonds instead which worked great.  Went half and half with almond/vanilla extract and it was still slightly too almondy for our tastes.  Great texture and moistness.  No need for whipped cream or ice cream in my opinion:)  I will make this again and again!

We thought is was too tart at first bite, but then we quickly grew to like it. Liked it much more on days two and three.  Very moist.  Good as a morning bread.  Baked it in a 8x8 and used suggestion of almond and vanilla extract. Might add more sugar next time.

I made this recipe exactly as stated and it came out beautifully. My son and my neighbor loved it. Ok, well the only change I made was adding sliced almonds instead of walnuts; it just seems to make more sense since I used the almond extract. I'm visiting my parents home for the holidays and I can't wait to make it for them. I'm sure they'll love it as well.

I have made this recipe every Thanksgiving and Christmas since I found it on this site a couple years ago.
For family dinner and potluck. It has been a hit wherever I take it, I use frozen fresh berries and never have a problem.
This will continue o be a holiday favourite. 10+

This turned out surprisingly well!  I was a little skeptical when it didn't seem to fill the standard pie plate, but it spread while cooking.  I sprinkled a little brown sugar over the top before baking, which made for a little extra sweetness and mild crunch to complement the tartness.  I don't know about the leftovers, but fresh out of the oven with a little vanilla ice cream, this was delicious.

Great recipe but do not ever use frozen cranberries.  The minute you pour the melted butter over the berries, the butter hardens immediately.  I ended up microwaving the batter 30 seconds in order to soften the butter. Other than that, very easy to make

Great recipe and so easy. Made this for Thanksgiving and added a light butter sauce--everyone gobbled it up!  Sorry for the bad pun, I couldn't resist!

I have made this many times in the last 2 years.  I have made slight changes, 1 1/2 cups fresh cranberries, 1/2 white chocolate chips and I don't use any nuts b/c I don't like them.  Without the white chips I like to put the topping listed, brown sugar, flour and butter, on top.  Have the recipe ready, b/c it gets requested over and over.

Very tasty dish that is a good balance between sweet cake and tart cranberry tastes. I did not have almond extract so sub-ed orange extract instead. I liked the hint of orange. Baked it in a 8" sq pan for 46 min. This would make a good holiday coffee cake.

When I saw the picture of this dessert I thought it looked so good and easy to make and then I tasted it...it has a very strange texture that I was not expecting.

Very, very good.  Easy, simple ingredients, and different from a lot of holiday desserts.  I read other reviews and used the 1/4 t. almond, 3/4 t. vanilla and 1/2 t. orange extracts.  A full t. orange wouldn't have been too much, but I was being cautious the first time around.  I also used 1/2 c. lightly toasted almonds in place of the walnuts.  I baked it in an 8" square pan because it just sounded like a recipe that would cut better that way.

Quick and easy...used sliced almonds instead of walnuts.  Also reconstituted some dried cranberries instead of fresh or frozen. Still very calorie dense per slice, so next step is to try to lighten it up.

Most amazing "Crustless" pie I've ever had! I'm not a walnut fan, so I used slivered almonds. And it made this simple desert scrumptious. I make it every Thanksgiving and any time I want to impress! 
Thanks for this recipe!

Made this pie today. I followed the original recipe and it was perfect with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. So easy! If you like almond flavoring and the combination of sweet and tart, you will love this recipe. Will be making this again for Thanksgiving. Today was the trial run! Thanks for a great recipe.

I just made this for breakfast, it was very good and easy.  I only had a cup of fresh cranberries so I cut the big ones in half and it seemed like a perfect amount.  The almond extract is a must in my opinion, it balances the sweetness and sour and ties it all together, plus I love almond flavor!  Mine came out a bit gooey, just make sure you do the toothpick test, because I didn't, oops.  Very good, will make again if I have cranberries around, delish.

This was surprisingly good. It produced a decent sweet crust. The flavour is just tart enough for cranberry lovers. Even my DH who hates cranberries--asked for seconds! Very easy and quick to make. I only used 1/2 tsp almond extract--I think the whole amount would have been too much and would have overpowered the cranberry taste.i didn't have walnuts on hand so I used pecans--and was excellent!  Was still very good the next day. I will definitely make this again. Thank you Jean

It was a simple yet amazing recipe. My Dad and boyfriend who don't even like cranberries said it was reaqlly good and had seconds. I changed the recipe by only putting in 1/4 tsp of almond extract and 3/4 tsp of vanilla. Also, instead of walnuts I used pecans. So good! Thanks:)

This pie was a huge hit at a bible study of about twenty five people as well as a huge church event.  EVERYONE liked it and several people asked me for the recipe.  I did add the streusel topping from previous review adding 1/2 tsp.of ground cinnamon(also from a previous review) and sliced almonds instead of walnuts to streusel topping. I used 1/4 tsp.of almond extract and 3/4 tsp.of vanilla extract to recipe as well as added 1/4 tsp ground clove and 1/2 tsp.of ground cinnamon to batter(from previous review). Used only 12 oz. bag of fresh cranberries and that was plenty.  This pie is a keeper!!!

This was a pretty good, simple recipe. It is full of very tart cranberries in very sweet dense almond cake. I used almonds instead of walnuts because  thats what I had.  It took a bit longer for mine to bake in a ceramic pie dish and I ended up having to raise it up and increase the temp to get the top center to cook. I'd serve this as a breakfast cake rather than a desert.

We loved it! It wasn't quite what we were expecting, but it was delicious.  I loved the mixture of sweetness from the cakey part and tart from the cranberries.  We'll definitely make this again for other occasions.

I made this for my mother and I this Christmas. We both loved it! It's very tart, but also has the right amount of sweetness. I recommend a side of creamy vanilla ice cream. I will put this recipe in the keep pile.

Wonderful surprise.  I baked this in a 8" square casserole dish with an additional 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  i also did the topping thing by tossing walnuts with a little flour, melted butter and more brown sugar.  Turned out surprisingly good.  This really is for people who love the tart of cranberries and next time i will have it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, but this went great with coffee.

Absolutely amazing!! This pie is so moist and sweet and is very easy to make. The only thing I didn't have was walnuts, so I used pecans, and it was great! It's the kind of dessert that actually tastes better the next day. Oh and I added the struessel topping that some people mentioned -- it goes so well with this dessert. Also, I used fresh cranberries, so I'm not sure how different it would be with frozen. But my final product looked EXACTLY like the one in the picture above!!

This HAS to be a 5 star in my book. Stress Free deliciousness.    I didn't measure 2 cups of cranberries, I just used the whole bag.  It was really good, and everyone liked it.  Two family members ate it for breakfast, because it had fresh fruit in it.

This is the most unbelievably good dessert I have made in a while.  I have been cooking for 50+ years and have always been asked for my recipes.  This one though, I get asked for it from 90% of all attending.  The almond flavoring makes it addictive IMHO.  The only thing I change is I put 1 full cup of unchopped pecans and I like it better than with walnuts.  It definitely is tart, tart, tart!  I have made it 10 times in the last month. Love, love, love this recipe.

It came great but the taste was not that fantastic! It left somewhat bitter taste afterwards. I will try to make it again next time and use less cranberries. I think it's too bitter from the cranberries.

Awesome! This is so easy to make, and nice and moist. Great for adults as it's not real heavy on the sugar sweetness. Great for dessert or a snack. I sprinkle with a little powdered sugar to make it extra pretty...

I love this recipe. It's super easy and the almond extract perfectly accents the cranberries. I did take another reviewers advice and put the cranberries in the greased pan and poured the batter over them. It came out perfect. I left out the walnuts because I am not a walnut fan but it tasted great without them.

This was delicious!!  I didn't have any almond extract so I subbed amaretto and I only used 1 1/2 cups cranberries in it.  I thought it was wonderful. . .especially with whipped cream!  Yum, thanks so much for sharing!!

Thank you so much for posting!  I had a similar recipe, but had misplaced it, so I am thrilled to have your version. The only difference that I see is that I would drizzle pure maple syrup over the top while the pie was still hot out of the oven. This was my non-dessert eating nephew, Cole's favorate!  P.s.  I always use frozen whole cranberries.

I don't know what happened but 1 cup of sugar sure wasn't enough! It was definitely too tart to eat plain. After putting a ton of whipped cream on it, it was etible. If you are trying to watch calories, you will have a problem. I must say, this recipe would be FANTASTIC if the tartness could be fixed without more calories.

My whole family including children aged 7 - 17 loved this!  My husband said "Can you make this again?  As often as possible?!!"

The only modifications that I made was 1/2 tsp almond extract and 1/2 tsp vanilla and a crumble on top.  

I can hardly wait to try this with cherries and almonds!!

This "pie" is better suited as a breakfast bread or coffee cake.  It is simple and easy to make, very tasty but I am not rating so high because of the notion that it's called a pie.

Amazing recipe! I used sliced almonds instead of walnuts and it worked out so well! The smaller cranberries you use the better. I took it to my parents house for Thanksgiving and they loved it! My 2 year old helps me make it and loves the spoon! It doesn't last long!

This was excellent!  I left out the walnuts and subbed vanilla for the almond extract because someone in my family has a nut allergy.  I thought it was a pefect balance of sweet and tart.  The only problem I had was that it wasn't anywhere near done after 40 minutes,   I had to bake it for an hour.  It also stuck to the bottom of the pan pretty bad, so I'll have to make sure I grease the bottom of the pan really well next time.

Good but not great... missing something. Definitely try to find frozen strawberries and not dried. I added a tsp of cinnamon, which was good, but still did not drastically improve it. I think a streusel topping would help.

Quick and easy to make.  Very tasty with the almond and cranberry combo.  This has become a Christmas tradition with the family.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner at church and one for home-the first was a little too tart and the second I added half cup of suger and that helped-love the almond flavor! I am going to make another and will try cutting the cranberries so sugar will mix better-read another recipe review that the person did this and think it will work with this one.

I loved this recipe, and think it is very versatile. I didn't have almond extract, so I used about a tablespoon of finely grated lemon zest and it was delicious! I will definately try this again sometime with the almond extract- it's so easy to make and wonderfully sweet-tart. It does get soggy after a few days, so next time I will freeze it while it is very fresh so I can thaw it to have with tea or at breakfast. Thanks for this recipe- it is one of my new favorite recipes for cranberries!

If I could give this 10 stars I would!  I have been trying to find "my pie".  My mom-in-law brings the pumpkin, the neighbors have the pecan and now I have the Cranberry Pie.  YUM!!  I modified by using half cup whole wheat flour, lowered the almond extract and substituted for vanilla.  I also used almonds instead of walnuts.  This is a keeper.

I made this with 3 cups frozen blueberries.  Only had self-rising flour, so I left out the salt, and I forgot to add the extract.  Left out the walnuts because we don't like them.  This was excellent.  Will make it again trying it with other berries.

This is one of our favorite desserts.  It's more like a cake than a pie but no matter what it is, it's good.  As soon as fresh cranberries appear in our grocery, I make this pie.  It couldn't be easier and everyone loves it.  It's so festive and pretty with the bright red cranberries and the flavor is fantastic. Sometimes I sprinkle coarse sugar on the top just to give it a little crunch and added sweetness.

This recipe was ok. I used slivered almonds instead of walnuts and made a crumble on top. The "cake" part of it was strange - not quite a cake, not quite pie like

It was good, not great.  I guess I would rather call it a cookie bar or something instead of a pie.  I sent it to work with my husband, and he was confused as to what it actually was and had people tell him I should cook it longer.  I think I might eat it instead of coffee cake.  Very unique!

This pie is quick to make when unexpected company is at the door. Quick to make, easy and delicious! I served it warm with whipped cream. I got raves and requests for the recipe. I added 1/2 tsp. vanilla and 1/2 tsp. almond extract. Thanks for the great recipe.

This is delicious!  I made it this morning and loved it!   I doubled it (9x13 pan) and omitted the walnuts.  I added some turbinado sugar to the top for decoration.  Thanks Jean!

I substituted some rhubarb I had in the freezer from this summer for the cranberries.  I let it thaw and drain on paper towels so it wouldn't be too wet for the batter.  Can you say YUMMY!  My family loved it, it didn't last through the night.

First, I used blueberries instead of cranberries.  And, while it would have been better with Almond extract, I was out and used lemon extract instead.  Wouldn't recommend that.  This was nothing like a pie (unless you bake in a pie pan - then it's at least shaped like a slice of pie.)  It's a coffee cake.  Light?  Not mine.  I subbed Egg Beaters for the eggs and used the Splenda/sugar mix in place of all sugar.  Used pecans that had a sweet cinnamon glaze on them.  Chopped up smallish, but still didn't care for that texture in my coffee cake.  Kids wouldn't even give it a go.  I'll try a different coffee cake recipe next time (even though that's what it sounds like I did this time given all my substitutions:)  It was easy to make, however.  Sorry, Jean.

I really loved this and so did my whole family. Next time I will use a little less almond extract than called for, I thought it overwhelmed the dish a little.

Served it with a whip cream and cherry sauce, everyone thought it was wonderful.  The children especially liked it.  I agree it was more of a cake, and make it as cupcakes instead.  Turned out well.  The only reason for the 4 stars is that for just me, it was alright.  Very easy to make though!

I made this exactly as written and it was delicious; very tart, but my family loved it.  I think if I made it again I would put some sugar on the top before I bake it or make a crumb topping like another reviewer wrote about, definitely will make this again.

I tried this for dessert for Christmas and found it way too strong with the almond extract in it but I think it would be bland without it.  I made two pies and ended up throwing out 1 whole one and about 3/4 of the second one.  No one liked it.  I won't make this again.

This pie is really good!  It's not to sweet and not to tart.  The only change I made was to use 1/2 c wheat pastry flour and 1/2 c. white flour. This is a keeper!!

Loved this recipe. So unique and hits the spot. Its satisfying in one slice so you don't keep going back for more. I have made this 3 years in a row now and its become part of our Thanksgiving feast.

loved it. quick and easy. I used vanilla extract (all out of almond) I look foward into making this again. Updated. I love this pie with the almond extract as well I also made this pie with blueberries and with raspberries both turned out great. Just had a little longer bake time with the "juicier" berries.

A winner!  Made for Thanksgiving and everyone liked it, a few asked for the recipe!  I followed the directions exactly and it came out perfect!  I did serve with whipped cream and I think next time I will try the brown sugar and walnut topping that others suggested!

We're not much of a cranberry family but for some reason I really wanted to try this recipe. We were really surprised by it! I cut the recipe in half and baked it in a small pie tin, but wish I had made the whole recipe. It was enjoyed by all but 1 person. The cranberries are still a little tart and I don't believe any amount of sweet added will change that as that IS what cranberries are! But even with the tartness this is really quite good. I'm glad I tried this recipe, and will add this to my Thanksgiving menu from now on. Thank you for the recipe!

Love it!  So easy and a great way to use up cranberries.  I love the combos in this.  I didn't have enough almond extract, so I used some vanilla extract too, and it was great.  Thank you for the recipe!

I love cranberries and this was wonderful :-) I added a few spices, made the brown sugar topping and severed it with whipped cream. It was more of a cranberry cake than a pie- very yummy, but not a pie.

I served this tonight to 12 people and everyone liked it, several wanted the recipes. I was almost embarrased to give it to them, it was so simple to make:). It is an easy festive pie for the holiday season. Will definitely keep this one. I didn't change a thing.

Great but the name has been changed to protect the inocent. The only thing pie like is it is baked in pie plate. This is a great cake and as such has many ways to change from the basic recipe, I will make this again many times but most likley a little different each time, Different nuts , flavouring, and some suprize ingreadents. Thanks for the great recipe and the best recipe web site on the internet. I like the update also

So easy and delicious.  Everyone asks for the recipe and everyone loves it.  I make it without nuts and I only use one cup of cranberries, but cut them in half to spread the flavor around a bit.  Other than that, no changes.  Yummy!

When made with fresh cranberries this is the VERY best quick bread or cake I have tasted lately.  Everyone wanted the recipe when I made it at Christmas.  I tried it with reconstituted dried berries and it was edible, but not so good.  Stick to the fresh berries and enjoy.

This was too tart for me.  I used fresh cranberries, and maybe they weren't good ones?  I tried to eat the pie because I didn't want it to go to waste, and it was edible, but I won't make it again.  It's also a bit misleading to call it a pie.  It's more like a cake.

YUM! Easy and refreshingly different. My husband thought it was a little tart (maybe the struessal topping would help this) but I like desserts that aren't too sweet. I'll definitely make this again.

Good, but more like a coffee-cake baked in a pie-pan than a true pie. Lots of cranberries make this quite tart, so just be prepared, you might want to serve with ice cream or whipped cream.

This is a fabulous recipe. The almond flavoring sweetens it up perfectly. I think it's more of a "dessert bread" than a pie, though. But whatever you call it, it's definitely yummy!

It is sooooooo delisious!!! I used frozen cranberries and I added almond extract and some chopped almond and it made it even better. You can eat it warm or cold it's good both ways. I hightly recomend this recipe.
p.s. A week later I used bleuberries (frosen)instead of cranberries - didn't like it at all.

This has been a huge hit at two potlucks recently. Just disappeared in minutes. I tried to force vanilla ice cream on everyone but half of the people liked the pie without it.

So this crustless cranberry pie turned into crustless blackberry, blueberry, and exploded raspberry cake. But man oh man was it good. My grocery store did not have cranberry anything except as sauce, so we went with the berry mix, not realizing the raspberries would fall apart in stirring (even frozen!). Still, it was absolutely amazing, possibly my favorite recipe from this website yet. Highly recommond giving this a try. It's obviously foul proof!

Now I like cranberries, and I made this again. Its very good. Especially with some vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. 12/31/2008 My parents and their friends gave this 
5-Christmas stars for tastiest festive dessert. I however did not try it, because I do not like cranberries.

Wonderful!  We've had it both ways - as a pie and as bars, plain, cool whip, ice cream, warm and cold.  This is a great recipe.  The only thing we changed was to use pecans instead of walnuts.(I'm allergic to walnuts.  I think we'll try it next with blueberries or blackberries!

I followed the recipe as it was written but added vanilla in addition to the almond extract and used almonds instead of walnuts.  I also put sugar on top before baking.  The pie needed an extra 5 minutes of cooking time but it turned out fabulous!  I will be making this again!

really good! i added some mulling spice with cinnamon, cloves and a little nutmeg. i used pecans instead of walnut because it just what i had. also used some almond extract AND vanilla. turned out great. I also took the other cooks advice and added a nut/crumb topping. YUM! I tried this with blueberries and it was good too. i want to try with banannas.

Easy and delicious! This is a fabulous recipe and one of the easiest I've ever made. I have tried it several different ways now. I like to use an 8X8 square pan and call them Cranberry Bars. I also tried the recipe using Splenda instead of the sugar. The one with sugar was definitely better but the Splenda one wasn't bad. It had a smoother texture and sliced easier. I am going to experiment with a combination of Splenda and Sugar next time.

Because most of the reviews were very good, I started with a double batch. 7 people ate it and half loved it including me, the others thought it was a little tart for them, but still enjoyed it. Only one did not eat it.

I enjoyed this pie very much!  It has more of a cake texture than a pie texture.  It might be good with white chocolate chips in it too.  I put a brown sugar strudel on it and used almonds instead of walnuts (since I'm allergic to walnuts).  This would be good for a brunch dish as well.

Excellent.   I was suspicious because there was no leavening agent...but it was wonderful.  Not overly sweet...does not require either ice cream or whipped cream.

Um, this is in no way a pie. It is a cake. Super easy to do, but nothing super wonderful for me. I used half splenda and could taste it.  It definitely needs a little spice added to it.

Delicious - I didn't have almond extract, so I substituted 1/2 t. orange and 1/2 t. vanilla extract. That was great, but I'll try again with the almond. Thanks for sharing.

What a great surprise!  I had a bag of fresh cranberries left from Thanksgiving and thought I would try this easy recipe - am I ever glad I did.  The kids even enjoyed it warm from the oven with some fresh whipped cream.  Very tasty!

Wonderful! I was out of walnuts so skipped those, upped the cranberries to 2 1/2 cups and reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup. It was still sweet enough and a huge hit..

This was delicious, and super easy. It perfectly showcases the tart cranberries. I used maple extract instead of almond, and I added orange zest.

Delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly.  I don't know if I would call it a pie-it's more like a cake or even a large scone baked in a pie plate.  Nevertheless, it's DELICIOUS!  My daughter doesn't like cranberry dishes when they are too tart and this passed her test.  It was sweet and tangy without making your eyes water.  I am definitely bringing it to Thanksgiving!

This really is "the best." Very easy to put together and tastes wonderful when made as written. I wouldn't change a thing. I was surprised how much my teenaged children loved this recipe... they don't ordinarily like cranberries, but they ate almost the whole thing!

This was really good. I think it would be tasty with a crust, to kind of add to the flavor of the cranberries and almond extract. But I liked this pie.

Easy to make and delicious. I would serve this with a scoop of ice cream for dessert or even serve it with coffee for breakfast. The two cups of cranberries worried me that the end result would be too sour, but it is a great, sweet dessert with tang. The texture is like a cake. I did not have almond extract on hand, so I used vanilla extract and it tasted wonderful.

Good texture, quite sweet (could reduce sugar or replace some with brown).  Used hazelnuts instead of walnuts and I think the swtich worked better with the almond extract.  However, this is a CAKE not a PIE...I expected a somewhat creamy or more solid texture, but really this is just a dense cake in a pie pan.  With that in mind, it is good.

Absolutely delicious!  I substituted Splenda for the sugar and topped it with whipped topping.  My husband couldn't get enough.

Sorry, but this was not a pie. It was a large cookie.

This was okay, but definitely more like a fruitcake or a coffeecake than a pie.  I thought it came out rather heavy and dense, but that may be partly because I made it as a second dessert for Thanksgiving and refrigerated it until we were ready to cut into it.  It may have been better if served warm from the oven as suggested.

Delicious! I used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and some brown sugar and I mixed in whole and chopped cranberries with walnuts. I also made whipped cream (equal parts heavy cream, confectioners sugar, vanilla extract; beat until it thickens up and peaks form). My boyfriend doesn't really like cranberries and he loved this pie! I'll definitely make it again since I still have 2 1/2 lbs of cranberries in the freezer.

So easy to make, and my co-workers gobbled it up. Good flavor, and not to sweet or heavy.

This is good and everyone liked it, I also made it last year using canned cherries which I personally liked better.

Hubby says a 5, but I thought a 4. Taste is fine, it is real easy, but I didn't notice anything for the wow factor.

I completely changed the fruit, but the basic pie was quite tasty. I added a little cinnamon, and I cut the sugar in 1/3 as I used sweet fruit. I made this with very ripe fuyu persimmons cut in large chunks (about the size of cranberries) and it was very nice. Mild and sweet. I omitted the nuts 'cause I forgot to buy more and was too lazy. I think next time I'll microwave the fruit a bit first as I'd like it to turn out softer. I like this and will keep playing with it - I like the muffin suggestion

I made this dessert with fresh cranberries that I had frozen and it worked out wonderfully. I also doubled the recipe, which worked well. In fact, I passed on the recipe to six other people who liked it so much they requested a copy!!

Wow!  Fabulous!  It reminds me of a very moist and tender scone.  It was so good I couldn't stop eating it.  I added a bit more cranberries because I had too many and wanted to use them up, also I added more sugar to balance the tartness. I will make this again, for sure!!  YUMMY!
