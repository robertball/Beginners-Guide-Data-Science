Delicious! I wasn't sure how the seasonings were gonna stick after the bread was already toasted, but the addition of the cheese helped the seasonings to coat each crouton nicely. I just eyeballed all the seasonings to taste. Nice, buttery and flavorful~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

A very good, simple crouton. I melted the butter and put the cubes and seasonings in a bag, poured the butter over top and shook to coat. Toasted in the oven after seasoning. Came out great and no issues with the seasoning sticking

These were excellent!  I could have just eaten them by themselves.  Made these for some zucchini soup and it paired great with it!

Excellent recipe, will be my go to. Next time I will cut salt to 1/2 tsp. Way too salty for me and I used garlic powder. Otherwise easy perfect.

11-06-15 ~ Quick and easy croutons. The flavor was very good, but I had trouble getting the garlic cheese mixture to stick to the cubes. I would make this recipe again.

These were so good that they were barely around long enough to make it into the salad!

So good! Many of them have not even seen a salad but were excellent on salad too. We've been snacking on them all along since I made them! Made them exactly as the recipe stated using a loaf of sliced French bread for a double recipe and baked in two batches! Yum!

Not sure if I'll ever buy croutons again! I mixed the seasoning with the butter before baking. Then toss a bit more of the seasoning after they were baked! Delicious!! Can't wait to make these again!

What's not to love: Butter, Garlic Powder, Cheese and Bread! I didn't have any paprika and I didn't need it. I used English muffins, white and rye breads for my first (won't be my last) batch.  Yummy.
