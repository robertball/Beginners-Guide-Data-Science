I love this recipe!  I found it on allrecipes last winter and then lost it.  Because of the funky name, it was just about impossible to find again, and I was so excited to come across it recently.  This is a great winter dinner - I use just one big skillet which makes cleanup so simple.  The simmering always takes longer than I remember, but it fills the house with a great smell and everyone is so eager to eat when ready.  A few variations: I don't grate the tomatoes, just chop since they cook down so much anyway.  I definitely do remove the lid and let simmer down, and I love the potatoes after mashed.  Remember that the larger chunks your potatoes are in, the longer the cooking process will be.  I've also added black and red beans   to the tomato/onion mixture.  I've used both fresh and frozen fish fillets (pollock, cod, want to try catfish) and they work equally well.

I loved this!  I used a white fish called turbot, recommended at the seafood counter, and substituted 1/2 white cooking wine for 1/2 of the water.  Next time I will make the potato wedges thinner because they definitely didn't cook enough in 20 minutes and I worried about overcooking the fish while waiting for the potatoes to be ready.

I am hoping to get some questions answered.  First, in the description of the recipe, there is mention of lots of parsley, but parsley is not in the list of ingredients, nor is there any mention of adding it in the instructions.  Second, and less importantly, the recipe says to cook the onion and tomato in half of the olive oil, but I don't see where the rest of the olive oil is used.  Any answers or thoughts are appreciated!

Very good!  I found that four medium potatoes were more than enough, and the top-most potatoes didn't get cooked all the way through even with an extra 20 minutes of cooking.  Next time I might cook the potatoes for a bit before putting in the fish, as the cod fillets made it harder to stir the stew.  Still, a great recipe overall!

I agree with some of the other comments...thinner wedges so it cooks a bit quicker and also to take the lid off to reduce some of the juice. I used New Zealand lemon sole and added more garlic, it turned out really tasty and I have submitted a photo of the dish as there was none posted when I cooked it. There is a querie from someone else who posted a review regarding what to do with the parsely....I just ripped it up and put it on top of dish when serving.

I would like to rate this recipe higher, but it is so poorly written that I just can't.  Heat half the oil and cook the onion and tomato? Okay. Heat/cook where? Stove or range? What heat setting? What was I supposed to do with the other half of the oil? Was I supposed to mash the potatoes for the recipe, or just with my spoon for greater eating pleasure?  I followed the ingredients exactly except that I used a pound of red potatoes cut in chunks to reduce the cook time instead of 8 large potatoes, which wouldn't have fit the pot anyway. I simmered for 30 minutes. At the end, I mashed half the potato chunks with the dish uncovered and still cooking to thicken it slightly. I never figured out when to add the rest of the oil, so I never did! It came out VERY spicy, possibly because it's missing some oil. How this is only 4 servings is beyond me. It makes a ton! Tasty, simple, and comforting. I'd make it again and add a green vegetable to the pot.

I cut the ingredients in half and used Tilapia instead of Cod. I also added a bit of garlic. I served it over Orzo pasta with a salad on the side. It came out quite wonderful and everyone enjoyed it! Thank you!

I honestly thought the recipe was just okay.  Nothing amazing, however the fish was very good.  I would suggest putting the potatoes in the microwave first so they cook completely.

This was easy, great and very filling. I used pollock instead of cod and added a little garlic. I served it with croissants and grated romano cheese. Whole family loved it.

My husband and I love this recipe!  I have made it a few times now...tried with cod first - but then tried tilapia (which was our favorite).  We eat it like a soup - adding avacado, cilantro and lime juice before eating!  It is wonderful with the french bread - and we also make mexican rice with it.  Sooooo good!  ***I only use 1/2 the amount of potatoes (cut them up and cook them a little in the microwave first) - and just chop my tomatoes and onions instead of grating.  Much easier and no difference in the taste!!  : )  Great recipe!!!

Use red or white boiling potatoes and they will be done (not baking potatoes).  I used the food processor for the onions and tomatoes instead of grating them and that worked fine.  Instead of cayenne, I used Johnny's Grub Rub sprinked on the fillets (it has cayenne in it), and put garlic salt and black pepper on the potatoes.  I'll try adding a bay leaf and some herbs next time.  I liked the one-pot (skillet) method and it was very good.  Oh, I did research - after done, drizzle with the rest of the olive oil and sprinkle some chopped fresh parsley on top, and serve with sourdough bread.

This was a good dish, but I've had better. Maybe it was just the way I cooked it but the recipe could be better explained as well. I didn't know if I had to mash the potatoes or not, then the fish was kind of mushy, I didn't cover it like the reviews said. I didn't have enough tomatoes either. It was a good dish and I will definitely make it again, hopefully it will be closer to perfection next time.

Absolutely gorgeous. The potatoes absorbed the spice of the cayenne pepper perfectly, really had that lovely little kick to them. I swapped out the cod for haddock, I admit, but was a little disappointed because it didn't absorb the flavour anywhere near as much as the potatoes did. Nonetheless, I thoroughly enjoyed this meal, and I can't wait to eat it again!!

My husband, who likes his food HOT enjoyed this.  I did add a fresh cayenne pepper and 1/2 of a ghost pepper for his tastes. After reading reviews about potatoes taking longer to cook, I used the smaller white potatoes and used frozen tilapia and cod. Fresh is always better, but the frozen was what I had and it worked well with the longer cooking time allowing it to defrost while cooking the potatoes and fish completely. My husband suggested trying couscous or lentils in place of potatoes next time, just to change it up.
