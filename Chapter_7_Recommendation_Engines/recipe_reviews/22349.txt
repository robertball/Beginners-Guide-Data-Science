Good, but like other reviewers said, it was missing something so I added about 1/2 to 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese and doubled the hot sauce.  Even better with these additions.

This recipe gets five stars with just a few minor modifications.  I used 1/4 cup corona beer, melted 8 oz of cream cheese, and mixed it with the paprika as called for.  However, I doubled or even tripled the amount of hot sauce, used a cup of 4 cheese mexican blend shredded cheese, and 1 small can of slice black olives.  To quote my husband..."YUMMY!"  I served this with pretzels.

I added a couple of black olives & a little more hot sauce for a kick. I would also recommend using a light beer; it was too strong with a dark beer.

This is a great recipe that I found easy to "tweak" to my own tastes!  I added much more hot sauce because I like a lot of kick.  It's easy and takes ingredients that I always have on hand.

I wanted to serve this cold with pretzels so I didn't heat the cream cheese I just used the beaters....either way it was excellent and a big hit at the party.  This will be added to my recipes!!!!

My family didn't think it was very good. I added some extra shredded cheddar cheese, as mentioned by one of the other reviewers. Probably won't make this again.

This dip is missing something, I'm not sure what. All I can taste is cream cheese and paprika. I'd love to make this again, I'll just have to play around with it though.

Easy and very tasty cheese dip - I've made this several times for pot lucks with bread and veggies to dip in it and it always gets great compliments!

As it is posted it seems like it was missing something. I made a second batch but used Chile Powder instead of Paprika, added two hand fulls of sharp chedder and the recipe was great then.

For the beer I used a Central Waters Satin Solitude Stout.

So easy and very good!  Next time I think I'll reduce the hot sauce and up the heat with dry spices.  The hot sauce added to much of a vinegar-y taste for my liking.  But it was still so good, it didn't last long enough to find out what it tastes like when cold!

Easy and good...Reduce the paprika, I think. 

Also, MUCH better when served warm. I served it chilled first, and it didn't go over to well with my crowd -  until I threw it in the microwave with a little bit of milk to thin it. After that it was a hit!

Good base, added onion powder Mexican shredded cheese, and black pepper.
