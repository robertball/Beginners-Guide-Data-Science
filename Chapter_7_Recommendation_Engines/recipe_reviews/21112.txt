Excellent! A very simple,tasty,unique recipe, but I would recommend the following: (1) Although the receipe indicates "6 servings", one and one half pounds of ribs with the bone in is really "2 servings". Adjust accordingly. (2) The sauce is fabulous, but the original recipe just doesn't give you enough. I would triple the amounts listed, so you have plenty of sauce to serve over the ribs. It's no problem, the ingredients are simple and cheap. (3) The sauce will burn easily, so if you like to grill the ribs like I do over medium-high heat, baste the ribs only during the last 5 minutes of grilling.

I changed the cooking method for this recipe because I wanted to cook my country style ribs in the slow cooker. I was concerned that the cinnamon would become too strong with the long cooking, so I left it out but tossed everything else in the slow cooker, turned it on and left it all day. I thought it tasted really good. The mustard cuts the sweet of the cranberry sauce perfectly.

These tasted GREAT.  I did bake the ribs instead of grilling though and it took longer than 60 minutes, but the ribs were REALLY thick ones.  I would double the sauce next time, as what I had was just enough to pour over the ribs for cooking.  And the flavor gets better in the leftovers (if you have any)!

The sauce was the best part of this recipe.  I found the meat not to be as moist and tender as I would like.  I found I needed to cook the ribs longer than the time recommended in the recipe.

These turned out really good, although not as zesty as I like pork ribs to be. I felt like it needed vinegar or something. I also had to thin the sauce with a little orange juice to make it more brushable. I think this would be a great glaze for pork roast, maybe with some herbs... Thanks for the recipe.

My boyfriend and I just started to cook more at home and we found this recipie to be very tasty and easy to cook. But 45-60 minutes seemed like a long time for ribs. We took it off after about 30 minutes. We also doubled the basting sauce recipie for 2 lbs of pork ribs and we had just a little bit left over. Everything turned out great!

Love Cranberries!I buy several bags of fresh when available and freeze for future use.  Fpr this recipe I boiled up approx 1 c fresh Cranberries, removed enough berries before straining to sprinkle over meat after cooking.  Straining left me a nice clear glace which is what I was after.  This is also totallt yummy on chicken breasts and rotisserie chicken - place glaze on chicken about 30 min's before cooked - also makes a delic marinade

I used boneless pork ribs for this recipe and set it to cook in the crock pot. I had to thicken it up before serving with just a slurry of apple sauce and corn starch. I didn't add the orange zest until right before serving because I didn't want it to get rancid and turn in the crockpot. My youngest would not eat it and both my husband and I were underwhelmed. The only person who liked it was my oldest boy and he'll eat just about anything. I'm sure this would be better on bone-in ribs, but I doubt it.

Did not love this recipe at all.  Did not do on BBQ and that may have been the problem.  I cooked it in the oven and the sauce was watery.  My family did not like the taste of the "glaze."  Sorry.  It seemed like a wonderful variation for ribs but we won't be making this again.  I did give it 2 stars because it may have been better on the grill.  I'll never know...

This was quick and easy.  I had Trader Joes Cranberry Orange relish, added the mustard and a little balsamic vinegar and white wine (did not heat).  Put this over boneless country pork ribs covered and baked for an hour at 350 and then took lid off for 15 minutes more.  Excellent flavor and tender moist meat. - Linzo
