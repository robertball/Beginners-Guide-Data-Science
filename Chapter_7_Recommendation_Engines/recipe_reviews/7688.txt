This icing tasted pretty good - warning! Spread the icing as soon as you make it, because it really firmsup. Any attempt to soften it will ruin it. It only took 3 seconds of heat to turn the whoe batch into liquid.

This is the most incredible frosing I have ever tasted! I am a huge fan of merangue, so this is a real hit. My whole family LOVED it. My 16 year old brother who doesn't cook, wanted me to show him how to make it so he can whip up a batch in case I'm not around. :)Whoever came up with this is brilliant!!!

This recipe is quick, tasty, and fat free. At high altitudes a double boiler is not necessary, just don't over cook it or it will harden/dry out faster, keep it covered until ready to use. Any flavoring can be used in place of vanilla, and juice can be used instead of the water for an orange or lemon frosting, using zest in place of the vanilla, also you can stored this frosting in the fridge for at least a week in an air tight container. Enjoy!

This frosting came out more like marshmallow fluff than anything else. It was tasty, but oh-so-sticky! It was difficult to wrap the cake afterwards.

I love this kind of frosting, A much easier way to do this is to mix 2 egg whites and half of a small can of lyles gold syrop(or something similar.) until fluffy :) doesnt need cream of tartar or anything .

Good fluffy white frosting. This better known as"7-Minute" frosting as you usually beat if for 7 minutes. This does not keep so you should eat it within a day.

My aunt Leona Lamusga made this when I was a little girl.  My mom never made it, so it was a special treat from Aunt Lee.  Thank you for bringing back a wonderful memory of an Aunt I loved very much.  And, I have never made this successfully until following your recipe.

Awesome recipe.  Also you can substitute rose water or orange water for the water to give it a unique 'nectar of the Gods' flavor.  Amazing.

Angle food cake with boiled frosting was a my birthday cake of choice as a child. When the grocery stores took the boxed frosting mix off the shelves my aunt stopped making it for me. Today I celebrated my 40th birthday and my partner made me an angle food cake with this frosting. It looks behaves and tastes exactly like the cake from my childhood. Absolutely the best and thanks to my wife for making me such a sentimental birthday cake!

This is so delicious!  I served it on yellow cake but there are so many possibilities.  It would be yummy with flavors other than vanilla...lots of possibilities.  It took a little more than 5 minutes to get to the "fluffy" stage.  I frosted the cake immediately and then refrigerated it.  It held up well in the fridge for the two days before it was all gone!

I love this icing...I've had failures before with similar style icings, but this was so easy, it was essentially a no-brainer!  This will be a permanent addition to my repetoire!  Thanks Carol!

Divine on Angel food cake!  Tastes very much like marshmellows.  I added coconut extract and sprinkled toasted coconut on top of my cake.  Light and fluffy...and no fat!  As for the left over yokes, save them to glaze homemade bread or pastries before baking.

This may be the "7 Minute" or "White Mountain" icing", and definitely does take at least 7 minutes to reach the consistency that's needed.  It is WONDERFUL on a Devils Food cake, too. You may have problems making the icing if the humidity is high. It's like Devinity.  It can be made using the brown sugar, chocolate, cherry, etc., flavors, so check recipe books or online sites. Old cookbooks are a good start.

Light and elegant. i used it to ice an angel food cake for my firneds wedding shower, then i decorated it with edible sugared flowers. very pretty. the icing is glossy and sinful, but with ZERO FAT! imagine that ladies! it was gobbled up. 
As a side note, if you like coconut, this also goes GREAT on a coconut layer cake. sprinkle it with toasted shredded coconut and its reminiscent of those toasted cocnut mallow cookies i ate as a kid.
enjoy!

This was really good, the recipe makes a lot of icing.  When you first mix all the ingredients together, it is very thin, don't be afraid,keep mixing and it it will thicken up nicely.  It tastes like a cross between meringue and marshmallow.

My first attempt at making icing of any kind, had to look up double boiler so as a novice I would say 2 things I was unsure of were the corn syrup ingredient...was that meant to be light or dark? Next I did the glass bowl over saucepan alternative to a double boiler but didn't realize the icing was going to expand so greatly so I should have used a much bigger size...LOL Flavor was very sweet even without the vanilla. Not sure if I like it better with or without. Will try again and with more knowledge now and maybe even go with a raspberry flavor...hmmmm

Such a beautiful icing.  Had a silky, kind of pearl finish...it looked SO good on cupcakes and it was really easy to make.  The flavour is pretty good...I will probably try an extract other than vanilla next time but I will definitely use this recipe over and over again!

Easy to prepare. I'm going to try adding chocolate or cocoa to the next try. It spreads well onto the cake or even piping.

Amazing!  Wonderful!  I've had to make two cakes in 3 days just because the family wanted more icing.

Very Good ... mixer broke half way through so I whisked very fast lol and attempted so it was quite sloppy and not the fault of the recipe it still tastes great!

This was pretty good and fairly easy (though a little time consuming) to make.  I would have like for it to have a little more flavor though.  I might try orange extract next time.

I was looking for the icing recipe my grandmother used to make, this was very close! I would say this is more of a marshmellow consistency then meringue. I made this icing for a 3 layer round hot milk cake, strawberry shortcake. Everyone at the party raved over it. Excellent Recipe! Make sure you don't give up on the beating, it takes a good while to get the desired consistency, expecially if you double or triple the recipe.
