I made these with my two boys. We used chunky peanut butter and mini chocolate chips. My kids and I had a blast making these and they INHALED them. Great quick snack with pantry ingredients.

Ok heres the deal....I didn't make this but my mom has been making this for years and years. But with one addition....she added a little bit of rice krispies! And I am not sure what milk powder is...she used malt powder. For every play date, quick snack, late night sleep over.....whatever the occasion, she would whip these up and they are so good. This recipe brings me back 15 years to my childhood. Thanks for sharing, I think I am going to make these!

This is a tasty recipe. I like that it uses powdered milk for the crunch instead of graham crackers. This is not intended to replace peanut butter balls candy (in which graham crackers are entirely welcome) so if you're looking for that flavor, this might not be the recipe for you. As a reasonably high-protein, tasty sweet snack, these hit the spot. FYI, use milk chocolate chips, semi-sweet tastes a bit out of place with the honey IMO! Thanks for sharing your recipe!

My husbands grew up on peanut butter balls and I've been hunting for a recipe we could both enjoy. These ratios are perfect. 

The other recipes I've tried were too sweet or had artificial ingredients. Good peanut butter flavor without being over-poweringly sweet. 

I skipped the chocolate chips but used natural peanut butter and honey from Trader Joe's. You can really taste the difference with quality ingredients.

These were okay. I am not really sure why they are called power balls though? Maybe, because of the peanut butter? I really despise powdered milk in raw recipes, as it dominates the flavor. So, I used cake flour in its place. It made them taste like peanut butter and chocolate chip cookie dough. I used natural pb and mini chocolate chips. I changed the servings to 6 with the calculate button and got 7 pb balls. It did satisfy my sweet craving, anyhow.

Simple recipe.  I used all natural peanut butter, and fat free skim milk powdered, and these are still sweet and wonderfully tasty.  The texture is perfect, and my fiance LOVED them.  COuldn't tell the difference between these and the fatty ones.  I consider that a huge success!

so simple, fast, and delicious!  this is the peanut butter ball recipe my mom used to make as well (though, we never thought to put chocolate chips in the mix - DUH!)  i love the consistency.  perhaps i made the balls more like 2 tablespoon scoops, but the recipe only yielded 11 power balls for me.  i used poplar honey instead of clover, and i think they would've tasted better with regular ol' clover honey.  brings back childhood memories!

We bring these to swim meets for a quick protein pick-me-up. They travel well - They freeze well and defrost easily in a lunch box.  I substitute Chocolate protein powder in place of the milk powder to increase the protein.

 I also have rolled them in crushed chocolate or honey graham crackers, have added crushed walnuts. Swapped raisins for the chocolate chips, and have used crunchy peanut butter for more crunch. This recipe has endless possibilities and is great no matter what you put in it.

Like everyone else, my Mom made this for years and years too.  Milk Powder is the same as nonfat dry milk.  I want to try this with graham crackers.  Is this added instead of dry milk or in addition to?

I used half peanut butter, half chocolate peanut butter. I dipped them in a melted chocolate and allowed them to set in the refrigerator. My kids loved them.

My preschooler had fun making these with me, and she liked taking small bites while helping. I’m not a big fan of powdered milk in peanut butter balls, but the ratio of peanut butter, honey and milk powder is much better in this recipe than in another one I tried. I had to add just a little bit of powdered sugar so that the dough wasn’t too sticky and we could roll them right away.
