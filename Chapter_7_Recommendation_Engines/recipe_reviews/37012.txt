I make these all the time and they are absolutely delicious.  I don't see how there could be a bitter taste as the other reviewer noted.  If you follow the directions you will have a marvelous cocktail.  I cut the watermelon into ice cube size chunks and freeze it and then use that in the blender with other ingredients.  I have also used Nellie's key Lime Juice instead of fresh but fresh juice is better.  Very YUMMY!

There was a bitter quality to it.  Nobody liked it and we all switched to beer.
