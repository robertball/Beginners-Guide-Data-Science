This easy dish was very tasty.  I made some substitutions to cut saturated fat.  I used olive oil instead of butter and added 2 tablespoons of butter buds.  I also used dried tarragon.  I doubled the sauce.

This was a great and quick recipe.  I did not have rasberry vinger so I used apple.  It turned out great.  I would make a little extra dressing to sprinkle over fish after it comes out the brolier. My husband and I both enjoyed this very much.  Thank you!

2/24/19 - subbed pomegranate aged balsamic in place of the vinegar - delicious!

4/28/2016 - super easy and flavorful, my daughter threw this one together when I asked her to make dinner the other night.  Everyone loved it!

12/13/2004 - This sauce had great flavor - my husband used bread to soak up the leftovers!  Very easy, low fat and delicious!

This was good.  YOU NEED TO DOUBLE THE SAUCE RECIPE~I didn't.  The bites that had the sauce richly drizzled on them were really good! I used Olive oil instead of butter.

I made this recipe with chicken breast and tripled the recipe for 5 chicken breasts, I poked holes throughout the chicken and marinated the chicken in the sauce first. It turned out very good. I don't much like tarragon though, so I will try anotherherb next time.

Super Yummy!  DH commented several times how good it was.  It had a nice smokey flavor from the broiler.  I was out of raspberry vinegar so I used pomegranate vinegar instead.  It was so quick and easy.  Will definitely keep this one in the rotation.  Thanks for sharing!

I doubled the dressing recipe- and am very glad I did, it's fantastic!  It's like a light tasting/ delicate honey mustard sauce.  I think it complements the fish very well.  The only other changes I made were out of necessity- I used apple cider vinegar instead of raspberry vinegar, which I did not have, and I used dried tarragon instead of fresh tarragon for the same reason.  I will definitely make this again!

Excellent! We are not big fish eaters, but this is healthy and good.  I did not coat foil with butter, just sprayed it with olive oil. Used dill instead of tarragon.

So easy and super delicious. My husband loved it. Substituted raspberry vinegar with apple cider vinegar, and doubled the sauce amount so I had lots to pour over the fish. Seasoned the tilapia with salt and pepper then, poured the sauce over it. Baked, instead of broiled for 15 min. at 350 degrees.

We eat a lot of tilapia... I don't know if I'll do this again because one of my Chickies thought it tasted too sweet.  I said "it's suppose to".... but if she is happier with lemon/pepper, who am I to argue?  LOL

My new favorite! Cut some fat by replacing the butter with EVOO. Had no vinegar (yuck) so I used raspberry jam. Also no tarragon so replaced with dill. I also added a bit of marjoram and basil. Delicious! I think this recipe would also be great on chicken.

Fabulous!  My only suggestion is to make extra dressing and drizzle it on again, once it is served onto the plate.  The dressing is delicious.  Very simple to make.  I used rice vinegar and strawberry jam in place of the rasberry vinegar.

Definitely an excellent starter fish recipe. I'm not a big fish fan but I will be cooking this again. I agree olive oil could be easily substituted. I don't think making more sauce is necessary, the flavors baked right into the fish and was incredible.

This was a disappointment, especially in light of the other glowing reviews.

Our problem was the mix of two many flavors, most of which were uncomplimentary to each other. Butter and honey? Butter and lemon juice? Butter and raspberry vinegar? Lemon juice and Dijon mustard? Even my husband, who inhales anything you put on a plate (especially fish) thought this was marginal. 

I'm in the minority here, but am glad I tried this. It could've worked.

quick and easy; definite taste of raspberries for such a small "dose". Watch time closely--mine didn't take the full time broiling and would have been very dry if done for the full two minutes the second time over.

I didn't use the lemon juice, substituted olive oil for butter, used regular vinegar, added a splash of worcestershire sauce, used italian seasoning instead of tarragon, and the fish was delicious! The sauce was the perfect amount. The only thing I would do is add a little more honey, since it's the only source of sweetness in my version

This gets 5 stars for the dressing...talk about multiuse! Just finished making it and it's absolutely fantastic! Scaled down to 2 servings so I can have lunch tomorrow, subbed olive oil for the melted butter as COOKIE7 suggested and it didn't take long to cook at all. Next time I'm making the full amount of dressing so I can have more to drizzle over the finished product. YUM!

We had this for dinner last night and it was awesome! My husband prefers his fish spicy, but even he admitted that he liked this. I did use olive oil instead of butter. I served this with an almond rice pilaf, which soaked up the extra sauce wonderfully. Can't wait to have this again.

Okay this recipe is AMAZING! Simply delicious! We loved it so much I made it two nights in a row! I used NO butter, and it still turned out wonderful--and low fat (I'm on weight watchers). So far I've tried it on Tilapia and Salmon ... and can't wait to try it on chicken and shrimp! It's so easy to make, and just simply divine! Def. a new base recipe in my kitchen!!!!! A must try!!

This was a delicious, easy recipe.  I really DON'T like mustard, but you couldn't taste it at all.  I agree with doubling the recipe to have more sauce.  You also don't really need the butter in the bottom of the foil...maybe just a sprinkle of olive oil.  I think I'll also try it on different types of fish.

Great recipe! The store didn't have raspberry vinegar, so I crushed 4 raspberries into it, using white wine vinegar. I think the berry pulp is a good addition. I now make the recipe x6 and keep it in the fridge.  I used it on pork last night and have raspberry anointed chicken in the oven tonight. I skipped the buttering of the foil and nothing stuck. With the pork and chicken, I just spoon the sauce over the top and bake without turning. Thanks so much for sharing the recipe.

Wonderful meal. Everyone loved the flavor of the Tilapia, remarking on what the Dijon mustard did for the overall flavor. We will have this again.

This was just OK.  The marinade smelled wonderful but I think that b/c the fish isn't marinated in the flavours it's too mild of a taste for me.

Fabulous. Second time this week I've made it. I didn't have lemon, used lime and no tarragon, but still delectable.

Excellent! I didn't have tarragon or raspberry vinegar on hand, but couldn't wait to try this recipe so I substituted dried dill and apple cider vinegar. It came out perfectly (and I admittedly have not had much success with broiling in the past.) This is now my favorite tilapia recipe!

Ehh.  This was just ok.  The addition of fresh tarragon is a nice touch, but perhaps the dressing itself needed less 'sweet' and more 'tangy' for tilapia.  Might try this again with adjustments..... thanks!

This recipe is quick and easy. The fish was cooked perfectly and the flavors all blended together. We substituted fresh basil for the tarragon and it came out perfectly!

Made some substitutions, so rating 4 stars.  DOUBLE OR TRIPLE THE SAUCE!  I used Olive Oil instead of butter, omitted the Dijon mustard, and used raspberry vinegrette salad dressing.  Delicious!  The kdis and hubby loved it.  I do not eat seafood, and I enjoyed it.  Wow-will make again!

Very good meal that is served in less than 30 minutes. I maid only one modification to this recipe. I doubled the sauce,except for honey used original amount. We found that to be a good balance of sweet and tangy. Enjoy as are family did.

My husband and I loved this tilapia. No tarragon or raspberry vinegar in my kitchen tonight so we used balsamic and basil instead.  A little sweet, but I liked it that way!

Great flavour combination. 

I did make adjustments to suit our preferences based on reviews and experience. 

Based on the recipe I agreed with other reviewers that it wouldn't make much sauce. So I kept the sauce measurements even when halving the number of serving sizes. I also cooked the fish in a baking dish lightly coated with butter cooking spray instead of on flat foil to keep the sauce and other juices. 

I did not have any raspberry vinegar at the moment, so instead used balsamic with a tsp of raspberry vodka. Worked FAR better than I could have hoped.  

I agree with the reviewer that one barely tastes the mustard. We adore dijon mustard so I used 2 tsp. (effectively quadrupling the proportion of mustard) and the taste was still fairly subtle. It was a good balance of flavours for us. 

I did not feel that salt or pepper were necessary. 

I served with white rice, steamed french beans and cauliflower gratinee, 

Thanks for the inspiration TINATED!!!

We really enjoyed this dish. I made a lot of  substitutions, I used olive oil for all the butter like other people suggested. I didn't have Dijon so I used Honey Mustard. I didn't have Raspberry vinegar so I used Blasamic vinegar. I didn't have honey so I omitted it. I didn't have tarragon so I used dill. Instead of putting it under a broiler, we wrapped it in foil spread some of the sauce on it and cooked it on the grill. It seems like a lot of substitutions but it still worked out GREAT! We will be making this again.

Really good & easy! I did make a couple of subs: olive oil for butter, basil instead of tarragon, pomegranate vinegar instead of raspberry as it was what I had on hand. I would reccomend upping the sauce quantity a bit, not double but a bit more. I served it over sauteed spinach & arugala and brown rice. Definitely reccomend!

Yummy!  My hubby even called this one a "keeper."  I doubled the sauce as others had suggested to serve on top of the fish after cooking.  I also used the sauce on a veggie-pasta salad with feta cheese.  Definitely a wonderful, quick and easy meal!

A good recipe for a mild fish.  I only broiled three fillets of tilapia yet kept the sauce ingredients as is.  If you have more fish, absolutely double the sauce.

I thought this was good and very easy to make... but my boyfriend thought it was okay.... he wanted to taste more of the vinegar.... and more of a tangy taste I think doubling the sauce is a good idea beacause I barely has enough to cover the fish.  I also added a tsp of parsley to the sauce.

Followed the recipe as written, aside from substituting apple cider vinegar and 1/2t dried tarragon, sprinkling the tilapia with a tiny bit of lemon pepper seasoning prior to the first flip, and only using the 1t lemon juice in the sauce, which that sauce is just about plate-lickin good.  Great dinner.

I used raspberry vinegrette dressing instead and no tarragon.  It was super yummy anyway.  Just the right flavor mix for the delicate fish.  Will definitely make again.

Not a keeper for me. I doubled the sauce like others suggested. It smelt amazing and I thought the sauce was very very good.  The flavors did not soak into the fish though. All put together, it was bland. I took it for lunch with me the next day and it was even worse. The sauce lost all of it's taste.

I let my fillets sit in the sauce for an hour before broiling and I then made some extra for the table.  The taste is faint but good.  Definitely out of the norm for us.  I'll keep this one in my recipe box and break it out from time to time.  Thanks for getting us out of our comfort zone.

Good, but not amazing. Tasted better than I expected from looking at the ingredients, though. Used Apple Cider vinegar rather than raspberry and it turned out well.

Eric said he enjoyed the sweet/light taste of the dressing. As others recommended I doubled the sauce. My photo is very beige -  I used up the leftovers of Basmati rice and Cauliflower with Dijon sauce.

Light and different. Doubled the sauce, only used butter for sauce, added a teaspoon Marsala wine.  No need to use that much butter on the foil, sprinkle some olive oil instead.  I also alternated the heat between broil and 400.

good recipe. very easy with a great, light sauce. i read the reviews and used apple cider vinegar instead of the raspberry, and i didn't have any tarragon, so i just omitted it. it was still great, even with the substitutions. i noticed some people thought it was too bland, but that may be due to seasoning. i always season according to my own taste, and just salt and pepper only never gets it for me! i used old bay seasoning, pepper, and a bit of rosemary, and it was great. the sauce should be doubled, but it's definitely an easy keeper, especially for a so-so fish like tilapia!

I admit I am a picky fish-eater...however the mix of flavors in this recipe just didn't work for me.  We didn't finish our meals and I wouldn't make this again.

It was all right but the sauce was too thin

this was not very good at all. the flavors of the marinade simply didn't compliment the fish in my opinion. definately will not try this again.

My husband wasn't real fond of this one. While I did make one substitution (red wine vinegar for raspberry) the overall flavor left us both a bit wanting. I think next time I might through some chopped nuts into the glaze mix since it seems tilapia really picks up nutty flavors well. I would also add more lemo juice (not from concentrate.) Not bad, but don't know if I'll go out of my way to make it again since the flavor was a bit bland.

I found this recipe to be bland.  I followed the suggestions of others and doubled the sauce.  Unfortunately, it still tasted like plain fish.  I will not make this again.

this is a great recipe! the glaze is a little watery, but I think adding a little corn starch would be a great way to thicken it up! I also drizzled a little over my veggies and it was outstanding! thank you for sharing!!

OMG... this recipe tasted great... I tripled the sauce ingredients... Made 7 pieces of tilapia... Should have quadrupled sauce because I only had a tiny bit to drizzle on top...we like our food cooked a little longer so I left it in oven an extra minute or two each side...substituted the vinegar and lemon juice with the Larry's Hawaiian marinade which gave it that tangy kick... Used season all and Italian seasoning... So good!
