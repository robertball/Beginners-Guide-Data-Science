Delicious as written but can be easily adjusted to your taste. I have made this with shwarma spices and other Middle Eastern seasoning mixes to coordinate with the dish it's used with. A staple around here! Fast easy healthful and delicious.

Tasty, but too garlicky for my taste, especially since the tahini contains garlic. More lemon or lime juice would cut the garlic heat, and it could use a little honey to counter a slight bitterness.
