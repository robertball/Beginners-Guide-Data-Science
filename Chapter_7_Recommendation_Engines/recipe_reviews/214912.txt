Instead of powdered non-dairy creamer, I used two tablespoons liquid sugar free french vanilla Coffeemate. I made no other changes. I thought this was good but it really had a little too much milk.

This tasted good, but I wouldn't say spectacular. It kind of tasted like an icy cafe mocha milk. It was on the thin side.
