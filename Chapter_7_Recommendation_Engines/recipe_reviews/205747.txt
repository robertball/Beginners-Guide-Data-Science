mmmwow! These were amazing!! Instead of sugar I used honey, instead of red pepper I used cayenne hot sauce, and instead of all those fillers I get in sausages from grocery stores I got a good homemade yummy sausage! Delish! Thank you!

The sausage were good, however I did double the spice as I could tell it wouldn't be enough. The first time I made it I just had some leftover ground chuck from another recipe so I had to adjust the portions. The next time (still using the leftover ground chuck from another recipe) I doubled all except the meat again and added a little imitation maple flavoring as I sometimes enjoy maple sausage and it was good as well. I definitely recommend this recipe, just double spices.

Based on the reviews, what didn't work wasn't the recipe as much as it was the cook. I believe I made 2 mistakes which I will correct on the next round. Mistake #1 was to buy super lean ground beef. I should go for a higher fat % next time. #2 was not combining all the seasonings in a shaker first so they could be distributed better. I'm going to eat my entire first attempt and then do it again.

Wanted sausage patties and gravy to go over biscuits, but had only hamburger, no pork sausage.  This was an excellent substitution if you don't have any pork sausage!! Thanks for sharing!!

I hate pork & had some extra ground beef so I decided to have breakfast for dinner & made these patties.  I used fresh finely diced red chili peppers & sauteed them with finely diced onion.  I didn't have marjoram so I substituted cumin.  I also substituted honey for sugar.  So delicious & totally better than crappy store patties.  Thanks Papadooka!

I found them extraordinary; the mixture of spices are perfect but i love spices so i doubled all of them except the salt. My family and i aren't big salt eaters but besides that they were amazing. Sweet but at the same time a little spicy. Definitely a keeper! thank you for sharing :)

Easy to make and DELICIOUS! I use a little extra sugar and less red pepper just because I like it sweeter and not as spicy. Great sausage by itself or in a casserole!! Thanks!

Just as good as store-bought regular and much yummier than the low-fat store-bought. It's just as good without the sugar, says my diabetic. I'll be trying it with turkey/beef mix pretty soon.

Very tasty.  Almost as good as my grandfather's beef sausage (whose recipe I don't have).  I made and ate them the same day and they were still delicious.  Can't wait to try again letting them sit overnight.

Quick tip I got from Cooking Light magazine: If you use grass fed beef, like I do, add mayo to your beef.  After reading the reviews, I doubled all the spices except salt and mixed well in a large bowl, then added the beef and about 1/4 cup mayo and mixed well. This is so much better then store bought breakfast sausage and it uses up some of the ground beef I got from the half cow I got from the butcher! Thanks so much for sharing! I will make this again and again!

I made it exactly as it was printed and it was amazing, I'm not a big fan of sage but it works well in this recipe. I used it for sausage gravy and I highly recommend that, it's going to be my new gravy recipe from now on. I probably will play with it depending on my application, making it spicier or sweeter, but the basic recipe is great, thanks for posting it.

These were very good.  Mixed it very well, to change the consistency of the meat, then left it in the fridge for about 3 days.

Nice flavor, great alternative to pork breakfast sausage.  I tried it because I was looking for a high protein breakfast that is low in fat and carbs.  Get tired of eggs every morning.  I used extra lean ground beef to further reduce the fat content.

Easy and very tasty , I left out the sage ( didn't have any on hand) and added a 1/4 teaspoon liquid smoke.  Turned out very good. Thanks for posting this recipe.

I made this with elk, but it was too dry. Next batch was 1/2 elk, 1/2 pork, but it was a little too greasy for my taste, but was exactly like eating sausage from the store! Next batch will be 2:1 elk to pork. The taste is so good, and so easy to make. I made a double batch and formed the sausage into patties, wrapped and froze. They cook up beautifully after being defrosted. Next batch I'm also going to add maple syrup as I think the maple flavor will make these even better! Tip: buy your spices in the grocery store bulk spice section. I got enough sage and marjoram (spices I don't normally use) for multiple batches for $0.12, yes twelve cents.

*Love Love Love *
I would give this a 10 if I could. We do not eat pork and my son has been begging for some beef sausage. Since we will only eat Organic Meat I have to make my own seasoned recipes. 
I found this recipe and made it exactly as written. I am going to ad it to ground turkey as well because I am going to freeze large portions to keep on hand.

Thank you so much!! I have two little boys who love sausage but have developed an intolerance to pork.  This is also great for my husband who needs low sodium meals.

Very good recipe.  I like mine a little spicy so I doubled the amount of red crushed pepper.  To combine the spices, I used an electric spice/coffee grinder before adding them to the meat.

This was a hit with the family, I stuck with the recipe except I used a little cayenne pepper in place of the crushed red pepper.

I usually don't review recipes, but I had to in this case. I'm American and living in Jordan.  After a year and a half I have come to miss sausage and biscuits and gravy. I thought that there had to be a way to make homemade sausage out of ground beef and that's when I came across this recipe. OMG, did this hit the spot! I didn't have onion powder so I chopped some onions very small, dried them out in a low oven and them crumbled. I didn't have any marjoram so I had to sub oregano.  Other reviews mentioned doubling the spices so since I used only one pound of ground beef I left the spices as they were. Had I used two pounds i would have doubled them.  I actually let the sausage sit about 36 hours since I made it at night and felt that cooking it in the morning wouldn't allow the spices to sufficiently flavor the meat, hence letting it sit about 36 hours. I will definitely make this again, and again, and again, without changing a thing. Oh yeah, since I don't like spicy stuff, I omitted the red pepper flakes.

I did not cook it into patties. Instead I just separated it into the amounts I will need sausage for, i.e. sausage gravy, pinto beans, etc. Definitely will be making this again.

I made a few modifications based on folks' reviews and what I had on hand. It's only been sitting for a couple of hours, but I did a taste test, and this is great! I had to use ground sage cause that's all I had, but that worked fine. I doubled the spices as others had suggested and added a half teaspoon or so of fennel seed, cause I always add it to my homemade sausage, and this is just awesome!!! This will be my go-to recipe when I'm out of sausage for biscuits and gravy or lasagna. Thanks!

This was really good! Didnt have marjoram so I omitted it. Used green onion and dried minced onion cuz that's what I had. Didn't have dried sage so used fresh. Added some extra spices. Lol you really can play with this recipe, it tastes just like sausage . Def making again

This is a great recipe I doubled up on the spices and used 73% lean ground beef for the higher fat also I added a 1/4 cup of warm water after mixing meat with spices to give it more of a sausage consistency vs burger patties

Now I know why I could never find the sausage my grandfather used to make. It was with beef and not pork.  

Not enough salt for my wifes' taste, overall great. Will make from now on

I just made this this morning and didn't let them set in the fridge,  even though the meat tasted overly seasoned. I didn't add the sugar or marjoram but I did add 1/4 c. of water.  I found them too salty - not really a good substitute for pork sausage.

Followed recipe exactly. Tastes remarkably like traditional pork sausage. We don't eat pork so this recipe is very much appreciated. I am glad I found it! Thanks!

Delicious. Great. Could use a bit more heat and a little less salt. Will use often.

I made this recipe but was out of the sage. I Thought I had the sage but didn't. So I googled it for a sage substitute and marjoram came up which was already an ingredient in recipe so I just added more and more basil. I took suggestions from the comments and double after seeing this would not be enough but you might want to try with the listed amount then let sit over nite because the flavors were strong but I enjoyed it doubled .I like sage sausage so I know this will be a hit with the sage! I did make another mistake and cooked 2 pieces right after making .......don't waste your meat  it tasted bland my husband said ugh, it defiantly needs to sit over nite . I flash froze mine and had for breakfast the next morning and had to hide them from him...smile. I will be making this again both ways with and without sage...thanks for posting I can eat healthy breakfast sausage now! Yay! Especially since we're on a and gluten free diet & we don't eat pork, eager to try with la by , turkey, venison

note: i didn't let the spices sit for 24 hours, just 2 so maybe that is why it wasn't flavorful enough.  next time, i think i will make sure to get ground beef not chuck (needs the fat) and will double spices.  considering substituting maple syrup for brown sugar as well.  also will make smaller patties. otherwise i was very happy with this recipe.

I'm glad I found this recipe because I was looking for a substitute or something similar in taste to sausage and this, I got to admit surprised me and from now on I will use it in some recipes that requires sausages. Also, like one of the reviewers did, I add bit more red pepper flakes and it was perfect. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!!
