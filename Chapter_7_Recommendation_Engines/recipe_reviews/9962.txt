Neither the recipe itself nor the reviewers comments indicate what's supposed to happen to the chocolate chips.  Since the name of the recipe says "Chocolate Chip" I thought the chips would remain intact.  The first time I made this, the chips all melted.  The second time I decided to try something different and did not add the chips with the cereal.  I took about half of the cereal mixture, patted it into the pan and allowed it to cool for a while.  Then I sprinkled the chocolate chips (actually, more like a cup and a half) over the cereal mixture and topped it with the remaining cereal mixture.  The chips melted a bit, but the chocolate remained in a layer in the middle of the bars.  Either way, these are delicious, and easy to make for a quick treat.  I took them for a snack after a meeting last night and everyone commented on how good they were.  At one point someone asked if I'd noticed that everyone was eating them and ignoring the other snacks. A winner.

I spent most of Sunday night doing my yearly Christmas baking -- always at the last minute -- and had a *huge* box of Rice Krispies I bought awhile back, but no marshmellows to do the traditional rice krispies treats.

I stumbled across this recipe in my determination to find *something* to do with this box of Rice Krispies... and WOW!!!  This is even way easier than the traditional rice krispies treats, and just as yummy!

Too bad I only have one 9x11 pan though.  I wanted to make more!

What an excellent recipe!!  I was actually looking to get rid of some small marshmellows I had, so I added 4 cups marshmellows to the recipe..a bit stickier..but it was so good!!  Thank you for this recipe!!

These are so easy and no sticky pot to scrub.  Kids love them!  I make extra and cut them up and keep them in the fridge.  Easy recipe for kids to make too.  They have become a Girl Scout most asked for recipe in our troop.

Playgroup LOVED these!  I lined my cake pan with wax paper for easy 'lifting' out of the pan.  I also stored them covered overnight, maybe that's why mine were still soft the next day?  I followed the recipe exactly, using both chunky and creamy peanut butter.  I followed another suggestion of spinkling the chocolate chips between two layers of the rice cereal mixture to keep the chocolate from melting.  These were a HUGE HIT!  Thanks!

I have changed my review to 5 stars after a second attempt at these treats. I used natural peanut butter for richer flavour, and milk chocolate chips instead of semisweet. The key to this: use less rice crispies than stated in the recipe! I used only 6 cups and this made the bars fantastic... 8 cups was just too dry. Turns out these are a keeper!

I have made this recipe twice now..everyone loves it.  I made it out of special K cereal and I melted extra choc chips with a bit of milk and sugar and spread it over the bars.

Very yummy.  There was a complaint that these cookies were crumbly.  If you follow the microwave instructions, that will happen.  It's just the nature of microwaves.  However, I brought this to a boil on the stove top and they held together very well.  But you must stir it constantly to prevent scorching.

I've never given a recipe a 3 before, but I'm just not sure what the big deal is about these bars. I followed the recipe exactly and was very disappointed. They were very dry, the bars fell apart when I cut them, and the flavor was not good at all. They were worse the next day, as the rice crispies got stale and crumbly. I'm glad so many people have had success with these bars, but I won't make them again.  :-(

Great recipe, traditionally instead of mixing in the chocolate chips, we have always sprinkled them on the top of the finished treats, placed it in the oven on 350 just long enough to soften & then spread across the top.  For a low glycemic option replace the corn syrup & sugar w/agave nectar.  It might take a little more time to set up (and will be a little softer than the original recipe, but will still hold shape), but the flavor is not at all lost & I feel much better about giving it to the kids!

Delicious bars, and so quick to fix. Light and tasty, the kind of snack you may need before and during your university exams (personnal experience ;)): a real boost of carbs. Even if you don't have to go through this terrible experience, make them just for their taste...

This was ok.  I cooked the mixture too long and instead of bars, I ended up with crumble.  If I were to make it again, I would keep the chocolate seperate by melting it and spreading it on top of the cereal once it has been pressed in the pan.

I substituted cheerios instead of rice crispies and it turned out great. I had been looking for a easy chewy cereal recipe for a quick fix for my sweet tooth.

I have grown up making this a little differentlly. Bring the corn syrup and sugar just to a boil, then add peanut butter. Mix with cereal and press into a pan. Then I melt chocolate chips and butterscotch chips and pour over the top.  They are always a hit and very easy!!!

A little too dry and crumbly.  Prefer them a little gooier.  The taste though with the peanut butter and chocolate is over the top!  Love them, just will use less crispies next time.

Really good, quick snack.  My family has been known to come to blows over the last one.  Just kidding.  We put the chocolate chips on top instead of with the other ingredients.  Then spread the chips around while still warm to make a frosted effect.  Watch your timing while bringing to a boil and don't overdo it or you'll end up with hard crispies.  Underdo it and they turn out too sticky.

Everyone in the family loved these cookies.  The flavor reminds me a little of a Nutty Bar.  Very good.  I have made these at least 20 times since I found this recipe a year or so ago!  Great everytime.  Thanks!

I WAS LOOKING FOR A LITTLE LITER VERSION. THIS IS FAIRLY HEAVY WITH THE AMOUNT OF PEANUT BUTTER.  NOT VERY SWEET. SEEMS TO HAVE TOO MUCH OF A KARO SYRUP TASTE.  I WOULD USE A DIFFERENT RECIPE NEXT TIME WITH MARSHMALLOWS AND LESS PEANUT BUTTER.

Wow!  This is good and so easy.  My four year old made this (with a little help from me, of course) and had so much fun.  I love that you can make these in the microwave and the whole thing is done and cooling in about 10 minutes.  We used mini chips and stirred them in after we stirred in the crispies.  They did melt a little but it didn't take anything away from the final product.  Thanks for sharing such a yummy recipe.  My daughter told her daddy she made them all by herself.  They're that easy!  :)

This is GREAT!  Doubled the recipe, added 1/2 stick (4T) of butter, 2T extra corn syrup, and a generous dash of salt--balanced the flavor.  I substituted reduced-sugar peanut butter for half the recipe, which kept it from being overly sweet. The chocolate chips definitely melted, but it tasted great all swirled together...should be called "Chocolate Peanut Butter Crispies".

Maybe I'm just a stick-in-the-mud, but I personally prefer traditional rice crispies treats.  These did not taste bad at all, in fact, they tasted very good, it's just my own personal preference.  My fiance can't stop eating them, so I will make these again.  Took maybe a total of 5 minutes to make these up, so great treat for the summer.

I had no idea these would be so popular-with kids AND adults.  Anyone who loves rice crispy treats, chocolate and peanut butter will like this easy, no-bake treat.  Thanks Guerin Family!

I loved the easy of this recipe. I have always add m&m's to my rice krispie treats, so I did so here too! So yummy. I think next time I will also add mini marshmallows. 
Thanks for a great recipe

Was looking for a quick dessert to make for my husband and I and found this one. Since I was only making this for 2 people I halved the recipe so that I could use an 8x8 pan. The caramel and chocolate sauce is very easy to make and really good! 4 cups of cereal is too much though as it made it too dry and crumbly. Will make again with only 3 cups of cereal. These will be oowey goowey good. oh and for super easy cleanup, line your pan with foil paper!! Enjoy!! :)

The flavour was quite good, but they were too crumbly. There wasn't really enough of the wet mixture. If I make again, I will use a cup or a cup and a half less of the rice cereal.

One reviewer said these were dry and I agree. I think the peanut better made them dry one cup would have been plenty. I mixed some marshmallow creme into the the hot mixture.  I saved enough to spread on top of the bars well still hot. They did taste good. I would put more chocolate chips and less peanut butter in them next time. I like them on the gooey side too and would use the marshmallow creme again.

i'd give it a 5 but i messed with the recipe..LOL...i added 1 cup of mini marshmallows to help them stick together better. intsead of microwaving the ingredients, i heated the corn syrup, sugar, pb and marshmallows (DO NOT PUT IN CHOC. CHIPS YET)in a saucepan over med-lo until marshmallows were melted then turned up heat to get it boil. i quickly removed from heat once boiling and then poured it into a bowl where the cereal was waiting...stirred it all and pressed into greased 9x13. once cooled, i melted the chocolate chips and poured over and spread it evenly to make a coating. i cut them into squares once chocolate cooled....FABULOUS!

I thought these tasted great, not too sweet at all.  I also put the chocolate chips as others have suggested, in the center.  Only thing I didn't like is these krispie treats seemed kind of hard and almost dry.  I like mine to be softer and more moist.

This recipe turned out TOO sweet for me.  The amount of sugar + corn syrup made it sweet x 10.    I should have seen it coming, though.  The amount of peanut butter mixture to rice crispies was also insufficient.  Perhaps next time more peanut butter.  (I would recommend the chunky salted peanut butter to balance with the sugar).

Very quick and easy! I used other reviewers suggestions and layered the crispy mixture with the chocolate chips between. I took this to my daughters pre-school family day and they all dissappeared! Everyone loved them! They were a little too rich for my taste but I will definatley make this again for a crowd.

Yummy rice crispy treats with a twist.  Even though they don't require an oven, they are still pretty messy to make.  They taste good though.

It tastes amazing. I used maple syrup instead of corn syrup (as that ingredient doesn't sound very healthy) and organic almond butter instead of PB (and next time I'll switch out white sugar for brown/raw). BUT it didn't stick 100% together...

It came out really dry. Next time will use less cereal. To combat the dryness, popped individual squares into the microwave for 15-20 seconds just before eating them.

Great flavor and WAY easier than traditional rice krispy bars.  The kids love them and nicknamed them Reeses Krispy Bars.  It took a bit longer to get the mixture to boil in the microwave.  I found it easier to stir the peanut butter mixture if you microwave it for a minute first, then cook on high for 2 minutes, stir, then a minute or two more.  Delicious!

I only made a half batch & used an 8x8 pan since I only had 4 cups of puffed rice cereal.  Extremely easy, and it doesn't matter if you put in a bit too much peanut butter in these (I think I did, but no matter).  Bf really liked these; he had about 5 in a 20 minute period, so we'll have to say these were a success.  The chocolate chips do  melt, and they are a very chocolate-peanut butter-y version of rice crispy treats.  Thanks for the recipe!

I halved the recipe (ran out of PB) and used Wheat Chex. These were very greasy/chewy, and did not have enough PB taste for me. Maybe too much Karo? My friends all liked them, though.

I love this recipe. I liked that I didnt have to use marshmellows because they are so sticky. My family loves peanut butter so it was really awesome. I didnt mix the chocolate chips in, but instead put them in a layer in the middle like another reviewer suggested. definatly will make it again =]

I was not impressed at with this.  Try the recipe for sctocheroos - it's much better altough the recipes are almost the same thing.  Soft, chewy, not at all dry, and just as easy to make.
