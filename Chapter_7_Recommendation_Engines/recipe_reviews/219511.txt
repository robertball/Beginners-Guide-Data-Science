We used half mild taco sauce, half hot salsa in place of the pace picante sauce. They were delicious but we would have preferred something spicier.

Don't try to rush the recipe--the picante sauce will burn.

Yum. I added one cup of broth in the beginning , and mid way added black beans and corn. I served over rice. Big hit !!!
