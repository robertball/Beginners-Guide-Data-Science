I made this for a faculty pot luck and people loved it .  I was worried because it looked like I put too many carrots in, but the amount in the recipe was perfect.  I used a quisinart to shred the carrots and it was such an easy cake to make.  This will be my go to GF cake for parties!  Great recipe and perfect as is.

Promised hubby I'd make him a carrot cake this week and though I have a great recipe already I wanted to see if I could find a good gluten free one.  Well, I tried it - I cooked it in about an 8" x 11" glass pan so it took a bit longer, I made my cream cheese frosting from my other recipe and wow - it came out GREAT.  I used Cup 4 Cup. Only thing I changed was I added some ch. walnuts to the batter.  When he bit into it -- he said it was "stunning"..  :D  and I have to agree. He must've raved about it 4 times since. He still doesn't even know it's gf, and he always can tell and asks.  He didn't even ask!! And I didn't tell him!   GREAT RECIPE, will make often.

It’s so hard to find gluten free recipes that taste great. This cake is so light and full of flavor! So happy to have found a recipe that taste great and made with ingredients you will most likely have in your cupboard. I rarely get an opportunity to leave a 5 star review but this recipe is worthy!

Unlike many gluten free cakes, this one ended up light and fluffy!  It didn't "fall" while cooling and end up gummy like so many other GF cakes and breads I have made.  I added some raisins, otherwise followed the recipe exactly as written.  I will make this again!

I have several members of my family that eat gluten-free, so, I thought I would give this a try.  I used cup 4 cup gluten free flour  which I think is the best all around all purpose gluten free flour.   The cake wasn't too heavy and was very moist, but, it was a little spongy.   It is a pretty basic carrot cake for those that don't like additions like pineapple, coconut, or nuts.  It is also not a thick cake.  It is about the height you would get if you made a cake in a sheet pan.

This is a fantastic gluten free recipe! The cake turned out fluffy and moist, and the frosting recipe was the perfect accompaniment. I added 1/2 C of raisins and made 2 rounds for a layer cake instead of a sheet cake. I did double the frosting recipe to cover the entire cake and fill the center.

This was the first time I've made a carrot cake. It was delightful! It was moist and tasty. I tweaked the recipe a little. I used brown sugar instead of white sugar. I also added half a cup of coconut. I will be adding rasins to it next time as well. I did not make this recipe for the icing. The icing I chose to make had significantly more cream cheese

This turned out beautifully. Baked in a 9" spring form pan. My gluten free people loved it and my non gluten free people couldn't tell that it anything but a delicious carrot cake. I've been requested to make this again for an upcoming birthday. Thanks so much for such a great recipe!

I have never been a fan of carrot cake. However, my husband's favorite cake! (his man cake at our wedding). So I made this for him. I have celiacs.  OMG!  this cake is amazing!  I now am a carrot cake fan! 
As I was washing my cake dish this morning, hubby was asking...when are you going to make that cake again? 
I did add chopped pecans. 
Delish!

I added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts, 1/2 cup dark raisins, and one small can, well-drained, of pineapple. The cake came out great! Yes, I will make this again.

Great and easy recipe! I use a square, glass baking dish and cook it about 50 minutes. Fun to decorate too!

Great cake! Used Bob's Red Mill 1 to 1  GF flour.    It was light and delicious!  I used two 9in pans and it seemed like it was not  enough but it worked!I will  make again.
