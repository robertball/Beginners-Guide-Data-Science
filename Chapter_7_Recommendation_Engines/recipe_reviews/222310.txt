I needed an easy but special dish for the office Christmas pot luck.  This was perfect and several people asked for the recipe.  Here's how I modified this recipe.  1) I scaled it for 12 people; 2) I used 6 cans of Campbell's Tomato Bisque soup w/ 5 cans of water; 3) I used 3, 6-oz cans of premium white crab meat (Kroger brand); 4) I used white pepper instead of black.
     I did not follow directions.  Instead, I sauteed the green onions and dumped them along with everything else except the cream into my 6 qt. slow cooker the night before.  After stirring, I took out a small amount to heat in the microwave and season to taste.  I added way more Old Bay, cayenne, and white pepper than the recipe called for (Campbell's is too sweet so it needed it!). 
     I took it to work, straight from the fridge, and plugged it in.  About an hour before serving, I added the cream and more white pepper.  It was delicious -- a smash hit -- and ridiculously easy (less than 15 minutes, TOTAL).

This soup is good and if there is an emergency for "crab soup" this works well.  It all depends on what prepared tomato soup you use.  However, I can think of better ways to use expensive crab meat.  Having said that,if offered a bowl, I would for sure eat itand enjoy it.

Easy recipe that tastes great! I used crab legs instead and it was still delicious! Great for an occasion when you want an elegant dish without all the fuss.

It was good but not worth the $8 to make it.  While it was ok, neither my boyfriend or I liked it enough to make it a second time.  It was an attractive dish if you were serving a quick dish to company.

I  had 3 tilapia fillets defrosted so I used those and precooked small shrimp and lobster bites.  The fake lobster.  I like the base and I had a half block of cream cheese so I used that up too.  I give a 5 star for flavor, resourcefulness, and speed to make it.

This was fast and easy.  I used Pacific Foods organic roasted red pepper & tomato soup.  I added a bit of basil & a touch of cinnamon. Delicious!

For using canned tomatoes soup, this exceeded my expectations. We really loved this soup.

Quick, easy, and healthy! I omitted the cream because I was cooking for someone who can't tolerate dairy, and I added a bit more cayenne because we like things spicy. I also doubled the crab because I had a 1 lb can of lump crab meat. Tonight I'm making it again, using 1/2 lb crab and adding 1/2 lb shrimp meat. Very good, and reheats very well. A keeper!
