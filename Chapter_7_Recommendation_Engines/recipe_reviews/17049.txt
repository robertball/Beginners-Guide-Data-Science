I make this recipe all the time, boyfriend loves it.  The only thing I do differently is instead of refried beans, I add 1/2 to 1 lb of hot sausage with the ground beef to add some more heat and flavor, and makes it a little meatier.  He always loved it with the refried beans but raves about it now with the sausage! Thanks Amber for the great recipe!--also wanted to add that I use part sour cream and part cream cheese to make that middle layer a little creamier!

This was good. I changed it up a little to suit our tastes. I used taco seasoning packet and tomato sauce instead of water for the taco meat, and I added chopped red pepper on top.

Overall, this turned out great! I also added 1 taco seasoning packet to the ground beef mixture, and I used about 2 1/2 cups of cheese total. I used a mix of  shredded "taco cheese" (a blend of cheddar, Monterey Jack, Colby cheeses and spices) and shredded cheddar cheese. I used about 2 cups of cheese before baking and then added the rest about 5 minutes before removing the dish from the oven. This dish took me about an hour to prepare the first time and about 10 minutes to cool, so I would budget time accordingly. Thanks so much for thus great recipe!

This was very good.  A few guests said it was too spicy for them and I used mild taco sauce.  Another guest won't eat anything with sour cream in it.  I will make this again but only do half with the jalapeno rings.

This was outstanding, the whole thing was gone when served at a Longaberger party.  I used fat free refried beans and sour cream to make it a bit healthier.  I also used part-skim cheese and it turned out great.  I will make this again for the next party I attend.

This dip had very good flavor.  I made this the night before and used canned tomatoes and only the medium taco sauce.  I also only put jalapenos on half to not make it too spicy.  Everyone at work thought that is tasted good, but it didn't look very appetizing.  When cooked, it became very watery, almost like a soup.  I believe that was from the combination of the canned tomatoes and the sour cream.  Next time I will serve the sour cream separate.  I also think that it could definitely use more of the tomatoes and black olives.  For a dip this size 9x13, the amounts recommended did not come close to covering it all.

This was a hit! My mom used to make a similar version. I took out the sour cream and out it on the side for people to add to their plates. I don't like sour cream but I did take a bite and the coolness and cold of the sour cream was a good mix with the spicy of the jalapeno. I will make this again.

I get so many compliments on this dish. I took it last year to a New Year's party and they want it back again. It's not your normal nacho/taco dip. Even the kids couldn't stop eating it spicy or not!

This was very good. Used a rotisserie shredded chicken instead of the beef. I also used taco seasoning and left out the jalapenos because I didn't have any. It was a crowd pleaser. Will definitely make again.

Great recipe!  Was a hit at a party we went to.  I prefer "black" refried beans so I used them which may have given the dish a different flavor?  I threw on a couple extra tomatoes, onions, olives & jalepeno slices too!  Will definately make again.

Took the suggestion from other reviewer and added 1 Tbls of taco seasoning to ground beef, and used Velveeta peperjack. Turned out wonderful! I have a electric fry pan w/a glass lid that you can flip around and use to keep food warm. Perfect size for this dip!!

It was alright---nothing spectacular.  I think it needs more flavor--maybe adding some taco seasoning to the meat when you cook it?  I'm not sure,but to me it seemed bland and all I tasted was the refried beans.  I would also recommend using the shredded Velveta cheese instead of he cheddar because it just doesn't melt right.  I don't think I'd make it again.

This is a great recipe. I have used it several times and its always a hit. I use ground turkey instead of beef for a leaner substitution. I also just use medium salsa, for a quicker replacement for the chopped onion and tomatoes.

I’m about to throw this in the oven but I tried it to see if it’s any good before I did and yum! I took a picture to show that I tweaked it for my son with severe food allergies. I used non dairy substitutes (daiya “cheese”) and his is really good too.

Made this for a family BBQ yesterday and everyone loved it.  I had an old recipe I was trying to replicate and this is the closest I've found to it.  Will definitely make again and again.  I used left over carnitas instead of hamburger and it was a delicious change.  Will use either in the future.  I used a bit more cheese and sour cream than suggested; personal preference.  I left out chopped tomato and jalapeño due to guest preferences, but will add in future for just our family.  Really great recipe; thank you!  Goes great with homemade pico!
