Very, very good.  I reduced the brown sugar to ¼ C in both cases and added a generous shot of Maker's Mark. (put some in the sweet potatoes too.)  Assumed egg whites were to be beaten to stiff peaks and folded in.

Since I made this for Easter, I substituted 2% milk for the eggnog.  It has a wonderful flavor and the topping makes a nice crust to go along with the sweet potato.  I did place it under the broiler for a few minutes to get the top a little crisper.  I will definitely make again!

Really good, and a bit different than the other versions. I added a bit of cinnamon to the topping, used milk instead of eggnog and browned the sugar under the broiler at the end. Really great side dish and I will definitely make again, maybe splenda next time.

I loved this recipe. You can really taste the eggnog in it. I used 3cups drained canned sweet potatoes and it worked fine.

Delicious! To make the whole thing a little healthier I used skim milk instead of eggnog and egg substitute instead of egg whites. I also turned the broiler on at the very end of the baking time so that the topping browned. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it was wonderful. I will definitely be making this again.

Very easy recipe to make.  I used used half vanilla extract and half orange extract and it was great. My family loved it- even my 3 year old who tasted it "by accident".  I will definately make this again, but maybe more as a dessert instead of a side because it was very sweet.

I meant to review this after I made them for Thanksgiving.  EXCELLENT!  I made exactly as stated (except the topping, I added a handful of finely chopped pecans) and even people who said the don't like sweet potatoes, gobbled these up.  It has to be the eggnog.  Or the sweet nutty topping.  These were so very good, thank you for sharing!

This recipe is sooo easy and tastes great.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly and found it too sweet.  The second time I did not put the brown sugar in the potatoes only on top and it tasted so much better.

Excellent, easy and fast - I added the marshmellows and pecans on the top and surrounded with the pecan crumb mixture.  Satifying all of the groups request for types of sweet potatoes.  Some are used to mellows and others nuts. 1st time that I made anything sweet potatoe - I was requested to make them again for Christmas.  I even ate them and I don't even like sweet potatoes.

Very good.  I had some Land o Lakes Cinnamon Butter and I used that.  It was a little too spicy so I might cut down a bit next time.  I also halved the sugar.

This is EXCELLENT... much healthier and a better consistency than the one I usually make.  Also, I like that the topping DOESN'T have nuts... great for people with allergies.  Thanks so much!

Exactly what I wanted it to be: rich, decadent, and NOT TOO SWEET!  I did the milk/eggnog substitution and have no regrets.  A real hit at the holiday table!!!

This was the first allrecipes recipe I tried and I could not be happier.  This dish was a complete hit and will be a Thanksgiving staple for me from now on.  It's not too sweet and the eggnog totally sets this dish off. Try this recipe, you won't be sorry!!

This was pretty good. I used sweet potatoes & yams, very interesting! I Did miss the pineapple in my usual sweet potato casserole. I think I just added the marshmallows out of habit. A bit of ground nutmeg went in as well. I made the eggnog for it too!. Thank You Kelley, Yummy! Merry Christmas!!

Delicious!  I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and gor rave reviews.  Everyone wanted to know how I gave it such a unique flavor.  What a brilliant idea to add eggnog.  Thanks!
