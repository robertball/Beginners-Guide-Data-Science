This wasn't a big hit at our house tonight, as evidenced by the fact that Hubs left his on his plate (he'd probably rate this 1-star). I didn't bother to ask him why he didn't care for it because I knew the answer after eating it myself.  In a nutshell, it was just too rich - too much mayo, too much cheese.  And without the additions I made of fresh minced garlic and Penzey's Fox Point Seasoning, I suspect this would have been a little wimpy flavor-wise too.  Something this rich might be good as a dip (think Artichoke-Spinach Dip) but it's just too rich as a side dish.

My husband and I really enjoyed this.  Preparation was quick and easy.  I used a jar of roasted red bell peppers on top instead of the sliced tomatoes.

Quite good.  I cut down the calories a bit by using light sour cream, only about 2 tbs of light mayo, and cooked the green onions in ~1 tsp of olive oil instead of butter.

I thought this recipe was kind of bland.  I added some garlic, pepper, and potatoes, and used chopped onions that I cooked with the mushrooms instead of green onions (I had none).  I scaled it down on the site to 2 servings and followed the recipe from there; as I said, I just thought it was kind of bland.  There is a possibility that because I added the potatoes that I should have made more sauce, but all of the veggies were covered before I baked it and so I figured it was enough.  I wouldn't make this again unless I needed to use up some veggies in the fridge.

Recipe was ok. I did make a couple of changes based on other reviews. I only used 2 tbsp. of light Mayo and replaced the sour cream with cottage cheese. I added garlic and salt and pepper and it still came out a little bland. Maybe because I cutting down on the mayo- it didn't seem like enough sauce for the veggies. I did like the tomatoes on the top though- it was a good lively contrast with the other veggies.

My family loved this!  As I decided to make this at the last minute, I had to make some substitutions.  Instead of broccoli, I used a frozen bag of broccoli, cauliflower & carrots.  We don't have canned artichoke hearts here in Greece where I live, so I used frozen artichoke bottoms, which I cooked in the boiling water before adding the broccoli mix.  Otherwise I followed the recipe as stated, adding seasoning to taste at the table.  A great meatless main dish, or a fine side dish!

This was delicious!  I added 3 potatoes (quartered), 2 cloves of garlic, and a quarter cup of white wine.  Nice winter supper!  Susan in Santa Fe

I did not use the tomatoes because I didn't think they matched. The next time I would not use fat free mayonnaise and I don't see what the mushrooms added to the dish. Just artichokes and broccoli I am going to try next time.

2 heads broccoli is kind of vague - my broccoli heads were pretty small, and someone had said it was too rich, so I decided to use a little extra of everything else to balance out the sour cream and mayo. I used 2 (small) heads of broccoli and half a head of cauliflower. I didn't measure the mushrooms, probably about 2-3 cups, and about 5-6 green onions. I also added a chopped up clove of garlic. Someone had said it was bland, so I gave a few shakes of lemon pepper and of basil. This time of year the only halfway decent tomatoes that don't cost the earth are romas - it took three of those to spread approximately 1/4 inch slices over that large a pan. Didn't measure the breadcrumbs either, probably used a little more. The package of cheese was 1-1/2 cup and I used it all. I did use the 14 oz. can of artichokes, as directed. So the vegetables didn't end up mushy (which someone objected to), I made sure they were just beginning to get tender in the water. After 25 minutes, didn't look done enough so I left it in for 10 more. We were going to relatives, so when I got there, to heat it up, I stuck it under the broiler until the bread crumbs (which hadn't really browned) looked nicely toasted. I guess I just consider recipes a starting point - some suggestions. That said, it was GREAT!! The broccoli and cauliflower were perfectly done. Every once in awhile you'd get a nice flavor of the artichoke. Everyone loved it and I'm adding it to my repertoire with the changes I made.

I don't know what some of these people are talking about.  I followed the recipe as written.  We all loved it. The only reason people may have found it bland is if they left our the artichokes.  That artichoke gave it a great tang.  This is now a family favorite!!

This was a great accompaniment to grilled pork chops. I cut the mayonnaise and sour cream to fit my taste and used portobello but any mushroom would work.

This was really good and quite easy.  We used smal portabella mushrroms which work better thatn the white button mushrooms
