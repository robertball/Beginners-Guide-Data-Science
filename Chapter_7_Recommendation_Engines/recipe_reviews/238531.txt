Very nice potato salad that went well with grilled bacon wrapped turkey tenderloins. I mixed it up in the morning and we enjoyed it that same evening. It had a nice creamy texture but we didn't get a lemony flavoring. With potato salad season quickly approaching I know I will be making this one again. Thanks Bren for sharing your recipe we enjoyed it.

Loved it! The name is a bit misleading as there is nothing 'lemony' about this IMO. We really enjoyed the sweetness from the slaw dressing and miracle whip. This was a great change from the usual and one I will be making again! Thanks for sharing.:)

Great way to peel potatoes by boiling first!
I had to skip the chives because someone supposedly had an onion allergy.  I added Italian seasoning (basil, rosemary, oregano, dill) and crystallized lemon (Tru Lemon brand).  I also used a lot more Miracle Whip because I think I used 6 extra large potatoes.  It made a lot!
