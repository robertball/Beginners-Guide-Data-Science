Shirley, my hat is off to you.  I'm originally from New Jersey & your recipe is exactly the way the best oriental resturants offer them, I've been looking for a recipe for Shrimp Toast and now I've found it, and I'm sharing with my whole family. Thank YOU!

The shrimp toast was okay.  The texture was really good.  It was a bit strong on the onion side. The next time I would cut down on the onion and add more shrimp.

I was really excited to try this recipe.  I had never heard of anything like it.  I enjoyed it, but thought the shrimp mixture needed some kind of kick.  I think I may put some hoisin or red pepper sauce in the mix next time.  I will make again, really fun presentation.

These fry up quickly, so keep your eye on them.  I used panko bread crumbs, and you get plenty of that sweet, fresh shrimp flavor with every bite.  Here's a tip for you that will save you lots of time.  Trim the crusts, spread the shrimp mixture on both sides, coat with the breading, and THEN cut into triangles.  My hubby said he thinks these really need  dipping sauce, so we tried traditional cocktail sauce and peanut sauce.  We liked both, but  I'll play around with some other sauces to find the best.  I don't fry often, but these were worth the splurge, and we thoroughly enjoyed them.
