I made this last night for guests and everyone raved!  Not being a beer drinker, I used low sodium chicken broth instead and used the entire can of black beans.  I served this with orzo, a green salad and, as suggested, a nice red wine.  Thanks, Alex.  This is definitely a keeper!

So easy my husband didn't even screw it up!  A taste we weren't expecting but enjoyed on the first bite and more by the last.  The first time this was made we used a generic Japanese brand salsa that has no bite (live in Japan).  The second time, we used an American salsa that gave the dish more of a sweet sour taste.  Depending on your tastes, simple to fiddle with the salsa to tweak the flavour.

Followed the recipe exactly as stated.  Its consistency is like that of a very hearty stew. It was W-O-N-D-E-R-F-U-L!!! Thanks so much for sharing this delicious recipe.

My husband was more enthusiastic about this than anything I've made in a long time.  I was determined to make the cornmeal work, and I believe the solution is to make sure your oil is very hot when you first add the coated meat, and not to turn it until there is a good, golden color to the down side.  Continue to turn and brown the meat until all sides are browned.  This gives a crisp coating that won't fall off and get mushy, as some reviewers have complained about.  I used medium salsa, but think it would be better with hot.  I also added the whole can of beans and don't think it was too much.  (And besides, what was I going to do with half a can of black beans?)  Initially I added a little more beer, bean liquid, and peach syrup, but as it continued to cook and thicken, I just periodically added a little water.  The pork was wonderfully tender, and the combination of flavors was unusual and good.

Tried this recipe. Though the idea was great I think it could do without the cornmeal. It made the sauce very mushy and grainy and sloppy looking. If I made this again I would do without the cornmeal and just quickly brown the pork and let it simmer in the sauce. Also the peaches gave it a nice flavor but I'm not big on pork/peaches. Might forgo the peaches too. The beans, salsa, and beer were an excellent idea though.

We've made this many times and love it.  We skip the cornmeal, use a medium level salsa and season the pork with jerk or creole seasoning before cooking to add a little flavor.  It's a great dinner for a change of pace.

I had some boneless pork chops in the freezer I needed to use up, so I used them in the recipe.  I also used 1/4 cup of Corona beer, and added a couple of splashes of lime juice.  Also, I didn't want half a can of black beans sitting in my fridge until the next century, so I just threw in the whole can of drained beans.  This recipe came out delicious, it was a nice mix of interesting flavors.

Since I didn't have pork tenderloin on hand I used pork chops instead and it turned out great.  I didn't have beer either so used water as someone else had suggested. I prepared it in a big frying pan with a tight fitting lid to ensure the chops stayed moist and tender. My family loved it and my husband asked me to make it again

I feel that the cornmeal greatly declined the quality of this recipe. I read other reviews and took the time to make sure the cornmeal created a nice crispy crust, but once the other ingredients were added, the cornmeal crust began to breakdown. The sauce became grainy. I didn't like the texture one bit, but the taste was pretty good. Will try this one again without the cornmeal.

This is SO good. I was skeptical but the flavors blend so delicately, the sauce is fabulous.  I used mild salsa but you could go with medium if you wanted to give a little more kick, or hot if you live in the southwest. The sweetness from the peaches balances out the heat. Chicken broth substitutes well for the beer, raise it to a 1/2 cup if you want a thinner sauce (my preference).  I also mixed fresh mint half and half with the cilantro. This dish is simple and fast, took me just under 40 minutes start to finish.  Goes great with grilled corn and makes a super dish for the RV.

Very flavorful.  I added all the beans (what can you do with a half-can of leftover black beans?), and substituted water for the beer.  Tastes great reheated, also.

Why would anyone rate a dish that they didn't make and give it 3 stars because it included an ingredient they don't like. I'll go with 5 stars because it sounds delicious and it will balance out the other reviewer's low rating!

I used just one fresh peach and that was fine.  It turned out pretty spicy and I used La Vitoria medium salsa.  Hubby tasted it, not knowing it had peaches in it and said, "this would be really good with pineapple in it".  Whatever that means to you..  I think I ought to have made rice to serve it over.

After reading many reviews, here's my take: This recipe produces a sweet and savory taste unexpected for chunks of pork. The cut of meat doesn't really matter as long as you cook the pork thoroughly (no pink!): chops, cubed roast or tenderloin. I used the cornmeal and followed other cooks' recommendations to get the oil HOT, turn meat once seared/browned on each surface/side (you need to be "hands on" for about 15 min.). Once nicely browned, add peaches, black beans, salsa....salt and ground pepper to taste. Then put a lid on your skillet and let it simmer (doesn't dry out). Served this with the Maple Glazed Sweet Potato w/bacon and carmelized onions from this site....a lovely pairing of tastes!

I also used chicken stock instead of beer and added canned corn to the bean mix.  I did not coat the pork in cornmeal and it tasted fine. It turned out great.  I think that I would serve this with tortilla chips, sour cream and possibly cheese on top.  A queso fresco could work well.

I made this with chicken instead of pork.  Like the other reviewers, I added garlic and onion powder to the mean, left out the cornmeal, and added the whole can of black beans.  I also added the juice from half a lime at the end and used fresh peaches rather than canned.  Served over brown rice.  Nice flavors!!

Since I’m a huge fan of cilantro, I enjoy this recipe. It’s a quick and simple dish that makes a casual week day meal.  I use “hot” salsa to give it a “kick” and triple the cilantro. Jan. 2013 update: There is no way to brown a pound of pork using just 1 Tbl. of olive oil, so ignore this amount and add as much olive oil to your skillet as you need to brown the pork. I also use the whole can of back beans and not the 1/2 can the recipe calls for. The recipe comes out just fine and I'm not stuck trying to figure out what to do with the 1/2 can of leftover beans.

After reading the reviews, I decided to skip the cornmeal as some of the other reviewers said and I added hot salsa since we like spicy food. I added Newcastle since I like the flavor of a darker beer in recipes. I served it over rice which soaked up the flavors of the sauce. My only regret is that I didn't have any cilantro to add to the dish. This was a wonderful meal and I can't wait to try it again with cilantro.

This is a pretty good recipe as it stands but I substituted pineapple chunks for the peaches. I find that the pineapple does not get mushy like the peaches do and the the pineapple flavor goes beter with the pork then the peaches do.

Hot oil is key and browning on all sides of diced pork to get the cornmeal to stick and not go into the sauce.  I doubled the salsa, beer, and "reserve liquid" b/c we like things saucy and made rice to put it on top of.

It was okay, but I don't understand what all the fuss is about. It wasn't as amazing as I'd expected from all these reviews. I suspect I might have used a too-spicy salsa, since it overpowered the other flavours a bit, but the other flavours themselves still weren't that great.

This is a great recipe. I try to stay away from can goods if I can. I have the time to make most items. I used my own salsa, cooked up some black beans and stole some peaches from my friends that I invited to dinner. The more that I read on food labels and nitrition convinces me that is where a lot of our health problems are. Enought said, Great Recipe.

It was edible, but I will not make this again. All the coating came off the meat and made the sauce grainy. If I would ever retry this recipe I would make the meat and the sauce separably.

We made this dish for the first time the other night and were feeling pretty pleased about having the forsight to make a double batch.  We figured it would be a quick and yummy leftovers dinner, too.  However, our son ended up getting ahold of it and didn't leave enough for the rest of us.  It was great!

This was good....I used mild salsa, but next time I'll use hot.....I did have to add quite a bit of hot sauce to "zip" it up! Very easy and quick...thanks!

This is kind of a staple mid week meal for us, really easy to make and really tasty. I have made several variations. For me the corn meal gives the sauce a little stew like quality so I think it is a necessary ingredrient. I like to add just a little bit of cumin to give it that latin taste and last night I made it with hominy (because I like it in Pozole) pretty good. Although this dish is perfect the way it is written.

I am a very inexperienced cook, but I wanted to try something different so I gave this a shot. I did everything according to the recipe except I used an entire can of black beans and extra cilantro. It also took a lot longer for my pork to cook properly, but I chalk that up to my inexperience. So I had to add a lot more olive oil to keep it from burning. I had no problems with the corn meal. I made sure the pan was hot enough so that it was crispy and didn't get mushy. Soooo good. I wish I had used a hotter salsa, it would have made for an interesting flavor. I served it with wild rice and it was AMAZING. I also used Bud Light Lime. I can't believe it turned out so well. I will definitely be making this again.

Finally something new to our family that was liked.  It's impossible to wreck pork tenderloin so that's a given, but the rest of the recipe was great.  I cooked it longer only because my other food wasn't ready and forgot to plan for rice.  It worked out because more of the liquid was cooked off in the extra time.  This is my husband's kind of food-black bean salsa,etc (that's why I chose the recipe) but everyone else liked it too.  keeper

This sounds very except I am one of the minority who does not care for Black Beans.  I guess I will try Pintos or Chile beans.  Someone also suggested using chicken as a variation.  We'll see!

This was a good recipe and I would make it again, however I felt it lacked spice (which I guess could be a result of the chosen salsa). I will try it with some fresh jalapenos or other spicy peppers next time. I did omit the corn meal, used leftover "Grecian Pork Tenderloin" and switched out the beer with chicken broth (I forgot we had drank it all. Whoops!). Very good served over brown rice.

My new favorite recipe. I've made this twice and it turned out great both times. It's very forgiving of variations. I more than doubled it because the pork loin package was really big. I put extra black beans and peaches the second time. The sauce is really tasty and has a nice consistency. It works with flour in place of the cornmeal if necessary.

I made this for the first time last night. It is fabulous. My husband and son raved about it. Since I am a working Mom, I sliced the pork, coated it with cornmeal seasoned with fresh ground pepper, and browned it the night before. The next night I completed cooking the dish within 20 minutes.

This was delicious!  It moved me to write my first review.  It was very easy to make, too!  I didn't use the corn meal because we didn't have any at home and other reviews said they liked it better that way anyway.  The flavors were a great combination, including the peaches.  I'm sure fresh peaches would be great too, but canned peaches might be softer!  I used the whole can of black beans instead of half, and next time, I think I'll ad more meat.  I think chicken would be great for this recipe too.

Very tasty - loved the salsa! - best part of the recipe. Will do again! Tried it again a yr + 1/2 later and found it to be good but not great. Did not put coriander this time as girlfriend doesn't like it - could that have been the difference??

We omit the cornmeal, use 2 cans of black beans (draining 1 can and adding the other with the liquid), and use diced peaches. We also use HOT salsa--so there is nothing bland about it. My Husband's FAVORITE meal.

this recipe is delicious & forgiving! I had bought fully cooked Pork without noticing, and then I forgot about it cooking and started to burn the bottom, and some other mistakes I can't remember now..but somehow it still turned out delish! I loved the peaches :) & it was totally unique!

The pork was unbelievably tender.  I used a Boneless Sirloin Roast.  I don't know if browning it with the corn meal was the secret.  The cornmeal stuck to the cubed pork so well. I did have to use 3-4 tablespoons of olive oil vs the recipe's 1 Tablespoon.  This meal was as pretty as it was tasty, and it was equally as good the next night for leftovers.  I have made this several times.  We really enjoy it.

This was a good dish. Something a little different than what I am used to. But I did enjoy it. The flavor from the peach was what I enjoyed most. Not a dish I would ask for on a regular basis, but would enjoy once a month.

This was good for something different, but I wasn't thrilled with the texture of the cornmeal.  I also wish I hadn't drained the peaches.  I think it could have used a little extra sauce.  I might try it again, minus the cornmeal, adding a little of the peach juice, and possibly a little spice... Maybe red pepper or cayenne?

This has to be one of the best dishes I have ever made!  However, I did not follow the recipe exactly... per reading some of the other reviews & because I can't follow directions... I did the following:  Seared meat without breading, used pork chops & cut off all the fat.  Used fresh peaches, an entire can of spicey black beans & its sauce. Added a small call of fiesta corn, and 3 large peppers from my garden to add color, heat, & sweetness.  Used white wine vinegar instad of salt for a little tang and a can of strained diced tomatoes with green chillies instead of salsa.  Also a little minced garlic. Didn't use any beer as I drank it all. Awesome meal!  Boyfriend also suggested it would be good over Nachos or a dip.   Will also try with chicken and use left overs as a burrito and add sour cream.  Did end up using pork fat in some fried potatoes and onions... so much for the healthy factor... but oh so tastey!

Super good!  I served this for dinner to guest and they raved.  I omitted the corn meal and added a bit of chili powder with the salt and pepper.  I used one peach and added some mango salsa with the regular salsa.  I served it over brown rice, and added the Italian Spinach Salad from this site.  YUMMY!

I was careful not to add any excess cornmeal, just what adhered to the meat...so I didn't have a problem with the cornmeal turning the liquid soupy.  This was a good dish for something different :)

I give this four stars because it needs to be kicked up a notch.  I put some cumin, paprika, garlic and onion powder in the corn meal to give it some spice.  It turned out ok.  I think it probably needs some chile of some kind to make it truly great.  I think serving with warm tortillas is a good idea with salsa and guacamole.  All in all it turned out good and the leftovers are going to be eaten.

I used a peach salsa instead of peaches and tomato salsa and it was great!  A real "make again".  Thanks!

We really liked this one.  It was an odd....but good combination of tastes.  My boyfried raved about it. I didn't change anything in the recipe but next time I might add more peaches : )

Unfortunately, this was not a hit in our house.  The cilantro gave it some good flavor, but the cornmeal made it into a mush, and no one was crazy about it.  I'll probably have to throw out the leftovers.

I'm not sure what the people who claim this has no flavor did wrong because it was excellent just as stated! I made it for dinner with a friend of mine and we both enjoyed it immensely - she stole some leftovers to take home too. It was also really easy to make - I was able to drink a glass of wine and chat with my friend, and it still turned out wonderful! Definite keeper, will make for my husband next, thanks Alex!

Yummy.  I used almost the entire can of black beans and used medium salsa.  I was liberal with the cilantro.  I served it over some basmati rice.  My husband and I both loved it.  Super easy and quick.  This will be something I definitely make again.  Thanks!

I just made this last night for the first time, and then my husband invited guests to dinner last-minute, but thankfully they loved it as did we (including two 9-year-old boys). I will make this again, it is so easy and so delicious.

I'm so bummed; this was a big old "miss" for us.  I should have listened to my gut but this recipe had so many positive reviews. My husband and I were completely UNDERwhelmed. We usually love stuff like this.  Too bland.  When we added a bit of lime, cumin and salt, it was a bit better but still failed to rock our world.  I served it over rice.  I won't make it again but I do want to say that the cornmeal adhered to the cubed pork nicely since I followed suggestions to panfry it in hot oil.  Oh, I bet onion would be a nice addition to add more flavor.  Best wishes to all.

I made this as directed except I didn’t use the cornmeal. I used fresh nectarines vs. canned peaches and added them just before serving so they stayed firm. Spooned over rice pilaf and topped with shredded sharp cheddar. It was very good.

I live about 15 miles from a grocery store, so I am always looking for new recipes with ingredients that I have on hand.  I searched for "peaches + pork" and this recipe popped up.  I had everything on the list and didn't have to substitute.  I did use an entire can of black beans and a store-bought so-so jar of mild salsa.  I used whole pork chops instead of tenderloin, browned in a fry pan, added the rest of the ingredients (I used a brown ale because that is what I was drinking at the time :) ) and finished by covering the pan and putting in a 350 deg. oven for about 30 min or so.  Served with brown rice and asparagus.  Will definitely make again.

So good!!!! Made it last night and making it again tonight! This time I'm going to try and add some onion and a little chili powder or hot sauce to add a kick to it. Not sure how some people had problems with the cornmeal, just make sure the oil is hot. Definitely recommend this!!!

ok so I HAD to make some changes because the peaches I intended to use went bad, they were on sale, but they were awful, so I had to throw them out. All I had was canned pineapple. So I substituted the peaches for pineapple (which still turned out amazing), substituted the beer for chicken broth and left out the cornmeal and substituted that with Jerk Marinade as some other people suggested on here.  Turned out great!  I kind of panicked with the peaches and was just glad I had a substitute on hand. Very flavorful and delicious!

Delicious! This turned out very well. I was looking for a recipe to use some peaches I canned which didn't seal and this sounded interesting. It was simple to make. I followed the suggestion of one reviewer who said to be sure to get the oil really hot before putting the coated pork cubes in and they turned out nicely. My family enjoyed it using medium salsa and a whole can of black beans. Next time I'll serve it on a bed of brown or white rice. If you like fruit salsa, like mango or peach, I think you'll enjoy this recipe plus it uses foods you may already have on hand!

Very simple and tasty.  I noticed that it was much better the second day, and I also noticed that the taste was much better with the pork mixed in (rather than separate).  The mixture alone was a little discordant, but the mixture with the pork was great!

Adults liked it, mixed reviews from the kids.  I'm afraid no one liked the texture/flavor of the peach slices.  Meat nice and tender--had no problem with the cornmeal--made sure the pan was very hot before browning them as others suggested.  Used a medium salsa and a whole can of beans.   Will try again and add some garlic, a small can of corn and crush the peach slices.

This is one of the best pork dishes ever.  The cornmeal coating on the meat provides a thicker, rich sauce.  We enjoyed it served with couscous.  And it tastes just as good the second time reheated.

We didn't care much for this recipe; the consistency was a little strange, and the peaches didn't taste right with the other ingredients.  We would not make this again.

I had a hard time with this one, but I was optimistic and thought I would give it a try.  My daughter loved it.  I thought it was okay, and my husband didn't say much.  I made it as the recipe called for, but if I make it again I will have to tweek.  The first time I ate it, it was good, but I had some leftovers the next day and had a hard time stomaching it.  I think it was the look, and the fact that the beans went to mush.  I may just eliminate the beans all together next time.  we'll see.  Thank you for sharing!

This recipe is so easy and so delicious. I am a big fan of cooking with alcohol and fruits and this is what attracted me to this recipe. I used coarse cornmeal and gave an interesting texture. This one is  keeper for sure!

Wonderful recipe, and so easy.  Used chicken tenderloins since we don't eat pork.  Listened to the other reviewers and used a hot salsa.  Herdez Medium, which is actually pretty hot, gave lots of flavor and just enough kick.  Used chicken broth in place of the beer, omitted the cornmeal, used the whole can of black beans, and added lots more cilantro.  My boys loved it (ages 19 and 11).  Will definitely make again and again. Great with rice. Try it!

I made this with pineapple instead of peaches (didn't have any on hand) and it was great!  Also used chicken broth instead of beer, used the whole can of black beans and left out the cornmeal.  I don't like cilantro so I left that out too.  Served over whole grain rice.  The whole family loved this recipe - will definitely make this again!

I was really surprised at how good this was, considering how "quick & easy" it was to make.  I was hesitant about the addition of beer- I couldn't see how that would fit, but it all blended together into a delicious meal!

My husband made this for me last night - he used fresh peaches and fresh salsa (instead of canned).  We ate everything in the skillet - it was really delicious!  Saving this one for another time too.

I liked the idea of this recipe, but while the flavor was acceptable, it was not an absolute knockout. The use of tenderloin in this recipe is a good choice, as it is always tender and good, but I could think of better uses for it. I cannot understand why the cornmeal is needed, and I would not use it again. It simply ended up making the sauce grainy.

Pretty good, but this is just crying out for rice.  Next time will try adding chicken broth/water and rice for the final 20 or so minutes that it's simmering.

Very good!  I did add a bit more salsa and beans to this as it was a little too dry to reheat (husband gets off of work at 10pm).   Added home made chicken stock instead of beer also, just was not into beer last night.. overall a WONDERFUL dish not to mention quick and very very easy!

My husband and I both thought this was fantastic.  We served it over white rice.  Great flavor.  Very filling.  I doubled the recipe to freeze half for an easy dinner some other night.  I also added the full can of black beans (so 2 cans total since I doubled it).

I cut up the pork tenderloin and placed the pieces on a flat tray. Following other suggestions, I sprinkled garlic powder, and paprika, along with the salt & pepper. Then, using a large flat pancake turner, I scooped the meat and placed it on the bag containing the cornmeal, which I had spread all over the gallon-sized bag, ensuring all meat was covered. The people who had bad experiences with the cornmeal, I think it was because they undercook their meat. The other changes I made was to smash the peaches as much as possible, due to picky eaters at home, and used a jar of taco sauce - medium flavor instead of salsa. I also simmered a bit longer - for about 40 minutes, which made it much thicker. All and all it was a very good recipe and we will be cooking it again.

I thought that it was a little bland when I was finished cooking so I added the remainder of the salsa at the table and it really improved the flavor.  My whole family liked it with additional sauce.

I give this recipe a two only because of the cornmeal.  I will make this again without the cornmeal and will experiment with chicken and mangoes instead of pork and peaches.  The cornmeal in the recipe just makes a really weird texture and it does not look that appetizing.  Drop the cornmeal and I would give it a five.

I did not use the cornmeal based of previous reviews but i did add mix about 1/4 cup cornbread mix with some of the liquid so the sauce would thicken up.
My crew gave this a thumbs up, but we think it will make a big difference if we are sure to use our favorite salsa and a beer we are familiar with. Since I was doubling the recipe, I bought Reser's Baja Cafe refrigerated salsa instead of Emerald Valley's salsa and we had picked up some Sierra Nevada Celebration ale and were not happy with it and since we hardly ever drink, we had nothing else =(

I actually think I would have liked this more if I had made it with chicken instead of pork, and mango instead of peaches. I used chicken stock instead of beer and used the whole can of black beans as others had mentioned before. I served with white rice and a side salad and was overall pleased with this recipe. I will definitely modify for the next time though.

I seem to be in the minority with my opinion of this recipe. My guest and I found it to be very bland and boring... we kept asking each other what more could be added to coax some flavor out of it. Definitely won't be making this again.

We really loved this dish.  I used the full can of beans and added 1/4 cup of extra beer to compensate.  We used Chi Chi's hot salsa and the peaches balanced the spice beautifully.  Served over cous cous.  Excellent!  Pork came out tender and the cornmeal crust really was unique.

Oh my goodness this was soooooooooo good!!!!  I didn't leave out the cornmeal like a lot of recommendations.  I just made sure that all the excess was shaken off.  I also seasoned a bit more with garlic powder, onion powder, lemon pepper and paprika.  I used a medium salsa and put it over noodles.  I'm definitely going to be making this again!  Delicious!!

I was actually pleasantly surprised. I did have to doctor it up with some garlic, and increase the heat. I think it all depends on the salsa you go with. Mine was definitely too mild.  I put in the whole can of black beans. This stew did not go over well with my kids. They did not like the idea of peaches and meat together.

We really enjoyed this meal.  I ommitted the peaches, and it was really tasty with Spanish rice, toritillas, sour cream, etc.  A little spicy for the young onces since I used a hot salsa.  Maybe next time I'll tone it down a bit.  We'll definitely be having this again in the near future.

I expected to like this a lot more than I did.  It wasn't bad by any means, but it isn't something I'll make again.  I agree with those who expressed that this is a bland dish; as written, it really is.  After taste-testing the near-finished product, I loaded up on cilantro, added the peach syrup from the can, seasoned it up with salt and pepper etc....  I also found the texture to be a bit undesireable; the cornmeal coating is something I could have done without.  Both of my sons said they would prefer to not have this again, and my husband said it was "pretty good for a one-time thing".  Guess that settles it.

Made recipe exactly as written.  I liked it, my husband said it was ok, and my son hated it.  So, due to the mixed reviews, I doubt I'll make it again.    There is nothing wrong with the dish, it came together quickly, the flavors mingled nicely, but my family didn't care for it.  It was a tad soupy, I'm glad I served over white rice.

Thank you Alex!  Not having any black beans on hand I used pinto beans with jalapeno peppers.  Next time I'll use the black beans.

Was kind of bland but may have been because I used mild salsa.  Had to add pepper and some other spices.  And, we don't like things spicy, by any means.

I made this dish last night using hot salsa and it was great but you have to like spicy.  The cornmeal, pork and peaches made an interesting combination that I would never have come up with myself but I will certainly use this recipe in the future.  Thanks.

This had a really unique taste.  The meat was very tender... very good!  Thanks!
