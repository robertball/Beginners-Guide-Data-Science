I liked this recipe, however I made a few alterations that really helped.  First, I grilled strips of chicken breasts instead of cubed chicken using my George Foreman (took 5 min!) and then when layering it, I added spoonfuls of salsa over the rice.  I also used cheddar instead of jack, and it worked very well. I ate mine with sour cream and extra salsa.  This has a fajita casserole taste to it, which isn't my hubby's favorite thing but he liked it, especially in the times I have made it since, where I chop the peppers and onion up smaller so they're less noticeable. Even my toddler daughter eats it!

I changed the recipe a little because I read the reviews that said it need something else.  I used 1 1/2 lbs. of chicken and 4 cups of rice.  Two cups of rice didn't seem to be enough.  I still used the same amount of milk and cream of mushroom soup.  The thing that made the big difference was that I added a package of taco seasoning to my chicken before I added the soup and milk.  I made it a second time and added a can of diced green chilies.  Sprinkle some cheddar cheese on top of the monterey jack.  Try it this way and you will love it.  A good recipe to play with and change around. Thanks.

This was a great recipe!!!!!  I did make some major changes.  First I used spanish rice from a box. Then I put chilies, cuman and cilantro to the chicken mixture.  My husband put sourcream on his.  This was creamy and really good.  I will make this again for sure.

I was the original poster of this recipe YEARS ago (before they even registered users) and I see that there is an ingredient that was omitted. It is supposed to have a package of taco seasoning added with the soup and milk. I saw at least one reviewer who suggested that change. :) I love all the ideas and suggestions from others, too. It's just what is great about AllRecipes.

This is FANTASTIC!  The only thing we did differently was to use pepperjack cheese instead of just regular jack (we like spice) and used more cheese than it called for.

This was absolutely to die for!  One of my favorite finds, ever!

Great, quick dinner!  I used a bagged, frozen pepper/onion blend, added some corn, and used Cream of Chicken instead of mushroom.  Also threw in a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles.  When it was served, I crumbled tortilla chips on top and added a dollup of sour cream.  

I think I'll try it in the crock pot next time and throw in the rice when I get home after work!

This was good stuff. I did tweak it a bit though. I sauteed my chicken with the peppers and onions and then sprinkled it all with Taco Seasoning I (from this site). I also used pepper jack cheese, and mixed the chicken mixture into the rice rather than layering it. I loved how simple this was to prepare, and I'll definitely be making it again.

I had some leftover rice and a green pepper I needed to use up, so I picked this recipe.  It was very easy to make and it tasted pretty good.  I used green onions because my wife doesn't like regular onions.  With a little effort, we got our kids to eat it, even with the peppers.  I think it probably needs something else -- maybe corn or peas or some other veggies and definitely more spices.  But overall, it was quick, easy and tasty.

Tried it but used vegetables  I had on hand, peas, carrots and corn. And didn't have white rice, had brown rice. Came out good. Added salsa for extra kick. Will make this again.

Very good.  Add 1/2 cup of your favorite salsa- we usually have some in the fridge- to the rice to make "Mexican Rice" for extra flavor.

This was very tasty. But I did modify it a bit. My husband doesn't like green peppers so I just added the red. I also added half a package of fajita season mix. And about half of a cup of garlic salsa. I also did not layer the dish. I just mixed the rice with the chicken mixture. I ate mine with sour cream and extra garlic salsa. It was a bit soupy for picking up and eating. But we had fun trying and then finally gave up and used forks. I can also see this as a good base of a taco salad. I personally loved it but I doubt I will be making it again since my hubby wasn't overwhelmingly thrilled. Thanks anyways!

It was good, one change besides the sour cream as some of you have metioned will be to add some of the cheese in a middle layer to have more cheese alaround, not just on top.

This is delicious! I used spanish rice (zatarran's) instead of white rice. 2 chicken breasts from frozen was enough meat.

I cut back on the calories by not using the tortilla and using all reduced fat items (soup, cheese, milk ETC.) and added salsa and extra spices (cumin, chili powder and garlic) Also used cheddar instead of jack, cause that is what I had and also brown rice , instead of white. In all it was pretty good for a heatlier version.. I'd make it again..

This recipe was just okay.  There was way too much rice in it, which made it taste a little bland.  After you cook the rice and the chicken mixture, it's basically finished.  You don't need to bake it in layers with the cheese on top IF you are going to put it in tortillas as the recipe suggests-- it just adds cooking time and not much else.  You can instead, mix some rice in with the chicken mixture (not as much as recipe suggests), put in tortillas, and put shredded cheese on top.

It's easy, tasty and moist, and a good option for a potluck dish (served without tortillas). It even tastes good left over.

My family loved this dish.  They couldn't get enough of it.  I added cumin and green chilis to the chicken mixture and put salsa on top of the top layer of rice and then topped it with the cheese it was fantabulous!!

it was very easy to make - my last layer was of the chicken mix before the cheese, so didn't get crunchy rice as some reviewers did. will definitely make it again. and i'll try it with shrimp and some fresh mushrooms next time.

I agree with another rater, the rice was crunchy on the top. Next time I would just put rice on the bottom. I would also use a smaller casserole dish or add more cheese. One cup is not enough. I sprinkled cumin on top of the chicken mixture and added a little salt & Pepper, which was good.

This was an interesting faux-mexican midwestern casserole. I might make it again sometime. The rice got kind of crunchy, but that was not all bad.

This recipe is bland, but okay. I added salt and pepper, and then, got it out of the oven, before it had a chance to coook, and added some salsa. I think rice is gross with tortilla shells, so I didn't use them. There is quite a bit of prepparation to this: cutting the vegetables and the chicken into cubes, and cooking it all before the final bake. It could be a little easier and quicker, I think. That's just my opinion.

This was a good recipe to make. If you like your food a little spicier add a can of rotel but I couldn't because my mom can't handle spicy food.

A good basic recipe, but the eggplant tastes so much better when it's fried instead of baked!  Also, take my advice and simmer a pot of homemade tomato sauce while the slices are frying/baking - it doesn't take much longer, and it tastes so much better.

THIS WAS REALLY EASY ONCE YOU PREPARED THE VEGETABLE. I SLICED AVACADO ON MINE. THE TIME ON THIS ONE IS A LITTLE OFF. I USED A GLASS DISH AND I CHECKED THE OVEN AT ABOUT 20 MINUTES AND IT WAS DONE. GREAT TASTE AND YOU CAN REALLY SPICE THIS UP OR LEAVE AS IS. MY FAMILY LOVED IT. THIS IS A KEEPER.

This dich is amazing, but I did have to add in seasonings (and a lot of it) to make it taste even remotely Mexican. You do not have to put it in the oven because you can just add the cooked chicken and the cheese in with the rice. Another thing, I messed up on the rice by not cooking it before I put it in with the cream of mushroom and milk, I used heavy whipping cream due to the lack of milk, and just added water and it worked beautifully. You can also use heavy whipping cream instead of milk if you are out.

This was good and healthy, but it definitely needs the taco seasoning (maybe just half a packet) that isn't listed above. I used a bag of frozen peppers and onions, fat free milk, and a 98% cream of mushroom soup. I used a nonstick spray for my skillet to avoid extra calories of oil. With the frozen veggies though, the thawed water off them would have been enough liquid. I also used instant brown rice instead of white. The cheese got rather crisp in 30 minutes, so I'd say more like 20.

This is a fun recipe.  It's good on it's own.  But, if you have leftovers, throw them in.  We used a deboned rotisserie chicken, leftover yellow and orange bell peppers, leftover white rice from CHINESE carryout.  I had some leftover corn, so I roasted it and put it in there.  I had some chicken and green peppers from a previous recipe and put them in there.  I had a little leftover spanish rice and threw it in there.  If i had some black beans they would be in there.  I cleaned out a decent portion of my fridge.  I did soak the rice in some chicken stock though.  Throw is some dallops of sour cream at serving and was delicious.

This was a great recipe from which I started...then added veggies as I had on hand; carrots, snap peas, yellow pepper; I used a rotisserie chicken and cream of celery soup; I added marjoram. I love layered casseroles!

I love this recipe.  We add fajita seasoning to the chicken, 1/2 cup salsa to the rice, and use sour cream and salsa when served.  It is great.

I found this recipe to be quite bland.  I really had to doctor it with spices to get it to taste "tex-mex".  I don't think I'd make it again.

I made a few alteration to this one: more rice and more cheese on top.  I also put cayenne pepper on the chicken to make it a little more spicy.  It got a little crunchy on top, I won't put it in as long next time.  I would also add more milk and another can of cream of mushroom soup cause it was a little dry (probably because I added more rice).  My parents loved it.  Good reheated.  Will make again.

This was just so-so in my house.. Once I had the chicken and vegetables sauteed, my husband looked horrified that I was going to add soup to the mix and make it a "casserole." I stopped there, added the rice to the chicken and vegetables (sans soup) and served as-is with grated cheese and torillas. After thinking about it, adding soup to a dish like this seemed a little weird. Go for the gusto and just have them as fajitas! Cheers!
