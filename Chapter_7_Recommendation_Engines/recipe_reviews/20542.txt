EXCELLENT!  I read previous reviews and also cut sugar back to 1 & 1/2 C. I reduced oil to 1/2 C. and then added 1/4 C. applesauce.  I didn't have self rising flour; used 1 C. All-Purpose, 1 & 1/4 tsp. baking powder and pinch of salt for every 1 C. of self-rising flour.  Cake was wonderful!  Didn't use nuts because I have two toddlers that don't do nuts yet.  I highly recommend the butterscotch chips.  Will definitely make again!

These are delicious and easy to make.  I cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups as we like to taste more apple than sugar, I used 4 cups of apples and an extra teaspoon of vanilla.  Kids and adults alike loved this recipe.  I am thinking of trying Hershey's Cinnamon Chips on top next time! Made it twice in as many days!

We absolutely LOVED this recipe!  My husband and his family (all chocolate lovers) thought this was great!  I didn't add the nuts however because of a nut allergy, but it tasted wonderful just the same...

Sorry, this was a waste of my time and apples.  Didn't like the texture or taste.  Will not make again.

I was doomed after making these just once...now everyone wants them! I don't use nuts though since my husband doesn't like them, but they taste great all the same. I tend to use more then 1 cup of butterscotch chips. That's the best part!

This is a very yummy recipe!  Instead of using oil, I used 1/2 cup light butter and 1/4 cup pancake syrup since we watch our fat and calories.  The butterscotch chips make the recipe!  Make a full recipe and watch it get devoured!

I make a version of this recipe that uses 2 1/2 cups all purpose flour instead of self-rising. 3 3/4 tsp of baking powder and 1 1/2 tsp of salt is also added. I leave the nuts out since neither my husband or I care for them, but they still taste delicious!

Absolutely fabulous.  I decreased the sugar like others did and accidentally put in an extra cup of apples.  It was still delicious!  It is moist and delicious and the pan is almost gone in the first four hours!  Will definitely be making this again!

This recipe is strikingly similar to one from a favorite cookbook of mine, the only differnces are this one adds the vanilla and calls for 1 cup of butterscotch and the cookbook version calls for 3/4 cup.  I have made this (the cookbook's way) many, many times and always get asked for the recipe.  The batter is very thick, dough like and can easily fool you into thinking you forgot to add something, lol.  Kids love this, and even friends who've said they don't like butterscotch loved these bars.  They also pack well for picnics and potlucks.

Delicious recipe! I substituted chopped fresh pears because I needed to use them. I also decreased sugar to 1 3/4 cups, added 1 tsp vanilla, decreased oil to 1/2 cup, and added a snack size serving of cinnamon applesauce. The men in my house wouldn't stop eating it! Took some to work and had great reviews too...and my house smelled wonderful for hours because of the butterscotch. Will definitely make this again...YUM!

Delicious!!!  These were very popular around here.  The only change I made was to make my own self-rising flour using flour and baking powder.  These were moist and bursting with apples.  The walnuts and butterscotch added a nice crunch and depth of flavor.  Will make again and again during apple season.

Absolutely wonderful!!  I decreased the sugar to 1 1/2 cups as suggested and I also used 1/3 veg. oil and 4 oz of unsweetened applesauce, instead of the full amount of oil as stated in the original recipe.  I also cooked the cake in a 15x10 jelly roll pan.  A perfect recipe for those extra apples at harvest time!

My family and co-workers really liked this receipe.  It smells great when it's cooking. I used less sugar and less oil, as was suggested by previous reviewers.  It was easy and it came out great.  It's even better the next day!

I added a little more apple (personal preference) but then had to add a little water at the end to thin it out because I thought I was going to break my spoon in half trying to stir it! I also poured an entire bag of butterscotch chips over the top so you can some with every bite! SOOOO GOOD!

Popular with the kids. I reduced the sugar to 1 and a 1/2 cups. I believe one improvement would be to mix the chips right into the batter in order to blend with the flavor overall, as their taste was dominant. Tart apples are not absolutely necessary. I had good results with Gala.

Made this for a school fundraiser and it was great.  Easy to make also used the all-purpose flour.  Made one batch with nuts and one without - topped them with powdered sugar.

So tasty! Made a few changes (used applesauce instead of oil, used 1 1/2 c of sugar and mixed half the chips in with the recipe and topped with the remaining half).  My boyfriend and I ate the entire batch in 2 days (while we were studying for finals....if that's an acceptable excuse).  Recipe stayed very moist for those 2 days, but I suspect it would keep moist even longer.  Thank you!

Just tried this recipe, and the resulting snack bars are delicious!  Well worth the workout that the arm gets mixing the stiff dough. Since I used All Purpose Flour, I followed the directions in an earlier review by adding baking powder and salt to the flour mixture.  Perfect recipe to use for take along meals, picnics, etc.

I made this for company yesterday and everyone loved it! It was very easy to throw together and I will make it again today for a carry-in. Next time I will cut the amount of sugar as some of the reviews suggest, as the butterscotch chips make it plenty sweet.  Apple Snack Squares are the best comfort food!

This recipe was easy and very different.  I also cut back on the sugar and substituted 1/2 brown sugar.  I only cooked it for 30 minutes and it came out perfect.  My husband, family and neighbors loved it!

I made this exactly as written and it was a HIT!  Took it with us to a winery with my daughter, son-in-law, mom and dad.  Everyone ate a piece, then went back for more.  People were actually picking the crumbs out of the container.  Definitely a keeper!  Glad I saved a few pieces back so I could have some with my morning coffee.

Made these this morning.  I didn't read all the reviews otherwise I would of cut the sugar as well as I find these way to sweet.  I didn't add the nuts as I don't like nuts in desserts but next time I will cut the sugar and use toffee bits in place of the butterscotch chips but overall its a great recipe and my hard to please significant other loved them

I had to use chocolate chips because I had no butterscotch... it was great anyway. I followed another reviewer's recipe for using AP flour with baking powder. Worked great. Will make again. Thanks!

Amazing!  Took this to a potluck and it disappeared in minutes.  The butterscotch chips add a great flavor and makes the house smell so good while it's baking!

Very yummy!  I did cut back the sugar, using just under 1 1/2 cups.  Used one egg with 2 egg whites and also used 1/3 cup canola with 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce (always swap out some oil with applesauce when I bake).  I left out the nuts as I knew my boys would prefer without and also folded the butterscotch chips into the batter.  My only error with this recipe was using too many apples (about 4 cups) as I think it contributed to extra moisture in my cake and caused some areas to be a bit 'gooey'.  Regardless, not the fault of the recipe!  Will make again for sure!

Five stars for easy, five stars for delicious, five stars for fast!  Moist and not as heavy as I was anticipating.  I added a bit more apple, combination of granny smith and red delicious, used pecans and decreased the sugar by just a quarter cup.  I also didn't have butterscotch chips but you all have to try the cinnamon chips!!!  Thank you for a great recipe.

This is great.  I made it for work, and everyone raved!  The only thing is when they say the mixture is thick, they aren't kidding.  The more you work the apples and walnuts into it, it becomes more pliable and easier to mix.

Wonderful snack food. I cut back on the sugar by 1/4 primarily because my apples were ripe, but I suspect you could anyway. In Canada we don't have self rising flour, add 1 1/4 tsp baking power for each cup of flour. I also added a light dusting of icing sugar after baked for appeal only.

This is an instant favourite.

I was surprised after I fixed this at how good it was.  I didn't include the nuts, cut the oil & used unsweetened applesauce-1 cup.  I substituted brown sugar for the white & cut that as others as suggested to 1 1/2 cups - still sweet enough.  It went over wonderfully in our home & will surely make it again.

I *LOVE* this cake!  I cut the sugar back as well bc it was seriously hurting my teeth.  1 1/2 C as previously mentioned is perfect.  I have actually made this several different ways but don't reduce the butterscotch it adds more flavor than sweetness.

Sounded great,but : followed directions but decreasing sugar,still too sweet,and baking the allowed time.  However,nicely browned outside,but like raw cookie dough inside.

A little sweet so I will cut back on the sugar as suggested in other reviews but it was delicious!  The butterscotch really sets it off.  Believe the recipe when it says thick!

Delicious - Had to make a couple changes, though. Only added 1 cup sugar and pecans instead. Added fresh ground nutmeg, and used chocolate chips instead, because that's what I had. Will definitely make again.

The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because I had to make some adjustments but it is delicious! I used 1 1/2 c. Of sugar, 4 cups of apples and baked it for 35 minutes on the middle rack and let it sit in the over for 7 more minutes after I turned it off. I will use butterscotch chips next time, definitely a keeper!

well I decided to try this recipe this afternoon. when I opened the oven, it looked beautiful in the pan! browned edges, crisp, reminded me of a pie. well when I took it out after 35 minutes of baking, cutting into the dish it was liquid! it did not bake like a cake at all. it did however make some very tasty cinnamon like apples :) will make again but need to figure out why it was not cake like!!

These are SO GOOD and so easy.  I omitted the nuts, halved the recipe, and baked in an 8x8 pan for 33 minutes--they came out perfectly.  Next time I will make a full batch!

Made these the other day and they weren't exactly what I was looking for :(  They were very "cakey" and I was hoping, because of picture, they'd be more "bar-like".  They had a nice taste however...I subbed applesauce for 1/2 the oil and did a rough chop on the apples for more texture.  I used less butterscotch chips on top because I was trying to make these healthier, however, if I make again I will mix 1/2 the bag into the batter and melt the other half in a double boiler and drizzle over the top...health be damned! LOL

I had a couple of  large gala apples in my fridge I needed a quick recipe for.  After I chopped them, it was just under 3 cups.  this is very good, very moist.  I did find it a tad sweet with the butterscotch chips, so next time will decrease the sugar a tad.  I probably wouldn't if I omitted the chips.  the combination of the butterscotch with apple is nice.   the level of spice is a personal preference.  to the 1 tsp cinnamon, I did add half tsp apple pie spice.  I never keep self-rising flour on hand.  for this recipe add:  1 1/2 tsp salt,  3 and 3/4 tsp baking powder to make the right ratio for the self-rising in this recipe.  a synch to prepare, and make a nice size thickness of a bar.  very moist and nice.

Pretty good recipe but way too sweet. I also cut sugar to 1.5  cups, increased apples to 4 cups and only topped with 1/2 cup of the butterscotch chips. Next time I will add some coconut to the dough. When I was adding the last of the flour, I had to use my hands to incorporate because it was so thick but the end result was a nice moist cake.

We liked this moist recipe.  I cut the recipe in half for an 8"x8" dish and cooked it for 35 minutes.  I cut back on the sugar but thought it was still a bit too sweet.  I used 2 parts white sugar and one part brown sugar.  Also used two parts unsweetened applesauce and one part oil.  My husband would like to try it without the butterscotch chips too.  He thinks he would like it just as well.  He loves moist cakes and this is that for sure.

I cut down on the sugar as some above did but was disappointed in the outcome. It was really, really hard for me to stir and combine even with the addition of 1/3 cup of oil. My husband said it was too dense and to not make it again. I was surprised because with all those apples I though it would be a lot more moist than it was.

3.3.16.18  I did cut back the sugar and the oil, and used some applesauce to replace some of the oil.  I had no walnuts, so I used pecans, and had a small amount of Reeses® peanut butter chips on hand, so I mixed them in with the  butterscotch chips.  This turned  out really, really well.  I actually made a mistake, but I think it worked to the advantage of the recipe.  I used 3 apples which I'm sure was more than 3 cups.  After I chopped the apples, I thought, whoa, that’s a lot of apples for this cake.  Well, all of those apples just made this cake so light, moist and tender, and the fruit flavor definitely comes through in every bite.  Just one comment, and that is we liked the peanut butter chips better than the butterscotch which seemed a bit too sweet for our taste, so I definitely will use peanut butter chips in the future.  Thank you for sharing this recipe, it is a winner!

Increased apples to 4 cups. Put the chopped walnuts on top of the bars before baking and sprinkled with 1/2 cup butterscotch chips instead of 1 cup.

In the oven....oh, Geeze, I'm drooling...!  Lol.  Ok, I did a couple of tweeks .... Put a cup & 1/2 of raisins ( soaked in hot water for 20 min.), added a tsp. of ginger &  cardamom.  I Love these spices!  And, lastly I thought I had butterscotch chips, didn't , but, did have cinnamon chips...so, what the heck ?  
Can't wait till they're out of the oven!  Going to share them with my granddaughters ...for lunches or after school snacks.  They do love their Nana...lol.
