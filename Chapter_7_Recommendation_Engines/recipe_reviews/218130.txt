The inside didn't cook all the way through, but they were lifting up the lid to the grill to turn corn, so we think that is why.. otherwise, it is good but different.. more like a dessert meal.  I think it is good for kids who are picky and don't like barbequed chicken

I liked this - my husband found it too vinegary however I used 5 chicken thighs and then everything else the same except I only used 1 1/2 Tsp nutmeg. And it was freezing rain out so I didn't want to BBQ so I preheated my oven to 550 then when it was hot turned it off and the broiler on and cooked the chicken on the higher rack. We wanted something simple after eating rich food over the holidays and this chicken basmati rice and steamed asparagus & carrots did the trick!

Very different taste to the chicken using ground cinnamon. I made 2 types of grilled thighs for dinner this one and 'Big Al's Chicken' and I preferred the taste of this one. I marinated the thighs (only parts used) all day. The skin does get very dark like the picture shows but it was NOT burnt. Served this with 'Alison's Colcannon and Cauliflower with Dijon Sauce' both AR recipe. Everything together made for a really good dinner. Thanks whey2big4u for sharing your recipe.

Had to substitute the lemon for lime and cooked on a grate on the stove. The texture of the mix was a little grainy and the taste was a bit overpowering. Suggest reduced vinegar and definitely cook on a grill.

Easy to fix but I will never make it again. I doused mine in bbq sauce but the cinnamon and apple cider vinegar didn't come together as well as I had hoped. Instead it gave it a tang that was less than fortunate.

The flavour from the lemon juice and vinegar took over the dish and masked any chicken flavour.
