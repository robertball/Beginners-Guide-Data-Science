I thought this was a good recipe.  It tasted a bit bland (I used healthy versions of the condensed soup) so I seasoned with salt, pepper and garlic powder.  I also used one can cream of chicken and one can cream of celery soup.  I took the advice of using milk instead of water also.  I also used Stove Top Savory Herbs stuffing mix as my topping (a great addition).  Try this recipe...you'll like it!

Delicious comfort food. I cut the chicken into chunks (used 2 full breasts) and used turkey stuffing on both the bottom and top of the casserole, as suggested. I used a touch more sour cream (to finish off a package), and I added some pepper, dehydrated onions and garlic powder. This is really easy to put together and I will definitely make this again! (extra note: I assume that it's a type in the 2nd part of the directions, and we are to COVER the dish for the 1st 30 minutes-- not sure we can uncover something that's not covered, ha. That's what I did anyway, and it worked out fine.)

Added more broccoli, sour cream, fresh cracked black pepper and garlic powder. Used turkey stuffing on top as well as on the bottom of the pan before I put the other ingredients in the pan. A little bland, however. Next time, I would added some diced onions for a little extra flavor. Overall, this was comfort food and the more I ate, the more I liked it.

My husband and I really liked this recipe and I'll definitely make it again. I used 4 chicken breast halves rather than 3 and I cut the chicken up into bite size chunks rather than leaving whole. I used milk rather than 1 1/4 cups water to make it a little more creamy. The only things I might change the next time I make this is to add a layer of stuffing on the bottom and a sprinkle of cheese on top. May also add a little more broccoli and sour cream. I thought this was a pretty good recipe...Thanks!

i did not like this recipe.  I felt like it was missing something, maybe rice or noodles or something.  I will not make this dish again.

Found this recipe while browsing for something to cook for dinner. It was a real hit at my house! I did add a bit more sour cream after reading previous reviews. I had a bit of leftover rice which I put under the chicken, so it made it more of a "one dish meal.". I used "garlic and herb" seasoned bread crumbs. This one's a keeper for a quick and easy dinner. Recipe does need some corrections in specifying "chicken breasts" and to "cover" for first 30 minutes.

I added a couple more tablespoons of sour cream, 1tsp of chopped garlic, 1/2 tsp of Italian Seasonings to the sauce. I also used milk instead of water. I cubed the chicken into bite size pieces, and I covered the bread crumbs with grated marble cheese...was very good! Definitely will be making it again!

This was just 'ok'.  Not much flavor and I even added S&P, Garlic Powder and used milk as someone suggested. I used fresh broccoli and it was very over cooked and soggy.

I cut down the recipe & made it for 4 and it turned out great!!  I made some changes though... I cubed the chicken and cooked in on the stove tope with EOO & minced garlic.  I added in garlic powder & pepper into the soup/water/sour cream (which I used 2tbsp) mixture and then instead of bread crumbs, I toasted 2 slices of bread & crumbled it ontop of everything.  Then after uncovering it, I sprinkled a small amount of cheese on it.  My husband LOVED it!  Next time, I want to add in some mushrooms!

SOOOO good. This was a hit with my whole family. I did use the Stovetop Stuffing for the topping and cut the chicken into long, thick strips. So good.

I used 3 seasoned chicken breasts, cubed.  Used 1 can cream of chicken, 1 can cream of celery, 1 can of water plus about 1/3 cup or so of sour cream. I layered 1/2 the frozen broccoli, mixed the chicken cubes into the soup mix and poured half over the broccoli, then repeated and topped it all off with cheese.  Cooked for about 30 minutes

I used one can of cream of chicken and one can of cream of celery, substituted milk for the water and also used Pepperidge Farm stuffing on the bottom as well as on the top, plus sprinkled cheddar cheese on top.  I probably would have liked this more had I used more stuffing on the top but since my husband doesn't like bread crumbs/stuffing as much as I do, I didn't use as much.  Still a good filling recipe.

I think the key to this recipe is the soup used. I used one can Cream of Broccoli and the other was Creamy Herb Chicken.   I also increased the sour cream by about 2 tablespoons, added onion powder, garlic powder and pepper.   Also added about 1/2 cup of cheddar to the liquid mixture and added about 3/4 of a cup to the bread crumb mixture.  Minor changes but I think they made it better.

My family demolished this dish! Especially unbelievable because they usually balk at anything broccoli. I made it in my slow cooker instead and wow, was it moist and delicious.  My alterations to the recipe:  5-6 frozen boneless chicken breasts, 1 package frozen broccoli, 2 extra tbsp of sour cream, milk instead of water, olive oil sprayed bottom of crockpot, frozen chicken breasts in bottom first, seasoned with salt, garlic & pepper, italian bread crumbs, tossed frozen broccoli around it, added cubed Velveeta cheese around the chicken, mixed with the soup, sour cream, and milk with a whisk, dumped over top, and more italian bread crumbs thoroughly thick over the mixture. The Velveeta cheese and bread crumbs with the soup made it brown and crusty on top. You could probably add any kind of stuffing, but all I had was bread crumbs. I put my slow cooker on high from 11:30 am until 3-3:30pm (about 4 hrs on high), and then on warm until the family ate at 4:30pm. Cut up the chicken into smaller pieces. Served it over white rice.  There was a lot of sauce left over, so with my 3 boys and hubby's ravenous appetites, I'm going increase it to make it with 6-8 frozen chicken breasts next time, and an extra half bag of frozen broccoli will probably make it chunkier instead of soupy.

I didn't care for this recipe.  If you're the type of person who loves broccoli cheese soup, you'll love this.  It's just not my thing.

This is a 4 star base with a lot of room for your own original improvement. I make it with a lot of vegetables, not just broccoli; stuffing mix over bread crumbs on top and bottom; sometimes I add cheese on top before the layer of stuffing mix. I also tend to make it in a bigger pan, so I add more veggies and a can of chicken gravy. You really can't go wrong with this.

I used everyone's tips for this recipe and ended up with cubing the chicken, pre-cooking it with EVOO & garlic, using milk instead of water, and extra sour cream.  My little personal addition was adding a few chopped jalapenos into the sauce and then putting the chicken & broccoli in the pan first and the pouring the sauce over.  

I like it! But I need to figure out a way to make more of a crust on top.

Well, I changed and added a few things and my husband and kids loved it.  I cut the chicken into chunks.  I substituted mayo instead of sour cream because I was out.  Then I stirred the chicken and broccoli into the soup mixture and poured into dish.  I put a layer of swiss cheese over it.  I used bagged sage and onion flavored stuffing mix which I moistened with chicken broth and topped the swiss cheese.  I added butter to the top and baked.  It was really good and I will make again.

I thought this was pretty average, but my fiance loved it! Good way to use up leftover sour cream though. And at least it is a good way to get my man to eat his greens, so I will make it again becuase of that.

Good starter recipe. I followed other suggestions and added milk instead of water. I also added garlic salt, onion powder, basil, oregano, salt and pepper. I added more sour cream then it called for. I also used crushed seasoned croutons as well as grated chedder cheese which I mixed in with the chicken mixture and spread above the croutons. My husband LOVED this.

Awesome recipe!!! Added 1 chopped white onion to the liquid. Added an addition tablespoon of sour cream. Cubed the chicken. I also added 2 cups of rice to the casserole to make it more complete. Finally, I only used 1/4 cup of bread crumbs. This is a keeper!

Used natural yoghurt instead of sour cream and leftover chicken stuffing.  Great recipe - kids loved it and its a great filler dinner.  Will try it with some herbs next time to add to the flavour.

Everyone had seconds even my picky child. My husband stated more than once how much he liked it. Thanks!

NOT WORTH MAKING AGAIN. I don't understand all the great reviews.... NO ONE in my family liked it. It's not gross or real bad, just not good. BUT, if I had to make it again, I'd DEFINITELY salt the broccoli at little first.

Taste was missing something even after adding poultry seasoning, season salt, pepper, and onion powder.  I also added some cheddar cheese, tripled the sour cream, and eliminated one can of soup.  This won't become a 'go to' recipe, but thanks for sharing.

For a crunchier crust, try crumbling Ritz crackers on top.  I use 2 tbsp sour cream and 2 tbsp mayo also.

My husband adored this casserole. But I did use canned green beans instead of brocolli, because I was out, and I added garlic and cheese.

We loved this.  I added some curry powder (about 1/2 teaspoon), some green onions and mushrooms, and it was fabulous.  I'll definitely be making this again!

This was a little better than okay.  I did use the Stovetop Stuffing for the topping and cut the chicken into long, thick strips. Maybe I'll cube the chicken next time?
