This was creamy,decadent,and delightful! To serve it I painted melted chocolate onto the insides of paper muffin liners and popped them into the frig. for about 30 minutes. When the chocolate was hardened I peeled the paper off and filled the chocolate cups with the mousse.

Very dangerously good.  I'll need to hold back on how often this is made.  I've decided to use a smoother/richer cocoa powder than Hershey's & use real butter.  Since I know it is a lustful dessert, why not go all the way & waddle.

This stuff is great - I poured it into (bought) cupcake-size chocolate cups and served it with grated chocolate on top - yum!

I love this recipe, and a friend of mine requests I make it all the time.  I serve it in chocolate shells made from foil baking cups, and it's both pretty and delicious!

This mousse was quite a hit! I heated it slowly, and it turned out very smooth and creamy. Refrigerated it a few hours, and it set up nicely. I topped it with a dollop of whipped cream and a few chocolate shavings.  My guests were impressed!

this has a great sweet flavor, but had the texture of runny whipped cream, not firm enough to really be mousse.  i would not make this again as a mousse, but maybe as flavored whipped cream.

This was really really really sweet. The coffee also gave it a weird grainy texture. I didn't like it.

VERY EASY AND QUICK DESSERT. THE LONGER YOU LET IT SET THE MORE CAPPUCINO FLAVOR GOES THROUGH. MY 4 Y/O EVEN LOVED IT! DEFINATELY WILL MAKE AGAIN, BESIDES HOW CAN YOU GO WRONG WITH SWEETENED CONDENSED MILK?

Chocolate & Coffee... can life really get any better then this? ;)  This is a great milk chocolate mouse.  I also enjoy making it a darker chocolate by adding more cocoa powder.

Absolutely delicious!  Mine was also a little grainy but it didn't detract from the taste.  Garnished with grated chocolate and it disappeared at a family lunch. Thanks for submitting.

This was really good.  Mine was a little grainy, but I probably didn't stir it long enough.  Since we don't drink coffee, I only used 1 tsp of coffee and that was plenty for us.  Will make again!  Thanks!

Served this at my sister's anniversary party and everyone wanted the recipe.  This was the easiest thing to make and soooo impressive.  Do not increase the coffee amount as there was plenty of coffee taste.

I think this would have been better with out the coffee flavour. It made the mousse a little bitter. Other than that it was very easy to make and tasted pretty good.

I used this as a topping for "Chocolate Lover's Favorite Cake." (Also a recipe on this site.) This stuff is so heavenly - It has a very smooth, creamy and rich taste that easily beats the storebought boxed versions. Just the right amount of coffee flavor, but this can be eliminated if you prefer.

This gets five stars because not only was it easy to make but it was a delight to serve.  The mousse turned out thick and creamy with a rich taste.  The only recommendation I would make is make sure you cook the syrup slowly or little particles of chocolate end up in the mousse.

Very good mousse.  Rather than the dried coffee crystals in water, I just poured in a little already made coffee from the morning.  After the mixture had cooked, I used my hand mixer on it to get rid of any lumps that might have formed.  This needs to chill several hours in the fridge to set up properly.  Enjoyed this very much.

Yummy! Very strong coffee flavor. I used fat free sweetened condensed milk.
