Goodness that is a tasty dish! It's not a triple threat (fast,easy,tasty) but the incredible flavor still warrants the 5star rate. When the family came to the table my husband said it looks like restaurant food with the presentation. The flavor did not let us down. Prep time wasn't accurate for me. This recipe is not hard but a bit time consuming. I will use this recipe again for a "sit-down" dinner party. I would very likely make the pesto and red pepper sauce ahead of time and warm just before serving.

We thought it was wonderful!  We kind of just made it with what we already had in the refrigerator.  We omitted roasted red peppers (didn't have them) and substituted the walnuts with pecans.  Makes a very rich sauce. Yum.

I screwed up this recipe and combined all the ingredients making a single sauce instead of a base sauce and pesto. Despite my mistake, this recipe was amazing! I can't wait to try it again, the right way this time.

This was excellent!  I made it using what I had on hand.   I did not have jarred bell peppers on hand.  I had fresh mini bell peppers - a mixture of red, orange, and yellow.  I roasted them myself and used those for the sauce.  I also did not have any shallots, but the sauce was still very good.  I can't wait to try it with the shallots next time!  For the pesto sauce...I have a basil plant, so I made basil pesto using my regular pesto recipe.  We made grilled asparagus to serve on the side.  This will definitely be made again throughout the summer.  My 4 year old even said "This is amazing, mommy!"

I made this for my hubby as he is the only one in our house that enjoys mahi mahi.  He said if he could he would rate it a 10.  I followed the directions to a "T".

Wow, my husband said this was 5 star restaurant quality! The only thing I changed was I sauteed the fish in a fry pan with a little butter...skin side up at first. And the only reason why I did it that way was because my grill ran out of gas just as I was ready to put it on. Thanks for sharing!

Excellent. The only changes I made were to add a little lemon to the pesto and the tuna and throw a little white wine mixed with cornstarch in my pepper sauce at the end to bind it. Neither of these changes were crucial - this recipe is wonderful as is. Thanks!!

this is the first time I'm rating a recipe but this was absolutely delicious! I used Tilapia instead of Mahi Mahi because I couldn't find any and I grilled it in the oven but it turned out perfect. The Roasted Pepper sauce with the Cilantro pesto go so well together my whole family was asking for more! thank you for sharing!

We were slightly disappointed with this recipe. We followed the recipe pretty closely, using home roasted  red peppers and subbing half a red onion for the shallot. We grilled the mahi mahi on our Cuisinart Griddler. We thought the red pepper puree to be lacking and didn't go with the cilantro pesto on top (I loved the taste of it by itself and I will make in the future for other dishes). Overall, this was not a cohesive dish and we won't be making it again.

I thought this was a good recipe and I was also glad that I had all of the ingredients on hand. I cut the recipe in half but still would have liked a little more pesto. I made some changes to the recipe though and I think it made a nice difference.
1.) I baked the Mahi Mahi
2.) I added pine nuts to the pesto and not walnuts...Some were ground up and some I kept whole.
3.) For the red pepper sauce I added some cumin, paprika, chili powder and a few shakes of crushed red pepper. That really gave the sauce the "pep" that I think some people were looking for.

My husband and I loved this recipe and I will surely make the sauces again for other dishes.

this recipe was really, really good. i replaced the shallot with onion simply because i couldn't locate a shallot. i also used a fresh red bell pepper. i cored and sliced it, then roasted it in the oven on 400 degrees F for about 20 minutes. fantastic!

FANTASTIC! My husband and I loved it.  I was worried at first reading the different flavors that would all be mixed together, but this was amazing!  I'm so glad I have leftovers!  I also made quinoa and used that as a base for the meal instead of rice.  While the quinoa was cooking I put a little of the red pepper sauce in with it to help flavor it more, then put it on the plate with some more of the red pepper sauce on top of that, the fillet and then the pesto.  Tasted great, and had some char-grilled veggies on the side.  I will totally make this again!

My minor changes are as follows:
1-added a little more garlic and ground pepper to the pesto since my husband and I like those flavors a lot
2-used pecans instead of walnuts because that is what I had on hand
3-dried the fish fillets before putting some pepper and salt over it, let it sit over night and basted the fillets with olive oil right before grilling to keep the fish moist
4-I roasted the peppers myself instead of using a jar of roasted red peppers

Fresh ingredients make this A+
I love how the flavors of both sauces compliment each other AND the fish! 
A great & easy dish, yes it's easy even though it looks like alot of work, to impress your guests with. I used a mini food processor $30 from JCPenney. Worked awesome! Will definately make again!

I have been searching for a great Mahi recipe and this by far is the best I have tried (with slight substitutions). We are not big fans of cilantro so I made the basil pesto instead.  Still turned out great.  Can't wait to make it again, it's so easy.

This recipe takes some time to make, but it is delicious.  We made it with red snapper fish.  Either the red pepper sauce or the cilantro pesto sauce alone would be great with fish, but their combination is especially tasty.

The roasted red pepper sauce was yummy but other than that I felt like the it was not super great.  The Cilantro Pesto turned out a little bit thick so it didn't process well.

The cilantro pesto in this recipe is brilliant, however, I felt the roasted red pepper sauce fell a little flat. I think it may have been the shallot. Also, while the flavors went well together, it can be a little overpowering for such a light fish. It may be best to go with one or the other, preferably the pesto.

Very pretty recipe and super easy to make. My lucky 7 year old ate it without complaining and the 5 year old gobbled it up. Cilantro was a nice flavor, but the pepper sauce was a little bland. Minor tweaking there would make this a five star recipe.

I LOVED this recipe!!  My family enjoyed the mahi mahi without the sauces.. so sad- since I loved the flavor combinations.  Beautiful presentation for little effort it took- really easy :)  Will use the roasted red pepper sauce for other dishes too- yummy!  I used basil instead of cilantro (I prefer basil- although cilantro is quite a bit cheaper) and I also used pecans.  I wish I would have had time to pick up pinenuts, to make a true pesto- but it was wonderful none the less.  Will make again.

Probably is "restaurant" quality overall. Beautiful presentation & great flavor. A lot of the cost is in the shallot/pepper sauce but the real winning flavor is in the cilantro pesto. But sauces are complimentary, both in flavor & in presentation. Make both sauces ahead if possible, seasoning both to taste adding salt & sugar to red sauce to alleviate slight bland, bitterness as other reviewers mentioned. Grill fish, reheat sauces & serve immediately as warm as possible on warm plates! We served this with a nice rice pilaf & roasted mixed vegetables....talk about a colorful, healthy plate!  Very good recipe!

This was simple and delicious, i made it for family who normally don't like fish and they devoured it! I doubled the garlic and the parm. cheese, just because i knew that's what my family would like! Great recipe thanks

I really cannot believe how delicious this dish is.  It is restaurant quality!  I pan-fried my mahi-mahi and followed the rest of the recipe as written, except for adding a pinch of sugar to the red pepper sauce.  The presentation was gorgeous and the flavors of the fish, sauce, and pesto went brilliantly together.  I tasted the sauce before serving and kind of went "ewww" but when served, it was wonderful in combination with everything else.  Beautiful presentation!  Quite a few dirty dishes but worth it.  I only made one chunk of fish per person and should have made more.  Plenty of sauce/pesto left over.  For company I will make the sauce and pesto ahead of time and reheat.  Thanks for this WONDERFUL recipe!!

I wish I had taken a photo. Beatiful colors especially if you serve this with yellow rice. This is also very simple to make as long as you have a good food processor. Unfortunately, while heating the grill, the dog ate my freshly caught mahi while unsupervised. The grocery store was out of mahi.  My point? This recipe works great with tilapia a well!

This was mmm mmm good! So fresh. The pepper sauce went very well over a bed of brown rice. I added a little of the sauce to the water while cooking the brown rice. I have a some leftover pesto and sauce that I plan to use on chicken tomorrow. FYI this is the first time I've chose to write a review, it was that good!

Hands down one of the most delicious meals I have ever made!!! Followed the recipe exactly but splashed some fresh lemon juice on the fish while grilling. Beautiful presentation. Served with sauteed zucchini and squash.

An excellent dish.  My wife and I eat fish at least twice a week and always look for varied ways to enhance the fish. The smoky flavor of the sauce coupled with the pesto was a perfect fit.

Great dish!!!!  This worked out wonderfully for us.  I worked on the sauces whil my husband preheated the grill & did the fish.  He doesn't like red peppers, so he was happy there were 2 different sauces!  We both LOVED it!  I love pesto anyway, and this was yummy.  I love the garlic in it.  Didn't have walnuts, so I used pecans.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.  I will plan on making this again.

This was phenomenal! It was restaurant-quality food made right in my own kitchen. I'm on a cilantro kick, so the pesto was absolutely perfect. Even my fish-wary husband begged me to make it again, "just the same way." Thanks for a fantastic recipe!

This was pretty good. I found the pepper sauce to be quite bitter and a bit bland, so I added a bit of sugar to cut it and a low sodium chicken bouillon cube. I also made it a few days ahead of time (unexpectedly didn't use it immediately) and the flavor had much improved. I used regular pesto that I had on hand and the dish came out fine.

This recipe was great without the roasted pepper sauce. I'll try it with both the sauce and the pesto sometime, but I'm glad I tried it out with just the pesto (I didn't have roasted red peppers on hand). It had a great fresh taste!

Sometimes I actually put the fish between the awesome sauce and the FANTASTIC pesto. Leftover sauce gets tossed  with pasta and more cheese and the leftover pesto gets spread on lightly toasted bread. Another easy meal. Divine.

My daughter made this recipe and it was absolutely one of the most wonderful meals ever.  The flavors of the dish explode in your mouth and melt away so nicely.  All I could say is 'Oh My God this is awesome!' the entire meal.  My husband who will not eat fish, tried the two sauces and loved them alone.   I can't wait for my daughter to make this again- I'll even buy all the ingredants...hint hint.

This recipe was amazing! The pesto is really flavorful and compliments the fish well. The red pepper sauce was great too, just little too acidic for my taste so I added a teaspoon or two of sugar and it cut the strong acidic taste right down. I also added a bit of chicken stock to my wine. I made roasted creamer potatos and a ceasar salad to go with it. This was one of the best meals I've made in a while. I suggest you try this out!

My husband loved this dish, thought the Pepper sauce and Cilantro pesto complemented each other very well.  The only change I made was to roast fresh red bell peppers and the grill, instead of canned peppers.

I had high hopes for this.  My husband and I thought the red pepper sauce was really bland.  The cilantro pesto was the best part.  I would not make this again, though I would make the pesto again.

Sorry guys, but we didn't like this one a whole lot.  It seemed to me that the red pepper sauce actually tasted like tomato sauce.  After reading the reviews I was so excited, and I must say that it just didn't fulfill my expectations.

Excellent recipe!  I used prepared basil pesto since I don't care for cilantro and it was delicious!  I served it with gnocchi and peas, with a nice white wine.  Like at a restaurant, and it only took 30 minutes at most.

It's a little time consuming to make both the sauce and the pesto, but well worth it. Like an another reviewer said, this dish is restaurant quality in taste and presentation. The flavors go really well together. My family loved it.

I made this recipe as listed. The overall flavor of everything was great, but I had some problems with consistency. My roasted pepper puree looked nice and creamy until I added the butter at the end - then it turned runny. And my pesto, was more like a paste with the amount of olive oil the recipe calls for.

I'd make it again, making sure I have a heap more olive oil on hand, and either omitting or reducing the amount of butter for the roasted pepper sauce.

This is outstanding.  I made ifI for company and they enjoyed it a lot.  My husband is still talking about it.  Definitely a keeper.  To simplify things I made up the sauce the day before.  I had some small shrimp in the freezer and I tossed them into the sauce.  Definitely will make this many times.

Absolutely delicious!  The cilantro pesto was really good. Loved it.  The roasted pepper sauce was great too but I I didn't make it exactly as written.  I didn't have the jarred red peppers so I used fresh.  Diced them up very small and sautéed them with a little butter, onion and a small amount of chicken broth. (didn't have any wine)  This turned out great.  Grilled the Mahi Mahi and served it with both the red pepper mixture and cilantro pesto.  Next time I will make it exactly as written.  This is  a real keeper.  The husband loved it and it is a very attractive dish and easy to make.

Substituted grilled tuna steaks for the Mahi Mahi.  Incredible dish.  Couldn't imagine getting a better meal in a restaurant. Can't wait to serve it to friends.

Used a fresh red bell pepper instead and turned out great. Also cooked the fish a little longer than the directions said due to it being a thick piece. Love both of the sauces came out great!

We enjoyed this tonight, but it isn't our favorite mahi mahi recipe. It doesn't sound like it would work, but it all surprisingly does. I made half a recipe and had trouble getting the smaller amounts to blend properly in my blender and had to add another teaspoon of EVOO to get it to kind of come together.  Do make both the red pepper sauce and the pesto early to allow the flavors to meld.  We will have again when we're in the mood for something different.  Thanks for the unique recipe.

Made this with swordfish which I grilled (5 minutes one side 3 on the other with just salt and pepper - my filets were at least an inch thick if not a bit more). The pepper sauce was fantastic and the pesto was a great addition. My plates looked fabulous. Served with brussel sprouts and sautéed zucchini.

We tried this recipe tonight because we had leftover roasted red peppers from Easter antipasto.  I give it a 10 for looks, it was beautiful, but a 3 for taste.  I don't think the different tastes complimented each other at all.  The smokiness of the peppers was no good with the freshness of the pesto or the delicate taste of the fish.  I will not do this dish again.  I will try the sauce with other dishes however, because it was very good.

SUPER YUM! This year, I decided to shake things up a bit and serve a seafood entree instead of the usual pasta for our Christmas Eve dinner. Both my parents, my husband and I were not disappointed in the least!!! Not only was this elegant AND delicious, it was very festive! The red pepper sauce and green pesto tied right into our holiday theme (and I didn't even plan it that way lol!). :) Despite the thermometer dipping below 32 degrees, my hubs grilled our filets on his Weber (but I think using an indoor grill would have worked just as well). Roasted asparagus, a (boxed) roasted red pepper / basil quinoa mix and rosemary foccacia bread rounded out our meal. I'm not sure this is BETTER than pasta (sorry, it's become a tradition I can't overlook...), but it's darn yummy for sure! Thanks for sharing your unique recipe, CookinginFL!!! :-)

As delicious as it was beautiful! I made the sauce and pesto a day ahead, so when my company arrived all I had to do was grill the fish and warm up the pepper sauce! Everyone raved!.....I did need to add more salt to the sauce than it called for--just my taste.

Yummy! Changed a few things to use what I had on hand. Used regular onion instead of shallot - not sure if that made a difference or not. The pesto was really garlic-y, so a little goes a long way! I also used almonds and pecans because I didn't have walnuts. For the sauce, I roasted one red bell pepper instead of using a jar - still made plenty. Baked the fish so I didn't have to drag out the grill. I'm sure the grill flavor would only add to the yumminess! We served it with white rice made with olive oil and added cilantro. Looks fancy, tastes delicious!

Didn't change a thing and it was awesome. My boyfriend and I grilled the mahi mahi in a grill pan, and served it with roasted baby red potatoes with margarine and rosemary, and with grilled asparagus (brushed with olive oil, sprinkled with salt and pepper, and then kept warm in the oven, with a little shredded parmesan cheese on top and covered while the fish cooked). Pretty and delicious!

This is a very good and delicious recipe for any white fish. The sauces both are delicious and supplement each other very well. In my opinion, the recipe makes a little less pesto, so next time I would double the proportions. I didn`t have a grill, so baked my fish, it was very delicious too.

I had to use halibut bc there wasn't any mahi mahi but it was still good.  The red pepper sauce was really good and the pesto was pretty good too but it was very strong.  The reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is because I don't think the sauces together make it a cohesive dish but I would still make this again with just the red pepper sauce. Thanks for the recipe!

My wife and I absolutely LOVE this recipe! The red pepper sauce and cilantro pesto really make it special. Not only does it taste great, it looks great on the plate. I added a bit of cayenne to the pepper sauce for some bite and used a red wine instead of white. It's so good, I'm using the leftover pesto and pepper sauce to make it again tomorrow!

This recipe was absolutely delicious and very easy to make.  I followed the directions exactly except for using salmon instead of mahi mahi.  Both me and my boyfriend loved it.  The only downside, if you can even called it that, is that there was tons of both sauces leftover...can you freeze?

Excellent.  My BF caught a dolphin this past weekend and I was looking for a good recipe to prepare.   I prepared as written and it was lovely and the presentation was fabulous!

Delicious! I made a three substitutions based on what I had on hand. Because of a tree nut allergy I used sunflower seeds instead of walnuts, but will either omit the sunflower seeds or significantly cut this next time in the cilantro pesto, as it tasted too strong of sunflower seeds. I'm sure it is better with the walnuts, as the original recipe calls for! I also roasted my own peppers, and used a little garlic instead of the shallot. My husband raved about the red pepper sauce, and said he would have liked this sauce by itself. I preferred the compliment of the cilantro.   To save time, I will double the red pepper sauce, and stick some in the freezer for a faster meal on another date. It should freeze really well, although I will make the cilantro pesto fresh. I will definitely make this again soon!

This got rave reviews from my family. My father said he couldnt't imagine eating mahi mahi any other way now. I prepared the recipe as followed for the most part, although the cilantro pesto had too intense of a raw garlic flavor for my tastes, so I increased the amount of the other pesto ingredients.  In the future I think I'll reduce it to one clove of garlic.

This is wonderful. Give yourself plenty of time to prepare this recipe because the pesto took forever! The amount of pesto is small so my blender was a bit big for it. I had to stop and scrape and pulse it over and over. Eventually I gave up so it was a bit crunchy but I liked it! Maybe it would make sense to double the pesto and save some for another meal. It would be great on shrimp or chicken. I broiled the mahi mahi and served it with rice and sauteed brussels sprouts. Be sure to use a dry white wine such as pinto grigio because the roasted red peppers can be quite sweet. I let the roasted red pepper sauce reduce for a while so it was thicker. Make sure you drain the peppers well because the juice can hide in the bowl of the peppers and make the sauce too thin. Both the pepper sauce and the pesto need salt and pepper before serving. Definitely try this recipe..it's great for guests if you make the sauces ahead of time. Feels like a beautiful restaurant meal! Thanks for sharing it!

The only things I did differently were to use ahi tuna steaks, and I cooked them on the Foreman grill. This dish is quite a lot of work but, man, it is so worth it! The sauce and pesto work beautifully together, and look so pretty. Really amazing flavors. I can't recommend this enough. Thanks so much!
