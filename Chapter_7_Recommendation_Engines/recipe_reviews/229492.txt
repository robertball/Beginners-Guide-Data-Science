Made as written and even though the green olives seemed odd, they worked! The thing that didn't work was the cheese.  I think things would work better if you just put the cheese over the top of the corn mix so that it creates a crust. Cheddar mixed in with wet corn, olives, etc.  does not melt well and when it does finally melt it decides to do so at the bottom of the dish taking half of the corn with it to its demise against the will of the non stick spray.  I recommend saving the cheese for the top or either using a better melting cheese.
