I've been making this for years and you can also do the simpler, quicker version (using same amts. - except for sugar). Using a large pan,  cut the bacon in smaller, bite size pieces.  Cook bacon - put aside - cook onion in bacon fat until it starts to brown, then add vinegar, stir,add cooked fresh green beans or canned, add the bacon, season with pepper.  As a note:  I never added sugar - I might try that and amount of vinegar for your taste.  I prefer plain old white  vinegar with this dish. This is a good dish to make ahead because the flavor gets more intense.

These are the mosty tasty green beans on the planet!  I made a few modifications based on previous reviews.  First, I cut the bacon into small-ish cubes.  Then, I sauteed the onions in the bacon fat. I used fairly lean bacon, so there was not too much grease.  I put the sauteed onions & bacon in the pan, and made the marinade separately as the instructions call for.  Leaving the beans to marinate overnight is THE BEST way to get a really good flavor.  Fantastic recipe!!!

My husband really loved this!  He thought the onions in it was cabbage...it was reminiscent of hot German sweet & sour cabbage.  Very good!

My husband was blown away with this recipe...he said, "I can eat this anytime!"  We both agreed with other reviewers that the bacon should be cut into smaller pieces, either before or after cooking.  I think I would make another change and pour most of the marinade over the green beans/onions in the casserole dish then mix, then layer on the bacon and pour a remaining dab of marinade over the bacon.  Most of my marinade ended up on only the bacon

I used frozen beans, and it was still very good, although I want to try it with fresh.  I cut the bacon into smaller, bit-sized pieces, and then as other reviews suggested fried the onions in the bacon fat, which made them really delicious.  The tang of the vinegar was great!

This was GREAT! I made this for Thanksgiving Day. Everyone LOVED it! I had to triple the recipe and give everyone some to take home. I did make some changes that made it a little easier. I microwaved the bacon, saved the drippings and put it in a skillet, then added the onions and 2 tbl. spoons of the cider ving. and sugar, then I sauted them and poured the boiled greenbeans into a caserole dish and poured the bacon drippings mixure over the green beans, then I added walnuts instead of slivered almonds and I cut up the bacon and mixed everything together into the caserole dish and refrigerated it over night, then I baked it on 350 for 30 minutes right before the dinner was served. Everyone loved it so much that they all wanted to take some home. This is definately a keeper!

I had this recipe at a friends house for dinner last weekend.  They are so very tasty.  I would definately make them for a crowd.  The almonds were left out but it still had 100% flavor! Even my picky husband liked them!

I've been using this recipe for family get-togethers for the past couple of years, and it's never failed to garner rave reviews! I prefer to use brown sugar, and for an interesting variation, try adding 1 tsp. of maple syrup. Excellent recipe!

This was really good!  Got even better day by day as we went through the leftovers.  I hesitate to review a recipe that I have changed, but the only thing I changed here was the method, not the ingredients.  I cut up the bacon and browned, then sauteed the onions in the bacon grease, put it all together with the cooked green beans and poured the vinegar mixture over.  Great make ahead dish and everyone loved it!

I tried this with white sugar and then followed another reviewers suggestion of using brown sugar. Will always use brown sugar......made a great recipe even better.

I think this dish is awesome. You can always reduce the suger and vinegar to your liking but I recommend using the original amount first. I did cook the onions in the grease. My husband is not a "die hard" bacon lover like my family. However, he loved them.  I made these 3 years for Thanksgiving and they were gobbled up.  They were gone this turkey day as well.

These were great!  I also sauteed the onions since for me, the more cooked the better when it comes to onions, but otherwise followed the directions exactly.  Although these green beans are probably not the healthiest, they are the tastiest.  The recipe sounds a little odd, but you've got to try this!  Yummy!

Huge hit at Thanksgiving dinner.  I did saute the onions in the bacon drippings and substitute brown sugar for the white.  The in-laws were impressed and asked for the recipe.

I was looking for a quick and easy recipe for fresh green beans.  My family (husband and son) LOVED it.  I used a lot less bacon and bacon grease, and I sauteed my onions before putting them over the green beans as previously suggested and it worked wonderfully.  This is the dish I will be taking to the Easter gathering!

The best green beans ever! They were a hit at Thanksgiving. There was nothing for leftovers. I followed some of the suggestions and used very little sugar. Maybe a tablespoon of sugar. The beans were perfect! I thought the amount of vinegar in the recipe was perfect.

I made these for Thanksgiving and used fresh green beans. Everyone loved it, I used roasted almond slices too, I think next time I'll try walnuts. I will most likely make these again, they were a nice alternative to the usual green bean casserole.

I made this for a group and many of them said they liked it.  I would not make it again though by my tastes.  I wished I would have taken out half the grease, and decreased the amount of sugar.  Too sweet.

Loved these green beans and I'll definitely make them again.  I took the recommendation of a few other reviewers and halved the sugar, and I subbed in Stevia instead of regular sugar.  I also didn't have almonds so I subbed walnuts.  Tasted great. 

I let the mixture chill in the fridge for about 6 hours (instead of just 1 or overnight) and was happy with the flavor. 

The only drawback is the chilling time - this dish definitely isn't a last-minute quick dinner fix.  I really liked it though and will definitely make it again.

Love!  Made some of the changes that were suggested including crumbling the bacon and making it the night before.  It was a hit.  My entire family loved it.  I toasted the almonds separately and added they at the last minute.  They added a good crunch.

This was very good. I cut back the bacon to one slice per serving and used turkey bacon. It was plenty. I liked the tang of the vinegar with the bacon and sugar ..

I served this with Christmas dinner.  It tasted very good.  I did have concerns, though, about using so much bacon grease.  I don't think I'll serve this again since my conscience got the best of me for serving so much fat in a vegetable dish.

this was really good; I followed the directions exactly except I cooked the onion in the bacon grease.  Also it marinated for 2 nights but still turned out delicious. Will make again, thanks.

I am not a big cooked-veggie fan, but this was really wonderful! I tried it in the winter, and am looking forward to making it again this summer. Try this!! You'll love it and so will your family!

We loved this recipe but next  time I think I will only use  6 slices of bacon , I  dice my bacon before frying  and cook  onions in the bacon grease.  1/4 cup  of sugar.  ( 4 tbls)  Oh.. I used 2 pounds of Costco frozen beans.  I mix everything together  except almonds and put in casserole. Then top with almonds.I couldn’t stop eating them.

This was tasty and turned out pretty well.  My beans did not retain their green color though, unlike the picture posted with the recipe.  I think that having crisper, green beans would make it even better. Wondering if frying the onions, cooking the fresh beans and then dressing them with the warm marinade and foregoing the oven altogether would give a fresher result, while still capturing the flavor? I also used only 4 tablespoons sugar which still left them tasty.

made this for thanksgiving and it was great. I followed most of the recipe, and the recommended reviews, mixing the chopped onions with the vinegar and sugar then drizzling over bacon and Green beans.  next time I would probably cut down cook time by 15 minutes, as some of the Green beans were a bit dry with the full 45 minutes. I also cut bacon in cubes.

Just the type of green beans I like. In the future I will cut the bacon into smaller portions but it's great as shown. No specific onion was specified, so I used red onion as it was what I had on hand. Next time I will try a sweet onion like vidalia.

We loved these.  I made them for Christmas Day as an alternative to the usual green bean casserole with the Cream of Mushroom soup.  I swear I must have eaten half of the cake pan of these just at Christmas dinner and they were still just as tasty the next day.  My husband and son also raved about them.  I DID cut up my bacon into smaller pieces before frying it and then cooked the diced onion in the bacon drippings until transparent but followed the rest of the recipe to the letter.

I made these last year at Christmas. The flavor was a huge hit, but the "fresh" green beans were a little tough. At XMas time, North American Green beans are older and tougher, while the South American product hasn't come in yet. Sooooo. If you're cooking this at the holidays, I heartily recommend using a quality canned or frozen green bean. I used canned this year and cut back the cooking time to 35 minutes total. Absolutely NO negative comments this year. This will be my "go to" green bean recipe from now on.

Delicious. I used a bacon cooker to cook the bacon in the microwave. I followed other reviewers suggestion to cook the onion prior to baking. I used a tsp of the reserved bacon grease in a nonstick skillet. I layered the ingredients as stated. I warmed the vinegar and sugar in a glass measuring cup with about 1 tb. of the reserved grease. I let this marinate over night. Wow was it good and lower calories than the original. Thanks for the recipe.

I cut back the amount of sugar, omitted the onions and also followed the "quick" version another user suggested. LOVED THESE!!!
