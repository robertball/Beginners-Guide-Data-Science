I've had the chicken at the Belmont Tavern, and flipped when I saw this recipe - YUM!

However, a few tweaks - more garlic! :-) I didn't have time to marinate, so I lined the chicken up in a pan, poured some chicken broth in to cover the bottom, then lightly drizzled the chicken (I used legs) with olive oil.  I then put some crushed garlic on each piece, then sprinkled oregano (lightly), and grated Romano (generously) over all - I then drizzled the chicken (lightly) with Balsamic vinegar - Halfway through the cooking time, I turned the chicken, and repeated the application of garlic, oregano, romano, and balsamic vinegar, adding more chicken broth to cover the pan.  When the chicken was done cooking, it had a lovely dark brown sauce that I poured over the top of the chicken prior to serving.  Just like the Belmont!

This recipe is not bad, however, Balsamic Vinigar is not used....it is made with Red Wine Vinigar that has carmalized while cooking.  I know this because my friend is the head chef at Stretch's!

Adding more chicken recipes to my repetoire doesn't happen too often, as how many do you need?Well, Chicken Savoy is the exception to the rule.  My tweakings---I marinated the chicken all day in the oil,oregano, broth, 4 cloves crushed garlic, and 1/4 tsp. crushed pepper flakes.  Under each piece of marinating chicken, I tucked a few peeled cloves of garlic. I "cheesed" the chicken from the beginning, and really enjoyed the crispy golden coating.  Next time will experiment with the balsamic vinegar.  Did you know that you can boil this vinegar down to a syrupy glaze.  It becomes very sweet and thick.  Going to do that next time.
Thank you for sharing Joe, we really loved this dish.
Cheers,
Jeff
P.S.
3rd. time preparing this dish, and all of the above still goes---but, now I only use chicken thighs.  For each serving, I place 2 thighs on top of great mashed potatoes, and place a few whole garlic cloves in between the chicken pieces. I spoon some of the pan juices (not a lot though) around the edges of the mashed potato "bed". Lastly I drizzle the reduced "syrupy" balsamic vinegar on top.  WOW is all I can say.  Ummmmazing.  Thanks again, Joe

i just want to say....i WORKED at the belmont tavern back in the late 80's.....i actually prepared this this AT the belmont tavern. i see 2 things with this recipe that we NEVER did at the belmont: 1) we didnt use any chicken stock back then (not sure if they have changed it up since then but i doubt it) 2) RED WINE vinagar....not balsamic. A few additional tips: we would throw a whole teaspoon of the minced garlic/olive oil over EACH piece of chicken...as for the rest of the ingrediants...use them liberally (be careful with the salt obviously), this is supposed to be an intensely flavored dish. Make sure to use a metal roasting pan....it makes the caramalization a lot easier to attain than if you're using glass. lastly....be sure to add LOTS of red wine vinegar as soon as he chicken is taken out of the oven and then make sure to pour it all over the chicken after it has been plated.  i have made the authentic savoy at my house over the years......great dish.....unfortunately it never came out as good as it did at the belmont....im assuming the oven at the restaurant made the difference.   ps....this dish works best with a smaller sized chicken, IMO.

Recently there has been a lot of talk about this chicken recipe. I had it saved to my box and was anxious to try it. Last night was the night. With such simple ingredients, how could the reviews be so different from one another? This is what I did.  I used chicken breasts rather than the whole chicken because that's what I had on hand. In a dish, I drizzled the olive oil all over the chicken and made a rub of 3 minced garlic cloves, the oregano, salt and pepper. Rubbed that all over the chicken and carefully poured the stock over all. I let it sit for about 30 minutes to absorb the flavors. Then, in a heated cast iron skillet, I browned the herb crusted side for a few minutes til it had a nice brown. Turned it right side up, and poured the broth mixture over the top of the chicken. Coated the breasts with shaved parm/romano combo and baked it in the pan in a preheated 500 degree oven for about 20 minutes. Removed the breasts, added red wine vinegar instead of the balsamic, deglazed in the oven for 3 minutes and poured the finishing sauce on top of all. It was cooked perfectly and very moist and juicy. I served it with asparagus & angel hair pasta tossed with EVOO and garlic. 10 stars for taste, and 4 because I did not adhere to the actual directions. Will definitely make again.

Considering the few comments about this recipe being bland, I made some minor adjustments when I tried it.  First, I used a very rich chicken stock - home made, simmered and reduced until it was golden brown.  Second, I sprinked on a little basil along with the oragano.  And finally, I used several whole garlic cloves instead of the crushed garlic.  I served a garlic clove with each piece of chicken so my family could mash the garlic and spread a much or as little as they liked over their chicken.  I lowered the temp and baked it just a little longer to allow the flavors to meld just a bit more.  We LOVED this recipe!!!!

I LOVED IT.  ON MY DAY OFF I CUT UP THE CHICKEN AND PUT IT IN A ZIPLOCK WITH THE BROTH, GARLIC, OLIVE OIL AND OREGANO.  WHEN I GOT HOME FROM WORK I JUST POURED IT INTO THE PAN SPRINKELED ON THE CHEESE. NO MESS.  I THINK THAT IT ALSO MADE IT MORE TENDER TO MARINADE THIS WAY.

This is one of my favorite chicken dishes.  I've made it many times and everyone loves it.  I alter the recipe just a bit.  I marinate 8 boneless skinless breasts in about 1/3 cup balsamic vinegar, 1 Tbs olive oil, 8 cloves crushed garlic, oregano, salt and pepper.  I slice some mushrooms and saute them a little bit of balsamic vinegar and garlic.  I the cover the chicken breasts with the sauteed mushrooms and cheese, and then bake at 350 for about 40 minutes.

For those of you that haven't had the chance years ago to eat "Savoy made by Stretch" you really don't know what this dish is supposed to taste like. Stretch is "God of Savoy," and this recipe is close with a few exceptions. Years ago I was a regular and had to have Savoy at least twice a week. If I could have afforded it I would have been there for lunch and dinner every night. Then the worst thing happened- I was transfered to Nashville- Medegone Central where guys named Bubba made what they thought was pizza. I was in hell and had no choice but to try to make Savoy myself. I have now since moved back to NJ and perfected a home version which is a lot closer to Stretches than 40 or so other restaurants in North Jersey that currently have Savoy on their menu.  You will need metal pans cause glass will shatter when adding the cold balsamic vinegar at this high temp. Stretch must have had his oven up 700+ but you won't be able to do that. Start out around 375 for a half hour, then 400, then 450, and last 8 or so minutes 500+. Your goal is well done chicken, like a barbecue look.  Cooking time varies.. you want almost all of the stock to be cooked off before you take out and add balsamic vinegar which should be searing when applied. If not you had the heat too low. The Belmont is still the best but I think this is a very close second.

This is a meal worthy to serve to guests! If your looking for a new chicken recipe, this is certainly a worthy one to try.  The chicken is moist and so flavorful, even my three year old loved it.  The spices blend so well together, but they don't overpower the chicken and the cheese (I used what I had in the fridge, parmesan) added a wonderful touch.  The chicken came out of the oven looking beautiful.  My family of 6 all agrees that this is a keeper and I will certainly make when we have guest for dinner, and on our regular 'chicken' nights!  Also, a big plus is how easy it is to prepare this meal.  A lot of other chicken recipes take a lot of preparations and even require over night marinade, but this doesn't.  And you probablly have all the ingredients on hand already.  I served with rice pilaf and fresh green beans.

I marinated 8 boneless chicken breasts in 1/3 cup balsamic vinegar 8 cloves fresh garlic, the olive oil and the other spices, for about three hours.  I then baked them at 375 degrees for about 40 minutes. Added fresh sauteed mushrooms on top then the cheese.  Pretty tasty, and my husband loved it.

This is a very simple recipe but simply delicous.  Easy as pie to make but tastes very gourmet.  Your whole house will smell like a fancy restaurant while its cooking with the smell of garlic and olive oil roasting with parmesan. I love cooking and always look for more complicated recipes with the notion that the more that goes into it it ingredients and labor wise the more flavor you will have.  Im always looking for a new flavor fix.  A friend of mine turned me onto this recipe and uses boneless skinless for less fat.  I have made it twice now the same way (boneless skinless) and now this recipe has proved me very wrong on my old way of thinking.  WOW, its soo good!  The entire family loves it, its still good leftover too! Only thing I do different is use boneless skinless.  Add more garlic.  I start the cooking temp about 350 then graduate it to 425 half way thru. Then add more cheese and bring it to 500 for the last 15.   When its done and out of the oven I start to spoon the gravy in the bottom of the pan over it along with adding red wine vinegar.  I do this every couple minutes a few times till its cooled down enough to serve.  This helps it draw the flavors in bottom of the pan in along with the vinegar as it cools down with capilary action. Dont pass this recipe up! tonite we are trying it out with boneless skinless turkey breasts.  Im partial to turkey because its more flavorful than chicken.  I will report the verdict back.

This is a good chicken recipe.  The 450 degree oven scared me, and sort of blackened my cheese, so maybe next time I will try cooking at a lower temperature.  Other than that, this made the 3 of us happy at dinner last night.

Excellent! I drizzled a little vinegar over the chicken to cook with it, and intended to add more when done but I forgot to add it then. But the flavor was fantastic! I used red wine vinegar according to one of the reviews - I love balsamic but I wanted to try it as the original is made. That's the only change we made though.  We will definately have this again!

To be honest, the only thing I really liked was that the chicken was extremely moist...but that was it.  The husband and I didn't really care for this, although we did eat it.  I don't think that I will be making it again.  Thanks for the post, anyways.

You are right! It is the best! But unfortunately, as many people are confused about Stretch's recipe, he uses red wine vinegar and cooks it to a darker color and adds balsamic at the end for that famous sweetness that balsamic vinegar inherently possesses.

I followed intructions, but used only bone-in breasts. Only took 35 minutes, not 45 + to come to 160 degrees (I find letting it rest while we set the table etc. that it continues to cook and reaches 170 (as recommended for poultry here in the USA) and always results in moist and done chicken. The part of the skin that is out of the broth is very CRISPY which is appealing to some (I normally don't like to eat chicken skin;but DO enjoy it cooked this way), and the flavor was very good with the broth spooned over the chicken cut up. The crispy skin and the complex flavor in the broth are the stars here, although the chicken comes out moist, it is plain without the broth. Definitely a keeper, though. Easy and delicious! Thank you, Joe for this one!

Well, I've never eaten at the Belmont or even had Savoy before for that matter, so this review is of this recipe and how I, a home cook, like it, not how it compares to "the real thing."  I LOVED this dish!  It is easy, full of flavor and my house seriously smelled like an Italian restaurant while it was baking.  I used bone-in chicken breasts with the skin removed.  I marinated the chicken in all the ingredients (except for the cheese and vinegar) for about an hour.  I baked it for 15 minutes, then sprinkled on the cheese and baked for another 30 minutes.  The cheese was a nice golden brown.  I used balsamic vinegar (love) and about 4 cloves of garlic.  Otherwise, kept everything the same.  I will be making this again!

I made this the other night and had every intention of using the Red Wine vinegar which I read on several reviews. As destiny would have it I only had Balsamic on hand. LOVED it! So happy I stuck with the recipe! The only thing I did change SLIGHTLY was to add extra garlic. I used one large clove for every two pieces of chicken. Will definitely make again! thanks for a great recipe.

This is delicious. Even if you've had the real thing at the Belmont Tavern in Bloomfield, or Stretch's in Livingston NJ, it's probably as close as you're gonna get.  Without the vinegar it's just chicken, with the vinegar it's Savoy!  A forever keeper, thanks for unlocking the secret of an old fave. ............  EDIT 9-11-15.........made this again for the current man in my life and he said "make this again".  I was a little concerned that he wouldn't like the red wine vinegar taste but it met with his approval!  
thanks again.

can't believe I haven't reviewed this recipe, I've been using it for ages! 
I make mine slightly different, instead of using fresh herbs once i used Good Season packages sald dressing seasoning, WOW! A little good seasons seasoning mixed into the recipe added that extra zest i was looking for. Follow the recipe as it reads but add half or more of a package of good seasons salad dressing MIX to the oil broth mixture and see for yourself!

Joes's can be adapted with using a little less stock for most supermarket chicken and using a heavy iron or metal pan  with the pieces kept separated . Also,use a lot more salt,pepper,oregano than called for in Joe's recipe and cheese later on as other readers suggested AND use a good dose of plain old red vinegar though the balsamic is nice too .

PS Also use more garlic AND I have sneaked a peak in the Belmont kitchen( at risk of my life ) and plain red vinegar is used .

I made the Chicken Savoy.  It was really good and easy. I have had the "Belmont's" Chicken Savoy and this recipe is missing something.  It's not as tangy as the "Belmont's"  Any suggestions?

This is a very good quick chicken recipe.  It takes very little prep yet is tasty enough to serve to company.  I use basil instead of oregano in this recipe.  Great with salad and orzo side dish!

YUM YUM YUM! This was so simple to make, and the chicken was tender, juicy, and delicious! After reading previous reviews, I cut back on the oil. My husband just RAVED about this, he kept telling me, "This is a keeper!" And the house smelled wonderful! Thanks for such a nice one!

One of the biggest challenges with chicken breast is keeping it moist.  This recipe succeeds.  My husband called it excellent.  I marinated the chicken pieces in the oil, broth, spices and red wine vinegar (instead of basalmic) inside a ziploc bag while the chicken defrosted. Then I dumped it all in a corning ware baking dish with skin side down. Roasted at 450 degrees for 25 minutes, then flipped the chicken to be skin side up, sprinkled with parmesan cheese and reduced heat to 400 degrees.  Another 25 minutes and the chicken was perfect.  All liquid had dried up but chicken was tender and moist  (I am not sure where others got "gravy").  Delish! Will make again.

I was skeptical...after pouring on the vinegar at the end I was sure I had just ruined the whole thing...but it ended up working very well. I cooked it slowly using an old hen we had butchered. Very delicious!

Gosh, this one just didn't work for me.  We were not even close to a nice crispy crust.  Just chicken stewing in an oily vinegary broth.  I do not know where I went wrong, but I must have taken a left at Albuquerque.  Won't try again despite such glowing rewviews from others

Very solid recipe. The balsamic vinegar doesn't really add a crisp like the picture portrays, but there are probably ways to play with this (maybe cook a little beforehand, and then add a little at the end). I used boneless chicken breast, which cuts down the cooking time by half, and only cooked at 425 degrees since my oven tends to be hotter. Lastly, the more spice the better!

I really liked this. Easy, peasy, put it all together and throw it in the oven. I did use red wine vinegar, and funnily enough I will try balsamic next time. I cooked for about 50 minutes, it was just about to burn. All ovens are different though. May wait about 15 mins to put cheese on next time. I used chicken breasts. Not sure I would like it on whole skinned chicken parts. The flavor would be on just the skin.

It's hard to find a 2 to 3 pound whole chicken in my neck of the woods -- they're usually 4 to 5 pounds.  So, I used a package of 2.5 pounds of "split breasts" which worked wonderfully.  Except for the chicken pieces I followed the directions exactly.  A great recipe.  Very tasty mixture of ingredients and extremely easy.  I cooked it a little over 50 minutes and it was just slightly dry.  Next time I'll cook it 45 minutes and it should be perfect.  You won't go wrong with this one.

We LOVE this recipe.  Although very simple, it is a triumph in contrasts:  from the crispy coating, to the tender insides, to all those beautiful juices.  I love to serve this on a bed of raw or lightly-cooked bitter greens, which complement it beautifully.  (And although pasta makes a good side dish, a good dollop of creamy home-made mashed spuds is even more worthy, I reckon.)  My one vital piece of advice would be to use a GOOD Romano cheese, not that dandruffy stuff that comes in plastic packets.

This was delicious~!  It came out great! Juicy meat, and crispy skin.  Very easy to make.  I doubled all the spices, and be sure to add the oil LAST because once the oil touches the meat, it creates a blocking lining around the meat and the seasoning cannot get to it.  Also, I added the cheese last.  Thank you for the recipe!

I found the recipe and my husband (the real chef) made it and we LOVE it.  It is SO simple and yet the taste is almost elegant.  We are generous with the cheese on top and use italian seasonings instead of oregano, but stick to the original recipe other than that.  I have passed this recipe on to many friends who love it as well.

My husband(the human garbage disposal) ate three bites and pushed his plate away.  My children wouldn't even try it once they saw it.  I couldn't even think about it after smelling it cook.  Definetly will NOT be making this again.  If you don't like the taste of chicken fat try cooking it on a rack in the baking dish.

This is by no means the Belmount Taverns Chicken Savoy!!  I live around the corner from this tavern, and have frequented more times than I can remember.  First of all, Stretch's recipe is 'LOADED' with garlic, and red wine vinegar is used not balsamic.  Sorry, but this doesn't cut it.

We really liked it. No crazy flavors - just yummy comfort food. Likle others - I did make a few changes.  I upped the garlic (3 cloves, minced), subbed italian seasoning for oregano (heaping tsp), added to chicken broth and olive oil and marinated all day.  I kind of pulled the skin back on the pcs and smooshed them down into the marinade.  When it was time to cook I placed the chicken in the baking dish, smoothed back the skin and poured the marinade over the top. I cooked for 1 hour at 450, occasionally spooning the saauc eove rthe chicken.  I added the balsamic vinegar and sprinkled with parmesan 15 minutes before it came out. Chicken was flavorful and juicy with cripy skin. It makes a tasty, brothy, somewhat oily sauce that was delicious spooned over the chicken and the roasted potatoes I made as a side.  Will definitely make again.

just fair for me...I did add the extra spices.  Maybe I cooked it too long.  I just had 3 large chicken breasts (no bones and no skin)...I added a little flour to the gravy after cooking to thicken it up a little

I have been making this recipe for a couple of years and it is always great.  I do find that it is even better if you cook it a little longer to allow the chicken to get crispy on top, and I use parmesan cheese.  Do not omit the balsamic at the end or it is not real Chicken Savoy!  And by all means invest in a good quality balsamic for the best flavor, and POUR IT ON!!!

I used chicken breasts, marinaded them all day in a couple tbp. of oil, a couple tbp. of balsamic vinegar, sprinkled w/ garlic powder & italian saesoning. I subbed parmesan chesse for the romano & didn't add it until the chicken had already cooked for 20 minutes. I did reduce some balsamic & I enjoyed it on mine but my family said the chicken had plenty of flavor & didn't need it so they did not add it to their's. This came out crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside & flavorful through & through. I saved a couple of breasts to slice up & top a fresh salad w/ for dinner tomorrow...will let you know how it is.

This was ok. The chicken was moist and tender but rather bland (we tend to like lots of spice and flavor). Might make this again for the kids when the grownups are having something to spicy for them.

The kids and I enjoyed this dish. I used leg quarters instead of a whole chicken and it got gobbled right up. Its a keeper. :)

Very easy to prepare and the results were delicious. I added the cheese at about 1/2 hour cook time. I also cut the chicken just enough to have it lay flat in the dish and sliced it for servings after it was baked.

I will use this recipe again!

This recipe has a fairly good flavor...marinating before baking might help the flavor "stay" with the chicken - but all in all, this recipe is a keeper!

This recipe was pretty good.  The only thing I will change for next time is adding the cheese more towards the end.  Our cheese was a little "well done"!  I served this with linguine in a butter, cream, parsley, garlic sauce with romano cheese sprinkled on top....all the kids loved it.

This is a delicious recipe.  I made it with boneless breasts, as I was cooking for only two.  I think it will be even better with a whole chicken cut up.  I also added extra garlic and extra balsamic vinegar.

Made this dish last night.  Awesome is all we could say!   My husband and I  have had Chicken Savoy from Stretches Kitchen (the best in the world) but this recipe is a close match...and probably healthier too.   I will make and share this recipes many times in the future for sure.    Thanks for Posting!

Really awesome. I reduced the balsamic vinegar & drizzled it on the cooked chicken. Next time I'll marinate the chicken. All the flavor was in the crust.

I ama regular at the Belmont and will go there on Mondays to see some friends. When we can't get there or they have "run out of food" =Chicken with skin- a whole cut up - just not "skinny chicken" thighs drums split breasts-- the skin holds the flavors. I do marinate - I do use Red wine vinegar- this is not a fancy place - so fancy style is not authentic--
The secret is the cheese and the oregano and the vinegar at the end ...JUST DO IT

We were evenly divided on this.  The men thought it was just alright, the women really liked it.  I used blsl chix and homemade chicken stock.  Shaved Parmesan replaced the Romano cheese because I grabbed the wrong one (oops) I used red wine vinegar because I thought balsamic might overwhelm the other flavors.  The next time I will try that, though.  Thanks for another tasty recipe.

Great dish that was a big hit with the entire table! Per a previous suggestion, I used 4 cloves of garlic, used almost 1/4 c of olive oil and a dash of red pepper flakes. I also marinated the chicken for several hours before cooking it, which I did at 425 for 45 mins. I waited until 10 mins before the end of cooking to add the cheese.   Results: still a mild garlic flavor, but the balsamic vinegar really sets the dish. I will DEFINITELY be making this again. Thanks so much!

Altered slightly, using prev. reviews and my own likes. Used Good Seasons Zesty Ital. (dry) mix, 2 cloves crushed garlic, 1/4 tsp. poultry seasoning, 1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes, S&P, oregano, stock and oil. Marinate AT LEAST 2 HRS, OR OVERNIGHT.Double Romano!!! I made a reduction of balsamic with sugar to use as a dipping sauce, in addition to doubling the amt. of balsamic to finish it with. My son in the Army LOVED it, and took it to TX. to cook for his family today.  My DIL told me it was AWESOME. What better praise?

WOW! I have sampled many recipes in the past cpl years that I've used Allrecipes, and this is by far one of the best. And oh, SO easy! I followed some reviewers' tips and doubled the spices (used Italian seasoning instead of oregano). Used minced garlic and a LOT of it - a few Tbls. Had three large bone-in split chicken breasts & removed skin. Next time I will marinate the chicken for a few hours and cut back on cook time like other reviewers. Cooked 45 min @ 450 degrees and it came out deliciously moist, but the temp was in 180's so it was on verge of being overdone... will cook next time til 150+ and let it sit few min til done. Used Kraft's parm/asiago/romano cheese b/c that's what was on hand... it turned out BEAUTIFUL and was delicious! Made the house smell delicious too! Oh, and the balsamic vinegar makes it! YUM! Husband raved about it, and kids loved it too, so it has made it to our routine meal list!

I was in the mood for a mellow baked chicken dinner & this one hit the spot. I followed the recipe pretty closely.  I measured the oil & stock but I just sprinkled garlic powder, oregano, salt & pepper & then the cheese.  I didn't measure the seasonings.. Just put a lot on.  It was a tasty baked chicken.  My husband & kids liked it.  I only had 1 piece leftover.  I would make this again  because it's so simple.

Yum - So simple and so delicious! I only like white meat so I cut pieces of split breast in half. I only give 5 stars when everybody loves something (which is so rare in my house). Thanks for posting the recipe.

Chicken Savoy with Hot or Sweet Cherry Peppers... follow the regular recipe but just add more Garlic and also add Hot or Sweet Cherry Peppers... you can also do a little mix of both Hot & Sweet... I like to also de-stem and de-seed the Cheery Peppers under running water while tearing the Peppers in half or thirds... you can also first but not nessecaryly roll the Chicken in Olive Oil an Pan Searing the Chicken on each side in a Cast Iron Pan/Skillet on the Stove for few minutes to lock in the Juices and then put the Chicken in high sidded Thick Baking Pan in the Oven and Bake for another 30 to 40 minutes... while Baking you can Flash it with a little White Wine "which I like to do"... and remember to Flash the Chicken with Balsamic Vinegar at the end about Five minutes before taking Chicken out of the Oven... ps some people like it better without the Cheese... if you do add Cheese use fresh grated Parmesan or Reggiano Cheese to sprinkle on top right before serving... the Combination of the Olive Oil, Oregano, Cherry Peppers and Balsmic Vinegar give the Chicken an out standing flavor!... have plenty of Bloomfield Ave French Bread Baguettes cut into small pieces on hand for dipping in the Juices... Yum!... Cheers All!

WOW---! This recip[e is so great. We cut in half and used 2 breasts on the bone w/ skin. 
I milled everything (garlic, cheese, oregano, salt,pepper) together and stuffed under the skin as well as on top which made the chicken FANTASTIC!!
The balsamic is the best part!

Outstanding!  Who would've thought a recipe so simple can taste so wonderful?  I made my own stock, added more garlic and red pepper flakes and blended them.  Let the chicken marinade in the fridge for 6 hrs and baked it at 400 degrees for 45 mins, served it over rice with veggies; got rave reviews!  The vinegar was not even needed, I actually thought it made it taste worse.  Thanks for sharing!

this was good! I had to use chicken thighs and I topped them on slow cooker mashed potatoes (also on this site) and it was quite yummy. I marinated them in mixture all day as suggested and used fresh sage also. Next time I will try the whole chicken cut up into pieces. Thanks for the yummy recipe.

This is one of the best chicken recipes I have ever tried.  I put a whole cut up chicken into the mixture and marinated for about an hour then baked it.  Absolutely full of flavour.  Big thumbs up.

I thought that this was wonderful!  Good flavor, good texture and not too high in fat (you don't even need to use the oil if you're trying to cut back on fat).  Served with gilled asperagus topped with the same cheese - yummy!

This was something different than the normal chicken and so easy to make.  The chicken is very moist and mouth watering.  Everyone in my family loved it and I would definitely make it for company.  Thanks for sharing this!

I have always wanted to make chicken like this!  The combination of 
ingredients is superb.  I used a 4 lb chicken so I doubled the ingredients
and baked it for 60 minutes, it was perfect.  Thanks for sharing this one Joe, 
it is already in my permanent collection.

Very good - I used boneless breasts, don't overcook.

Rather than use a whole chicken, I was lazy and used 2 lbs of boneless chicken thighs. I otherwise followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfectly.

I made it and I'll do so again. I used skinless breasts so cooking time was only 30 minutes. Romano is not easy to come by where I live and I had no mozzarella so I used Parmesan and Gouda instead. Came out super.  Nice and tender. This is really a great base recipe you can change around to suit your mood. By substituting cheeses and using flavored oils or vinegar you can give this dish some more flair.

This is delicious!  I used a lot more garlic (an entire bulb), Gruyere cheese (that's what I had on hand), and finished the dish with red wine vinegar (instead of balsamic, as many raters suggested).  It was fabulous.  The family loved it too.  Definitely adding this to my regular rotation of chicken dishes.

I was worried this may be a little bland or that the cheese would burn. WRONG!  It was delicious and so easy.  I did use my dutch  oven instead of a glass baking dish - I'm not sure if that made any difference.  I used 3 of the little frozen squares of garlic from my Trader Joe's package I keep in the freezer.  I let it marinate for 1 hr before cooking.  It turned out perfect and the cheese made a perfect golden brown crust on the chicken. I will be making this often.

Delicious! I marinated a cut-up whole chicken overnight. Next time I will add more vinegar. As others suggested, I added about 3-4 more garlic cloves. I waited til near the end to add the cheese. Also, I cooked it for about 1 1/2 hours. Added several quartered potatoes; Soaked up some of the chicken grease and reminded me of Greek broasted potatoes.  Will definitely make this again. Easy recipe.

Simple and delicious. My husband especially enjoyed it. I made it exactly as the recipe stated but added one more  clove of garlic chopped and the  dried oregano came from my garden. Will definitely make again and do recommend it. Thanks for this easy recipe.

Made this recipe almost completely to the letter, but since I did not have access to Romano cheese in the country I come from, I used a different kind of cheese. The taste was good, but not great, possibly due to the different cheese. The chicken itself was nice and juicy, and the balsemic vinegar was tasting good.

I actually made a "paste" by pureeing the olive oil, dried herbs and cheese and spread it on top of the chicken (skin-side) after browning it in a cast-iron skillet.  After baking, I drained off the excess olive oil.  Then, mixed the skillet drippings with red wine vinegar (not balsamic), reduced a bit, and spooned over baked chicken. I usually don't even eat dark meat, but this was absolutely delish!  ;-)

Made this again last night, adding Italian Dressing mix and substituting Italian seasoning for the oregano. I also sprinkled with GOOD balsamic vinegar before baking, then adding more before serving. SO good!

I really wanted to love this recipe, but didn't.  I followed the recipe, but did use the red wine vinegar as suggested by others, but only because we'd had filets with balsamic glaze a few nights before.  The romano topping was tasty and did crisp up nicely, but I didn't get the rich color I had hoped for.  I thought the chicken itself was rather bland.

We thought this was okay.  The chicken didn't seem to soak up a lot of the flavor, but it was good if you poured some of the sauce on it.

This was great! Amazingly simple, and my husband loved it. He doesn't typically care for eating meat off the bone, but loved the flavor. I took some of the suggestions I found from other reviewers. Used extra garlic (we're big fans) and put a little on each piece of chicken. I also used red wine vinegar instead of balsamic - poured it over the chicken about 15 minutes before it was time to take it out. Skin was crispy and the dish had a subtle but pleasant flavor; and the house smelled wonderful! Will definitely make again and have passed it on to several friends.

This was ok.  Not fabulous but my kids liked it.  One recommendation was to use red wine vinegar instead of balsamic.  I think I will try that next time.  The cheese got too black, I would add it closer to the end.

This was sooo good.  We took another reviews suggestion and put half of the chicken stock in the pan, added the chicken (we used boneless, skinless breast), seasoned it with extra everything, plus a dash of red pepper flake, and the balsamic.  Halfway through cooking, we flipped the chicken and added the rest of the chicken stock, more seasoning, and MORE garlic, and red pepper and balsamic.  The result was spectacular!  The sauce leftover was thin, but super-tasty!  Thanks for a new recipe that we will use again and again!

Delicious! I added more seasoning than called for and also marinated it in the mixture for an hour prior to baking.
Worked wonderful with chicken breasts. I have made this twice in one month!

If there were 4.5 stars, that's what I would rate it. Let's just say it has potential. I will make it again but will not use chicken stock or at least use only about a half cup. It was just too much liquid. I ended up thickening some of the broth and made a side of gravy for those who did not want bals. vinegar. I also added basil and doubled the garlic. Thanks.

I really don't know what went wrong with this recipe, I read all the reviews and almost everybody said that it was a very good chicken. DH and I ate it, but he said he didn't like it at all, my kids wouldn't come near the chicken because it didn't look too good. I don't think I'll make the recipe again. Sorry.

WOW! That was my husband's reaction to this dish---he said he could eat it 4 nights a week!  All 3 kids loved it too--this one is a definite keeper.  I used frozen chicken breasts that I cooked for about 25 minutes, then added the broth, olive oil and fresh garlic.  Seasoned the chicken and used fresh Parmesan to finish cooking the chicken, then broiled a couple of minutes on low to brown the cheese....YUMMY!!  I was hesitant to add the balsamic, but I tried it and it was fabulous...even the kids wanted it on theirs and it got thumbs up all around.  We'll be making this frequently..thanks for sharing!

This recipe was very good.  Because of the low carb diet I am on, I used boneless, skinless chicken breast and used a little less chicken broth.  Halfway through the cooking time I sprinkled some more cheese on the chicken and it was sooooooo good!  Thanks!

What a delicious dish! I added 5 cloves of garlic,used italian seasoning and 1/2 cup of grated italian blend cheese. Also made sauce thick by adding a little cornstarch mixed with cold water after adding vinegar. Will lower oven temp to 375 to allow chicken to be a little more tender. Served w/ butter pasta and sauteed broccoli.  YUMMO!!!!!

This was okay, but nothing really special.  I found just sprinkling the crushed garlic on the chicken left it quite garlic, because you couldn't even it out.  If I make it again, I'll try sprinkling a bit of garlic powder on top.

FOOLPROOF.  Significantly modified by a non-chef based on available ingredients and spices and using only chicken legs, this dish was a well-received departure from my routine.  Combined with oven roasted potatoes in the same pan, the skin and potatoes had a nice crisp and the meat was tender and juicy.  Thanks.

Very simple and very good.  Made it with and without chicken skins- both came out good, although one was obviously less healthy.

My husband keeps asking me where I'm getting all these wonderful recipes! This dish was wonderful. So juicy and tender. I used boneless, skinless thighs, about 2 lbs worth and I added more romano and balsamic. I was out of orengano so I used thyme instead. I'll be making this for years to come. Thanks!

This was excellent.  I thought the chicken might end up being too dry, but it came out wonderfully moist, and the skin is TO DIE FOR!  I used a half-cup of grated fresh Parmesan instead of Romano, since that's what I had on hand.  Very good flavor - I can't wait to eat the leftovers today!  Thanks for the recipe, Joe!

This is an important step to this recipe.Cooking meat at a high temperature won't dry out the chicken using the following:Brine the raw meat in a solution of approx 1/2 gallon of water with 1/2 cup each of kosher salt & sugar thoroughly dissolved in it. Add the meat and let this brine for at least 6 hours or overnight in the fridge.Rinse the meat off under the faucet, dry it with paper towels.

I norbally have bad luck baking chicken because the meat dries out. Well no more! My first batch I used chicken legs. I also marinated for a day prior to baking. You may want to omit the salt being the cheese has salt in it as well. Other than that this was very easy to make and yummy. My husband liked this dish and even licked his plate!

Wow! This is now one of my favorite dishes. Following suggestions of other reviewers, I marinated the chicken in broth, oil, garlic, and onion powder. I added whole garlic cloves to the dish and squeezed the roasted garlic into the juice when the dish was done. I cooked it for 45 minutes basting frequently. And I added the cheese from the start and really liked the crispy coating. Be sure to serve with a lot of the juice. This one really is worth licking your fingers to get ever last drop! Thanks for the yummy recipe.

I used a bag of select pieces with skin removed and freshly shredded Parmesan cheese.  I didn't serve the chicken with the balsamic vinegar because I didn't have any on hand.  Husband said it was a keeper and picky 11-yr old enjoyed dinner.  Will add to recipe file.

This was ok, but rather bland. Maybe marinating the chicken overnight in the spices, stock and oil might help (as suggested by others). Probably wouldn't make this again without significant changes to the recipe.

This recipe was excellent! My husband loved it. I used split chicken breasts on the bone. I took the tips on marinating the night before, using rich stock, adding the cheese halfway through cooking and adding extra whole garlic cloves. I also realized I only had it on 350 degrees after 30 minutes, so I increased to the 450 and it cooked a total on 90 minutes.  It was perfect and juicy!

Don't really think I did anything wrong...just added extra garlic, but no one ate this and I ended up throwing it out...I was skeptical anyway...I probably just have different tastes then the rest of the population.  Thanks anyway for the recipe!

My husband usually does not like chicken, but really liked this!  I didn't have balsamic vinegar, so just ate the chicken prepped as directed sans vinegar!  The chicken was perfectly tender and this really reheats well!

I have nothing but compliments for this recipe.  I never heard of Chicken Savoy until a friend mentioned it. Now it will remain in my cookbook forever. It was very easy to prepare and all the ingredients complimented each other for a wonderful taste.  I served it with Farfalle done in garlic and oil topped with grated cheese. What a treat!

I was looking for a new chicken recipe and this is a keeper. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and omitted the olive oil. Trying to keep it on the low fat side. The flavor was excellent and my 7 and 10 year old loved it. Thanks Joe

I love chicken and am always trying new recipes.  Made this last night and while my house smelled so good while it was cooking, I wasn't that  impressed with the actual taste.  Had a lot of juices left over which were too oily to eat.  Would skip the olive oil next time.

A very simple and good recipe.  My 21/2 year old really enjoyed it.  I used skinless/boneless chicken breast and it was out-of-this-world good.(I added a little more garlic,olive oil, and cheese than the recipe called for.)

I was a little skeptical when I looked at the ingredients list, however I was swayed by the reviews and decided to try it. 
What a delicious recipe!!!  The flavours were well matched and really quick to make.  I used boneless/skinless chicken breasts but other than that followed the recipe, watching to make sure that I didn't overcook the chicken.  Served it with Rice sauted with onions and mushroom and some extra cheese.  Yummy!!!

I had no idea what to make for dinner the other night and found this great recipe!  It is so easy, tastes great and is great served with plain white rice.

This tastes just like the chicken at an old Italian place in Chicago...think it was called Armando's.  I have been craving it for years! So easy to whip up, and just plain succulent! I did cover it to roast, however.  Thanks, Joe!

What a great dish!  I also used about 10 cloves of garlic, added some rosemary and paprika, and used Parmesan cheese.  
Know what?  It was great!  Cooked this for the first time for guests and almost nothing was left.  Very good served with 
lingunini tossed with olive oil, garlic, and parsley.  This is staying in my cookbook!

I ADDED 10 CLOVES OF GARLIC ( EMERIL HERE I COME)WHITE WINE AND MUSHROOMS FOR MORE FLAVOR AND ALSO AT THE END I ADDED MUCH MORE BALSAMIC THEN IT CALLED FOR. I GUESS IT IS A MATTER OF TASTE. BUT THIS RECIPE WAS A GREAT GUIDE AND IT WAS YUMMY!!!!

So easy and so flavorful!  After it baked for an hour at 459, I dropped the temp to 350 and left it in the oven while I made rice and broccoli (because timing all components of a meal isn’t exactly my forte).  It STILL came out juicy and flavorful!  PERFECT for a company din ent since you can put the chicken on a platter.

Everyone ate it. Nobody complained, but nobody raved either. I thought it was good, but not outstanding. Made exactly as directed, but used bone-in, skin-on thighs.

It was very good. However the top of the chicken got a little burned so I put aluminum foil over it the last 10 minutes. The recipe did not say that it should be covered while baking.   Will definitely make it again with that in mind.

I added a bit more garlic, since I don't use salt, except celery salt for less sodium. I did however drizzle lightly with honey and ginger juice. It turned out Exceptional, the flavors were out of this world. I'm glad I added and subtracted some of the original ingredients. I also made mushroom risotto with this dish. The asparagus lightly with a 1/3 squeeze with lemon 1/2 tbsp of olive oil. I'm a natural cook, no recipe to follow. Exquisite!

I used red wine vinegar, lots more garlic. It was easy to prepare and I think worth making again with a few tweaks. We found the chicken to be a bit dry, so I would maybe try baking at a lower temp for longer and finishing up at 500 degrees.

My husband loved this the first time I made it and he is not a chicken fan.  I used chicken breast and Parmesan because that is what I had on hand.  The second time I used chicken thighs and we didn't like it as much.  Will make this one again.

I made this according to directions, not sure if it came out right, but the result is pretty good. I used red wine vinegar but I don't get this "thickening" people are talking about, since there wasn't much sauce to thicken. I think the problem is with the cooking time. 45-60 minutes at 450F is way too long. My Thermopen says the breasts were 180F after 45 minutes. Weird since it doesn't taste overcooked, and the chicken is fairly moist and flavorful.

I have had Chicken Savoy at Stretches, and although their dish can NEVER be duplicated, this recipe is pretty darn good.  Some changes I made are while cooking I turned the chicken over every 15 minutes and poured balsamic AND red wine vinegar over each piece.  This really gives the chicken that extra boost of flavor.  My family loves this meal.

I'm glad I read the reviews.  I didn't have red vinegar though so I did use the balsamic.  And I did add some white wine to the chicken stock, just because I can. Either way I would recommend using more vinegar then what the recipe calls for.  Over all it was a good simple dish and I will make it again.

Made it exactly as the recipe said. It was dry (should I have covered when cooking? That wasn't mentioned in the recipe). It wasn't very flavourful. Should probably have marinated it. Not something I will make again.

The only thing I changed was to marinate overnight in the refrigerator  as was stated by other reviewer‘s. I enjoyed this recipe but I didn’t have as much flavor as I was expecting can I have so many chicken recipes that I would probably rather have.

I used all boneless, skinless thighs, and it was incredible.  My husband, who is not the biggest fan of chicken, loved it and finished off all of the leftovers.  He said it was even better the next day.

So good! I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and adjusted the time accordingly. Staple ingredients put together in a new, refreshing way!

This was delicious!! I have to say that I had low expectations because the ingredients didn't seem like they go together, but I was wowed! Seriously good. The only change I made was using red wine vinegar instead of balsamic vinegar, per suggestions of people who worked at Belmont Tavern. I will definitely make this dish again, and it was so easy. Thanks, Joe!

I used a light seasoning rub on the chicken and then followed the recipe as written. Turned out well, be generous with the balsamic vinegar!

This was not that great for us.  Even though I followed the recipe, I felt I must have missed an ingredient or a step. (Is the chicken suppose to marinate before cooking?)  We look at new recipes as "keeper" if we like them, and we all decided this one was NOT a keeper.  I would appreciate any comments correcting any errors I may have made.

It was easy and tasty.  I used Parmesan instead (because it's what I have on hand) and ate it with a side of spaghetti.  I will absolutely make it again.

This recipe is quick, easy, and tasty, however I would add the balsamic vinegar halfway through cooking  rather than at the end.

Soooo good. I used 2 large boneless, skinless chicken breasts. I used the exact amounts as the recipe with cooking cherry in lieu of balsamic. I also put 1 tsp of minced garlic on each breast. Outstanding!

I went with a rendition posted by another user - using 8 boneless chicken breasts, cooking at 350 for 40 minutes with the balsamic in the cooking sauce rather than added later. I also used broth instead of stock as that's what I had readily available. I thought it was a tad bland - maybe I'd add some onion powder or turn the leftover sauce into a glaze?

Loved this.  Did as a couple of reviewers suggested and put the chicken pieces (just thighs) in the broth, oil, s&p, oregano and a tablespoon of minced garlic for about 4 hours then put it all in the pan and topped with romano cheese.  I reduced the balsamic vinegar so it was a syrup and drizzled it over cooked pieces.  The marinade permeated the chicken and was so good...served over rice.

This dish was very easy to make.
I did not have Romano cheese so I substituted Parmesan cheese.  The Balsamic  vinegar gave it a real boost in taste.
It was tasty and the whole family enjoyed it.

It was a very good recipe, but 50-60 minutes at 450 degrees is too hot and too long for chicken.  I used average thickness chicken breasts and they would have been done after 40 minutes with oven turned down to 400.

Was easy to do I pre-booked mine so I could have fresh broth . Did it all the same way but that and only cooked for 30mins. I also removed skin after boiling to make it healthier. Hope you like it, I did. ??

I made this recipe several times..  and suggest these modifications.

use 9x13 glass dish, 450 convection/bake  -- 45 min to 1hr.
4 medium legs and thigh's  
1/2 cup chicken broth
1/4 cup red wine vinegar 
parsley to garnish

directions
put chicken (w/ or w/o skin) in dish
pour  broth, & red vinegar & olive oil over chicken
add 1 tbsp garlic on top of chicken
bake 45 min  to 1 hr at 450 degrees (convection if you have it) till Done (this means brown, almost over done)

baste chicken 
sprinkle cheese over the top and broil for 5-10 min (should look very done). Remove from oven.

This was great!!  I didn't have all the spices needed, I used garlic, peppercorn, and Italian season with vegetable oil.  Topped with shredded pepper jack cheese and drizzled with balsamic vinegar when done.

I seasoned the chicken the night before to "marinate".  Omitted the olive oil and balsamic vinegar; still had great flavor!!

I liked it fine, but wasn't "wowed."  My husband - food snob - seemed to react the same way.  My kids liked it much more, but they're kids.  I made the recipe as-is, except I used only thighs and I used Parm instead of Romano cheese.  I also cut slits in the meat to help penetrate.  I felt like the spices should go on before the oil and stock, but I like to try recipes as-is before making changes.  Next time I'll try it "my way" and see if the flavor penetrates more.  Also, I didn't really notice the balsamic vinegar, so maybe I'll pour it over each individual portion as serving next time, instead of over the entire thing before serving (seemed to just run off into the baking dish).  On the whole, the flavors were nice and I'll make again, but changes will be tried.

Humm, this was just OK. I really didn't think it had all that much flavor. I was expecting a flavor burst of some kind by reading the reviews. The chicken did come out moist, but I thought it was lacking something. Sorry, I really tried to like this but,I probably won't make this again.

Wow! I made this last night and absolutely loved it. I used boneless chicken breasts and also added basil like someone else suggested, as well using LOTS of garlic. My boyfriend loved this dish; we will definitely be having it again soon!

I thought the recipe was great. I love the way the dish smells while its cooking. I chose to use chicken breast and look forward to trying it on a whole chicken very soon.

yummy chicken!  my family loved it... the kids didn't want the balsamic vinegar, but my husband and I did... i used a lot more garlic... and i seasoned the heck out of the top of those breasts with the oregano, salt, pepper... and I used a basil/garlic blend and parmesan cheese instead of ramano.  i put the chicken in the oven half frozen and cooked at 450 for about 50 minutes and it was perfect... served with alfredo spirals and broccoli .... yummy!

Excellent flavor.  I used 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts and I would suggest cooking it only 20-25 minutes so it won't dry out.  As far as ingredients, I wouldn't change a thing.  My husband and I both loved it!  thank you.

Nothing out of the ordinary, but still good. If I make this again, I will reduce the balsamic to a syrup and marinate longer.

I was a little bit disappointed with this one, especially after reading all the glowing reviews.  It wasn't that it was bad, simply boring and without flavor.  It may be because I used skinless breasts instead of a whole chicken, but all the spices and flavor just seemed to slide right off of it.  It wasn't a bad dinner, but not one I would make again.

I prepared this recipe exactly as written.  The chicken was ok but he flavors didn't seem to go together very well.  I do have a recipe for chicken that used balsamic vinegar and garlic and I was trying to figure out what the difference was with this recipe. I like my other recipe much better.  Maybe the cheese?  I'm really not sure but I won't make this again.  It was very easy and quick to prepare but like I wrote before, the flavors weren't melding nicely.
Tried this one again and it was a bit better with the tips from the "most helpful" reviewers but still not great or different.  Tastes like chicken marinated in Italian salad dressing.

This was okay, but I would not make it again.  From all the reviews, I thought it would be great, but my husband and I were disappointed.  I don't think it was too overpowering as some of the reviews had stated, but it just didn't strike me as anything spectacular.

What a hit!  I made this for company...they loved it and everyone wanted seconds...even the 7 year old!  I did not have Romano on hand, so I grated fresh Parmesan cheese.  I added the cheese at the end..I was afraid it would burn.  I baked it in my convection oven @400 degrees and it had a great crispy outside with a juicy inside.  I will use this for my Cooking Club group!  Thanks!!

This didn't turn out how I thought it would. There wasn't a lot of flavour and the cheese didn't go crispy like other reviewers said it would. The vinegar on top at the end was the best part. I doubled the amount to inject some extra flavour.

Wonderful!  We all loved this chicken.  I used boneless chicken breasts and added the vinegar about 10-15 minutes before taking it out of the oven.  This added a little extra flavor.  My 3 year old kept saying "this is great chicken, mom" and that is very rare.  Quick and great tasting-what more could you ask for?

Really simple (which I love).  I skipped oregano and put on a touch of sage. Cheese really "crisped" the skin.  Family loved it.

Superb!  It came out crisp on the outside and juicy inside!  I used 2 tbsp balsamic and 1 red for the vinegars and fresh grated parmesan instead of romano.  I did not have a large enough pan so I stacked the chicken and rotated it as it crisped on top. This worked well!

This was good, but not as fabulous as I expected it to be.  I used canned chicken broth, which may have something to do with it, but making homemade chicken stock is a little more work than I am willing to do!  I would make this again but would put the balsalmic vinegar in before cooking, not after, and marinate for at least a couple hours before baking.  I would definitely shorten the time or lower the temp too - I baked it at 450 degrees for 45 min, and it was slightly dry.

450 degrees is way too high for this dish! I knew better but wanted to follow the recipe. I baked the chicken for 45 minutes and it turned out dry. I reduced the balsamic vinegar and loved it but hubby didn't. This also made the house smell funny because of the melting cheese. I will probably make a variation of this again but it will be at 350 for an hour without the balsamic vinegar. This can be a guide recipe for something special.

Simply delicious!!! My husband went nuts over it!! I marinated it since the night before and used 3 cloves minced garlic. Also added 4 whole cloves to cook with the chicken and mashed it at the end into the sauce. It was very, very good!

Yummy. I took the advice and marinaded the chicken in the oil and chicken broth in a Ziploc bag for several hours before cooking. The cheese part wasn't the best, however, and I may leave that off next time, or at least put it on later in the baking time. I liked the balsamic vinegar on it, but my husband just ate his plain. Served it with "Suzy's Mashed Red Potatoes", recipe also from this site. Will probably make again. Was better the next day.

I thought this recipe was great, but my husband was not too crazy about it.  We however did not use the balsamic vinegar on top, maybe that is why he did not like it.  I suggested it, but he gave me a firm no.  I will try it again one more time.  I enjoyed it though and so did my 2 year old son.

My husband does not like chicken with bones but ate this for Sunday dinner, watching the game that night and the next day for lunch.  He loved it.  I did follow some of the tips and marinate it the night before.  It was juicy and flavorful.

This was great!  I added the cheese at the end and also added artichokes for fun.  Many reviewers left out the vinegar,  I say don't do it,   it isn't bland when you add balsamic vinegar!  They entire family gave it thumbs up,  from a five year old to thirteen year old,  that doesn't happen often. I added this my recipes!

This was OK.  I used a parmesan-romano combo cheese, which I had in the house.  In my oven, 45 minutes of cooking at 450 degrees was even a bit long as the chicken was just a litle dry.  I put the balsamic vinegar on the table so my family could pour some over a little of the chicken to see whether they liked the taste or not.  I liked it better without the addition of the vinegar.

This recipe is so simple to prepare, and SO delicious!  It has already become a staple at our house; we make it every couple of weeks.  The balsamic vinegar gives it that little bit of extra "punch".  What a treat!

This was good.  I generally followed the reviewers' advice.  I used chicken breasts, cooked it for 20 mins per side, bumped the garlic to 5 cloves, added cheese and balsamic vinegar to each side when turned.  The cheese and vinegar made a nice crust.  I sliced grape tomatos in half and added them halfway through with more stock.  Next time I'd like marinate the chicken, but it was plenty good.  Use good chicken and stock.  I served it with wilted spinach and whole wheat penne.

I loved this chicken, and so did my kids. My daughter asked for seconds on this one. I especially loved the cold leftovers the next day. Very flavorful and a bit zingy! Yum!

This was so quick and easy to prepare! How could it possibly taste so good? But it did.  My husband loved this one... GREAT flavor and the meat was very moist.  definitely a keeper!

My husband loves chicken any kind-tried this he really enjoyed it.  I used boneless chicken breast, they were very good.  Used the leftovers the next night in a salad, very good this way also.  S.Bradley

Very good recipe. Next time I'd probably remove the skin and add onions to zest it up a bit.

Five stars and rave reviews for this chicken recipe.  My daughter pronouned it "restaurant quality" -- high praise from a girl with a selective palate!  I used chicken breasts only and served with cheese ziti as recommended.  Superb.

I was a little skeptical about this recipe, but was I wrong!  This was so simple, and so great!  There were no leftovers which is too bad because it would have been probably better the next day!

Simple, delicious, and smells wonderful cooking.  Prep time is very short.  I added extra garlic and balasmic vinegar.  I'll definately cook this one regularly.

A great recipe. Will melt in your mouth, but I think the recipe calls for too much chicken. I had tons of leftovers, and this dish is not all that great when reheated.

This recipe was nothing short of terrific.  It doens't sound very appealing, but it tastes great and is very easy to make.  My 6 year old son wanted to make sure we had leftovers so he could eat more the next day...Another keeper!

This was incredibly moist and delicious.  I didn't have the romano cheese and it was still amazing.
