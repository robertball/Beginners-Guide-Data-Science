I thought this was great! Served with fresh strawberries and Nilla wafer cookies. My guests loved it! Didn't change a thing either - made recipe as written.

I made this with my oldest boy yesterday as a fruit dip for our New Year's Eve snacking.....I wanted to pretend that we were kind of eating healthy. ;) This was really inexpensive to make because I found the margarita mix at Grocery Outlet and everything else was either on sale for cheap or I had it already in my pantry. I made my own fresh squeezed orange juice and I used Cool Whip for the whipped cream. I also used reduced fat cream cheese and light whipped topping. We loved this, even my husband! We ate sliced organic apples, chunk pineapple, Cutie slices and whole strawberries with this. Next time, I might add some lime zest to this, but that's a personal choice.

Made this on Saturday and really liked it.  I didn't mix it long enough before adding whipped cream so make sure you mix it well.  I served it with nila wafers and pretzels.  It wasn't overly sweet so I don't know why people said that.  Will definitely make it again.  Thanks for sharing!

I  served this at a taco bar I planned for work.  I didn't realize I didn't have any orange juice so I added 1T of orange liqueur plus a bit of lime juice and zest to brighten up the flavor, then I folded in 1/2 an 8oz container of cool-whip and served with strawberry halves.  The dip was light and fluffy with great flavor and not too sweet at all.

I made this for he first time yesterday and it was a huge hit! Served with pineapple, strawberries, watermelon and vanilla wafers (wafers were the first to go). Next time I'd like to try and thicken it up, it was a little drippy.

I made this for my husband's office party and it was a HUGE hit. Everyone liked that we had something a little different for their "dip" party since everyone else brought more savory items. We served it with pound cake cut into sticks and graham cracker sticks. I might try strawberry margarita mix next time for a twist!
