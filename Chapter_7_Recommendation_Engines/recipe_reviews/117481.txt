I honestly don't know if I like it or not. It's very peculiar tasting. Not bad exactly but not really good either. It's like the tea and ginger flavors cancel each other out. I appreciate the creativity though. :o)

I love ginger anything, so this recipe got my attention.  Didn't care for it much, but thanks for sharing.

I tried this as well only with southern sweet tea freshly brewed and a squeeze of my own lemon slice (since my daughters don't like lemon in their tea) yes I agree..really awesome drink and it's better than a Long Island iced tea! :-)
