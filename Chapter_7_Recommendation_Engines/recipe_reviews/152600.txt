Easy to make, but not as spectacular as I would have wished. I also used honeydew melon, canteloupe, and blueberries, but no kiwi, to make it easier for people to eat. The cheese had a tendency to crumble after a short while.

I've made this several times now due to popular demand.  It's easy to eat, healthy, refreshing on a hot day, and it looks fabulous.  A great dish to bring for an outing.  Didn't take much time to make because of the easy clean-up (a cutting board and knife).

My 4 yr old had a great time making these! We used different cheese and fruit and put them on toothpicks (we just used what we had on hand). That's the great thing, you can use whatever suits you. Ours had sliced string cheese, raspberries, pinapple, honeydew and blueberries. Thanks for the fun idea.
