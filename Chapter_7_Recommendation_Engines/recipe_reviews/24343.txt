Karen, I tried your version of these eggs and it is very good. I make mine a bit different, but they're from my grandmothers recipe and she's an Irish woman. We've been making these for years. Everyone ask's for the recipe!
 Did you know you can also make these with turkey sausage and bake them instead of deep frying them? They're very good that way, and much healthier.
I like to make them at holidays for breakfast. I serve them with Hashbrowns and fruit.

see that grey ring around the egg well i got the solution to that.
to get that grey ring around the egg you have to put the eggs under running cold water for 5 min when they are cooked then continue process and hopefully you will not have that grey ring around the egg jus plain white looks much better.

I followed the recipe up to cover eggs with sausage but then I baked mine in an oven 325Â° for about 30 minutes and we liked them like that.
Another way to get rid of the gray ring is to steam the eggs, not boil them-the ring is caused from cooking them too long. If you don't have a steamer (rice cooker will work)-put the eggs in water, cover and bring to a boil. Turn off the heat and let set for 12 minutes then cool rapidly in ice water.

This recipe is very similar to my Grandmother's. She taught us a little trick to get the sausage to adhere to the egg. Roll the dry egg in a little flour before molding sausage to egg. Works wonders!

Rave of the Christmas Eve party! Delicious! The only trouble I had was getting the sausage cooked through.  I think the oil was too hot and browned the bread crumbs too quickly.  I ended up just browning them in the fryer to get a nice even colored coat and then I baked them at 325* in the oven for about 50 minutes.  After reading quite a few recipes, I also added 2 tablespoons of all purpose flour to the sausage mixture to help the sausage adhere.  Had no problems at all! Used 1/2 sage sausage and 1/2 regular pork sausage. Came out beautiful and YUMMY!  Thanks for the great recipe, Karen!  Merry Christmas!

This recipe is delicious as written! It will also be fun to play with the ingredients as well. Update - interesting... I had made this recipe and rated it accordingly, as stated here. I then had said how it bothers me when people give recipes a poor rating based striclty on the fact that they don't care for the ingredients, having never actually made it. That part of my review was removed, but the poor ratings by people who seem to think it is their job to monitor our health are still on here. I'm sure this review won't last long either... Great recipe, however!

Good appetizer.  My friend Mary loves these. Can be baked instead of fried.  Do not omit the mustard sauce! It makes this dish pop!

IMPORTANT PREP TIP:  DRY the peeled eggs before wrapping them in sausage.  You won't have to chase them around the kitchen when they come squirting out of the wrap when you squeeze. I LOVE this dish but make it very differently.  I roll them in cracker crumbs for a softer, slightly sweeter crust and I bake them on a broiler pan (two levels to trap the fat) so they don't sit in grease.  Mustard of any kind is great, however, consider drizzling a little maple syrup instead.  Yummy.

Holy WOW! I had some friends in from London and I made these as an appetizer. They went nuts! They said these were BY FAR the best Scotch Eggs they had ever eaten. Even better than the ones they get in Britain! Thanks for the GREAT recipe!

I was so happy to find this recipe as I had lost mine. It is suprisingly delicious. I serve these as a snack during gatherings with a mustard dipping sauce and there are never leftovers.

I just made this recipe for the first time (and not the last). The only way I deviated was to use Jimmy Dean hot sausage. The combination of the spice in the sausage and the herbs added in the recipe was quite good. I recommend this recipe.

This recipe tasted just like the ones we had at a scottish pub and grill.. I made these yesterday for and appitizer before easter dinner everyone loved them.. I did take the advice of someone else and used the Sage Jimmy Dean sausage. They turned out so great. On the mustard sauce the only thing I did different was use Brown mustard instead of Yellow Mustared. Was go great this will be a great appetizer on anyday. My Boyfriend took the 2 we had left for his lunch the next day and he said they heated up great and were just as good.. Thank you for the recipe...

I have tried several variations and the original! All are yum! Try it with ground chicken or turkey sausage. I usually opt for baking them to save a few calories.

Boiling eggs:  Place eggs in large saucepan. Cover eggs w/1" of COLD WATER. Place on med. heat and bring to a ROLLING BOIL. Remove from heat, cover and let set for at least 20min. Run under cold water until eggs are cool to touch.
     To peel:Rap lightly with knuckles, NOT on the counter nor edge of the bowl. Start by getting UNDER the MEMBRANE. The shell should come away easily. If storing in the fridge, cover or put them in a zip-lok bag so they won't dry out.

I fixed these with the ingredients I had.  No lemon zest so I used lemon pepper,  Floured the eggs as suggested before putting on the sausage mixture.  They  were wonderful!  Some problems with grease digestion in this family so I baked them.  Don't know how they could be better.

I had a problem with getting the pork sausage to cover the egg evenly. I baked these instead of frying. They were still pretty good. Sauce was a little thicker than I liked, so I added a little bit of water while cooking and it was fine.

I made these for our Scottish Burns Night celebration, and they were the hit of the evening.  Absolutely delicious!  I know they'll be requested for next year's party.

Very good!  I did roll the dry eggs in flour before attempting to get the sausage to stick, and it worked well!  I did a quick fry to just brown them, then baked at 375f for about 15 minutes to finish.  For the eggs, my family gave me an egg cooker several years ago for Christmas--it steams them.  I undercooked the eggs just a bit so that they wouldn't have the grey lining nor be overcooked, and that worked well, too.

Not quite as good as my mother in laws, I'm not sure what she does different. Still a very good recipe though! The mustard sauce is a bit bland, though. My boyfriend enjoyed the meal very much though, I'm just picky and that's why I gave it 4 stars.

It's a keeper!  Made as written with some minor subs.  Used a can of quail eggs (@25/per can in the Asian aisle/grocery). Eggs were drained, rinsed well and left to dry while mixing sausage.  Used 1 lb hot Tennessee Pride sausage and added 1 tbsp each of powdered garlic and worchestershire sauce (we LOVE garlic) and used Italian breadcrumbs.  Allowed mixed to rest for 20 minutes to hydrate breadcrumbs.  Omitted lemon (don't care for it).  Used a sorbet scoop for equal sausage portions and wrapped egg in a thin layer.  After coating with breadcrumbs, wrapped each egg in plastic wrap and put in freezer for 20 minutes or until slightly firm.  I then shallow pan-fried to brown the top and bottom and then put them in the oven for 15-20 minutes at 350.  The mini-freeze keeps them intact for the pan fry and the browning kept them crispy.  I made the mustard sauce but quickly realized it was just honey mustard.  Next time I'll just skip the step if I already have it in the frig.  I also served them with maple syrup and Dijon mustard mixed with mayo and pepper.  The were the perfect appetizer-sized portions on a toothpick.  Next time, I'll try turkey sausage (some family members don't eat pork and I felt bad for leaving them out).

You need a finely ground, high fat content sausage.  Let it sit out until it is room temperature.  Take alot of time making the sausage coating even and pack it tight, if you don't they splite while cooking.  Don't use "jumbo" eggs.  I find the medium to large eggs are ideal.

Made this for brunch today, and we loved it! When making the mustard sauce, be sure to remove it from heat, as stated  in recipe, or it will get too thick! Other than that, it was easy, following the recipe, and I will make it again, and recommend it to friends n family!

The eggs are great with turkey sausage as well!  My only complaint is the sauce.  Although great when spread lightly over the eggs, the sauce is very rich and definitely not for those who hate mayonnaise.

I am only reviewing the mustard sauce as I used another recipe for the eggs but the sauce was amazing. It really finished the eggs nicely. I would recommend having everything ready before you start, including a bowl to pour it in because even after I took it off the heat it seamed to still keep cook until I got it into another container. My hunny said he will be finishing this off on chicken patties for lunch today.

The best find ever is Willamette farms cooked and peeled eggs ( I found at Win-co food store) I can never peel the eggs without losing 
"chunks" of egg! with that said I baked mine and they were perfect,and the mustard sauce was a hit!

Delicious! Great tip... Make sure to pat the eggs dry with a paper towel before wrapping them in the sausage

Whenever we have an office food party, this is the recipe I am always asked to make.  One of the ladies I work with is from New Zealand, and she almost cried when she tasted this for the first time.  I asked her what was wrong, and she said, "Nothing.  It's so perfect, it reminds me of home."

I was sceptical about trying this recipe as the intro is completely wrong - I was right to be sceptical. Scotch eggs are actually not Scottish, no one in Scotland has them for breakfast (scotch egg AND sausage AND fried egg? Never) or hot with gravy. I told several Scottish friends about the statement and they were all amazed at the misinformation. In UK, they are served cold for picnics or parties. 
But to the recipe. Traditionally they are made with really good quality sausage meat so don't need all the extra herbs and spices. But I can't judge a recipe if I don't follow it so I tried. Not a fan of the dried herbs - a little fresh sage would work better with the pork sausage - and nutmeg/lemon just seemed plain wrong. I think I might try just lemon zest which could be interesting. 
A couple of tips - when you finish boiling the eggs, plunge immediately in cold water - prevents a dark ring round the  yolk. Dusting the egg in flour before the sausage makes it adhere better. Some reviews have suggested baking - why not, it's not a proper scotch egg so carry on. But a real scotch egg is always fried. 
The sauce was OK - again, not traditionally British but quite fun. The only part of the recipe I would make again.

The grey ring is from overcooking the eggs.  In addition to the grey/green ring, they are very rubbery when overcooked.  To hard-boil eggs perfectly, try covering with cold water, then boiling for 6-7 minutes.  Once done, run under cold water until cool enough to handle and peel.  Perfect every time and easy to peel, too!

I've made these about 20 times now it's a new family favorite! ^.^  we greatly enjoy them for breakfast, but they can take awhile to prepare, so I always start the night before have the eggs boiled, meat rolled into balls ready to go around the eggs, and get the sauce made. Leave it all in the fridge over night paddy up the eggs and fry in the morning! Fast and ready for breakfast, best part is they keep you full for so long!  I love everything about this recipe (Tip! make sure you get the sausage tight around the eggs air bubbles or cracks can cause it to part or come off when frying them so make sure it's snug and no noticeable cracks. +  dry off the eggs before putting the in the fridge over night so they will be dry and easy to wrap the sausage around in the morning)

Loved the hint of lemon.
Baked at 375 for 30-40 minutes.
Turned out great.

I used turkey breakfast sausage and tried to bake them in the oven.  You could not taste much difference with the additional spices except the added lemon.
     There was not enough fat in the sausage to allow browning in the oven.  I ended up pan frying to get them to crisp.
     I used 2 cups of crumbs for the outside coating.
     The mustard dipping sauce is very good and adds a nice touch to the eggs.

Easy recipe to follow. The only change I made was to use smoked ham sausage that I purchased from Edwards in Virginia instead of regular ground pork. The mustard sauce was also delicious, but the next time I will fiddle around with that part of the recipe and make it lighter or use it for another dish.

This "Scotch Eggs with Mustard Sauce" recipe did not quite work for me: I had enough meat to cover the eggs but it "cracked open" while I was cooking the eggs. If I were to make this again, I would either use more meat (or perhaps a different sausage meat) and/or smaller eggs. On the plus side, the lemon rind in the meat was absolutely delicious. I learned a new trick! Thank you Karen for sharing your recipe.

Loved the recipe but I did make some changes, added stone ground mustard to mayo, no extra egg added,  didn't cook it at all. After all, mayo is eggs! Also I baked them in the oven at 400 for 30 min. instead of frying. The hubby-do loved them! Next time I make them I will use the Jimmy Dean sausage, that is very flavorful, I had first tasted them at our Rennie Fair,  where we have a pirate encampment, and that is what our fellow pirate chick used, and fed us all breakfast, with no mustard sauce. :(  Didn't know about the mustard sauce until I found this recipe, glad that I did.

VERY similar to the recipe I have in a cookbook from Scotland.  These are always a hit with my family and potlucks (we cut them in half and place on plate so everybody gets one!).

Drying the cooked egg thoroughly and dusting with flour before wrapping with sausage really makes the coating process easier! 

I also like to coat with bread/panko crumbs before frying -- gives them a nice crisp crust.  

My favorite substitute is to use 1/2 ground ham and 1/2 Italian sausage.  I also press out circles between plastic wrap about 4" in diameter.

Fantastic!  First time my husband and I had Scotch eggs and we loved it.  I baked it instead of frying to make it a little healthier as well.  The mustard sauce and really good sausage definitely make the dish!

these sound delicious, but 78 grams of fat in 1 egg is scaring (frightening) me away. Does anyone know the fat if you bake instead of frying? I can substitute a lower fat sausage substitute if it's worthwhile. They say the oil retained makes up 10% of the nutrition, what about the fat? I guess this may be part of the reason I never hear of a Scot holding the world record for longevity...
