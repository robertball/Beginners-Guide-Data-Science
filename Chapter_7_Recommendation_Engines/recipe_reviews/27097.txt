Everybody loved this.  Even better the next day.  I used flour tortillas and left out the olives (my fam's preference).  Very easy to make.  For us, this makes 8 servings (only because everybody wants seconds).  We're having leftovers tonight!!  Easy to reheat in micro.

We really enjoyed this! Very easy and quick, with ingredients I already had on hand. Surprisingly tasty too - not hot, just flavorful. I did use flour tortillas as I've found in the past that the corn ones tend to become heavy and gummy. Also had to use more cheese but that's just my family's preference. Excellent recipe, even my somewhat picky husband gives it a thumbs up!!

Everyone that tried this loved it.  I think it's one of my favorites now.  I used Green Enchilada sauce (I don't think it's specified) which I think tastes a lot better than red.

If you're looking for something quick, easy, and fills you up then this is your meal.  Don't expect gourment quality (it is a casserole), but all in all this is a good meal and I'll be preparing it again in the future.  The only thing I will do different is use flour tortillas instead of corn ones.

I was very pleased with the outcome of this recipe.  I love enchiladas, but they are way too labor intensive for my busy lifestyle.  I made these with ground turkey and used red La Victoria enchilada sauce, Pace chunky salsa and sharp cheddar cheese, and it turned out wonderfully!  Even my 2 year old ate a few bites.  :-)  This one is a keeper!

This recipe was awesome!  My picky husband was very skeptical due to the refried beans, but the entire dish is mixed so well, the beans aren't gummy like usual.  I also used fat free beans (couldn't tell the difference) and no olives due to family preference.  I think I'll try the green enchilada sauce next time!

This is MUCH easier than enchiladas, not quite as popular with the kids as enchiladas but they did polish this off with no trouble.

Very filling.  I used less salsa than called for, otherwise I agree with another reviewer that it would have been too much.

I used more enchilada sauce then required, and added some salt and lots of pepper.  It turned out greta, it was a lot like Chili's Skillet Queso in flavor, and we made extra tortillas to eat it with.  Yum.

I found this recipe on Ortega's website and I prepared it for dinner for my EXTREMELY finicky husband a few months ago.  It was a HUGE hit!  I't very easy to prepare and bake, and it's very delicious!  Since it's just my husband and myself, the leftovers are always gone the next afternoon!  ROCKIN' DISH!!

No one in my family was impressed with this recipe.  Too much salsa or something.

My husband really liked this one.  He says it is the traditional Mexican way to make enchiladas.  It was a lot quicker than rolling the tortillas.

I varied this recipe by using ground pork & my family's own favorite brands of salsa and 
beans, etc.  Also, olives were omitted due to family tastes.  

This was a big hit for Mexican Food Night.

This was a big hit with the family.  I added more cheeses to give it a little extra zip.

This was so good. My husband and I love Mexican food, so I am always trying new recipes. I know I'll be making this often and beats the same old tacos and so on from the kits and still just as easy.

I love this recipe.  Good and spicy.  Even better reheated.  Use fat-free refried beans...can't taste the difference.
