This is a delicious meal.  And a great way to use ground turkey.  Low calorie, high in flavor!!  I'll put just a bit of sesame oil in the dressing next time for more clinging to the salad.

the flavors were delicious & spot on, however it was waaay too spicy.  next time I will leave out the Thai chiles completely & halve the cayenne pepper in the dressing.

i made this recipe but i didnt have cayenne pepper, carrot, the toasted rice, basil or mint or parsley (or was it cilantro) and used chicken and coriander instead.  

it still tastes awfully delicious and i am proud to cook this fave dish of mine as my first foray into thai dishes.

Yummy! Perfect as is and so much easier than other larb recipes I've found. I had an extra lime and thought I'd use it but I think the recipe was probably perfect without it!

I didn't use onions and upped the chili pepper amount cuz I like spicy! I only had seasoned rice vinegar so it came out a lil sweeter than I'd have liked, but overall freakin yummmmmmm

super yummy, healthy and fresh. I added like 3 additional TBS of sugar and skipped the rice flakes. I also used 2 Anaheim peppers sans the seeds instead of Thai Chiles.

This was really good and very fresh tasting. Served with lettuce cups. Added a little bit more fish sauce, a dash of soy, and served with Sriracha. 
Had to sub jicama for water chestnuts and a cubanelle for Thai chilies (what I had on hand). 
3 adults, no leftovers = success! Thank you.

I made two different Larb recipes last night and this one was definitely better hands down. It seems like a lot of ingredients but it is well worth it in the end. We really liked these with all of the different flavors and texture. It is also a recipe that could easily be changed up for what you like or what you have on hand.  By the way, LOVE the name and the reference to Bon Jovi! You had me at Bon Jovi :)
