I really liked these but the family wasn't as impressed. I think they would've preferred traditional pumpkin pancakes. They ate them but didn't enjoy them as much as normal. Made as stated but added added a pinch of ginger and nutmeg too.

Instead of the regular maple syrup, I cut a banana, put it on a little skillet with little bit of butter , water and let it simmer until completly cook, and smear it on top of the pancakes,  
One or two bananas, 2 tbs butter , 2 tbs water, and let it simmer , mashing the bananas until done about 5 minuetes

Nice, fluffy, tender pancake. I left the brown sugar out.

Very good! Made exactly as given. Turned out well. I think you definitely need to have a bit of patience so they cook completely! The cornmeal adds interesting texture. I think it’s a keeper, made it for New Year’s Day breakfast!

These are super good.  I have been wanting to try these for a while and finally got the chance.  These will be on the menu from now on.  Followed the recipe exactly and would not change a thing.  They smell great cooking.  The batter is very thick and cooking needs to be a bit lower on temp but, worth the extra wait.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I used raw brown sugar which made the pancakes slightly sweeter. The pancakes or griddles came out amazing with no cal/no sugar syrup! Perfect to Freeze with wax paper for those busy mornings and then just use the toaster to reheat!

This recipe is perfect! The only change I made is used 1/2 cup regular cornmeal, and 1/2 cup course cornmeal for added texture. I topped my pancakes with whipped cream, chopped pecans, chopped bacon, and maple syrup.

These were great! The only changes I made were to use avocado oil and whole wheat pastry flour in the batter and I used a non-stick griddle so didn't need the extra oil, otherwise I followed the recipe.  They were moist and fluffy and had a nice flavor. Next time I might cut back on the brown sugar, but that's just a personal preference. As is I didn't think they even needed syrup,  I ate about four of them while i was cooking them up for everyone else!

I had to change some things because I didn't have all the ingredients: almond milk for regular milk, Jiffy mix for pure cornmeal. No doubt it changed tastes, but not in a negative way!  A little like dessert for breakfast, but once you add in the savory eggs and bacon it balances really well. I didn't have maple syrup, so I took butter, apple butter, maple flavoring, and walnuts; melted it down and BOOM! Homemade syrup.

I made these for my picky husband and grandson and son. They all said this is their new favorite pancake, even though they were skeptical of the new recipe. Success!! Thanks.

My husband is a pancake lover and he says these are the best he has ever eaten. I substituted Stevia blend brown sugar, added a dash of cardamom and used fresh pumpkin puree. They were so tasty with pecans and maple syrup along with some fresh berries.
Since I have a lot of pumpkin puree left, I will be making these again, soon.

Per my kids request, This is our new go-to for a thanksgiving breakfast tradition! I added a dash of ginger and nutmeg, and I didn't measure the cinnamon either. I did add a bit more milk until desired consistency. Served with cream cheese frosting (already made from previous event) and honey walnut cream cheese spread.

Fantastic!  I only used 1/3 cup brown sugar, and topped it with some toasted pecans and maple syrup.  The texture is fantastic and will definitely be making these more.

So light and fluffy! These tasty pancakes are a perfect breakfast. I was worried that with the brown sugar they would be too sweet, but not so. I used fresh made pumpkin apple butter instead of canned pumpkin. Thank you for the recipe.

Loved the combination of cornmeal and pumpkin in this recipe. I also made a batch of pumpkin syrup to top these with. Yummy!
