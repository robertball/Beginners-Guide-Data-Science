I used 2 lbs side of wild Alaska salmon. Cut recipe in half marinated in refrigerator over night. Don't have a smoker so I used my grill on low about 300F for 30 min cedar planks under the fish. Let it cool to room temp. Came out terrific.

SO delicious! After soaking in the brine overnight I smoked the salmon on my little stove top smoker. It works like a charm and I will be making this over and over again.

This is an excellent brine. I didn't use the jalape√±os and used regular ground pepper.
