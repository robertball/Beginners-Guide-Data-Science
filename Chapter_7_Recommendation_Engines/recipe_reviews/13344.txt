This is an excellent soup. I think the pesto adds a wonderful savory dimension so unless you dislike pesto, be sure to add a dollop to the top before you serve and then stir it in. I made only some minor additions to the recipe, and that was about a 1/4 tsp. of dried thyme and a Tbsp. of good quality margarine(watching calories). The latter contributed richness to the soup without alot of added fat. I'm going to try this again and make it with roasted chicken, although it's very good as is. Husband liked it too.

This soup was greatly enjoyed by my 82-year old father-in-law.  I used canned green beans and omitted the pesto.

Great soup--quick, easy, and husband and 2 young sons love it.  We're not crazy about pesto, so leave it out along with the green beans and sometimes substitute pasta (bowties, alphabet) for the potatoe.  Wonderful served with garlic cheese bread!

Love this soup!  My only changes were I used1-1/2 pounds of chicken tenderloins instead of 1/2 pound breast, petite diced tomatoes instead of whole, a can of Italian green beans (drained) instead of frozen and some garlic powder.  The dollop of pesto is what makes this soup special.  Soooo good on a cold evening.

I made this at the last minute on a rainy Friday night after a hectic week.  It was simple to prepare and hugely comforting to my family.  I did add a couple of bay leaves and since I didn't have any pesto handy, added chopped parsley instead.  It was delicious and tasted even better the next day for lunch.  A perfect light meal with warm rolls/bread and fresh fruit.

hearty meal, which is good, but the chicken wasn't tender. So maybe it just needs to simmer longer than the recipe says, but you don't want the veggies to overcook. I'll make again but will add the broth(probably add 1/2 cup) and simmer for 15 minutes or so before adding the veggies to simmer 15 minutes more.

This soup was very good, even my fiance liked it. I added the pesto to the soup pot just before taking it off of the heat. It was good before the addition of the pesto, but it adds just a little something extra.

Very good soup.  I subbed garbanzo beans, simply because that's what I had on had, and used a green pepper instead of the carrots!

Pretty good. I used some leftover rotisserie chicken and just added it in toward to end.  I didn't have green beans, so I left them out, plus I doubled the pesto per serving and stirred it in to the soup itself.
