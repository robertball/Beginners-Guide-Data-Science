This recipe was excellent!  I gave it five stars because the taste was great and it was SO quick and easy to make (with the help of my food processor).  I do have some qualms with the recipe though. First 4 cups is NOT 4 servings if you're using instant mashed potatoes, if you only make 4 servings you won't have enough to top the casserole (learned this the hard way).  My next potato problem is the mixing in of the cubed cheese, this makes it awful hard to spread on the casserole and is completely unnecessary:  you'll lose nothing if you simply sprinkle the cubed cheese on after you spoon on the potatoes.  As far as alterations go, I doubled the onion and added a good amount of crushed garlic (to the potatoes) to prevent the blandness other reviews ran into.  A nice sprinkling of paprika might make an attractive and tasty addition too.  All and all, this was fast and delicious!  I'll make it again!

This was a good use of leftovers and a nice comfort meal.  I used a layer of stuffing as my base, then added the turkey and topped that with frozen green beans.  Soup went on top, but I think that next time I would thin the soup with some milk to make it more spreadable.  Used about half the amounts of cheese called for; felt a full pound of cheese would just be overpowering.  Topped the mashed potatos with french fried onions as there is no way that raw onions are going to cook in the casserole in 30-40 minutes and would be too sharp/overpowering.  The fried onions made for a nice crispy topping.

Made this after Thanksgiving, and our guests loved this. I also used a can of mushrooms in it.  One thing I would change; As everything else in it was already "cooked" basically, the onions had a very strong almost raw flavor, as it was only heated for 30 minutes.  I would lightly saute' them before adding them in the next time.  I will definitely make this again.

We really liked this recipe.  I was using leftover turkey which was REALLY dry, so I mixed it with about 1 cup of chicken broth and some sauteed shallots.  I then put a layer of corn on top of the turkey mixed, followed by cheese and cream of chicken soup.  I then used a layer of mashed potatoes, sprinkled with more cheese and a little butter and parm to make it crusty on top.  Yum.

This was a really good Shepard's pie casserole that used turkey in place of beef. It was very good will be making this again in the future. I put the green beans in between the shredded cheese and potato mixture. It stills needs something either garlic or a dash of hot pepper sauce. But very good as written.

In my case, it was a layer of leftover turkey, topped by freshly sauteed onions, topped with leftover green bean casserole, then a layer of cream of mushroom soup (which I stirred with some leftover chicken soup stock and some of the mashed potatoes) before topping with the last of the leftover potatoes.

This is definitely a keeper!  In the interest of cutting fat, I omitted the cubed cheddar cheese and mixed half of the shredded cheddar into the potatoes.  I suggest chopping the onion fairly fine to insure that it is cooked in the 30-40 minutes.  Anyway, I'll definitely make this again!

I made this with leftover roasted chicken. I topped the chicken with the rest of the green bean casserole I had made and instead of soup, I poured in my leftover gravy. Didn't have any cheddar on hand, so I topped the potatoes with grated parm and sprinkled with paprika. Yum Peggikaye!

I made this recipe with only one change.  I switched from the green beans to peas but made no other substitutions. For the life of me and my family we could not imagine how this rated an allover 4 1/2 stars.  It was like eating an extremely bad version of shephard's pie.  I don't know if was the mushroom soup (which did not provide much flavor) or the fact that turkey does not have a strong enough flavor to carry the dish but the ingredients just did not meld together.  Sorry folks but this just isn't worth making.

Great way to use up Thanksgiving leftovers, especially the potatoes!  Kids and adults both really like this. I do not use two types of cheese just the crumbles they sell now 16oz. Must really like cheese, as most people do. It is very quick and super yummy! I have lost count how many times I have made this now with those leftovers. Thank you, for posting.

Wow! This was way better than I thought it would be! It sounds bland but everyone loved it & it was devoured by my picky family. I used broccoli instead of green beans & added a can of mushrooms. Also I did not add the cubed cheese but layered extra grated cheese over the onions. No additional spices, however I did have very good homemade garlicky mashed potatoes so that might have made the difference.

I made this and then froze it for a couple of months, defrosting and cooking it when I had a newborn baby and didn't have much time to spend in the kitchen. It was great, tasty and filling and reheated beautifully.

I made this using our Thanksgiving leftovers.  I was looking for a casserole that didn't call for stuffing, because we had already thrown ours out.  It was delicious - my husband loved it, and even my picky son who doesn't like mashed potatoes ate it. I used all white-meat turkey, sauteed the onions along with some shallot, mixed some sour cream in with the mushroom soup, used a little less cheese, mixed some more sour cream with the mashed potatoes so they wouldn't be dry, and sprinkled a little thyme in on top of the green beans and on the top of the mashed potatoes.  I also topped it with french's fried onions and sprinkle of cheese.  I also baked it in a 9X9 because I thought my servings were a little small.  It was good stuff!

I rated this high because of the delicious taste, so easy, and the only ingredients used that were not leftovers were the onions, soup,  and cheese- I always have that  on hand,too. I did improvised with what leftovers I had, and after tasting, I'll make another change. I followed the recipe except I substitued the green beans with creamed corn- omitted the cheese cubes - added a bit of milk to my mashed potatoes before spreading on the top. This made the  m.potatoes spread better.  I had leftover gravy, so I poured the heated gravy over the casserole servings on the plate. This gave a richer and moist taste. Now, what I would do different: the onions were too crunchy and strong, I would saute them before adding them to the casserole. But this is definitely a keeper, in fact, my husband raved about it. That's a huge compliment since he's an excellent cook himself. Thank Peggikaye!!!

This recipe was both easy and delicious! In place of the onions, green beans and mushroom soup, I just used the left over green bean casserole I had in the fridge (being that those are all ingredients found in it anyway). I also used Mild and Sharp Cheddar as well as Colby Jack cheeses - delicious! Although I didn't try it this time, the next time I have it, I'm going to pour my left over turkey gravy on top and see how that tastes! This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This was just great.  I doubled up on the turkey, the onions and the mashed potatoes.  I halved the cubed cheese and placed them on the potatoes rather than mix them in.  It is a wonderful, easy and inexpensive festive meal preceded with a nice green salad.  I served 5 people with very little leftover.

In my husband's words: "It's a keeper".  The entire family loved it.  What a great way to use up the leftovers from a turkey dinner. I followed a couple of suggestions and mixed some gravy in with the turkey.  I also minced the onion so it would cook better.  I used frozen beans, cooking them slightly before adding them to the casserole.  I mixed about 1/4 cup milk with the cream of mushroom soup so it would spread easier. I added some garlic powder (about 1/2 tsp.) to the top of the beans.  Finally, I used less cheese, mixing about 8 oz. total shredded cheese into the potatoes.  I cooked it over about an hour and everything was done perfectly.

I used a can of condensed cheddar soup instead and cut out the cubed cheese. I added a sprinkle of garlic powder for extra flavor and topped off with the crunchy onions to add texture. It was yummmmmy!!! :-)

I tried this last night to use up some leftover turkey and it was pretty tasty! I didn't quite follow the layering directions and I wish that I had in retrospect-- but the casserole was easy to make and my other half was raving about it. I'm not a mushroom soup fan but it really compliments the other flavours. Will definitely make again after roasting a turkey and would recommend to a friend :)

Made exactly as recipe states.  It was a little bland for my taste.  I guess next time I need to spice my mashed potatoes up more.  It is similar to a shepherd's pie. I would recommend making it, though.  Definitely a good starter.

I call this recipe the "White Meat Shepard's Pie"  It's very good!!! I sautee the onion and turkey (which I season w/ some of my favorite seasoning) in olive oil and then toss it w/ the soup before adding to the baking dish... I then add the string beans add a layer of cheese, I normally make fresh mashed potatoes that I season w/ butter and italian seasoning, then add another layer of cheese.... It turns out great everytime!!!

This was a great recipe for our Thanksgiving leftovers. I left out the onion and used seasoned butter corn and fresh chopped green beans. I had cream of potato soup on hand and added some half & half to thin it out. With the shredded cheese I added some taco seasoning and used cream cheese in the mashed potatoes! YUM!

This recipe is great!  My husband made it the day after thanksgiving with the leftovers.  Nice and creamy and the onion gave it a nice crunch.  I don't have canned veggies so used the beans we had left over as well.  This is a keeper and will make it again!  Thanks for a great recipe!

It was really, really good!  I used about 1/2 the cheese called for (16 oz just sounded like a lot).  I also did a "crust" layer w/stuffing, poured the extra gravy over it, and then used cream of chicken rather than cream of mushroom b/c we didn't have it on hand.  It was quite tasty, my guests loved it, and it was a GREAT way to use up leftovers!!  I'll definitely do it again.

For such a simple 'leftovers' casserole, we all enjoyed this! I didn't layer anything, just mixed the onions and green beans right in with the turkey and soup.  Per other reviews, I did microwave the chopped onions for a minute to soften a bit.  I used what was left in a package of shredded cheddar and sprinkled that on top, then topped that with some American cheese slices since that was all I had. Threw it all together in 5 minutes, headed out to the barn and came back an hour later to a scrumptious, bubbly comfort-food casserole. Oh, I used leftover mashed sweet potatoes, (no marshmallows, yuk!) that had a pecan, brown sugar topping and it was soooooo good!

I'm a novice cook, but this turned out devine! This recipe rocks. We had some frozen turkey meat from a couple months ago and I used the "Traditional mashed potatoes" recipe from this site. I substituted broccoli and cauliflower for the green beans. Broccoli and cauliflower with a layer of grated cheddar cheese, come on...a trio made in heaven. Personally, I loved the cubed cheese mixed into the mashed potato. I also caramelized the onions for my two year old, but my husband loved this little change. Finally, I made gravy from a package and there you have it---a new family favourite.

We really liked this.  We used frozen peas instead of canned beans and didn't have enough cheese to add it to the potatoes.  Because all our ingrediants were from the fridge, we had to cook it for 50-55 minutes.  Doesn't seem like leftovers at all.  The flavors were all new.

I made a couple changes to this. First I put a layer of stuffing on the bottom covered by a layer of cut up turkey. Then drizzled gravy over that followed by half green bean casserole and half corn casserole. My wife's favorite is the green been and mine the corn. Then covered with shredded cheese. Then topped with creamy mashed potatoes. Cheese underneath so it would melt down into all ingredients. REALLY good.

The concept for this recipe is fantastic--what a great idea (a turkey shepard pie).  I sauteed 1T minced garlic to the onion in 2T butter. After these were cooked, I added the soup and 1/2 can milk.  I read other reveiwer comments and thought they were fantastic--I had some leftover corn so added that along with the green beans, used 1 8oz pkg grated cheese and topped the mashed potatoes with crushed fried onions. I needed that crunch.  This is a keeper for me with the added comments of other reviewers.  I felt it would be too bland for my tastes as originally written. The concept is great.

Pretty good! It was a good use of leftover turkey. I'll double the cream of mushroom soup next time though, we like our casseroles nice and creamy.  I did add more spices as other reviewers suggested, and it turned out super yummy. :)

Very, very yummy!  Everyone at my day-two thanksgiving party really enjoyed it and went back for seconds.  The only thing I did differently is cook the onions first.  thanks for the great recipe, I'll be using this one every year.

This recipe is a great idea to use leftovers. It feeds an army! I sauteed the onions in butter and garlic before hand and added seasoning to every layer (salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, etc). I also added a can of mushrooms. I didn't use cubed cheese, it seemed too fattening, so I used a package of low fat shredded cheddar cheese. I finished it off with paprika on of the potatoes. YUM!

YUM!  My whole family loved this.  I layered prepared wild rice stuffing mix on bottom,  turkey on top (left over from the great crockpot turkey breast recipe on this site), then sauteed mushrooms, onion and celery on top of that, canned green beans next, then one can Golden Mushroom, one can 98% fat free Cream of mushroom soup, both mixed together with some leftover turkey broth,  soy sauce and pepper, then topped it all with some homemade mashed potatos (made with fat free evaporated milk) and finally, a sprinkling of 2% shredded cheddar.  If making it from Thanksgiving leftovers, I would have most of these ingredients already prepared.  Everyone had seconds and a few of us had thirds....  Really, really good!

This is a great base recipe for leftover turkey.  I layered leftover stuffing with the turkey and mixed some of the juice from the canned beans to the soup to thin it out a bit.  I didn't add the onion as my husband isn't a big onion eater.  I also used a low sodium soup or will also try a low fat soup.  I didn't use the cheese cubes but just sprinkled shredded cheese on top of the potatoes about 15 minutes before it was finished cooking.  We both enjoyed it very much and will definitely do it again.

This recipe was great - very filling. I omitted the green beans & used corn. Also added some leftover turkey gravy. I used 2 cups of shredded colby in the mashed potatoes & my top layer on potatoes was durkee onions.  The crispy top gave it that extra touch.

This casserole is fabulous! I made a few changes, I only chopped about 1/4 of a cup of onion instead of a whole one and added mushrooms and 3 cloves of garlic and followed the advice of another poster and sauteed them altogether prior to adding to the dish.  

I also added about 3/4 of a container of reduced fat sour cream to the potatoes to make them smoother. Next time I will not add the cubes of cheese into the potatoes, there was a bit too much cheese for us and we love cheese. 8oz of shredded cheese is plenty!  

Lastly, I did not use green beans. I used a 15oz can of veg-all mixed veggies and LOVED it! I think the variety in veggies is better than just green beans. It reminded me of a turkey shepherds pie and the kids loved this one as well!

I was looking for a recipe to use up all of my Thanksgiving leftovers.  I had a couple of cups of homemade mashed potatoes, 2 turkey drumsticks, 2 turkey wings, and about 1 & 1/2 cups of carrots and turnips, mashed together.  I saw that other reviewers had added their own veggies to their casseroles, with good results, so I made mine with the ingredients above.  Also, like a previous reviewer suggested, I lightly sauteed the onion before adding it to the baking dish.  The only other alteration that I did was that I needed to use 2 cans of the cream of mushroom soup.  It came out really well!  I never make casseroles, because I don't generally like them, but this was a hit for both me and the rest of the family.  I will definately make this again next T-Day!

This was really good!  Adjusted ingredients a bit... added 1 1/2 can sliced green beens, and a bit more turkey, which I just chopped finely as we dont have a food processor.  Added TWO cans of soup.. one cream of chicken, and one cream of mushroom (we were out of milk, so used straight). Added a few cloves of finely minced garlic to the potatoes, as well as 2 small cans sliced mushrooms.  Shredded all the cheese rather than cube part of it.  Baked 35 min, then added a pack of those pop container bisquits to the top.  Baked about 10 minutes more, was great!

Wow!! This was really good.  I followed some of the other suggestions, and put leftover stuffing on the bottom.  I didn't use as much cheese, and I used the fried onions that we didn't use on the green bean casserole to go on top.  I really liked this, and so did my husband

This is exactly the kind of comforting casserole I was looking for!  I will be using garlic flavored mushroom soup to "soup" up the blandness some and cheddar flavored mashed potatoes to make it even easier.  Can't wait to serve it!

This really was just average for me. I added about 1/2 cup of onion and also used a drained can of green beans instead of corn. While it was nice to use up some of my leftovers, I found this frankly unexiciting. Sorry!

I followed Linda M's advice, using leftover green bean casserole, gravy and parmesan cheese.  We thought it tasted like Thanksgiving dinner all over again!

Very yummy. My leftover turkey was dry from being overdone on the BBQ. This recipe moistened it up. It was very easy, and I even steamed fresh beans and spuds, then mashed the spuds. As I say, yummy and easy!!!

I realize some dislike a review when the recipe is altered but I really wanted to Thank You! for the great idea. We used stuffing as the first layer as well, adding raw chopped onions/celery to the stuffing after it is made (my husband and I like the crunch and love onions/celery). We used real potatoes (baked and then mashed). We used Turkey Gravy thinned a little instead of mushroom soup. Substitutions aside we followed the application and quantities as written except for adding garlic to the Yukon gold mashed potatoes and the added stuffing. Thank you again for giving us the base setup to work with!

Thanksgiving leftovers turned out great with this recipe! A couple of small change I used shredded cheese in the potatoes and added bacon bits to the top, also I used leftover green beans with bacon and slivered almonds, over the canned. Next time I would add a layer of leftover stuffing under the mashed potatoes.

Ok, this mod is a complete winner!!  My daughter and I ate half of it, and we are stuffed.  So same basic recipe but change the 8 oz of shredded to 6, 8 oz of cubed to 4 oz (small cubes).  Add 1/2 cup of chicken broth fortified with 1 tsp of powdered chicken broth base.  Also have 1/2 cup of leftover turkey gravy along with 1 1/2 cups of French's fried onions and a third of a stick of butter.  So start with the shredded turkey, put on the onion (sauteed is probably better), then the green beans and then the cream of mushroom.  It spread just right in the 9x13.  Next I added the 1/2 cup of broth with powdered base and liberal salt and pepper.  Add the shredded cheese a then the gravy (mine was congealed so it spread rather than poured).  Add the mashed potato mix with the cheese and then pour the melted butter  over the top with more salt and pepper.  Add the fried onion topping and then into the oven.  I left mine in closer to 40 minutes (make sure you have a pan under it to keep any over boil contained).  This was awesome!!!!

I used french style green beans instead of cut, I sauteed the onions first, I used the  two bags of the Idahoan Buttery Home-style mashed potatoes and I did add garlic powder to them. I did not uses cubed cheese but I added shredded cheddar to the potatoes instead. I was great! They went for seconds.

OH MY YUMMINESS!!!
I used the bones of this recipe with the extra stuff I had laying around. So the recipe is pretty much spot on except I didn't have enough mushroom soup so I mixed mushroom and cream of chicken soup. I used one commenters tip about putting a layer of stuffing on the bottom, I was not disappointed in that decision. This will forever be my go to "Clean out the Fridge" recipe! Now excuse me, I'm going back for seconds!

Took a leap of faith and made this for the first time for a late New Years Eve supper after midnight for 30 people.  Changed peas for the beans to make buffet handling simpler as well as brighter and added a teaspoon of garlic powder as suggested.   It was wonderful!  A definite keeper.

Great way to use leftovers in a delicious and comforting dish. Similar to a shepherd's pie. I sautéed the onions in butter before adding to the casserole and I used a frozen, mixed vegetable mix instead of just green beans. I did not add cheese cubes to the mashed potatoes (the shredded cheese was plenty) and it was perfect. Thank you for a easy and yummy recipe.

This was surprisingly good. I used less cheese and added salt and pepper to the potatoes and added some homemade leftover gravy after the cream of mushroom soup layer. I also used corn instead of beans. I wouldn't make this from scratch, but will make again with leftovers. It was quick and simple.

This was easy and it did taste great however  it calls for 1 can of green beans to cover the turkey completely.  Not possible in a 9×13 dish that this  recipe calls for.  So because it calls for cream of mushroom and green beans I just used my left over green bean casserole and it worked out perfectly. Also a little hint...   instead of mixing the cubs of cheese into the mashed potatoes  ( that is not as easy as it sounds ) I just took the potatoes and spread it all over the top then scattered the  cubes of cheese all over the top lightly pushing them down into the mashed potatoes. That was sooooo much better.

I used stuffing as my base. Then the shredded turkey and a little bit of the left over gravy. Then I used a can of green beans and topped that layer with a roasted garlic cream of mushroom soup. I add a splash of milk to the soup for easier spreading. Topped that layer with shredded cheese, potatoes, crispy fried onions, and another layer of shredded cheese. Covered with foil and removed the foil the last 10 minutes. Quiet good and we will make it again.

I was pleasantly surprised how good this tasted.  'Barnkitty' had good suggestions: put stuffing on bottom, turkey, shredded cheese, soup w/ a bit of milk, and mashed potatoes w/ minced garlic and finally topping everything with fried onions. I served green beans on the side however.

I used left over turkey gravy instead of soup. I also ran out of potato's so covered the other half with leftover stuffing. There was quite a bit of liquid after cooking. i just drained it out. my kids always eat their meals. just under slight protest, i cook ok(been a single dad for 2 years, still learning domestic skills, you women have it  hard!)but this meal they both had second helpings and completely loved it

This was nothing special.  My family agreed it was just like eating the turkey, potatoes & green beans on a plate, just all mixed together. No distinctive or different flavor, really.  I used fresh minced onions, but had to bake it an extra 30 minutes & the onions still weren't done. I should have used the extra green onions I had on hand. Bottom line, we won't be making this again.

On a plus side, this would be a different kind of casserole for a pot luck supper. With no strong flavors, it would probably go over well.  Just cook the onions first, or better yet, use onion powder.

I found this today searching for easy Thanksgiving left over ideas... This recipe is a great base! I tweaked it a little to suit what I had on hand. From bottom to top: shredded turkey, chopped onion, fresh raw spinach leaves, fresh sliced mushrooms, about a cup and a half left over canned gravy, mashed potatoes which I warmed and thinned with a little milk first and then a sprinkling of shredded cheddar... YUM!!!

Great recipe...I didn't have an onion on hand so used French's french fried onions and two cans of french style green beans. I made it early in the day and baked it for supper. I have more leftovers yet so I think I'll try assembling it in a tin pan and freezing it so we can enjoy it another time (and I'll have stress-free meal prep for another day).

This was delicious!!! I used red potatoes because that is what I had on hand and left the skins on. I didn't use the cheese cubes and that helped save on calories (and ww points). It really is like Thanksgiving in a bowl...very good!

I adjusted the recipe to fit a 9x9 pampered chef stoneware pan. used about 1/2 the turkey; since i didn't have an onion i used french fried onions (from can) with the can of green beans over the meat. Sprinkled cheese on this as suggested and topped with 2 white and 1 sweet potato micro-cooked and mashed with a bit of milk.  I skipped the extra cheese w/ potato mixture and sprinkled garlic powder and paprika on top of all.  Baked about 25 mins. this was really good!  We didn't miss the extra cheese at all.  Made a good lunch box meal the next day (warmed in the microwave)  a keeper!

This recipe is the best for Thanksgiving leftovers.  A few changes. I omitted the cheese and added stuffing. Used frozen mixed veggies. Added milk to the mashed potatoes and warmed them up to make them easier to spred. Will use again next year.

I was a little skeptical about this recipe because of the green beans but I must say it was really, really tasty!  The flavor reminded me of a pot pie.  The best thing was it used up all the left over turkey, green beans and mashed potatoes I had from Thanksgiving!!  Thanks for sharing, I will definitely make again and not wait til next Thanksgiving.

This was really good. I used chicken instead of turkey and seasoned it well with salt, pepper, and garlic salt.  I also added milk to the soup per other suggestions, and then mixed the soup with the green beans instead of pouring over the top.  Will make again.

I pretty much followed the recipe, except to saute the onions with a little garlic to avoid the raw taste, and mixed a little milk in with the cream of mushroom soup to be able to spread it. It is missing something. There are no spices in this recipe and I think that is the problem. I may try it again using herbes de provence maybe mixed in with the soup, or otherwise, mix all the base ingredients in the dish then top with potatoes. I also didn't add the cubed cheddar , thought that was overkill with the cheese, and glad I didn't. It was cheesy enough with just the 8 oz shr. cheddar that I used. I think I'll make it again, but I've got to doctor it up. Hubby agrees that something is missing.

I'm giving this 4 stars because it was a good way to use Thanksgiving leftovers but the flavor was just okay.  The mushroom soup just didn't go with the rest of the flavors.  Maybe it would have been better with cream of chicken.  My favorite part was the cheesy mashed potatoes.  YUM! YUM!

My husband and I loved this recipe so much, we made it two days in a row...It gave us leftovers to take to work and it was delicious (and we had a LOT Of turkey left over). The second day, we added carrots and gravy because I didn't have beans or cream soup. Oh, and we tossed in stuffing, too, and used swiss instead of cheddar. This is definitely going on favorite meals rotation. Thank you!

My family loved this casserole.  I did make some changes--I found that I was out of onions and did not use them at all.  I thinned the soup with some milk to make it spread more evenly.  I decreased the amount of cheese, only sprinkled less than 1/2 cup shredded cheese on the top of the potatoes and it was wonderful.

Great way to use up the leftovers from Thanksgiving. I didn't measure the ingredients.  Shredded the turkey until the bottom of the dish was about covered. Then layered green bean casserole that was left over.  A layer of shredded cheese then the layer of mashed potatoes (mixed in some shredded cheese in the potatoes)and sprinkled a little more cheese on the top.

pretty good! i read other reviews; i put some dressing on the bottom and halved the potatoes to control the carbs; used less cheese. i couldn't taste any cheese so i'll increase it next time. used instant potatoes since the fresh were all gone. added the french fried onions on top, very nice touch.
it was nice to have the sage and thyme flavors from the dressing. i heated up some gravy too.
good one for the leftovers.

Pretty good way to use the leftovers.  As like others, I used my green bean casserole leftovers in lieu of beans and onions, but I also added a can of soup and a small can of musrooms, everything else as per this recipe.  It was enjoyed by all.  Will definately make again  with whatever leftovers are around.

I did this with chicken and Potato Buds. I thought it was good, but wonder if Velveta would have melted better in the potatoes. I would like to try the real left over version...with the homemade green beans instead of canned!

I loved this recipe. My whole family did to. I only changed one thing and that is I bought betty crocker flavored three cheese mashed potatos made both packs and toped the Casserole with that instead of bothering with the cheese wich makes it hard to mix. Thank you for such a great recipe!

This was really good. We all ate seconds. The only changes I made was sprinkling some seasoned salt between 2 of the layers and I also added some fresh mushrooms that I had on hand. This will be fun to work with. Goodbye Turkey Tetrazzini!
