My husband kept on talking about a "cherry vanilla pie" he had at a restraunt and how much he loved it...so i got on here to see if there was one listed and found this one.  Well it defintely passed the test!  I used 1 1/2 cans of the pie filling...but that's just because we love cherries!!  I have a feeling I will be making this recipe again!

Excellent flavor and texture!  I used a graham cracker crust instead of a pie crust.

This a wonderful pie, I have been making this desert for years, however I have substituted the vanilla pudding for cheesecake pudding and added a dash of pure vanilla extract. My family loves this desert

This was VERY good!  I doubled the recipe and made it in a 13x9x2 dish with excellent results.  Instead of a traditional crust I made a shortbread one (1 1/2 C Flour, 1 1/2 sticks of margarine, melted and 1/2 cup finely chopped pecans.  Stir together, then press into bottom of dish, bake at 350 for approx 20-25 min until edges start to brown, cool then proceed with recipe)  I would highly recommend that you do not be tempted to substitute the real whipped cream with non-dairy topping, as in my opinion that is one key ingredient that made the dessert so wonderful!   Try this one, you will not be sorry!

Excellent recipe. The flavor and texture was perfect. The only change I made was to use the entire can of cherry filling for the middle layer as I used a deep dish pie plate. It was still delicious and is one of my boyfriend's new favorites. Thanks for a great recipe.
