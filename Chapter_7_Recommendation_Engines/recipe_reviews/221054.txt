Very, very good.  What I like most about this 'company worthy' dish is that it can be prepped  entirely  ahead of time, cooked to order and looks fabulous.  BUT it really very easy.     As written this feeds more than 2 - more like 3 or 4. Enjoy this great recipe.

Made this dish as per recipe. AMAZING and looks like a lot more work than it really is. Once you have mastered the technique of poudning and wrapping the chicken, the possibilities are endless! SO worth the time!

This is a great recipe! I recommend this for everyone. I had to use cranberries instead of cherries and it still tasted amazing.  I would recommend at least doubling the filing because mine did not seem to have enough filing for my taste.

I stuck with the recipe but instead of proscuitto, I used bacon (store didn't have proscuitto), which made tying the strings a little more difficult, but it was worth it.  Was delicious and very fillling.  Will make again!

Wow!!! This was really tasty.  Depending on your palate you can add a few more cherries.  I am a parmasien cheese fan and added some to the top after cooking.  You can't go wrong with adding more stuffing to this dish.  Will def. cook this again.

Top notch recipe! Watch the video for step by step instructions; it really makes everything clear! Husband thought it was a tad too salty (which I didn't even do all the salt that was suggested). Used dry herbs (gasp)! 1/4 tsp each and baked on a small jelly roll type pan.  25 minutes was perfect; the sauce was delightful.  Served over rice pilaf. I will definitely make again!

My chicken turned out to be a little dry and needed more sauce. Probably the way I cooked it. However!!! It was so delicious especially the parts with extra sauce. I would definitely recommend this dish to people looking for a meal that looks and tastes delicious. Only recommendation is to cook extra sauce in case your chicken turns out dry. I will definitely cook this meal again!

I wanted to like this dish ,but the herbs in the stuffing distracted somewhat for me. Loved the cherries ,but the prosciutto was also a bit disappointing. I cannot justify keeping this recipe because it was it was little to labor intensive for such a so-so flavor.

Oh my oh my! Chef John has done it again. Excellence in taste and texture. Everybody enjoyed it, even our 6 and 10 year olds. (Great to make ahead and bake when the guests arrive!)

Awesome.   Made this for my hubby for our anniversary last night.  It was great.  Something so different and fairly easy.  How can you go wrong with prosciutto???  The cherry gave it a twist.  I doubled all ingredients except for the cherry and I was glad that I did not doube the cherry as there was plenty of cherry flavor.  I also left off the sauce at the end....I was just too tired, maybe next time.  Hubby thought it was excellent and "fancy".

I made this not to long ago and followed the recipe exactly - we loved it! However working with the proscuitto was a little frustrating with it being as fragile as it was, and I'm planning on trying bacon next time instead as I've seen some other people have done. I liked the cherries inside, but I think it might be better with crasins!

All in all, this is a fantastic recipe and easy to do with Chef John's instructions - I'll definitely be making this again!

This dish looks amazing. This was my first attempt at rolling stuffed chicken breasts and I found the video very helpful.  It was a bit time consuming to put this together but it was very good.  I had to cook it about 20 minutes longer than the time stated before it was done.

I made this last night for my guests they were very impressed.  Making it was messy the video made it look easier than it was,. I liked the fact I could make it ahead of time. I had no dried cherries so I had to use cranberries .

Used Italian cherries, "Ciliegie di'Vignola", drained, for the stuffing. I did add some pieces of cherries to the sauce. Couldn't help myself. Served w/haricot green beans & rice pilaf (see Chef John's Classic Rice Pilaf). I plated the rice pilaf in ramekins to mould and inverted it on the plates, garnished with sliced green onions. His stuffing can be used for beef or pork as well. I have also used his stuffing in my seitan. Thank you Chef John!

Made these for Valentines supper for my 10 yer old sweetheart and my husband. I so enjoyed the making of these, following Chef Johns video step by step, TRYING to accomplished what he did ever so carefully.  They were quite easy to make in the end. My husband like them, but I think the thyme was a little to much for my son's liking (and he eats most everything) so was a little sad it wasn't his favorite chunk of chicken,as he put it for a lack of better words. As for me I LOVED every bite  Only made one little change, used dried cranberries instead of cherries. I never knew my hands could make chicken look so pretty to eat!

This was very good.  I found the sauce had a bit of a tart taste so I added some apple jelly as I was reducing the liquids.
Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  Some observations: The two pieces of meat was far too much for the two of us; the sweetness of the cherries is very subtle; next time I will make a little less stuffing to ensure it all gets used up; also it took about 20 mins longer to cook than indicated in the recipe.
Lovely presentation. I served it with rice and broccoli spears.
Will make it again for sure.

I made this dish and it was delicious! My husband loved it. I have to say it does take some skill to get these ingredients to roll up. The video was very helpful. I tweaked the recipe a little because my husband doesn't like fruit in his stuffing. I used some prepared stuffing and crumbled Italian sausage because that's what I had around the house.  I found it hard to wrap the prosciutto around the chicken. I think the deli sliced it too thin and I didn't buy the expensive stuff. When I went to slice the rolls they kind of fell apart. I would definitely sear the roll-ups on both sides before baking them. The video shows this but I don't think the recipe mentions it.

I've made this two different ways and my family loved it each time.  The first time I made as instructed with the exception of using cherry flavored cranberries.  It was really good.  I then made it using a boneless turkey breast and subbing apricots and beef bacon.  The turkey was so moist and flavorful.  I have a love/hate relationship with balsamic vinegar so I only used half the amount and it was awesome.  I served it with whole wax beans and scalloped oysters.  Thanks Chef John!

Sounded great but was just so-so. Difficult to roll. Didn't really like the final textures.

This was fantastic! I did everything as written only I got thin sliced chicken so I would not have to pound it out. Since they are a little smaller, and I was cooking for 5 people, I had to make 10 small servings (two per person). It was extremely time consuming, but not difficult to do. Thanks so much Chef John!

OMGG! My husband and kids do not like "fruit" in their food. They absolutely LOVED this! They even asked when I was making it again! I found it extremely easy to make. I didn't use the butcher's string. I just placed the chicken, seam-side down, in the pan. AMAZING!

Really delicious. I used a pack of dried cranberries with walnuts (sold as a salad topping actually) instead of cherries and also added a few small dollops of Aloutte garlic and herb cheese spread to the stuffing mixture ((sold in small tubs near the deli at the grocery store). Cooked the chicken in the oven in my cast iron pans. It was SOOOO good. Attached is a before cooked picture.

While this is a terrific recipe as is, the mechanics of working with raw chicken breasts, filling and prosciutto was a test of my skills but I will try again to perfect the presentation of the meal. 
My wife was pleased with the meal although it was the day after  Valentines Day!

It is a wonderful recipe and the video made it that much easier to make. Very clever using cling wrap to keep the chicken roll in place while prepping other things. I substituted fresh mango for the dried cherries and it added a lively burst of taste to an already amazing stuffing made velvety by the egg yoke. It's truly scrumptious.

This was really yummy- and Chef John's video was a great help. i used the end of a 5 pound barbell to pound the chicken as I didn't have a meat mallet. Wrap it in a plastic baggie! I think dried cranberries would work just as well as the dried cherries, but it's up to the chef.

Made this as described. It was excellent. I appreciated learning the techniques  Chef John showed for stuffing and wrapping the chicken breasts. The plastic wrap hack was key!

WOW! This was so amazing that I am bummed I did not make more. It is the perfect size for 1 or 2 people and tastes so delicious. I made it with another www.allrecipes.com http://allrecipes.com/recipe/9377/roasted-vegetables/

The only change I made was that I did not tie it with string and I used dried spices instead of fresh because that is what I had on hand. It came out amazing and I will make this again and again.

This is easy and has very good flavor! I put the prosciutto on the inside because mine was thin and falling apart. Next time I would double the sauce because it was yummy! Highly recommend-husband had seconds and kids gave it a 9 out of 10!

My husband and I made this dish together.  It was very simple and we made some short cuts,  We used boxed stuffing and added on fruit.  It was simple, moist, and so yummy!!!  The "sauce" was so easy and added a great taste.  We used toothpicks to hold it together!  We will be making this again for sure!

Really enjoyed it. The video was a lot of help. Definitely easier than it looks. Well worth doing. You have to like vinegar and or basalmic to like the sauce. I did but my partner did not. I would rate it a 4.5 and would definitely make it again. I cooked it to about 155 because I don't like dry chicken. It was plenty cooked.

Really great dish, it was as impressive as it sounded.  I can see myself doing this again for company and for other special occasions. I found the video so helpful; I just followed it and it was pretty simple. I don't think I will add extra salt next time, the prusciutto add enough as well as the sprinkle inside the chicken. A great one to try.

I didn't have cherries so I used Craisins and also added slivered almonds. Amazing!!!

I used pork chops and stuffed them with the filling and then wrapped them in prosciutto.  Really delicious, but looked a little like an animal heart before I sliced it and put sauce on top.  Not complaining though - overall presentation was very good and I will definitely make this again.

Loved the dish but took me way longer to prepare than expected.  I don't know if I'm just a slow learner or had bad plastic wrap, but the whole process took me closer to two hours not including cook time.

Phew!  Thank God for Chef John's video which I used for hints on the rolling and prep.  Luckily it was for a special occasion (Valentine's Day) so I won't be making it again any time soon.  Great taste and presentation.

Excellent dish and a lot easier to make then I previously thought. I liked the taste with the sauce on top, it looked really pretty too once you put everything together on the plate. Would probably do it again ! Wonderful recipe.

Loved the flavours, the chicken cooked perfectly and was nice and juicy. Fantastic idea as a make-ahead for a dinner party. The recipe was a little more work than your basic week night dinner. Don't need the string as once you wrap with prosciutto it stays together fairly well.

I tried the Prosciutto-Wrapped Cherry-Stuffed Chicken Breasts for two last night for the first time, and it was terrific. We'll have it again at Valentines dinner with another guest. I added a second egg yolk to make the stuffing more moist and I plan to chop the cherries a bit to distribute the cherries' sweetness more evenly. Lots of fun to create this dish.- Arjay

Chef John, what can I say? You are a kitchen genius! This is the first recipe of yours I have tried and I can't wait to try all the others! I love watching your videos! I love chicken, and am constantly trying to find new ways to reinvent it! Thank you for posting such unique creations!

Took some time to make (but great to make ahead of time), but it was so juicy and tender and holy  it was good. I don't even like cherries, but it was still delicious. Made it for Valentines Day, thanks to Chef John's video commentary hahaha.

Really easy to pull off.  Substituted dried cranberries instead of cherries. Needed to cook longer than 25 minutes in my oven, and ended up broiling it for a few minutes afterwards.  The pieces that were broiled well, had a much more distinct taste, and the prosciutto was much more palatable.  Will definitely try this again.  Very easy, displays beautifully, and has great potential for customizing to your own palate.  Thanks a million for sharing this recipe.
