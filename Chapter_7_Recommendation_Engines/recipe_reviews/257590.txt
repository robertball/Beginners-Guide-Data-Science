Delicious! Bruschetta like garlic bread. I simmered garlic in oil on very low heat for 10 min as directed and result was a very flavorful oil. Only negative was directions state to add olive oil to tomato mixture. It wasnâ€™t clear if it was plain olive oil or leftover garlic oil from brushing bread. Bottom line- Family and I loved it.

What a great way to use up that left over bun that always seems to be hanging around without a hot dog to go into it! These made for a tasty appetizer for dinner tonight. Word of caution though . . . please DO NOT saute the crushed garlic for 10 minutes, or you will end up with bitter, burnt garlic! You only need to saute it for about 30 seconds to 1 minute, MAX! These remind me a lot of bruschetta. I'm knocking this 1 star for the bad directions on the garlic, but other than that - five star recipe!

Garlic bread is one of my favorite comfort foods. The marinara sauce is a bonus of flavor. This one's a keeper.
