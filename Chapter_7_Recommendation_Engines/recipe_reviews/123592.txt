I found this recipe in USA Weekend and tried it for breakfast. Neither me or my husband had ever eaten or heard of German pancakes and absolutely loved it.  I did not make the syrup because it didn't sound good to him, so we used pancake syrup.  Have made several times since then, and we both can eat the whole thing,so I would suggest increasing the ingredients for a larger family.  Tip, spray pan before putting in butter because mine stuck the time I forgot to spray.

This is the recipe I have been searching for!!  Just like my mom used to make for us growing up, but she called them "Dutch Babies."  Good plain, with just powdered sugar and butter.  Mmmmmmmmm!!

This was very good.  I reduced the sugar to 1 cup and it was still very sweet.  Use a large saucepan for the syrup because it might boil over otherwise!  I love German pancakes- and they are very easy to make.

This was delicious, both the pancake and syrup.  We had left over syrup and made the Pillsbury cinnamon rolls and poured all of the left over syrup, which was about a cup, into the pan of rolls while it just came out of the oven.  We ommited the frosting that comes with it and it was to die for...very very rich and delicious.  I have never had cinnamon rolls so good, thanks to this buttermilk syrup recipe.  Also, these pancakes are great with fruit and whipped cream for a different taste.

Veryyy good.  IMO, it's not at all like a pancake or bread, it's very eggy, like a very dense souffle, or thick french toast. Might be great with ham and cheese!  Did not make the syrup.  This would be a good egg-stretcher to save money at breakfast.

My mom used to make this for us all the time- it's delicious and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a change from the usual breakfast. But you MUST make the syrup too because the combination is senstational.

This is absolutely delicious and a close approximation of what I was looking for to recreate my Grandfather and Father's specialty. However, I used a glass Pyrex baking dish and the pancake stuck to the bottom, so I lightly buttered the pan the next time around and that worked out better.

I am rating only the pancake portion as I did not try making the buttermilk syrup. This pancake turned out much better than many I have tried, mostly because the butter did not brown the edges too much, so they weren't leathery and too brown/dry. HOWEVER, I did change a few things that might have influenced that.  1. Since I was using a nonstick dark baking pan I turned the oven down 25 degrees from the recommended temperature.  2. Because I've made this kind of pancake before I was surprised it didn't tell you to melt the butter in the pan, getting the pan hot. I did put the pan in the oven but cut the butter into little pieces and pulled it out pretty quickly so the butter didn't have a chance to brown. Then I swirled it over the surface, and immediately poured the batter in and set it back in the oven on the middle rack. (I liked that though this was a large recipe it didn't call for a huge amount of butter.) I topped mine with strawberries that I macerated in sugar (while it was in the oven) so there was a bit of sticky juice to pour about. Then I topped each serving with a dollop of whipped cream. It was a hit with everyone in the family, even the child who doesn't really like pancakes (of any kind) very much. (I'll try the buttermilk syrup next time but didn't have any buttermilk today.)

Excellent! The German pancake was delicious, the syrup was over-the-top incredible. Just a note, make the syrup in a very large saucepan! I started mine in a moderate-sized pan, and had to move it to a much larger pan to avoid a boil-over. Anyway, we'll be making this recipe again and again!

German pancake! I have never heard of a German pancake before. However I'm glad I tried it. My 19 month old son couldn't put his fork down. When he finished he pushed his plate in front of me and continued to repeat his new favorite word PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, until I got up and got him more. What a huge hit and it was such a simple recipe. I did take the advice of another person who suggested cutting the sugar down to a 1 cup instead of the 1 1/2 that the recipe calls for to make the syrup. I also do not keep buttermilk in the house. I used the advice from another person and used 1 cup milk & 1 tsp white vinegar and mixed it up to create my own butter milk. I then used 3/4 cup of that mixture. Anybody who makes this recipe and does not try this syrup is seriously missing out. It was great. It does make alot though. However with apple picking season here it's going to make a great apple dip. Thank you for your help everyone.

Fantastic breakfast!  This was a huge hit with everyone and it was easy to make!  I would serve with maple syrup or the delicious foamy sauce in the recipe.  We will make this again!

It was absolutely amazing. I added sugar, cinnamon and vanilla essence in the butter as I didn't make buttermilk syrup. but it came out really tasty. It will become our breakfast tradition! We ate it with maple syrup and peach. Yum!!

Perfect!  Just like my mom made (she called them Hobo Pancakes...not sure why...)  A trick we used was to stick the butter in the dish and pop it in the oven when it has a few minutes left of preheating.  It just saves a step!  (Watch that it doesn't burn the butter, though.)   Also, this syrup recipe is awesome!  I substituted one of the tsp. of vanilla with a tsp. of maple flavoring.  It would also be excellent as a dessert topping, like a caramel sauce!

I think this is a good recipe in that the result is just like the picture. However - I think it should be noted that this is in no way like a "pancake" - its pretty much just like yorkshire pudding which is served alongside savory dishes. For that reason alone I didn't care for it since I was expecting something different.

I liked this a lot! I cut the recipe in half for my boyfriend and I and it was still a lot! I didn't make the special syrup because I think regular syrup is good on its own. I ate this with apple chicken sausage, which I highly recommend!

Love this recipe! We eat this for lunch/supper with bacon and fruit. This is the same basic recipe as is served at The Pancake House (they offer 3 versions - plain, with apples, or ham/cheese). I made this as written the first time (the syrup is amazing, even with milk/vinegar instead of buttermilk). The second time I sprinkled cheddar cheese on top, and baked in a large bar pan instead of the 9X13 pan, which worked better (it didn't puff up so much on the edges, so was easier to cut and serve). Love the cheese version as well. I'll be making this often!

Yum!  Looked this up to make on a whim, and followed both recipes to a tee (with the exception of whole wheat flour) and soooo good.  I was skeptical about the syrup - but it seriously tastes like caramel sauce.

I wish I could give this recipe more than 5 stars. The pancake was delicious by itself and the syrup is absolutely phenomenal. I did leave it in for a couple minutes longer than stated and I sprayed my Pyrex pan with cooking spray before pouring in the butter. It slid right out with no sticking. Fantastic...going into regular breakfast rotation.

This was sooooo yummy!  I made it as written, including the syrup.  My family made mmmmm noises while eating it.  The syrup is a must, I now use it on french toast and pancakes as well.  This is most certainly a keeper.

5 stars for this! My first time ever making and having a German Pancake. This was super easy and so delicious, all 3 of my kids asked for seconds. The syrup is sooo good too. Will be adding this to our weekend breakfasts menus for now on, except maybe make 2 pans so we can all have seconds.

AMAZING!!! We'll definitely be making this again and the syrup alone for our Christmas Eve Waffles (family tradition).  Followed the recipe (only substituted skim milk with 1 t. lemon juice for buttermilk, as I never have it on-hand) and would recommend spraying the pan before putting the melted butter in.  Try it -- it's sure to be a hit! ;)

I made this today, and my family couldn't stop raving about it! It was so easy but so different from what we normally do. The syrup is TO DIE FOR. But, it's very sweet...next time I'll probably skip the dusting of powdered sugar and will just do the syrup. I also did not have buttermilk, but made my own by adding 1 T vinegar to 1 cup milk and let it sit for a few minutes.

Don't let the picture of the sauce deceive you!! I've had this recipe cut out of the magazine sitting in my book for almost 10 years and I was unusure if it was worth the effort.  The sauce is a rich caramel TWO CHANGES: 1.  Cut sugar down to 1 cup and 2. reduce margarine down to 1/4 cup.  You'll reduce fat and sugar without comprimizing the taste or consistency.

The syrup is delicious!  It's like caramel sauce. Although you have got to use a very large pan.  I had a medium saucepan in the beginning and it boiled over.  I suspect that's because of the baking soda.  I've been making German pancakes served with maple syrup, but this buttermilk syrup is the best and will be the one to use from now on.   I didn't have any buttermilk, so I used a buttermilk powder mix instead.  Everything else (including the pancake) was exactly the same.   I love German pancakes because they're so versatile and are a wonderful combination with sweet syrup.

This recipe is wonderful! The second time around I made a few changes--spray the pan first with some light cooking spray, then add butter and batter.  Also, make syrup in a large pan because it easily boils over even on low settings.  The combination is fabulous--my husband and I can eat the whole pan!  What a way to start the day!

What a yummy recipe!  The pancake bakes up so nice and light and fluffy - and it couldn't be easier to just throw the ingredients in the blender.  The syrup is great too, although it is basically a caramel sauce - it is very delicious.  I recommend making sure to use a larger pot to cook it in as it gets quite big and foamy when it boils.  Also my husband and I ate the whole pancake ourselves for Sunday breakfast - so I would guess in a larger crowd this would go fast.

This is like one big fantastic popover, and so quick and easy to make!!  My family adored the syrup!  2 tips: 1)spray pan with cooking spray before putting in the butter.  Despite the layer of butter in the bottom of the pan, mine still stuck. 2) Cook the syrup in a large saucepan or pot.  It expands a lot while it's cooking.  My family wants this for Christmas morning breakfast.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a spectacular recipe, both in taste and appearance.  It's quick and easy to put together and it tastes delicious.  The buttermilk syrup tastes like warm caramel and is the perfect topping for this dish.  I substituted freshly ground soft wheat flour to make it a bit healthier and sucanat for the sugar in the buttermilk syrup.  This will become a regular in our house.  The first portion was gobled up so quickly I had to make a second batch.  Fortunately one syrup recipe was plenty for both batches, with enough left over to dip some sliced apples in.

I was looking for a pancake recipe and this is the one that I found where I actually had all the ingredients for so I decided to try it. My husband and I fell in love with this recipe! Though I cook it in the frying pan, it is still delicious! My husband will beg for these any time of day, and since they are so good I just cannot resist.

I have tried quite a few German pancake/Puff Pancake recipes and this one has turned out the BEST! I did add some vanilla and cinnamon and baked it in a 13x9 glass baking dish. I do tend to think that you have to bake it for longer than what is listed, but this is maybe just how my oven bakes. Definitely a keeper....

delicious :) slied bananas and layered them in the middle of the batter.  Had to use silk soy creamer since we ran out of milk....was great...think 2o minutes is a minimum...may have been a good idea to leave in for another minute or two

I say forget the syrup.  After baking, top with powdered sugar, lemon juice and melted butter.  By using these toppings and not syrup, you have made a dish that is unique from a regular pancake.  Try it, you will see what I mean!

Loved this recipe! Very easy to make and tastes fantastic. Instead of syrup, I like to use honey butter. Basically, it's melting butter and adding however much honey you want to taste. A sweet option for breakfast

I was in the mood for German pancakes and this one not only met my expectations it exceeded them further than I thought possible. I never knew that German pancakes were that EASY! I didn't make the buttermilk syrup cause I don't like buttermilk. Instead I added powdered sugar and lemon juice and my mother and I ate the entire recipe it was just to darn good. I would say that 8 servings is pushing it I would say its closer to a three servings or like five if you are having it more as a side dish. (I didn't plan well and had this recipe for the only thing for breakfast)  A TOTAL KEEPER!!!!!!!

Very Delicious pancakes.  I boiled the buttermilk syrup for 7 minutes and it caramelized. It's a tastey dipping for apples now! Next time I know if it starts to darken, it's ready. :)

This is so yummy! We have had them two days in a row! Instead of melting the butter, I just rub softened butter all over the pan and spray a little bit of cooking spray. Yesterday, I melted the butter and the pancake stuck to the pan. Today was much better, using softened butter. My husband's grandma is German, so I asked what else to serve this pancake with besides the buttermilk syrup (didn't have buttermilk on hand). I was told to use plain or cinnamon applesauce. It was delicious and a plus because it was healthier!

I've made this a few times now, and it's very easy and extremely delicious.  I skipped the buttermilk syrup, however, and used real maple syrup.

I was disappointed with this recipe and I LOVE German Pancakes! I didn't make the syrup because I like them best with just a bit of powdered sugar on top, but I found the pancake to be too egg-y. It also took almost 40 minutes to bake. At 30 minutes the batter was still full of runny eggs. It looked pretty disgusting. Once it cooked it was tolerable but I won't bother making it again. My Better Homes and Garden cookbook has a much, much tastier recipe!

This is a great recipe - Simple and delicious. I did not use the syrup recipe, and I baked this in a 12" cast iron skillet.  I dusted with powdeed sugar and served straight from the skillet with homemade jam. Will definitely make again.

I made this German pancake and the buttermilk syrup for a surprise birthday brunch for my sister (who is very fussy) and it was a huge hit!  Served it with a fresh fruit cup, gourmet sausages and naturally champagne cocktails.

Oh WOW!! This is GREAT!! The syrup is almost a carmel sauce...I didn't have buttermilk so I  substituted plain yogurt.  The kids LOVED both!! My husband made the pancake while I worked on the syrup.  How fun!!! Thanks for the recipe!!!  Goes great with morning jazz and a mimosa.  Not very 'German' but very 'fusion' :)

This recipe brought back my childhood memories. I love this recipe! I don't use syrup on it. Instead, I sprinkled confection sugar on it and squeeze lemon juice over it. (Not too much ~ it'll make it soggy.) It's simply divine . . . mmmm . . .

We just had this for breakfast and it was great. I wasn't going to make the syrup because we had just gotten 'real' maple syrup, but decided to make it anyway. I am so glad I did. I can see myself pouring it over ice cream or something. Yummy! I also added 2 T. sugar to the pancake and 1 t. vanilla. Even my kids (11,9,6 & 2) who don't really care for pancakes loved this. Thanks.

I made this recipe once and my family loved it.  Now my husband makes it almost every weekend.  A little time consuming, but great results!  We use the extra sauce on French Toast and ice cream.

The reason I made this was simply because we are broke and out of food until payday. I had everything and gave it a go. It was fantastic. My husband raved about it. I didn't have the ingredients for the syrup so I just made the basic pancake. Then I topped it with regular pancake syrup. SO GOOD! I followed the reviewer's advice who said that if you baked it in a dark pan to bake it at 375 and I also sprayed it with baking spray to prevent it from sticking. I can't believe how quick it came together. I also have a feeling that my egg hating 3 year old is going to gobble this up. So now I also have a way of getting protein in him in the morning! Thank you so much for this recipe!

These were delicious and very simple to make.  I've had them before and they were a sweeter version.  I might add a little bit of sugar next time, but they are still wonderful as written.  I used a jelly roll style pan, and shortened the cooking time by a couple minutes.

This was quick, very pretty and tastes amazing! You could serve this to guests at brunch and deliver that "wow" factor (comes out of the oven puffy, golden brown and smelling divine). It's so easy, I throw it together to give my kids when they comes in hungry from playing in the snow. I add a bit of vanilla to the batter and top with Nutella or strawberry jam, but syrup works too. Will be making this many many times!

WOW!!!!  I've had many versions of German Pancakes in my life, but none that tops this.  It was also much easier with the blender prep.  I didn't realize the syrup had an entire stick of butter in the recipe until it was too late.  After I tasted it, I realized it was worth every bit of bad health . . .  Simply amazing!

This pancake is fantastic!  It tastes just like the ones at The Pancake House, except you spend a fraction of the cost.  I have not made the buttermilk syrup as of yet since no one in my family eats the pancake with syrup.  It's sweet enough with just the powdered sugar on it.

This is freaking delicious.  Seriously.  My husband and I love german pancakes and, in our recent move to South Korea, lost our recipe.  I found this one to try and, because we're low on maple syrup, decided to try the buttermilk syrup as well.  It was amazing.  Seriously, I think I might have died a little bit inside (in a good way).  I made the pancakes exactly as written, but cut the syrup recipe down to 1/4 the volume, left out the corn syrup and baking soda and used plain yogurt in place of the buttermilk (didn't have it on hand).  So, I guess I changed it quite a bit (wasn't really thinking about it at the time), but it was still AWEsome.  On the whole, I will be making this again.  Maybe tomorrow and then maybe every day after that, too.. Yeah, I think I'll go ahead and hide the scale now.....

I really liked this.  We made it in an extra large  cast iron skillet.  It puffed up beautifully.  We sprinkled with powdered sugar and topped it off with cinnimon apple slices cooked in a simple syrup. My kids, who have never had a german pancake before, thought it was too eggy for their tastes. I'd make it again though.

Wow! German Pancakes are pretty simple and I've made them before but I didn't have recipe so I used this one. Turned out just as expected! Delicious. However, it took me a while to get the courage to make the buttermilk syrup. I happen to have some leftover buttermilk and I didn't want to waste it so I figured we'd try to make the syrup and if it was gross then oh well at least we used the buttermilk. WOW. The syrup was amazing! It is this really rich caramel flavor and it's to die for! Everyone in my house loved it even our picky eater!  I did not have any corn syrup but after reading some other reviews I was confident that I could do without it. I have already shared the recipe with my mom and my best friend! It's worth trying for sure just remember to constantly stir it otherwise it will boil over!

My son is allergic to dairy so I had to substitute rice milk for the milk (I used rice milk and vinegar for the buttermilk) and vegan margarine for the butter, and the pancake and syrup still turned out perfectly!  It is hard to find recipes that are still good after a non-dairy substitute, so we'll be using this one often.  My two very picky little boys ate it right up.  Next time I will have to double the recipe so there's enough for dad too!

This was great!  I didn't have buttermilk, but made a buttermilk equivalent by combining 1 c. milk with 1 T. vinegar, and letting that sit for 10 minutes before using.  Definitely spray the pan with cooking spray as well.  The combination of the pancake with the syrup was so good.  I have been looking for a good German pancake recipe for a long time and this definitely is a keeper!

Loved this recipe! I omitted the corn syrup from the the Buttermilk Syrup recipe though. It was fantastic and certainly did not lack for sweetness!

This is NOT a recipe for pancakes.  It is supposed to be like a really thick crepe.  Sooo yummy!  I made the syrup without the corn syrup and it was fine.  I added a mixed berries on top.  Perfect.

The only reason I am giving the recipe 4 * is because the pancake was a bit on the eggie I think the egg taste was a bit much for a pancake but the sauce I will give 10stars if I could it is simply delicious but what I did is I toild everyone it was an egg cake with buttermilk sauce to prepare them before they began to eat all in all the was a good recipes

This is wonderful either as dessert or for breakfast.  For all of you, who like me, hesitated to make the syrup, hesitate no longer!  It is yummy!  My hubby insisted that I make sure to save the recipe!  I didn't use corn syrup because I didn't have it.  All the kids love it as well!

This was so good!  The texture was different than my family expected - more like a dense custard.  We topped it with a sprinkle of powdered sugar and some blueberries and raspberries.  The syrup is SOOOO yummy - tastes like butterscotch sauce.  Can't wait to try it over cinnamon rolls!

This is very good as is.  I have made it several times since finding it.  I do now add 1/4 cup of sugar to it for a bit of sweetness.

One of my favorite foods ever! The pancakes are so easy to make and the ingredients are so simple I always have everything on hand. The flavor of the pancake is almost sweet. Always a crowd pleaser! I have not tried the syrup recipe but I plan to!

These are to die for! I was really worried about the syrup so I only made half of it. To my surprise, the pancakes tasted divine with the syrup. The vanilla extract really covered up the sour cream/spoiled milk taste of the buttermilk. So good even my husband ate breakfast. From now on, I will make only half the syrup because the pancakes don't need to much on them to get the sweet taste. Did I already mention I loved the buttermilk syrup? You really have to try it.

Yummy, but not quite what I was expecting.  Mine came out very dense and smooth, almost like a very firm custard.  I was expecting it to puff up a bit more, but that may have been because my oven wasn't completely preheated when I put the pan in (it only takes about 2 minutes total to crack eggs, measure, mix, and pour).  Both of my small boys are inhaling it.  I'll definitely try this again and either let it bake a little longer or double check the oven temperature.  I melted some butter over top and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar.

instead of confectioner's sugar, I baked it with thinly sliced apples and cinnamon sugar on top!  delightful.
don't use a small saucepan for the syrup - the baking soda makes it rise, bubble up, and fizz fizz fizz.

My husband hated this. He said it was too egg-like and really rubbery. It probably should be served right away, as mine got more rubbery as breakfast time wore on. Hope others have more success than I did, as I'm sure it would be a unique addition to your breakfast repetoire.

These are the best. I was given a recipe like this but it was called Dutch Babies and I had lost it. So I was very happy to find this. All our company loves these and wants them made when they come to visit. So thank you. These are all good for dinner with and little bacon and eggs and for dessert with some ice cream on top.

This was a terrific recipe.  I made them for Mother's Day.

I did not make any syrup, but instead I served them with lemon wedges, powdered sugar and fresh raspberries. I added a little vanilla and a few tablespoons of sugar to the egg mixture.  Everyone raved.  I did not notice an "eggy" taste at all.

It was really good. I kept on looking for a easy but good recipe for German Pancakes. I changed it just a little bit. Instead of using teh buttermilk syrup i squeezed fresh lemon juice on the pancakes and then sprinkled powdered sugar on it.

German pancakes are a great solution for Sunday brunch,or for company. So impressive! I make mine without eggs most of the time, especially if I am going to use a topping. They puff up just as nice, and they are equally impressive.

The dh raved and raved about the syrup. He is extremely picky when it comes to condiments. He did not think it was possible to make great tasteing homemade syrup and was pleasantly shocked. The german pancake recipe is one we have used for years. I sometimes put butter, lemon juice and powder sugar on top of the pancake when it comes out of the oven. It is good with syrup or yogurt and I have even cooked it with bacon, mushrooms and cheese.

This was a little a different from a recipe I used to have but it worked great and tasted great too!  I sprayed the pan first with cooking spray just to make sure it didn't stick.  The buttermilk syrup was soooo awesome.  The longer you cook it, the darker it gets.  Mine ended up tasting alot like caramel sauce and I saved the rest of it for ice-cream.

We loved this recipe.  I will definitely again.  I will use a little less vanilla next time though.  I use Mexican vanilla and it is very strong.  We also added blueberries on the pancake and poured syrup over them and it was wonderful.

Just made this for dinner and it was wonderful!  The syrup really makes the dish.  And it's nice to have all the ingredients on hand. It's quick, simple, and great.  My husband said it should be our new Sunday breakfast, but it's really an 'anytime' meal. Thanks for the recipe!

This is so yummy and easy! It's great plain, with powdered sugar, honey butter, or jam. My favorite is blackberry jam personally. My friends really liked this too and went back for seconds.

I thought this was great! I followed one suggestion for increasing the amount by 1/3 to 9 eggs/1 and 1/3 cups each of flour and milk and appreciated the note that told to watch for browning of the syrup. I used Altern (spenda alternative) in place of sugar and everything still came out well. 1 year old to 55 year old love it!!

I thought it was a great recipe. I made it for a crew leaving early in the a.m. I did add sugar and vanilla, though, because it tasted a little bland. The syrup was wonderful.

use it for the syrup recipe--AWESOME!
But take it off the stove after 6 minutes and stir it or it will get too brown.

This is a family favorite!  Fast, easy, and delicious!  I just dump all the ingredients for the pancake into the blender, run it for about 30 seconds and pour into the pan and bake.  It doesn’t get any easier!

My family loves these.  I add a little cinnamon on top with the powdered sugar.

Awesome, my kids like these better than traditional pancakes.  I usually substitute 2 whole eggs with 4 egg whites.  The sauce is the best part.

This is now our family Saturday morning breakfast. It's so delicious!! We don't use the syrup instead we top it with powdered sugar.

I made this while we had company for breakfast.  The syrup on this was fantastic!!!  We're planning to make it for second day in a row.

I know just about everybody LOVED this pancake, but we are used to a thinner, lighter pancake. This is very egg-y, so be prepared. It wasn't to our preference, so I wouldn't make it again. I tried the syrup and made the mistake of putting the vanilla in at the beginning....the syrup came out much like a caramel sauce and was a little too sweet for me, but my 14 yo son loved it. We'll prob finish it off on ice-cream. SO, if you don't want caramel, be careful to put the vanilla in later!!

I love a German pancake and this recipe is fool-proof.  The syrup is very rich and delicious with a caramel-like flavor.  I have actually made the syrup and served it over pies and desserts, which seems to work well.

This is so good! It's great for dinner too. My husband sometimes wants it to be more "substantial", so I'll occasionally alter the recipe to 8 eggs and 1 1/3 cup each of flour and eggs. It really seems to make a difference - makes the pancake thicker. My kids love it either way, and there are never leftovers!

This was alright...but i didn't use the recipe syrup, just regular maple syrup...would have given the pancake 3 stars but since i didn't use recipe syrup gave it 4....it was just a little eggy for me, but my kids liked it.
