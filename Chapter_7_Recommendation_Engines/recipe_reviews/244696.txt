So nice to have this on all recipes! This was perfect for my skillet cornbread!

The recipe calls for 15 tablespoons of cornmeal. Since there are 16 tablespoons in a cup, I just filled a whole cup with cornmeal and used a measuring spoon to remove 1 tablespoon instead of counting out 15.

Works perfectly! I left out the salt because my recipe already called for it. Thank you for the recipe.
