We were wanting some spicy chicken...this was really good, did not change the recipe but did not "measure" ingredients! The dish was still juicy & delicious! I paired it with poblanos & mexican rice...mmmmm! =-)

This recipe was easy, low calorie and delicious!  I did adjust the heat level by using just 1/2 tbsp of cayenne and I only had Frank's hot sauce on hand but that worked out fine as well.  I will be making this spicy chicken again!

I made this last night using habenero sauce for my hot sauce.  This is a super hot sauce, and I used the same amount as recommended for twice as much chicken.  It was still too much!  I will use the leftovers for tacos and cut the spice with cheese, etc.  It came out very moist and the texture was great, but it was too hot - and we love hot food!  Pay better attention than I did to the type of hot sauce you use.

Absolutely delicious!!!  I made some minor changes based on others advice.  I doubled the brown sugar and only used 1/2 Tbls of the cayenne.  For added tang and zip I splashed in about a Tbls of apple cider vinegar, not sure if it changed it much but it had a nice tang to it.   I used boneless chicken thighs and then shredded it for soft tacos, it was so tender.  My teenage son loved it and said it could even be spicier so next time I may just go for the whole Tbls!  Great recipe!!

A good authentic mexican taco sauce is key to this delicious chicken. I used Rosarita- salsa taquera which is as authentic as you can get from the store (in my opinion) Now the salsa you want to use is not the same kind you use to dip your chips in. This is more of a taco sauce, the kind where you can see all the seeds from the ground up chili peppers. (hope you all know what im talking about ;) My salsa was very hot so i reduced the amount of cayenne by more than half and im glad i did. This was very good! I basted frequently and broiled for the last 5 mins or so. Delicious!

1.  The sauce will never thicken.  Chicken thighs have a lot of fat and fat drippings do not thicken when cooked.
2.Sauce was good, right amount of spice.
3.Bone in chicken thighs cook longer than 40 minutes at 400 degrees.  Besides, who actually eats 1 chicken thigh for dinner?  Our chicken was still red and bleeding near the bone.  Cook for an hour at 400.  Also, the skin was soggy and a little slimy, which is another reason to cook them longer.

This was grub! We used the leftover chicken for tacos the next night. My guy suggested using our homemade habanero hot sauce. "No", the reviews said habanero was too much. Thank goodness for reviews. They help you to adapt w/ what you have. So, we used a coupla 1/2 bottles of hot sauce plus some some homemade thai pepper hot sauce. We skinned our chicken leg quarters, basted them shortly after removing foil cover, w/ sauce from bottom of dish (thickening nicely). Our 4 leg quarters were big so we doubled the sauce, but only used 2 tablespoons of cayenne for sauce, used 4 tablespoons of brown sugar. Next time, will use a bit more cayenne, and less brown sugar. We steamed some brown rice and there was enough left over to make lunchbox burritos and taco dinner the next day.

almost gave this 5 stars if only for the fact that it nearly took my hubby's head clean off -- and he considers himself a hot&spicy heavtweight! will definitely make again but will turn down the heat level (a tad for us, alot for "mere mortals"). quick, simple and loads of fun.

Fixed this tonight.  Boyfriend loved the sauce!  Now he wants me to make the sauce for other things.  He likes wings so I'll try it on wings next time.

So easy!  I used bone-in, skinless thighs and Valentina hot sauce - followed recipe exactly.  Quite spicy and very tender.  I served with long grain brown rice + sauteed vegetables (carrots, onion, zuch, corn, chickpeas ...)  Will make again and again. Great recipe with only 5 ingredients!

Yummy!!  It was quick, it was easy, and it definitely cleared my sinuses!  I made it with boneless, skinless chicken thighs then I followed the directions exactly (expect I used a different brand of Mexican-style hot sauce since I already had it in my cupboard).  I made some brown rice and put some of the extra sauce on it.  l will absolutely make this recipe again!

This was excellent! I used Tapatio because that's my husband's favorite and let it marinate all day. It was very good and super spicy. I loved it and, more importantly, my husband loved it!

this was a great and easy recipe to make and delicious to eat!  i used chicken leg quarters which required a longer cooking time than in the recipe - i also omitted the brown sugar and added a little taco seasoning mix just for the heck of it.  overall - amazing!  will definitely make again because it was quick and easy and tasted awesome!

I doubled the recipe the first time I made it and 2 tablespoons of cayenne was way too hot!  Next time I made it using a tablespoon even for the doubled recipe and it came out great.  Still very spicy, but good.

Made this about a week ago. Went easy on the cayenne, about a third of a TBsp. The wife thought it might be too hot, it was not. Next time I will go with a bit more then half a TBsp see how that goes. Everyone liked this, it is a definite repeat.

Made it again. The wife had steak, she does not like too spicy, so her son and I ate shared it.
The sauce does not thicken up for me for some reason. This is the third time I have made it and the sauce always comes out like soup, although I have not tried a higher temp or longer cook time or both. I think I will try a higher temp when I make it next week.

I had a chicken breast out for my lunch and decided to try this. I halfed the sauce recipe, and left out the paprika (i keep forgetting I'm out!) It was really great - I toasted a sesame bun, put some ranch dressing on it and made a chicken sammich. REALLY yummy. I want to try this with bone-in chicken on the grill! I used Crystal hotsauce (the best) and I added a few shakes of garlic powder.

I'm making this for the second time (in a month) tonight.  I positively love how you can change up the spice and sweetness and its so super easy!  I mix all my ingredients in one big bowl and just dip the chicken through it then pour all the remaining sauce on top.  I double the hot sauce and brown sugar and keep all other measurements the same (I usually make 8 pieces at a time).  I cook it in a glass covered pyrex baking dish then uncover it for the last 25 mins.  This is definitely a keeper for a quick easy meal.  Tonight I'm making it with legs.

This recipe turned out pretty good.  I was happy with the amount of spice-- made my lips burn a bit, so that was great!  I expected the spicy sauce to penetrate the chicken a bit more (if I have cooked more chicken in the past, I probably would've known not to expect this), but it turned out to just coat the skin.  I might make it again, although I'd be interested in getting the sauce to penetrate the chicken some more.  Made it for my husband and a couple friends and they loved it!

Had to use Frank's hot sauce, as it was what I had. Also cut the cayenne pepper to 1 tsp. It was plenty hot. Will make again with mexican hot sauce to see the difference, but was wonderful, none the less.

This was a hit at my house.  I used a combination of hot sauce and taco sauce, I was trying to keep the spice down a bit so the kids would eat it.  And they loved it!  Luckily I made a triple batch of legs and thighs because four pieces wouldn't have been nearly enough.  I've made it several times since, and I don't measure, just dump it all in a bowl and roll the chicken around in it before baking.  Delicious!

Awesome!  I did not change a thing but increasing the amount of chicken and sauce.  I put 8 small, boneless, skinless chicken thighs in an 8x8 baking dish.  For the last 5 minutes or so I flipped them over to really immerse them.  Paired with Mexican Rice III on allrecipes and corn cake - spectacular!

This was good.  Not great, but good flavor.  Personally, I'd prefer to see this sauce used as a chicken wing sauce as opposed to baking the chicken thighs in it.  I'm picky with thighs and (if not BBQing) always cut, pull, and wash away as much as the fat as possible.  Even then, as someone else mentioned, when making as directed, the sauce was too diluted with fat from the chicken (and I was particularly careful with these).  We did scale cayenne down to 1/2 T and I threw in a little honey along with the brown sugar (about a tsp or so).  We ended up removing from the sauce, separating the fat from the sauce, then brushed more of the remaining sauce on top while running under the broiler to crisp it up a bit.

This is great!!!!  So few ingredients but such HUGE flavor!  I just happened to have the Valentina sauce the recipe suggest and I think it's perfect.  The recipe should suggest to serve with rice (which I just happened to make) to serve with the delicious sauce left in the pan.  Very spicy though, but we loved it!  Thanks ;)

Loved it because I love spicy food and actually didn't think it'd be spicy enough for me. It definitely was, just felt like it was missing something, so I dipped it in some fat-free ranch, which cooled it down a little and made it taste even more delicious!

This turned out really good! I used two leg quarters and removed the skin and as much fat as possible. I did not grease the pyrex dish and it didn't need it. The only thing I changed with the recipe was leaving out the paprika because I was out. It was still really good. Because quarters are bigger than thighs alone I cooked it under foil for 30 minutes, then removed the foil and baked another 20 minutes. Then I turned off the oven but didn't take it out for maybe another five minutes while I was getting the veggies ready. I had a hard time leaving the second piece and not eating it right up, but I want to make tacos from the leftover meat!

Woah this is spicy! I had 8 chicken thighs and doubled the sauce. BUT I only put in 1/2 tbsp. cayenne pepper. I couldn't imagine it full strength. I also always pull the skin off before baking. I thought it turned out delicious, but the fiancé thought it was too spicy. (After the first two bites, he went to the bathroom and grabbed a prilosec!) Served it with Spicy Spanish Style Rice by Chef John from this site. A great supper!

Awesome. I rarely find recipes spicy enough for my gf, but this one fit the bill. I had a beer on hand to drown the spice. :) Made this slightly different, I browned the thighs in a cast-iron skillet, poured the sauce over, and baked them uncovered in the skillet. Had a thermometer on them and it took about 20 minutes in the oven that way. I boiled down the sauce after I took the skillet out of the oven and poured it back over the chicken (and over some couscous and corn I'd made).

So quick to prepare with a tasty result.  Quite spicy, but we liked it that way.  The flavors remind me of hot wings.

I have made this twice. I use Valentina hot sauce which I recommend, the only modification I make is I double the brown sugar. I use boneless skinless thighs, usually six to a pack. I bake them 20 minutes covered then 10 uncovered at 400. This dish is absolutely delicious, I like to serve it with Knorr dirty rice or taco rice. Excellent dish all the way around, thank you for submitting it

You must use Mexican hot sauce.  If you use Franks or Tabasco or something else, then you're not making the same dish.  I use Valentina Mexican hot sauce which is avalaible at most grocery stores in the hot sauce section.  Its thicker than normal hot sauces and taste different as well.

The taste great as is.  It is very hot though.  On the mild, medium, hot scale this is extra hot.  Do yourself a favor and use fresh paprika.  If yours has been sitting in the pantry for 3 years then its probably bad.  Taste it, if it taste bitter and stale then buy some more.

As I said this recipe taste great as is, but it is also a great place to start if you like to tweak recipes.  Its too hot for my wife so i reduce the cayenne pepper to 1 tsp and I double the sugar because we both like this sweet.  I've also made this with with just 1 tablespoon of chipotle powder and left the paprika and cayenne out.

For only 4 chicken thighs the hot sauce PLUS 1 tablespoon each of cayenne and paprika is way too MUCH !! is that a type-O ? should be 1 tea spoon of each !!!!!!! and 2 or 3 table spoons of brown sugar .

I used part Chilulo and part Frank's Red Hot plus doubled the brown sugar.  Had a bit of kick but not too much.  I may go spicier next time but this was a very simple and easy recipe.  Yum!

I followed the recipe as is. It was a little on the spiceier side. It was good, but the sauce didn't thicken as I intended it would. If I would try this recipe again, I would add additional brown sugar.

This is easy & delicious!  I did adjust cayenne down to 1tsp for my tastes, still plenty hot for me.  I used my instant pot to cook & it made the chicken tender & seasoned all thru meat. Paired it with saffron rice.

I adjusted this just a little.   I used Chili Sauce as my base and then added other types of hot sauces such as Sriracha, Tapatio, and Tabasco to add up to the 1/2 cup of hot sauce.    It was the perfect sweet followed by a nice hot kick!

My family likes spicy, but not a lot of heat. So I used 1/2 the amount of hot sauce, only @1tsp of cayenne and added an additional 1tsp of brown sugar, and also 1tsp of apple cider vinegar.  Baked 20 minutes covered, 35 minutes uncovered and lowered the heat to 275 and cooked covered. 

The sauce didn’t thicken but it had just enough heat and was ever so juicy. This was a really quick and easy dish to fix. Will definitely make again.

This was delicious and super easy with a few modifications.  I used chicken drumsticks instead of chicken thighs. I only did a teaspoon of the cayenne pepper because I used a mix of spicy  taco sauce and hot sauce, and I doubled the brown sugar to balance out the heat.  I didn't have paprika and didn't miss it.  I put the chicken drumsticks in a ziplock bag and poured the sauce mixture over them and shook it well - if I plan ahead next time I will marinate it for at least a few hours.  I cooked it for closer to an hour and broiled it at the end to crisp the skin up a bit. The chicken was VERY flavorful and juicy, served with rice and black beans.  Will definitely make this again!

My wife and I both enjoyed this spicy dish; we like spice.  I substituted chicken breast, about 2 lbs because it was on sale, and doubled the sauce.   We used the left overs for chicken fajitas later in the week.

Absolutely delicious. I was at first skeptical about the recipe but not anymore. I was nervous about it being to spicy so I used red pepper instead of cayenne. I also squeezed a little fresh lime over the chicken. So so good. Served it with the Mexican bean salad found on this site and roasted baby red potatoes? with lime and garlic. YUM

I wanted hot wings, and I used this recipe.

I marinated the wings. I cooked them on low on the BBQ for  ~45 minutes, turning often. Early in the cooking, I brushed some more of the marinade onto the meat. (don't do this at the end, you don't want uncooked marinate on your meat) 
They turned out tasty!

Wow!  Spicy and amazingly tasty!  I could not find the Valentina sauce in Canada, so I used La Costeña Taquera Sauce instead.  I also replaced the brown sugar with coconut sugar.  I served the chicken with plain rice and fresh avocado slices.  This meal tasted great and very fresh, but it was much spicier than I anticipated.  My husband loved it, but I think we would both prefer a slightly less fiery meal, so I will aim to add less cayenne next time.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This is a very easy and tasty chicken dish.  I made it exactly as listed but my husband, who loves spicy food, thought there was a little too much heat.  I will make this again and maybe cut back on the cayenne pepper and increase the brown sugar slightly.  Also, I'm going to follow some of the suggestions to get the sauce to thicken up plus increase the baking time.  My chicken was still raw close to the bone with only the 40 minutes listed.  But overall this is a delicious recipe.

Tasty but the reason for my so-so rating is probably because I used the 'extremely hot' Valentina sauce. I love hot but that was too much... next time I'll use the 'not extremely hot' sauce lol

I made this for my dad and it was great. I followed the recipe exactly, but for the hot sauce in the sause, I combined red hot, sriracha, and mild taco sauce. (I had multiple kinds of hot sauce and didn't know what to choose.) The only reason I rated it 4 stars instead of 5, is that it needed to be cooked for longer. The sauce thickened fine, it was just that the chicken wasn't cooked all the way through. I suggest 40 minutes instead of 20. I will definitely make this again, but cooking it for longer.

I used the  Valentina's hot (not extra hot) and equal parts honey and molasses (about 1.5 Tbsp total) in place of the brown sugar.  I also used chipotle flakes in place of cayenne and added about .25 tsp cinnamon.   Great flavor and not too hot.

Along with the chicken thighs I used breasts, wings  and drumsticks  and it was awesome.   I've already recommended this recipe to my family and friends and will be using it for Super  2017.  THANKS!!!!

I made this with Boneless skinless chicken. It was great. I used frank's sauce because that is all I had. It was quite spicy for my teenage kids but my husband and I loved it.

I loved this recipe. It was so easy and simple that I can't wait to make it again. Luckily I had all the ingredients on hand (which was a shocker in and of itself).  This will be a go-to favorite from now on.

Since I had run out of cayenne, I added chili powder and it tasted great. I'll definitely make this again.

The amount of brown sugar made it too sweet for hubby and daughter, so I'll cut some of it back.

Made this last night and hubby and I both enjoyed it. We did have rice with it to tame it a bit. We also cut the cayenne in half. Going to try the same mixture with pork. Bet that would be good too.

Recipe looked very spicy, so I halved the hot sauce, 1/6th of the paprica and cayenne, and doubled the brown sugar. Used 2 chicken breast halves instead of 4 thighs. The sweetness and medium heat was perfect.

Very good!   I made a bigger amount without increasing the hot spices and increasing sugar.   For people who expect  to have flavor penetrate to the center of any meat, I strongly suggest an injector syringe available at kitchen shops, which will put your marinades, etc. right into the meat.  Worth the cost and will last forever...mine has been used 10 years.

I have made a similar dish. I used boneless, skinless  thighs.

In the crockpot place chicken thighs, 1 pt. medium salsa,
add salt, garlic to taste.

Cook for about 6 hrs.  Serve with rice, noodles or use for tacos.

Love the flavor and spice of this recipe. I would like the sauce to be a little thicker so I could dip the chicken in it. Will try chicken breast next time as I'm not a huge fan of chicken thighs -thanks for a great tasting recipe!!

Made this in the June Carolina heat, doubled the recipe, dipped each piece of a separated chicken quarter (5)  baked in pyrex 9x 12 for 1 hour @ 400 turned halfway, oh covered with cookie sheet cause I was out of foil, noticed too much darkening so turned. Yes because of dark meats sauces did not thicken!  Over all I'd do this again on the grill! This is fantastic!

I'm always on the look out for simple and delicious recipes. This recipe was spot on. I followed the recipe exactly and only had to change the cooking time. To get the proper internal temp it took 45 minutes. Other than that, it was perfect, low cost and delightful. The baking takes away some of the heat from the sauce, which is good because I tried just a little of the sauce while putting it on the chicken and it was hot. Overall, the chicken was very delicious.

Loved it!  Followed recipe exactly except used a combo of thighs and legs, bone-in and with skin.  Served sauce over plain white rice with a little grated cheddar cheese on top.  I didn't find it to be too spicey.  Next time I might try boneless. Also, if preparing for guest, I think I would serve along with some pico de gallo, guacamole, shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes, and grated cheddar and mozzarella cheeses.  That would help tone it down for those that don't like things as spicey as some of us.  Also, I will double the sauce next time.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

We love this and make it often.  I use Cholula hot sauce which has a great flavor and follow the rest of the recipe.  One thing is that I've never had the sauce thicken like the picture, but it is still delicious.  We serve it with mexican rice and a corn, pepper and onion saute.

I'm the type to like to try new things I made this but I  added a few minor details I made chicken thighs and drumsticks people don't be afraid to try new things. Think outside the box!!! My family Is very big on favor so I found this dish lacking a bit of that. I added all the ingredients but I didn't go by measurements I went by how much was tolerant and when tasting as I went on. I actually tripled the brown sugar I know that's not good for oh well. As I was making an over spicy chicken I went tasting as a continued,  I added a bit of wine to distract the over spicy taste. I'm weird I know anywho I added touch of seasoning just sprinkle a bit. Before anything I preheated the oven to  bake 400 for 5-10 mins didn't time it I left my chicken till i feel like it was properly cooked I tasted as I cooked.  It was pretty good, A msg from the wise DONOT COOK WITHOUT TASTING!!

Yummy I did it a little different I used Jamaican hot sauce and it is VERY spicy so I used more brown sugar. The result was a sweet taste then a bust of spice yum :)
