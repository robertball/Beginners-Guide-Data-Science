If you want to improve this recipe then follow these steps: 
1. First saute the chicken in a little bit of oil or butter until a light brown colour. 
2. At this point you can add any vegetables you want, such as onion, potatoes, carrots, cellery, or even apple bits etc. 
3. Instead of water, you can use chicken broth, or a small amount of buillon to add more taste. 
4. More importantly, if you dont want your yogurt to currdle then you have to remove the pan from the heat when you add the yogurt. Too much heat will cause it to curdle.  Then just simmer for a few minutes over very low heat. 
5. Remeber that you can adjust the kind and quantity of curry to your taste.

This recipe gets four stars primarily due to how easy it is. I did doctor it up a bit. I Sauteed the chicken pieces in a bit of olive oil and fresh garlic, added some onion and carrots. Served over couscous this makes a simple and yummy dinner! HINT - To keep your yogurt from curdling either bring it to room temperature before adding it to anything hot or add some starch...a tbsp of flour or cornstach mixed into 1 cup of yogurt before adding it to the hot dish will do the trick. Also,it's best not to boil or simmer yogurt..it's kills all of the good bacteria!

I've made plenty of curries with yogurt and would recommend anyone to try this recipe. I would advice to mix the yogurt with some cornstarch and gently fold it in at the end of cooking. It will stay creamy and consistent without curdling.

Personally this is my favorite curry chicken recipe with my adjustments. First of all I bake this recipe on 350 for 1-1/2 hours.Instead of using water use chicken bullion (and about half of what this recipe calls for) more yogurt (be sure to add either flour or cornstarch to prevent the curdleing) and for the last 15 minutes of baking add fresh cut up tomatoes. (the more the better!) YUMMY!!

I'm really glad I tried this recipe, despite some of the reviews worrying me.  I was very careful to turn off the heat when I added the yogurt mix and I didn't heat it much at all after stirring it in, just enough to make everything warm.  Also, I would recommend draining nearly all the water off the chicken.  You can always add a little water back in if the sauce seems like it's going to be too thick.  I used red curry powder instead of mild.  Delicious!

I've never really tried curry foods, but this seemed awful.  I don't think the yogurt is supposed to curdle, and the smell was awful!

This recipe is fine. Those who have a hard time with curdling yogurt simply have not done a lot of cooking with yogurt. Sometimes even lowering the temp and adding corn starch does not help. Yogurt is a mild product. Curdling doesn't mean it's bad. Cottage cheese and Ricotta are curdled cheese products, but there's nothing wrong them them, or curdled yogurt. Mine curdled too. I ate it anyway, and it was fine. I cooked it down to reduce the water content a bit. It does have some texture, but tastes just fine. For those of you who don't realize this, all the curds are is small bits of yogurt cheese, which can be made by simply straining the water out of yogurt through cheese cloth. Curdling is just a hazard of working with cooked yogurt. Toughen up and eat it! There are too many people starving in this world to justify throwing food away without even trying it.

This is a nice base recipe to make a quick curry. I added sauted onions, broccoli, garlic and used 2 tbsp of a thai curry paste instead of powder. I like it hot and next time will up the amount of paste.

I drained off most of the water as I simmered with a lid on and found if I took the pan off the element, the yogurt mix blended without seperation.

I don't know what I did wrong but like the other reviewer, my yogurt curdled and I had a mess on my hands.  I ended up having to throw out everything.

My yogurt also curdled in the pan, but the taste was fine. I suggest mixing some extra yogurt and curry powder to use for dipping or to pour over the chicken after cooking.

Very good recipe.  I also added cinnamon and a little extra curry powder for more taste.  Potatoes diced and boiled can be added as well.  However, the calories and carbs will go up.

Turned out wonderful. Sautéed chicken first, added onions and celery. The yogurt has to be added after taking it off the heat to avoid curdling.

Boiled chicken is less than exciting, so i sauteed the chicken in a drizzle of olive oil and curry, paprika, cumin and a dash of ginger.  It turned out lovely.

I followed the recipe almost exactly and I also needed to pour off some of the water.  Based on reviews, I added yogurt after I took the pan off the heat and it did not curdle!  I also used a lot more curry powder than mentioned.  I used non fat greek yogurt and find this to be a very good low carb dish.  It's a good idea to throw in some onion and other vegetables.  I will make this again and I like it best cold!

This came out wonderfully last night.  I did have to drain out some of the water after the chicken cooked.  I also added some raisins because that is how the Indian restaurant in my neighborhood serves it.  Lovely!

This recipe was easy.  However, the curry taste was way too mild for my taste.  I added a lot of extra curry and a dash of garam masala.  I also added some steamed onions and peppers with success.

Very good! Did as suggested, used less water, and lowered the temperature to add the yogurt so it didn't curdle. So yummy!

When I made this recipe I cut it half so I olny had 2 servings instead of four. I thought it was way too bland and my Dad thought I should add veggies to it so next time I think I will use more curry powder, add Chinese Five Spice and come onions and/or peppers

I really wanted to like this recipe, but the sauce came out watery and curdled and the overall effect was pretty bland. I ended up picking the chicken out and mixing it with some aromatic saffron rice, but  I won't be trying this one again.

4 star for this basic recipe and because I have my own favorite ingredients that go along with curry, I decided to try this: 

1) Instead of using plain yogurt, I used Baked Apple Pie flavor yogurt.
2) Added hot curry instead of mild because my husband and I love curry. 
3) Also, for more flavor, I added my onion mix which consists of lemongrass, galangal, ginger, garlic and small onions. Definitely gave it a kick! 
4) With a little hint of lemon juice, salt and cilantro to top it off.
5) I marinated the chicken with all the ingredients for at least an hour before baking.
5) Instead of cooking it in a saucepan, I baked it 375 degrees F for about 45 minutes.

This is definitely a keeper! :)

I did not care for this.  Yogurt curdled.  Was not even edible.
