These were awesome.  The four stars is only because of the mistakes in the recipe.  I read the reviews first which helped.  I used an 8x8 baking pan and baked it at 325 for 25 mins and then at 300 for 15 mins more.  The key is to make sure that the middle is nearly as high as the edges...then you know it's done.  I also turned the oven off, cooled it a little bit, and let the dessert sit in there for about 20 mins more as the oven cooled down.  It turned out wonderfully and was a huge hit at our pot luck.  My husband is already asking for me to make it again.  Yum!

My family loved this! You can half the chocolate chips and shortening, it'll look better when you drizzle it on. My sister-in-law made this first and the same thing that happened to her happened to me (it wasn't done in the middle after 30 minutes) so she told me to turn the oven off and crack the oven open and let it sit in there for an extra hour--it did the trick! My crust was a little stuck, but my sister-in-law's didn't stick because she lined her pan with foil. ALSO--the pan size is 9x9 not 9x13. The recipe doesn't exactly say, so yes, it's 9x9 and there's a perfect amount of everything.

I will make this again!

I was supposed to bring it to my office's cookie swap and the recipe is wrong! There is not enough cream cheese filling.  Very disappointed. Will never make again.

SUPER SWEET STRAIGHT SUGAR!!! Fo a more festive look add a little bit of red food coloring to the cheese mixture and make sure the mint candies are green....sprinkle a light layer of either powder sugar or shredded coconut for a snow appearence!

Very good! One reviewer noted that their crust turned out wrong, try baking it until it fluffs up all the way to the center (it will fall when filling is poured in) About the undercooked results, turn the oven off and keep the cake in for an extra 30 minutes. Also, this recipe calls for way too much chocolate on top. I felt it would take away from the cheesecake itself so I omitted the drizzle and cut the amount of mint candies in half, it was just perfect!

I was VERY disapointed when making this. The product that came out looked nothing like the picture posted. As others have commented there is not enough Creamcheese filling. So my friend told me to try to add anuther package of creamcheese and two more eggs. it did nothing. I baked it at 325 for 25 minutes then again for 10 minutes and then AGAIN for anuther 10 minutes. Still the middle was not cooked. But i took it out because i didn't want the outside to burn. And figured/hoped that when i cooled it, the product would firmen up a bit. But it didn't i cooled it for about an hour to two hours and when i cut it. it was all mushy and falling apart. the bottom stuck to the pan. it was a disaster. I will not make this again. Please watch out for the recipe posted is wrong.

I followed the other reviewers' advice, and this turned out pretty well. The cheesecake filling, for the most part, was really nice and creamy. It did get grainy near the edges - not sure what caused that. Otherwise, though, it was a hit!

Very good.  Big hit at parties.  Some of the times are a little off.  Use common sense to gauge when the crust is hot enough to harden correctly.  It usually takes a few more minutes than the recipe calls for.  And after the whole cake is done baking, turn the oven off while it's still in, crack the door, and allow the cake to cool in there.  The remaining heat makes the cake fluffy and flat on top, instead of concave.  One of my favorites.

There is not enough cream cheese in the recipe, and mine turned out like gooey sweetened condensed milk.

Great recipe for the holidays.  Look for the candies in the candy section in the green box.  Good mint flavor.

I followed the recipe exactly and, like another reviewer discovered, did not have enough of the cream cheese mix to create the thicky and fluffy look. Next time I will use a square pan.

2 things to know before you make these- (1) this recipe is for a 9 inch square pan.  I doubled it and it was great in a 9x13.  (2) once it is done baking, turn the oven off and let it sit in there for another half hour to finish setting.  With that said, I was not overly impressed considering the work that went into these bars.  They were good, but not great.  I expected better and will keep searching for a recipe that "wow"s.

I am gluten intolerent and made this recipe with Glutano chocolate cookies with vanilla filling and it turned out wonderful.  Served it on St. Patty's Day and no one knew it was gluten free until I told them.  Great recipe.  Bonnie

Super yummy! I've made this for my family for the last several years for Christmas using tips by other reviewers for baking times, and it turns our great :) We also use mint oreos instead of regular oreos, which makes them even better!

They were a hit at a Christmas party.  I found the mint a little strange at first but it grew on me.
