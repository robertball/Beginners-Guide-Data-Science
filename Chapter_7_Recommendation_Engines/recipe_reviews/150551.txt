I made about 10 different candies for Christmas this year and this was my absolute favorite, some people said it was too rich for them. I dipped them in vanilla almond bark instead of chocolate. I think it was a much better favor combination than maple and chocolate. I will make it every year.

Wow these are sooooo good! I usually try and incorporate one new candy recipe every christmas.....this one is definetly a keeper! The only thing I would change is to use a little less powdered sugar so the filling would be a bit softer. Otherwise fantastic!

Yum.  These are good and easy to make, they are very rich.  We wanted to make some differant things this year, and I'm sure we will use this recipe again.  It tastes like a chocolate covered maple nut goodie.
