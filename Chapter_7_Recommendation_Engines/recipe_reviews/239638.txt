I cut this recipe in half and used ranch dressing using a recipe from one of the Buzzers on this site (Semigourmet's).  Before putting the crumbs on the chicken I lightly rubbed a little ranch dressing on the chicken.  Other than the fact that my almonds were sliced rather than slivered, I did follow the recipe.  This was a very nice dinner, and I'll have leftovers for lunch today!  Thanks, Linda Rutko!

I did not put rice in it.  I used the whole can of soup, but I just used a generous squeeze of ranch dressing.  Also, I probably used half the cheese.  I did not have mozzarella, so I used the gouda I had (plus the cheddar), and it was VERY good!  I served it with rice and broccoli and it is definitely a keeper!

Very easy to make, only thing we didn't have on hand was the sliced almonds but found some to put in luckily. A little too "ranchy" for my own tastes since it calls for an entire bottle of dressing ... Likely will substitute a can of soup for a cup of the ranch next time. I just used a small bag of chips and it probably could've used two. The almonds tasted good but I'd slice them or chop them up more so it goes with the gooey delicious mess that is the casserole. Girlfriend enjoyed it and thought it was pretty decent too. Will try again with modification.
