This is also good if you use crushed Ritz crackers. I like to use a homemade dry ranch dressing mix instead of pre-packaged so that I can control the salt. I like to serve this with alfredo pasta.

GENIUS! This was delish and super easy to make! Only change I made to the recipe was using actual parmesan cheese rather than the grated stuff. The grated cheese comes packed with sodium which leaves the final product too salty for me. I changed it up and used real parmesan cheese and about 2 cups of corn flakes (prior to crushing). This made for a more crispy chicken, which is what I prefer.

Thanks for the recipe!!

This was so easy to make, and so delicious! the only thing i would do different, is the cooking time. I would bake it for aprox 30 min...mine came out a little dry.

This is a delicious dish!  I didn't have corn flakes, so I used crushed ritz crackers.  That was the only change I made.  I love this!  Oh, and I used freshly grated parmesan cheese.

My whole family loved this (even my picky tween daughter):) I used the Hidden Vally Ranch "spicy ranch" packet mix. This added just a little bit of a kick to it. Amazing! Will make again :)

My family wasn't yay about me doing the recipe, but when I cooked it. They LOVED it. When I did it for a second time, I cut back on the ranch dressing mix because the flavor of the ranch mix was little on the strong side for me. So, I put half of the mix. Still came out GOOD. For my family to like it, I was shocked because everyone likes different things and a few are REALLY, REALLY picky.

Good starting recipe! I used mayo instead of butter amd mixed in the ranch seasoning, garlic powder, crushed red peppers, and parmesan cheese. I didn't have any cornflakes on hand so I used panko instead. Cooked for 40 minutes, the chicken was nice and  juicy! Served with parmesan rice and green salad.

Have made this for my parents a couple times and they have loved it. Couldn't be simpler (lifelong bachelor who is just learning how to cook --if I can do this well and you are a conscious human being ...you have no worries here). I did put a mix of the ranch mix and Parmesan alone aside to coat the bottom of the breast with and then the mix with the cereal to coat the tops --worked out better not having the cereal turn gunky on the bottom. Also seemed to help to grate the Parmesan pretty finely (just mixed better). And used generic all bran flakes --tasted great! I also have felt like I should go by the thermometer reading rather than the 45 minutes to avoid a little overcooking. Thanks for this recipe!

Will definitely make again! I did change it slightly- I used fresh shredded parmesan instead of grated, and then I dipped the chicken in egg as opposed to butter. It was great- my 3.5 year old and 1.5 year old loved it, as well as my picky self and my hubby!

I used cheddar and panko vs parmesan and cereal- it came out incredibly salty. Not very ranch-like.

This is a fairly simple recipe and I used Ritz crackers.  The chicken was nice and juicy, not overly juicy and I will use this recipe again. Thanks Aurah!!!

This recipe was so easy and delicious.  I didn't have corn flakes so I used panko.  I also grated fresh parmesan cheese instead of using the regular parmesan cheese that is loaded with sodium.  My picky family absolutely love it!

Wow! This was so good! I went by the recipe. I did take the suggestion of another reviewer and make it 2 cups of cornflakes (prior to crushing). I usually season my chicken breasts with salt, pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder, next time I will go light on this, because the ranch packet gives it a strong flavor. Even without these changes this was fabulous! I am going to interchange with different seasoning packets...I don't see how you can go wrong!Thanks for posting this recipe!

TASTY!  I was making ranch chicken wraps for dinner and wanted a way to boost the flavor, more than my ranch dressing would add.  This was perfect. I used the entire packet of ranch, the full amount of grated Parmesan, and crushed Fritos, since that was the only crunchy item I had on hand.  Since I only used 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, I reduced the butter to 1/4 cup.  I cut the chicken into small strips and then coated the strips in the butter and dry mix and baked at 375 for 25 minutes.  I wrapped a few strips of the baked chicken in a whole grain tortilla with some bacon, tomato, shredded cheddar, and ranch dressing.  While delicious, it was quite salty, which is entirely my fault (Fritos!).  I will make sure to use corn flakes next time, and either grate my own fresh Parmesan or reduce the ranch mix by half.  Thank you for sharing, Aurah... I'll be recommending this one to others!

I use ranch dressing in the bottle to dip the chicken in and then coat with the corn flakes/parmesan mix. I didn't use butter. It's so good and easy to make.

I made this tonight for three college students and they couldn't say enough good things about it.  
"Excellent, delicious, a real taste-bud party going on!"  And the one I never tire of hearing. "Thanks for dinner, Mom, that was REALLY GOOD!"  I served it with fettuccine alfredo and mixed veggies....yum...

Tasty, quick and easy.  My boys loved it!  I used chicken breast tenders and cut the cooking time to about 35 minutes.  This  left the chicken juicy on the inside and nice and crispy on both sides.  Delicious!

I followed this recipe exactly, except I used plain low-fat yogurt to coat the chicken, instead of butter. (It kept the crumbs on really well and they got nice and crunchy.) I would have given it a 4, but it was SOOO salty!! Next time I would definitely use only half of the dressing package. It was good for a quick meal though, with ingredients you probably have on hand in a pinch.

I used real Parmesan cheese, and I tried garlic and butter Ritz crackers since that was what I had on hand. Next time I'll definitely use the cornflakes or normal flavored Ritz -- while the crackers are good on their own, it was a bit much on the chicken.

Made it exactly as the recipe (I did add some garlic powder).  It was delicious!  I have a pan that has a grate that sits about 1/2" above the bottom of the pan.  Keeps the grease out and the bottom doesn't get soggy.  Love this recipe!

I cut butter to 1/4 cup and added 1 T. olive oil and garlic powder.  I brushed butter mix on one side of chicken and only coated one side of chicken with crumb mix.  Was worried about bottom being soggy.  Glad I did that!  Was just as good.  Added fresh parsley to coating mix too.  Delicious!

I am a new cook and this was very easy!  Very moist, and flavorful.  I put some of the leftovers on Italian bread, this makes a great sandwich as well.  After reading other reviews I decided to use the Ritz crackers I already had instead of adding corn flakes to my list.  When I went to make this, I found only two left!  I used what I had, and of course I couldn't make as much but it still came out delicious.

Quick,easy simple meal. Paired it with a side salad and garlic mashed potatoes. And because we love our ranch had a side of that to dip the chicken. Was delicious and will definitely make again.

I did Italian bread crumbs instead of corn flakes and instead of butter I used two eggs beaten and it came out delicious and the breading was beautiful and also I used kraft Parmesan cheese in it. I also agree that a cook time of 30 minutes will do fine.  But of course I was using chicken breast tenderloins.

I read the reviews carefully and decided to use only half the ranch salad dressing mix.  It turned out great and my very picky kids ate everything!
My husband and I loved it too!! 
I'll definitely make this again.

I made this exactly as written. It's a fantastic recipe. My family asks me to make it for every
gathering. I also make it for my Husband and myself. I do use chicken tenders for the recipe. I usually cook them about 25 minutes, uncovered. Do not overcook chicken, it will be dry and tough.
This recipe will make you a hero, guaranteed.

I made this for my husband and I and made it exactly as the recipe said.  It was delicious.  Of course, for just the two of us it was a lot of chicken but  we ate the leftovers cold on a salad.  I did turn the broiler on at the end for a little while to crisp up the top.  It's so easy to make, great for a busy family.

Good base recipe. I made it the original way, but didn't care for the corn flakes the first time. So the second time I used Ritz crackers as others suggested (reduced to 1/2 c) as well as Italian style bread crumbs (1/4c). Many have said they had butter and crumbs left, however I always double dip my chicken so to get a thick layer and have nearly nothing left. Those I have made it for have enjoyed it. It is great with homemade mashed potatoes (I use red) and cooked carrots. Thank you for sharing the original. It truly is an excellent base recipe.

Followed the recipe to a tee except for using panko instead of cereal and baked for 30 minutes instead of 45. Everyone LOVED it! Great flavor with delicious crispy edges! This will now be a staple in our kitchen. Thanks for a great recipe!

I wasn't very fond of it. I thought it needed salt/more flavoring. I found a similar recipe on the back of a Bisquick box that was amazing. Think I'll stick to that one.

Very Nice!  I only changed 3 things.  One I used real grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, (because that is what I had and it is lower in sodium) I also used my own buttermilk ranch dressing mix. and only baked for 30 minutes.  other than that I  followed the directions.  They were really good, and very tasty.  But a bit greasy because of the butter and cheese.  Next time I might use a mixture of  Dijon mustard and milk in place of the butter.  it's a really good recipe though, thank you for sharing.

I combined the dry ranch mix & parmesan first, played with it some to get the mix to stick to the cheese since it sure wouldn't stick to the cornflakes - all to get it on the chicken, mind you.  :D  I played & pressed it a bit.  It stuck, then added the flakes.  Just that was too salty so I added more cornflakes.  I used 2 1/4c (before crushing) total; dressing mix & cheese unchanged.  'Seemed most of the parmesan slid of the chicken.  It tasted okay though, just not really parmesan-y.  'Good beginner dish, I suppose ... On the other hand, daughter, 15, put a "mine" post-it note on the last piece.  :D

I make this recipe once every two weeks. It's a family favorite. My 5 kids love it and the hubby wants leftovers for work. I do change the cheese from Cheddar to Jalapeño cheese to Italian blend so it doesn't get boring.

The chicken was crunchy and extremely flavorful. I was tempted to salt and pepper the chicken beforehand. I am so glad I didn't, it would have been too salty with the ranch dressing mix. Another great recipe for the kids.

I have been making this recipe for over 25 years. Have shared it with tons of people. Yes - mix it up using Fiesta Ranch, Spicy Ranch, Ritz Crackers or Panko. This is also good on Halibut.

I used the crushed Ritz crackers.  I needed to halve the recipe for my family of 3.  However, even when halving all of the ingredients, I did NOT halve the package of ranch dressing mix.  I used one lb of boneless, skinless chicken breasts and, because they were quite thick, I sliced them horizontally.  Because of that, I was able to cut the cooking time to 1/2 hour.  Also, IMO, it's much easier to put the dry ingredients in a plastic bag, rather than a bowl, (a la "Shake 'n Bake").

I really enjoyed this recipe. I made it exactly a written. I made sure I crushed the cornflakes really good. I did have thin cutlets so I wasn't sure about the cooking time so I inserted a digital thermometer into one of the breasts. They were ready after 12 minutes!! The breading did not look crisp enough so I stuck it under the broiler for a few minutes and that did the trick. May use a thicker breast next time.

Everyone in my house loved this!  It was voted to stay in the recipe box with a resounding YES!  I deducted one star only because some of the breading was mushy and some was crunchy, but I suppose that could have been my mistake.

Delicious! Really easy too. The only thing I had a little problem with is that the breading wouldn't stick to the chicken I had to really pile it on the top. Its possible that I didn't crush the cornflakes enough. (??) I used bone-in chicken breasts which really increased the cooking time to about 1 hour, 10 min. I did use fresh Parmesan as a recommendation of a reviewer. My picky 9 year old had seconds! Thanks!

This was really good! I was worried it would get soggy in the pan but it really didn't, it was crispy and juicy...perhaps a tad on the bland side for a main dish but I'll definitely use the recipe next time I want a chicken topper for salad or pasta.

Moist and delicious recipe that is so easy to make! I did use Ritz crackers instead of the corn flakes because I had them in stock. That was the only change I made. Will definitely add this to the dinner menu rotation!

I made this recipe exactly using strips of chicken breasts.  The taste is there for sure and it is really good!! My only little draw back was the butter puddled when it was cooking on the baking sheet and it made me think of fattening the whole time, but I enjoyed the dish anyway! LOL  I changed it up with a few of the strips and crushed french fried onions with part of the dressing and parm mixture which was also good.  Would definitely like to try again without the butter (flour/egg) and with Ritz crackers!  Yummy!

My daughter looked at me like I was crazy when she watched me crushing the corn flakes. But she absolutely loved it when it came out of the oven. Quick, easy, inexpensive and absolutely delicious is the best way to describe this recipe!

I though it was very good and delicious. My parents and siblings loved it. When you bake the chicken I would watch and drain the juices that appear when the chicken starts to cook. If you leave in the juices the bottom breading will get soggy.

Fantastic!!  Will be making again. I can reduce the butter. Threw out probably half. Probably could reduce topping also or just use more chicken.

Chicken turned out super juicy!   I used panko bread crumbs and costco organic parmesan cheese.  I didn't  have any powdered ranch dressing mix, so I used bottled ranch dressing to dip the chicken in.   Would definitely make again as it only took 5 minutes to prepare for the oven!

I made it as per the recipe, although I did add Trader Joe's "21 Seasoning Salute" (salt-free blend...as we've got to watch our sodium intake).  This was very  easy and it was just something a little different for boneless skinless chicken breasts, which we have a lot.  I'll be making this again.

I poked holes in the chicken with a fork then dipped the chicken in extra virgin olive oil. I combined Italian bread crumbs and ranch dip dry mix in a seperate bowl and dipped the chicken in it and baked at 350 for 45 minutes. juicy and full of flavor!! yummy!!!

Making this for the second time since we really liked it the first time. This time I only made half as much of the topping,  as I found even with over 3 lbs of chicken, it is plenty.

This was really good! I followed the recipe exactly, as I always do the first time I make something. The chicken was moist and flavorful! My kids were disappointed when they gobbled it up and their wasn't any more! That's saying something, since all 3 of my kids are pretty picky! I will definitely make this again!

Didn't have cereal, so subbed w/ panko.  This comes out somewhat crispy on exterior and moist on interior (which we loved)!  The ranch mix makes it a bit salty though.  But everyone loves it in our household!

Wouldn’t make any changes. Will definitely make this again. So simple to make, yet so delicious. 10/10 would recommend.

You can probably decrease the  crumbs and parm cheese by 20 %.  Easy to make  and very tasty.

Yummmm!!! Made mostly as stated, except I cut my chicken into strips, used fresh grated parmesan cheese, and sprinkled garlic powder on the chicken before the coating process. I also made more of the breading because I made more. I took this advice from other reviewers. Turned out great! Baked at 375 for 25 minutes. Thanks for the recipe!

This has become a staple in our house. There isn’t a better chicken recipe to put on top of fettuccine alfredo. I always use panko bread crumbs instead of the corn flakes and it is always awesome.

I made this for our family and two additional families who were under the weather and needed a meal. Both asked for the recipe and gave it rave reviews! I used plain panko bread crumbs, and a combination of grated and shredded parmasean/romano cheeses. Also added a whipped egg to the butter mixture and a touch of milk to help the panko stick and lots of pepper. If you use panko, keep a close eye on it in the oven as it burns more rapidly than cornflakes or breadcrumbs. Served with baked garlic potato wedges and a salad--great meal!

Just okay. The chicken was moist and flavorful, but the mix of the ranch dressing and parmesan cheese was just bland. Something was missing..not sure what. So it wasn't bad, it was just okay. Next time I will consider additional seasonings.

This was super east tyo make and oh so good.  I didn't have any ranch dressing so I used Cesar dressing that I make on my own and I used Italian breadcrumbs since I had some on hand.  Still good and now requested by my husband.

Excellent!  I made a lot of changes, but the quantities were a wonderful guide.  Instead of butter I used 1/3 cup Extra Virgin Olive Oil to dredge the chicken.  I used 1/2 cup of generic bread crumbs instead of the corn flakes, and I used a little over 1 TBSP of homemade Ranch dressing mix.  I also used shredded parmesan cheese, but recommend topping the chicken with it 25 minutes into cooking so it doesn't burn.  Also, if you tenderize the chicken thin like I do beforehand then total cook time only needs to be 35 minutes.  Use a glass dish for easier cleanup.  Thanks for the great recipe idea!

Pretty good. Used fresh parmesan. Came out a little dry so next time I would watch the cooking time and maybe take it out sooner. Otherwise good flavor and easy!

It's a very simple and tasty recipe. The tricky part is cooking chicken breast just right so it's fully cooked but not dry. If you use boneless chicken thighs, it's easier. 
We didn't have corn flakes so we used bread crumbs. It's very good.
The ranch dressing is already salty so do not add any salt!

Tender and juicy. I did as most reviewers suggested and reduced cooking time to 25-30 minutes. I also used the crushed Ritz crackers. But personally, Ritz are not what they used t be; I could have used pancko or breadcrumbs; the flavour is in the dressing. It was a delicious, easy weekday meal.

I used bottled buttermilk ranch and olive oil as replacements. I also combined my crushed flakes with garlic seasoned bread crumbs.   I coated my pan with the olive oil to prevent sticking as well as to help crispen the chicken.  Then I dipped the chicken breasts in the ranch dressing.  Then coated the pieces in the corn flakes/bread crumbs. Layed the chicken in the coated pan and baked for approx. 45 min until done.  Came out great, ate with mashed potatoes and veggies.

Except for scaling down for 2 servings, I made this exactly as written.  I did not use corn flakes, I used corn flake crumbs, so that may have been the problem.  Too bland, not crisped enough.  My husband thought it was fine, so I may use actual cornflakes and possibly egg to dip the chicken in.  I also may make a full recipe to see if that makes a difference.  It's so easy to make that if I can get it to have something extra, it might be worth tinkering with.

The whole family loved it! To cut down on carbs (or if you are following Paleo) we used pork rinds instead of Corn Flakes and it came it out awesome!

This recipe is fantastic.  I know that recipes should be graded as given, but I didn't have corn flakes, so I just used bread crumbs.  It is a very flavorful chicken recipe that is very easy to make, and it has quickly become one of my wife's and my favorite recipes.  We make it almost weekly now.

Love this recipe, made it twice so far.. Felt that the corn flakes were a little bland in flavor so i substituted for frosted flakes. Adds a sweet flavor to the breading but not overwhelming.. 5 stars

Delcious! I make this all the time. I am now known for making this delicious dish. I impressed my in-laws and my super picky kids even like it. It is super easy to make and doesn't make a big mess in the kitchen. I place the cornflake mix in a large ziploc bag and coat the chicken breasts that way. It makes clean up a breeze. Highly recommend this recipe.

I made this with boneless skinless breast tenders one night (cut cooking time by a third).  My whole family liked it and is requesting it again.  Love this recipe- easy, cheap, tasty, and, when paired with salad & fruit, makes a healthy meal!

I have made this twice now.  The first time I made as is and it was a hit with my family.  Last night, I needed a quick and easy recipe, so I made this again. I did not have corn flakes in the house, so I used Panko Bread Crumbs... yum. I think we liked this even better.  A tender, moist chicken breast with a crispy delicious coating.  Easy and delicious!

Only changed recipe cause it's what I had.  Used Panko breadcrumbs instead of cornflakes.  Had plain yogurt on hand so dipped pieces in it instead of butter (but I'm sure butter woulda been good too).  This was most delicious/"moist" breaded chicken breast ever.  Had leftover piece in a salad next day....soooo good.  This is a basic keeper for sure!

I used Ritz crackers, but I just didn't care for the Parmesan and I used fresh!  Maybe just a personal thing.  To be honest, I let it get too cool, waiting for a side to get done.  It WAS very moist.

this came out really good. I only used half the butter and mixed it with a room temp egg. I also add a little cayenne pepper and garlic powder to this butter/egg. I only had bread crumbs and chicken tenders, but this worked out fine too. bake at 400 for about 30mintues. a new favoraite!

I did use Panko bread crumbs instead and it was fantastic. Also, instead of using butter on the meat to coat, I used ranch dressing. Will make again. Very good. Cooked it for about 30min came out perfect.

I don't know why I didn't think of combining my two favorite foods: ranch and Parmesan a long time ago. My oldest gave it 10/10. Don't think I'd change a thing really. I used what I had available. Pablo, fresh Parmesan. It was awesome!

This chicken was very moist & delicious.  The only thing I did differently was to lightly coat the chicken w/flour (shaking off the excess) before dipping it into the butter.  This makes the coating adhere to the chicken much better.  The crushed Corn Flakes, Parmesan, and Ranch coating was very tasty.  Why anyone would use those nasty tasting Ritz Crackers, I'll never know!

Simple & tasty! I did brown off the chicken before baking to give it a nice golden brown color. I thought it might get crispy by browning first but didn't, still very good served as chicken parmesan served over spaghetti. Will make again, thanks!

Quick and easy--a good weeknight meal. The Parmesan smelled great as it cooked. I used panko instead of corn flakes (just what I had), 1T. butter and a scrambled egg to replace the butter (wanted to lighten it and keep butter flavor but next time might leave butter out all together) and chicken tenderloins (they defrost fast, I thought they would cook faster and I always have them in the freezer).   Took awhile for them to brown so maybe higher heat, less time? My girls liked them so we will do again. I will probably try lining the pan with foil and spraying with cooking spray to make clean up even easier.

Made this last night for the family. I used Ritz crackers and homemade dry ranch dressing mix. These were the only substitutions that I made since they were on hand. The outer crust came out a little soggy. This was totally on us as hubby cut the chicken into really small pieces (think nugget size) and I didn't want the chicken to dry out. The flavor was great and I'll make again with larger pieces of chicken.

Used Ritz instead of Corn Flakes. Used "Dry Ranch Style Seasoning for Dip or Dressing" at 18 servings (3 tbsp) instead of ranch packet. Next time reduce black pepper to 1-1/2 tsp instead of 2-1/4 tsp

I went with another review and did Ritz crackers and fresh Parmesan cheese. Fresh peppercorns and a dash of sea salt directly on the chicken pror to everything else. Watch the salt people! Or simply stick to the recipe for safety reasion.

My family loved this! My husband said he could eat this every week. I made it as directed, except I flattened the chicken breasts a bit so it would bake more evenly, and quicker. It took around 25 minutes that way.

This recipe was super easy and quick if you use chicken fingers instead of whole chicken breasts.  I used the ritz crackers crushed as well and it tasted great.  I had just enough left over for 1 lunch and left me wanting more.

This was a great dish, glad I tired it. I would dispute the calorie count with the amount of butter and cheese involved, well at least how I made it, but oh well it was very good.

This was very good. My husband even made a rare and unsolicited comment of approval. I made 2 chaanges because of what I had on hand.  Instead of parmesean, I used monterey jack cheese. Also I used Italian bread crumbs instead of corn flakes. It was tender and flavorful. I also reduced baking time to 30 minutes.

It was a little salty, but very good. I may cut back on the ranch dressing using only 1/2 a pack

I made this tonight; it was ok. Th breading semi-stuck on the chicken.  Wished the chicken could have been more crispier.  I had to cook longer than 45 mintues to get the inside meat nice and soft (prob cooked for 1:30).

Loved this recipe!  So easy to make and flavorful. I even switched out the chicken for tofu (made them into ranch tofu patties instead) and my family still licked plates clean.

If I made this for dinner everyday for a month my husband still wouldn't get sick of it. He keeps asking when I'll make it again. Great recipe and surprisingly simple and inexpensive.

One of the best Parmesan baked chicken recipes I have tried.  Only change was we added garlic powder to the butter which is a must in our house.

It was just OK, nothing spectacular. I couldn't even taste the ranch which was what I was looking forward to most.  We made sandwiches with and they were good, but I don't think the chicken would be good by itself.

Delicious and super easy! I used a spicy ranch packet and chicken tenders.  A little soggy on the bottom but still awesome.  I served mine with a Green Giant Cheesy Broccoli and Rice serving.  Great dinner for one!

Loved the recipe. Loved that it made enough to freeze and eat later...still very good. Hubby likes it better than the Hellman's chicken with parmesan and bread crumbs.

This was delicious!  My husband is not a big fan of chicken, but he loved it, too.  I made it exactly as written except for using breast tender strips instead of breast halves.  It was very moist and tender!

My husband said this is his new favorite chicken recipe.  Even the picky 14 year old loved it..  I took other peoples idea and used Ritz crackers which made it a little sweet with all the butter.  Peas and mashed potatoes were perfect as side dishes.

The first time I made this recipe, I made the mistake of buying & using the hidden valley "Dips" mix instead of the dressing mix and oh boy, was it bad. There was a lot more sodium in the Dips mix and the chicken came out almost too salty to eat. I just made the chicken again today, using the right mix and it was good but it didn't blow me away. I may have over-pulverized the cornflakes, cause the chicken wasn't that crispy and didn't build up a great breading. I'd give it another shot though.

My six year old LOVED this chicken, hence the 5 stars.  I thought it tasted pretty salty but good.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of subbing Panko (whole wheat/white mix) for the corn flakes.

I used Panko because I had  no corn flakes.   I saw only one review that mentioned the bottom of the chicken not being crispy.   Did no one else have this problem?   I would like to dip the chicken in something besides butter, something with a lower fat content.    Any suggestions?   Overall, very good. . . Tasty and moist.

Followed directions exactly and stuff did not stick very well to chicken.  We thought just okay.  Usually we use Shake and Bake with an equal amount of Parmesa added and get better results.  Sorry!  Just not for us!Crumbs were tasty, just did nit stick to chicken.

I'm a gluten intolerant mother of two little ones and WOW, this was a great recipe for all of us. Just loved it. It came out crispy on top and the chicken was juicy. Because I was cooking with another dish I changed the temp from 375 to 350 and baked for 40 minutes. It was excellent. Will definitely become a family favorite. And it is really easy.

Great taste,but I wish there was a way to keep the 'breading' on the bottom side of the chicken from getting soggy... I used Ritz crackers and pounded my chicken so it would bake evenly.

My mistake with this recipe is that I cut the chicken breasts into medallions and used the same amount of Ranch dressing mix.  The chicken was saltier than it should have been.  Other than that, it is an enjoyable chicken dish.

I LOVED it my family devoured it. Simply great and easy to make. I will make it again, one of my favorites. Stumbled across this looking for a new way to make chicken. If you like ranch you will love and it was crunchy more than I thought, which was a good thing!
