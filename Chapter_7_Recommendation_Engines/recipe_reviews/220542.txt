I made this for a family gathering and it was a hit with everyone.  I wasn't sure how the cheeses would work together but wow!  I saved it for a night when the rest of dinner wasn't too heavy and there was not a speck left.

This was good, but a bit salty and dry.  I think next time I might add a bit of sour cream to lighten it up.  It was enjoyed at our New Year's Eve party!

THIS IS SO GOOD HOT OR COLD TO SPREAD ON BREAD, CRACKERS OR ANY FLAT BREAD.  I MIGHT EVEN TRY USING TUNA, BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT IS WHAT IT IS.  I USED 1/3RD FAT CREAM CHEESE, ADD A BIT MOR CORNED BEEF AND MORE CHEESE TO STRETCH THE RECIPE.. THANKS NIKKI FOR GOOD ALMOST HEALTHY SPREAD.
