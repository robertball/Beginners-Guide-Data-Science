This recipe was amazing! My husband and I absolutely loved it and it will definitely go into our regular rotation of side dishes. I used Beaver Hot Creamy Horseradish rather than grated and it turned out perfectly:) I also simmered the carrots in the water for about 15 minutes because I like them to be a bit softer; they tasted wonderful with the creamy sauce!!

Delish! My recipe used more onion (1 small)and 2 T. butter mixed with the Panko but otherwise the same. Everyone enjoyed this at my Christmas party and many asked for the recipe.

These are excellent! I didn't tell my husband what we were having and he took one bite of these and went "MMMM horseradish carrots!" I think the breadcrumbs may be unnecessary though. I cut my carrots on a thin bias used prepared horseradish because that's what I had on hand and garnished the finished dish with fresh chopped parsley. Will make again!

This recipe sounded really good and the directions worked fine but for me the horseradish did not enhance the carrots (neither did it taste totally bad hence the 3-star rating). I also did not like the combination of the crunchy panko with the smoother carrots. Everyone should try this recipe though--some probably will like it. Not bad just didn't seem to really go together.

I used baby carrots and boiled them around 10 mins. I did not have Parmesan so omitted. I liked the crunch from the panko. I thought this was a very different way of making carrots. It had an unusual taste that 2 out of a family of 4 enjoyed so a 50/50 shot. I am not sure if I would do it very often but definitely is worth a try. It reheated well too. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
