Yummy, I used a baguette.  I would have given it 5 stars if you instructed to lightly toast the bread first.  (The pesto/tomatoes make it soggy.  Pesto was fantastic, I used basil and parsley mixed and added a little salt and pepper.  I have plenty pesto left over for tomorrows dinner which I will toss with pasta and shrimp alfredo.  FYI - pine nuts are also called pignoli nuts and you can find them near your olives, pickles etc. or in your pasta sauce section in your supermarket.  I toasted in small non skillet by itself for a minute or two.

These are so freaken good! My husband and kids love these so much that I have to double the batch each time I make them. I agree with the last review, you can get away with less olive oil.

Awesome! My fiance doesn't prefer basil but loves this! Always the first to go at parties! Use fresh moz and parm...it makes a difference! Also, use baguette slices lightly toasted on both sides to avoid soggines. Watch pines nutss , as they burn very easily!Thanks for the great recipe!

Great recipe.  I've made it several times and have received rave reviews each time.  I do recommend lightly toasting the bread slices (a baugette works well) before adding the pesto; otherwise the bread tends to get a little soggy.  I've made this with havarti, munster, and swiss cheese on top - and they are all good!  Note - I used pre-made pesto...it cut down on time and still worked well.

This was just excellent and I plan to make it often given it's summer and I'll have a bountiful supply of beautiful basil and vine-ripe Roma tomatoes in my garden. I did take a short cut in that I always keep homemade basil in the freezer (I put it in zip-loc bags, sort of flatten it out, then break off chunks as I need it).  Since there was only Hubs and me eating it, I opted to use fresh Italian rolls from a wonderful old Italian bakery in Milwaukee. I agree with the submitter to slice the tomato thinly, although this is just a matter of personal preference.  Not only is this delicious, with the slightly crunchy toasted Italian bread with its classic "Caprese-style" flavors of basil, tomato and mozzarella, but it also makes your mouth water just from its eye appeal.  For me, this is some darn good comfort food.

I had so much basil in my garden, I was not sure what to do with it all.  We tried this recipe and loved it.  I even froze some for later.  Thanks so much for submitting.

I didn't use the pesto recipe from this recipe, but made my own with cilantro, basil and sundried tomatoes.  But the rest of the recipe was fantastic.  I made these as appetizers and our guests loved them.  They are so easy once the pesto is made.  I also added a little bit of italian seasoning and crushed red pepper to each bread slice to spice them up a little.  Delicious!

These are THE BOMB! I and my guests couldn't stop eating them. I did slice and toast (on both sides) the french baguette. The only other change I made was to substitute walnuts for the pine nuts. I finely ground the walnuts in a coffee bean grinder that I use only for nuts so as not to transfer any coffee flavor over from grinding coffee beans. Pines nuts are so expensive and walnuts or even pecans are a cheap and tasty substitute.

I used this recipe for New Years Eve and it was wonderful.  I had already prepared Pesto and used that for some and some store bought Lemon Artichoke Pesto......they were wonderful too!

Very easy, didn't take any time at all...I put them in the broiler for about 3 minutes and they were done!

Wonderful.  I made this with premade pesto, put a little extra shredded paremsen cheese and topped with more cheese.  SO GOOD.  The second time I made it, the quote of the night was "Pesto bread good." (said in Incredible Hulk voice).  That was all anyone said until the plate was clean.

This was an ULTRA QUICK, snack solution for unexpected guests. I used Ciabatta bread and followed the instructions to a T. Everyone loved it, and I will definitely be doing it again and again ...

Thank you for such a simple & delicious recipe! If you don't have time, you can just buy pesto (I used Trader Joe's). You can easily eat this alone as a light meal. It would also make great appetizers...just cut it into small pieces!

I made this with store-bought pesto - I didn't have time to go through the pesto making process.  It turned out great.  I would definitely use this as an appetizer for a party in the future!

There must be an invisible person putting crack in these things because they are so darn addictive!  The only thing I do differently with this recipe was use store bought jarred pesto.  I'm too lazy to make it from scratch.  It still turns out excellent.  These make great appetizers and are requested often at my house!

Quick and delicious.  Quick, because I used purchased/prepared pesto -- delicious, because what's not to like?  I took another rater's advice and toasted the bread (a little) under the broiler before assembling the bread and sticking it under the broiler to melt the cheese.  I used jack cheese because that's what I had on hand.  I'll definitely make it again.

I liked this recipe to serve with italian food instead of the same old garlic bread. Next time I will stick with my "tried and true" pesto sauce that I prefer however. Thanks for the recipe.

As I don't have a blender or any appliance that would make the pesto, I cheated and bought Red Rock Deli Dip Basil Pesto & Cashews to spread.  I lightly toasted bread first.  Some slices I also put on a semicircle slice of salami between the pesto and the tomato.  This recipe was quick, easy, and a winner with all my guests.  I can only imaging it would taste even better with home made pesto.  Wish I had room for more kitchen appliances.

WOW!  This is so delicious! I had quite a bit of basil in my garden that I needed to use before it went to seed. This recipe sounded great and it didn't disappoint. Next time I may add a thin slice of red onion.

These were excellent.  I tried a few without the tomato, since I ran out, and they were great as well. I tried slices around 1/2 inch and 1/4 inch thick and really like the thinner better. The bread was less hard and easier to eat, but the pesto oil soaked through a little.  Still way yummy.

Cooking is not one of my favorite things but I had a ton of basil so I started looking for a recipe which called for a ton of it.  I'd never made pesto before and I must say, I really really liked the results.  I'll freeze some of it like another "cook" suggested and impress my sister with my home cooking.

Very refreshing and delicious.  I took it to my gym for a pot luck and it was gone within minutes!  I didn't have tomatoes and used canned diced tomatoes and it was still pleasing to the palate.

So easy!  I do suggest toasting the bread on both sides before adding the pesto.  I used bottled pesto and provolone cheese.  I think that sundried tomatoes or even canned tomatoes would be good as well.  I used fresh Roma.  This was a favorite at a recent party which I found ironic as it was the quickest and easiest!  Several people wanted the "recipe".  The combination of pesto, tomato and cheese is a sure winner.  Thanks for a great recipe.

You would expect the bread to be nice and crisp; however, the basil mixture is very moist and makes the bread slightly soggy.

This was very good but I had to improvise a little with the pesto sauce when I discovered I didn't quite have enough fresh basil leaves.  Think the recipe was close but not sure.  Also, I discovered that the edges of the bread (I cut the slices about 1" thick) were starting to burn and the cheese browned and bubbling after just 4 mins. of broiling.  I would watch them carefully and remove them probably between 3 - 4 mins.  Overall very good and I will make again.

My family raved about these.  I thought they were really easy, especially when I make the pesto ahead of time.  I made it with a little less garlic to suit their tastes, but next time I'll definitely use the whole amount.

This is absolutely good. I made it for 2 people. I had some pesto sitting in my fridge so I followed the rest of the recipe and lo and behold. This was a light dinner for a lazy Sunday evening! Will make it again it is an excellent recipe to use leftover pesto or ripe tomatoes that need to be eaten ASAP!

Don't know what all the  hype is about.  I tried it with my homegrown basil and purchased pesto and didn't find anything special about either of them.

Yum! I used pre-made pesto  I had on hand and it was delicious.  Lightly toasting the bread first is a good idea. The bottom was slightly soft and would have been better toasted. Used homegrown tomatoes, mmmm!

This was so good.  I used my own pesto. I would  suggest  you first toast the bread and rub with a slice of garlic  before continuing with directions.  If you like pesto, you'll love this.

I used a baguette sliced length wise. Then toasted it first (as recommended by previous reviewers) on both sides. Had to use a store bought Basil Pesto sauce (used Giovanni Rana brand, as we don't have basil in our garden, YET) and modified it to fit the recipe adding 4 cloves of garlic, the pine nuts,  the parmesan & a bit of extra olive oil. 
Can't wait to try it with fresh basil! Will make great appetizers or even pizza.

Very yummy!  My only suggestion is to broil/toast bread first before adding toppings and broiling.  It makes it a little more crunchy and less soggy.

Really nice flavours. My husband and I made it and it was really nice with some pasta. We added another garlic clove to it and used shredded cheese instead. Also, I followed someone's advice and toasted the bread before adding the pesto so it wouldn't be soggy and it worked out! Would make again!

This is delicious! I made this using some homemade pesto that I already had on hand (same ingredients) and we really enjoyed it. The nice thing is that if you already have the pesto on hand this comes together in a snap! I have made this both with and without the tomatoes and it was great either way. Fast, easy and delicious! Thanks for sharing. :)

This got rave reviews at my most recent party.  I do think the fresh mozarella is a must for the freshest flavor, the same for making your own pesto vs using a jarred version.

I got this recipe on the "Daily Dish".It's a classic, but I didn't make it in years. My husband came so hungry from work that I didn't look up the exact recipe again.I just knew the ingrediences. So I ended up using too many nuts and not enaugh basil. I can't even tell. Delicious! I extra bought Giabatta bread. Perfect!

Yummy! This is excellent. I did cheat and use prepared pesto. I agree that the bread should be lightly toasted before adding the pesto and tomatoes. Can't wait to have this again.

Yummy. I used roasted garlic pesto bought from shop, used cheddar cheese (the only cheese in house), made these and served with salad for lazy Sunday lunch. Very easy & quick. Oh, and I too lightly toasted the baguette. Turned out fab. Thanks.

Very tasty and golden brown cheese is appealing to the eye.  I added salt and pepper to the tomatoes and sprinkled a little garlic powder and rosemary on top.  Yum.

I made this Saturday for a pre-concert luncheon.  I would give it 5 stars, but I made some changes.  For the sake of convienience, I used a good quality prepared pesto sauce, omitted the tomatoes and used grated parmesean cheese.  I served the bread with Smoked Salmon Chowder.  Yummy

Kids really liked.  Cheated and bought the pesto sauce.  I did not add the tomatoes but next time I will do half with tomatoes and half without them. (for kids & adults)  Thanks

I burned the heck out of this bread, but it was still pretty good, and had a pretty and impressive presentation for our guests.  I did use prepared pesto to save time...and watch it VERY carefully as it bakes!!!
