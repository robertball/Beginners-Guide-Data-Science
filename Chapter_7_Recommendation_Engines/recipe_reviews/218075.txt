These were tasty and my husband & daughter really liked them...however, as written this is a 4 star in my book due to the ginger. The ginger amount really needs to be decreased unless you love ginger. As written, the ginger overpowers. Next time, I will decrease the ginger. With this change they should be perfect.

Wow!  This was good!  I doubled the ingredients for 5 chops.  I didn't have soy sauce, so I substituted teriyaki in it's place.  Followed the rest of the recipe as stated.  Although, I forgot to reserve part of the marinade before putting in the chops, so I just boiled it for 5 minutes before basting the chops on the grill.  I let the chops marinate for 8 hours before grilling.  These were awsome!  
BTW... the USDA just revised their recommendations for cooked pork temps.  They now recommend cooking pork to an internal temp of 145 degrees, and then letting rest for 3 minutes.

Results were great (even though I didn't have enough Worchestershire sauce as I did 7 times the recipe)! Everyone loved it. I did stir-fry vegetables as one of my side dishes and found that the sauce is actually a great stir-fry sauce!!! Next time I make a stir-fry of any kind I will use this sauce!

This was absolutely fabulous!! I doubled the recipe ingredients and used baby back ribs. I marinated them in half the sauce (as mentioned) and then baked/basted them in the oven at 350. Wow - they were finger licking good! Thanks for a Keeper recipe!

AWESOME! My picky eaters gobbled it up! The child who puts ketchup on everything by-passed the ketchup for the sauce! The meat was tender and juicy. I finally found a recipe for pork that makes the whole family happy. I would like it to be slightly sweeter and little thicker....I will try with personal modifications next time. But overall VERY GOOD! And EASY :)

Let's get the hard part over first. The reduced sauce was too sweet and the cinnamon is too dominant. And that's AFTER I already cut it back to 1/8 of tsp. However, the pork was delicious and with a little reworking on the sauce, that would be delicious too. It almost tastes like an upscale, really interesting A1 Sauce. Just skip either the sugar or the honey and use only a sprinkle of cinnamon. I'm hanging on to this one! Thanks! :o)

These were absolutely delicious. I marinated for close to 5 hours, and they were very flavorful. The glaze was a very nice touch, too, and gave my guests the ability to control how strong of a flavor they wanted. I must admit, I thought twice before adding the cinnamon (I generally do not care for sweet in savory food), but I went with it, and I thought it added a really nice dimension. YUM!

I have made this before, but apparently didn’t review it at the time.  I made it again, this time using pork tenderloin instead of chops.  I made the marinade, but opted to skip the ginger and cinnamon, just as a personal preference.  As instructed I marinated the pork in half the marinade.  But before grilling I decided to thicken the reserved marinade to give it some body for basting.  I simmered it for the 5 minutes as indicated in step 4, but it wasn’t thickening for me, so I added a little cornstarch/water slurry to thicken it, just enough to coat the back of a spoon.  That gave it much better cling for basting and allowed me to do it ahead of time.

This is fabulous.  I make these chops several times a month.  They have been a hit with family and guests alike.  I grill pineapple slices to serve alongside these tasty chops.

Holy WOW was this good!! I didn't have cinnamon, but I don't know if it mattered. I made the kabobs, and I'm already thinking up other ways to use the marinade. I highly recommend this!

Okay, I have used this recipe so many times now! I make something with it once a week, we like it that much! This past week, I made some burgers on the grill, and I put some of the thickened sauces on each side of the burgers. These were the most juiciest and flavorful burgers I have ever made! I have used this with all different meats, and now I make sure I have all the ingredients on hand at all times. I call it "Liquid Gold" now! I have used it for cookouts, and had nothing but rave reviews also. We just love it, and thank you so much for sharing it!

4.5 Stars: I cut a 2.5 lb pork loin roast into slices and marinated for 2 days.  It was very good, but be careful with the cinnamon.  We all agreed a touch more cinnamon would have ruined it.

These chops were very tender, but I thought that the marinade gave them a terrible flavor.  It must have been the seasonings that I did not like as the liquid ingredients are quite common in most marinades that I like very much.  Sorry.  Won't be making this again.

These were a surprise, wasn't sure about the cinnamon? Marinated over 24 hrs and they were very good. I had some left over though and decided to make a sandwich, I did not care for that. The flavors did not go well they next day. Even my picky husband liked this one!

I've always been afraid to put chops on the grill because I thought they would dry out. I made these and followed recipe as printed and they came out fantastic! The only thing I didn't do was reduce the basting marinade after but used it as is for dipping and loved it. Will do these again and again!

I thought these were very good but you definitely need to grill them. I don't think the spices would work without the flavor that grilling it give them.

I tried this recipe last night for my husband and I and we loved it. Only used half of the ginger and used a little more honey and brown sugar. I put them under the broiler at first on low for the first 15 minutes and then changed up on hi and put them about in the middle of the oven since we do not own a grill at this time. This was the best pork we have ever had. GOOD STUFF !!

Delicious!  I marinated it over night.  and I ran out of Worcestershire sauce so I just made up the difference with Soy sauce. I doubled it for 6 pieces of pork and still had enough leftover for the sauce.

This is the best recipe for Grilled Chops that I have ever tried.  Wow!  They are so moist and so full of flavor.  I marinated mine for about 4 hours.  I can't imagine what they would taste like if they marinated overnight.  Amazing!  This is a keeper.

Wonderful recipe! I marinated overnight and grilled today the family gobbled it up with roasted new potatoes out of the garden. You just can't go wrong! I will make again and again...

i havent even cook the pork chops yet but this sauce is sooo good! i was leary about the ginger and cinamon so i only did a little dash of each. and i also didnt have soy sauce on hand so i used toshidos teriyaki. it is VERY sweet. but awesome! i tripled the receipe so we could have a lot of sauce for basting and over the top when done. i will def be making this more often!

This is a great easy recipe. The only thing I wanted to mention is that as a professional chef i feel it my duty to let you know that it is considered safe by the fda to cook pork to an internal temperature of only 145 degrees, this guarantees the meat is cooked enough to kill any bad guys and also allows for a much juicier medium cooked meat.

Great marinade I have used it also on chicken but I think it is by far better on the pork.  The ingredients are readily available and i usually have it on hand.  I've done it without ketchup and cinnamon still good just different. I'm not a huge fan of ginger but I do think it is a good addition here.

This marinade is easy to whip up with ingredients that you probably have on hand in your pantry & fridge.  The blend of seasoning is just right - not too gingery as some people have commented.  I accidentally underestimated how much I'd need for the package of loin chops I'd bought so didn't have enough to make a sauce to serve with, but even having done double-duty as marinade and basting sauce was sufficient to impart a great taste.   Next time I'll try this with chicken.

Very nice.  I didn't baste or reserve sauce, but it still was very flavorful pork.  I didn't reserve any bc I had 5 pork chops and just wanted all of it to be marinated really well.  I let it marinate for over 24 hours, and it turned out very nice.  Thanks for the recipe!

Not bad, not great.  Not that crazy about the "spice" taste.  I like the concept and will try it again without the ginger and the cinnamon.

Way too much Worcestershire sauce, the marinade was thin and the family did not like it. I would adjust: 3 Tablespoons of Ketchup and 2 Teaspoons of Worcestershire instead of the other way around.

The best pork chops ever!  I used a low sodium soy but ended up adding Kosher salt, I also used 1/4 tsp of cumin and 1/2 tsp of liquid hickory smoke.  I grilled the boneless sirloin chops over a mixture of lump charcoal and soaked hickory chunks at high heat (500 degrees +).  The chops were succulent, like smoked ribs with no bones!  I cut my chops off of a sirloin roast.  They were about 1" thick.  I grilled them for 8 minutes on one side and 5 minutes on the other side.  Again the very best pork chops I've had, not dry, juicy and tender with a flavor that made me wish I would never get full or run out of chops!

These were perfect! I was looking for something different to do with pork chops and found this recipe. It was a bit too cold to grill outdoors, so I seared them in a cast iron skillet, finished them in the broiler while brushing several layers of the glaze on each side until I got a deep rich color.  Flavor is out of this world. This recipe is a keeper!

I made this last night with a side salad and pork stuffing.  It was delicious.  The marinade made the pork taste kind of like pork fried rice.  (just the pork part)  I made enough for left overs and we're going to try to actually make the pork fried rice tonight.  It's definitely worth a try.

Always a winner (as long as the pork isn’t over cooked!).  Used thin cut chops the most recent time I made these.  Cooked 3 minutes a side in cast iron skillet.   (...not a lot of cooking on the grill being done here in the Midwest in the dead of winter.  ??)

Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! This was incredibly delicious!!  I made it with white rice and asparagus and we dipped everything in the sauce!! I can't wait to make Pork Stir Fry and Fried Rice with the left overs! I would recommend using some sort of grill safe oil on the grates first... Mine got a little stuck at first! I also omitted the cinnamon because of the mixed reviews and I didn't have cloves of garlic so I used garlic powder and it was delicious. I do recommend boiling the marinade and using it as a dipping sauce..... Soooo Yummy!!

It is a bit different but more tasty than you might think. We had it with pasta but mashed potatoes would have been better. I found the sauce more than what was needed (I did 4x the recipe for 9 chops).

These pork chops were SO good!! I love the marinade!! I wasnt paying attention and missed the part where they needed to marinate for 4+ hours so I was only ended up being marinated for about an hour, but they were still great!! I also ended up sauteeing some mushrooms and onions with the leftover sauce and they tasted great!!

Soooo good!  I did not have any ginger but it was still really great!  Kids loved it!  Trying it on ribs and pork tenderloin next.  I doubled the sauce, marinated it for a couple hours, then take meat out and grill, boil leftover marinade and use as baste and then as sauce on plate.  One of my favorites!

These chips were amazingly good! We made the marinade for our thin chops to take with us to bbq at a housewarming party. The sweet, cinnamon-y, tangy flavor of the marinade was surprisingly good! We made these the next night for our whole family too. Definitely saving this one as we eat a ton of pork in our house!

Very good! My husband liked this more than I did, and he truly enjoyed this recipe! I enjoyed my salad more! I will keep searching for a great grilled pork chop  marinade! If I did this one again I would not add the cinnamon!

Okay ya'll. These are the real deal. I didn't read the recipe throughly when I found it and didn't realize I needed to marinade for 4-8 hours. So, I took my chances and made it anyway only having two hours before I planned to light the grill. They were delish! I can't even imagine how good these would be if I had let them marinade for the full 4-8 hours it states. I didn't reserve any sauce because I was scared about my lack of time and felt like it would need the full bang. Oh! One more thing - I used Sriracha sauce in lieu of ketchup. Highly recommend that substitute. Pairs perfectly with the sweetness.

As I do with most marinade recipes, I didn't measure anything but just added what I thought was about the right amount (which is usually much more than what is called for). Still, I would double this recipes as I had to recreate it to be able to reduce the left over sauce. Having said all that, I really enjoyed this recipe. Tangy with enough spice to have a bite. Saving this one!

The whole family loved this but I did make a couple of changes due to dietary restrictions and preferences.  I only used about 1/2 of each sweetener (which was plenty), used low sodium soy and Worcestershire, and only used a sprinkle of cinnamon and cayenne.  We can't wait to make pork fried rice with the leftovers and try this marinade with other meats ASAP.  I doubled the recipe for about 2.5# of meat but wished I would have tripled it and used 1/3 to marinate and 2/3 to reduce as we would have liked a little more sauce.  (Incidentally, I don't know why you can't boil the marinade too - wouldn't it kill any lurking bad stuff during the reduction process?)

This recipe was okay not too crazy about it. It needed salt which the recipe did not ask and since it has two salty sauces I thought it would not need it, bu it did. We grilled it and though  I shook as much off of the marinade once it hit the grill it started to caremelized quickly therefore burning a little after the grill marks on each side I finished it in the oven t prevent it from a complete burn. It was okay.

Great! My husband and I wanted something different so I gave this recipe a try and it turned out delicious! I used
pork chops(bone in) instead of pork loin, no ginger, and I marinated it for 30 minutes.

This was delicious!  It was a huge hit.  I was a bit skeptical about the amount of Worchestershire sauce in it, but it worked. No flavours were overwhelming.  Next time I will decrease the honey and brown sugar (maybe just leave one out) and add ginger.

A really complex but delicious flavor for pork chops. I really liked it a lot. Would make it again if it weren't for my picky husband, who didn't care for it. Another reviewer said they tried the marinade on ribs. I think I may be able to talk hubby into giving it another shot with that application.

This marinade was so delicious. At first I felt a little daunted because there are a lot more ingredients than i normally put into something (4 at most usually). The prep was easier than i had expected. my chops only marinated for about 3 hours due to time issues but i could tell it was going to be great! i didnt have a grill so i opted to use a medium heat frying pan trying to only flip once. toward the end i put the rest of the marinade in and within minutes it turned into an amazing glaze. i'm sure i'll do this again and maybe try another type of meat like chicken. oh, i found that agave nectar could sub my *blush* solidified honey, it didnt say which brown sugar to use so i did my dark brown one that i already had,and added more minced garlic because i love it. thanks so much for sharing. this is one of my favorites. 8)

Followed the recipe exactly.  It was delicious and will definitely make again.   It makes a beautiful and appetizing presentation with the sauce drizzled over the pork chops.  Good enough for any night of the week or for company.  I served it with a salad and sweet potato fries.

This was yummy! I’m not an experienced griller so I baked at 350 for 40 minutes, turning and recoating after 20 minutes. Didn’t make any other changes. Next time I’ll get my husband to grill it since I’m sure it’s even better that way!

We thought this was awesome. My kids and boyfriend rated it an 8 or 8.5.  My pork chops were thicker but I didn't want to over cook and the timing was great.  I doubled+ the recipe and marinaded 9 chops and cooked 7 and I'm saving 2 to cook tomorrow.   I added tons more garlic and winged it on the other amounts of the ingredients to make sure it was enough. But I liked it all.   I marinaded for about 3.5 to 4 hours.  I didn't split the sauce and then cooked or boiled the sauce for a while on the stove. I poured it over the pork. It was great.

This marinade is a routine for grilling chops at my house. Superb in every way with my own simple changes I have made over the years. I never go by measuring, as I am a self assuring cook and often go my own route. With this recipe, I cut out the ginger and add twice as much ketchup, replaced the cinnamon with chili powder, 2 cloves of fresh garlic and a few squirts of lemon juice. With these changes this recipe is a keeper.

This will now be my go to marinade! The flavors are awesome. The only thing I did different was chop fresh garlic and ginger. I seared chops in iron skillet then finished in 400 oven for 25mins. ( I  had 2 inch thick chops) I also let them sit in marinade for 24hrs. Tender, moist chops everyone will love.

This recipe made the best pork chops I have ever had. The best thing is the ingredients are easy and I had everything I needed in my fridge and cabinet! My husband LOVES it. I use thin cut pork chops (I personally don't like thick cut), and they still turned out amazing.

AMAZING PORK CHOPS!  I prepared the recipe exactly as instructed, and it is perfection.  No variation required.  The marinade is sweet and savory and spicy at once...an absolute delight to the taste buds.  The "barbecue sauce" that results from heating the remaining reserved marinade should be bottled for purchase.  I'd pay handsomely for it.  Wow!

This recipe is a KEEPER!!  I followed the ingredients to the "T"!  The only thing I did different was marinated for only 30 minutes -- I couldn't wait the 4-8 hours.  I also "grilled" it on the stove in a grill pan that I have and I'm sure that a George Foreman would work wonderfully!  Looking forward to making again and marinating the full time!  The chops were tender and juicy!

Made this exactly as the directions stated, and loved it!  I don't like ginger, but my husband does, so I left that in... was a bit nervous, but it was fine.  My husband said he'd like just a little more heat next time, so thinking of maybe adding some red pepper flakes.

Awesome, even for my picky eater--my husband!!!  I didn't add the ginger yet it was still flavourful and juicy and tender.  Idid let mine marinate however about 7 hours! This marinate will be a staple in our house!!!

A little different taste but was EXCELLENT! Men in my house loved! Used two lbs. of Pork Loin instead & doubled recipe for sauce.Marinated for 6 hrs. We cooked over hot coals on grill (400*) for 10 min on each side, basting both sides with sauce. Wrapped in foil, poked holes in it, & moved to indirect heat on grill. Smoked with pecan & mesquite wood (because were from TX :) Served with cooked sauce as suggested. AWESOME!!!! Would recommend cutting ginger in half though as it was a little over powering, (I added more soy & Worcestershire & toned it down a bit)  Added a can of drained, crushed pineapples to the sauce as well & it was wonderful. May try using the juice from pinapples the next time. Enjoy Yall!!!! :D

This recipe was very easy and very delicious! I did not add any cayenne pepper b/c I was afraid my toddler wouldn't eat it.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly, and my husband LOVED it, as did I....even my picky 15 month old inhaled the pork (she never touches meat!) I served it with brown rice and broccoli...the marinade goes well just to mix into the rice and veggies too! I think I let it marinate for about 5 hours...Thanks for the recipe!

Made exactly as stated in recipe, it was so good I ate it for dinner 2 nights in a row. Definitely recommend only thing I changed was I substituted Worcester sauce with lea n perrins tomato & Worcester sauce combined. I think it added even more flavour.

Great recipe!  I used mine for pork chops which I cooked ahead for sandwiches.  I ended up slicing the chops and dunking the slices into the left-over marinade before reheating.  Delicious!

Great marinade, we made this while camping. I did let them marinate all day long and we heated up the leftover sauce to baste with while grilling. Tender juicy succulent chops with a nice sweet mildly spicy sauce. So easy too!

Very delicious!  The only changes I made was half-ing the cinnamon (do not completely remove from ingredients, it adds a nice change in flavor) and added a pinch more brown sugar.  I would recommend though that when making this recipe that it is better to thicken the basting liquid before glazing the pork on the grill and to double the ingredients.  Not only does thickening it make it stick better, but the flavor is a bit more concentrated.  Otherwise, this recipe is incredible!  I can not wait to make it for my husband the chef!  He will definitely be jealous :)

the chops were very tender. I used half the honey and half the broen sugar. I would not havee liked any more sweetness. In fact I think I will try this again with no brown sugar and half the honey.

I followed the lead of several other reviewers and left out the cinnamon and ginger.  A little ginger might have been OK, but I don't think it wanted cinnamon at all.  I added cumin instead.  It could have used more (about a 1/2 tsp. for 8 chops, I think).  SLightly less soy and Worcestershire would also be fine, as the sauce was just a tad salty.  I would only recommend grilling about 7 minutes before basting and turning, though, as my sauce overcarmelized a bit.
Otherwise, this turned out well.  If the chops aren't overcooked, the dipping sauce isn't entirely necessary.

Skipped the ginger and cinnamon (personal preference) and grilled inside on a grill pan.  Also ended up marinating for 24 hrs.  The bf said they were the best pork chops he's ever eaten.  They'll always be the ones I make from now on!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was excellent.  I don't really care for ginger so I omitted and I didn't have any onion powder so I used 1/3 cup of chopped onion.  My husband and I just loved the flavor.

Our favorite marinate for grilled pork chops.  Thick cut is mandatory.  Usually find great price at Costco when feeding a crowd.  Recipe is for 2 pork chops, so I double/ triple recipe as needed and save some to heat and serve as optional topping.

Pork loin, the other lean white meat, is a great value for the $$ but usually comes  off the grill a bit dry. This recipe helps it stay moist although hubs says watch it because the sugar wants to crisp up. The flavor was excellent. No heat with the combination of flavors so don't skimp on the cayenne. The sauce thickened fast and tasted great as almost a dipping sauce. We will definitely use this recipe again

I make this every time I need a good marinade for chicken. I have never tried this on pork or steak, but I imagine it would be just as delicious! I'm not one to change recipes much, so I typically keep this as the recipe states and it comes out delicious--maybe a little heavier on the garlic and double or triple the recipe just so I have enough marinade to cover the amount of chicken I'm grilling, but again, no real substantial changes. 

I do have to say, a nice tip for this recipe is if I have a can of about 6 oz of pineapple juice around, or if I remember to get pineapple rings to grill along side the chicken, I will throw in the pineapple juice to the marinade that night before for a tasty Hawaiian-type flavor.

I've made these as Hawaiian Chicken sandwiches using boneless skinless chicken thighs because they're more tender and juicy, and dressed them up with my choice of fixin's (lettuce, tomato, mayo, and pickle--maybe some onion straws if you're feeling extra adventurous) that I would put on a regular chicken sandwich, and then added a grilled pineapple ring. It's a bit messy with a cheap bun, but if you have a good solid brioche bun that's toasted, it holds together nicely and it insanely delicious!

I've also made this as a chicken and rice plate type of way. Marinated the chicken as I would with the addition of the pineapple juice, grilled the chicken, steamed some jasmine rice, grilled some pineapple rings, cut up and mixed together the chicken and pineapple and se

This was something different to do with pork.  For my preferences it was a bit to sweet.  Next time i make I would reduce the amount of brown sugar to decrease sweetness.

There is WAY too much sugar in this marinade to use in grilling, especially with thick-cut chops.  Unless you cook them very slowly, they are likely to burn.  The second time I made this, I baked the chops in a 350 degree oven for 8-10 minutes per side.  While baking, I cooked the remaining marinade down - it reduces to a thick, molasses-like sauce.  I brushed the chops with the reduced sauce to give them more color and flavor.  The only changes I made to the ingredients was to reduce the ginger and cinnamon to 1/8 tsp. each so they didn't overwhelm the flavor.  Very good as amended!

It's a good basic recipe, but too sweet for my taste. YMMV. Next time I'll try is with less or no sugar and maybe only a little honey.

The only change I made was to cut the ginger in half. This was the best grilled pork loin chops I have ever eaten. Thanks, will be making again soon.

Great recipe. The sauce is really what makes the dish. There's no need to discard the marinade;  you can just simmer it to kill off any badness.  Also, I thought the ginger was great in this recipe. However, we did cut the amount of cinnamon in half. If you're worried about these spices being too overwhelming, it's probably best to cut them in half, taste, and then determine whether to add more.

We all liked.  It started to storm so we had to bake rather than grill (400 for about 25 min with all the marinade dumper in) and it was great.  Next time I may boil some of the sauce as called for, as it was pretty oily after baking.

Edible? Yes
Make again? No.

I'm guessing it's the cinnamon, but there was a bad aftertaste with these.  I made the recipe as it was written and to the exact amounts specified.

This recipe was very good. I did make one change after reading the reviews before hand, and that was to cut the cinnamon down to 1/8 tsp as I don't care for cinnamon usually other then in desserts. It turned out great, even my son that hates pork chops liked it!

Really tasty and easy. I marinated my chops for just over an hour and it turned out delicious.  Seared/cooked on cast iron (indoors) for 3 minutes each side, then under broiler for 3 minutes.  I did use siracha (1t) and ketchup (1t), rather than the 2t ketchup that was specified.  Served with white rice and balsamic-glazed brussel sprouts which made for a great compliment of tastes.  Oh, and I plated it with just  a few crumbles of goat cheese on the pork, which sent it over the top.  My husband rated it 5 stars.

I made this tonight, and we really enjoyed it!  I made a couple of changes which improved the recipe.  First, since I was grilling the chops and was worried about them being dry, I brined the chops in 4 cups of water and 1/4 cup of salt for two hours.  This makes the chops more moist.  The only other change was to add a little spice to the recipe.  I had a personal bottle of  Tobasco sauce, so I added it to the marinade .  It is 1/8 of an ounce, so it just adds a hint of heat to the marinade.  Great recipe, we'll definitely make it again!!

These were delicious. I loved the flavour. I broiled in oven with thick bone in pork chops. 10 minutes a side after marinating all day.

I have used this recipe several times. It has now become a weekly meal for my husband and me. We love it. The flavor alone is enough without adding the sauce for us. The only thing I do differently is not adding cinnamon.

Due to bad whether, I fried these on the stove rather than grilling them.  Overall, they were still good but they probably would have been better grilled.  My husband loved the sauce and used it as a dip for his French fries!

This is the best pork chop recipe I have ever had! I use Brown Sugar Splenda and half-sugar catsup and it’s AMAZING. I’m a cashier at a grocery store and every time someone buys chops I give them this recipe. Love Love LOVE it! Every Monday is pork chop night. I bake them in the oven at 350 ( drenched in that sauce), for 90 min, the exact time I do the baked potatoes put tin foil over the chops for the first 45 then take it off. I usually quadruple it and make a big garlic jar of this stuff.

meh, it was alright. i would just do a basic asian marinade next time and omit the ketchup (does nothing) brown sugar and worcestire sauce and add lime juice and use fresh minced ginger instead of ground.

I make these pork chops regularly, as this is our favorite recipe for pork chops.  I limit the  cayenne pepper though as it seems to have enough kick with the Worcester.  Now that its difficult to grill due to the weather, I follow the recipe and bake the chops for 30 minutes instead of grilling.  This latest time I sliced the pork loin into thin chops and breaded them using a 3 step approach (dredge in flour with salt & pepper, then dip into egg bowl, then dredge in a mixture of seasoned bread crumbs mixed with Parmesan cheese).  I browned the chops about 3 minutes per side at medium to high heat in a pan with oil, then placed them in a baking dish, and drizzled the sauce all over the chops and baked them at 350 for 30 minutes, flipping them a few times.  Came out great.  We love this sauce, and the breaded chops really soaked up the sauce.

Pretty darn good. Perfect amount of sauce for glazing. I didn’t have honey but used corn syrup. I did only add a 1/4 teaspoon of ginger which seem to be just right.

So good!!!! I threw the marinade into a vacuum sealed bag with the pork chops and made extra to package along with it, then placed it in the freezer for a meal at a later time....I pulled it out last night to defrost and grilled it tonight. I poured the extra packet of sauce and cooked in a saucepan as directed. These were FANTASTIC! My kids (10 & 12) begged for more and my husband hid a porkchop to have for lunch tomorrow! I think I will try this recipe with chicken breast next! Can’t wait.

Omg these were thee best pork chops I’ve ever made! I don’t like pork chops usually (which is why I don’t make them often) but I followed this recipe as written and they came out so good.  Nice a juice and with a really good, not overly sweet, taste.  I’m definitely keeping this in my favorites to make again.

As soon as I tasted the marinade I knew this dish would be delicious.  Fantastic recipe and simple to make.  I doubled the cayenne pepper to 1/4 tsp instead of 1/8 which gave it a bit more of a kick but without making it too spicy.

This is definitely a keeper recipe. Made no changes whatsoever.
Grilled the chops 4mins, turned 45* and grilled another 4mins, turned over and repeated previous 2 steps. Great looking grill marks. Keep in mind, the time depends on the thickness of the chops. Making again today, the wife says OK!

Followed the recipe to the T (rare for me) and it was great..  took the advice of another reviewer and made a stir fry with threat of the marinade..  washed it all down with beer and tequila.

This was super easy and delicious.  The pork chop were juicy.  I did substitute the ketchup with a Hitachi barbecue sauce.

Great summer drink w hints of fruit and herb, with a generous amount of gin thrown in.  Add the sparkling water and you've got a well balanced summer cocktail.  Another round anyone?

I made this exactly as directed, and they were wonderful.  Best to use thick chops, or they can dry out on the grill.

Great marinade for pork!  Very easy and gave a great flavor.  I used this on pork tenderloins and basted several times while it was grilling.  It gave the meat a nice caramelization and flavor.  Will be using this again.  Thank you for the recipe!

Ingredient wise, followed exactly as written. Difference was, instead of grilling them, I broiled them in the oven, and because I did 8 chops  instead of 2, I didn’t have any sauce left to simmer in the saucepan. Ok though, as they Tasted great. Thanks for sharing.

This was very tasty. I cut pork into 2 inch cubes for kabobs. I only had time to marinate for 1 hour but they came out great . I used the leftover marinade as a dip for the pork. I loved the flavor combo, the red pepper added a mice kick.

I decided to try this recipe on a pork loin roast, and oh what a great idea! I doubled the recipe except for the soy which I used 5tbs instead of 6. I marinated the meat in half the liquid for 5 hours before putting it in a roasting pan and on the BBQ. I cooked it at 350F for 1.5 hours, and it was absolutely delicious. Afterwards I stored the remaining meat in a container and added the extra liquids which will marinate it until we eat it.

These were amazing. I didn’t even hear any complaints from my typically picky kids! They were juicy and flavorful, something I find hard to achieve in pork chops. They stuck a little to the grill despite the oil on the grate and there were some pretty charred parts, but I find it didn’t detract at all from the flavor, I actually enjoy a few crispy bits. It lets you know it was cooked on a real live grill. (Camp grill, in my case) super easy to put together and the extra sauce went really well with the pasta we had.

Best Grilled Pork Loins we have ever eaten. We cooked them like we do chicken on the grill. We turn the heat up high and seal in the juices quickly on both sides. Then we either wrap bricks with foil or a cast iron skillet and after searing the pork loin, we turn the heat down low, put the bricks or skillet on top and they are so juicy and tasty. Yum. Wish I would have done the whole pork loin that way but the brine maranade was also good. Just love this marinade!

This is delicious, I've made it a few times and it really adds a lot to a chop. FYI, it's sweet so I usually shake the cayenne a little hard for more kick.

Very good. A little to much ginger. But everyone enjoyed it. I poured some of the sauce over the top and garnished with fresh parsley. I also made fried potatoes and fried mushrooms, bell pepper and garlic. All garnished with fresh parsley.

The glaze should be flagged as Asian Grilled Pork because that is the predominant flavor. I was expecting more American grilled, so all my sides were off. Also, didn't work much as a marinade, either, and the chops were the driest I've ever made.  Good if you want a very mild Asian grilling sauce.

Really good, flavorful pork recipe! I don't have a great grill, so once the marinade crusted the outside (7 minutes on both sides of thick cuts), I cut the chops in half and turned the newly exposed side to the grates to avoid burning the marinade sides and let the internal temperature get to 145. Turned out great, and didn't lose much moisture, thankfully. Will definitely make again.

My pork chops always turn out dry but these were amazing. My twin boys and husband loved them and asked me to definitely make these again. Thank you for the recipe

Delicious!  The sauce was very good tho I didn't use cinnamon. Just used honey and it was plenty sweet for us. I used the dipping sauce on my rice. Yum! My dipping sauce got a little thick so I thinned it with some  pineapple juice. I'll use this on salmon too.

I listened to the other reviewers and lowered the cinnamon and ginger amount to 1/8 tsp.  This was  fantastic even the three year old liked it.  It has a wonderful sweet heat to it.  I will definitely be making this again

I doubled the recipe but the garlic just overpowered the whole thing. I changed a few ingredients due to having no Worcester sauce in (added sriracha & more ketchup). I also reduced the cinnamon & the ginger for personal preference. The rating is based on the level of garlic and not my alterations, can tell it would be full marks with one less clove. Will try again & bear that in mind.

Love these pork chops! I'm not a fan of pork, but my dad loves it. I'm always looking for a new, tastier way to cook pork. My dad complimented the recipe and that is a big deal. I followed the recipe, but cooked them in the oven on a rack. I did not let them marinate for 4-8 hours, just 30 minutes and they were still very flavorful. I did put slices in the pork, so the marinade would get into the meat more. I will use this recipe over and over and over again!

We loved them.  I found the recipe and wanted to try it but knew i didn't have ginger or brown sugar in my cupboards.  It annoys me when people improvise but I had to!!!!!  I substituted a little teriyaki sauce for missing ingredients and they were great.  I marinated them for about 6 hours and I can't wait to make them again.

AWESOME MARINADE! The only reason why I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it's a teensy bit salty. And I like salt. I also cooked it a little differently then grilling that I think makes it spectacular: increase the amount of brown sugar (at least double) also I added extra garlic. I didn't have any pepper flakes so I used a "roasted garlic & herb" seasoning I had on hand. This had sweet red pepper in it instead of the spicy pepper that was called. I also added extra ketchup ( equal amount to the Worcestershire and soy sauce). Then I marinaded it for 24hours. Cooked in stainless steel pan with lid on med heat, added about 4 tablespoons of oil, and poured all the marinade in the pan. The oil helps coat the food with the marinade instead of the pan. Also I would double the marinade if you want to have a good amount extra to drizzle over the meat. Super delicious and will defiantly be adding this as a regular meal. I think chicken would be good with it too

We don't do spice so rather than cayenne I substituted smoked paprika....additionally rather than serving thick chops, I sliced the two chops after grilling as if it was a tenderloin roast...I didn't heat up the extra marinade...I basted the two chops while grilling and then used my basting brush and brushed each slice of meat before serving...it was soo yummy...definitely another recipe that will be made many times.

Made this for dinner tonight. My kids usually complain about the seasoning choices i make for my chops but tonight no one said a word! The marinade is nice and sweet. Did not add any ginger (I personally dont care for it) or red pepper. Did add black peoper. Will be making again for sure.

I've been making this for over a year. It's hubby & I's favorite! Only changes I've made are I use about 1/2 the soy sauce and Instead of ginger & cinnamon I use about 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice. And sometimes I add extra garlic (I'm a freehander instead of exact measurer and we love garlic)

These were very good.  I made exactly as directed except for the cayenne as I don't like that much heat.  The weather turned rainy when it was time to cook so I did them inside on a grill pan and they were wonderful.  Will definitely make again.

I confess, I went a bit rogue with this one.  I didn't have time to marinate the chops, so while they were grilling i mixed the marinade and reduced it to a thicker glaze to drizzle over the chops.  Delicious!  The sauce ended up a bit too sweet for my taste, but that could be my fault due to the reduction.

I've made these twice now and my family just RAVES about how good they are! I had to double the recipe because I was doing twice the chops, but it turned out perfect and I'm still hungry for more! They're definitely on our list of regular dinners!

Had everything except Worcestershire sauce. Instead I used A1 in its place. I know it's not the same and I feel it would have been perfect had I had it but this was great! I hate when people review after tweaking a recipe I only had to sybarite because I didn't have the ingredient. I marinated them for about 4 hours and cooked them on a gas grill and then finished them in the oven. Served them along side twice baked potatoes with chives cheese sour cream and bacon and cut corn from the cob. We loved it, next time I will make it as directed. Make extra to base your chops as you grill them. This is a repeat recipe!!

Wow! these were great! I skipped the ginger and the onion powder. I didn't have any cayenne pepper, so I added a pinch of cajun spice instead. I  let the chops sit in the marinade for about fifteen minutes. I know they should have been in longer, but I didn't have enough time. They still tasted great! We served them with asparagus and fried apples. YUM!

Doubled the recipe for more pork chops. Used only 1/2 of the ground ginger and 1/4 of the ground cinnamon. (If I would have not doubled the recipe I would have used 1/4 of the ground ginger and 1/8 of the ground cinnamon). Put them in the oven for about 40 minutes at 350. Came out with a great flavor! Definitely doing this recipe again!

I made this according to the recipe except eased up on the cinnamon and ginger as suggested by other reviewers.  I liked this OK, didn't blow my socks off.  I doubled the recipe even though I only made 2 large chops.  The last step says to boil the other 1/2 of the marinade and if I hadn't made double, there surely would not have been enough to boil.  Even with doubling it, there was barely enough to boil.

I love this recipe!!  It is a staple in our house. I personally liked the original recipe but my husband didn't.  So I excluded the ginger and cinnamon and added a little extra, like 1 tablespoon of ketchup, and it is great!    Being a busy mom of two, this recipe is so nice as it takes about five minutes to make the marinade and get it in the fridge!

This recipe is moist and delicious. I followed the recipe with no exceptions and the pork chops were great. There wasn't a lot of marinade left over to use as a sauce, but they are delicious even if you don't use the sauce,

This was a nice marinade. I think I'll double it next time as I would have liked a little more to brush over the pork chops after cooking.

I've been looking for a good pork chop recipe and this it!  Delicious and also very attractive.  I only marinated for 2 hours and will do for longer in the future because the marinade is super scrumptious and you want it to really penetrate!

Great recipe, I have used it at least  five times, and it has been I hit everytime.  The only change that I made was on the amount of honey, I cut it down to two tablespoons.

It was a nice change of pace. Because I like sauce I would double it next time. Also let the sauce sit for about 5 min and it will thicken on standing

I don't normally make pork chops.  I'm not a fan of them but my husband is so I make them occasionally.  I can honestly say I will be making them more with this recipe.  They were phenomenal.  Thank you for sharing.  I didn't and wouldn't change a thing.

Amazingly delicious marinade (that was all I used and didn't do any of the cooking instructions). Only got to marinade for an hour as I was in a pinch, but still insanely tasty. Will definitely be naming again!

This was very tasty!  Based on other reviews I cut the ground ginger down to 1/8 tsp and i only had 1 T of Worcestershire sauce on hand so I added 2 T of water.  The marinade still had plenty of flavor. It was too cold to grill so I pan seared the chops and then baked them at 375 until they hit 160.  I also reserved about half a cup of the marinade and combined that with some sliced onion sauteed in butter, which I served on top of the chops. Will definitely make this again!

This was great.  The only "change" I made was that I didn't have Worcestershire Sauce so I made it from scratch.  I guess that wouldn't actually be a change.  I would recommend this recipe as is or with homemade Worcestershire Sauce.

I did it pretty much exactly as the menu called for except the grill is put away for the winter so browned a little in a fry pan with salt and pepper then added the ingredient and baked. Husband loved it.

I used fresh ginger since I had some on hand and I didn't get the ratio down right.  Ginger was way to overpowering.  Next time I will make this recipe as is because it was very good.  Or, I will cut back the amount of fresh I use.

Best. Marinade. Ever.

Seriously though i make this at least once a week. I will advise you to cut back on the ginger unless you really love it.

I bought a whole loin at Costco and cut it into thick steaks, about  1 1/2".  Picture a piece of 2X4 lumber which is actually 1.5", that thick.  I put two steaks into each of several food saver vacuum bags and freeze them.  They stay good for months!

I did not alter this recipe at all.  I put 2 loin chops with half the marinade in a food saver vacuum bag and refrigerated in the morning before work so it marinated for about 11 hours.  I grilled on a hot grate with indirect heat for about 7-8 minutes per side total, turning and saucing a couple of times.  They were moist and delicious.  I believe the marinade acts as a brine, infusing moisture into the meat.  I heated/reduced the reserved marinade on the stove top and wish I had just a bit more than I did.
Will certainly make this again.

This was a wonderful recipe! I only changed it, because of ingredients I had on hand or didn't have. The changes were: Added freshly grated ginger (2 TBSP), doubled the garlic, chipotle powder (a dash), smoked paprika (1 TBSP), a cup of a mixture of apple cider and ginger ale. I didn't add ketchup, onion powder, cayenne or ground ginger.

I cooked it on the stove top in my iron skillet and it turned out wonderful.  I also didn't measure any of the ingredients so my recipe wasn't exact but it still turned out great. Thank you for this recipe.

I made this and it was awesome. I didn't have the onion pepper or cayenne pepper so instead I used some Tony's and complete seasoning only because I felt is was the closest thing in the cabinet. I think it would be great in chicken and kabobs. I will definitely make it again.

Followed the recipe exactly and marinated chops for ten hours.  Cooked on my gas BBQ and they turned out  very moist but  just a little sweet for my taste. Will definitely  make again with a little less  sugar and honey. I highly  recommend using a digital meat  thermometer,  and sticking close to the grill to watch for  the inevitable flare ups.

This dish is absolutely delicious!  I substituted teriyaki for the soy sauce as suggested in the video.    This recipe will be used often.  I'm going to try it with chicken, too.

No changes. Because the sauce is "flavor-heavy" I went light with a side and fixed new potatoes, red onion, orange bell pepper, zucchini, and yellow squash....put them in a Ziploc with olive oil, lemon juice and a little rosemary and mixed. Then wrapped in foil with fresh cracked pepper and course sea salt and grilled. Both turned out awesome!

I seared pork loin in a pan and  add the leftover marinade sauce and wrapped it with foil , bake 350F for 30 mins. It was really moist and tender with grilled kind of look. Served with twice baked potato and cooked carrot/beat dressing with balsamic vinegar and olive oil.

The marinade is delicious! We did both chicken tenders and pork sirloin chops. Made with amino acids , instead of soy sauce, since daughter is celiac and gluten free, still, very, very good! Will make this again!

my family loved this. We had no plates that  were not empty and my grandkids usually do not finish what they are served. I used pork loin chops bone in and other than I needed larger bags for the bone in it was great. I made 12 chops and. Just multiplied the recipe.

These were awesome. I even found myself sneaking out in the night to eat them. Added some taco sauce packets, and honey sauce packets, (just trying to get rid of them)....and a packet of the red cayenne pepper you get from Pizza Hut. Awesome!! Forget to add ginger this time but will next time. Marinade fabulous too. :)

This is a delicious marinade! I only wish I had read the comment that flows the recipe. My boneless chops were rather thick and cutting them into cubes would have added the flavor of the marinade. I'll do that the next time. This is one of my Allrecipes.com favorites.

Yummy! Omitted cayenne, used 1/4 tsp ginger, sprinkle of cinnamon.  Marinated 2 chops 4 hours. Boiled the leftover marinade for additional dip. Don't forget to oil the grill...

Tried this one last summer and it's been a seasonal staple ever since. I cut the ginger in 1/2 at first and now omit it entirely because there's already enough flavour going on. Serve with sweet corn on the cob and apple sauce. Gnom!

My family loved this!  In particular, my 11 year old thought the flavor was amazing.  I used it on a family size pack (8-10 pieces) of ½ inch chops.  I tripled the ingredient amounts which left enough to marinate, baste, and have sauce on the side (yum!).  Cutting the grilling time down to 5-6 min per side for the thinner chops kept them tender & moist.  We also love grilled sweet potatoes and think it will be fabulous on those as well.  This will become one of our grilling staples in the summer!

I made these chops as directed, did not change a thing. I thought the spices in the marinade were just right, my wife and I thought the flavor was very good. I have to learn not to over cooked them on the grill, but that's my problem. I did 8 minutes per side on my gas grill over medium heat and they came out a little dry. Next time I'll lower the time to 7 minutes per side and maybe lower the heat some.

My husband, daughter & I loved this recipe. The only thing I didn't add was cayenne. My husband, who does not particularly like cinnamon, went back for more as did my daughter.  In fact, it was so tasty, my daughter now has the recipe. I will definitely make this again.  I love being adventurous when it comes to food!

There is a reason this recipe has received so many rave reviews; it is great! I ended up using the whole marinade on four pork chops. Made another 1/2 batch of marinade for basting. My husband loved it and asked for it again.

Made it for a dinner party & everyone loved them!  Moist, tasty, delicious!  One guest had a pork allergy, so I made her a boneless chicken breast, & it worked great!  Didn't like the way the chops were cut in the store, so I bought a center loin roast & cut it up myself.  Definitely a keeper!

My husband loves them! I did make some changes to it. I use maple syrup instead of honey and add tablespoons of ketchup versus teaspoons. I hear the sauce with onions and mushrooms and add to slightly browned chops in a skillet. This sauce is so amazing I usually always double the recipe!

Made it exactly as shown. Seriously great marinade. Basting with the extra marinade made an awesome glaze on the pork. I think it would also be amazing on chicken. Yumm!!!

This was delicious and we barely had time to let it properly marinate.  Served with baked beans and grilled pineapple slices which made for a nice company meal in the summer.

Did not baste as called for.  Did use reserve marinade as a sauce when chops were done.  Pretty darn good.

These are awesome! Though be careful with the cinnamon as it can torpedo the dish if you use even a little bit above a pinch or so.

My family thought the pork chops were tender. However, the flavors of honey and the ginger were not a hit with my family.

The sauce with this recipe is the greatest.  After gathering all the ingredients together I wondered what I was making.  I continued to turn and baste the meat while on the grill.  The finished produce was just wonderful.  A combination of pork and sauce. When using this recipe in the future I will increase the amount of each ingredient so I'll have more sauce to baste with.  I'll recommend this to my friends.

Excellent recipe, fast and easy. I only marinaded for an hour because of time constraints. My husband and I loved it.  Complaints about the spices is puzzling, the amounts are so small I don't know how people can complain. I left out the cayenne as I don't like food that burns my tongue. So If you don't care for one of the ingredients put in less or substitute something else.

Perfect just the way the recipe is. Maybe a couple teaspoons of sriracha because our family likes spicy, but this is now my favorite marinade. I can't wait to try this on shrimp too!

I took a pork loin and cut it up into chops. We used all of the ingredients except for the cayenne pepper, doubled the sauce, and  marinated over night. My husband grilled the chops and they were moist, flavorful, and tender. I will definitely be using this recipe again.

I have made this 3 times now. It is our new, favorite way to gill pork chops! It is a FANTASTIC marinade...thank you for sharing! The first two times I made them, I only marinated for about 2 hours. The third time the chops marinated for 6 hours - and boy what a difference the extra time makes! As I type, I have made up a new batch (with double the honey as we like the gooey char it creates on the grill) to marinate overnight . LOVE THIS!

I made this exactly to the recipe and it came out great, even though I didn't marinade it long enough. I'll correct that next time and I'm sure it will be even better.

Very good marinade,  doubled recipe for extra chops.  Substituted smoked paprika for cayenne due to dietary constraints and omitted the cinnamon ( just not a fan of it on meat).  For grilling would recommend indirect heat ( coals on one side meat on the other) I believe the sugar makes is easy to burn.   Finish off over coals to get those fantastic grill marks  and glaze.

Please note the recipe says to "discard" the marinade, but in the same step, directs us to baste with the marinade and in the last step directs us to use the reserve marinade to make a sauce.

Turned out very good! Didn't add cinnamon or cayenne. Added Moscato white wine and a squeeze of sweet BBQ sauce (which was served with dinner along with steamed sweet potato, potato, spinich, broccoli). So delicious. Will be adding this to dinner recipe rotation.

I loved this recipe.  Very tasty!  Left out the cayenne pepper and recommend making extra sauce to go over chops after they are cooked.  I made six chops and tripled the marinade/sauce recipe and felt I still needed a little extra for dipping.

Doubled the sauce except for the cinnamon.  Only had 30 minutes or so to marinade and forgot about the extra sauce for basting.  I boiled the extra as recipe states and we used it for dipping.  It was good!

This was a great start but I thought the sauce tasted too much like a bbq sauce. I added pineapple juice, olive oil, liquid smoke, and fresh squeezed lime juice. With these additions it was fabulous!

I haven't actually cooked the pork yet but the marinade is amazing! I didn't have brown sugar so I used white sugar instead. Didn't have honey so I decided to replace that with Hoison Sauce. I did everything else the same and my boyfriend and I have been licking the bowl ever since. Can't wait to actually cook the pork..or um anything in this. You could put it on a flip flop and it would taste good!! Thanks for sharing this wonderful marinade :)

Awesome flavor and made my house smell amazing! I doubled the recipe...but should not have doubled the cayenne. Little hot for my taste buds, which are fairly weak. My toddler approved so that's always a plus!

I did make changes to this and it turned out great. I used your marinade, it sounded delicious and it was. I had 3 to make so I adjusted the marinate proportionatly. I was running low on time so I only marinated for 2 hrs but messaged the meat frequently, about every 20 min. I pan fried the pork for about 8 min per side and finished them in the oven at 325 for about 15 or 20 min (the time it took to make Mac n cheese for a side). I drizzled the marinate on the pork before it went into the oven. they probably would've been good by themselves, but making the sauce out of the marinate is what took this from good to great. in conclusion I was happy with myself on being able to compromise, but I was very happy with your marinate. all in all this recipe took about 45 min not including the time to soak in the juices.

I only had pork chops at hand and the recipe came out great. I did not put the ginger and the cinnamon due to the brown sugar already being sweet and the cayenne pepper giving the kick. Either way it came out great !!!

Very good! Sauce was enough for 3-4 boneless chops about 1" thick. Used fresh ginger and reduced cinnamon to about 1/8 tsp but all would have been ok. Marinaded overnight.

Followed the recipe as written, which is unlike me. I almost always make changes. The concoction sounded interesting so I decided to stay true to the original poster’s intent. One-inch chops marinated in the stuff for 24 hours and then placed on an oiled grate on a Big Green Egg set to 375F. 8 minutes per side and I enjoyed some of the most flavorful chops ever. Highly recommend.

simply delicious! I have made this a few times and it was amazing every time!  the Ladd time I added extra cayenne for a little more kick, it was MONEY! A perfect little bite on the end.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

Turned out juicy and really good on my infrared grill.  Didnt really prepare the simmered sauce so I assume the chop can only get better. Would definitely recommend.

Husband said these were the best grilled chops ever. 2nd time I made this, I tripled the recipe to ensure we would have leftovers. Unexpected company stopped by and couldn't stop raving about how good these were. I cut back on the brown sugar and honey a bit, since I'm not crazy about sweet marinades, but kept everything else the same. Great on pork loin chops!

Made these a few times during the summer and everyone loved them.    A lot of ingredients but I think most people have most of them around the kitchen.    Sweet, tastey and even picky eaters had seconds.    I bet the sauce would be great on chicken and shrimp as well!

This is a really great recipe. I use teryaki sauce instead of Worcester. only because I didn't have Worcester the first time I make it and it turned out great. This is also great for putting into freezer bags to have later

This was awesome!!! I made 4 chops (some for leftovers), increased the amounts and switched it up just a bit. I used garlic powder, minced dried onions and Sriracha chili sauce instead of ketchup (used a lot more too :-) omitted the cinnamon and cayenne. It came out just like the picture! Never used thick chops before but it's essential for this recipe...THANKS!

Wow! this recipe was great.  I was looking for a something different to do with pork chops and came across this recipe.  It was delicious, I doubled the recipe to make 6 chops. It was definitely a hit with my family, they were licking their fingers and going for seconds and even thirds.  Thank you for this one I will be using it again.

This was delicious.  I made the recipe as is, except I used fresh minced ginger instead of powdered.  Cut the chops into kabob chunks and marinated for 24 hours.  Grilled kabobs and then tossed cooked kabobs in the hot sauce.  Everyone loved it.  Will definitely make again.

Surprisingly sweet, I thought the soy and Worcestershire sauce would take over but it didn't. I think I used a little more ginger and garlic than what was called for but was very good. Will make again.

Had to throw them on the Foreman cuz we were out of propane. I would have preferred the grill, but still great! AND I only had time to marinate them for an hour. Served over mashed potatoes and sauteed veggies. Thank you!

I think this is a terrific marinade! Unless you dislike the individual ingredients entirely, I suggest sticking to the recipe. The ingredients marry well together for a nice flavor, even with the ginger and cinnamon. I used a 3lb pork loin and tripled the marinade (2/3 to marinade; 1/3 to dip and drizzle). I marinated the pork for 4 hours. I chose not to grill mine; instead I sliced the marinated pork loin into 2" thick medallions, seared them on all sides in a deep skillet, and then simmered on a dim flame for about 10-15 min. It was delicious!

This was FANTASTIC!  Hubby is not a pork fan, but I'm from Iowa, so I had some Iowa Chops in the freezer that this seemed perfect for.  It was!  I used less of the "strong" spices, and I didn't have catsup, so I subbed 1T BBQ sauce and 1T tomato sauce.  Husband loved it, I loved it, and it's definitely a keeper!

Really tasty and moistened the meat beautifully, the one downside was that the marinade was slightly runny but that was user error!

OH, YUM!  Chops were so flavorful and moist on the grill.  I prepared exactly as written, perfect!  Next time I'll prepare a little more sauce, so good!  Thanks for sharing your recipe with AR.

Absolutely amazing! With 2 feet of snow on the ground I wasn't going to grill. I baked it instead. 400 degrees for a little over an hour did the job.  The kids poured the juice over their veggies and couldn't get enough. Next time I'll try it with chicken.

This is a very tasty recipe even enjoyed by my pickiest family member. Is a great quick dish for a working mom. And was very easy to prepare. With ingredients we typically already have in our pantries, which I really appreciated. Except for the Cayenne that iGoogle could be substituted with either paprika or chili powder. Which I did a little bit of both. And just put it into the broiler.

My 5 and 6 year old sons loved this dish! Normally dinner time is moaning and groaning about what I am serving, but this dinner called for seconds. I didn't have soy sauce so just left it out and the recipe turned out great.

Enjoyed the flavors a lot except for a too-heavy ginger taste. We do a lot of marinades and a lot of pork chops, and this one is being added to the rotation (sans the ginger!).

My family loved these and asked me to make again. Bc my son's carbohydrate intake is medically restricted, I did modify a few ingredients. They were Splenda brown sugar in place of the regular (but only use half the amount of the Splenda brown sugar). In place of the honey I used 1/2 sugar free syrup and 1/2 Splenda. I also used low sugar ketchup. We served with rice and cauliflower  rice. Delicious!!

Tasty, savory, sweet on the front, chewy on the middle, and a smooth finish. I would cook them until I was tired of eating them! I didn't have honey so I added an extra 1 tablespoon of brown sugar.

I used what I had on hand...sirloin chops. Mixed the marinade short of the ginger and (most of) the Worcestershire sauce that I did not have on hand. Added a good pinch of salt, pepper and ground mustard. Marinated just long enough for the chops to come to close to room temperature. Grilled for color on high 5 minutes per side, slathering the rest of the marinade each time I turned them. A good mix of flavors and very easy to make quickly when using thinner cut chops. Good job!

Perfect - Easy - Unbelievably delicious.  Grilled on the Weber with Apple Wood smoke.   Watch the time and temp. closlely - 12 minutes per side is too long.

Best I have ever made!  We used bone-in pork chops and did them on a propane grill.  Looking forward to trying them on charcoal, but the timing for cooking was perfect.  Only change to the recipe I made was that I adjusted it to 6 servings and added about 3T of sweet chilli sauce.  I am not sure that it made all that much difference, but it was soooooooo good.  This will be my go-to marinade and sauce for all grilled meats now!  I bet it would even be good on fish!

Just tried this for supper...and was amazed by how good it was! I don't often leave comments on recipes but this one was so fabulous I just had to say so, especially since I followed the recipe exactly. My husband said it was "by far" the tastiest pork chop he has ever had in his life! Thank you ScorpioGG!

Delicious marinade for pork! Served it to a large family and everyone raved about the flavor of the sauce and tender pork chop. I followed other suggestions and decreased the ginger by half. This is definitely one we will repeat!

I left out the cayenne pepper just because I was out. This was exquisite moist, juicy and a wonderful flavor. My chops were a little thinner so I adjusted the cooking time. Will certainly make these again!

Very good.  Center cut pork loin. I made 3, 1-1/2 chops.  A very nice sweet flavor.  Make sure you remove from grill when they hit 145 degrees. That is the key to very juicy chops.

Delicious!   Grillin' again tonight.   I didn't have onion powder and used fresh ginger root last time.  I'm going to marinade longer today.   We only had two hours last time and it was wonderful.    Served w Royal Blend rice.  Mmmmmmm

This is very similar to my Wolfgang Puck recipe for baby back ribs except way easier!!!  We were worried the sweet sauce would burn on the bbq, so we just grilled the chops on the bbq with salt and pepper.  Then, we drizzled the sauce that we had simmered over the pork chops.  Delicious!

Excellent way to grill pork chops.  Everyone liked them and there was a bit of spice with the Worcestershire sauce.

I made this omitting the cinnamon ( I am not a fan of that spice in dishes other that dessert ) and it was absolutely delicious!!! I am currently marinating chicken with same ingredients but I used less ginger this time. I can't wait to eat it on chicken. It was absolutely Wonderful on pork

This is actually a 4 1/2 star.  My husband gives it a 4, I say 5. He thought it was a little too sweet,  I thought it was perfect!   So next time I'll reduce the sugar a tad bit.   Didn't change anything,  the pork chops were super tender and tasty!   It's a keeper!

I made this for the family tonight, and everyone loved it. Tangy sweet with a bit of bite. I reduced the sauce a little too much and had to reconstitute it with some worcestire. Highly recommend this recipe.

This was delicious! I modified it a little bit to make more spicy, did teriyaki instead of worcestershire sauce and used thin cut pork chops and it turned out really good! My husband, who isn't a fan of teriyaki OR spicy food loved it! Will def be making again.

The whole family loved this.  I didn't oil down the grill and they stuck a bit due to the sugar, but had great grill marks and super tender.

Well, it was probably more of a grilling problem...the honey in the glaze is very flammable so I had charred chops the first time. Watch them closely! Second try was better!

I ended up marinading the pork chops for 12 hours and was worried it might be too long but it turned out fantastic! I made it exactly to recipe (except foot the extra marinade time) and they were awesome! Thanks for the best pork chop recipe ever!

Really tasty. I used this on a tenderloin instead of chops because that's what I had and my husband loved it. I will be using this marinade again!

Marinated for 4 hours and my family loved it. I can't wait to try it with a thinner chop, marinated for even longer.... Delicious!

Fantastic flavor - even if you don't measure the ingredients exactly.
