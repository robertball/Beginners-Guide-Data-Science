This is authentic, clearly from someone that knows what this is supposed to taste like. However, if you make it as is, it will be a little too thick and with 5 habanero peppers it will definitely be too spicy for MOST palates. 

That said, we did make it as is but we added a half cup of water to make more of a sauce consistency and we added 3 tablespoons of brown sugar for a spicy-sweet taste. Add brown sugar 1 tablespoon at a time until you get the consistency you like. 

Also, recipe didn't say to blend at the very end. We did to get a completely smooth sauce. It was delicious!

I also added water and brown sugar to the sauce. It has quite a kick. At first taste you get the mango and the sweetness and then the heat hits. Not too hot, but I used four peppers instead of five.

Well seeing how I made this sauce on a extreme budget. I pre-seasoned the chicken then baked it so while it was baking I used mango nectar concentrated, red pepper flakes an banana peppers for some extra kick ,an some garlic with paprika for that colored sauce ??
