Used Asiago Cheese instead, topped with Italian Bread Crumbs as well...for an added veggie, you can also add some fresh spinach leaves!

VERY SUCCESSFUL EASY GOOD.   Worked well for me.
Simple recipe to make. I needed fast dinner for grandchildren
before Christmas pageant, plus a dish for potluck. I doubled,
addded spinach and peas. Perfect for both occasions.
People also made favorable comments.

Followed this recipe as written... Will not be making again. My boys didn't like it either! I have to say the quality of the recipe probably has alot to do with the brand of meatball used... I would much rather make meatballs from scratch and throw in a slow cooker and serve with pasta. The noodles absorb all the sauce and it's dry and bland. The cheese cooks on top like a blanket.
