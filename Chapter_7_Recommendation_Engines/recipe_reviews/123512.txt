I just loved this recipe. Someone on the recipe buzz recommended this recipe to me. They taste like a mix between fudge, frosting, and peanut butter balls. I used my smallest mixing bowl and melted the butter in the microwave then stirred in the rest of the ingredients as suggested. I used my 1 Tbsp. cookie scoop and made level scoops that I divided into two. I flattened each half into a 1" by 1/4" circle. I was able to get 10 buttons. I put them on a piece of foil and put the sheet in the refridgerator to set. It is a nice quick way to feed a chocolate or dessert craving. I will definitely make these when my neice and nephew come to visit. They should be able to do the whole recipe by themselves! TY

YUM! These are so good! Not only is this an incredibly easy recipe, it is also delicious! However, this fudge is also very addictive; you can't stop at just one piece! This is a great recipe for those times when you need a quick, easy and tasty treat!

This was a very simple recipe and tasted good. I would recommend sifting the powdered sugar seems how it's not boiled. I ended up with a couple little clumps of sugar in mine.

These are SO easy and sooooo yummy. I made a triple batch and for the very last step, I added about 1/4 cup of mini-chocolate chips. (They are actually ice cream "toppers" and are super mini.) My Sunday School kids - 4th & 5th graders - LOVED them. I saved a few for home... and.... OH MY! They are SO good. The whole family fought over the handful that I kept, lol. I will most definitely be making these again and next time, I'm going to try a batch with Nutella in place of the peanut butter. I KNOW it will be fantastic. SUPER happy with this addition to my recipe box!

This fudge tastes so good! It is very rich so I do recommend making them into bite sizes. I'm not a fan of the shape or presentation of these so I'm trying to think of a better way. The batter was too runny when I made it as written but adding more confectioner's sugar fixed the problem.

These are awesome! So very easy to make too. It only took me about 10 minutes (if so much) to whip up a batch of these. I melted the butter in the microwave and proceeded from there. The "dough" is very easy to work with and is not messy at all to roll into balls. I then flattened them on the wax paper and stuck them in the fridge immediately. I can see why these need to be in the fridge. They start to get softer as soon as you let them sit outside for a couple minutes. I agree with other reviewers, definitely double or even triple the batch cause it is so hard to stop at just one! Very quick and easy snack when you want something sweet.

This is an excellent recipe to satisfy a sweet tooth with ingredients you always have in your kitchen. I rolled the dough into balls straight out of the bowl and flattened them into discs onto wax paper, which seemed the easiest way to prepare them. They tasted pretty good, considering the time it takes to make them (next to none!) with hardly any clean up involved. If I make these again, I might try drizzling chocolate over them to fancy them up a bit. Otherwise, a great little treat to have around the house. Seems like it would be an easy recipe to make with kids involved. I'd also recommend doubling this recipe if you are making them for more than one or two people, or would like to keep them around for more than a day.

I was craving fudge and wanted to try this recipe since I had everything in the house.  I followed the directions to a T and the batter was super runny!!  There was no way it would have set at room temperature so I had to throw it in the fridge.  The taste is okay.  I may make it again later but the runny batter really turns me off!

WOW, so yummy yet so easy! I increased the cocoa and decreased the peanut butter, which is what suits my tastes. This is perfect for an emergency chocolate craving.

It was delicious, after I changed the recipe. I measured the ingredients meticulously and replayed the process in my head a dozen times after I ended up with a very well blended bowl of dry crumbles. I added another half tablespoon of butter and tripled the milk content and finally got something I could press into a solid form and cut with a knife.  We ate the whole batch in one night though. I will be making my functional version again.

My 4 year old son and I made these today and they are AWESOME! I had to do most of the stirring since it's so thick but he helped roll them into balls and push them down into buttons. The ONLY thing we changed was DOUBLING the recipe and I'm really glad we did! (For those who say the recipe was too thin- did you remove the pan from the heat once the butter was melted? We had zero problems.) Thanks for the wonderful recipe Ann!

I made these for the first time today - they turned out amazing! Not only were they INCREDIBLY easy to make, they taste really good, too! I didn't have any confectioners sugar so I just used splenda that I had on hand - they still taste amazing! These are going to be great Christmas gifts!

5* for quick and easy, 4.5* for taste but that's just preference. I read a review that said perfect if you like choc and p/butter....true, but i'm not sure i like them mixed up to the extent that i can't distinguish either!lol.  Then again, it is still really yum, and because it's so easy to put together and quick I would def make again when craving something sweet.. Drop with TEASPOONSFUL, and make little balls so that its not sooo rich.

This could not have been easier! Like others, I used the microwave and went from there. I don't think it even took 5 mins. Two good suggestions I got from reading the other reviews are to sift the confectioners sugar and add a little extra so your "batter" won't be too runny. I stuck them in the freezer and they set up in just a couple of minutes. Oh yeah, and they tasted fantastic!

My ONLY complaint about these is that mine were VERY runny.  I even let them set up in the pan for a bit.  Once I spooned them onto a plate put them in the fridge they eventually sat up.  They're very good and perfect for two!

Could anything be easier?!   I use a large size glass measuring cup and mix all ingredients in it, starting by melting the butter in the micro.... if yours seems runny (it should be soft but hold a ball type shape) add more powered sugar, a little at a time, to stiffen mixture.... I could hardly put them in the fridge, I want to eat them NOW!  YUMMY

Apparently I've forgotten how to multiply. I doubled the recipe but added too much milk. Had to put all of the mix on a flat pan and make one big piece, then had to freeze it to get it to set up enough to handle ... but omg YUM. I also used crunchy peanut butter and dark cocoa, and sprinkled a little sea salt across the top for the sweet & salty taste. Absolutely delicious. If you add even more milk, this could make an incredible cake frosting too!

I tripled recipe which yielded 24 buttons. Very rich and buttery. One kid says they're okay, the other hates them. Will not make again. Sorry

I think these tasted good and they were easy to make.  They were creamy little things, very addictive! This recipe does not make much at all, so I ended up making 2 batches.  A nice recipe when you want something sweet and don't want to spend a lot of time making it!

We've been making these little fudgy pieces of heaven for years.  One batch is NEVER enough, so I usually double (or triple) the recipe!  I better go make a couple of batches right now!

These were the perfect little chocolate fix late at night when you don't have a lot of ingredients on hand. I rated the recipe 4 stars as-is because I tasted the fudge when it first came together and it seemed a little boring and one-note. So I stirred in a pinch of cinnamon and just a little bit if sea salt. That totally did it. I will absolutely make these again and again.

We love these.  So simple and fast.  I've made this with my grandchildren, doubling the recipe and letting them figure the correct amounts, measure and form the buttons.  We have a fun time together in the kitchen, a math lesson, and a delicious payoff.  Thank you for a yummy recipe.
