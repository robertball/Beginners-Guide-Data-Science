Pretty good, and I will probably use it as a base for future dishes. I added shredded carrots and water chestnuts, and served with Udon noodles.

Too sweet still with half of the sugar required for the recipe. Needs more ginger flavor and pepper.

I used wild ginger root and chives instead of green onions.  I also added some carrots.  Really easy to make and my girlfriend loved it.
