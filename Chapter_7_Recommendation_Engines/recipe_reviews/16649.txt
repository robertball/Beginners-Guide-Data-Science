This was a great basic recipe that has alot of room for variation.  I added 3 cloves of chopped garlic and used chicken stock instead of veggie stock. I also used about 1/4 cup white wine. I love the idea of using the oil from the sundried tomatoes to saute the onions and garlic. I reduced the cheese to 1 cup and used asiago instead of parmesan  or mozzarella.  I will definetly make this again maybe adding some kalamata olives  or artichokes at the end. I think feta cheese would be really good too. I served it with grilled asparagus and marinated pork tenderloin.

We loved this-served it with Feta Chicken and it was a smash.

We really liked this recipe, but made the following changes:
1. Added chicken (I wanted to make this a main dish)
2. Used gorgonzola instead of mozzarella cheese

I will definitely use this recipe again as a main or side dish!

This was well worth the effort.  However, I would recommend using less cheese as it was a bit overpowering.  I also used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth and I was extremely pleased with the outcome.

This was good, however I needed more than stock than what the recipe called for. Also, 2 cups of cheese is WAY too much. I'd say maybe a half cup total would have been plenty.

This was just okay.  It didn't need the extra salt.  Kind of bland and the texture was a little funky.  Next time I'll try another type of cheese.

Though the flavor was very good (I'm a lover of sun dried tomatoes), the rice did not cook as was expected in the recipe.  I ended up using 6 cups of vegetable stock plus an additional cup of water and the rice still had not cooked properly and did not have the creamy texture that risotto is supposed to have.  Also, when it was finished cooking it was incredibly thick and a bit too aldente.  Overall, it was a lot of work for a not so great turnout.

Simple recipe to follow! This was my first attempt at a risotto.. I found the prep time a bit longer than indicated and also found that the rice took longer to cook than stated. I needed extra liquid, so added in a cup of white wine - worked a treat!

I wanted the risotto for a main dish, so added in zucchini and grilled chicken, which made it extra tasty.

I took the advice of previous reviewers and halved the amount of cheese - this was a good hint, as it would have been overpowering otherwise..

I was very pleased with this recipe.  I am an impatient cook so I just dumped some broth in, let it soak up and the rice was still a bit chewy so I added some more broth ice cubes until they weren't chewy.  Next time maybe I'll add chicken to make it a meal.  Very good and easy.

Great recipe. However, it takes much longer than the suggested time to prepare. I was adding the vegetable stock for about an hour or more. I also decided to take the advice from the otehr reviews and use less cheese. I only used a half cup of each, but found this to STILL be too much. I would advise on using 1/4 cup of each cheese at most, and adding more sundried tomatoes. otherwise, it was a fun recipe, and easy for a first-time risotto maker like myself!

My boyfriend is a huge fan of risotto so he asks me to cook it all the time.  I found this recipe which is different from my regular recipe.  I love cheese and sun-dried tomatoes and they gave it good flavor.  The oil packed tomatoes give it a richness and colors the whole thing orange!  I thought the cheese was very stringy and kinda offsetting, but it was very tasty and would probably make it again, but only if he asked me.  I will stick with my grandmas recipe.  Thanks though- it is very good.

This risotto was outstanding! I prepared it with chicken broth, and I used 1/2 c parmesan and 1/2 c mozzarella cheese.  Just delicious! It has the exact amount of salt needed also.

I had a hard time deciding if I liked this recipe when it was done. It SOUNDED great. But I encountered issues with the rice being undercooked (I have no idea how as it is a long cooking process) and the finished product is actually quite flavorless. I was thinking it would be a nice "caprese" style, savory dish with the tomatoes, basil and mozzarella. It ended up being a bit sweet, actually - not at all what I expected. It wasn't absolutely disgusting or anything, just rather bland and all around a bit of a dud. 
I added a lot of salt and it helped a little, but in the end none of my family really liked it (aside from the bit we picked at). This recipe also makes a HUGE amount of risotto!!! Plenty for 6+ people!

I scaled by half but ended up using 1 quart of organic veggie broth.  Will use more tomatoes next time, personal preference.

This is a great recipe to start with. The cheese is too much if your looking for a true risotto. My Italian Grandma taught me to use a 3 to 1 ratio of stock to rice......and then she would add some more stock "just for the heck of it....you can never have too much"!!!!  The outcome of the texture depends of cook. A true Risotto is high maitance....you can't leave it til it's done. "mushy" usually means the rice wasn't either "browned" enough to start or too much stock was added. It can take several trys to get it perfect.....but it's so worth it!!!!

I must begin this review by clearly stating that I am a HUGE dairy fan and have never in my life encountered a recipe that had too much cheese.  That said, this recipe is overwhelmed by a gluttony of cheese .  I love each of the flavors - but it was overkill.  So sad.

I made this last night for dinner--Delicious!  This is a main dish in itself, no need to add anything else.  I kept my mozzarella in cubes so that it didn't melt completely, and also used only about 1/2 cup of parmesan which was plenty.  I would make this again.

I'm sorry -- I hate to give a bad review, but I did not like this recipe at all.  I really thought it was going to be wonderful since I enjoy all of the ingredients it contains.  However, after after I added the cheese to the dish, it became a huge solid hunk of goo that didn't even taste anything special.  In the end, it was a waste of food, not to mention time and effort.

I scaled this for 4 servings and found it each person could have a generous 2 cups. I opted for vacuum packed sun-dried tomato rather than oil packed and used nonstick cookware to cut back on the fat. Lower fat cheeses also. I chose to embellish since the listed version looked a bit plain.

I added 2 oz chopped green onion, 1/4 tsp. oregano, garlic, and 1/2 tsp pepper. Capers would have been a welcome addition but I didn't have any on hand. I found this took extra water and about 35 min to be really done. 

The results were a hit because it was like "pizza rice!" Spouse suggested adding vegetarian "sausage" crumbles and instead of stirring in the cheese, put the rice in  a casserole, cover with the cheese and slip under the broiler until melted so it really would be "pizza rice."

Definitely would make this again.

I have to say that every Risotto I've ever made has failed dismally until tonight!  This one was great.  Absolutely gorgeous.  Really tasty.  Even my picky hubby said how nice it was.  Yes it took some work, but it was well worth it.  

The only things I did different was to use wafer thin slices (done with a potato peeler) of Parmesan instead of grated Parmesan.  And I saved some for the end to sprinkle over the top to serve along with a few wild rocket leaves.  

If there were six stars to award, this recipe would have it.

I give this dish a three because it had a great taste it was too cheesy i made it a second time with 1/4 cup of just parmesan cheese which was great, i also needed more broth to cook the rice and i used chicken broth. This can be delious if you prepare it right, as i did the second time, it was a HUGE hit at a party i attened for a FOOD CRITIC. I would try this one out with a few adjustments.

This turned out much better than I expected! I didn't bother with ladling the broth into the rice. Instead, I brought the broth to a rolling boil, dumped the rice in, turned the heat down, and let it simmer for about 10 mins. I added another can of broth (chicken), little by little, until the rice was done. I can see how the mozzerella would turn it into a gluey lump, so I omitted it, and added a little more extra sharp Cheddar. This was pretty tasty. Thanks, Lara!

I added some sauteed mushrooms, cut the cheese amount down by half, and needed about another cup of broth.  Other than those changes, I thought it was a great recipe!

Although I like all of the ingredients in this recipe, the mozzarella ruins the consistency of the risotto and there is way too much parmesan.  It tastes like something I might have experimented with in college, but nothing I would ever make again.

This recipe, when you have the time to stand and stir the risotto, is absolutely delicious.  A definite crowd pleaser.  I prefered to finely chop the sun-dried tomatoes, but the use of the tomato oil is the key, it really adds the flavor.

Excellent risotto recipe.  The flavors were wonderful.  I used chicken broth instead of veg. broth and it worked fine.  Make sure you have extra broth on hand if needed.  Cutting back on the cheese is a good idea unless you want it very gooey.  I added extra tomatoes.  Risotto has a completely different texture than rice does and may seem gooey to some, especially after cheese is added, but is very delicious.

This is a little work, but my guests seem to gather in the kitchen so it's not so hard to look after.  Plus it was great, and everyone loved it!!!

I didn't really care for it - a bit bland for my taste, and I didn't like the texture that the mozzarella gave to the risotto (stringy and chewy, even though I used good fresh cheese).  on the other hand, my boyfriend adored it, so to each his own :)

Wow!  The first time I've ever made risotto because I thought it would be difficult but it was super easy and delicious.  Will be making regularly!

Pretty good, though I did cut the cheese in half.  The full amount would have been WAAAAY too much.  Also added a chopped garlic clove and used chicken stock.

Delicious! Although I used less than half the cheese the recipe called for, it was plenty cheesy for me.

This was my first risotto I ever made and was unsure what to expect.  It took a little longer then the recipe called for and a little more stock.  I used chicken stock instead of the vegetable stock.  This was possibly one of the best things I have ever eaten though!  I have told my entire family about it and promised to make it for a holiday meal some time soon!

This recipe is wonderful! I only changed a couple of things due to not having them on hand-for example, instead of vegetable stock I used chicken stock,and instead of fresh basil I had dried-and it still came out great! I also substituted dried sun dried tomatoes and added only a few diced pieces to taste. I used smoked mozzarella and parmigian reggiano cheese, again to sub for what I did not have. I also added chopped fresh garlic. This is only the second time I have made a risotto dish, and I have to say great job to the person who came up with this recipe-wonderful! I will make this again and again.

This is a great risotto recipe!  I do agree that the mozzarella is a little peculiar and I would probably not use it next time.  I used 4 c. of chicken stock and 1 1/2 c. of white wine and it was just right. As others did, I also added some garlic.  I also didn't have sun dried tomatoes but I did have a sun-dried tomato pesto sauce so I used that and it tastes wonderful.  I didn't use much salt as there is salt in that sauce.  I added grilled chopped chicken breast pieces for a perfect meal.  I would definitely make this again.  It would be a great side dish without the meat to accompany any grilled meat.

I accidently added the tomatoes in the beginning. I didn't have veggie stock, so I used chicken. Pretty good. I'd cut down on the cheeses to about 75%. I also added an extra 1/2 c. of liquid because it wasn't soft enough. Thanks!

This was my first risotto and it wasn't difficult but it did take awhile to make.  The sundried tomatoes added a nice flavor but the cheese made it too "gluey" like others have mentioned and hence the 3-star rating..sorry.

This risotto was delicious!  It came out creamy and tender after cooking for about 30 minutes.  Well worth the time, and the recipe is fairly easy. Be sure the rice doesn't stick by giving it a stir every now and then.  I found that the rice became tender more quickly if I covered the pan after ladling in the broth.  The sundried tomatoes with basil were very tasty!  Make this risotto with the Asparagus with Parmesan Crust recipe on this site-it was wonderful!

I really liked this recipe. It could have used a bit more basil and sun-dried tomatoes. The heat suggested for cooking the risotto was also a bit off.

Boyfriend approved. It wasn't out of this world but for my first shot at Risotto, pretty simple. It took MUCH longer to cook than stated and was a little annoying to babysit the rice to keep adding the stock. But using the tomato oil is awesome! I used four 14oz cans of veggie stock and I think that worked out well. Though I wish I had some extra just in case because I cook at high altitude. I used the cheese as recommended because we like things cheesy... and it was VERY cheesy. Served as a main dish with broccoli on the side.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I halved the recipe because I only made this for four people. Added mushrooms and garlic because we love them. Didn't put in any basil because the store was all out, but will definitely put it in next time. Thanks for the great recipe!

I followed the recipe almost exactly except I used dried basil instead of fresh. Also had to add water at the end because rice wasn't done after all the broth was absorbed. Tastes pretty good. Not as flavorful as I had expected it to be, but I think that's because of the water. Next time I will try using white wine or have more broth on hand

I used sundried tomato pesto, same amount, because it was already chopped. It came out really good, tasted kinda like pizza. This dish has a good potential to be kid friendly and vegetarian friendly.

I ran out of liquids at 5 cups and because I prefer my risotto especially creamy, I'll be better prepared to have at least 6 cups if not more on hand.  I suggest dicing tomatoes so you get some with every bite!  Halved mozzarella.  A nice, rich dish to accompany fish or chicken.

This was a delicious recipe.  I used the vegetable broth (cooking for a vegetarian) and it came out delicious.  I suggest sticking with the veggie broth, rather than chicken.  Also, rice cooks very slowly, I think covering it might help speed up the absorption of water.  Lastly, I agree that there is too much cheese, even though it was DELICIOUS.  I'd at least cut it in half.  Also, it was anything but bland.  If it tastes bland, then you did something wrong.

Ah, I made this a couple of weeks ago, so I can't remember exactly what my boyfriend and I thought of it. We liked it quite a bit, but I believe there ought to be less cheese. It's good, but not great. I prefer the simpler and more classic herb risotto.

This is quite possibly one of the best risotto recipes I've ever made. It's so simple and perfect. I used 3 1/4 c. chicken broth instead of veg stock, and 1 c. risotto. It came out perfect with those measurements. I served it with filet mignon (brushed the filets with the oil from the tomatoes) and buttered asparagus for my wedding anniversary. A perfectly fancy meal in the comfort of our own home! My husband LOVED it!

Good but cooking time should be doubled as well as the amount of liquid (I used the states amount of broth and then added extra water each time I added more rice).  It has a great taste but is time consuming and sits kind of heavy.  I love sun dried tomatoes so I liked it but my mom thought it was just okay.  It's also very cheesy which is why I liked it but if you're not a cheesy kind of person, I would only add half the amount.  It turned out much better the second time I made it when I added more stock and let it soak in slower.  I would make it again though.

All in all I thought the flavor was delicious.  I'm pretty sure that I followed the recipe to a "T" but somehow or another it ended up taking about 90 minutes to cook the rice!  I will try this again, as it did turn out really tasty in the end, I'll just make a couple adjustments!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was an excellent recipe. I make risotto often and made this recipe because my husband loves tomatoes. He loved it! I did reduce the vegetable stock to 4 cups and added 1 cup of white wine before the stock. I always use white wine when cooking risotto. I also used shallots instead of onion and several cloves of garlic. I agree with others that there is too much cheese, expecially mozarella. I would use 1 cup parmesan/asiago next time and 1/4-1/2 cup of mozzarella.
I do not understand why anyone would need additional liquid if they prepared the risotto properly. Also, others mentioned it took longer -- they must not have the heat turned up high enough.
The veggie stock was very tasty and I was skeptical beforehand. Definitely will make this again.

I liked it as did my boyfriend. I used half an onion and added two tablespoons of  pesto to sub for mozz cheese as I only had parm cheese on hand. It took closer to 35 minutes. Oh, and I cooked it all in one pot. I sauteed onions with olive oil in the pot and then added the risotto.
Oh, and I added a bit

Very delicious!! We will work this in when we are in the mood for risotto!  In the end I also added a fresh tomato I had left.  I did reduce the parmesan cheese.  Maybe it's not 100% traditional, but it's tasty!

As others suggested, I used 1/2 the amount of cheese and turned out better that way.  Would have prefered it without the sun-dried tomatoes.  Took 3 times as long to cook as the recipe indicated.  Would have to plan further ahead if I make again.

This was really good, though I nade a few changes.  First of all, I added about 1 cup of chardonnay to the risotto as it cooked, to add extra flavor.  My husband doesn't like sundried tomatoes so I sauteed some shitake mushrooms along with the onions and used those instead.

I'm giving it 4 stars because of the potential it has.  next time we make this, we will use white wine and chicken broth.  The veggie broth just didn't do it for us.  However.. this risotto recipes is FANTASTIC for risotto balls.

This was by far my favourite risotto I have ever made, BUT I have to agree with other reviewers that there is just too much cheese. It makes the risotto overly rich, and way too "gluey". I absolutely LOVED the flavours though, so next time I will cut the cheese in half... maybe even eliminate the mozzarella altogether. I am looking forward to eating some leftovers for lunch today!

this was fabulous - but you could easily halve the amount of cheese, either by using 1/2 c of each cheese, or just adding 1 c parmesan.

Excellent risotto.  The only suggestion I have is to put more stock in and water it down a little.  It was a  bit salty.  Although, that may have just been the one I used.  I definately suggest it!

I'm rating it a 3 because I combined 2 different recipes - that, in the end, I would rate a 5!  I combined a creamy Parmesan risotto with this one and it was excellent.  Here's the recipe:

3 - 4 cups chicken stock
1 1/2 cups white wine
1/3 cup oil packed sundried tomatoes - chopped/drained
6 tablespoons of the  oil reserved
4 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 small onion, chopped
1 large garlic clove
1 3/4 cups Arborio rice
1/2 - 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
Salt and Pepper

Heat the broth in a separate pot.  Add 2 tablespoons of butter and and 3 tablespoons oil in a dutch oven and sautee onions and garlic.  Once onions are clear, add the rice and mix to coat with the butter mixture and cook stirring often until the kernels become clear with a white spec - about 5 minutes or more (on medium heat so they don't burn).   This is key so that the kernels can absorb the liquids easily.   Add the wine, let it absorb while stirring.  I also added a small amount of salt to be absorbed by the rice.  Once wine is absorbed, begin adding the chicken stock 1/2 a cup at a time until each is absorbed, stirring almost constantly.  This takes longer than 25 minutes.  Once the rice is at the texture you like, add in the tomatoes, rest of oil and butter, and stir.  Add Parmesan cheese gradually until it's to your taste.  Salt and Pepper to taste.  Took about 45 minutes to an hour to cook but worth it.

I had some mozzarella to cut into chunks based on some other reviews but decided not to use it.

I ended up using a mix of the recipe and reviewer suggestions. Adding Chardonnay to the broth added a nice aroma and fruitiness and I switched to one cup of Asiago. We easily had 6-8 servings so next time I'll halve the entire thing so we can enjoy one day of leftovers. It did take a lot more liquid and closer to an hour and a half to cook but since I've made risotto before I wasn't surprised by this.

This risotto is really easy to make. It could do with adding more sundried tomatoes to get that nice strong flavor - I would probably use a whole cup, or close to it. Adding pine nuts makes it really nice and crunchy too. To make it a more substantial main dish, you could add chicken as well, for those meat lovers out there! I also reduced the amount of parmesan to 1/2 cup, because otherwise the cheese makes the dish way too heavy. Some tweaking of the flavors could suit your tastebuds more, but the original recipe is still really great!

I was not able to find arborio rice, but found a Morelos rice in the Hispanic aisle that looked similiar to arborio.  I did have some issues with this, but I don't think it was related to the rice.  The risotto was a little undercooked despite using about 1 and 3/4 boxes of stock,  but it was getting so late that I served it as it was. With all that cheese, I was hesitant to use sun dried tomatoes in oil, but I did use the tomatos packaged in a pouch without oil.  This recipe really made a ton, and I'm thinking we will be eating this all week.  I would definitely cut this in half unless you are serving a crowd. Good flavor.

The entire family raved about how good this was! I did find that I needed more broth than what was called for (I used about 1/2 cup extra), and I used smoked mozzarella instead of regular. This was my first attempt at risotto, and although it's time consuming, the results were well worth the time spent. I will make this again.

I pulled this recipe from Allrecipes.com 4 years ago to try my hand at making risotto for the first time.  My family loves this recipe so much that this is the only way I made risotto and we make it on a very regular basis and I never look at the recipe anymore.  I've actually found myself making extra so we have it leftover.  I keep chicken stock in the house so I use that instead of vegetable and although it's very good with mozzarella cheese, I have a fondness for making it with fontina instead.

This recipe is great as an entree, especially for a vegetarian meal! I opted to add yellow pepper for a bit of color (looks nice with the green basil and red tomatoes). If you'd like your risotto just a tad creamier, replace some of the liquid with milk! I also leave out the parmesan and strictly use mozzarella; there's a lot of flavor already. Enjoy!

I added 1/3 of the broth at a time, keeping the heat on medium-low until the broth was fully absorbed rather than adding the broth a ladleful at a time

We really enjoyed this.  I like the flavor of the sun dried tomatoes, love the idea of using the oil from the jar.  I cut the cheese back a bit and added white wine before starting the broth additions.  I make a lot of risotto and didn't have any trouble cooking this-it cooked the same as any risotto, took about 25 minutes once I started adding the broth.  The only thing I will say is that with the cheese and tomato oil it is quite rich, so be prepared!  Very yummy and I'll definitely make it again!

It took much longer than 25 minutes to cook away the broth (I think it was closer to 45-50 minutes) and I thought it was bland.  Adding seasoned salt and garlic helped.  I'm not sure if I'd make it again.

We did not care for this.  I think it may have been the vegetable broth.  Maybe the natural flavor of the rice.

I made this recipe from the William Sonoma cookbook and found that increasing both the broth amount and the heat on the rice helped it to cook faster.

I have made this twice and both times I ended up adding more liquid than it called for because it took forever for the rice to cook.  I added some white cooking wine along with the vegetable stock for added flavor, and we cut back on the mozzarella as others suggested.  Both times, my family got too hungry waiting so we didn't cook the rice until tender because it took at least 40 minutes and counting.  We liked the flavor, just not really patient enough to wait for the rice to cook.  Maybe one day when I have nothing better to do we'll make this again.  Not a good recipe for a busy family.

I scaled this down all the way to make enough for just one person. Maybe because of this, the rice wasn't soft enough near the end. Not a problem, I just added in more liquid, and it turned out just perfect. :)

Didn't measure out the cheeses, but I know how much I like, hehe. I didn't have a problem with the texture, unlike some other reviewers, but again... I like cheese. :) All in all, I loved the recipe, and will definitely make it again! (Forgot to mention... this was the first time I've ever made risotto too!)

If the mozzarella was left out, I would have given 5 stars.  Didn't care for the consistency.  Parmasean alone, it would have been great.  Added garlic powder and fresh parsley.(didn't have basil) Will make again with changes noted.

The taste is very good; a great side dish to Baby back ribs done on the BBQ.  The only negative would be that during the 25 minutes you are stirring in the vegie stock, it is very labor intensive for the one who stirs. Still a small price to pay for an excellent dish.

I added some fresh garlic and used chicken broth instead of vegatable, as well as adding a half cup of white wine to the dish (before the broth). I also used a few more sundried tomatoes - because both myself and husband really enjoy them. I used both Mozzeralla as well as Asiago Cheese (but only 3/4 of what was called for in the receipe - next time I will use even less). It turned out really well and would definitely make it again.

A good weekday recipe that is reasonably quick. I used garlic chives instead of basil with good effect. My toddler [15 months] really liked this recipe as it is gluggy enough to stick to her spoon. Hence the dog didn't like it as much as there was much less ending up on the floor.

Very filling...not necessarily in a good way.  The sweetness of the tomatoes contrasted poorly with the saltiness of the rice and vegetable stock.
