Delicious!  Next time I think I will try only using 1 and a 1/2 or 2 onions and maybe add one more can of tomato.  All-in-all...a wonderful recipe!  Glad to finally find something to make with all the lemon balm from my garden.

Good use of lemon balm. Definitely cut back on onions, 1 is plenty. Saute onions before combining with tomatoes. Shitake's were lost. Try button mushrooms, maybe add zucchini. Color is unattractive, but taste is excellent.

I really enjoyed this. Used the recipe more as a guide. Used whole wheat pasta, chopped 4 fresh tomatoes and just tossed in uncooked. Added black olives, portobello  mushrooms. Left out the onion and added capers. Tossed with lots of fresh herbs-oregano and some sweet basil.

This was awesome! Such a great use of our lemon mint.  We used this as a base.  We sauteed broccoli, red onion, a can of diced tomatoes, chopped up some chicken and added probably twice as much of the lemon basil pesto.  We wanted a strong pesto taste.  When I did it separately though, I was nicely surprised of how much it tasted like basil pesto.  Very good! Thank you for sharing.

I've had lemon balm propagating like CRAZY in my yard for years!  This is so good, I may need more lemon balm.
