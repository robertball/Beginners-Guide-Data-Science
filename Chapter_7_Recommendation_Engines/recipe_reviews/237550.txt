I love asparagus and thought the addition of goat cheese would be the perfect complement to the asparagus.   The asparagus perfectly cooked crisp tender and had a lot of flavor.   I used plain goat cheese because that is what I had in the fridge, but, I think the herb variety would be even better.   I will make again, but, I think next time I will add the goat cheese just the last few minutes instead of cooking the entire time.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was good, a nice change from always just steaming my fresh asparagus. Like had been suggested, I added the cheese when there were only a few minutes of cooking time left. I wish I'd used less salt as the goat cheese was super salty! It's a nice, simple recipe that tastes great, glad I found it.

This turned out SOOO yummy. I love goat cheese and asparagus but never thought to combine the two. Excellent with my favorite maple glazed salmon dish ????
