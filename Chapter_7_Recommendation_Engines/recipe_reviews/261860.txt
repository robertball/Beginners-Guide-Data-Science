5.10.20  I had a box of white cake mix that was nearing its “best by” date, so this was the perfect recipe to use it up.  The cake mix was 16 oz, so I added a little cake flour to get it up to 18.25 oz.  I’m quite happy with the way this turned out. Served today with a dollop of whipped cream and a sprig of fresh mint. Super simple to make, a firm crust that cut well into bars/squares, had nice eye appeal, and tasted good!  The best way to describe its texture is fudgy/chocolaty.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, we enjoyed it
