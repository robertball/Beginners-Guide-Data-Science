I think either the people below can't cook, or don't know how to follow directions.  It takes too long?  Come on!  My five year old helped me do this and we were STILL successful.  Cutting the cheese takes like 5 minutes, dipping in egg and cracker crumbs takes .. what.. 3 minutes?  Putting the nice little squares in the freezer for 10 minutes.. then frying about 8 minutes on each side.  WOW!  That was hard?  The clean up... you dump the cracker crumbs.. put the eggs down the sink - then dispose the grease.  It made a mess?  Obviously these people are NOT cut out for cooking.  Ya think??  Try these!  They are irresistible!  FAST and EASY.  My two year old and five year old loved them.  Y-u-m-m-y!

These taste great.  I have used both cheddar and mozzerella cheese to make.  I don't do often though, because it makes a mess and is a lot of work.  Easier to order them when we go out to dinner.  For mess alone I marked down to a three.

These turned out really greesy for me.  I don't know if I did it right but even after draining them on paper towels they were still really oily and greesy.  Also, sometimes the cheese would leak through during cooking and it made it really messy.  I think this would be something children would enjoy though.

Not very easy, but tasty enough to make them every once in a while.  Before tasting, I vowed never to make these again, but one bite convinced me otherwise.

These were okay, but they all got stuck together during frying.  I suggest frying them in very small batches.

I refrigerated my pieces, if there is a next time I make these, I'll freeze them instead. They were way too greasy compared to restaurant versions or the ones you buy at the store.  We ended up throwing them away, just too greasy for us and the breading needed kick..maybe use italian bread crumbs instead.

Recipe was ok.  It wasn't very timely but when I was frying they got all melted and melted together (like another person said, maybe do small batches a time, but mine were small and not filling the pan to begin with).  It was VERY greasy even after draining them. The taste was superb, but not worth it.

Great! I used Londoner aged White Cheddar. Be sure to watch these closely, one minute too long will give you a messy cheese blob.
