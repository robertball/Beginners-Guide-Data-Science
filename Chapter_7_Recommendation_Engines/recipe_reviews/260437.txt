Followed as is except substituted cherry tomatoes because I did not have sun dried on hand. I will try that next time. Suspect it would also be great substituting quinoa for rice.  It was fantastic. Thanks!

delicious! I only added about twice the amount of rice while not changing the amount of the other ingredients. The relations were a lot better that way :)

I did not have chickpeas, cukes, parsley, or tomatoes and it still made a very tasty salad!!
