There was also way too much liquid in it, it almost ended up like soup. I completely wasted some expensive ingredients all because of a poor recipe. If we were permitted to give a negative rating I would!

I add a cup of wine and some sauteed mushrooms.. I also substituted a Brick of cream cheese for the condensed milk. I cut back half of the chicken broth and mushroom . Soup.. I b r o w n e d the chicken and then combine all the ingredients to a boil. then I combine the chicken with all the ingredients into a casserole dish and bake it for 30 minutes head next time I'll cut back on the tarragon.

This works well if you cut the chicken broth to 1/2 cup.  I personally used pappardelle pasta, which is an  extra wide noodle.  This dish is on the tangy side, which I love, yet not too sour as the condensed milk helps cut through that.

This was amazing! As long as you remember to drain the ingredients it comes out creamy, not too thick or runny! We also added some spinach and smoked Spanish paprika! Mmm!  Even my toddler loved this! It's going to be our new go-to!
