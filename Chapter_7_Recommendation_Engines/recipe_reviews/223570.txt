Doesn't get much easier than this!  Very tasty and healthy.  I used jarred salsa and cut the amount to about 12 oz.  I also added fresh cilantro.  It tasted a tad salty, but that could be remedied by using the fresh salsa. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

It is really good. I forgot about the cumin recommendation, but thought it was really good even so. Probably depends on the type of salsa you use. I will make this a lot--and probably add chicken periodically.

REALLY good, healthy and filling. I did use chicken broth (low sodium/fat free) instead of water and red quinoa. Instead of fresh corn I used a can of sweet kernel corn. I made some fresh salsa with tomatoes, serrano peppers, red onion, cilantro and lime juice. We really enjoyed it.

Super easy recipe. I like that there aren't a lot of ingredients. I added a little cumin, as one reviewer suggested. I only had frozen corn and used one cup, adding that to the quinoa when it was about done. I'll probably heat up the black beans next time so that it remains hot - by the time I added in cold salsa and avocado, it was luke warm.

Very healthy but a bit bland. Cumin with the quinoa helps bring out the flavor.
