I did not have banana liqueur. What I did instead was use a frozen banana instead and blended all the ingredients together in my blender which made it smoothie-like. Quite good!

Yum! Taste very light and refreshing. Doesn't taste like an alcohol drink so be careful and don't gobble it down too fast.:)

Wow...you can't tell that this drink has any alcohol in it. Be very careful when drinking this you'll keep on drinking it and end up buzzed!
