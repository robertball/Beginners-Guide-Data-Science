This is quick and simple to throw together. I intended to use it as a topping for a cheesecake, but it got cloudy upon cooling. I ended up changing my plan as a result. I’ll be making some mini pies to use up the filling.

Very simple to make and quite delicious.  I used the filling for blueberry turnovers using puff pastry dough I had in the freezer.  The blueberries I used were sweet to begin with so I could have reduced the sugar even further.

This was perfect!  I only had frozen blueberries so I had to adjust the other ingredients some.  The cinnamon really did the trick, but like someone else said it was a little bland.  Blueberries can be that way.  I didn't want to use any lemon so I added about a half teaspoon of salt and that woke it up.  My pie was great!

This was very good, but (made into a yogurt parfait like I did). It is very low in sugar and even with sweet blueberries is tasty, healthy, but honestly not sweet enough for a pie. Try it as a parfait, on frozen yogurt, on a dessert, and it will be excellent. I made it just for the fact that it had so little sugar compared to similar recipes. I was tempted to add additional water, but do not do that. The blueberries will cook down and make their own. I think fresh is a must with this recipes, so as to make the cornstarch work effectively without the excess water. I bought a large pack of blueberries at Sam's Club. I measured the package and it was 3 1/2 cups. So, I just made 1/4 of the recipe, which made enough for 2 large or 3 small parfaits or a blueberry sauce on other foods. 1/4 of the recipe still took 2 cups of blueberries. The full recipe takes 8. I layered it in a glass with Trader Joes Vanilla Bean yogurt and topped it off with a little lite whipped topping I sprayed on top. I thought it was as good, or better, in this combination, as any blueberry cheesecake I have had. Very creamy. TY

I used this on a homemade cheesecake, was lovely together! So yummy! I added about 2 squirts of lemon juice in the blueberry filling, added nice a zing. Totally making this again!

It was the type of recipe I was looking for....just the filling. I did add some lemon juice and followed the rest of the directions for 4 servings, adding just a few more fresh blueberries at the end. It is a nice, not too sweet recipe. Thanks!

I didn't make any changes.  The recipe I always follow the first time I use it.  The pie filling was sweet enough for my household and family.  I got many complements on it.  I made Blueberry Angel Dessert.  Everyone was impressed, especially the  birthday girl.

EXCELLENT!!  Easy to make and tastes extra yummy.  I added a pinch more cornstarch and almost 1/4 cup more water.  Will use it on top of a slice of angel food cake.

This IS easy and quick. I only had frozen blueberries, which seemed to work fine. The flavor is a little bland to me; I wonder if it is because I had to adjust serving size down pretty drastically due to number of berries on hand. After scrutinizing the flavor, I added a dash of vanilla but that didn't help. This may be one of those recipes where the flavor gets better as you let it cool and sit in fridge a day or two, like lasagna does!

I bought a blueberry pie from the grocery store and the blueberry filling was dry and porous.  it was weird, I dont know how that can happen.   but had frozen blueberries so I made this and replaced the filling.   I hate making crust. 
It was pretty good.

This was super easy, and very tasty.  I used blueberries that I had picked myself the day before.  I also made this into a blueberry/lavender pie.  It was a BIG hit!  For the water required for the pie filling, I put fresh lavender buds in my loose leaf tea strainer, boiled the water, then let the lavender steep in it.  I also took 2 tablespoons of fresh lavender buds and crushed them with small bowl and back end of a butter knife (my mortar and pestal are not with me so I had to make do).  When the filling was just starting to thicken, I added the crushed puds to the mixture.  when the filling was ready and cooled, I put it in the crust and refrigerated the whole thing over night.  Just before serving I scooped Cool Whip around the edges and decorated with blueberries, then added one dollop and one blueberry to the middle.  Everyone loved it!

I substituted 1/4 cup natural unsweetened applesauce for the sugar and water and the filling turned out great for my blueberry cream pie! It helps if the blueberries are in season and are already sweet on their own. The recipe doesn't really specify, but you need to mash the 3 pints of blueberries a little as you stir.

This was a disappointment .  It is not sweet enough even with using 1/2 cup of sugar rather than the 1/4 cup in the recipe.  Even my hubby who does not like a sweet filling didn't like this.

Wow! So easy. I used Splenda plus 1 tsp sugar. Very good. I used in  a recipe for low carb blueberry cream pie. Cream 8 oz light cream cheese and 8 oz FF sour cream, add 2 sugar free vanilla pudding packs, 2 c milk, and about 2 c of this recipe's blueberry pie filling. So good!!

I made a half batch to fill the middle of a tangy lemon and blueberry layer cake - perfect!! I did add 1 tbsp lemon juice at the end to add some zest to go along with the cake.

I have made this recipe several times and it's always amazing! I fill crepes and top them with sour cream. It's simple and so delicious!
