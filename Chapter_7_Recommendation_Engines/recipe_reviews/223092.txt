As the creator of this recipe, I want to say thanks for all the positive reviews!  Second, I want to add that Allrecipes did not publish this recipe exactly as I submitted it (these were supposed to be "Raeben" burgers named after my daughter whose middle name is Rae).  Anyway, always add salt to a burger to bring out the flavor.  If any dish seems like its "missing something" it's likely salt!  The most important omission was on the dressing where I said, "plus more for dipping".  As some have noted, they are a little bland without the Thousand Island as a dipping sauce (or spread it on your bread/bun).  Thanks for the reviewer who tried it without bread.  Our family is now gluten-free and it's so much cheaper and healthier to just ditch the GF bun :-(  I'm going to try them next week with swiss cheese as others have noted....at the time I just used what was in the fridge.

I stumbled on this by accident and I am glad I did. I made this exactly as directed and everyone loved them. The 1000 island dressing in the ground turkey made the patties so moist and delicious. It was quick and easy also. This will be a family favorite.

OMG where have you been all my life, Reuben Turkey Burgers??!! My only changes were to speed it up and simplify even more, so I just toasted the bread and dolloped additional Thousand Island on the slices. Also, while the burgers were cooking, I sauteed the onions in a separate frying pan, so everything was hot and ready all at the same time. Oh, and for more authentic Reuben, I used Swiss.

The idea is right, but it needs a bit of work to be a 5 star recipe.  As a complete sandwich, the flavor is pretty good, but the meat by itself is so bland.  I did not taste a bit of dressing, and the bread crumbs made the consistency very strange.  If I did this again, I would omit the Italian breadcrumbs completely, but maybe add some Italian seasonings and a bit of salt to give the meat some flavor.  Adding additional dressing onto the top of the sandwich would be much more flavorful as well because I didn't taste any of it in the meat.  However, even though it was bland, the grilled onions, sauerkraut, and rye bread were flavorful enough to make up for it.  Also, I think Swiss cheese is a better fit, since this is supposed to mimic the Reuben.  Overall, it was an OK recipe, but I think with some work, this could turn into a really yummy sandwich!

This was very good - the only change I would make is to cook the sauerkraut.

I messed up and added my oil to the meat as it was already sitting there. It did not hurt it in any way. I also added 3 eggs to it as a few other recipes used eggs in theres. More onions but chopped were also added to the meat.  This was very moist and will be saved. We get a LOT of ground turkey from a store called Woodmens that is in southern Wisconsin as they end up with a lot in there (end of selling time bin) Its only a little over a buck a pound when in there.  PS  Swiss cheese added more taste.

Very good! The burger was moist, very mild but liked it with the toppings. We ate without the bread and was still exceptional. Used swiss instead of Mozz as personal preference.

Quick recipe to get together and very tasty!   The burgers themselves didn't have a strong flavor profile, but, they were very moist and worked very well with the sauerkraut.  The only thing I did different was to add a little thousand island dressing to the bun so it wasn't dry and used whole wheat buns instead of whole grain bread.  I would make again, but, would probably add some additional seasonings to the turkey.

Burgers were full of flavor. Used Swiss cheese in place of mozzarella and did heat up the kraut. Hubby really liked these.

This wash nice change of pace for something a little different.  My family thought the turkey was a little bland, so we're going to try ground beef next time.

These burgers are great and my boyfriend loved them !! Will definitely make them again ! My only adjustments were I made 4.5 oz burgers used skim cheese, and butter spread for the rolls.
