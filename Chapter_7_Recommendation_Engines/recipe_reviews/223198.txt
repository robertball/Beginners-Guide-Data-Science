I would cut the vinegar to 1/4 cup next time, it was just a little too much for me. I added four pinches of fresh rosemary which just complimented beautifully.

This is a keeper. I served it with grilled chicken wings, and it was a hit! I was skeptical after reading the reviews because I had already mixed the ingredients, and it was quite vinegary...but after allowing it to meld for 24 hours. It was perfect. I will continue to follow the recipe as written.

Easily customizable, I switched the pickle for pickled turnips and got to use my fresh garden greens. Thank you for sharing!

I made this two ways. First, I made a homemade mayo with horseradish and mustard, and added this to the salad. The second time, I used sour cream instead of mayo. Also, I left out the cornichons in both versions. I think next time I might add a few chopped green olives, and also some finely chopped spring onions. That said, both versions were delicious. Chef John, I have to say you really have some great food ideas. The mustard greens added the right zing to the salad. Loved it!

I would cut the vinegar as another reviewer mentioned. Not sure by how much though. I had to add some honey and sour cream to lessen the acidity. BUT I don't measure when I cook. I just add stuff so it's possible that I  added too much vinegar in the first place.

I can't find mustard greens so I add texture with chopped kale and compensate with dijon mustard. Wish I could taste it as Chef John makes it!!

Still one of the best potato salads I've ever had and get rave reviews every time I make it.
