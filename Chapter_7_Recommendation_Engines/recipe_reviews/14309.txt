I really wish I would have checked the reviews before making this one.  It tasted too vinegary and we ended up having to throw the whole thing out.  Yuck.

Hmm...maybe it was me and my anchovies, but this was overwhelmingly salty and not thoroughly enjoyable.

Quick to prepare and very tasty. The dressing has a very appetizing flavor also.

I made this last night and cut the recipe for 2. The only change I made was to poach an egg and add to other ingredients. It was delicious! Thanks Jessica.

I make homemade Caesars at least twice a week and eat it whenever I go out. When I saw this recipe, I figured I would give it a shot. I didn't have the vinegar but tried the ground mustard and egg sub. Everything else is how I usually make it except I add 2 tsp of worcestercire (there are 2 listings for lemon juice in this recipe and I am wondering if one of them is for that....). The ground mustard (not the same as jarred mustard, taste it!) flavor gave it a kick that wasn't bad. The only problem I had was that I usually poach an egg for 45 seconds in boiling water rather than using the egg sub. The poached egg yolk, even over a regular uncooked egg yolk, gives a creamy consistency I couldn't get with the substitute. I whisked for several minutes (usually the longer you whisk, the creamier it gets) and could not get the consistency I wanted. Also, an entire 2oz can of anchovies is a crazy amount. If you really want to use all that, rinse it first or it will be terribly salty. Typically I use a tsp of anchovy paste, which blends better, then a few finely chopped anchovies mixed in with a couple more layered on top if people want them. Anyway, skip the egg sub and just use the single POACHED egg yolk. It makes a whole different dressing and flavor. Then add more of the various ingredients to taste. BTW don't forget the homemade garlic croutons! (See photo). A really good Caesar is well worth learning to make. I learned a lot here. Thanks for posting!

This is a really good recipe.  I think you could coddle the egg if you don't have egg substitute.  Also, I use a little less anchovy because they can be really salty but delicious.
