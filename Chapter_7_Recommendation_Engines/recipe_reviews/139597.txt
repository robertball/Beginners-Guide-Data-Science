Wow, delicious! I ommitted the sugar as the spice with the sweetness of the fresh apple cider were sweet enough for me.

Forgot to add that I make this in my percolator serving urn and put everything but the cider in basket and let it perk! It keeps it hot and the only thing I need to do is reload when it runs out.

I really enjoyed this recipe for Thanksgiving. I used folded coffee filters instead of cheese cloth and tied the end off then just left it in a crock pot covered on high. Everyone loved it, and I had 3 cups. I'll make it again for Christmas. Thanks!

Very tasty and so easy. I would lower the sugar  next time just for personal taste. Thanks for sharing Home Cooks.

I made this last year for Christmas Eve and it was a hit.  I am making it for Thanksgiving this year.  I will have it ready when everyone comes home from the high school football game.

I just love this recipe! I used ground Allspice since I didn't have any whole on hand and it still is great! I'll be making this for our Thanksgiving and Christmas parties! Thanks!

This was very good. I used Motts tots low sugar apple juice. It was a little sweet for my taste, even though I cut 1 T. sugar out of the original recipe.

I tried this recipe and my family and fianc√© loved it! In addition to the ingredients I added 4 bayleafs, a handful of pepper corns and 1/4 cup of captain Morgan spiced rum and allowed it to simmer on the stove for an hour. Once it was done I poured it through a cheese cloth to purify the drink and the house had a wonderful smell. I will most certainly make this recipe again!!!

This is my go-to fall drink when entertaining or craving something warm and comforting. This recipe gets rave reviews and now is requested by friends! I add all ingredients to my teapot (with as much of the cider as I can) and only use 1 TBSP regular brown sugar as I think that gives just enough sweetness. Then I heat until boiling (or until my teapot whistles) and then serve. Make it "adult" with an add-your-own shot of spiced rum or enjoy on it's own. Keep adding cider to the teapot reusing the same spices and adding another 1 TBSP brown sugar as needed.  If you have leftover spiced cider, place it in a container in the fridge and heat a mug at a time in the future!

I omitted the sugar as well not needed. May increase spice just a little next time. Warm and tasty.
