KEEPER! This was so GOOD!!!! The only thing I did different was use "blackening" seasoning on the fish. My hubby about fell out of the chair when he tried this. I lost patience trying to peel the cabbage leaves, I only got about 6 of them and gave up! So I diced up the cabbage and mixed it with the wasabi mayo and served it kinda like a coleslaw. So good!! Thank you thank you! :D

These were good especially since I wrapped the whole thing in a warm flour tortilla after I snapped the photo!! Personally, I cant eat fish tacos w/o cabbage so these were just Right for me! I only had chipotle hot sauce so I made a taco sauce with mayo and a little sugar. YumO!! Thank You Rachel!
