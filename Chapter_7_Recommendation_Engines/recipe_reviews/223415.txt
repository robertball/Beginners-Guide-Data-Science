We enjoyed this!  It was nice to have a variation of this dessert that isn't all chocolate.  I will make this again for the kids.

I've made this recipe several times over the years. But last night, I doubled the recipe for a work function and was confident that there would be a little left over to bring home (because the dish was HUGE). I thought wrong! These people scraped the bottom of the pan and there was NOTHING left! They absolutely loved it!!!! I'm not sure I've ever had so many compliments over a recipe!!!! 

As it turns out, our local grocery store actually had French vanilla pudding in stock, which is rare, so I made it with the French vanilla pudding this time. But I've made it with regular vanilla pudding in the past and it has been just as good. Enjoy!!!!!

Just made it with a few additions. Added 1 cup of coconut, and used 1 bag of Chocolate filed Oreos for the base, and 1/2 bag of the double stuffed Oreos for the top. Also blended up some pecans into the mix of cream cheese/butter/sugar. And finally topped it off with chocolate fudge and caramel fudge on top., drizzled across the grand finale. My family enjoys it so much more than the regular recipe, and well worth it. OUTSTANDING DESSERT!

This is my go-to dirt recipe. The only change I make is not to layer but mix 2/3 of the crushed cookie into the mix instead of layering. Also want to make Sand?? Use golden Oreos or mills wafers!! Great alternative!!

This came out really good. It yields so much! I used a food processor to combine the butter, cream cheese and sugar.  It came out nice and smooth.  I also crushed the Oreos in the food processor and I think I crushed them too much because the end result is too smooth!  But it was very good and I would make this again, I just world my mix it so much!

I called mine "Compost Pile." I added some shredded coconut (lightly dusted w/coco powder) and some pulverized "piles" of graham cracker crumbs. Perfect for Earth Day!

Made this for a family event and put gummy worms on top, and everyone choose it over DQ ice cream cake... now that's insanely delicious! I'm pretty sure it's the cream cheese and the FRENCH vanilla pudding not just vanilla pudding; I've seen other recipes without these details not nearly taste as good as this one.

I use chocolate pudding and omit the confectioner's sugar(it is still  sweet  without the added sugar). My grandson's favorite, especially with sour gummy worms!

Haven't tasted it yet but the Bowl Licking commenced immediately and the flavor was amazing. Everything came out like the instructions said and it was SUPER EASY to make. Less than 45 mins. SO I give it 5 stars just for the ease of making it.

My Aunt has been making this forever and it is just to die for! We loved it so much that it is not only requested, but my mom immediately asked for the recipe. Now dirt pudding is a tradition every Halloween that we do! It is just so good! I addded a pinch of salt to balance out the sweetness of the pudding, and 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla because who doesn’t love vanilla?!? I then layered the pudding in small cups over orange Halloween Oreos. Everyone loved it!!I will make this recipe again and again!!??

Changed out vanilla pudding for chocolate and followed the rest of the recipe as is. Tasted great! I only wished I had doubled the recipe so that we had leftovers. It is rich so you don't need huge servings but I fed a party of 12 pre teen boys and had just a few servings left for parents.

I  followed the recipe.  Not sure if i loved the French Vanilla Pudding .  It had a funny after taste.  The dirt  was still very good, but I would try another flavor next time.  Our company  really liked it.

This recipe is delicious and a huge hit for summer picnics. I doubled the recipe and substituted chocolate pudding for vanilla. I also layered the crushed cookies and served the pudding in a large punch bowl.

I hadn't made "DIRT" in years! Just as yummy as I remembered - maybe more so! Our company loved it also.

Delicious, easy, and kids inhaled it (so did some adults).  Just be sure the cream cheese is really softened, or else you have lumps.

I made this as a surprise for my roommate for when she got back from visiting her family because I know she had it one other time before and liked it. She comes back tonignt and I have to wait to touch until she comes home, the wait is killing me it's just that tasty.

I've loved this recipe for years. I decided to try it with Lemon Oreos
and 1 box of vanilla pudding and 1 box of lemon pudding making sure it wouldn't be too tart. I took it to work and everybody just couldn't get enough of it. I came home with an empty dish. This is now my favorite flavor of dirt pudding. I also tried it with chocolate pudding and Chocolate Oreos. It was great that way as well.

My kids ask for this every time! I've been told this is the only thing I should ever bring to a cook out! Of course, I tweak the recipe just a little. I drizzle a little hardening shell over the top layer of cookies!

This is the best dirt pudding I've ever tasted. It's best to let it sit overnight in the frig too. I shared it with the teachers at school and they all wanted the recipe.
