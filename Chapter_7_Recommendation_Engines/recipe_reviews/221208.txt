I had to change this up a bit - but used all the same ingredients.  I started this stove top - melted the butter and sauteed the onions, a clove of garlic a diced carrot and a 2 stalks of celery (not called for in the recipe)  added the flour and made a roux.  I stirred and cooked that down, added chicken broth, instead of water and the chicken soup base.  Added the corn, parsley, dill and celery seed and chicken soup.  Then added the potatoes - brought to a simmer and then added it all to the slow cooker set on low.   I would suggest dicing the potatoes fairly small and I think I would omit the chicken soup next time and use use some milk when I made the roux.  This is rather salty with the ham, canned soup etc...  be careful adding any extra salt.  Overall we were very pleased with this soup, I would really just suggest changing the method.

Made this last night and everyone loved it.  I did have to change a few things.  I was out of Cream of Chicken but had Cream of Potato also didnt use corn and didn't add any extra salt most of the ingredients had enough of there own.  Just had the leftovers for lunch and it was even better.

Very good flavor and the right ingredients.  No need to add salt as the ham has plenty.  I would have liked the base to be thicker so next time I may take the top off the pot for the last hour or so.  Served with toasted cheese sandwispches, my husband loved it and didn't detect it was a light recipe.

When I see a recipe that has corn in it or any particular vegetable that my husband would not like to see floating in his soup, all I do is puree the vegetable and add it to the rest of the soup.  You can't see it in the soup and you still get the wonderful flavor without messing up the original recipe. - MI

I absolutely loved this! I really get tired of leftover ham. Ham is too salty for me to want day after day so I'm always looking for leftover ham recipes. This one hit the spot. My 3 year old ate it too so you know it's good. Thank you!

This is a good recipe. I cut the potatoes quite small because I wanted to be sure that they were cooked really well. I cooked the soup for the full amount of time and the potatoes were definitely not overcooked. Next time I would cook it just a little bit longer. The addition of dill was excellent (we are fans of dill). This will go into my rotation.

A secret that I use to thicken my potato soup...use instant mashed potatoes. Adds flavor & thickens better than flour!

This was good but the seasoning was not my new favorite. I would make this again without the dill and celery seed, adding diced celery and maybe a different herb. I used healthy request cream of chicken soup and broth instead of the water/base combo. With those changes, I did not find this to be too salty. I cooked 6 hours on low and the white potatoes were just tender but not breaking down at all even though I cut them into 1/2 inch rather than 1 inch cubes.

It was delicious. I have to eat low potassium and low or no sodium foods. I leached the potatoes, made my own cream of chicken from another recipe. I used frozen vegetables and added no salt, still goooooooood!!!

For a creamier soup add instant mashed potatoes towards the end of cooking. For more flavor start with  crushed  bacon and dripping instead of butter. Frozen hash brown potatoes can be substituted for a faster cooking soup.

I made this today for the first time and it was really simple to make. Normally, I am patient and let things cook in the crockpot and try not to lift the lid. However, today I tasted it and did so another 3 or so times. It was fantastic! The only thing I did differently was to add slices of Kielbasa. Next time I might use a litle less butter. 5 stars

I made this recipe as is with one small change....I added a small can of corn (8oz) with juice.  The soup was a bit thinner than I would have liked so I added about a half cup of instant potato flakes the last hour of cooking to thicken it a bit.  Loved it.  Will definitey make again!  Thank you for sharing.

I love to make crock pot soups and this one is a keeper and a nice change from my usual potato soup. I used chicken broth instead of water and bullion and added carrots. I also added 2 cans of cream of chicken soup.

I like to make a recipe the first time according to the recipe. I should have followed my instincts when making this the first time and I think it would have been much better for us.  Next time: no extra butter, no extra salt, no dill, use fresh celery not celery seed, and reduce the parsley at least by half.  I like the idea of adding some instant potatoes to thicken and will probably do that when I reheat.

Need to try this again with chicken or turkey, carrots instead of corn and added thickener.  A creamy soup would have been better.  Potatoes didn't cook without extra cooking.  Broth tasted very good.

This was a great recipe.  My family loved it.  
I used low sodium chicken broth and salt free butter.  I added celery and carrots.  It turned out wonderful. I cooked it for 6 hours on high and my veggies turned out perfect.   Thanks for the recipe and tips.

Followed some of the revisions from other reviewers: used low-salt chicken broth in place of water/soup base; used celery instead of celery seed; sauteed the onion, celery, some chopped carrots & 3 cloves of garlic before adding; used 1 sweet potato (pre-cooked in microwave for 3 mins)with other regular potatoes, and cut all potatoes into 1/2 inch cubes; mixed flour with skim milk instead of water, and added fresh parsley at the end. Perfect for a post-basketball game meal with some rustic bread!

This soup is fantastic!  Made two changes - used boxed chicken broth and left out the celery seed (I was out of it).  Also used little red new potatoes, left the skins on.  Did not add any salt, the ham provided all the salt needed.  Recipe is definitely a keeper!

I made this for dinner and we really liked it. I just used chicken broth instead of water and added a can of evaporated milk for a creamier base. I also added mushrooms and left out the corn.  I didntnhave any dill but i added some dried chives and a splash of red cooking wineI used an immersion blender and blended it just a bit to thicken it and hide some of the mushrooms from the kids. It was easy to make and turned out better than I expected.

This is definitely one of the easiest recipes I ever made and takes about 5 minutes to prep. It is a perfect week night meal. If you are looking for quick, easy, and something warm this is the recipe for you! If you are trying out for America's Next Top Chef and you are trying to increase your culinary repertoire then I would try your hand at something else.

This soup had a mix of strange flavors. Something about the dill weed and celery seed did not mix well. I guess I was expecting something totally different. I did not like it at all but my husband said it was "ok" A recipe I will delete from my box for sure! Sorry

Very tasty recipe.  I would leave dill out next time. and  not add  salt.Low sodium Soup might taste better. I added cut canned green beans as it was alittle thin.  Would make it again.

This chowder is very tasty. I omitted the dill (not a fan) and the celery seed. I used about a cup of chopped celery and about a cup of mashed potatoes (to thicken it instead of the canned soup). I added the mashed potatoes last and let it simmer for about a half hour after I added them. A new family favorite!

Very good. I didn't have chicken soup base or cream of chicken soup, so I used cream of mushroom soup and added salt and seasoning salt. Used 3 potatoes and that was plenty, and skipped the parsley, dill weed, and celery seed. Very tasty and satisfying on a cold night like tonight. Was left wishing I had made some cornbread or something to go with it.  Roomie was scraping the bowl :)

I made this on a rainy Sunday morning because I had all the ingredients on hand and it looked very good. I added a carrot and next time I would add celery and cut down on the parsley. Very good soup to use up all that extra ham with. We liked it!

Good basic recipe. I sauteed the onion first and made a white sauce with the butter, flour, 3 cups water and 1 cup milk. I omitted the cream soup. I added 1/2 cup instant potatoes per suggestion and it turned out creamy and delicious. Family loved it.

I've made 2x's. 1st time as recipes calls for, second time according to my taste. Original recipe is way too salty with soup base, canned soup and ham. Also kind of thin for a chowder. I liked the volume of chowder the recipe made, so I used 3C low sodium chicken broth and a healthy version of the cream of chicken soup. I used 2C of ham instead. I followed directions other than changing those ingredients. When potatoes were done, I whisked in 1-2 cups cooked mashed potatoes(I used boxed) to thicken to a heavier consistency and give some more texture. I let the chowder cook down some after adding the potatoes. It came out great, smooth, creamy, filling. Topped with bacon crumbles and cheese. Very, very good, really simple and a great way to use up leftovers.

Made quite a few changes.  Used bacon rather than ham.

Sauteed the onion in two strips of bacon for about 20 minutes.  Added two chopped carrots and two chopped celery sticks.

Used 5 potatoes.  Only 1/2 cup of corn.  1/8 cup flour.

About 3 drops of hot sauce.

Cooked on high for 5.5 hours.

The rest of the recipe was the same.

This was a tasty chowder, the changes that I made were, I used a large can 26 oz cream of chicken, I substituted the 1/2 cup of water with milk, I added fresh mushrooms, and about 4 oz of processed American cheese. I also added red pepper flakes cause I like spice. One thing I kept out was the dill, the first time my family thought it was way to dilly.

I put 2 celery stalks, diced.  1/4 tsp dill instead of 1 tsp.  I didn't have cream of chicken soup, so put in a can of cream of celery.  It was excellent.  Will certainly make this again, and will put in cream of chicken soup to see which one I prefer.

Subbed sodium reduced chicken broth for water (did not use the chicken soup base), was leery about the dill weed, but I was wrong, it was delicious and added a nice twist to the chowder.

I tried this receipe yesterday.  Followed the exact directions but added a few carrots and a touch extra water.  Surprisingly found the soup anc especially broth very good!  I think the cream of chicken soup added a lot to the flavour.  Will certainly make again!

I skipped the dill and celery spices due to picky kids and the flavor was still good. The family complained that the soup was watery, which they did not like. I think if I made this again I would add less water and maybe more flour to thicken it up.

I did not add any salt and it was way too salty.  I used fresh dill which was better.  It was okay just nothing to write home about.

Made this with leftover ham from the holidays.  Bursting with flavor, dill adds a special twist to it.  Did not add the corn, my husband is not a fan of adding veggies to soups other than vegetable.  Will definitely make again!
