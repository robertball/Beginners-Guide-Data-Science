This was AMAZING! My whole family keeps asking for it again! We used mushrooms instead of eggplant, just because that is what I had in the fridge. Left out yeast (didn't have any). I also added a splash of dry white wine, because, well...that just makes everything better! Thanks for posting!!!

Made this as we are looking to try the Paleo diet. We didn't really like anything about this meal. The spaghetti squash was still crunchy after putting in the microwave for the recommended time. The sauce was not good. I've had good Paleo meals but this was just bad.

I think I might add some sausage to it.  Not one of my favorite meals.

I really tried to like this dish, especially after all the preparation; however, it was terrible.  Couldn't eat a second bite.

I made this with mushroom instead of eggplant and heavy cream instead of coconut milk and it was FANTASTIC!

Delicious fake-out Alfredo sauce, IMHO!  Thanks so much for the recipe.  I made only 2 slight changes:  Before I added the spinach, I added some nutmeg.  The sauce is wonderful without it, but the nutmeg really takes it into the realm of Alfredo, for me.  Also, I stirred the nutritional yeast into the sauce, instead of putting it on the top, for aesthetic reasons.  LOVE this healthy alternative, great with some grilled chicken and steamed broccoli.   I will DEFINITELY make again!
