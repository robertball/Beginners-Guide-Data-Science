I decided to make this for my hubby and I last night because we like both Amaretto and Champagne, so why not try them together? It was not to our liking! It made us both feel a little sick, I won't be trying this one again!

This drink depends on what kind of champagne you use.  I called a liquor store and they gave me three kinds of champagne I could use (Not all three together!)  I chose the medium expensive one and it worked great.

This was ok. The amaretto was too overpowering for me. Next time I would use a lot less.

Everyone I know rated this 0 stars but  even though they were kind enough to not place their reviews on your site, while I on the other hand highly approve of this delectable treat. Thank you for sharing this idea.
