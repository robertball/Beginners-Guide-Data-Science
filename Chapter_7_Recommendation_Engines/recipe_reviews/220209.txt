These were crispy but I didn't really detect the ranch flavour like I wanted to.  Next time I'll either reduce the milk or leave it out, and I'll swap the bread crumbs for panko breading.

I don't care for fish, so I made this for my boyfriend and his son.  Because of their reaction, I eventually took a bite to see what all the fuss was about.  This is good, according to me.  According to them, it is outrageously delicious!  They absolutely loved it, and not a bit was leftover!  I used my homemade seasoned breadcrumbs, but still went ahead a seasoned as the recipe states.  Like other reviewers, I used olive oil to moisten the crumbs.  Instead of laying the fish on the foil lined baking sheet, I lightly sprayed a cooling rack with Pam, placed that on the baking sheet, and put the fish on the rack.  This resulted in crispy fish on both sides, and also allowed the fish to be easily moved to a plate without leaving any of the coating behind.  I served this with a dollop of goat cheese and herb ice cream, for dipping.  It was a huge success.  Thanks for a great and easy recipe Mike :)

With the problems with not having a ranch taste, I used dry ranch with Panko bread crumbs with some Tony's more spice.  I did not use cooking spray except on the pan where I placed the fish.  Really good!  Served with tartar sauce.

I just want to say that I've made these before but minus half the ingredients you used here.  All I used is olive oil, Parmesan cheese, parsley flakes, paprika, and salt and pepper to season. (Maybe a little garlic and herbs seasoning) but all the spraying with cooking spray sounds unhealthy, you should next time try to coat the fish with the oil

The BEST!  My husband, my 3.5 year old, and I gobbled this up.  I used olive oil instead of cooking spray.  And I omitted the celery salt (don't have any).  I have been using allrecipes.com for years and this is the first recipe that prompted me to rate and review!

This was absolutely delicious! And highly recomend it! It's easy and delicious. I put just a bit extra ranch and it was a perfect amount, a good balance. Also used olive oil instead of spray and used italian bread crumbs, it added extra flavor to it. Worked great!

My family loved this! Very tasty!  I agree with other reviewers that you should use olive oil instead of cooking spray.  Gives the fish more crunchiness.

This dish was very easy to make and delicious!  I didn't have ranch dressing  or celery seasoning so I omitted those two ingredients and the fish was still very flavorful.  

I will definitely make this again!

Very good recipe. I read through the reviews before baking. I also placed mine on a cookie cooling rack on top of a cookie sheet to bake. Worked great! Both sides got nice and crisp! Added a little extra paprika, and left off the basil because I didn't have any. It was very good. Will probably make again.

To the "reviewers" who complain about tilapia based not on this recipe but on it's diet, let me give you some other garbage eaters to avoid - catfish, shrimp, all the bivalves, abalone... getting the idea?  Anyway, on to the recipe. I drizzled olive oil into the crumb coating and let the fish rest for about 15 minutes to make sure the crumbs would adhere during baking (I always do this, it really helps!). Wonderful!

Fan-TASTIC!  I used Panko, and added a smidge' of Creole Seasoning.  I sprinkled a bit of olive oil on the top, instead of cooking spray.  It browned beautifully on top and bottom, and was nice and crispy.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

We hadn’t had fish in a while, so I decided on this recipe.  I went about this quite a bit differently than the recipe instructs, but I think my end result was similar to the submitter’s intent.  Here’s what I did.  I skipped the cooking spray and milk completely.   And to avoid a soggy bottom I only coated one side of the fish.   I dipped one side of the fish in flour, then the ranch dressing, and then coated it with panko, instead of breadcrumbs.  I placed it in a baking pan panko side up. I then combined the parmesan and dry seasonings and sprinkled that over the panko.  And then drizzled a little melted butter over the top.  I assembled this in the afternoon, refrigerated it, and popped it in the oven at dinnertime.  I baked mine at 400 degrees for 20 minutes and it was perfectly cooked.  This was very good!  Both Hubs and I really enjoyed it.  I would make it again using my method because I thought it was a little easier.  Next time I might try tossing the parmesan/seasonings with melted butter before sprinkling it over the panko, instead of drizzling the butter on after.  And I also didn’t think the flavor of the ranch dressing was even noticeable, so you could skip the ranch and just use beaten egg.  Good recipe!

My family really enjoyed this dish but as the chef of the family I must say preparing this was definitely not "quick" as the description entails.  It was involved and quite messy.  I don't normally like to bread things because I simply do not like the mess....however, the outcome of this recipe was worth it.  The taste was great and it was crunchy.  The leftovers were great between two pieces of white bread, pickles, cheese, and onions.

Tilapia nowadays is farm raised under the strictest conditions.  I too would not eat Tilapia from Lake Victoria in Uganda, but any Tilapia you can buy in the USA is fine.  The recipe is great.

It was perfect! it didn't taste like fish, so my kids totally scarfed it down, and went for seconds! I didn't have all the spices so i substituted the parsley, basil and celery salt for a garlic and herb seasoning i had on hand. still perfect!

This was SO good. I did add 1/2 tsp chili powder and 1/2 tsp Old Bay (a MUST if you live in Maryland). I used unseasoned panko bread crumbs. It was a little salty, so I may eliminate the celery salt and seasoned salt, since there are so many other seasonings. I definitely didn't need as much flour...maybe 3/4th cup. It cooked beautifully and was a nice presentation. My 10 yr old daughter had fun helping me. I served it with steamed broccoli and angel hair pasta. I will definitely make this again. Thanks, Mike!

Excellent excellent excellent! Did I mention it was really good? Moist, flavorful, and easy to prepare, although kind of messy.

I did a few small things differently, but overall I stuck to the recipe as written. Instead of dredging the fish in the flour first, I tossed some flour in the breading bag to make sure more breading that flour stuck to the fish (it was also less messy that way!), and I sprinkled some extra Parmesan over the top of the fish before serving. 

I thought we were going to have a fight break out over the last piece of fish- next time, I'll have to make more!

I loved the taste! I would reduce the quantity of milk though to bring out the taste of the ranch dressing. 

You can also use garlic bread crumbs instead of garlic powder + regular bread crumbs.

Sorry but I guess I am in the minority here.  I just really didn't care for this recipe all that much.  It wasn't terrible but it wasn't anything special either.  I will find another way to cook tilapia.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and I felt that this fish had very little flavor and I will not be making it again.

Very good recipe and, as noted by others, very flexible. I too had no Ranch Dressing but was able to substitute.

Great flavor in this one. I used Italian Style Bread crumbs and I was afraid it would be too "spice-y" but it wasn't at all. The texture was good too. I will try to get thinner tilapia next time around because i noticed that the best parts were the thin ones and the edges where it was a bit crunchier. (SIDE NOTE: I paired this with "Roasted Asparagus with Parmesan" from this site and it was a wonderful pairing. I just put the asparagus in to cook for the last 7 minutes of the tilapia)

This is the most flavorful tilapia recipe I've ever made or tasted!  Normally I follow the original recipe first, to see how the author intended the flavors.  This time, while reading through reviews, I substituted olive oil for the cooking spray, and added 1/4 tsp of Creole seasoning as others suggested.  It was FANTASTIC!

This was very good. I was hoping to taste the ranch dressing a little more, but my hubby thought it was perfect as is and there wasn't any leftover. I will make this again. I might just cut back on milk to see if I can taste the ranch a little more. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is awesome . i love tilapia but was looking for a new way to cook it and this was perfect. I've already made it twice since learning the recipe a week ago. The only changes i made were that i use garlic and butter croutons to make my breadcrumbs and i use extra virgin olive oil instead of cooking spray other than that this recipe is absolutley delicious.

Wonderful and easy recipe.  I forgot to use the parmesan cheese (mom moment).  I will be sure to include it next time, but it was delicious either way!!!  Crispy and flavorful.  Yum, yum, yum.  Thank you for this recipe.

Definitely very flavorful. Slightly too much for me, however I'm sure it's because my all we had was seasoned bread crumbs instead of plain. That aside, I LOVED the way the bread crumbs form on the fish. Very crispy. We tasted a slight hint of ranch, not to noticeable, which was fine with me.  I will try this again that's for sure, but with the plain bread crumbs instead.

Great tasting, simple and quick.  I made the beading in advance and stored in the fridge. I added the a tablespoon of vegetable oil just before adding the fish instead of cooking spray.  Also the beading was only enough for 6 filets.  You could also get away with 1/3 cup milk and dressing to avoid waste.

This was excellent, and so simple!!  Very nice, crispy parmesan crust on the outside...super moist fish on the inside.  I will be making this again for sure, possibly with chicken next time.

Thought it was tasty and tender.  Also easy to make.  Teenage son and I did it together for mothers day and we both enjoyed it a lot.  We didn't have quite enough bread crumbs though, so i would add more.  Also could use a little more seasoning.  Will try it on a rack next time so gets crunchy on both sides, as suggested by another reviewer.

Yumm! I only used 1/4 cup of milk because it's skim and waters it down too much. I also used Italian bread crumbs because it's what I had on hand. My husband and I both loved it!

I followed the directions to a "T". I use batters quite a bit and don't have problems but this batter would not stick to the fish. Finally got the coating on. Came out of the oven cooked perfectly. Juicy, tender but not a lot of flavor in the fish.  The flavor of the coating was great! Going to change it up a bit next time. 

As a side note as the fish cooled down a foul chemical taste developed. Must have been the propellent in the Crisco cooking spray. Verified that it wasn't expired. Next time will just put the coating in a bowl and drizzle some olive oil and mix it that way.

Left out the salts. Skipped steps, no flour or dipping and I  didn't oil the crumb mix. I used Chef John's Ranch and only basted the tops then generously sprinkled crumb mix on top and pressed in. Sprayed  crumbed top with evoo before baking. Really good. The ranch isn't prominent and that is a good thing in my book.  Served with  basil cauliflower "rice" and balsamic carrots.

This recipe might be tasteful to someone else but this was definitely not my family's type of fish. I have eaten Tilapia before and enjoyed it but never baked with bread crumbs. This recipe gives the fish a very different taste. My mother believes that it is the Parmesan cheese. However, I believe the recipe brings to much seasoning to the crust and not enough to the fish. It just tasted too bland and I don't care for dishes like this.

This recipe was crispy but way too salty & complicated. Why put it in the breading,  then the liquid,  then the breading again? Too messy.

I thought this was very good. I used use mayo with the milk,and stirred olive oil into the crumb mixture, but those were the only changes. Next time I will sprinkle filets with a little salt & pepper before the flour. Definitely a keeper.

I don't like fish very much but I loved this recipe. I did follow the suggestions of others and reduce the amount of milk mixed with the ranch and used panko instead of regular bread crumbs. We did spray our foil, but it still stuck. Next time we might try the suggestion of baking it on a rack instead of directly on the foil. Very good recipe so we will definitely be making this again!

First time I've ever done a baked tilapia that was crispy and yummy! I used seasoned bread crumbs instead of plain and didn't use much milk. Very flavorful.

Excellent recipe! Takes an average fish (Tilapia) and makes it really good. Followed the recipe, other than using Panko and olive oil, instead of bread crumbs & PAM. Will make again!

Turned out great! My family really enjoyed. My kids asked me to make it again soon!  In the future, I would bread one tilapia piece at a time in the plastic bag, rather than putting them all in there together which is how I read the recipe.  The ranch dressing was a little bit messy, not sure it is needed, but…

We are not fish eaters but are trying to use tilapia to broaden our diet. we found this recipe really easy and absolutely delicious. The only thing I would say extra it has nothing to do with the recipe but if something could be done to keep the recipe on its reduced serving size while you’re trying to cook it. I had to keep looking at the recipe and every time I looked it had gone back to the original eight servings and I only wanted two. that is a definite drawback with this program as it happens quite often with me. 
Back to the recipe, I changed nothing and truly enjoyed the fish.  Thank you!

After only 15 minutes at 425*F, my tilapias' internal temperature were over 165*F.  So, next time I will either reduce cooking time or temperature.

Very simple way to make fish.  It came out great.  I dont rate and add changes, lol.  Though, we all tweak a bit once we've tried a recipe.  As this stands, I think its a great way to make most fish.

Five stars once you edit recipe for sure.  Totally skip the oil and the spray, also the bag.  No need for them!  Use non-stick aluminum foil in your pan.  I prepared the ranch/milk bowl, flour in another, and breadcrumb mixture in third bowl.  (I always use smoked paprika for extra flavor.)   I dredged filets in flour, then ranch, then into breadcrumbs, placed on foil lined baking dish & into the oven.  I flipped about half way, and they were perfectly browned on both sides.  Delish!

Came out very good and was crispy. I  did not  have any ranch so I used an egg with the milk and lemon and put the dill as well cilantro and chili powder in the breading mixmix. I am on a low sodium diet so I omitted the salt and used celery powder instead of salt, and also used No salt (a salt substitute) I double coated the fish and baked as directed. I was afraid the temperature was too high but it worked just right,  and all the breading stayed on the fish.  Served with tartar sauce and corn, it was very good.

I made this for 6 because that's how many Tilapia you get from a sams club package. I only had fresh basil and fresh parsley and added plenty of both.  I added a tad more garlic because I  like it. There was a lot more milk mixture than needed for 6 and I added 1/4 cup more panko breadcrumbs and needed all of it. It almost was not enough. We all thought it was pretty good but not amazing.  I gave it 7 out of 10.

We really enjoyed this dish but I was expecting more of a sense of the parmesan.  The next time I make it, I will increase the parmesan and maybe a little less flour.

The combination of the milk and Ranch dressing made the tilapia have a heavy taste. I prefer my Tilapia lightly breaded and light. It was way too heavy but had a good taste. I'll stick with my regular recipes.

I loved it. However, I would season the fish with salt, black pepper and a hint of lime and not add salt to the crust as the parmesan cheese is already very salty.

This is for those that said it was messy to make.  Got this idea from a video I was watching.  Buy those thin disposable gloves available almost everywhere, drug stores.  I got mine at the grocery store.  Before doing all the dipping and crumbs,  put one on the hand you use, then strip off when done.  I've tried it and it's great!  Don't feel that the mess is so bad now because my hands are clean!

This was amazing! Have tried with haddock and it was just as good. Used olive oil instead of cooking spray. Definitely a keeper!!

Don't really like farm grown talapia to much, but this recipe made it yummy! To make lower fat I used yogurt instead of ranch dressing but did add the milk.

Oh my goodness!!! Love it!!!  I never fail to mess up fish and I followed the recipe and directions and it turned out PERFECTLY!!! I am so excited to say I made fish that turned out delicious! I couldn't wait to eat it! So yummy I had two servings! My kids and husband loved it too! My husband is the real cook of the family and for him to say it was good was the best for me!
Definitely keeping this recipe and sharing it with the world! For me as someone who can't cook fish to be able to cook with ease this needs to be shared!

This recipe taste like fish sticks from a box.  It wasn't bad but it was not great either.  I followed the recipe exactly except for the celery salt.  I have a hard time believing that the salt made that big of a difference. So kids may enjoy but I am not  a fan of this recipe.

Just made this for dinner, and I had to make this my very first review on AllRecipes.  I was expecting my kids (8 and 4) to turn up their noses at this just like they do every time I make fish.  (To my knowledge, neither one of them has actually ever eaten an entire bite of fish in their lives because they protest like I am torturing them.)  I was utterly shocked when they both not only took a bite, but continued to eat!  My 4-year-old even asked for seconds!  Hubby didn't complain, either, and said it was good despite the fact that he is not a "tilapia person".  Followed the recipe exactly (except for celery salt -didn't have any.).  Thank you for the awesome recipe!  This is a keeper!

Used olive oil instead of cooking spray and omitted celery salt and onion powder cause I didn't have it on hand. Also subbed ranch for an egg cause I was lazy. Tasted pretty good but what made it come together was drizzling lemon juice on top after its baked. DELICIOUS. The lemon juice brought the flavor together. Will cook it again and maybe try the ranch to see if it does make a difference.

This was really good,but it took a long time to get together and was pretty messy.  Of course, I was drinking a glass of wine when I made it, so maybe that's why!  At any rate, everyone really liked this, even the non-fish eaters.  The only thing I did differently from the recipe was I used Panko breadcrumbs. Will I make again? Maybe. I might try to find a little quicker way to fix Tilapia first.

I've made this twice now and my husband loved it! I was only making  two pieces so I had to reduce the quantities. I didn't use milk, just ranch dressing. The second time I used a mixture of Panko and regular breadcrumbs.  I think I liked it better with the regular breadcrumbs.

I bought tilapia the other day having never cooked it and having very little experience with cooking fish in general.  This recipe was fantastic! I had to omit the paprika and celery salt because  i'm out of both, and i used a little lemon pepper in addition to the regular black pepper. I used olive oil instead of cooking spray on the breadcrumbs, and  a fat free ranch dressing to keep it as healthy as possible.  I will definitely be making this again! We loved it.

Reviewing since we can't make notes. Good mix of spices, maybe a little more parmesan. Cooking method way too messy. Dip in olive oil, place on sprayed foil or parchment and bake on top shelf at 400 for 25 minutes.

I've been making this recipe for a couple years now and I always use either cod or haddock and my husband, son and I LOVE it but I just learned of a HUGE game changer......USE PARCHMENT PAPER!!! I had tried every different which way to get the bottom of the fish to be less soggy and thought it was hopeless but parchment paper worked perfectly so it's even better now!

Turned out delicious!! Even my hubby who doesn't really care for fish loved it. I used olive oil in the bread crumbs instead of cooking spray and I also mixed the breadcrumbs, cheese and seasoning all right in the ziplock which worked perfectly (who wants to dirty another bowl?!) I served this with balsamic roasted veggies (asparagus, grape tomatoes, and baby carrots) and it was a great meal- will be making again!

I made this following the recipe except I added Old Bay seasoning instead of celery salt (because I didn't have any celery salt).  I added  2 T. olive oil to the bread crumb mixture.  My family (who don't really care for fish) loved it.  I will definitely be making this for my family again!

I omitted the celery salt, and Parmesan cheese and used regular salt instead of seasoned salt.  With the exception of those things, I followed the recipe exactly and it was very delicious!  The breadcrumbs turned out crispy, while the fish stayed juicy inside.  Thanks for the tip on spraying the breadcrumbs with non-stick spray to get them to stick to the fish better.

This turned out very tasty and moist. I did change the recipe slightly however, but just because  of personal preference. Instead of spraying the breading mixture, I added vegetable oil one teaspoon at a time and mixed it well before adding more. I ended up using 5 teaspoons to moisten the breading. Otherwise, I followed to recipe as written.  This is my new best recipe for baked fish. I think this will also work well when fishing season starts and hubby brings the fish home.

This was really yummy. I was a little disappointed that I couldn't detect the ranch. The only thing I did different was that I didn't spray the bread crumb mixture with cooking spray.

As stated by others, I would leave out some milk. Also, I didn't wet the breading mix, I skipped that step and it was fine. I couldn't really see how it was necessary to do that, if it makes a difference in crispness, someone let me know and I will try it.  I used olive oil in place of  the spray as well and the flavor was great,  my husband LOVED it. I am not a fish fan, for me, it was edible which is all I can say for any fish dish.

Fabulous.  Makes tilapia a gourmet meal.  It's a bit labor-intensive and lots of dishes to clean but so what?  I used panko bread crumbs which I'm sure added positively to the end product. Give it a try....even fish 'haters' will love this one!

This was an amazing variation to a regular baked tilapia recipe! My fiance and I especially loved the ranch dressing that was used-gives it such a unique flavor! I didn't have all the spices on hand, but I just used what was in my cupboard, and it still turned out great. This is great for a quick dinner.

I make this so often that I just leave the mixture in the fridge.  Seriously don't make tilapia any other way.  Use olive oil instead of cooking spray. Adjust the spices according to what you have on hand, and add more of what you like.  Did find that I was using about half the amount called for of ranch/milk mix, so have halved that (may need more for bigger fillets)

I was really surprised at how well this taste. My husband even liked it and said he could have this meal once a week.  I changed the bread crumbs for Ritz crackers  and took out the paprika.  This was really good.

The only change I made was to add crushed cilantro instead of parsley because I didn't have any.  I loved that it came out golden brown and was seasoned well.  It was very good, and I want to definitely make this again.

Very tasty. Followed the recipe for all but the ranch dressing. Didn't have enough so did half ranch and half roasted garlic caesar dressing.  Turned out amazing. This goes on our top 3 fish recipes.

After reading the reviews I had to make this. Like others I made a few changes: used olive oil rather than spray and made it really simple by using the Italian Seasoned bread crumbs with Romano cheese that I had in the cupboard. Used light Caesar dressing as I didn't have Ranch and it was awesome!! My boyfriend and I both gobbled it up. Feel like having it again tonight!!

I cook a lot of chicken recipes so using Tilapia instead was a nice way to change things up. My boyfriend isn't a huge fish fan but he loved this recipe. I loved the seasonings of this fish and it was enough to fill you up but also light enough for something healthy. I paired this with roasted broccoli and instant mashed potatoes for a quick and satisfying weekday dinner. Yum! I will definitely be making this again.

This is an excellent recipe.  I used flounder because that is what my family prefers and used Panko crumbs.  It should be noted that this recipe is taken from Gordon Rock's Fish Cookbook.

This was delicious. I agree with others about not tasting the ranch but no big deal it was still delicious. I used bottled ranch dressing and carnation milk. I also used Italian flavored bread crumbs and made everything else exactly as is. I think the crumb mixture is what gave it all the good flavor. I don't know how important it is to spritz the crumb mixture with the Pam but all I know is it stuck to my fish very well so don't leave that step out to be safe. It may cook really fast on 425 degrees so just watch your fish. Mine was already done in like 12 minutes. Don't forget to grease the pan like i did, otherwise the fish will stick.

I have made this several times now and it always turns out great. A few times I have not had Ranch dressing on hand so I just squeeze in a tablespoon or so of mayo and it really seems to not affect the taste at all. I have used cod, tilapia, and flounder fillets and it all tastes great- definitely my favorite baked fish recipe.

I never have leftovers when I make this. The hubs will eat 3-4 fillets, and the neighbors can somehow always smell it baking, lol.

I substitute 1/2 C. crushed whole grain crackers for half of the bread crumbs. It gives it a little extra crunch, as well as a lovely nutty flavor.

I generally don't like fish, but this is amazing! Thanks for sharing!

I used almond milk and seasoned bread crumbs.  I did not have parmesan cheese, onion powder,celery salt, or garlic powder.  I cooked it for 20 minutes and it was perfect.  Delicious!  I will definately make this again.

I decided to do something different for dinner and came across this recipe. I wasn't sure about the milk and ranch dressing mixture but I tried it and I must admit it was delicious. Instead of using the spray I used extra virgin olive oil (which is a favorite of mine) and I used croutons (garlic and cheese) instead of the bread crumbs. I also made creamy spinach and jasmine rice and everyone went back for seconds. It was truly a hit VERY DELICIOUS!

LOVE This recipe!! Very good! I did add some dry ranch seasoning to my bread crumb mixture to enhance that ranch flavor! My only changes were that I left out the milk I seen no reason for it! Yummmm! next time im going to try this with Panko bread crumbs!

9/14 pretty easy. i baked 3 thawed mahi for 20 minutes and 3 frozen solid for 30 min. They came out basically the same. Maybe try less time for frozen next time. I cut the pepper to half but added all paprika
2/17 I baked 5 half-thawed tilapia for 30 minutes, all ingredients as written. Miss A thought it was too spicy, so cut back the pepper again. Don't use a qt bag for bread crumb step--either gal bag or another shallow bowl.

My family enjoyed it so much! I couldn't mess it up! It is absolutely delicious! The zesty-ness of the ranch is delectable! My dad does not like fish and he LOVED this dish! Definitely worth a shot. Don't be afraid to add more seasoning to your taste!

I made this tonight and it was AMAZING. I didn't add extra ranch dressing as others did, wasn't looking for a ranch taste. I did however use chipotle breadcrumbs cause I like spicy food. I will make this over and over again.

This was outstanding!! It will become a sure staple in my house. My 3 year old loved it too. He's got a gluten allergy so I subbed corn flakes for the bread crumbs and flour and it was absolutely fabulous - and easy to cut the recipe in half. Thanks!!

for the most part, the dish was decent. i expected the tilapia to be a little more flavorful. but in my opinion, it fell a bit bland. (serve with tomato sauce to make it taste better) if i make this again, i will modify the recipe a little bit.

In the past, I have not cared for the taste of Tilapia, but this recipe helped me prepare a delicious fish dinner.  My suggestion is that you buy fresh fish fillets at least 8" long at the fresh meat counter in your supermarket.  Farm raised  or frozen fish doesn't taste the same at all.

With this recipe, I used Panko bread crumbs.  I didn't put the Panko crumbs in a bag or add cooking spray to it.  Since I was out of Basil, I substituted Oregano.  The recipe turned out to have the most wonderful flavor!  I shared it with my daughter, who also has an aversion to tilapia and she thought she would try it, too.

We loved this recipe! Due to our diet we made a couple changes. We used large catfish fillets, crushed saltine crackers instead of bread crumbs, 1/4 cup of unsweetened almond milk instead of milk, and no celery salt because we didn't have it. It cooked up amazing! Definitely having this again very soon!

i really liked these! I believe it was the ranch/milk mixuture that made the coat stick so well plus all of the great seasonings! we didnt have parsley or celery salt but it was still delicious and coated so great! this mixture could most likely work on chicken, pork ect. Also, we did the olive oil to coat the mixture instead of cooking spray. thanks!!

I just started making fish on a regular basis because I was getting bored with the same old thing.  This was the second tilapia recipe I have made and it was by far the best.  I changed the recipe because we don't have ranch dressing (gasp!) so I did the fish in flour, milk, then seasoned bread crumbs with parmesan cheese.  I didn't spray the crumbs before I coated the fish and instead sprayed the breaded fish with a light spray of Pam.  Used the non-stick foil and both sides came out nice and crisp, no loss of breading.  Will make again for sure!

This is an excellent recipe. The breading has a really good taste. I used Pangasius filets and it really woke them up. A 5-star keeper!

Very good and fairly easy to fix.  I like a lot of bread crumb coating, so I would double that portion.

It was good.  As the other reviewers suggested, I used olive oil to moisten the crumb mixture.  The fish did turn out crispy. I would make this again, but maybe with shrimp or cod.

This was really good! I put the breaded fish on a cookie cooling rack so it baked crispy on both sides. I really enjoyed it, very crispy and flavorful!

Made this tonight and it is fabulous!! Even the one who usually doesn't love fish, loved it (me)! My husband, the fish lover in our house who usually doesn't like tilapia because it's too bland thought it was fabulous. In a pinch, because I didn't have bread crumbs or panko, I substituted crushed Ritz crackers and it was nice and crunchy.  Because the filets I had were thin, I baked them about 10 minutes.  This recipe may be just the trick to get me to serve fish to my family more frequently!

Nice crunch--even better with Panko crumbs.  BTW, for those who don't like Talapia--buy another fish.

This was pretty well received by my family, who are picky when it comes to fish. I use homemade buttermilk ranch dressing, panko crumbs instead of ordinary breadcrumbs, and just sprayed the coated fillets with a little cooking spray. Thanks!

Maybe it's just me, but this was super messy to prepare! Next time I won't use the plastic bag. It's not necessary to entirely coat the fish.  The flavor was really good and my 3 and 4 year old boys surprisingly gobbled it down!

This is a good recipe, and would be great with a few adjustments.  I cooked it to the instructions exactly, and my husband liked it.  Next time I'm going to add dry ranch dressing mix to the dry ingredients to give more of a ranch flavor, and will brush with olive oil to better moisten the breading...it was a little dry.
