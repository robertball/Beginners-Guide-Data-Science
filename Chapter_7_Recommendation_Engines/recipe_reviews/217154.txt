I cut back on the italian seasoned breadcrumbs and instead of ricotta cheese used Philadelphia Herb and Garlic cream cheese.Metaloaf was nice and cheesy tasting and was done in 45 minutes. Leftovers were good also.

I am making this again tonight for the second time.  First time around was hearty and delicious...liked that the mashed potatoes were inside.  I even forgot the Romano cheese and it was still good.  Will add it this time, awesome comfort food recipe! My changes were used half ground beef and half ground pork and did not use 1/4 cup of olive oil..seemed unecessary and it was. Delicious!

Thank you! Such a versatile and yummy recipe. My few changes were using ground turkey and 1 russet, 1 sweet potato and 1 yam for the potatoes which worked wonderfully.

This was AMAZING! I loved every bite and look forward to eating leftovers tomorrow, though I had to practice some retrainst at dinner time to have leftovers!  I didn't have the correct cheese and do not like ricotta, so I used parmesan cheese in place of the romano and I used 4 ounces of cream cheese in place of the ricotta. The result was superb!! Thanks so much for helping me find a fantastic meatloaf recipe!

Thought this was bland and noticed that most reviews did not follow the recipe as written. I liked the concept and will try again but will used a garlic mashed potatoe, add a tomatoe based glaze on top and try a different meatloaf recipe.

Great recipe!  The whole family loved it.  It really lends itself to experimentation.  I used crushed Caesar croutons instead of bread crumbs and 1/2c Parmesan cheese instead of Romano in the meat mixture, and 4 oz of cream cheese and 1/4c of mayonnaise instead of ricotta cheese in the mashed potatoes.  Highly recommend this recipes!

This meatloaf was delicious, and I don't even care much for meatloaf! The potatoes inside keep it very moist, and it's relatively easy to make even for the most novice chef. Prep time was longer than anticipated, so make it the night before!

This recipe is yummy!!!  I used different cheeses (colby, and some others I had in the fridge) and it turned out great, and seasoned the mashed potatoes.  I think it could use more seasonings, even though I added a lot of extra on my own (garlic powder, garlic sea salt, oregano).  I used ground moose meat, and I personally could taste a little bit of a game taste.  Although my family couldn't. So...more seasonings would have fit me just great, but I am a seasonings type of person anyways.  This meatloaf was delicious!

This is the most delicious meatloaf I've ever eaten.  By boyfriend said the potatoes in the middle kind of "popped" in his mouth!  I made two loaf pans and they were gone in less than two days.  Only thing I changed was I used fresh dried basil leaves instead of parsley.  Will definetly be making this again and again!

I really liked the recipe idea but wasn't sure about the mozzarella cheese so I subbed cheddar cheese instead.  It came out great.  Next time I will add some  
bacon bits (real) and perhpas steak or worchester sauce.

This is on of my favorites!  I added 1 cup of mushrooms and 1/2 cup of green peppers into the burger. If you put them in a food processor first, the kids wont even know they are in there.

Awesome.  Used only Romano in  mix.  Shaped into a mound on a pizza stone using jelly roll pan to catch grease (was not much).  Mixed 6 servings mashed potatoes with half tub cream cheese and frosted loaf like a cake.  Topped with shredded mozzarella and sprinkled outline with cayenne then broiled afew minutes to melt cheese.  Mine was a heart shape for Valentines Day.  Such a hit

This was hands down one of the best meatloafs I have ever had!  I usually only eat my mom's meatloaf, but this was fantastic. I didn't really taste the ricotta, but the mozzarella added the perfect touch.  I used ground beef and it was extremely moist, I added a tablespoon of heavy whipping cream to my potatoes and butter.  This dish was heaven and I plan on making it again!

Everyone at our table agreed that this was absolutely delicious.  A great surprise because it isn't a typical meat-loaf.  It's a little bit like a meat-loaf shepherds pie, which I bet others have noted but I didn't read any other reviews!

Made this tonight and five out of six loved it...the sixth didn't try it because I put bacon on top and then a ketchup topping while it baked. surprisingly I had most ingredients on hand and I added Worcestershire to the meat mix and covered the mash potato layer with grated cheddar. it took about an hour and twenty minutes to bake to satisfaction. I served it with mini corn on the cob and garlic bread...it was a simple fix and I did use packaged garlic roasted pepper mash potato mix.
all in all it was a hit and ill go to it again, soon.

I've attempted meatloaf numerous times, and never got good feedback from the family until this recipe!!!  I substituted cream cheese for the ricotta, cut down on the oil, used dried parsley.  My sons LOVED it and asked me to make it again......so I'm doing that tonight!!!  Thanks for the recipe!!  I finally found a keeper!!!

This was really yummy.  It's interesting that your photo doesn't show a 9x9 casserole dish as you specified in the directions, but a rectangular sized casserole---I had to go back to the store just for the 9x9!  Anyway, this was really delicious.  I was surprised, actually, because there weren't any herbs or spices in the meatloaf, but it really was very tasty without them.  Not sure why the directions said to use 3 potatoes.  I bought 3 baking potatoes and that was way too much, especially for only 8 ounces of ricotta.  Great going, Blonddee!

This is my family's favorite meatloaf recipe!! Here are my tweaks: 5 russet potatoes, 1/4 tsp. of Garlic Powder & Onion Powder instead of real onions/garlic, I mash the potatoes with 1/2 block of cream cheese instead of ricotta, and use grated parmesan cheese in place of the romano cheese. I omit the salt, because the cheese itself is very salty. Also, key ingredient: GROUND TURKEY instead of beef. It's a bit more pricey, but healthier. My hubby, 5 yr old daughter & 2 yr old son LOVE this meatloaf, and there are usually no leftovers!!

I'm not a meatloaf fan myself, but I made it for my husband and thought it was different enough I might be okay with it.  It was fine, but didn't convince me to like meatloaf. And my husband thought it was a bit too much stuff, I guess the proporations weren't what he wanted...he prefers his meat straight up and his potatoes on the side apparently!  Oh well.

Delicous! My boys loved it and have requested a repeat. I did use 1/2 ricotta and cottage cheese. I recommend dropping the top layer of the beef mixture by globs on top and then trying to spread.

Best meatloaf ever! I did a bacon weave top and it came out amazing! I also used half ground beef sirloin and half ground turkey which made it very moist. Truly delicious!

Disaster. Meat was cooked okay, potatoes turned into a runny mess. Not sure how to keep meat juices from making the mashed potatoes thin and runny. Everybody ate in politely, nobody asked for seconds.

This was Good, but I think I'll stick with Meatloaf with Mashed Potatoes as a Side dish.

I've made this several times. The one addition I make with it is I combine mushroom soup and beefy Lipton onion  soup mix for the top of the meat loaf. The recipe makes at least 6 healthy serving sizes, so I take advantage of it by making individualize portions and freeze and vacuum pack them for future consumption since it is just the two of us generally.......

We love meat and potatoes and frequently add cream cheese inside our hamburgers, so the addition of potatoes to the meatloaf was a great idea! We used Parmesan cheese and cottage cheese because we had them on hand and we added a layer of thin slices of cream cheese between the potato mixture and the top layer of meat. We also put a thin layer of ketchup on top. It was moist and tasty! As with most recipes, variations in the ingredients can create a new flavor sensation. We are going to experiment with different types and flavors of bread crumbs, seasonings, cheeses, and ground meats to personalize this recipe. Thanks for providing a great meatloaf recipe idea! We love this one!

I made this for my husband's birthday since he has always liked meatloaf but I have not been a big fan. I'm the one who went back for seconds even before he did. It was moist and delicious, a real keeper. I made it as written.

Terrific recipe for the rare cold night in Texas.  I followed another poster's suggestion and used flavored cream cheese in the potatoes instead of the cheese.  I cooked the meatloaf / potatoes in a bigger pan and it turned out delicious.  Thank you for a great meal!

We eat lean meat so I used a 50/50 mix of venison and 90% lean chuck.  Made the  "Creamy Mushroom Gravy" from Chef John's "Creamy Mushroom Meatloaf" recipe to serve over the top when it was done.  Next time after 20-30 minutes, I will check the loaf and probably spoon some of the mushroom gravy over the loaf and cover it as it did get a little crusty.  Love the idea of having meat and potatoes in one dish.   I will also try mixing some very lean venison Italian sausage that I made with regular hamburger.  Recipe great as written.   People have their own preferences.  I always read the reviews as there are a lot of good ideas on substitutions if you want to use what you have on hand and not go to the store.

Excellent.  A little more effort and expense but well worth it.  Didn't use bacon on top as shown in picture, just followed recipe.  Got 8 portions, that came out to around $2 each.  Husband loved it, maybe too much, think he'll whine in the future if I make the usual stripped down loaf.  Took 1 hr & 10 minutes at 350 in 9" sq stainless pan to reach 160.

I'm a semiretired gourmet chef, but when I cook for friends and church's and others I tell them you never give up your first love, I fell in love with the cooking of Julia Child when she first appeared on t.v. in my area at eight years old and I decided I wanted to cook til I couldn't any longer. I appreciate your slant on meatoaf I'm si tired if ketchup loaf, cheese is an inspired thing I have a recipe that's very popular with my family it's what I call taco meatloaf and I use taco seasoning for flavoring, but one type has cheese and the other lacks cheese, because of some people's preferences,  either way it's delicious and being I don't know how to post recipes to this website contact them and they will let me know if you wish to obtain the recipe. Thank you.

I attempted this recipe and absolutely loved it! Here are my minor adjustments: I seasoned the meat very well with Italian seasonings, Worcester sauce, garlic salt, pepper, rosemary, accent,salt, onion and minced garlic (all to taste). I let the meat mix marinate for one hour in the fridge. I used Italian blend shredded cheese, no ricotta. I only used two large potatoes and I made sure that I added butter and garlic and onion powder as well as Italian seasons to the potatoes

I have tried this receipt.  I  do make a barbecue sauce consisting of ketchup and vinegar  and brown sugar and  make a sweet sour sauce.I put a piece of  bacon on top then this sauce then in the oven.  I also do equal amounts of lean hamburger and ground turkey meat. Absolutely fabulous.

Loved it! Used 1 lb. ground pork & 1 lb. ground beef. I bought Evans Garlic Mashed potatoes vs. making my own & added cream cheese flavored with  onions & chives vs. Ricotta. Instead of plain salt,  I used several of my favorite seasonings like Lawry's seasoning salt, onion salt, garlic parsley powder & a tsp. of Italian seasoning & dry parsley vs. fresh. I topped mine with partially cooked bacon approx. 30 min. into the cooking process. You can follow the recipe exactly or do as I did & customize it to your liking. I also made a brown mushroom gravy to serve on the side.

This is delicious! This is the first recipe I'm trying from allrecipies and I'm proud of myself.  I did a couple things different: I used ground turkey, fresh mushrooms, and 2 Serrano peppers.  I ran out of bread crumbs so ended up putting a little less than the 1C that it called for.  This made for it to come out "soft" (because the turkey cooks "softer" than ground beef) but I made sure it was >160 in the middle before I took it out of the oven.  It was still very good. I also had to increase the time to 1hour, 30minutes.  I will definitely try this one again, next time I'm

I made this for the first time last night. I ask asked our guests if they would like shepards's pie, meatloaf, or lasagna. Little did I know this recipe is a combo of all three. The only variation I tried was to add 1 lb of pork sausage and I lb. of ground beef together. It was delicious or so said our guests.

Wow...this was awesome!  I ended up with about 2 1/2 lbs ground beef because it was on sale that way at my grocery store - good thing too; I ended up with no leftovers.  I used the Simply Potatoes refrigerated mashed potatoes instead of making fresh and it went perfectly since they were seasoned the way I wanted and it cut back on the time a little bit.

I never rate recipes and I hate meatloaf! I made this for my parents and I grabbed a bite. I couldn't stop eating it! This recipe is delicious!! I will make it again and again for my family. I followed the recipe exactly but I forgot to pick up the ricotta cheese. So, I used a country crock loaded instant mash potato you would buy in the refrigerated section. It worked perfectly. Thanks for a great recipe and a nice change of pace.

My husband asks for this all the time! It's definitely our favorite. I have used cream cheese in place of the ricotta before; this recipe is easier than it sounds, and lends itself to variations quite nicely.
Thanks for sharing!
