I'm the one who submitted the recipe, and I have since made the fish on the stove top in a skillet.  I think it is much better, the sauce is much thicker and the fish more tender!  Give it a try!

There is a serious problem with this recipe that needs to be corrected.  200 degrees for an hour will not cook this fish, not even close.  I thought it seemed a bit strange but followed the recipe as stated. As they say, fool me once...  I actually served a dinner party of four (one, a chef) with warm, uncooked fish, bites were taken before we realized what had happened.  I had to pull the plates off the table, pan sear the fillets, and re-serve piles of fish, peppers and tomatoes.  Attractive presentation was long lost.  I also added a shake of chili powder on each, as the paprika sauce itself was a bit one-dimensional.  Please request to have this error fixed before others suffer the same embarrassment - to say nothing of the health implications....

Loved this meal, & so did my fiancee. One thing-I think you meant 300 degrees, not 200. Thanks, I'll be making this again.

This. Was. Awesome! Noting the other reviews, I combined the oil and spices in a 1 gallon ziploc, coated the filets in the mixture inside, and pan-seared them to seal in the flavor before baking. Put the seared filets atop the veggies, added the 1 c water to the ziploc to incorporate the remaining spices therein, poured that over thew hole dish and baked at 400 for about 30 minutes. Other minor substitutions were orange pepper for red, quartered grape tomatoes for large sliced, and cilantro for parsley.  Served this with a medditerranean quinoa that had chopped shallots, toasted pine nuts and raisins, and lemon feta asparagus - everyone LOVED it. Paired nicely with a dry Prosecco!

This was amazing.  I added green bell peppers as well.  I did not have parsley on hand so I went without it and it was still delicous!

This was such a tasty dish. I made this last night. There were no leftovers and everyone went for seconds. I made a yogurt garlic sauce to compliment the spicy fish. I served with brown rice and creamed spinach. The sauce from the fish was so good over the rice. I will definitely make this again. I did follow someone else's comment and baked for 30 to 40 min on 400 degrees. 200 degrees for an hour just didn't sound right. The fish was tender and just melted in our mouths. Thanks so much for sharing.

Subbed 2 cans tomatoes for the chopped and it worked quite well.  Not a heavily flavored dish for the title "Moroccan" but it was tasty.  I'll make it again but probably double the spices.

I loved it, my husband however did not and couldn't say why.  We are both big spicy fans so it wasn't that however I would cut down a little on the cayenne pepper.  Oh and I cook it in a pan on the stove top, thanks Jessi for the idea!

This is a great recipe but BEWARE of the chicken bullion if you're keeping kosher. Jewish dietary laws prohibit meat and fish in the same meal. That said, I've made this recipe sans bullion and added tomato paste, chickpeas and long green hot peppers since that was how we usually make it. I know recipe Nazis, it's no longer the same recipe. But if you're looking to replace the bullion, you need to add a little extra oomph.

Yes, the temps for this is way too low. I baked it at 350 for 40 to 45 minutes. I have made this 2 times now and it's wonderful. I served it with Olive and Garlic flavored Couscous, Asparagus and warmed Pita bread. Tasty dinner for 4.

I have not submitted a review for a recipe in a long time, but this was worthy of a great review! The spice combination was wonderful and this was so easy. Even my 11 year old daughter who is not a big fan of fish or spicy dishes liked this. I only wish my photography skills were up to par cause the deep rich brick red color that the paprika and red peppers gave this dish was beautiful. I did simmer this on the stove top in a cast iron skillet, so the fish was fall apart tender, but I like the idea that this can be slow baked in the oven for an easy, no sweat dinner on the Sabbath. Thank you for sharing this.

The temperature of the owen should be about 200 degrees Celcius! In 95 degrees C the waterly solution or the oilish mixture dos not even boil, it needs with the ingrediments and the salt from the chicken bouilljon about 110-120 degr. C. So, if you use Fahrenheits, then double the temp.! You may keep the marvelous fish meal warm in ab. 95 degrees (Celcius) so that it doesn´t boil, but still you should add some water if the meal is not eaten at once - whitch is highly inporopable: the fish is great, even prepared of pangasius!

Like someone else, I tried 200 degrees and ended up cooking at 350 for about 25 additional minutes. Aside from that, the dish was just ok. Not a lot of flavor, so the "fishiness" came out in the talapia, which we didn't even know was possible. The peppers and tomatoes were good!

So I loved this for my Shabbat dinner. I did take out the bouillon as its not Kosher but I substituted a Lebanese seven spices blend to keep the flavours balanced. I pan seared the fillets prior to baking for about a half hour at 350

Yes, the fish does not cook at 200 degrees Farenheit.  I think they meant 200. Degrees Celcius.  It should cod at around 350-375 Farenheit and it is a delicious, spicy dish.   My Moroccan  dinner guest was very impressed.

This is an EXCELLENT recipe, and SUPER simple to make! I used Swai fillets because thats  what I had. And instead of cayenne pepper I used garlic powder because my guys don't like spicy. I think the tomato is the centerpiece flavor in here. We LOVE this!

I made it following the recipe, and I really wish I had read the comments first!!
I finished it in a pan and it tasted good. Next time oven at 350F for 45 minutes.
