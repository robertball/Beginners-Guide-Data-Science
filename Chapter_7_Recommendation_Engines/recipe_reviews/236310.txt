I love Baba Ghanoush and this one was very good! I used more lemon juice than called for. I had a hard time just mixing this up in a bowl, so I threw it in the food processor and pulsed it until it was the consistency that I wanted, which worked great. Spicy, garlicky and lemony...a perfect balance...I will be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I loved this recipe! The only things I did differently were to lightly sauté the crushed garlic in olive oil and add cumin powder. It was very good. I've made another version of this where the eggplant was cooked in a slow cooker. This was much better. I'll definitely make it again!

This recipe is great!  It is super easy and my Baba Ghanoush was delicious.  I even added a few red pepper flakes and a spice called Zatar and then some olive oil and it was just like at a restaurant!  Never thought it was this easy.  You can adjust the amount of garlic, tahini or lemon juice to how you like it.  I baked my eggplant in the oven.

This is my new go-to for eggplants. It was easy to throw together for a party and smoother than traditional hummus. I didn't have parsley, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Will be making this again.

I roasted the eggplant in thin slices on the grill with a lite spray of olive oil. It gave the final product a great smoky taste.

This was my first time eating and making baba ghanoush.  The garlic cloves that I used were really big, so my baba ghanoush came out extremely garlicky.  That's ok, because I love garlic and I'm sure through eating what I made, I've prevented any colds and flu for the next five years!  Anyway, this recipe was absolutely delicious and super easy to make.

I used a food processor as well and substituted lime juice for lemon juice as it was all I had in the house. I also added between 6-8 sun-dried tomatoes. Delicious!

Good recipe. Real ingredients. Much much better than the store bought stuff. I prefer more tahini though... personal preference.

Excellent recipe. Added less tahini And more lemon juice to suit our tastes better. Seems like it has lots of potential for different twists of flavor :) yum!

Resist the urge to add a little extra tahini. I had a tub of it and wanted to use it up. I added 50% more than recipe called for and it tasted more like hummus than babaganoush.

Did not taste like the authentic taste I’m used to. I think what’s missing is to roast the eggplant over open flame so you get that smokey flavor.

I make this for my Saudi husband and he swears it is better than any he’s ever had: restaurants, mom, maids, etc. idk if the ratios I use are correct because the size of an eggplant is so subjective. I always just take it easy on tahini and use plenty of lemon. The chili pepper flakes elevates it above other babaganoushes!

I made this for a football party and it was a huge hit. This is incredibly easy to make and since trying it we are hooked on it. I have made it probably half a dozen times in the last few weeks from my fresh garden eggplants. Love it!!! Thank  you for a great recipe.

Didn't care for the flavor of this with the tahini.  Maybe I am just partial to the one at my favorite Middle Eastern restaurant.

I roasted the eggplant on a burner on top of the stove as I prefer the smokier flavor this gives to the dish! Use a pair of tongs and a pot holder to help with the turning. Oh yes, before I do the eggplant, I cut foil to place under the burner but leave room for the flames for easy cleanup. Used just 3 cloves of garlic, 2 tbspn. of olive oil and no parsley. I will make this again.

I have never made Baba Ghanouj because it always seemed intimidating. I was a little skeptical because the recipe calls for cooking the eggplants in the oven, I always read you had to cook them under coals. So I threw caution to the wind and cooked them in the oven and the dish came out delicious.  This is definitely going in the recipe box :)

I loved it and i will definitely make it again. All i changed was adding 1/2 tsp of cumin and some paprika. I also omitted the parsley and pepper flakes.

Very easy, very good. I definitely loved it. Way, way better than store bought. Just followed the recipe, except for mixing everything together in my food processor. Super simple.

Easy to prepare and full of flavor!  I just added a little more lemon.
