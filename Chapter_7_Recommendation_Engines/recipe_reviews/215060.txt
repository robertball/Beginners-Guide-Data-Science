I followed this recipe exact only using reduced fat mayonnaise/sour cream--I made no other changes. I mixed this up this morning as I wanted it to have time to sit in the fridge until dinner. I served this with a veggie platter (baby carrots, sliced cucumbers, raw broccoli and plum tomatoes), it was one of the best dips we've had in a long time. I was doubtful that fresh herbs could make *that* much of a difference. BOY, was I wrong!

Jackpot! Hubs and I both responded favorably at the same time as this hit our mouths.  A most excellent, fresh tasting dressing with a perfect balance of each of its components.  Other than using equal amounts of the mayonnaise and sour cream I prepared this exactly as written. I loved the combination of herbs and I was particularly fond of the addition of the minced red pepper, which added a lot of character - in flavor, in color, and in texture. One of the best dressings I've tried from this site; one that could easily make me eat a lot more salad!  I served this with a tossed salad of baby spinach, Romaine lettuce, English cucumber and sliced avocado.

The use of fresh herbs and veggies instead of powders makes a BIG difference.  If you're going to use powdered this and that, may as well buy a pouch of dried Hidden Valley!  My Family gave a hearty round of applause on this one.  They didn't think Ranch dressing could be made from scratch and I made a lighter version of this with yogurt and light sour cream!  The longer it sits the better it tastes.  Made this two days before we ate it since plans changed.. it was loaded with flavor.

I wanted to love this dressing; I've been making my own and still looking for a great ranch. I knew two raw shallots would be overpowering, based on past experience. But, unfortunately, just one was too much as well...all I could taste was raw shallot. I'm not sure what to do about that, but if I figure it out, I'll finally have the homemade ranch I'm looking for.

This was very tasty and simple enough to make. I had to resort to dried dill as it's the one herb I didn't plant this year. I cut back a bit on the cilantro and I'm very glad I did as it was a predominant flavor. I think the full amount would have been far too much and masked the other flavors in this dressing. This was wonderful on a fresh garden salad.

This dressing is very good and beautiful to look at as well. I added twice as much lemon juice because I like a tangier ranch, and the flavour was great. Used it last night as a dip for oven baked zucchini sticks, and I will use it tonight for garden stuffed potatoes, from this site. Thanks!

Finally! A ranch dressing that doesn't resort to garlic and onion powders! Those two ingredients impart a nasty taste, so why use them when fresh garlic and fresh onions are so readily available and inexpensive? Most people like a fresh taste on their fresh salad, and this dressing delivers, in spades! The only change I made was to double the lemon juice, because upon the initial taste, I wanted a little more bite to it. But that was just how I felt on that particular day. That change was quite minor, and totally subjective.  It's just about as close to a perfect ranch as you can concoct. Edited to add: For the reviewer who felt the shallot overpowered the dressing's taste, this problem can be obviated by blanching the minced shallots for about 30 seconds before adding to the mix. It will tame the sharpness of raw shallot and help it "play nice" with the other ingredients.

I love this recipe!  I made it as a dip and not a dressing, using 3/4c sour cream and 1/2c mayo (no milk).  My daughter will eat veggies dipped in ranch, so I need a healthy ranch dip.  I omitted the shallot because it is so pricey and I did not want too much raw onion flavor.  I also used the red, yellow and orange sweet baby peppers because I always have those on hand.  I am certain I used a bit more than called for.  Served it for a family gathering and everyone loved it.

I love the fresh herbs in this recipe.  No more Hidden Vally packets for me!  My only complaint is that when I made the recipe, I used home-made mayonnaise and it came out very runny (probably because the home made mayo is thin).  Maybe next time I'll try with store bought....

I didn't have buttermilk so I just used sour cream and half and half. Added more pepper and a little more lemon juice as I didn't have cilantro either. Used orange bell pepper instead of red. Used fresh chives instead of onions and shallots. I did not add salt as I added in grated asiago cheese which is usually pretty salty. The fresh chives and parsley gave it a greenish tinge, but it was quite tasty.

Dy-na-mite! I left out the cilantro as my boyfriend thinks it tastes like soap--and it overpowers everything once he tastes it. It didn't need it though! I love adding buttermilk; aside from the great flavor it adds, it also makes the dressing "looser" and easier to toss the salad and coat it evenly.

We loved this dressing, all the fresh ingredients certainly wakes a salad up and your taste buds. As with any homemade dressing I make up several hours prior to using so the flavors can marry. Didn't have shallots but didn't really miss them, had plenty of onion flavor from the green onions. I think it would be great as a dip or creamy topping in many recipes. I did use light mayo and sour cream to reduce the calories. Keeping this one at the top of my list for dressings.

I didn't have mayo, cilantro or buttermilk. I doubled the lemon juice and added to 1/2 goat's milk to sour it and subbed Greek yogurt for mayo and omitted the sour cream. It was so good, tasted a lot like tzatziki. Thanks LemonLush

We have made this multiple times now.  We got  a hydroponic herb garden during the holidays.  This recipe uses the fresh parsley, dill, and cilantro we are growing.  We served it to our guests at our last dinner party.  It received rave reviews.  We will probably never buy a bottle of ranch dressing again.  Fresh herbs are a huge flavor enhancement.  Outstanding!

This is FANTASTIC. Totally worth using all the herbs and make sure they are fresh. We went to the farmer's market yesterday and made this with farm fresh herbs. It was the best ranch dressing we ever had. I don't think I can eat the bottled anymore. I made another batch today. It's amazing over fresh farm lettuce and veggies also. I just mixed it all up and put it in a small mason jar. Fits perfect. The photo is of all the fresh herbs and veggies before adding the dairy. I didn't change the recipe at all.

This dressing is delicious!  I've been trying to find a homemade replacement for the bottled stuff and we hit it on the head with this one.  I did a blind side-by-side comparison and had the hubs taste both (he's a bottled ranch devotee).  He easily could tell the difference but guess what?  He picked up this dressing and said "I'm using this on my salad now."  If you knew him, you'd know that was a miracle.  I think it is outstanding too!  Thank you!

This is a really good dressing that I'm sure to use again! I used plain Greek yogurt in place of the sour cream and unfortunately, had no red bell pepper on hand. I did use dried shallots, and they worked fine. With no buttermilk available, I tried adding extra lemon juice and some light cream to get it to the consistency I wanted. Also added a pinch of sugar. This would also make an excellent veggie dip. Thanks LemonLush. This is much better than any bottled stuff!

I didn't put either shallots or buttermilk in. I used low fat greek yoghurt instead of the buttermilk and sour cream. It was very, very good.
