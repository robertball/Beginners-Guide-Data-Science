I was a little bit worried when I pulled this out of the oven because it didn't look that appetizing but my doubts were unfounded. It tasted great, my husband, 9-year-old and 2-year-old loved it. My picky 6-year-old didn't, no surprise there. I did change it a little bit. I used 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts and halved the sauce ingredients. I had to use black currant jelly as I couldn't find any red (which may have been why it turned out looking brown and icky?), and I substituted spicy brown mustard for the yellow mustard because I don't like yellow mustard. I put the breasts in an oval casserole dish just big enough for them and poured the sauce over them and cooked according to the directions. I made some brown rice on the side and served the sauce over the rice too, yummy!
I also made this for my family on Christmas Eve and it was a big hit. It does look a lot better using yellow mustartd and red currant jelly too!

Not too bad. I used boneless, skinless chicken breast and followed the rest of the recipe, except I used sliced almonds. The sauce was a little too thin for me. But, my husband liked enough to save the recipe, so next time I might try to thicken it up a bit. Also, I wouldn't call this recipe "spicy," but more tangy from the mustard and currant jelly. But, really better than I thought it would be!

Now I hate it when people do this, but I must admit I changed the recipe a little. I didn't have any current jelly, so I blended the almonds, lemon juice, mustard, and some dried cranberries together. I rather liked how it turned out! Salty, sweet, and savory all at the same time. The flavors definitely blend well together.

My family heckled me after I made this.  Not awful, but I wouldn't recommend it.

This recipe is absolutely delicious!  I even tried it with boneless, 1"-thick pork chops, and oh, boy!  It was a toss-up over which was better.  Tonight I'm hosting a dinner party, and I'm serving the pork-chop version.  I have a question, though.  So that I can spend time with my guests and not have to be over the stove the entire time, I was wondering if I could prepare the chops (brown them) first, prepare the sauce with the almonds, pour that over the chops, cover, and wait until my guests arrive before popping them in the oven.  Do you think this will work?  Will it dry the pork chops out?  I don't want that.  I think it will work, so I'm going to try it anyway.  Hopefully, I'll hear from one of you with an opinion.  If I don't brown the chops too much, I think they'll be juicy and delicious like the first time. They melted in our mouths. Any input is appreciated.  Thanks.

it was very, very good!  The second time I made it, I did it in the crock pot for 4 hours on high!  The last hour or so, take the cover off to let out alot of the liquid.  I also only added half of the almonds, and when I served it on rice, I added the rest of the almonds!  The sauce is so gooood!

We liked the flavor of the sauce, but it was a bit thin.  Also, the cooking time is a bit too long for boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  Be sure to serve this over rice to get all the yummy sauce.
