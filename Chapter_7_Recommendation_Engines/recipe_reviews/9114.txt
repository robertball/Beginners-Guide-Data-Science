I loved this simple salad and received many compliments on it.  I used frozen cranberries, which worked great, and used part Splenda to replace the sugar.  Will make this one again many times!

This was the 1st time I ever used whole cranberries.  I tried it once with dried cranberries but it was too sweet for my taste.  The 2nd time I made it, I used the cranberries in the bag.  As I try to reduce the amount of sugar in my foods, I substituted Splenda for the sugar.  I also used plain nonfat yogurt (that has no extra sugar added) & then just added a tsp. of vanilla.  If you think the dish is too tart, you can just add a little more Splenda.  I'd suggest stirring it before serving as it gets a little watery.  Next time, I think I'll double the recipe.

This salad is yummy!  I first made it for a Christmas party a couple of years ago and since then it has become a staple at Thanksgiving and Christmas get togethers.  My husband is a caterer and serves this with holiday meals and always gets rave reviews!  We usually substitute Splenda for sugar and it is just as good, maybe better that way.  You won't be disappointed!

This recipe rocks.  I was looking for a side dish for my traditional turkey dinner this Christmas that would pop.  This was it.  Both the look and taste were excellent.  It will definitely become a tradition;  my family loved it!  It is a bonus that it is healthy, too.  I can't wait to make it again just for myself!

I was a little skeptical about the fresh cranberries but this was actually pretty good.  The vanilla yogurt tames down the tartness of the cranberries.  I added more fruit which thinned out the yogurt too much. I recommend sticking to the recipe on this one.

We really liked this salad.  I followed the advise of another reviewer and chopped frozen cranberries in my food processor.  That was a very quick and easy way to go.  I left out the celery, used Splenda instead of sugar and doubled the cinnamon.  The only kind of yogurt I had was low-carb spiced pear and it tasted great.  DH and I argued over who was going to get the last serving.  Thanks for the terrific recipe!

Only reason this rates 4 stars instead of 5: I think the added sweeteners (vanilla yogurt, white sugar) are overkill when you already have such wonderful naturally sweet fruits as the main ingredients. I used vanilla flavored Greek yogurt, but will switch to plain next time. To suit my own tastes, I added chicken, and a little more salt and pepper (maybe even some curry powder?) would go well with that protein. Definitely a keeper!

Very easy and very tasty, as well as healthy.  I also received many compliments and was asked for the recipe by several family members. 

I think the sugar could be eliminated or cut down to your liking.

Loved it - and its even healthy.  I make a meal of this stuff.  I use black walnuts as the nuts..and use the food processor for chopping not only the cranberries, but also the apple and celry..its quick and works great.  Thanks for sharing.

This is our new favorite salad! Definitely tasty and it satisfies a sweet craving too. I omitted the raisins (personal preference) and used Craisins for the cranberries. My husband said he would prefer it without the celery, but I liked the celery just fine. Next time I'll add more cranberries and apples in place of the celery. Oh, and red grapes work fine instead of green too! I wouldn't think of this as a holiday salad, but it was great during the summer. Thank you for a keeper!

I had my doubts about this- but Wow! it was awesome!  I used non fat yogurt because that's what I had.  Couldn't wait 2 hours for it to chill to eat some.  Thanks!

Excellent! Crisp and flavorful. Everyone at Thanksgiving dinner RAVED! I've had requests for the salad again at Christmes dinner :o)
I highly recommend one actually minces or processer-chops the cranberries. I quartered mine and they were WOW when you ended up ith a chunk on your spoon. Kinda strong. Also, I used dark grapes in place of the green and doubled the walnuts.

Very good, I used Far Free yogurt. I liked it just that way, however for the non yogurt lovers in my family I added a tad more sugar and they loved it. thanks for the post.

Well...I pulverized the cranberries (not intentionally).  Surprisingly not tart.  Didn't have yogurt so used standard half mayo/half sour cream ETC Waldorf dressing.  Next time I'll coarse chop the cranberries!

I've made this several times and now it's the salad the family repeatedly asks me to make for big dinners, especially the holidays!  I usually cut the cranberries by about 1/3 then add more apples, and I omit the raisins- just our family's preference.  This is the salad I'm bringing for Thanksgiving again this year by request, and will be making at Christmas too.  A definite family holiday staple at our house~

10.30.18  This is a good option to traditional mayo-based Waldorf salad, and I like the way it breaks down nutritionally.  I really liked the tartness of the cranberries in this salad.  That tartness was not only tempered by the sweet fruit, but also the vanilla Greek yogurt (Cabot's low fat) I used. We’re not really into super sweetness these days, so I left out the sugar, just didn’t think it was needed, at least for our taste.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, we enjoyed it.

I have served this for the last 3 years with my Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it.  It's a nice change from the canned fruit cocktail/marshmallow/sourcream salad I grew up with.  It is a little on the sweet side with the added sugar and vanilla yogurt but I think it's a perfect blend of sweet and tart.

I wasn't impressed with this recipe.  It tasted more or less like a fruit salad to me.  I've had a variation of the Waldof Salad made with mayo and although I was skeptical at first that version taste much better.

I think this is a fabulous recipe.  I used dried cranberries instead of fresh, and found it to be really nice. I also cut down on the sugar because the vanilla yogurt and other sweet items were enough for me.  Great..I have made this several times and will keep on making it.

Yum!  Quick and easy - I used my food processor for the cranberries.  I think next time I will throw in some mini-marshmallows or coconut for extra sweetness.

This was a little too tart for my taste. I just felt like it was missing something. I may try it again with more cinnamon and sugar.

Nice colorful addition to the Christmas meal. Great mix of flavors. I did not have problems with it getting watery even with the leftovers. My bet is if you use a thicker yogurt as I did it will not be a problem.

my daughter is always excited about a tasty and healthy dish.  this one is just that.  i did increase the cinnamon and omitted the celery and it was well received. i did it again and substituted blueberries and cherries for the cranberries. i think any favorite fruit would be great.

Very good and easy to make in a food processor. Cranberries add a nice tart flavor. My guests really liked the frosted cranberries on top. Very different than the cranberry sauces I normally make.

I've always liked Waldorf salads, but they were always a little too rich for me. Cranberries brighten the taste and add a welcome tangy note. I didn't have vanilla yogurt, so I used 3/4 cup plain Greek yogurt and it was delish! But then again, I'll toss just about any fruit with some nuts and Greek yogurt and gobble it down.

Surprisingly delicious!  The only change was that I omitted celery as we don't care for it.  But other then that it was very fresh and delicious.

This is a keeper for sure.  I used dried cranberries and would suggest no sugar needed with the sweet vanilla yogurt.  More apple would be good too.

I was looking for a healthy new way to use fresh cranberries and tried this recipe. I didn't have walnuts so I substituted almonds which worked well.  I also substituted Splenda for the sugar and it was a little too sweet for my taste.  I will definitely make this recipe again, but will leave out the sugar/Splenda altogether or use plain yogurt instead of Vanilla.  My husband loved it and actually had leftovers for dessert to calm his sweet craving (in a healthier way)! This is definitely a keeper.

Great holiday recipe!  I have always used Craisins because I haven't been able to buy cranberries...turns out great.  Probably a little sweeter this way, but also less messy.  My husband LOVES this salad and requests it for all holidays/special occasions.  Great way to sneak in a healthy option.

I misread the ingredients when making out the shopping list and bought dried cranberries instead of cranberries and used them anyway.  It turned out great!  The only other change was I didn't add nuts since my daughter has an allergy.  But I didn't miss them at all!

I made this salad for Christmas.  I was trying to find something a little more healthy for my mom who has to watch what she eats.  She loved it!  She ate this instead of her beloved pumpkin pie, and was quite happy about it!  Thanks for the yummy recipe!

This was a lovely addition to our holiday table last year. I served in on Christmas Eve and it was a huge success. My only problem with this recipe is that while it may appear to be a salad, it is definitely more of a dessert. Would be great on a buffet table as a 'light' dessert idea instead of served as the salad starter.

More like a dessert than a salad, but very delicious at that. I didn't happen to have any cranberries in mid-June, so I substituted pineapple.

I have made this recipe many times, substituting other sweeteners - I do not use white sugar in my kitchen. The combination of flavors is amazing:  sweet, crunchy and tangy. Best of all, without sugar, this dish is actually very healthy!

Loved this.  Made for Christmas Eve Party.   Several guests asked for the recipe and for leftovers to take home.  The only small changes I made was to substitute Truvia (Stevia) for the sugar and low fat Greek vanilla yogurt for the vanilla yogurt.

Let me preface this by saying I love Waldorf salad and I love cranberries. I think the combination was good, but when I added the Vanilla yogurt it looked horrible and the yogurt made it too tangy. I wound up rinsing the yogurt off and adding mayo and more sugar. After that, I liked it a lot, but no one else would touch it. Probably I won't make it again.

I like this recipe however, you can do it without the sugar altogether.  No one needs sugar in their food.  Other than that, I like substituting the mayo with yogurt.  You could also use plain yogurt to give it more of the actual Waldorf flavor.  Other than that, not bad.

We like this so much that we had to make it again only after two days.  Not sure there was 9 servings of this salad.  It may have been due to the chopped sized of our fresh cranberries.  To make it more acurate so it could be reproduced I will weigh the cranberries, apple, celery and grapes.  We used Tillamook brand yogurt.

This is an awesome salad.  It has been a it every time I've made it.  I turned it into more of a summer salad by using bing cherries in place of the cranberries, and it was really yummy.  I think it's the vanilla & cinnamon dressing that make it.

I didn't really follow the measurements for the fruits, I kind of just added as much as I wanted of the fruits called for. I did use red grapes instead of green though, I don't like green grapes (to sour). I also used dried cranberries since they are easier to come by. Omitted the raisins, didn't think they were necessary since I was using grapes, used candied walnuts coarsely chopped and didn't add the sugar since other reviewers said it didn't need it. And, I realize as I write this review I totally forgot to add the cinnamon and I still loved this! So glad I went to the store at midnight just to buy the ingredients for this salad, it was worth it.

This recipe is healthy, and delicious!  I made it for the first time as an alternative to traditional cooked cranberry sauce, but it can be made year round, and I certainly will.  5 stars

Amazing!  I used sweetened dried cranberries, so I didn't even add any sugar.  Still plenty sweet enough!  This may even keep me away from my kids left over Halloween candy!

This was really good.  I made it with my Christmas turkey.  Everyone that tried it said it was good even those that didn't like cranberries.

loved it. i used half granny smith and half gala apples. i used plain yogurt with a little vanilla, that's what i had on hand. i, too, chopped the cranberries in the food processor and it did perfectly. next time, for my personal preference, i'll use less cinnamon, just not used to it in my waldorf.

We enjoyed this.  I did substitute Splenda for the sugar and added a little extra.  A nice, healthy salad.

This was pretty good. I think you have to like cranberries in order to like this though.

FANTASTIC - I'm a VERY picky eater and I don't usually enjoy the traditional Thanksgiving sides.  I hosted Thanksgiving for the first time last year and had my husband's entire family over.  EVERYONE  loved this recipe, including my kids (and myself!)  We're going to my inlaws this year and my mother-in-law asked me to bring this!!  The presentation is elegant and it's delicious!

I had my doubts about this recipe but am really suprised with how it turned out! It is really delicious, with the cranberries providing a bright, fresh layer of taste against the sweetness of the other fruits. I substituted bananas for grapes because they are out of season, which worked just fine. Thanks for the recipe!

Yum!
I made this to take to my in-laws for Thanksgiving. They enjoyed it.
Then the next day i made another batch all for my self! 
It makes a good side dish for dinner, or eat it for a low-fat snack!
