Don't be turned off by all the ingredients.  You probably have them all in your kitchen.  Quite easy to prepare.  Need mini food chopper or food processor.  Delicious!

This recipe is outstanding.  I made a lot of unintentional substitutions to use what I had on hand so I wouldn't have to go to the grocery store.  I didn't have tomato paste, so I just omitted it.  I subbed shredded mozzarella for the provolone, 1 beefsteak tomato for the 3 roma tomatoes, spinach and cheese tortellini for the rainbow tortellini, pepperoni for the salami, orange bell pepper for the red, and dried herbs for the fresh (I just used about 1/2 as much, maybe less).  I completely forgot the lemon juice, even though it was right on the counter in front of me.  LOL!  I do think that this recipe makes too much vinaigrette--I only used half, and it was plenty to coat the salad and provide excellent flavor.  It would be good for regular salad, too, so I put the rest in the fridge to use later, but I would halve it next time. I didn't add salt and pepper to the final product, although I did add some to the vinaigrette.  I don't think you need much salt and pepper if at all--plenty of other flavors going on in this salad!

I loved this. I made it for a 4th of July barbeque. I actually made it the night before and put in the fridge without the dressing. That I made in a food processor and poured into the cruet that comes with good seasoning dressing. While it does not hold every drop, you don't need it all anyway. About an hour before serving, I took it out of the fridge and pour about half the dressing on it. Once it came to room temp, I poured about half what was left on it so it was moist but not soggy. Everyone loved it. The tomato based vinergarette was a nice change. The only subs I made were changing out the provolone with mozzarella and omitting rosemary. Purely personal taste. There are alot of ingredients but it's stuff you probably have anyway. Glad I made it the day before because it was a little time consuming. Thanks Nicole!

This was a great side for a hot summer night. It says to serve warm, but I let it sit in the fridge for an hour or two before dinner, letting the flavors really sink in. I also made the following changes: I halved the dressing recipe, but still used 2.5 tomatoes, I added sauteed mushrooms, used red, green and yellow peppers, I omitted the tomato paste and fresh spices because I was out and added red pepper flakes and lots of freshly ground pepper. Instead of grating the provolone, I cut up little cubes adding even more texture and flavor. I think you could add any a variety of vegetables to this recipe and the dressing could be used for a variety of things as well! I would make this recipe again. UPDATE: I made this once again cutting up cubes of provolone, but also added mozzarella balls and used herb paste. Once again, delicious.

This salad is very easy to make and was a big hit. I omitted the fresh rosemary, and used more honey b/c the vinaigrette tasted to tart for me. I will make this salad again but I would woulnd't use red wine vinegar, only balsamic and I would add more garlic. This salad would make a wonderful main dish, served w/ fresh bread!

This is an awesome pasta salad and pretty easy to make, despite all the ingredients. The only thing is that the pasta is listed twice in the recipe, so the Allrecipes shopping list will be wrong.

This salad is awesome! I made it (for the very first time) for a party at work and there were no leftovers to take home. My co-workers liked it so much they took some home with them. I followed another's review and added mozzarella balls, sauteed crimini mushrooms and yellow peppers. I'm not a big rosemary fan so I cut way back on that. Definitely a keeper recipe!!

I really loved the recipe, but the canned tomato paste left a weird taste. I will try with a tube paste or omit. No doubt it's a great recipe!

I made this for Thanksgiving and got compliments on it.  I didn't have red wine or balsamic, so I subbed white wine vinegar.  I also added whole black olives and cherry tomatoes.  I made a 1/2 recipe, which is more than enough for 6 side servings, probably more like 8-10. You could use Italian dressing with some olive oil to simplify this recipe, but the dressing is very tasty.

Very good, the salad has a wonderful taste.  Made just the vinaigrette again today for our regular side salad.  Both are great.

I messed up the dressing after trying to adjust the recipe to 40 servings.  Way too much for my food processor and I was running out of time and patience, so I used bottled sun-dried tomato vinaigrette, which worked very well.  I used the tri-color tortellini, red and yellow peppers, genoa salami and pepperoni.  It looked amazing, so bright and colorful-great presentation for my graduation party!  Oh, and it actually tasted great, too!!

What a great recipe! I was scared and overwhelmed because of all the ingredients; however this was very easy to make! I used balsamic instead of red wine. I also added broccoli, cauliflower, green & yellow peppers and red onions. Since then, I have been making the vinaigrette and using it on regular salads. I definitely recommend this recipe! Thanks so much Nicole!!!

This was excellent.  There were a ton of ingredients, but it came out very well, and we all loved it, including my very picky wife.  This is DEFINITELY a keeper.

This is great! I didn’t use any honey. And I didn’t have balsamic or vegetable oil. (I used twice the virgin olive oil). I also subbed mozzarella!

I would definitely make this again-great for a potluck or something like that. I skipped the black olives and celery due to personal preference but added cucumber.  Everything else as-is. The dressing was reminiscent of a traditional pasta salad dressing but different enough to enjoy something new!

I made this with the ingredients I had on hand, but followed the vinaigrette part as written.   Since I made only half the pasta, I had vinaigrette left over, which I used on a bacon lettuce avocado tomato salad.  SO good
  I'm getting ready to make vinaigrette again to use on a spiralized zucchini salad.

Many people like this recipe and I had high hopes after reading the reviews for this salad.  However, I found that the after roasting the tomatoes and adding the tomato paste, the "tomato base" did little for flavor and served more to add color to what is basically a vinaigrette dressing.  The only flavor seemed to be the vinegar (which is fine when you want that flavor, however, I was expecting a better blending and a stronger tomato flavor given the time it takes to roast and process).  May add more honey and/or more tomato paste next time if I ever make this recipe again.

I have made this several times, to rave reviews! It's always the first dish to disappear at a cookout- I do add a little more honey to the dressing, other than that I follow the recipe exactly. The ingredients take time to prepare but it's well worth it!
