This is so delicious, and very fast & healthy to boot!  I followed the suggestions of previous reviewers and doubled the sauce, added pea pods to the mix, and also scaled the cayenne back a bit for my kids. I will probably use the suggested amount next time - I think it will be zippy without being unbearably spicy.  With those adjustments, I was really enjoying my plate of chicken (on a bed of rice, of course!), but then I went from great to *PERFECT* with the addition of a handful of fresh cilantro leaves.  Could not be better; forty-seven stars!

I thought this recipe was pretty good, but it tasted more like "Ginger Chicken" to me rather than "Peanut Chicken".  I think next time I would cut back on the ginger and double the sacue.  The amount of sauce that the recipe calls for soaks up so much that there isn't much left to really taste.  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe was really okay.  I doubled the sauce like others suggested, but still okay is probably the only word I can use for it.  I didn't find the garlic or ginger over powered the peanut butter,  I could definately taste it.  I probably won't make again.

this is a very tasty (although not particulary authentic) dish. one thing: next time i'm going to halve the garlic. 3 tbsps was a little overwhelming.

Definitely not Thai, but tasted nice nonetheless.  Hubby said he could smell it at the door.  One thing though, cooking time indicated might be too long.  If you like your chicken tender, do not cook for more than five minutes total.

This is a great recipe but I made a few changes.  Triple the soy sauce, peanut butter, vinegar and cayenne and add 2-3 tbsp brown sugar.  I double the chopped peanuts because I like the crunch.  I add the juice of one lime and the wedges and serve it over rice noodles instead of rice.  YUMMY!

This recipe was wonderful!  As with so many of the others, I doubled the sauce because I like the extra "gravy".  The cayenne is just right...spicy heat without being overbearing.  This is also very easy to prepare.  Thanks, Jessica...super job!!

Delicious! I had been looking for something that I could make quickly with what I had left in the house, and this was a wonderful selection. I did substitute a few things (liquid aminos for soy sauce, pea pods and other vegetables for the broccoli) but it was wonderful nonetheless. Thanks, Jessica.

Excellent recipe!  I doubled the sauce and added a rounded tablespoon of sugar to it to sweeten it up.  I also used 1 tsp of powdered ginger instead of fresh.  The sauce has a very strong flavor, so a little goes a long way over fluffy jasmine rice.  MMMMmmm.

What a delicious dish! I modified this recipe slightly. I added 1 tbsp of fish sauce, 3 tbsp coconut milk and 1/2 tsp crushed chili pepper flakes to the sauce. I then served it over coconut rice. (1 cup basmati rice, 1/2 cup coconut milk and 1 1/2 cups water) WOW!!

I am happy to have this recipe - we loved it.  Next time I will make double sauce.  I used salted peanuts and they were great.

Nothing could be easier.  I've been meaning to make peanut chicken for a long time and this was perfect.  I doubled the sauce and next time I will triple it, I'd like a little more for my rice.  Naturally brewed soy sauce is better as it's less salty than the fake stuff.  I also added brown sugar to round out the sauce with a sweet aspect and increased the amount of peanut butter.  Next time I'll try a touch of coconut milk.  I couldn't get nice looking snow peas but I added plain frozen peas to the mix. I also topped with chopped cilantro. It was great.  I'll definitely make this again and keep experimenting.

I made this last night for my very picky husband and he asked for seconds!  It was delicious.  I think the next time I make it I will use reduced sodium soy sauce because it is a little salty.

I've been making this for a couple years now and it's always a hit.  Like most, I double the sauce, but still find it needs a little more spice, so I triple the cayenne.  I also use crunchy peanut butter since that all I usually have, an leave out the dry-roasted peanuts. I use peanut oil instead of olive oil. We like lots of veggies, so I also add red peppers, or sugar peas.  Topping it with fresh cilantro seems to be just the right finishing touch.

This recipe was delicious!  I wish I would have double the sauce.  I added about a tablespoon of cornstarch to the sauce at the end to thicken the sauce up a bit, other than that I didn't change a thing.  I thought the flavor was spectacular!

Pretty good! I would suggest just cooking the chicken with the sauce instead and leave out the broccoli. Gives it a stronger, more intense taste.

This recipe was a hit with everyone.  I made 2 batches - one with chicken - one without for the 2 vegetarians in the family.  Both batches were enjoyed.  I doubled the sauce which worked out well. I also mixed in some green and red peppers, water chestnuts and baby corn. It not only looked colourful but tasted great. I served it over rice and also soft chow mein noodles which I blanched, strained, then stir fried briefly in any sauce remaining in the wok after the chicken and vegetables were removed.   Great recipe.  I will definitely make it again.

Great taste!  Fresh ginger is key to this dish. I added some chicken broth when I realized the sauce wouldn't be enough - even after doubling the sauce ingredients.  I served it over brown rice and sprinkled fresh chopped cilantro over the dish - it turned out great!

Despite a few substitutions, this recipe was fantastic! Instead of rice, I used Japanese udon noodles. Instead of white wine vinegar, I used the same amount of rice vinegar. Also, I used chunky instead of smooth peanut butter, and doubled the amount of chicken.

These minor changes cannot change my opinion that this recipe most certainly equals some comparable dishes I've ordered in Thai restaurants. The ginger perfectly accents the light peanutty flavor of the dish.

I would highly recommend this particular recipe to anyone interested in experiencing something with a distinct flavor that doesn't overwhelm your senses with any one element. Even the cayenne pepper in the amount prescribed failed to make the dish noticeably spicy, so if one prefers a bit of spice, increasing the amount to 1/2 tsp. might be more to one's liking.

Made double the sauce, like others recommended and used ground ginger instead of fresh (added it right to peanut sauce).  Went over really well with the whole family (including the 21 mos old).

The family enjoyed it, served it with rice vermicelli noodles and it was great fun for the kids.  I would add a littler honey or agave nectar to sweeten it next time.  Quite easy and quick.

I use this recipe as a base but make my peanut sauce a bit differently.  I use peanut butter and chicken broth in equal amounts with srirachi sauce, ginger, garlic powder and a few glugs of soy sauce. Heat in the microwave for a minute, stir well and mix with the chicken and veggies. I also prefer to use rice noodles for this recipe.

doubled the sauce but next time I won't double the peanut butter. Too strong taste. I used red pepper flakes for a more authentic taste. We want to try it with rice noodles next time instead of jasmine rice.

Mmmmm.  I did alter...like others I did double the sauce, used low sodium soy sauce and unsalted almond butter - (due to peanut allergy!) and served over rice noodles - unsalted.  Get it??? read the reviews and was concerned about it being too salty!!! It wasn't!!!  Used rice vinegar, and was generous with saki (rice wine) to deglaze pan and to thin the sauce - it does get quite thick. Fried chicken, then veg (brocolli, red pepper, green onion, carrots), both separately. Just before serving heated chicken, veg, and sauce all together,diluted with the saki. Used 2 tsp of Thai chili sauce rather than cayenne for a real nice bit of heat! Used a total of 2 tbsp of garlic and 2 tbsp of ginger - I wouldn't leave either out of the recipe - really key ingredients! SECRET TO THE SAUCE NOT THICKENING IS TO ADD MUSHROOMS TO THE RECIPE!!!!

An outstanding meal.  Exchanged the white wine vinegar for rice vinegar, added 1/4-1/2 cup lightly packed brown sugar (2x heaping 2 tbsp measure), added 1/2 teaspoon powdered ginger with chicken, then again at end to enhance flavour--I can't wait to have the leftovers for dinner tomorrow night! Thank you for sharing!!

I made this recipe following the suggestion offered by many to double the sauce.  I found this to be too strong of a flavor and too goopy.  Perhaps I should've followed the original recipe as it was.  I don't think I'll try this one again as my husband and children didn't like it either.  Even with less sauce I didn't find the flavor that appealing.

This was good, even if I didn't notice the "cut into thin strips" and, against my better judgement, cooked the whole breast!  We would probably increase the sauce as it is sooo good.

Super picky husband (at least with asian food) and he really liked it.  I used half creamy and half cruchy peanut butter.  I omitted the ginger (as we were out) and added a bunch of veggies that I had on hand.  Zucchini, carrots, white onion, snow peas.  I also didn't use the peanuts (again, didn't have any) but I will next time for sure.  They would be just the perfect topping!  Also, we made rice noodles and mixed it in with the veggie/chicken mixture instead of rice--making it a big noodle dish.  

Overall, very impressed.  Will definitely make this again.

This was delicious! I made a couple of changes as suggested... doubled the sauce and I added fresh cilantro to the mix... really gave it a nice flavor addition. I served it over udon noodles instead of rice. Compliments all around! I will be making this again in the future.

I love this recipe and have made it many times. Like other readers, I usually double the sauce. I usually serve this over Asian-style noodles instead of rice, but that's just a personal preference. We use either broccoli or frozen pea pods... both taste great. Overall, a very nice recipe that's easy to alter to one's taste!

i love this recipe. i make a variation of this at least once a week now: thai chicken lettuce wraps, chicken salad, and thai chicken pizza with the sauce, grilled chicken, bell peppers, and some hot chili paste. i do add a couple of tablespoons of water to the sauce to thin it out a bit and make it less salty. i love the versitility of this recipe!

Very rarely do I try a recipe that I feel needs less than 5 stars, unfortunately this is one of them. I made this for my husband and me and followed others suggestions to use crunchy peanut butter and snap peas. I  also tripled the sauce. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. It was very peanut buttery and even had a thick texture like peanut butter. It was very salty. Neither one of use cared for this and I will not be making it again.

Sorry.  Very few recipes get a low rating for me, but we couldn't even eat this.  It tasted too much like just peanut butter (hubby's complaint) and was too salty as well.  I followed the recipe exactly and it just wasn't for us.  Thanks anyway for the post.

My family really enjoyed this dish!  I added shredded carrots for a bit more color and crunch, and substitued cashews for the peanuts.  DOUBLE the sauce, or it will not be enough!  Thanks so much for this great recipe.

This was pretty good and easy. When I make a stir fry, I always cook the meat and remove from the wok, then cook the veggies until almost done, then throw the meat back in for the last minute. Otherwise I always overcook the meat.

This recipe is awsome!!! Had a bunch of the guys over and it was enough to feed all five of us with left overs. I did make some substitutions just because I didn't have a few products. I used crunchy peanut butter (4TBLS) instead of creamy plus peanuts, and regular white vinager and triple sec instead of white wine vinager. I think next time I'd like to add some sesame seeds or cook the chicken in sesame seed oil to give more of a woody taste.

Here is a recipe for 10+ stars:
Double sauce
Omit ginger
Double the cayanne
Replace peanuts with cashews
Make sauce and let chicken marinate for about an hour.
With these changes this is the BEST Thai dish I have ever had!!

This was unbelievable!! The only change I made was doubling the sauce as recommended, next time I may even triple it. The cayenne gives just the right amount of spice. I will definitely be making this again!

great zip in flavor!  I used seasoned rice vinegar instead of wine vinegar (to keep an oriental flair) and added a few cilantro leaves at the end for look and flavor (many Thai dishes use cilantro as an ingredient).  Will make again and again!

THIS WAS AWESOME !!!!! I took the advice of others and tripled the sauce.I used less soy sauce and added a Tablespoon of molasses. I also added about 2-3 tsp of brown sugar (mixed with a little water so it wouldn't lump) and poured on top of chicken mixture last minute ! this is a keeper.

This was sooo yummy! This was better than the Thai peanut dishes that I've had at restaurants. Try using rice wine vinegar if you can. I think that it adds more authentic flavor.

This is a keeper!! I changed a few things, instead of the cayenne pepper I added 1 tsp. of green curry (husband said it was spiced just right!) and instead of broccoli, added thin diced asparagus and cauliflower. I think any vegetable you like will do fine in this recipe. Instead of green onions, I substituted red.  Also added a little more garlic and ginger. This was a fantastic dish! Thanks Jessica!

This was everything I expected it to be. Fantastic, and so quick and easy! Certianly will become a regular for me. Alterations I made include - served with whole wheat noodles instead of rice :: I love PB, so I almost doubled it, had to add a little water to get the right consistency :: used red wine vinegar instead of white.

Fast and easy recipe with loads of flavor!  I used what I had on hand, which was 3 chicken breasts, about 1 cup of broccoli, regular onion instead of green onion, chunky peanut butter, added 1 teaspoon of sugar to the sauce, and used honey roasted peanuts, and the end result was delicious.  Thanks.

This is a very good, versatile recipe.  You can add almost any kind of vegetable; I added whole green beans and a red bell pepper.  It was delicious.  I love that the peanut butter flavor is there, but it isn't overwhelming.

Doubled the sauce but only did 3/4 of the soy sauce and cayenne.  Added sugar.  Cilantro was a good addition.  Shredded carrots would have made the presentation better.

This was a great recipe but I needed more vegetables then just broccoli so I added zucchini, snap peas, celery and white onion (I removed the green onion). It tasted amazing I also used brown rice instead of white rice and I doubled the sauce as many people suggested. And used cashews instead of peanuts. Very good!

Very easy and tasty dish.
Like another reviewer, I added a bit of molasses for sweetness. I also had some red/yellow bell peppers on hand, so I chopped up a couple of cups. And I exchanged red pepper flakes instead of Cayenne because it's what I grabbed. Definitely going to make this again. Thanks!

Quick and easy. Substituted rice wine vinegar for white vinegar, red curry paste for cayenne and broccoli slaw for the broccoli florets.  My 2 year old loves her peanut butter chicken!

I really liked this dish.  We doubled the sauce, and I think we could have even used more.  I also added a red and orange bell pepper.  Served it over jasmine rice.  Oh, and I used rice vinegar rather than white wine vinegar.  YUM!

This was very good.  I doubled the sauce as suggested.  I also served it over thin udon noodles with I lightly stirfried in the pan after I removed the chicken mixture.  Definitely use low sodium soy sauce.

I commend you Jessica on a wonderful dish that my gang truly loved. Due to my daughters peanut allergy, I used her "soy nut butter" and you would not have know the difference. Obviously, I left out the actual peanuts, however, replaced them with sunflower seeds. I also added green and oranges peppers to the mix. Didn't use rice, but asian noodles instead. Fantastic; not to mention, oh so healthy and The McLean family thanks you so very much!!

It is fantastic!  I added some water in the peanut butter sauce to thinner it and bring more juice in the dish.  I also used carrots cooked with chicken as another vegi to this dish.  For broccoli, I steamed it to semi-cooked first and finished cooking with the heat of chicken and carrots (in the wak).

We really enjoyed this recipe.  My husband eats thai food at least 3 times a week... so I found something I can make that he'll enjoy and that is not too spicy for me.  As some of the other reviewers suggested, I doubled the sauce too. Alternative to the sauce ingredients (look at peanut butter noodle recipe) you can add 1 1/2 tbsp honey and hot chile paste instead of cayenne pepper. YUM! Thanks for sharing.

This was good after I made a few adjustments. I tripled the sauce as others suggested, but had to add a whole tsp of pepper and another tablespoon of peanut butter to get rid of the extreme saltiness from the soy sauce. It turned out good, but I was expecting something along the line of Pad Thai, and this sauce was ALOT heavier and not sweet. Cilantro on top before serving is a must. The recipe tasted good, but I probably wont make again, as my family didnt care for it.

Gosh, I normally read reviews before preparing a meal but I didn't here. I wish I had because there was NOT enough sauce! And I added water, too! But the dish was still very good. A bit too much ginger for my taste - I'll greatly reduce that next time. I used Rice vinegar instead of white wine and I added red peppers and sugar snap peas (and cut down on the broccoli.) I think you could make this with spaghetti and dredge the noodles in the sauce, too. We'll make this again.

Very good recipe.  I left the recipe for my husband to make one night and by the time I came home it was made.  I am a big fan of stir fry dishes in general.  This one is really good and I would definitely make it again!

My husband and I loved this recipe! We varied it slightly by doubling the sauce (as others suggested), omitting ginger (I'm not a fan), and halfing the broccoli & adding pea pods.  Will probably add a touch more garlic next time to make up for the lack of ginger, but otherwise it's a real hit with us!

Came out great, I did modify though. I doubled the sauce with a little more than 1/2 tsp cayenne and an extra tbsp of peanut butter. Instead of soy sauce I used an even mix of lite soy and liquid aminos. Doubled ginger as well, used about 1 tbsp crushed garlic and 1/2 tbsp minced garlic. Used about 2.5 cups frozen broccoli florets, thawing but not really cooking them before adding to chicken at the end.  Served over brown rice.  Could probably add another veggie to the mix (bell pepper or carrot?) Next time.  I dont even care if it's totally healthy when all is said and done, it tastes so decadent!

My husband is not the best person to give a dish of Thai,Chiness,or Italian food to so when I made the Thai Peanut Chicken I was very happy when he said it was pretty good. The only change I made was the amounts of Salt and Cyanne Pepper, I put less of both. We don't care for spicy foods so i put less. I don't  use a lot of salt on or in anything so it wasn't missed when i didn't put it in.
This was a great tasting dish and i will make it again but in a smaller quantity.

This was a really easy recipe to make.  I did not add the green onions or the ginger root (not a fan of either).  It was so yummy and a dinner favorite, we will absolutely make it again! If you want it saucy you should double the ingredients for that part.

We really liked this dish. After reading the reviews, I doubled the  sauce. The flavor was a bit soy sauce heavy, I think next time I'll follow the suggestion to add a bit of brown sugar. Definitely will be a next time making this.

I made a lot more peanut sauce. My kid ate the whole thing, and fast!  My wife will eat anything with peanut sauce, so I'd say it was a hit.  I added cumin and some fresh herbs and it turned out really well

I doubled the sauce as per other comments but probably shouldn't have as I found it too rich and much too salty (It could have been because of the natural peanut butter I used). Anyway if I were to make it again I'd probably kick up the heat a bit and use less peanut butter and soy sauce.

I didn't care for the flavor of the chicken or sauce when cooked in this manner. I may have done something incorrectly, which made the chicken dry and bland. The sauce never got very thin...it stuck to the veggies in spots rather than cover them.

It cannot be stressed enough how important it is to double the sauce, for the sauce is the best part. I didn't put in any extra peanuts but I don't feel it took away from the lovely peanut flavor, which combined very well with the cayenne spice and the hint of ginger (I didn't use the full amount). It's terrific, provided you're not allergic to peanuts

I put this in my Recipe Box to make in March 2003.  I finally made this in Jan 2015 and I am so sorry I did not make sooner.  This is really good.  I agree, the sauce needs to be doubled.  You could add anything you like to this very versatile dish.

The ingredients made me try this!!My husband and I really liked the combination of flavors.As others said it could be more saucy.Since I am watching my salt I decided to leave it as is.My husband liked the texture but I might work on it.I also added a pinch of red pepper.We had rice the night before so I decided to mix it with cooked fettuccine.This made a one pot meal!I added a little broth(low salt) to make it easy to combine.

Made it without the peanut butter paste and it was still amazing. Had it on the wok so was able to toss it around without any problems, thank you for the recipe.

We love love love this recipe, and seriously make it every week or two. As per another review, we add a handful of snap peas toward the end. Other changes: Ginger powder instead of fresh, red wine vinegar, natural chunky peanut butter, extra cayenne pepper. We do this with two small chicken breasts and a lot of broccoli. I usually increase the sauce by half, and add a bit of water when I mix it all in to keep it from sticking and help cook all the broccoli. (I skip the oil.) Seriously, though. We love this recipe and never have leftovers!!

I replaced cayenne pepper with red chili powder, used chunky natural peanut butter and added 1/3 cup of Sambal.  Veggie wise, I skipped the broccoli, added asparagus and two medium sized bell peppers.

I thought this recipe was quite simple and easy but needed some instant modifications. Less garlic, more peanut butter and ginger with agave and water for added and needed sweatness and liquid. Overall it was quite tastey and quick. Made it for our quests and tripled the sauce. What made it really awesome and tastier was adding canola oil and cilantra to the jasmin rice as it boiled. Then adding cilantro to the chicken as it was being sauted. The flavors married each other and it was totally awsome. 
Enjoy the recipe and just have fun with it.....:)

This was delicious! I doubled the sauce like other reviewers suggested. I also subbed the brocolli florets with two bags of frozen stir-fry veggies and used minute rice. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This is good.  Kids devoured it, and I will happily have the leftovers for lunch tomorrow.  But I would probably tweak it a bit more or try a different recipe next time.  Following the advice of others, I doubled the sauce so there was some for the rice (but there still wasn't that much).  It was really peanutty - if I make it again, I will scale back a slight bit on the peanut butter and probably add a little chicken broth just to keep the amount of sauce.  i don't think you can put in much more soy sauce, or it will be really salty.

Loved this recipe, thanks for sharing it. The flavors together are amazing! I also used almond butter due to a peanut allergy in the family and maybe  you would enjoy it too. So good, everyone kept saying how much they liked it.I added a touch of chopped cilantro at the end. Update 11/02/15 Note to self use low sodium soy sauce next time!

Yum!! I doubled the sauce, and as we didn't have white wine vinegar, I just used regular vinegar. I also used super chunky peanut butter, and increased the garlic a lot in addition to massively increasing the cayenne pepper as my husband is from India and looooves spice. We used peas instead of broccoli as we didn't have any... delish! Very filling. I will certainly make it again, as it is easy, relatively quick and flexible. Thanks!

Excellent recipe.  I too found it too dry so added about 1/2C water as it was cooking, most of it cooked off, and left a creamy mix, the flavour wasn't compromised at all.  I used light Soy sauce and regular salted peanuts. Lovely.  Will be a regular week night meal, very easy to prepare

I had to make some adjustments to the sauce.  I use Bragg's Liquid Aminos instead of soy sauce, and using 6 TBSP was waay too much, so I had to add a lot more peanut butter.  I also added some agave nectar to give it a sweet touch, and it was perfect.

A little too salty I think. I think I might dilute it with a big of water maybe? I didn't care for the broccoli as much either, I would opt or peas and corn instead. I am going to try this again with the adjustments I mentioned and rate this again =)

I thought this was wonderful, as did my husband and 17 year-old stepson. I did make several changes, on the suggestions of others and based on personal preference. I doubled the sauce and next time I will probably triple it. I strongly recommend not skipping or lessening the fresh ginger as I believe it adds to the complexity of this dish very nicely. I used 4-5 fresh cayenne peppers in place of the powdered variety. I also skipped the green onion all together as I don't care for their consistency and find they generally add little flavor. I was worried the peanut butter would be overwhelming but I thought it was just the perfect amount (I doubled it as mentioned earlier, along with the other wet ingredients). Lastly, I lessened the garlic to 2 tbsp. With these changes, I give this one a five. It was delicious.

I found it a bit too peanut buttery and thick.  I didn't add the onions or peanuts and only used half the amount of chicken called for.  I could barely finish it.

The sauce was very good - I did have to double the amount of sauce when I made it. This makes a lot of food- I didn't pay attention to the amount of servings listed on the recipe - so if you are cooking for a smaller family you may want to cut it in half (but not the sauce). The flavor was very good, but it was not spicy enough for my taste - and I doubled the amount of cayenne pepper. I would make it again, but figure out how to get more heat in it. Thanks for the recipe.

Very, very good! I doubled the sauce, based on other reviews. And I used a bag of frozen Italian veggies (which had zucchini, broccoli, carrots and cauliflower). Served it over noodles instead of rice. So very good!!! Thanks!

I thought this dish was OK, but definitely not what I was hoping for. I took everyone's advice to double the sauce and I used broccoli, green onions, carrots, and sugar snap peas for the vegetables. I also used ground ginger instead of chopped fresh ginger root. I thought the sauce was too salty, but everyone else who tried it liked it. Once it was put over rice it seemed less over-powering. I will definitely try this recipe again, but I may alter the spices to my liking. I like a sweeter sauce, maybe a bit of sugar is all I need to counteract the salty flavor.

I liked this, hubby did not.  He doesn't care for really salty foods...and I love them.  I tripled the sauce which could explain WHY it was so salty (9 tblspoons of soy sauce).  I used rice vinegar. Brown rice.  I will probably not make this again.  Thank You!!

I really liked the sauce. I almost doubled the amount of cayenne because my fiance and I like our Thai pretty spicy.  Super easy and really good!  Be sure to make extra sauce!!

This was a very good and easy recipe.  Although it really needed an extra kick to be thai!  I really like the peanut addition though!

I agree that this is not Thai.  I doubled the sauce (except cayenne), and shouldn't have - too strong!  Maybe I should have stretched the sauce with chicken stock.  My little kids couldn't eat this (and they are not too picky, and usually made to eat whatever is put in front of them!) - my 3 yr old called it yucky chicken.  I definitely won't make again, but gave 3 stars because I didn't follow the recipe exactly.

Really great recipe. Easy to make and full of flavor. Too spicy for me, I'll cut back on the cayenne next time.

Using regular soy sauce combined with the peanut butter makes this exceptionally salty. Other than that, I used two large cloves of garlic, which provided a nice dose of flavor without being overpowering. I also used ground ginger because I didn't have any ginger root on hand. I used a heaping 1/4 tsp of ginger, but it could stand a little more. I only used about 1/8 tsp of cayenne pepper as my husband doesn't like a lot of heat. On my portion, I topped it off with a little sweet hot chili sauce (available at Asian markets) and it was very tasty. Overall, a good recipe.

I followed some of the other reviews which said to double the sauce and I think that might have been a mistake.  The sauce was so overpowering and salty that I just couldn't enjoy the dish in spite of the other good flavors(and we love salt!) I'd like to try making this again because I loved everything else about it, but I wouldn't attempt it unless I was using a low sodium soy sauce and even then I'm not sure it would get rid of the extreme salt taste. Thanks for the recipe.

I didn't read the reviews before trying this recipe and probably should have.  I made the sauce as directed and tasted it and it was way too sour so I added some sugar.  It was still lacking so I added a dash of sesame oil because it goes very well with peanuts.  I then added a chili garlic sauce for the heat and it finally tasted good.  Since I had to make so many modifications this recipe gets 2 stars.

I doubled the sauce like the reviewers said, but it was still kind of bland.  When we added alot of Thai Chili Sweet and Hot sauce, it tasted pretty good.  Won't do this one again.

YUM! I loved this recipe, and will be adding it to my recipe box. I made some small changes due to taste preference, but it would be perfect as written too. I used sugar snap peas instead of broccoli, I doubled the sauce (although it would have been fine without doubling), and I added cilantro on the top as another reviewer suggested because I love the taste of cilantro. Wonderful dinner!

I wavered between 3 and 4 stars.....I figured about a 3.5 and then rounded up.  The recipe definitely needs more sauce for my taste (but I'm sure I put in more broccoli than the recipe called for).  I also thought the sauce was just a bit too vinegary - I'll adjust it next time and maybe even add a bit more spice.  Overall, I'd make it again.

I added red pepper to this for more colour and flavour and I tripled the sauce recipe.  It was very good, though I'm not sure if I would make it again.  It was a nice change.

This was DELICIOUS! :) 5 stars all the way.  I am Asian, but cooked for my "American" boyfriend and it was the perfect balance of flavors for both of us. I doubled the sauce like others suggested and it was perfect. I used 1/4 tsp ginger powder instead, and it was not too "gingery". I also added 1/4 cup water at the end, as when I tasted it, it was slightly salty even though I used low sodium soy sauce. the water evened out the taste perfectly. Will definitely make this again. I ate the leftovers for lunch today and it reheated nicely too. Love the peanut butter flavor! great recipe, i passed it along to a couple others already.

This was delicious and attractive!  It was very salty so I think I will cut down on the soy sauce next time, and probably add some more peanut butter so I can taste it better.  I added red bell pepper and it was great!

I agree with the reviewer that said this was just "okay". The peanut butter didn't mix well with the other liquid ingrediets; adding it directly to the chicken and broccoli made it so there were clumps of peanut butter that weren't evenly distrubuted throughout.

This is going to be a tough review since I didnt measure anything.  But what I did was... 
Did NOT bread or sautee the chicken, just stuck 1/2 frozen chix tenderloins in the 9X11 pan and poured the sauce over and baked about 30 mins.  
The sauce was.. 
3/4'ish cup reduced sodium soy sauce
Cpl Tb. of white vinegar
Splash of white wine (since I was drinking it ...)
Squirt of sesame oil 
Sm. spoonful of Chinese 5 spice (since I had it) Trader Joes btw... 
Sm. spoonful of Hoisin sauce (since I had it)  
Splash of EVOO 
Lg. splash of h20
Cpl'ish Tb. brown sugar 
Shake of cayenne pepper
Simmered and had to add a little corn starch/h20 combo to thicken a bit.. then
I just poured it over and baked.  Served w/ really crispy fresh green beans and it was AWESOME!  I thought it would be too salty since I added more than called for (and it tasted really salty:} BUT after pouring just a little sauce on the chix w/ rice/grn beans it was just perfect! Did I mention the (again spoon full) "Ginger/garlic/green onions"  I added too to the sauce? .. A lot of "G" ingredients did you notice? ** I just noticed, I never even added the peanut butter,, guess its not very "THAI", but how THAI is peanut butter anyway!  It was super yummy!  As usual my kids' friends asked to eat here!  Guess a lot of parents hardly cook.. Cant imagine! Thanks for the great post, and I hope you enjoy your dinner!  * Even easier w/ my tips BTW!

An excellent recipe.  Very little prep time required.  It worked well for me with tripling or quadrupling the sauce (can't have too much sauce!).  Don't be put off if the sauce looks too chunky before the vinegar, it smooths out nicely.  Make sure you use a lot of broccoli.  I also added pineapple chunks (not the juice though) which goes VERY well with the sauce

Very yummy but not very authentic. I made some extra sauce and used chunky peanut butter instead of creamy and adding nuts. I'll make it again but probably alter it some more.

My husband's new favorite!  A few things I did different: Reduced the soy sauce to 2 Tbsp as suggested, used regular vinegar, and added 2 tsp. sweet chili paste in place of the cayenne pepper.  It added a real zing!

Fabulous with some changes.  I doubled the sauce, used regular onion (ran out of green onion), put 2 Tbsp brown sugar and 1 Tbsp white, added a dash of fish sauce and used rice wine vinegar.  Delicious on jasmine rice.  Thanks for the recipe!

This came out fantastic without making many adjustments.  The only changes I made were doubling the sauce (I would still like a bit more), the addition of fresh red & green bell peppers, a bit of brown sugar, and using red wine vineagar (didn't have white wine vinegar).  I used the full 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper and did not find this too spicy.

Very good stir fry.  Quick and easy.  I like to prep the chicken in advance, and let it marinate for a half day in everything except the peanut butter.  Then add the peanut butter as the final stir fry step.
I have even made several batches at the same time and put them in the freezer for home made dinner on a busy night.

I made this dish last night, and I thought it was great! Thanks to other cooks for their invaluable advice on the sauce- the addition of the molasses and brown sugar, sans some of the soy sauce gave a great balanced flavor. I added some water to the peanut/soy mixture to yield more sauce without destroying the flavor or the texture. Not too salty. I love peanut butter so much, so that remained the control variable in this truly versatile dish. 
Another thing, I substituted red wine vinegar for white wine vinegar, and it played wonderfully well with this robust concoction. 

Also, mix in a handful of chopped pineapple, and it gives it even more charm.

My daughter who is 2 didn't like it very much, as she can be picky at times (no brainer :)  but....

I thought it was so awesome. Thanks again!

Awesome! As others have suggested I would actually triple or quadruple the sauce. I used 1/2 the stated amount of soy sauce that the original recipe calls for and added  6 tbsp. of brown sugar to the sauce with tripling the ingredients for the sauce.if you don't triple sauce just add 2 tablespoons of brown sugar.Also used rice vinegar, and sesame oil, instead. Left out the garlic as my  husband hates it. Used only a tbsp of ginger and a little over 1/4 cup of green onions. My husband is the pickiest eater. Thank you, thank you

I was a huge fan but my fiance wasn't (I blame it on a lack of appreciation of Thai food). Definately follow others' advice and at least double the sauce and sub in a tablespoon of molasass for one of soy sauce.

Quite good. I agree that doubling the sauce is best. My husband and I like it spicy so we put in triple the cayenne as well as black pepper and will use more next time. I'd also go a little heavier on the ginger. I added julienned carrots and sliced mushrooms and had it over lettuce and cucumber as a salad but will try it with rice next.

I thought this was great!  Used low-sodium soy sauce and unsalted peanuts and it was not too salty at all.  Decreased the amount of cayenne to 1/8 of tsp. and thought that was plenty.  Will definately be making this again!

My family and I LOVED this recipe. I didn't add the Ginger Root because I didn't have it. I will be making this dish often! The Cayenne Pepper is the perfect amount to give it a little kick, but not too spicy for the ones that don't like spicy! Loved it...thanks!

Excellent blend of spices and crunchies. This was an excellent recipe and very easy to make. The blend of flavors makes it unique and I served it with white Jasmine rice.

This stuff is fabulous!  The only change I would make is double the sauce recipe and maybe thin it out just a touch so that I can coat noodles better with it.  Won't be ordering take-out anytime soon :o)

Great recipe! The fresh ginger was terrific!  Next time I will go lighter on the cayenne, was a bit too spicy for my husband, but it still was great.  I had quite a bit of liquid in my chicken/ginger/garlic stirfry, so I actually drained it (I don't like the idea of all that extra oil/fat and chicken drippings anyhow).  But after I put in the veggies and peanuts, I realized there wasn't enough moisture for the peanut sauce, so I added a couple splashes of water.  Still turned out good, but I wonder if I shouldn't have drained the chicken.

This recipe was great.  I doubled the sauce like others said, and it was perfect.  I only had crunchy peanut butter and that worked fine.  I also only had salted peanuts, so it came out a little salty, but it was fine once it was over rice.  Definitely an easy, special treat for me and and my husband!

This recipe is quick and easy and tastes great! However, I'm speaking of my modified version -- I can't do spicy, so I left out the cayenne pepper and onions. I used low-sodium soy sauce, crunchy peanut butter, and red wine vinegar (store didn't have white wine vinegar). I tripled the peanut sauce, and it was *just* enough to coat everything; next time I'll try *quadrupling* it -- better too much than too little. Adding carrots and water chestnuts might be good too, maybe try serving it over rice cooked in chicken broth for more mix of flavors.

This is delicious!  Not too hot but does have some zip to it!  For two servings, I added about 8 ounces of chicken broth with about a tablespoon of cornstarch to it.  Next time I think I'll had some bok choy.  I had chunky peanut butter and it works fine.

We made this for company for the first time and took all of the suggestions from the comments from others.  We quadrupled the peanut sauce receipe and added alot more broccoli.  It was fast and easy.  Probably the best receipe I've ever made!  It is pretty hot though one of our guest was sweatting.  Great flavor and restaurant quality don't pass this receipe up!

My husband said this is one of the best dishes I've ever made.  I thought it was pretty good, but I didn't like it quite as much as he did.  Next time, I will use a lot more broccoli, double the sauce, and add some black pepper.  I used natural peanut butter, and will do so again next time.  It could have used a bit more Cayenne as well, even for me, and I usually can't handle things too spicy.  Overall, a great dish, just need to make a few adjustments next time.

I was very excited to try this recipe as my husband and I love Thai food. But I have to say this was not Thai at all. I followed the recipe exactly and it was way salty and tasted only like peanut butter. I will not be making this again. If you do make this make sure to use low sodium soy sauce and less of it.

Doubled the sauce, served with brown aromatic rice.  Also, used natural peanut butter so it was more savory than if I had used commercial p/b.  Very good.  Added a lot more broccoli.

I thought it would be too strong to double the sauce, so I added about 1/3 cup chicken broth at the same time I added the broccoli.  That helped steam the broccoli and made more sauce.  I then added some cornstarch disolved in water to thicken the sauce before serving.  It was a huge hit and will now be a regular on our table.

I used tofu instead of the chicken.  Lately I have been using tofu because of ease.  Tasted awesome!  Must double or triple sauce and I like to add water chestnuts for a little more crunch.

This was not very good.  It lacked flavor; the sauce was thin.  Will not make again.

Very good!  I doubled the sauce, but probably should have tripled.  The broccoli soaked up the sauce and was delicious, but the chicken didn't absorb it as well.  I may try it with tofu next time since tofu seems to absorb sauces well.  Thanks Jessica!

I'm sorry to say that after craving this dish for days and following the recipe carefully, this dish disappointed my Thai-loving hubby and I. And we have loved this dish at restaurants in the past! The sauce was too sticky and lacked the spice we were hoping for :(

This was a very tasty dish!  As other reviewers have recommended, double the sauce or you'll be disappointed. I doubled the sauce and I thought it was *just the right amount* to accompany the chicken and broccoli. I can't imagine what this recipe would taste like with the amount of sauce that the original recipe provides for...probably bland. This is one dish that I will make again and again (with sauce doubled).  Thumbs up!

VERY GOOD! And it uses most things you have on hand. I didn't have white wine vinegar, so I used half wine I had on hand and half plain vinegar. Very nice flavour!

Since no one is commenting on how salty the peanut sauce is, I can only assume I grossly mismeasured the amount of soy sauce I was using.  It was still a great recipe, even with that hiccup.

I love the flavor of the sauce in this recipe. My only caveat is, after reading many reviews that repeated the idea that the proportions in the recipe did not make enough sauce, I decided to "go rogue". This may not work for those that strictly follow recipes, but I actually eyeballed my proportions for the sauce and it turned out excellently. I added about a quarter of a jar of crunchy peanut butter and used white wine since I do not have white wine vinegar, and put a half of a large container of chicken and olive oil on high heat with the soy sauce and cayenne pepper to melt it down. Again, it felt a little harder to make this way, but it ensured that I had a lot of extra sauce and I think the broth and adding extra peanut butter also made the spice tasty but not painful. I added a squeeze of lime to each plate right before serving as also recommended by other reviewers, which I think gave it a pad thai type of taste. It was wonderful!

I made double the sauce and added a little extra peanut butter. Way too salty! If I make this again I’ll cut the soy sauce in half.

I did the recipe as it was written, which I always do before making changes. It just didn't have any pizzaz (despite the cayenne), and I'm not really sure how to change that. One thing might be less ginger, but I won't be making it again, since there are lots of other good ways to stir-fry chicken.

Loved the recipe. Rally good taste.  Used pea pods but be careful not to overcook.  Could have used a bit more sauce.  Used 3 chicken half breasts - seemed like enough.  Next time, I'll add water chestnuts and mushrooms (like shiitake)

I didn't have white wine vinegar, so I used rice wine vinegar instead, and used low sodium soy.  It was delicious. My husband said it was one of the best things I have ever made! It was also really easy!  Will definitely make this again!!

I made one change, and that was the rice, instead of the rice noodles were used instead. for me when you think of thai , you think of noodles, for some reason it goes better. would I make it again for sure, but would try adding more ingrediants more veggies. such as snow peas and maybe some peppers.

Made this tonight and it was great.  As others suggested. I doubled the sauce but not the peanut butter.  Used chunky and also used honey roasted peanuts.  Thanks to the reviewer who added juice of a lime & brown sugar.  Only added 1 T of the brown sugar since I was using honey roasted peanuts.  I didn't want to buy rice vinegar for just this recipe and used just white wine.  Will definitely make again, but the prep doesn't make this a fast meal for most nights.  I'd been wanting to try this but I needed to wait for a time when I could do all the prep the day before.  Added toasted sesame seeds sprinkled on top.  Next time I will look to have rice noodle on hand as I think that would taste super.  I intended to take a photo but it looked so good and we were hungry so I forgot.

I'm not sure what makes this "Thai."  It's tasty and easy to make, but nothing special.  I doubled the sauce, but I felt it could have used more.  Even using the low sodium soy sauce, it's still salty.  I added extra garlic and ginger, some red peppers for color and a few snow peas.   I think should I make this another time, I'll experiment more, add more ginger and steam the broccoli before -hand so that I can just toss it in.

So easy to make! I printed this recipe out to keep in our permanent binder of favorite dinners. We used bell peppers instead of broccoli because my hubby doesnt like it. I think you could put any kind of veggies with this recipe.

My husband made it.It was delicious.He did say he cooked the chicken ,broccoli & rice longer. But he used brown rice because we had some & it is a more complex carbohydrate.  .Also, recipe calls for way more rice than two people can eat.
But it was very good & we well eat it again.

This was a great recipe. As per usual I read the comments prior to cooking, I doubled the sauce recipe (but not the peanut butter, only an extra third and I'm a peanut butter lover). I also added more spice. Lastly I cooked noodles not rice so made this entire reciepe much quicker. I've made this with chicken and pork and prefer pork. Thanks for ththe recipe.

It was good, but I think would benefit from some red bell pepper or carrots for color and texture. Will make again with those additions. I also doubled the sauce ingredients for our preference.

My family said: "You can make that again next week, if you'd like".  So- that rates 5 stars.  I used brown rice, not white, and low sodium soy sauce. I had very little fresh ginger on hand, added some ground ginger.  It was fine. Glad to have a tasty chicken recipe, as chicken and ground turkey are our go-to meats.

I used boneless skinless chicken thighs, added mushrooms and used asparagus since I didn’t have broccoli.  This being said, I made the sauce as directed.  Hubby and I liked it very much and I will make this again.

There was WAY too much rice for 4 servings.  1 cup of uncooked rice in 2 cups of water would have been plenty!!
There wasn't enough sauce and overall it was VERY dry.  Followed the recipe exactly and would have been MUCH better if it would have had 1/2 c chicken broth in the sauce or even double the peanut sauce.  Overall, very disappointing.  Not sure I would make this again.

I made this.  It needs a sweetener.  I noticed that someone stated that they tripled the recipe, added some lime and 2-3 T of brown sugar.  I'm going to try it again with that and add some cilantro.  Good but needs a little modification.

This was a good dish, and I liked the flavor of the sauce.  I made it according to instructions, although I did not have quite as much chicken on hand as the recipe called for.  I agree with others that there was not enough sauce.  I was afraid the broccoli would dry out, so I added maybe a cup of water so that it would cook better, then let that thicken, and it worked OK.  I thought the ginger was a bit overpowering.  I think next time I might  add more garlic, substitute snow peas or edamame for the broccoli, and try chicken thighs instead of breast meat.  Also, I made only half the rice and it was plenty.

Made an excellent filling for home made burger buns or hot dog rolls instead of burger patties. I tried this because my son can't eat rice & Friday night is burger night.

I made this per the recipe and it turned out great. The only thing I would do next time is add more cayenne pepper, I used slightly more than the recipe calls for and it still didn’t have enough bite for a Thai dish.
I will make this again.

I am an old cook, but new to these ingredients. I pretty much did everything as written. My husband and I really enjoyed it. Different from what we usually eat. I added roasted broccoli, red and green peppers. So good. My only thought, especially if you are new, like me, save some pasta water in case your sauce needs thinning.

I really liked this. Made it as described.  Used a rice cooker to make it easier, since it seemed like 3 cups would be enough. It was, and I had rice left over.  Used more of all the spices since that is my  personal taste. 

 The only actual change I made, is that I like my sauces to be a bit thicker. I use tapioca starch, which is just a box of regular tapioca put through a coffee grinder.  Works like cornstarch,  but I recall that it goes better with oriental dishes.  A bit of a sprinkle of that, and two or three more minutes simmering, and it was perfect.    

I also liked that the ginger was chopped and not grated, so there was more of a taste to it.

 All in all, a great recipe, and I will definitely make it again.

Super easy! I was out of soy sauce so I used worchester sauce.  I also added just a little more peanut butter, a little honey and a bit more cayenne pepper. It was delicious!

We really enjoyed this one....just a few minor changes we will try. Like adding more sauce, broccoli, and mushrooms.

I made two substitutions that I think worked out great: swap in asparagus for broccoli and add red bell peppers. This dish was delicious!

Well... I doubled the sauce as suggested by almost every other review... but still didn't find it very satay-esqu. I added a bit of lime juice for acid and subbed a few veg cause why not?

I did make some changes.  I omitted the garlic (husband can't eat it anymore), doubled the sauce, omitted the green onions  (didn't have any) and added some yellow and red bell peppers and celery in addition to the broccoli.  It was a hit!  My family loved it. will make again!  Thanks for the recipe.

Authentic or no, I thought it was great for being so easy and simple. However, I used chicken thighs;  didn't have green onions so used  a little less of regular onion, about half as much (fresh) ginger -- doubled everything else (for the sauce) and added about 2-3 TBS brown sugar. I couldn't imagine this without a semi-sweetened sauce and I'm sure I prefer it that way. Will definitely make it again.

Like others, I doubled the sauce. I also quadrupled the cayenne. I also added red pepper. This was terrific...but I'd add more veggies. I'll definitely make this again.

I found this not "peanutty" enough and would add more. The roasted peanuts were not salted, and we go light on salt, but that may take some flavor away.  I threw in a TB or so of coconut.  Would make this again tweaking spices to add a bit more full flavor.

I loved this but made a few changes! I doubled the sauce and substituted the peanuts and creamy peanut butter for chunky peanut butter. I also added 3/4 cup of coconut milk, and added extra cayenne to counteract the sweetness. I added a red pepper in as well, and would recommend adding any other stir-fry vegetables you may enjoy.

I made extra sauce too.  Added more vegetables. Not the best, not the worst.  I would add coconut milk and honey to help the taste.

I took everyone's advice & doubled the sauce.  Otherwise, followed the recipe.  I really liked it, but my husband didn't (& rarely will he not eat my dinners).  He thought it too peanut butter tasting.  Still a very good recipe I thought.  Thanks for sharing!

I am confused by this recipe--the one in the magazine calls for 1/2 cup chicken broth to be mixed with the soy sauce, peanut butter vinegar and cayenne.  I made the magazine version tonight for dinner.  I assume this recipe is wrong and omitted it??

This was pretty easy to make, loved the taste, and made some potstickers to go along with it. Was enough for four people plus a toddler. I will make this again. Halved the cayenne pepper.

I am in the process of making this recipe after seeing it in the Allrecipes magazine.  I went to the Allrecipes site and printed it out.  I notice that the recipe in the magazine uses chicken broth in the peanut/soy mixture but the recipe in the site does not.  NIMITZ submitted it and I was wondering if the chicken broth was accidentally left out or if the magazine took the liberty of adding it.  I added the chicken broth as per the magazine.
     My family enjoyed this dish very much.  I did as other reviewers suggested and doubled the soy/peanut sauce and was glad I did.  I would serve  this again and try adding more veggies like carrots, mushrooms, pea pods or whatever else appeals to you.  It satisfies that Thai craving nicely!

My husband and I LOVED this - it was easy to make and tasted great.  I also increased the peanut sauce (I actually quadrupled it, so that we would have lots of peanut sauce - glad I did).  I used basmati rice rather than white rice and it was really delicious with the chicken/sauce.  This will be a regular dish in our house! (And I don't like things really spicy, so I was worried about the cayenne, but it actually wasn't too spicy (though there is a little kick).

I made some minor adjustments according to my family's tastes, but essentially stuck to the original recipe. I did a tablespoon less of both the garlic and ginger, yet added about 1/4 tsp of crushed red pepper and also included about 1 cup of additional broccoli. Delicious!

I've made this several times for my wife and I. We've enjoyed it while also making my own tweaks.  Shrimp instead of chicken, mushrooms and water chestnuts. No cayenne but substituted it with red chili peppers (chopped) or used sirachia sauce. Very easy and quick delicious meal.

Fantastic recipe!  I made it for my brother and sister in law and they thought it was fantastic as well. My brother cleared his plate and he usually hates broccoli.

I thought this recipe was good. I made it as directed but would have liked more sauce. Next time I'll double the recipe as others suggested.

I made 4x the sauce, and added 1 tsp sugar. I didn't have green onions, so I coated the chicken in onion powder. Also, I used chunky peanut butter, and just left out the peanuts. I cooked the chicken with a bit more soy sauce. Best thing I ever ate!!! Thank you for this simple recipe!

This was delicious!   I ended uo doubling the recipe and putting in a little more peanut butter.  I also substituted yellow pepper for the broccoli.  I put in maybe 1/5 of the garlic it called for as i was using minced garlic from a jar. Great meal will definitely make again!

One word...Delicious!. I really liked how easy it was to make. I followed the suggestions of past reviewers and doubled the sauce. I used garlic and ginger paste, since i didn't have fresh garlic or ginger.Also, i used turkey strips in place of chicken(that's what i had at the time), cashew nuts in place of peanuts and a squeeze of lemon juice in place of wine vinegar.And yes, i also followed a suggestion from another reviewer(thank you, mommaof4!), and added some sugar for that touch of sweetness. Next time, i'll go grocery shopping to make sure i have all the right ingredients on hand:). But all in all, it turned out absolutely great. I'm definitely making this again...really soon:) - fj28

This was good.  I sliced up thin cut chicken breast.  I doubled the sauce.  Used 6 cloves of garlic and 1 tbs ground ginger.  I would use fresh ginger next time.  I used 3/4 cup chunky peanut butter.  I cooked the chicken with the garlic and ginger in a little olive oil in the wok.  I added the peanut sauce.  I also added 1 tsp garlic chili sauce for a kick.  I added some water to thin the sauce and cooked till sauce looked ready.  Served over angel hair pasta.  It tasted like the noodles from the Chinese restaurant.  Would make again.

Was excellent. I mixed my rice with the end product, and I added a tad more spice, because I like spicy food. Red pepper flakes work well, or if you just like hot sauce, go for it in the peanut butter sauce. Extra veggies are great too.

DEEEEE-LISH! Instead of serving over rice, I tossed it with about 6 oz. vermicelli because I was in the mood for noodles. LOVED it. The entire family (kiddos included) devoured this! So easy, so fast, SO TASTY! Thanks:)

This was outstanding!  I used a frozen stir fry vegetable mix, but defrosted the veggies first before I added them to the chicken.  The sauce is wonderful and has the perfect amount of spicyness to give it some flare.  Yum!

This was very good!  My husband eats so much peanut butter so of course he loved it!  I did double the sauce.  And we used a teaspoon of ground ginger instead of fresh ginger root.  We also didn't have green onions, we added carrots and snap peas.  And used only 1 tablespoon of minced garlic because that's what we had. We also added some frozen yellow/red/green bell peppers that we had from Trader Joes.  If you use those, don't add until the end they get soggy a bit!  I spend a lot of time managing Diabetes patients, so in a prevention effort I left out the rice.  It's great on it's own!

I've never made peanut chicken and I thought this was quick, easy and good.  A couple of changes: I used red wine vinegar instead of white, mixed veggies, and ginger powder.

I made this for the first time the other day and although I usually refer to recipes for more of a guideline than an instruction manual this one is pretty spot on. Only alterations for the first time around were rice wine vinegar instead of white and omitting the ginger root (not my favorite flavor). We used brown rice as well. It turned out surprisingly well and was extremely easy to make. Will defiantly make this again, especially on week nights when time is short.

LOVED THIS... but made some modifications.   I doubled the sauce as recommended in other reviews. I also substituted rice vinegar for the white wine vinegar and added crushed red pepper flakes to boost up the heat.  I don't care for ginger so I left it out completely.  I cooked the chicken almost completely and then removed it and placed it on a plate with an aluminum foil tent to allow it to keep cooking in its own juices.  Then I added the broccoli, some red bell pepper, double the scallions, carrots and water chestnuts... cooking until the broccoli and carrots were just softened.  Then I added the chicken and all the juices that collected back to the pan, added the sauce mixture and simmered for just a minute or two to bring all the flavors together.   It was WONDERFUL!!!  Will definitely make this again!!!!

Doubled the sauce like others suggested and added a little water to thin just a bit (my sauce was really thick with the peanut butter but I used fresh ground peanuts which may have altered the texture).  Added like others said, more garlic (4-5 cloves), handful of chopped cilantro, omitted the peanuts since the sauce was peanutee enough, added 1-1/2 Tbsp. Mirin (sweetened sake found in Asian section) and served with lime slices and extra hot garlic-chili sauce and this was a 5 star.

This was kind of bland.   I also thought it was a little dry.  I served it over thai noodles instead of rice but I do not think that made a diffrence. I will not make this again.

I love this recipe.  I made a few modifications - I tripled the sauce and used liquid aminos instead of soy sauce.  I replaced white wine vinegar with rice vinegar.  Then I  added a 1/4 cup brown sugar,  and an entire can of coconut milk, and a tbsp of caridander instead of ginger.  It was fabUlicious!

I tried to make this as written, but I tasted the sauce after mixing and it was way too salty (even after using low sodium soy sauce). I could also tell just by looking at it that there wasn`t going to be enough sauce. So, I doubled the sauce and added about 1 tbs molasses and little bit of brown sugar. There was just enough sauce and it tasted wonderful. I will make this again with the changes I just noted.

The other reviews were right on the money.  It was way too salty.  I doubled the sauce and added about a 1/2 cup brown sugar to it (and some water).  It turned out fantastic.  I also added green peppers.  I will definitely be making this again!

This was really good. I loved the slightly spicy flavor of the cayenne with the peanut butter. Maybe I used smaller chicken breasts, but this made maybe 4 servings, not 8. If you're expecting to serve 8 people, I'd double the recipe.

Sauce was bland when made as stated. I added 1/3 brown sugar and a teaspoon or two of sesame oil.  As per other reviews, I made enough rice and chicken for the three of us, and left the rest of the quanities the same.  Pretty good when played with a bit.  A good starting place for a great chicken recipe.

I accidentally added an extra tablespoon of peanut butter, which is why the sauce tasted way too peanutty.  I halved the cayenne for my kids, but next time would up it a bit because I couldn't taste any spice at all.  This was pretty bland but I'll make it again and try cutting the pb and adding more cayenne.  Also, I added fresh garlic, but just used ginger powder since that's all I had on hand.  I will also add a bit of sugar like someone else suggested, I think this dish could use a little sweetness...or maybe a twist of fresh o.j.???

Overall, not bad, but it definitely needs adjustments.  I doubled the sauce, as almost everyone else said, and I might even triple it next time, and also decreased the amount of garlic and ginger.  My biggest problem was even with low-sodium soy sauce, it was WAY too salty.  I would prefer for the sauce to be sweeter, so I'm going to try to substitute at least 1 TB of the soy sauce for brown sugar and water next time.  With a few alterations, this could be a great dish.

I gave this recipe a four, only because I altered it, and then it is a five :) I made my peanut sauce with 3 tablespoons soysauce, 3 tablespoons peanut butter (I love peanut butter), 2 teaspoons rice vinegar, 1/4 teaspoon chili pepper (I didn't have cayenne and didn't feel like buying it just for this recipe), 1 teaspoon ground ginger, 1-2 tablespoons honey (i felt like the sauce needed a bit of sweetness), and 1/2tsp of red pepper flakes (to taste). Also, I saw that they put red peppers in the picture, but not in the recipe, so I included these. I used only two chicken breasts, and it seemed like one batch of sauce was enough for that, so i could see if you were making it with 4, you would need more sauce.   I'm making it again tonight, and am quite excited - yum!

This was a great dish!  I routinely use Peanut Satay in a jar for peanut chicken and this was much better.  I served it with jasmine rice and added a can of coconut milk to make more of the sauce.  My entire family loved it!

This recipe is really good.  The sauce is perfect.  Not too spicy but just right.  I made a double batch of sauce so there was extra to pour over the rice.  Thanks!

I am in college and am oversees studying with some fellow classmates. We all were craving some Thai Peanut Chicken and this more than hit the spot! Just a couple of tips. If you are living in Europe then you may need to add sugar to the sauce as Peanut butter over here is not a sweet as American, its more like natural peanut butter. Also doubled the sauce and chicken, it seemed like there just wasn't enough as i was cooking so if you like more sauce then double for sure. As for the chicken i have three hungry college boys to feed so we needed as much meat as we could get! It seriously was the best...try it!

This was a pretty good recipe.  I changed it a bit, though.  Instead of broccoli, I used shredded carrots and sliced bell peppers.  I also doubled the sauce and added between 1/4 and 1/2 C. chicken broth.  I also added some cilantro near the end of cooking.  Overall, a good recipe :)

This was really a wonderful recipe.  My husband said that he would eat this every night!  I used regular white vinegar and added a tablespoon of white wine.  I omitted the onions, and used 1 1/2 teaspoons powdered ginger instead of fresh ginger root.  Also added some sliced carrots.  This will become a "regular" in our house.

LOVE THIS RECIPE! It tastes like it came out of a restaurant. It's spicy for sure, but it's delicious. I don't like spice as much as my husband so I might not put quite as much of the pepper in as it called for. It's probably a recipe that we'll make at least once a month if not more!

I have been holding on to this recipe for weeks now & now I ask myself, "WHY!" Excellent flavors. The only thing I did differently was omit the green onions (not a big fan), use brown rice instead of white, add 1 tbsp sugar to the peanut butter mixture to balance the heat, add sliced carrots & 1/2 thinly sliced red pepper.....I always try to disguise veggies for the kids. This recipe is "cake." Your family will love it as did mine!

Can I give this 6 stars?? This is like, the best thing I've ever put in my mouth. My boyfriend and I "love" it, if you know what I mean! We added extra garlic, and vinegar to the chicken when cooking it-gives it that extra pizzaz everyone is looking for.

Definitely double the sauce. I used a natural peanut butter, and had to thin it down with some water. I served the broccoli on the side. I attempted to use a Japanese somen noodle but they turned to glue, so then I had to use the brown rice at the last minute. I did not think this was spicy at all so I am wondering if I need new cayenne pepper. My kids did not like this at all. I think it was too rich for them.

The peanut butter taste did not stand out, the garlic was too strong and had to be cut down.  With a few changes it was a pretty good meal.

Was excellent!! I love peanuts in my stir fry...and making the extra "sauce" is a definite!! Put a bunch of fresh veggies (snow peas, yellow and orange peppers, broccoli) and its great over rice! Will definitly make again!

Excellent recipe.  Not overpowering peanut taste. I used shrimp in place of chicken.  I made it for someone who was unsure about the dish and they loved it! Will definitely make again.

I thought this was very good.  I doubled the sauce, used 1 tsp. of ground ginger and added extra broccoli and peanuts.  It was fairly easy to put together.

This was very good!  My only problem was that it was too salty, so I decreased the soy sauce and increased the peanut butter, (I use Organic).  I also increased the broccoli the second time around.  Next time I think I will add a variety of veggies, but the basis for this recipe is nice!

After thouroughly researching the reviews, I decided to give this a try.  Even though I halved the recipe, I did follow the ingredient list and instructions.  We were disappointed in this dish.  It was too "peanut buttery" for our liking.  It wasn't bad, it just wasn't great.  Thanks for the recipe anyhow!

Super yummy!  The only thing I did different, was omit the ginger.  I didn't have any, but the recipe still turned out delicious!  Had to use a whisk to get the peanut butter to blend, but that worked perfectly.  Very good!  Husband raved about it!

My husband and I love this recipe! I make it for just the two of us, cutting the amount of chicken in half but leaving everything else the same. We like the sauce and this seems to make just enough for us. If you were making for a group I'd make more sauce.

Very easy and fast, good but seemed to be missing something.  I added onion, carrot and celery, also doubled the sauce and used 2 chicken breasts.  I might make again because it's so quick and easy.

I am new to the Thai cooking, and this was my first attempt.  This was such a tasty dish and my husband liked it as well.  Next time though, I think I will make a little extra sauce (for leftover reheating).  I will probably add more green onions as well.  MMMMM-good!

This dish cooked up well when I doubled the sauce like so many here had suggested. I also made this with shrimp instead of chicken and used a bag of frozen stir-fry veggies with extra carrots and green pepper thrown in. Used green onion, although not as much as called for. Yummy!! Next time I might add more peanut butter so that flavor would really shine...had something similar to this on vacation in Honduras and LOVED it!!

This is probably not a fair review because I didn't follow the recipe. I doubled the sauce because I read in the reviews that that was the thing to do. WHAT A MISTAKE! It was SO rich with double the sauce! It might have been ok if I followed the recipe.

I really liked this recipe, but I made some changes. i didnt think the ginger was well represented so I added more and doubled the cayenne pepper. I also thinned out the sauce to be less peanut buttery. Overall, my girlfriend and I loved it.

I was very excited to try this out since I love peanut butter. It was so so. My boyfriend loved it, but I feel it was lacking something. I ended up tripling the sauce as suggested (you have to of there eill not be enough), adding in chili pepper flakes, throwing in a bag of frozen veggies, and upping the vinegar. It was wonderful for a quick 20 minute meal but I wish I could figure out what was missing. Also, cilantro is a must. Great for a quick meal but it just didn't hit the spot.

I thought it was really good. I thought it was quite hot but the rest of it was great. For the people reading this, I would really reccomend trying it! My family didn't mind it but I loved it, because it's nice and healthy. But make sure you dont put to much chilli because it really burns. So give it a try, it's quite tasty! I would make it again.
Lachlan has reviewed this recipe as part of his studies on Indonesian Culture for his primary school. Well done Lachlan on your forward thinking!

I was not that impressed with this recipe. We get really good, authentic thai in this country and it just tasted like an american's version of a thai dish.

Just OK for our family, a little runny and not an authentic "thai" dish that I expected. I will not make this again.

YUM! I use half the amount of chicken and add carrots, zuchinni, yellow squash and broccoli and this is one of my favorite recipes. Easy and delicious!

I made this for a large dinnner party 20+ people -- everyone enjoyed it and I put it together several hours before hand. It held up nicely -- I served the rice separately.

Wow - absolutely fantastic! One of the best that I have had - thanks so much for sharing! UPDATE - We have made this numerous times and it is better each and every time! We double the sauce. Don't triple - too much.

Very good!  I used less olive oil and added a sliced red bell pepper to the recipe.  I think that cutting the chicken into small 1 inch pieces is better, the bigger pieces tend to dry out a little bit.  I will be making this again.  Thanks.

This was so tasty, and very simple to make. The peanutbutter smell was a bit overwhelming at first, so I diluted it with 1/4 cup of water. I also added 1/2 cup sweet pepper, 1 stalk of scallion, and 1 teaspoon of curry. This balanced the aroma of the dish.

So delicious - my stepson said it was the best stirfry he ever had! I doubled the sauce because I added a yellow pepper for colour and a little bit more chicken. Next time I would add a bit more cayenne as this barely had a hint of spice ... and we like it hot! This we will definitely make again!

I love peanut sauce, I love broccoli, and I’m always on the lookout for a good weekday chicken meal, so when I found this recipe it looked like it was perfect. Sadly, this just didn’t do it for me. It didn’t have enough peanut flavor (despite the fact that I increased the dry-roasted peanuts to ½ cup) and the cayenne overpowered the other spices, so that I could hardly taste the ginger.  On the whole it was fine, but just not that good. I won’t make it again.

I'm glad I read the reviews- I tripled the sauce except for the cayenne. (used less) It was a bit thick, so I added more seasoned rice vinegar & a little water. Used a 1 lb bag of frozen carrots, broccoli, & cauliflower- defrosted with hot water in a colander. Served over brown rice. Lots of calories, but healthy ones! I think next time I will tone down the ginger a bit & chop the peanuts. ALWAYS use low sodium soy sauce! Yummy- try this!

I tripled the sauce and used a little less ginger. Lets just say, they are VERY happy we are getting married!

Wow this was salty. I started with less soy sauce (used 1 1/2T instead of 3T) and used the low-sodium kind and it still knocked me over. Liked the ginger/peanut flavor, but probably won't make again.

This was really wonderful.  I cut the chicken ingredients in half as there were only two of us.  I left the sauce recipe as is, however, and was glad that I did.  Would not have had enough sauce if I had cut that in half as well.  I also added a bit of molasses to the sauce as I felt it needed a bit more sweetness.  Also added a splash of sesame oil to the sauce for flavor.  Will definately do both again when I make it again.

We really enjoyed this one.  It's a little on the salty side so I'll use a low sodium soy-sauce next time.  We loved the flavor of the peanut butter and the added crunch of the nuts. I followed other reviewers' suggestions and doubled the sauce. I also threw in some red bell pepper. So delicious!

This was good--with a few changes.  I used a frozen bag of stirfry veggies and stirred in after heating in the microwave...Also--if you like spicy foods, you need more red pepper & definitely more ginger.  Also subbed sesame oil and used some thai garlic chili sauce...V. good!  Tasted just like restaurant quality.  Served with basmati rice.  Will definitely make again.

Good recipe!  I used tofu and shrimp instead of chicken and sauted them with the garlic and ginger.  I also added asian chili paste instead of cayenne.  Definitely double the sauce as suggested by previous reviewers.  I'll certainly make this again.

Not a big fan at all. I followed the recipe exactly, and the taste was too peanut buttery, and I don't think it went well with rice.

I just finished making this recipe and thought it was great.  I changed a couple of things.  I added carrots, and replaced the peanuts with sunflower seeds.  The sauce, as per the reviews, I doubled, then added about 1/4 cup of water.  I tend to use this sauce as a base for stir frys from now on.  I really liked the subtle flavour of the peanut butter.

This was far too salty, even after cutting the soy sauce in half.  Salt was the dominating taste, I couldn't taste the garlic, ginger or cayenne (or chicken for that matter).

Very good but I changed it up a bit. I used rice vingegar instead of white wine vinegar. The sauce was not "saucy" enough, so I added about 1-2 more tablespoons of peanut butter. It needed something else so I added some chili sauce and it was wonderful. I also used peanut oil instead of olive oil, since it is peanut chicken.

This is really good. I didn't have fresh ginger root or white wine vinegar. I substituted ground ginger and rice vinegar. The dish turned out good and my family enjoyed it. I will make this again with fresh gingerroot next time.

Really Good!  Used purchased red curry paste instead of cayenne.  When I made the sauce I added all ind. expect soy sauce, tasted it and added soy sauce to taste, 3 T would have been WAY too salty for our family's taste, or if your watching salt intake since the p.b. has salt in it already.

My husband is a big fan of spicy food, and since I had little experience in that department I looked up this recipe and tried it out. He loves it! Only one downside, I've found that the sauce can sometimes be a little too dry.

We loved this recipe!  I used tofu instead of chicken because I have been trying to add more soy to our diet.  I also used rice vinegar instead of white wine vinegar.

It was good, but a little too salty (even with the low sodium soy sauce).  I'm still looking for a chicken and peanut sauce dish, that isn't too peanut buttery.

My husband and I really loved this recipe.
I did triple the sauce, and I added a head of chinese napa cabbage.
It had a very good flavor.
I will definitely be making this one again!!!
It was just spicy enough!

This was so easy and definitely was ready in less than 40 minutes.  It's faster if you cook the rice at the same time as everything else.  I love peanuts so I threw in an extra handful.  The dish could have been a little spicier even, so I may up the cayenne a little next time.  Lucky for me I bought extra ingredients and I'll be making this again very soon!!

Thanks heaps! Was very good. Did (approximetely) triple the sauce, i put the peanuts in a baggie and crushed them to make them more integrated into the recipe, and just used white vinegar instead of white wine. My family ate it though (even said it was good) and they aren't usually very experimental ( I chose this off this website instead of something more ethnic)... will make again, very simple and fun even to make!

Hubby says that this is a DEFINITE re-make.  I used 8 oz. of chicken to make 2 serving.  Made the whole amount of sauce, onions, and peanuts for the 2 of us, but did decrease the garlic to 1 Tbs., the gingerroot to 1/2 Tbs., and the broccoli to about 2-1/4 cups.  Didn't have any white wine vinegar, so I used 1 tsp. of each red wine vinegar and dry white wine.  Also used rinsed honey-roasted peanuts in lieu of the dry-roasted.  This recipe made more sauce than we could use, but better too much than too little.  It may not have been too much sauce if I had made the rice.  I chose to serve it with mashed potatoes.  This was REALLY GOOD!!!

This was alright.  I did modify it, but the peanut butter was still too thick and overwhelming.  It was also very salty!  I've had better thai peanut chicken with a more complex flavor.

This recipe was tasty but dry.  The sauce needs to be thicker in order to coat the ingredients.  Try adding a little cornstarch to the peanut butter mixture, or maybe just add more peanut butter.

I was a bit dissapointed, it seemed flavorless. I substituted almonds for peanuts and used chicken thighs and it was still pretty bland. I won't be making this one again. Hopefully I can add some flavor to the leftovers.

This was ok.  I forgot to buy peanuts and I think they would have added alot to the dish.  I added soy sauce to give it more taste.  I loved the broccoli and chichen mix, however.  I think next time I will make sure I have peanuts!

This recipe got a "good" rating from my husband, so I know it's a keeper!  I agree with everyone who said to double the sauce.  I only used half the chicken and still ended up wishing there was more sauce, as it came out rather pasty.  Still the flavor was good.  Not authentic Thai by a long shot, but still a nice, relatively quick and tasty meal.

I used sugar snap peas instead of broccoli because that's what I had on hand.  I also used natural peanut butter, but I think I'll use chunky instead of creamy next time.  Nice flavor, but I highly recommend tripling the sauce recipe.  Other than that, it was very good.

This was very good.  My husband very much enjoyed it, probably more than I did.  This was just slightly spicy, but sometimes that is even too much for me.  I decreased the amount of garlic to 2 tablespoons and that seemed just right.  I'll make this again.

What great flavor!  This is a recipe you can improvise with so easily without altering the dish because it is the sauce that makes it!  I used ground ginger instead of fresh, omitted the green onions and substituted different veggies to utilize what I had on hand.  It was terrific nonetheless.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  The sauce is very flavorful and goes well with the chicken and broccoli.  We added more cayenne pepper b/c we like things hot!!!  Only thing we would do differntly next time is add some more broccoli or add some snow peas.

I don't usually like stir-fries, but this was very tasty.  Used pork instead of chicken and tasted great!

This was fantastic!!  My first hand a 'Thai' food.  I could not find 'white' cayenne so I used 'red'.  This worked WONDERFULLY.  The only I will do different next time it to use a LARGER skillet.

THANKS ...

As other reviews have mentioned I also doubled up on the sauce and  served it with Basmati & Wild Rice and altered the cayenne to taste, we like it spicy! It was delicious.

This is definately very delicious! Husband and son loved it! I did double the sauce and added water too. But next time I will cut the chicken instead of leaving whole. This will cook the chicken quicker and easier to eat when done.
Very good!!!1

Not a big hit here. As others have noted, the sauce definitely needs to be doubled, as 1/3 cup of sauce won't coat nearly a pound of chicken and 2 cups of broccoli. We found it to be a bit flat, tasting mostly of peanut butter and ginger.

I halved this recipe because there are only two of us and I wanted to test first.  I did a full recipe of the sauce and also added 1/4 cup of water.  The flavour was great - warm but not too hot and will make this again.

Terrific!  Added about 1/4 cup water when adding sauce and allowed it to cook down to our desired thickness.  Hubby said,"We can have this anytime."  Thanks!
