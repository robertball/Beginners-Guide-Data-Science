These were great.  I didn't have pretzels so I used Italian bread crumbs and some mustard.

I added a tbls of dijon to the mix and actually added some chopped onion.  This were really moist but next time I will add more dijon to pick up the flavor.  I did add about 1/8 of a tsp of black pepper and next time will probably increase that also.

Very moist...I love the honey-mustard pretzels so I was really looking forward to these burgers but it did not add that much of the flavor...next time, I will use more and I think I will not use the egg and then grill them in a grill pan. Will update on the results! Thanks for the recipe! 
UPDATE: I mixed the lean turkey meat, green peppers, pretzels, and some dijon mustard together and pattied out the burgers. Ohh I added chopped cilantro and thought it went awesome with it! I grilled on a grill pan and they were excellent. Thanks for the recipe!!!

I didn't feel that the honey mustard pretzels added much flavor, but the burgers were very moist, and we enjoyed them.  I'd likely add some dijon to the patty mix if I wanted more mustard flavor.  
As a side note, though, I did fall in love with just eating the flavored pretzels!

Suprisingly good, even though it looked dry, it was great -- I used red pepper, because thats what I had on hand, and sharp cheddar cheese.  Served on a slice of toasted rye bread. The cheese, mustard pretzels & rye bread flavors blended together really well.  Grilled for about 7 min, each side.

My son is allergic to eggs, so I used and egg substitute. I also had a red bell pepper and no green and plain pretzels. It turned out well and my son really liked it. I was worried they would be to crumbly with the EnerG egg substitute, but it was just fine.

This was really good.  I had it for dinner on a bun, and with lettuce, tomato, etc it was like eating a beef burger.  I ate another patty the following day for lunch, and I think I liked it better. You could taste it for what it was, and it was good. :)

They were decent.  The flavor is not quite there.  Maybe a little worchestershire, and saute the peppers ahead.

I don't think it's the recipe entirely... We just aren't used to turkey burgers... I think the white meat also makes it less desireable... I would try to make it brown with some BBQ sauce or something.  It really didn't have much flavor either; I even used jalepeno's instead of bell pepper and not enough to punch up this boring turkey!@  Sorry, I'm not a fan!

Great recipe! Like others, I substituted Italian bread crumbs for the pretzels.  I didn't have Dijon mustard, so I used ground mustard. I also added Worcestershire sauce, bell peppers, and onions. I also added a splash of buttermilk.  Really juicy & tasty! Thanks!

Superbowl sliders! Loved these but made them smaller to put on Hawaiian Rolls for sliders for the big game. You don't get a strong honey mustard flavor but that doesn't matter much. The burgers are moist and flavorful. They hold together well and were a big hit, made about 15 mini patties. Besides cheese and the buns I served them with caramelized onions and a mayo sriracha sauce to  add a little kick. Can't wait for my next game day!
