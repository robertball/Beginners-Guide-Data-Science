My husband prepared this while I was at work, The only adjustments we made was that we baked it since we don't have a grill.  We baked it at 450 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes.  I'm not a fish lover either but this was great!

A great recipe.  However, when grilling a flaky white fish, I recommend using a fish-specific grilling piece or separating the fish from the grill on a piece of aluminum foil.  Otherwise, the fish will break apart and fall into your grill.

Husband who does NOT care for fish loved this dish.  Marinated the fish for two hours, flipping the bag several times and then proceeded to grill.   NOTE:  The olive oil in the marinade causes flare ups - watch the fish carefully for the first couple of minutes until the oil burns off .....

I want to start off by saying that I am NOT a fish person. I have really been trying to eat healthier.. and giving fish another try.

In saying that.. I have tried several recipes that make the "even fish people like this" claim. This one definitely delivered! It tasted just like steak. Mmm!! No fishy flavor at all... I followed the recipe exactly (omited the basil because I didn't have any on hand)

I made this at my restaurant in Amsterdam as a last minute "FIND ME A RECIPE"!!! Great! I served it over a bed of rucola, with grilled artichokes and red paprika, with a few pine nuts. It looked and tasted great! Cook 1 min longer each side for thicker steaks.

This was so flavorful and good!  It's my favorite way to marinade fish.  I sauted the fish instead of grilling and it was excellent.

I used tilapia fillets and really liked the flavor with this recipe.  However I should have cut back on the salt! I will make this again but will use half the salt.

Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful! I had decided to make rice pilaf, and even though I'm not a fish eater, it just seemed right to have fish with the rice.  I told my husband I'd have fish, but he had to BBQ it... he told me he would BBQ if I found him a good recipe. Well, this was it!  The fish tasted so good, I didn't even use tarter sauce, which is usually a must for me when it comes to fish.  Like some of the others, I used fresh basil from my garden, too. Thank you for this GREAT recipe!

As per usual with these reviews it seems, someone in the household is not a big fish fan, but this worked well. I added more garlic as I am wont to do.  Used the Hamilton Beach indoor grill for ten minutes. Perfect fish. I added a little of the marinade on the top of mine after cooking because there was some garlic just sitting there. I will try to use it on soome of the fish that is higher in omega-3s next time.  See:  http://www.oceansalive.org/eat.cfm Overall, highly recommended.

Well...it's good, but it didn't blow me away.  In all fairness, it might have been the fish I was using.  I bought a huge bag (actually, my husband picked it) of fish in the frozen section, not a good idea.  Fresh fish is 100x better.  Anyhow, this was super easy to prepare and there certainly wasn't anything wrong with it, but I've had better fish.  Ah, try it, who knows, maybe you'll love it!

Fantastic!  A big hit with my family.  I added a little more garlic because I love garlic but otherwise followed recipe exactly.

I honestly have never had better fish in my life. Even my 7 year old who eats nothing but chicken strips and pizza, asked for seconds. I did bake it instead of grilling. I baked in a glass casserole dish on 375 for 7 and a half minutes on each side. I made sure to coat the dish in butter, that added a nice flavor to the fish along with the marinade. Amazing.....

Pretty good overall.  Need a bit more flavor, maybe lemon??   

Problem is I got hooked on Homer, AK halibut fresh off the boat so it is not really comparing apples to apples.  Sort of like Mom's cooking...can anyone beat your mom's cooking?!?  Thanks for the recipe.  It's a keeper!

this turned out really good. i did think maybe a tiny bit less salt. other than that, it was perfect. i used talapia instead of hailbut and followed recipe exactly. did not bbq though, baked in oven on 350 for about 15 minutes. my husbands response was, "it tastes like a restaurant." since i never order fish in a restaurant, i had to take his word on this. he loved it, said it was the best ive made so far. this would make an awesome salmon!

We used Cod and it came out fantastic.  Melt in your mouth YUM!  1 hour in the fridge is fine but we found that at least 2 hours makes it that much better.

Restaurant Fare! I was looking for a great halibut recipe without a cream sauce. Made this using the suggestions of another reviewer by serving over rucola (argula) with artichoke hearts and a little paprika for color. It works well with halibut steak, too. Very impressive and oh soooo good! Thank you!

Really Good!!  May even make fish eaters out of my family.  Used cilantro instead of basil/parsley (personal preference) and I will use a little less salt next time.  Not sure if marinating for 2+ hours added to the saltiness (and I LOVE salt).  Highly recommend -- the marinade takes the fish smell away for those of you who don't care for fish, either :-)  I used haddock in a grill "basket" but wouldn't hesitate to use another white fish next time. And there will definitely be a next time!

This was delicious. My husband said it was one of the best fish dishes he's had. We used a non-stick skillet instead of the grill as it was too hot outside but it was wonderful just the same. I also used fresh basil from the garden instead of dried.

The hablibut turned out awesome- next time I will add half the amount of salt called for because it was a bit too salty for me. I made the fish steaks in my stovetop grill pan and they turned out perfect.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wow! This marinade is so simple yet soooo delicious! At first I thought there was way too much salt and "salty" flavors but everything blended together to make exceptionally savory fish.  My halibut filet was about an inch and a half thick so I grilled the fish for an extra minute on each side and it came out perfect!

I've made this twice with halibut and orange roughy and the flavor was great with both.  Very easy, too.  I broiled the fish in the oven for 3-5 minutes per side, depending on the thickness of the fish.

Great marinade.  I doubled the garlic, added more lemon juice, lemon zest, and used fresh basil instead of dried. I've tried it on cod and it's even good on chicken.  You must try this.

Didn't have basil so omitted it. I pan cooked mine instead of grilling. Also, to cut down on the calories/fat, i used 2.5 TBS of olive oil instead of 6. Dish was simple and great tasting. Thanks

Very good!  I used tilapia fillets and everything else in the recipe.  I mixed the marinade up in my baking pan and turned them to coat well and baked them right away in the mixture and they were wonderful.

This is a great marinade!  We have tried it with both grouper, and sea bass, and it has been delicious with both fish. It is so easy that it can be made in the morning with the fish marinating all day, and grilled that night.

This was delicious!  I used it to marinate some frozen whiting filet.  I let the fish marinate while it was defrosting, and then put everything in the broiler.  It was so simple to make, and my family loved it!

Our favorite fish recipe.  I use Cod instead of Halibut. It's usually thinner and less expensive. Followed the recipe with suggestions, use less salt, freshly ground pepper and more lemon. Marinate 3-4 hours but have done so overnight as well. I add a dash of Emeril's seasoning and cook on the  gas grill on my (rectangular)  lightly oiled cast iron pan.   Preheat the pan on the grill, cook the cod a few minutes per side and then turn the grill off for a few minutes, while the cod finishes cooking.  Cod has an uneven thickness so you need to add the thin pieces after the thick ones. Everyone I have served this to loves it.

Great recipe. As per other reviewers, I cut down on the salt (used about 25% less) and I am glad that I did as otherwise it would've likely been too salty. I used tilapia and baked for 15-20 minutes at 350 and loved the taste of the fish. I had way more than just two fillets so I doubled the recipe in terms of spices but still used only 6 tablespoons of olive oil. This was more than enough as it coated all 6 fillets that I had perfectly.

Incredo recipe for halibut. 10++++ ! A+++++! It's easy and it's unbelievably delicious. If you've got anyone you're trying to get off of red meat and onto fish for the sake of their health, here's a recipe that sacrifices nothing in taste.

This was delicious.  I followed the recipe without any modifications, and I didn't find it too salty as other reviewers had.  I started it on the grill, but ran out of propane, so I had to finish it under the broiler.  Halibut has always been my favorite fish anyway because of it's mild flavor and great texture, and this recipe has given me a way to enjoy it at home.  I agree with many others that it is a bit pricey though, so we probably won't make it as often as I would like.  I would recommend this recipe.  I'll bet this would even work well on shrimp.

Easy and delicious.  I used Mahi  Mahi and Salmon -marinated for an hour and grilled.  Both were excellent.  I served with cole slaw and baked beans and rolls for a picnic style dinner.

This recipe is great, but it calls for too much salt.  Salt water fish is salty enough - you can always shake more salt on if you like but you can't take it out once it is in.

I often come to this website to get recipes.  The reviews have never let me down.  This recipes after several years has caused me to join allrecipes in order to give it a review.  This was the best fish I have ever had!  No lie.  I would have never have thought it as the recipe is kinda simple, but WOW.  The only changes were fresh basil (out of dry, but had a plant outside) and I used cod (halibut needed a loan to buy at my store).  Just great!  Thank you!

Fantastic! Light, subtle flavours that blend perfectly with Halibut. We used about 2 tbs olive oil instead of 6. Fantastic! We made it twice in two weeks.

I used halibut and I didn't enjoy this recipe. After reading reviews that it could be bland, I made sure to spoon a bit of the marinade on top for extra flavor while cooking. Unfortunately, that's where the reviews of it being too salty came in. I do like tuna steaks, so I would try this on them. I will cut the salt by half or more, or just sprinkle some on while cooking, and spoon on the marinade for some extra oomph. Thanks for the recipe, it's a good start.

The store didn't have halibut so I made this with tilapia instead. I marinaded the fish for about 6 hours. The flavor was good but if I were to make it again, I would add some minced garlic. Nice recipe though. Really easy. Thanks, Colleen!

In an effort to be healthier, I'm trying to incorporate fish into our diet.  This was great.  It didn't have that fishy flavor.  It was very easy & fast.  I used a tsp dry parsley instead of fresh & haddock instead of hallibut.  It was snowing, cold & windy when I grilled this, so I just dumped the fish & marinade onto a piece of foil & went back inside.  Super.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was absolutely WONDERFUL with Tilapia! I am not a fish eater at ALL but my husband made this for our valentine's day dinner. Neither one of us had ever cooked fish, but he said it was really easy to make (he used a grill pan on the stovetop). I think I'm going to make him make it again next week!

I think this is the best halibut!! My husband and I just love this recipe. We've cooked it multiple times and it always comes out perfect! I did cut the olive oil down to 3 TB. and that's plenty for our taste. Thanks for sharing!!

Wow, at first i was weary of how this recipe would come out despite the majority of good reviews. But after trying it yesterday for my fiance, it was absolutely delicious! I did however tweek the recipe. I tasted the mixture before hand and added a little bit more lemon juice and salt & pepper. I also left the fish marinating in the fridge for an extra 30 mins just to make sure the fish wouldn't turn out bland. And one more thing, instead of using Halibut I decided to be bold and used Basa fillets instead. It was still amazing!

I made this with Chilean sea bass and it was great! I only made a couple changes. I didn't have a grill available, so i sautéed it in a skillet on the stove with white wine and slightly less olive oil. And I only marinated it for half an hour. I didn't notice any loss of flavor from this. I served it with baked red potatoes and steamed green beans.

I will definitely halve the salt next time. I'm going to be drinking water all night! I was in a hurry to put the ingredients together or I would have noticed it was a lot of salt for two servings.
Another thing I won't do next time is to put the fish on the open grill - suggestions to use foil are good but I think I'll use a frying pan.

My husband went fishing in Alaska, and brought home 100 lbs of Halibut, so we have been trying different recipes, and this is definitely our favorite.  We marinade the fish for about 2 hours and then grill.  Keep a close eye on the fish while grilling, a few extra minutes can mean the difference between a great dish and a dry one.  We followed the advice of some reviewers and cut back on the salt and also made it exactly as stated in the recipe; we didn't notice a difference between the two, I'm wondering if the type of fish used makes the marinade seem to salty to some.  We also use the Italian parsley.

As a chef for a retirement community. Our residents HATE fish. We have to make it when it shows up on the calendar. I used this recipe to marinade the fish 24 hours in advance. Needless to say I was surprised when Good reviews started coming in. The other chefs and I also tried it. I normally hate fish but this was really good. Definitely a recipe to use again.

Tried this recipe for a family gathering this weekend and it was a hit. It was my first time using the recipe so I was kind of nervouse. I bgrilled some chicken breast's just incase it didn't turn out well. Everyone went for the grilled fish and loved it. I did everything just as the instructions read except that I added a dash of Cayanne pepper and  paprika for some heat.

I served it with grilled shrimp over fetuccinne alfredo and a side of asparagus wrapped with prosciutto. I will be making this more often, it was that good.

Fantastic tasting fish---I used tilapia which is usually a very bland tasting fish-but with this marinade the tilapia just burst with flavor--made it exactly as written but did let it marinade for about 2 hours. Will def make again.

Awesome. So simple, yet the mixture of these flavors go so well together. We used halibut- don't cut back and use another fish. I love all seafood, and we rarely buy halibut because of its price. Im glad we did because this is my new go to recipe for date nights with my husband when we are staying home!

Made this using a firm fish(marlin) and marinaded it for about 6 hours. I felt there was very little flavor. Maybe it was because I reduced the salt as other reviewers suggested, but I don't think so. I added garlic, but it certainly needs something else...maybe a few hot pepper flakes. It was good enought to keep and work with to make it 5 stars.

Fabulous recipe, and it couldn't be easier.  I followed the directions exactly - the halibut tasted like something from a first-rate Greek restaurant.

I love Fish this recipe is one of the best for white fish. The only thing i do differently is i wrap it up in tin foil and put 2 slices of butter, its moister and juicier. All in all a great Recipe!!!

This rocked! I used tilapia, two garlic gloves, reduced salt, reduced pepper (3/4 tsp), and didn't have lemon juice so I replaced w/2 tsp lime so it wouldn't be overpowering. I didn't think this was bland at all--maybe because of the additional garlic? I also grilled the filets on foil. I forgot to drain the marinade, thus proving that foil CAN catch fire OOPS!! LOL My 7yo ate this with minimal fussing. Looking forward to trying with lemon juice and halibut.
UPDATE: Made again with halibut. Reduced S&P, used lemon, dried herbs, and extra garlic. Excellent, yet again!

We used this recipe to marinate some mahi mahi last night.  Followed the recipe exactly except to add a couple more cloves of garlic.  We grilled the fish and it cooked up beautifully... and had absolutely no flavor.  Well, it did taste like fish.  Probably won't try this one again... sorry.

The sodium content scared me but I think I lowered it a bit by substituting 1 tsp.lemon pepper and omitted the 1 tsp. salt and 1 tsp. pepper.  I still added the called for lemon juice.  Used this on fresh pollock.  It was wonderful! Even my father who barely tolorates fish had a second helping.

The garlic, lemon and parsley in the marinade are absolutely delicious with the delicate flavor of halibut.  The tsp each of salt and pepper is also right.  I marinaded a 1.25 piece of halibut for just under an hour, then baked it at 400 for 25 minutes.  The fish was tender and juicy.  We will definitely try it on the grill come summer time!

Use any kind of white, firm fish - swordfish works well as does mahi mahi.  Add some cayenne pepper and/or red pepper flakes to spice it up!

Yum! I loved it even though it was too much oil.  I would cut the oil in half and double the lemon juice.  I also used tilapia and fresh basil.  I didn't have parsley.  I will definately make again but with the changes I mentioned.

Wow!!! We LOVED this recipe! It turned out great. I was surprised at how much the flavor from the marinade went into the fish (we used halibut) in only 1 short hour. I'll DEFFINETLY be making this one again. Thank you! :)

So simple, yet so delicious!  I used 1 TB fresh basil instead of dried - much better that way, I think.  We used tilapia and it was great.  This will definitely be a keeper in my recipe box.

Excellent!  Simple!  Delicious!  Finally, a fish recipe that my husband not only likes, he repeatedly praised and helped himself to seconds (and thirds!).  I used fresh herbs from the garden.  This is a keeper for sure.

My entire family (including my picky daughters) really enjoyed this recipe. I sized up the recipe for five, used fresh grouper filets and marinated it for about 40 minutes. I really appreciated the fact that the marinade is light enough to compliment grouper's mild flavor. Grilling is a must, however. I don't think this marinade would work as well in other cooking methods. I also wouldn't recommend it for any stronger-flavored types of fish.

Great!!  I use salmon and it is absolutely delicious!!  Probably don't grill it as long, but just use judgment.  I add red pepper flakes for a kick...   it's so simple, but so scrumptious.

Halibut is one of my all-time fav. fish and we are fortunate enough to have friends in Alaska who bring us some every year.  Fab. recipe!  I had to triple the recipe and since I only had dried parsley, I used a little less.  Gourmet cusine! Thanks a bunch Colleen!

Excellent marinade! I added shallots and used it on Tilapia. I would highly recommend and will make again.

Absolutely a wonderful way to prepare any light fish.  We use some tilapia and orange roughy on two different occasions with spectacular results!  Highly recommended.

Delicious! Very versatile recipe. I did not have halibut, so I used Pike and Seabass, and it came out great! I did not have fresh parsley either, so I use dry, and I also was very generous with the lemon and garlic.

This is a very good recipe! For fish bursting with flavor use fresh basil leaves and fresh parsley leaves and use fresh lime juice instead of lemon juice. Then grill it on tinfoil so you don't loose the spices in the grill. I also used the leftover marinade mixture to brush on the fish while grilling. It's a totally awesome and very simple recipe!

Very nice recipe!  It was extremely easy to make and very flavourful.  I don't have a grill, so I pan fried.  Of course, grilling would have been much better, but mine turned out very nicely also.  I will definitely make again!

This was okay.   Too much salt... and I love salty!  It needed extra garlic also.   I took another reviewers' suggestion and coated the baking dish with butter and I enjoyed that extra bit of flavor.  (Luckily it was unsalted butter! )  I was unable to cook it on the grill because it is just too darn cold outside!  I will make this again though because I think it is a good combination of flavors;  I'll just use less salt, more garlic, and add a little better, and I definitely want to try it on the grill!

Excellent and quick recipe to put together. Careful with the olive oil on the grill as it causes flare ups and you may burn if left unattended.

This recipe was delicious. I omitted the salt due to a low sodium diet and baked the fish at 450 for twenty minutes. The fish was plenty flavorful without the salt.

The marinade for this smelled delicious!  But I made the mistake of making it with tuna instead of halibut (tuna was SO much cheaper that day) and it just tasted yucky. Would like to try again with halibut.

I felt the recipes calls for too much salt.  And I LOVE salt!  Even so, this blend of flavors was delicious.  I used fresh Snakehead filets (if you haven't tried them yet - DO) and this was the best fish I've ever eaten.  I also marinated them about 4 hours instead of 1. I grilled them 5 minutes on each side and used fresh minced basil instead of dried and omitted the parsley.  AMAZING even though it was a tad salty.  I think I may try low sodium soy sauce for next time but great flavors!

Made it exactly to the recipe. Flavors were fine,  it was way too salty. Salt should be at least half of what it calls for. I think I will try again with 1/4 t. and see how that works out. You can always add salt afterwards anyway.

For someone who is not a fish person, I really like this. I'm really trying to like fish more and this recipe was winner for me...and incentive to actually make fish for dinner! We used Hake and then grilled it. Delicious. I did think it was a bit salty so I'll cut back on the salt. I'm making it again tonight and am actually looking forward to it.

Tried this recipe last night, very easy to make.  I had all the ingredients already, just had to buy the halibut.  This was the first time my daughter and I had halibut and we both loved it. Instead of grilling it, we baked it at 450 degrees for 20 minutes.

I made this with cod and really liked it!  We don't have a grill, either, so we baked it and I added some crushed up whole wheat crackers on top.  Other than that, stuck to the recipe!  Next time I'll leave out the salt, but that's just our tastes.  Quick, easy, and fresh summer dinner!

Yes... I had a lady friend over for dinner and I knew she likes halibut so I looked for a nice way to prepare it for her. Just by chance I found this recipe and it sounded good to me. I followed the recipe to a Tee and marinaded the filets for about an hour and a half. I sautéed the filets unstead of grilling them because I had rice cooking. I had asparagus cooking and I was making a hollandaise sauce to drench it in. Everything came out perfect and my date was very impressed and we enjoyed a fine meal, good company and a nice Chardonnay. I will make this a regular on my cooking rotation.

Worked great with a nice halibut steak a friend brought back from a fishing charter in Alaska.  Wish I had a freezer full of those.

Seems a nice mango salsa would be a great topping

Delicious, and deliciously simple. I upped the olive oil a bit because I was making three fish steaks instead of two. I also cut the salt in half because a whole teaspoon seemed like a lot. Mine ended up marinating for two hours. This was a huge hit with my family and is definitely a keeper.

This is an excellent marinade for fish.  A little different  than any fish seasoning I've ever had, but everyone agreed it was delicious.  I used it for some fresh amberjack and grouper filets.

A nice, simple marinade that has ingredients that are always in my pantry.  I used dried parsley and bottled lemon in place of fresh, and it was still tasty.

My new favorite way to have ANY cut of fish. Actually lost this recipe and just had to log on to find it again. Thank goodness I was able to, cause I'd be so sad without it. 
Thanks!

Excellent recipe. It is easy and most ingredients are already on hand. The only things I did different were to use 1/2 teaspoon of pepper instead of the 1 teaspoon called for and I used dried parsley instead of fresh. The fish was delicious, not fishy at all and melted in my mouth. I will probably lay the fish on aluminum foil next time to keep it from falling through the grate.  I will be using this recipe again and again.

Very easy. Made twice for my meat-eating BF. He loved it both times. Did have to sub Mahi Mahi because the store has a hard time getting halibut for some reason.

Delicious marinade! Kept to the ingredient list as is, other than sprinkling the fillets with some paprika when cooking. I had small Orange Roughy fillets, cooked them on my cast iron grill pan for just a few minutes per side and they had great flavor. If I was using a bigger fillet/steak like halibut I would probably marinade for maybe two hours. This could go on any fish. I served with a springy pasta salad with asparagus, green beans, artichoke hearts and radishes (my own throw together recipe). Great meal.

This was really very good.  I don't like a lot of fish --- can't stand salmon --- so I was on the look-out for a good recipe for grilled fish that I would like, as well as my husband.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used a tablespoon of fresh basil that I had on hand instead of the dried basil.  I topped it with leftover chopped parsley and served it with lemon wedges.  It was really delicious, I will make this again.

Great recipe.  I just made a couple of changes.  I didn't have basil so I used 1/2 tsp of oregano and 1/2 tsp of thyme.  And I used lime instead of lemon.  I baked it wrapped in foil at 450º for 20 minutes.

Execellent way to make fish.  I decided not to grill but to bake in foil as oters suggested and it was a lot easier - I even used my toaster oven.

I pan fried the halibut steaks in sesame oil instead of grilling and also sprinkled heavily with Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning on top of the other seasonings.  Very tasty!

Very easy prep, just make sure you have as much time as you need for marinating- I made this on the spur of the moment and so we didn't eat dinner til 9pm. I followed the recipe exactly except I used dried parsley instead of fresh and baked the fish (we don't have a grill) as another reviewer did at 450F for 15 min. I often overcook fish but this was the perfect amount of time in my oven. Good flavor, but next time I will add more lemon. Will definitely make again.

Great recipe for non-fish eaters and lovers of fish alike. Easy to prepare, cook and eat!  Tip for grilling fish: Spray the grill's grate and your spatula with Pam or another cooking spray to avoid sticking.

Super easy.  I think this can be used with just about any white fish.  I used 3 medium catfish fillets.  Used all ingredients as directed.  For the fresh lemon juice, I cut 2 lemons in half and squeezed the juice right into the marinade mix.  Marinated the fish covered for 3 hours in the fridge in a pirex dish.  Took the fillets from the marinade and grilled them in a disposable aluminum pan covered in foil for about 15 minutes at an average grill temperature of 350-400 (flipped them once at 7ish minutes).  Turned out great..very lemon flavored.

This recipe was excellent. I enjoyed the mild flavor of this fish. Next time I will try marinating longer to allow the fish to absorb more of the seasoning. Excellent recipe!

Very easy to make and a very simple, but pleasant taste.  I used much less olive oil, though - only 2 tbs for 2 servings, and that was plenty.  I also broiled it, because it's the middle of winter.  I would definitely make this again.

EXCELLENT!  I used flounder; it had a great taste and was so easy to make.  Because it is January, I baked it on a cookie sheet until it was easily flaked with a fork.   Thank you for sharing your recipe!

I love it! I made this twice in two weeks.  So very very good.  Even my sister who doesn't eat fish too well, enjoyed it.

I used this recipe with the Halibut but cooked it on a cedar plank over a charcoal grill.  It was incredible. My husband doesnt care for grilled fish, but would eat this dish any day.

I thought it was good. My husband thought it was great: commented on it at least 3 times, which is unheard ot. Kids loved it (1 yr and 3 yr). I used fresh basil and dried parsley and cooked on the BBQ grill sealed in a foil packet (with the marinade).

Used tilapia. This one was good and easy for a weeknight. Cooked over indirect grill heat on a silicone mat. Would make again.

Very simple but delicious. The only change I made was that I used fresh basil since I have some in my garden.

I made this for a group of 15.  It came out excellent.  Also very easy.  I had to make this more affordable so I used Tilapia.  I put them directly on the grill and turned the fillets very carefully.  Worked out well.  Everyone loved the flavor.  I made it with "Marinated Barbequed Vegetables SUBMITTED BY: Stackhawkley".  The recipes are very similar so the veggies were a great compliment to the fish.  I also served it with Wild Rice.  Perfect for a nice outdoor summer meal.  I prepared and marinated while the kids were in school.  By the time we were ready to eat, everything went smoothly, easy and fast.  All the kids loved it too!

We loved it (adults)!  I didn't have enough time to marinate it for the full hour though - just 30 minutes.  It was still excellent and I am looking forward to a full hour next time!

This is the best halibut my husband and I have ever had! I made it for a family gathering and even the people who don't normally like fish gobbled it up. They are still talking about how great it was. The only thing I changed was only putting in about 1/4 the amount of salt. Excellent!

This was very tasty. I used dory instead of halibut.I added more garlic and lemon juice and used 3/4 of the required oil.I cut down on the salt and even then, it was quite salty. So I suggest tasting the marinade and gradually add salt to taste. The next day, I cooked the leftover dory fish with the leftover marinade and it tasted great as well!

I made this last night and it was very good, just like going to a great seafood restaurant.  The Halibut was pretty expensive, but worth it, especially for a special occasion.

Ok so let me start by saying I did not want Halibut.  I went to the store in search of Sea Bass and there was none.  But they did have Halibut.  I came home and looked for a way to cook this fish that I didn't really want.  To make a long story short....YUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!  This is a great recipe.  Its fast, easy and doesn't overpower the fish.  We will add this to our collection of great recipes.  Thank you!

MADE THIS TODAY FOR FATHERS DAY! SOOOOOOOO GOOD! Fantastic! This didn't taste fishy at all. We grilled outside med/low heat about 20 minutes. The family members that aren't fish crazy had seconds and thirds! The people that are fish crazy had fifths! It's THAT good. I could eat this weekly no doubt.

This is a great marinade! We are trying it again tonight because we liked it so well the first time. Very easy to make. I like that it is a one hour marinade. Long enough to flavor the fish but not overwelm it.

Best fish recipe I've ever made.  Even the "I hate fish" people raved over it!  I did alter slightly and used Halibut steaks instead.  Excellent!

Very tasty! I used half again the fresh lemon and a bit more fresh basil and fresh parsley than the recipe called for. I also baked it in a glass dish at 400 degrees for 25 minutes. I intended to use Halibut..I live in the Pacific NW and it's usually readily available, not this time, so I ended up using Tilapia. It was the first time for me that I didn't over cook the fish..and it got raves from my husband and two daughters. This is a recipe I'll use again and again. Thank you =)

Excellent recipe...I'm trying to get my kids to like fish and this really helped!  They asked me to make this again.  The only adjustment I made was to use lemon pepper instead of regular pepper.

Sorry but, my family didn't enjoy this at all. It seemed oily & bland. I used tilapia instead of halibut. I don't know if that made a difference.

I use this on tilapia instead of halibut (hard to get in my area) and it is FANTASTIC!  My husband and I both love it!  I made it for the first time this week with fresh garlic (instead of garlic powder, which is what is usually on hand) and it was amazing!  Great recipe!

This was very good!  Even my picky eater liked it.  The only change I made was using fresh basil.  Why use dried when you have fresh available?  Super easy.  I will be making this again.  Thanks Colleen for sharing the recipe.

WOW!!!! This was amazing! I'm not normally wild about fish, but want to cook a little healthier so I did some experimenting with this. My husband and I were so impressed. I think this must have been one of the best dishes I have ever eaten. (From my kitchen or a pros) I used flounder and grilled over foil. Other than that I wouldn't change a thing. I'll be fixing this every week!

We did this for a family cookout and it went over great with both fish lovers and haters.  We did tilapia since halibut is reeeally expensive here in the Midwest, and my husband used hickory in the grill smoker.  We also used the same marinade on chicken to give the anti-fish people an alternative, and that was great too-just marinate longer.

Finally...a relatively healthy recipe for halibut that still makes this delicate fish special (like it deserves to be).  I made this tonight on my indoor grill and it turned out wonderful!  This recipe is one of our favorites!  Thanks for sharing it!

My husband loved this recipe.  Next time I will cut back on the salt a little, but we are not salt lovers.  We used Halibut fillet and put in the oven for 10-15 mins.  This is a keeper.

Excellent dish.  Easy and tasty.  I used fresh basil only because I had it on hand and it came out very nice.

I thought this marinade was wonderful as did all my guests!  I will definitely be putting this in my rotation of marinades for halibut. :)

Excellent!  Served it to company, including a 2.5 and 4 year old and they all loved it.  Easy to prepare and very flavorful.  Will become a summer favorite.

We used halibut steaks instead of fillets.  Maybe the marinade isn't as strong with the steaks?  It was good, but I can't say knock-out.  Nonetheless, we'll make again.  Halibut is a great fish for the non-fish lovers (I say that because my dad liked it.  Also, that was the first time he's cooked fish on the grill, and only our second attempt.  It was wonderful!)  Thanks.

YUM!!!  My husband actually did the cooking this time (1st time he did it right) and it was amazing!  He grilled halibut outside and our grill is hot so he put it on medium temperature - he followed all the directions - except we were out of basil (fresh and dry) so instead of using the basil and parsley, he just put in 2 tsp of Italian Seasoning.  It came out perfectly - expensive restaurant style. Much better than my usual pan fry in olive oil, garlic, and lemon juice.  I highly recommend using this recipe.

We couldn't find halibut, so we substituted fresh snapper - it was delicious. It came out really light with a great flavor. We doubled the garlic for a little extra oomph. We'll make this one all summer long! It really is restaurant quality and easy to prepare.

I'm not a real big 'fish' person but this recipe will change anyone's mind.  I have made it twice, the second time changing a few of the seasonings and it was great both times.  As good or better than any you have had in a good restaurant.  DON'T OVERCOOK THE FISH!

Skip the salt, skimp on the olive oil and add more lemon juice to make this tasty marinade extra-healthy. The basil and parsley add a wonderful flavor - this recipe is definitely a keeper! I bet it tastes good on chicken too.

This is an excellent recipe for a nice sit down dinner... we never have halibut here so I've always used Dory (it's a good fish for pan-frying & grilling)... the first time I made it my family loved it... so now i make it whenever my mom doesn't feel like cooking :o) i don't even follow the measurements anymore, just eyeball it :o)  I'm giving this 5 stars because it tastes great with Dory. Thanx Colleen! -

This recipe was good.  I put my fish in foil packets because I didn't have a grill basket and I was afraid the fish (I used cod) might fall apart.  The flavor was good but I am not sure I would make again.  I have several other fish recipes that I like much better.

Absolutely delicious!  I used Cavali, a fish more common to our waters instead of Halibut, and I believe this is the best recipe for this sort of fish.  Thanks for sharing. :-)

Great fish!  I don't even usually like fish, but this was really good!  It's the first time I've made fish and actually liked it.  I made some minor adjustments - I used parsley flakes instead of fresh and I forgot the lemon juice, so I put a splash of lemonade in it - may sound strange, but that's all I had available!  It turned out great.  I will definitely be making this recipe again.

My family loved this.  I do not like fish so I didn't even attempt to taste it. My hubby and 2, 18yr olds gave it a definite thumbs up.  I followed the directions to a T but used a cheaper fish called Basa.  Any recipe that my 3 picky men like is worth 5 stars

I apologize but I thought this marinade was terribly disappointing. It was way too salty and oily. I threw it out before even adding it to the fish.

I've never been terribly fond of fish...HOWEVER...I LOVED this recipe! I used grouper, which was wonderful. The fish was tasty, light and flakey (even as a leftover!). I could eat this every week.

Not bad. It would have been better had I made it on a grill. But we don't have a grill, so instead I put them in a glass casserole dish in the oven for around 20 mins. I'm still not crazy about fish, but this was nice & tender. Also, I used fresh basil & omitted the parsley, as we were out. Nice one to try though.

I used this marinade for chilean sea bass. This was an excellent marinade for this fish. I marinated the chilean sea bass for about 3-4 hours then grilled in a grill pan for about 7 minutes per side. Tender, flakey, juicy fish!! Love this recipe!!

Excellent marinate!!!  My husband and I are not big fish eaters, but we loved it.  So quick and easy to make.  One suggestion: I would marinate the fish (we used tilapia) for 30 minutes instead of 1 hour so it is a bit more subtle.

My husband went on a fishing trip and caught tons of halibut so I marinated 5 filets by doubling the recipe.  Fabulous taste.  Haven't had anything much better at any restaurant (and I live on the Pacific Coast!).  Had one large filet in the fridge which I just made on my indoor grill for 10 minutes.  Will make this again and again!  Thank you!

I followed the directions, however, the fish did not cook in the middle.  Ended up finishing it in a pan.  The seasonings were delicious though.

Marinated for 2 hours. Because it was raining, I baked at 350 degrees for 15 minutes (checked after 12 minutes, but took longer as they were thick). Halibut filets were great. Served with miso-glazed sous vide turnips and broccoli salad.

I've used this recipe many times and it's perfect! I now like to use fresh basil instead of dried, and I marinate for a couple of hours. Depending on how many servings you may want to cut down on the oil or drain well to avoid flare ups. I now also baste mine with butter as they are cooking. I've used this recipe for both halibut and swordfish. Should be great with any white fish.

This was great!  I baked the fish on 450 for 15-20 minutes as recommended in comments. And I used sheep's head from our catch this weekend. I think this would work great on all kinds of fish especially something like Mahi. Yum!

Instead of draining it, I kept all the juices and pan seared it. Also used a lot more lemon juice. Totally delicious.

We loved it! I  used the marinade on fresh caught wahoo. Grilled it in a grill pan for a few minutes longer than recipe suggested since the wahoo is a dense fish. It was perfect. I would use this marinade on other white fish.

Used a metal grate on the BBQ to put the filets on & came out great. Needed about 7min on each side to cook all the way through (filets were thick).

I made this tonight using some cod, and flaked it for fish tacos. I wasn't able to grill it so I lightly pan fried. Delicious! The family ate it up, it was simple and easy to prepare.

I just poured the marinade on top of  the fish (Mahi mahi) while they sat in the dish I was going to cook them in.  They sat for about 15 min. before going into a 400F oven for 12 min.
Results were great!  I will cook more fish this way as my husband, who is not a great fish lover, really enjoyed this dish!

Soooo good!  An excellent balance of flavors.  We had some thick Alaskan Halibut steaks and this recipe was perfect...EXCEPT...I used half the amount of salt. I use Redmond's Real Salt, so FYI. Salts (table salt, sea salts, etc...) all have varying degrees of saltiness so go with your gut and experience on the amount of salt you use.  Great recipe!

I wanted to grill fish and chicken kebabs on the BBQ and was looking for a good marinade for both. This worked great! I read some of the reviews and noted some people found it too salty, so I cut the salt in half, and added a bit more garlic. I used fresh parsley and fresh basil from our garden, and marinated the chicken breast in chunks for 5-6 hours, and used both ahi tuna and mahi-mahi steaks* (marinated for 3-4 hours, then cut the fish into chunks just before skewering.) I did not drain off the marinade, but instead basted them more while cooking. Paired the kebabs with red peppers, mushrooms, onion and zucchini. Everyone raved about it all! The fish was particularly good, but the chicken was a hit as well. Served with rice pilaf and coleslaw. I think I've found my "go-to" simple, fresh marinade!!

*actually used flash frozen ahi and mahi mahi that I defrosted overnight - no one knew the difference!! Delicious!

I used salmon instead of halibut which was my mistake . I was also under the pretense I had lake trout  in my possession  as well  ( since halibut doesn't swim in our great lakes).   This recipe added great flavor . It neglected to  mute the fish taste as much as I would have liked though  .

The marinade gave the fish a great  flavor without overpowering it. I only used 4 Tblsp of oil and would probably do less next time. I also baked the fish instead...400 degrees for 20 minutes.

The marinade really makes this dish. We will add this to our family menu, but only when Halibut goes on sale.

Both my fish-hating partner and I loved this dish. I did make it slightly different, used tilapia instead of halibut due to availability.

Nice combination of flavors in the marinade penetrated the fish just right. I used cod b/c it was on sale and used another reviewer's method of cooking in oven at 450 degrees for 15 - 20 minutes.

This is the best marinade for halibut that I've found after trying several. Excellent pairing of spices for the mild fish. I left out the salt entirely (I never use salt) and didn't miss it. I had fresh basil and parsley on hand, but I'm sure dried would work as well. Place the fish on aluminum foil rather directly than the grill. I lightly oil the foil with olive oil first.

This was wonderful. Used a big piece of cod and marinated for 6 hours. Grilled beautifully on a piece of heavy duty foil. My family raved over this and I will be making it again.

Very good marinade for fish! I added a splash of white wine to the leftover marinade and heated it through before pouring on the cooked fish. This recipe is a keeper.

I've made this several times, and it never disappoints. It's one of the few non-fried fish dishes my kids will eat. It's a tad salty, but we still don't deviate from the marinade. The only thing we sub is the fish from time to time. Living in the Midwest in a smaller town, it's difficult to find decent halibut at a decent price. Cod is inexpensive and seems to hold up well enough on the grill. All in all, one of our favorites.

This was amazing. I'm not a fish person but trying to eat more. This was INCREDIBLE. I followed the recipe but cut the salt to half and used kosher salt and decreased the olive oil to 3 tbs for .6 lbs filet because we're watching calories. Marinated for just under 2 hours. Used fresh parsley. I don't have a grill, so I followed the directions in this recipe for cooking: http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013187-pan-seared-marinated-halibut-fillets.

I used freshly caught Stripped Sea Bass form Montauk. I grilled it 4 minutes skin side down, then flipped for another 4 minutes. Came out perfect. I will definitely  make this again. Quick, easy and delicious. .

I used a different kind of fish and it worked out fine. Marinated it overnight, however the edges turned a little salty (but still okay). Baked the fish in the oven and it turned out good and tasty. My husband liked it as well. Will keep this recipe for future use again. Thanks a lot for sharing.

I made this tonight for dinner and loved it! I did make a few changes though. I omitted the salt and only used one tablespoon of olive oil. I used fresh basil instead of dried because I find it more flavourful. And I didn't add parsley because I find it tasteless. The result was delicious, I will definitely make this again. Thank you for sharing this recipe Sadie, it's a keeper!

Awesome!! Made just as is. Quadrupled marinade amount as I had almost 3 lbs. of Halibut. Everyone raved about it, even my pescatarian friend- he know fish! I'd make this for my mother-n-law-  and she's picky!

I made it was rockfish instead of halibut, and cooked it on the foreman grill on high heat since I was only making one piece. It is so flavorful! I will definitely use this recipe again and will try it with other fish.

I marinated for 30 minutes and cut the salt in half.  It could use more seasoning....  like Greek Seasoning or lemon pepper.  I'll try this again.

Really enjoyed!  I had some nice very thick snapper steaks that were caught on a deep sea fishing trip and had planned on grilling it but it started raining so I opted to saute in some butter and olive oil.  I marinated it about 4 hrs since they were so thick, and by accident I only used half the olive oil and lemon juice but it still worked. I used the wrong measuring spoon (stupid me, lol).  I did however, half the salt due to other comments.  It went very well with the Garlic & Basil Wild Rice I made to go with it.  Excited to make fish tacos with the leftovers tomorrow.***update, the fish tacos were great!

This marinade is perfect for white fish. I had a 1 1/4 pound, 1 1/2 inch thick filet of halibut. Made The marinade exactly as written with just a touch less salt. Gave it one hour to marinade and baked it at 450 for 25 minutes. The flavor was outstanding and the fish was juicy all the way through. This will definitely be my go-to marinade for any white fish from now on.

I made this tonight using tilapia instead of halibut. I also did what other people recommended which was to put foil on the grill. My whole family gobbled the fish up! I have three picky eaters (ages range from 7 - 13) and they loved eating it!!! I will definitely make this again!

I'd give this 10 stars if I could! Super tasty on our huge halibut steak, better than our favorite restaurant. Only change I made to the doubled recipe was to halve the olive oil. Forgot to oil the grill which made it a little sticky when we went to turn it but it was such a big steak it wasn't an issue. Definitely a keeper!

Excellent. I used Tilapia.  This was my first attempt to grill fish. I was able to put the marinade together quickly, add to the fish, place into a tupperware container, place container into cooler and take to a picnic. I have a perforated porcelain coated cooking surface attachment that i used to place on top of my cast iron grill that added to the ease of cooking.

This was so flavorful. I only had tilapia so I used it on that. The fish was so moist. The salt was a little high so I will cut it back next time I use this. My young son (3 1/2 years) also loved it.

Very tasty. The saltiness was ok when eaten with something bland (pasta, vegetables,etc) but on it's own I found it much too salty. I will halve the amount of salt the next time I make this. Otherwise - easy and delicious.

I didn't chop anything, just put everything in a blender. And I grilled on a grill pan. It was delicious! Even my super picky son who would stay miles away from any kind of vegetable and fish, wanted to have some more! This is going to be The Recipe I will use everytime I invite someone.

Easy, fabulous and fresh!!  I used frozen halibut steaks which smelled a little fishy when defrosted.  Absolutely no fishy odor or taste with this quick one hour marinade! Pleasantly surprised. Will definitely use this flavor combo again!

I don't like fish but loved this. Used cod and it was very, very good. To cold to grill so baked at 350 degrees about 20 minutes. We will be eating more fish. My husband, who loves fish, and I thank you.

surprising recipe!  i never thought grilled fish could have so much flavor.  as others have stated, i will use a little less salt next time, and also foil on the grill cause i had a hard time getting the cooked fish off the grill.  proof it's awesome:  my husband has requested this recipe again tonight, that's why i'm here!

This has a nice delicate flavor that doesn't overpower the fish (I used catfish). For my tastes, there was way too much salt - maybe 1/4 tsp would have been enough. Also, I had to cook the catfish fillets 8 minutes per side to get them completely cooked.

Excellent!!!  I used Mahi instead of halibut and less olive oil than suggested (probably about half).  Next time I think I will reduce the salt.  Truly a terrific recipe.

I thought it was great!  I didn't have any basil and used parsley flakes instead of fresh chopped parsley, but still tasted wonderful.  My husband is a very picky eater, pretty much meat and potatoes.  I made this and he actually liked it and said he wouldn't mind me making this again. I'm always looking for healthy recipes and this one is definitely a winner!

I can't believe how tasty this was!  Looking through the recipe, I thought it would be a bit boring, but tried it based on the reviews.  I'm so glad I did.  I used arctic char and baked it at 375F for 12min.  My 3 year old who is not a big fan of fish had seconds and went on and on about how delicious it was and that he wants me to make it all the time.  My really picky husband loved it as well as my sister and my 2yr old- all of whom have different tastes.  I used the spices as directed but did not marinade and used a seasoned salt which had rosemary and sage in it as well.  Absolutely delicious!

Great flavors, while not overpowering the halibut.  Added diced Greek olives for a little more flavor.

The marinade was ok. Very basic.  It added flavor but not as much as we would have liked.  Next time we try this we'll marinade longer.  We are a no to low salt family so we always cut the salt out.

OMG! That was the best fish I have ever made! I baked it at 450 for 25 mins. because we don't have a grill. It turned out great. Now I want to have a dinner party just so I can serve this dish. Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

My family of 4 don't really like fish but I tried this recipe and it was a huge hit!  In order to highlight how much we liked this I'll tell the whole story.  I cooked pork chops the same night just in case we didn't like it.  No one ate the pork and all went back for seconds of the fish!  I was dumbfounded!  I did add fresh dill to the marinade and it came out beautifully!  Will be cooking this a LOT!

I've been craving fish for sometime, my significant other won't touch it unless it's fried. This ranks way up there for me, and is very simple to prepare, I'll be having this again real soon.

Excellent!  I used fresh haddock and placed them in aluminum pans to cook on the bbq.  The fish flaked nicely so we just took it right from the pans.  I enjoyed the taste immensely and can't wait for relatives to arrive this summer to try it out on them.  Thanks for the recipe.

A WONDERFUL way to grill fish!  We used cod b/c that's what we had on hand, and it really gave the normally pretty flavorless fish some zing.  The only change I made to the recipe was fresh basil, since we have our own plant.  SO VERY TASTY!!

This was pretty good.  Used tilapia since that's what we had and it was fine.  It got a little flaky on the grill so next time we might use foil underneath.  Overall, nice flavor.

I have made this recipe several times now, and I love it! I have used tilapia every time, which works perfectly. It does drip into the grill, so you may want to put foil down before adding the fish. I have also made it in the oven, which is good too, but it definitely makes a big difference when this recipe is cooked on the grill.

This is a very easy recipe and has wonderful flavor.  If I don't have fresh parsley, I use 1 tsp. dried.  I've used this for Northern and Walleye and it's wonderful.

I prepared this recipe for a dinner party of 10. I used the freshest halibut filets I could find and marinated them for 3 - 4 hours. Everyone RAVED about how good they were and I had to e-mail them all the recipe the next day.

Wow - This recipes was incredible.  I think it was the best fish I have ever had.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I baked it for 20 minutes at 450 degrees and it was delicious.  It probably helped that my daughters boyfriend brought us fresh halibut from Alaska.  This recipe really did it justice.

What a wonderful way to grill fish.  I made it exactly as stated and thought that it did not even have a fishy taste.  I used halibut and will use on other fish also.  Can't wait to buy some more fish.

I am, at best, an amateur cook. This was easy, delicious, and well received by my family, who tends to worry when I volunteer to cook. My only recommendation would be to use maybe, half or three-quarters the salt. Otherwise it was perfect. I used dried parsley and garlic powder, not having fresh, and it was still wonderful.

Excellent...I cook a lot of fish and was looking for something healthy and different and this was great.  I used canned minced garlic and dry parsley flakes instead of fresh.  I also used Sheephead instead of halibut.

Fabulous flavor.  My husband grilled the halibut therefore it didn't get over-cooked.  The best healthy fish I've had.

Good idea but not quite there. I do like this recipe but it needs some changes. There wasn't enough flavor of the marinade in my halibut. So I will probably marinate a little longer. And add more of the ingredients I like. This recipe is a keeper but it will need your own touches.

I am not a fish person but this recipe was the best I have ever had. I marinated the fish over night then just grilled it on my grilling machine for 7 minutes and it turned out wonderful. You could use this recipe on chicken and get great results from it.

The marinade is awesome! I made this with ocean perch and it came out fab! I reduced the olive oil based on another reviewer's comment and used fresh basil and parsley. We'll definitely make this again!

This is the first time I've liked halibut!  Great, simple recipe.  I used fresh basil (used 1 tablespoon) because I had it on hand.

I used fresh oregano instead of basil and dried parsley instead of fresh. I used a blender to mix the marinade. We used it on red snapper filets on the outside grill. It was delicious.

This was a great marinade, very easy and flavorful.  I didn't change anything.  I'll agree with an earlier comment that the longer you cook it, the better it tastes.

I followed the recipe exactly and baked it in the oven for 15 minutes at 450 degrees. The halibut I used was fresh from Homer Alaska, and it was terrific!
Even better the next day - I used leftovers for halibut tacos and it paired up very nicely with the Avocado Mango salsa recipe also in the website.

This was my first time making halibut. With the exception of adding a little extra lemon juice, I followed the recipe exactly. It was DEEEELISH! My husband said it was one of the best meals he's ever eaten. 

How good was it? It was so good, that after we ate our halibut for supper, I went back to the store and got more to BBQ the next day.

WOW! This was soooo delicious!!  The whole family loved it, even my dd, who wont even mutter the "f" word (fish), had to admit she liked it.  We used mahi mahi cuz its all we had.  The only very minor change I will make next time is to use less salt or maybe even omit it, and that is coming from a salt lover.  We will definitely make this many more times to come.

I made this recipe using grouper and baked at 375 for 30 mintues.  Very flavorful. Stops any 'fishy' taste. Will make it again.  I found the dried basil to be a little strong, will try using fresh basil next time.

I was disappointed in this recipe. It had zero flavor...could be because I started with semi-frozen fish, but they did marinate for well over an hour and nothing. Giving it 2 stars because it was easy! Based on great reviews, will give it another try with thawed fish.

This recipe was wonderful!  Thank you so much for sharing.  I would recommend cutting back on the pepper or it is a little spicy, and I only did half the salt.  Thanks!!

This was amazing and worthy of a restaurant.  I wanted to make my fiance a really great meal and this did it.  There's nothing better than hearing, "Mmmmmm," through the whole meal.  I served this with mashed potatoes.

This was awesome, and I only marinated for 1hr! Will make again for sure. Also added some Lemon Pepper seasoning. YUM

This was wonderful. This is the first time I have prepared halibut and this recipe was perfect. A definite keeper!

Colleen, This recipe was GREAT! Quick & easy! I altered it slightly by using fresh basil (was out of dried) and my boyfriend raved over it...  I will definitely pass it on. Thank you!

Very good marinade- simple enough since it is all ingrediants I normally have on hand. I used a fillet instead of a steak. My husband and 2 year old loved it.
