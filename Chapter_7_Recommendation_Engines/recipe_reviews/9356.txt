This is a good recipe but my husband and son did not like the oysters, so the second time I cooked this I made them their own and I used 1LB sausage, 1 cup+ of chicken broth and two cups of cooked crumbled corn bread.I followed the recipe deleting the oysters and its juice and added my ingredients.  They loved it.  Next time I am going to use 1/2 LB sausage and a cup of diced cooked chicken livers!

I've made this recipe many times and it's always a hit.  I use 2 boxes of Uncle Ben's Wild Rice with seasoning, 1 lb of sage sausage, and I dice up the oysters VERY small.  It's GREAT.  Thanks for a fantastic recipe.

I've been looking for an oyster dressing for years that was this good. The kids won't try it, but that's alright. There's more for me. It's just too easy. Thanks for the recipe.

This is really tasty if you are a fan of oysters and wild rice.  I made it as a main dish casserole, not a side dish, and I think next time I'll use half the amount of rice to concentrate the other flavors.  But as a dressing, it was pretty close to perfect as is!

I don't like this, Mark did.  I'll probably never make again.  If I do, rinse canned oysters under cold water.  I also halved recipe.

This was a great hit with my seafood-loving   friends. I modified it somewhat by adding soy sauce swirled in hot butter and not using the oven at all, since it was full of other things at Thanksgiving.

Thank you for the recipe.

If you are looking for a creative alternative to bread or corn bread based stuffing/dressing, this is a good choice. I made the classic cooking 101 mistake; I added one teaspoon of salt without tasting the mixture. That was *way* too much (you may not need to add any), so I used some potatoes to remove some of the salt flavor, which seemed to work pretty well (though it sounds like a myth to me). I really enjoyed this combination of flavors. I used more sausage than what was called for, close to a pound, which was a good choice. Next time I will add more oysters or not chop them as finely. We did not notice the oysters in individual bites because I chopped them so finely.

I simple but very good recipe. Not being able to remember the way my Mom made it, I took this recipe and added to it. I used Tasso instead of the pork and added ground meat and merliton. A very good dish. Thanks for the recipe!

Great combination of rice and oyster!  I mixed all the ingredients (except paprika for I ran out of it) in a bowl and put them in turkey.  The result was awesome! Wild rice was nice and crunchy and everyone loved it. Thanks for the recipe.
