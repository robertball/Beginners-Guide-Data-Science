I thought this recipe was delicious. It was quick and easy which made it even better. The fresh mushrooms really add a good flavor to it. I used some leftover brown rice that we had and it worked really well.

Very good recipe!  I did add an onion and sauteed it with the mushrooms before adding the rest of the ingrediants, but this was a great tasting and easy to make soup!!!!

My family loved this recipe.  It was awesome and really easy.  I loved how healthy it was.  My husband usually hates brown rice, but he liked it in this soup.

This is the kind of soup I want brought to me the next time I'm in bed, sick!!!  So hearty, comforting and satisfying.  I advise cooking your own chicken breasts in chicken broth for the most flavor.  Serve with a loaf of soft bread and softened butter.  Excellent meal!  My boyfriend ate this soup as leftovers for three days until it disappeared!  :)
