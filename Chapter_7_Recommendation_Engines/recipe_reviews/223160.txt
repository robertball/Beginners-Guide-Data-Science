This is a solid recipe but I have to admit that when I saw 'buttermilk' as ingredient I was more than a little surprised, as I have never seen buttermilk at the Mexican markets.  So I went and asked - indeed they do have Mexican buttermilk sold right by the Mexican Crema (sour cream) so I bought two containers and a bunch of pepper and set off to make this.  NOTE:  I roasted the peppers of the BBQ and tossed into a freezer bag and put that in a metal bowl and covered with a towel until cool and then into the fridge over night. Those pepper were so easy to peel and seed!  I was so excited!  - Now back to the recipe.  Next time I would make them reserving some of the sauce on the stove on warm - bake and then top with more warm sauce.  They don't hold as well as I would like and this would give them a great freshen up.  Thank you for a new recipe - I made this for the Faceless Frenzy July 2012.

Wonderful enchilada recipe, the store didn't have anaheim peppers so I used poblano instead and used 3 jalepeno for heat. I also charred the peppers on the grill and the chicken breast too for depth of flavor.

Reminds me of Enchiladas Suiza at my favorite Mexican restaurant.  I used 8 anaheim's instead of 4 though, and it was still very hot for the family

Yummy!! I only used 8 Anaheims, because I added 2 jalape√±os and 2 peppers that were in between. Will definitely make this again.
