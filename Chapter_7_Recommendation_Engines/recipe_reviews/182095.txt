This recipe didn't really work out.  I didn't know if the Broiler should be on high or low, then when I did put it on high, it almost started on fire!  And it still wasn't cooked through.  Then I tried again, this time with the broiler on low, and after 20 minutes of cooking, it wasn't cooked through. Maybe my mushrooms were too big. The sauce it made, on the parts that were cooked, tasted good, I guess it'll just take some tweaking to get it right.

I loved these! The only reason I am giving a 4 instead of a 5 is that 2 tablespoons of sesame oil was a bit overpowering and needs scaled down in my opinion. The recipe also doesn't state to set the broiler on  high or low but I found low to work great. The garlic really browns up in those ten minutes and adds great depth to the overall flavor.

Sesame oil burns very easily so be sure to set the broiler to low.

I don't see why these aren't getting better ratings.  The seasoning you put on these mushrooms are to suit your palette anyway.  If you are not much on sesame seed oil, go light on it, or not at all.  Be sure to broil on low, as well.  Otherwise, great shrooms!!!

I made this with emporer enoki mushrooms sliced lengthwise into "steaks" and have broiled them and, another time, grilled them on my George Foreman Grill.  On the grill they cooked in 2 - 2 1/2 minutes.  I will make this again and again.

This was literally the best mushroom side-dish recipe I've ever tried. I also don't understand why some people have rated the recipe lower - if you don't like sesame oil so much, scale down the amount you use (or as I did because we'd run out of sesame oil, use olive oil!) and watch it to make sure it doesn't burn! Use your own gut instincts...

Good thing there were some reviews, though I didn't read all right away until the broiler started smoking and the shrooms started burning.  I moved the oven rack down even farther - about 8" and switched from Broiler High to Broiler Low before my husband had to fan the smoke alarm to keep it from going off.  I think the idea for this recipe is good, but (1) way too salty with so much soy per shroom, (2) the sesame oil did seem to smoke quite a bit, had I not caught it in time it would have been disastrous, (3) would have been nice to have the instructions a little more informational about broiler temp.  The plating looked great, but it was just way too salty as written.

These mushrooms were absolutely devine, I just added 1 tablespoon sesame oil and 1 tablespoon rice bran oil to make up the amount required, cooked 150c with grill element only with open oven door.  I totally can recommend Yum yum.... 10 STARS

I made these for my wife and myself. It's super simple and fast to make. I only changed two things--not the recipe--I used large regular, whole mushrooms (washed and stems clean cut) instead of portobellos, and I grilled them on the grill, basting them with the sauce after turning every couple minutes. They were great!! Everyone loved them!! Highly recommend as an appetizer or a side to nearly anything. Try it and enjoy!!

Although really salty, my family loved these.  I marinated for about 10 minutes and then grilled them.  I made the mistake of spooning leftover marinade on top (which caused the over saltiness) so next time won't do this extra step!

Delicious. I didn't have ginger or sesame oil. I used canola oil and added about half a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar instead, and over-garlicked. Came out great, looked exactly like the photo. Will make it again, maybe next time with the actual ingredients.

Yummy. We made this recipe and paired it with sesame grilled tuna and grilled asparagus, both from all recipes as well.

When I first cut into one of these and took a first bite, the flavors exploded gently from taste bud to taste bud.  Then, as the mushroom cooled, it wasn't quite as wonderful.  Wondering if there is a way to use this recipe modified for a fondue pot with a dip........
