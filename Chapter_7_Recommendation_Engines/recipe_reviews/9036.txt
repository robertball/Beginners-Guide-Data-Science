I am giving this recipe a three overall but between a 4 and 5 on taste.  These tasted great but I just couldn't understand the sun pattern directions.  I am not sure how that was supposed to work on a standard cookie sheet.  Also with only one package of crescent rolls you were left with so much filling.  What I ended up doing was using 3 packages of rolls and putting the filling in the middle and folding the pointy end over the middle and the two other ends up.  This created little pockets with the filling.  I also only baked them for 15 minutes at 400 degrees, they were very browned at this point, any longer they would bave burned.  I will make these again but just not the way this recipe dictates.  The filling however tasted wonderful but made so much.

Everyone had seconds!  I cut the recipe in half except for the cresents (I used a whole tube)after reading other reviews.  I had no problems following the "wreath" directons.  Four adults finished the whole thing.

I didn't have cresent rolls, so I put buttered bread as a base, and bread crumbs as a topping, it was really tasty.

LOVED this recipe!  I did find the filling was more than one tube of Crescent rolls could hold WAY WAY more) so I used another tube of crescent dough and made two Roli's...  I sauteed the onion, bell pepper and garlic beforehand and used steamed frozen broccoli because I worried that with a mere 30 minute cook time the veggies would not be done.  I read other's comments about the filling being bland, so I added a packet of ranch dressing mix....and WOWEEE it made the Roli DELISHIOUS!  I turned my oven down to 350 too because they were getting brown way too fast!  Great recipe....looks soooo impressive and tastes heavenly!

I used this recipe to cater my friend's party and everyone ate them up so fast. I had extra left over in a serving bowl and people started making sandwiches with it.! A definite hit with everyone. East to make. I did all the prep work the night before.

I thought these tasted great, but I also had too much mixture left over.  It is definitely a good idea to buy two cans. Also, I used frozen broccoli and cooked it first instead of using fresh broccoli.  It is also very good without the bell peppers.

I've been making something like this for a long time.  I use two tubes of crescent roles.  I'll open them up flat, and press them together to make one long rectangle.  Then I'll fill the middle with a log of chicken topped with cheese.  The crescent role is closed by pulling the edges, alternating left and right to make a braid like look along the top. I find it cooks best on a baking stone.

Good dish for guests. I was a bit confused about laying the crescent rolls in a sun pattern until I looked through the photos of this dish and it shows exactly how to lay out rolls. That was a big help for me. Thanks photographers!

This is practically identical to one that was featured on a Pampered Chef catalog about 4 years ago.  It can be made with either chicken or ham and without any canned soup, as this recipe is.  It's not necessary to use a glass, but I'll grant that making a wreath out of crescent roll dough is not easy to explain. You simply lay out the individual triangles in a large circle, overlapping them slightly.  Then place the mixture along the center of the triangles, again in a circular pattern.  Then overlap both ends of all the dough triangles over the mixture and bake.  This is delicious and gorgeous to serve at a party.

My boyfriend and I loved this recipe! I changed a few things after reading some reviews. I flash fried the onion and peppers so they would have more flavor, and I used red peppers for color. I cooked the mixture in the microwave for about 2 1/2 minutes before putting it into the rolls. Some reviews said that the rolls cooked before the mixture this solved that problem. The other thing I change was I added half the Dijon mustard because I didn't want it to over power the mixture. The sun pattern was really easy and looked great. I used 1 ½ cans of Pillsbury rolls.

My husband LOVED this, I liked it but I thought it would be better w/ sour cream or creamed cheese instead of the mayo. I omitted the green pepper, and cooked frozen broccoli and fresh onion w/ the chicken so it would be cooked through well. I think the crescent roll wreath would be a great base for chicken fajita mixture, or a breakfast dish w/ scrambled eggs, cheese and crumbled bacon.

Love it but, I don't like baking mayonaise into anything and, I personally just don't like bell pepper. So I used greek yogurt and horseradish mustard. I Love broccoli in this but, I also made it with fresh spinach leaves, chopped. Since spinach cooks down so much, I add an extra 1/2 cup. I serve it with a heaping cup of greek yogurt to which I add 1tsp grated garlic, 1/4 tsp lemon zest. Add lemon juice and salt to taste. Also try adding a spicy cocktail sauce, or a chili sauce to the yogurt.

I made this exactly as the recipe stated, and only had 2 problems.  I did have more filling than could fit in the dough.  Luckily, I had read other reviews and bought a second can of crescent rolls, just in case.  For the extra, I tried something different.  I used a muffin tin, instead and put one triangle in each muffin "hole", then put a generous spoonful of filling in, and pulled the point of the triangle over top.  The second problem was either the temp was too high (could be my oven, but haven't noticed problems with other things) or the time was too long.  I pulled them out at 23 minutes, and they were a little more than golden brown on top, and the bottom was VERY dark.  The muffin tin ones, I only cooked for about 17 minutes, and that was about perfect.  Nonetheless, these were delicious and I will definitely make this again!  If I could give 1/2 stars, it would have gotten 4 1/2 out of 5.

This recipe was just OK for me. I just made homemade chciken broth and decided to use the chicken from that. Which was a mistake. Definetly better with chunks of chicken, sauted in some spices first.  I decreased the mayo and cheese and used reduced fat cresents. I increased the garlic and wish I had added even more and herbs (perhaps dill as in another recipe). I would also perfer to use pizza dough next time and roll it into a log like a Stromboli.

Followed the recipe exactly and it was PERFECT!  I did use reduced fat crescents and light mayo though. The family loved it and it makes a nice presentation.  I have also made this in a braid too.  Thanks for sharing!

Super easy to make and absolutely delicious. I'm from the Midwest originally, so this is my kind of food... cheese, mayo, meat.. mix it up with a bit of broccoli, wrap it in pastry, throw it in the oven - boom. Done.  

My sister was "wowed" by the presentation, and if we were not trying to set an example of self-discipline in front of my children, I think we would have snarfed the whole dang thing ourselves.  

I used canned chicken which we had in the "pantry" (our cupboard), and the only other change I made was sauteeing the onion and green pepper in olive oil, and using gouda cheese instead of cheddar. Cheddar would be awesome, I'm sure, but we had a big hunk of gouda in the fridge.  My kids were not too impressed (they're 4 years and 20 months), and didn't eat much, but I would definitely make this again. Great combination of textures and rich flavors that was perfect for a cold fall evening!

This makes ALOT of chicken mixture - so I would cut everything in half.   I left out the green peppers.   I would add more brocolli next time - it adds a lot of GREAT flavor - especially because I substituted the cheeses.   Instead of using Dijon mustard, I used regular yellow.   Also, I substituted the Cheddar cheese for mozzarella, parmesan and provolone because that's what I had on hand.   It was a delicious recipe - my 2 year old ate it right up.  I would definitely recommend the changes I made to others - it had great flavor!   LOOK AT THE PICTURES to UNDERSTAND HOW TO FORM THE CRESCENT ROLLS - much easier that way!  MMM...Thanks for the starter recipe BRENKJ.

This is an excellent recipe.  I sauted the onion and green pepper and minced garlic in a skillet.  I also used frozen broccoli the kind that comes in the steamer bags, microwaved it first. I first came across the Chicken and Broccoli Braid recipe off this site and  I followed those instructions and made the crescents into the braided design, it does make a lot of filling you need at least 2 cans of the crescents. Baked it for 25 mins, came out perfect. Before making it into the braid instead of the wreath, I did spray my cookie sheet w/cooking spray. Thank you for this great recipe took it to my nephews birthday party came back with an empty plate.  My mom has already requested I make this for Easter.

I make this recipe all the time. My is a little different. I do not add mustard but I add a few sprinkles of dill seed, which gives it a amazing taste. Go lite on the mayo, becasue you don't want to taste it. Its just to hold everything together. I grill my chicken first and add tons of bread crumbs and garlic seasoning to spice it up. This is a old pampered chef recipe that in my house is "Old Trustee"

I made some changes, and thought it was very good.  I used about 1/2 the amount of onions and green peppers (personal taste).  The biggest change was that I used wonton wrappers instead of the crescent rolls.  After stuffing the wontons, I baked them at 400 degrees for about 11 minutes (or until golden brown).  I thought the wonton wrappers gave it a nice, light flavor.  You could actually taste the filling, and it wasn't too bready.

I love this recipe, I make them for every special occasion and they seem to just disappear. However, I think using spinach instead of brocolli works better.

This was quick and easy and good.  I think I might use sour cream/cream cheese mixed instead of the mayo.  The mayo tasted just a little weird to me but it was still good and my family enjoyed it.

Very yummy! I think next time, I will steam the broccoli first.  Also, I think you need two packages of crescent rolls.  I used all the filling with the one package, but they were overflowing and you missed the flavor of the crescent rolls since they were spread so thin.  I didn't use the glass the way the recipe called for.  I just used a round pizza pan, unrolled all the rolls and laid them slightly overlapping in a small circle with the points outward.  Once the filling was piled on, I pulled the points over and tucked them in the inside of the circle.  I've made this before and it is a family favorite.  You could easily add in in different fillings to change it up (i.e. taco meat and cheese).

This dish was a big hit with my family, and was easily put together. Only thing I changed was in that, I seasoned the chicken with a good southwest spice blend before cooking. There are several good brands for this spice blend.

Very good recipe, it was nice to have something a little different for a change.  Definitely something I'll do again.  The biggest change I made was switching the mayo and mustard for 1/2 can condensed cream of broccoli soup.  I also omitted the pepper and onion and added more broccoli (my family does like broccoli).  Thanks for the recipe

Great taste! The amounts however did make MUCH more than I could stuff in the crescent rolls. I could have easily used 1 and maybe 2 more packages of rolls. One suggestion, only bake for the amount of time on the crescent roll package. The amount of time listed on the recipe is much to long, the crescents begin to burn. Another tip...I used the leftover mix as sandwiches on toast....great!

Very tasty but very confusing. Like others I used three cans of rolls. After removing the rolls from the can, I cut each in half and made smaller, appetizer-size bites. I placed the chicken mixture in the center and crossed the ends over the middle. It helps if you let the dough come to room temp. You can stretch the dough to cover the filling. Baked for 15 minutes. I never did figure out the whole wreath thing, though.

I thought this roll was good, but I made some changes.  First of all I was not interested in fussing with the crescent roll design so I picked up two containers of pillsbury pizza roll dough, put a layer of mixture on top of the pizza roll and rolled across the vertical.  If you do this, cut the cooking time down, as the bottom of my bread burnt following the recipe's time.  15 mins was sufficient for me.  Also, rather than dijon mustard, I used Gulden's spicy brown mustard and thought that added a nice pep.

I have mixed feelings about this recipe.  I ran out of time, guests were arriving, and didn't have time to mess with figuring out the pattern.  I ended up spreading some of the filling on each roll, rolling it up, and pinching the ends where filling was leaking out.  My friends weren't that impressed with the outcome, and neither was I.  The filling, however, was really good!  I ended up just putting the rest of it in a casserole dish, and baking for 25 minutes.  Wonderful served with crackers!  I still had leftovers, so I made quesadillas out of the filling (which were great!).  Forget the rolls, and go with the casserole dish and crackers if you decide to attempt this recipe.

This could have used 2 cartons of crescent rolls. I had a lot of the mixture left over. The chopping is labor intensive and I couldn't get the rolls to cooperate with the sun design. I just rolled them up on their own. Impressive for company, but I won't keep it as an everday dish. Tastes good.

Broccoli Chicken Roli Haiku: "Looked super-pretty. Red bell pepper's nice as well. Taste was kinda 'meh.'" I much prefer the taste of AR's "Broccoli Chicken Braid" to this, although the wreath presentation is much more elegant. I followed the recipe as written, and didn't encounter much trouble in having too much "filling" to accommodate 1 can of crescent rolls. Something about the taste was just off to me, and I wonder if it was the mustard, b/c I couldn't put my finger on why such tasty ingredients, all snug, warm and smooshy together inside golden crescent rolls could not inspire my family to finish our plates. Oh well, I'll go w/ the wreath design, but the "braid" recipe's filling next time!

This turned out to be very good.  I probably added too much chicken to the mixture and ended up with more filling than could be stuffed into the roll, but it was almost good enough to eat as a separate dish--a nice summer salad?  The rolling of the dough to make a shell for the chix mixture was tricky.  There didn't seem to be enough dough to cover the filling, and I had to use a second can of roll dough to fill in a few of the gaps.  Probably, again, because of too much filling.  It turned out really well, though, and my husband loved it.  It was full of healthy vegetables and a good way to get in the broccoli  Oh, I added a small can of mushrooms too.  Will definitely make again.  This first time experience, I think, will help the next time I make it.  Will go more by the exact recipe.

Easy recipe! Looked pretty as well.  Tasted very good, but a little salty.  It may be because I added a little cooked chopped sausage to the mixture, or because the crescent rolls are salty.  Either way, I will not add any extra salt next time.  I took the other reviewers advice and baked at 350 because my oven tends to run a little hot.  There was a little crunch to my veggies, but I personally do not mind that.  I had a little extra filling, but just piled it on.  I saved a couple tbsp. of the filling and used extra crescent roll dough and pressed and cut the dough until I had squares.  I put a spoonful of filling in the center of the squares, pulled the corners up and twisted to seal, then baked.  These were also very pretty and fancy looking :)  I will make this again!  Thanks for the recipe!

TIME SAVING TIP!! ( I always have trouble with the peppers being too crunchy in recipes)I cut up the pepper a week or so in advance and then put it in a zipper seal sandwich bag and froze it.  Then a few days before I made this recipe I transfered the pepper to the fridge and thawed it out.  To my surprise, the raw peppers were soft!!! I expected this flavor to be a standard cheesy chicken and broccoli taste, but WOW was I surprised when I took the first bite! The flavor had such amazing depth.  I agree with most of the reviews, this made too much filling for one tube of rolls.  This was my test run for my friends bridal shower, so the more filling the better!! Thanks for sharing and here's my two thumbs WAAAAAAY up!!

I will definitly make this again!  To simplify a bit I just made it in a basic rectangle shape and used 2 cans of croissants; 1 on the bottom, & 1 on top.  I also used 1 heaping tablespoon of horseradish-mustard, because I didn't have dijon.  This tasted great!

We had this for dinner and it went over great! First I will tell you based on my family tastes I did change a few things. First I added less Mayo and more Dijon then listed. I also added garlic, chilpolte chilli power, roasted red pepper instead of green pepper and used two tubes of cresent rolls. There was leftover filling so we put it in a small oven proof dish and covered this with a tube of biscuits. This feed 6 with a little leftover. Next time I know to use 3 tubes of cresent rolls and make two rings.

Has anyone noticed when you view the recipe the serving size is automatically set to 16?  Well either way it was delicious.

my hubby loved this and I didn't even have everything. Next time I will follow the full recipie, but for a quick meal.....a can of chicken, frozen bag of broccoli, cheese, and the mayo/mustard mixture works! I didn't use as much of the mayo mixture, but seasoned it up good to make up for the lack of ingredience and then did the wreath of cresent rolls. It was great and fast!

i didn't find this dish too difficult to prepare as some reviewers mentioned, but I rated it a 3 for a couple of other reasons.  the baking times and temperature didn't give me good results. the outside was burning and the inside was still not hot, though my oven could be to blame for that. Mainly I wasn't that impressed with the overall taste. It seems to be lacking SOMETHING. My husband and I couldn't put of finger on it, but after a serving or so it became kind of bland. I will say, however,  that it made for a very impressive looking presentation. I'm definitely going to experiment to find the pizzazz I think it needs since it's such a wow factor to bring to the table without much fuss.

I gave 4 stars because the serving size is misleading.  I think it would serve 6 dinner portions...maybe 16 slivers as an appetizer.  It was so small and fat I cant see 16 slices.  There IS alot of filling as the others posted but your can get it in.  I screwed it up and forgot the cheese so I put it on top in the last few minutes to melt....but even my picky son loved it and we ate nearly the whole thing in one sitting.  I will be surely making this again when we have leftover chicken.

I made this as tiny bites in a mini-muffin pan by cutting each crescent roll in half to make two triangles, draping those over the muffin wells.  I over-filled the crust and then folded the triangle's edges over the top.  Used all of the filling, making 32 mini-bites.  Good tasting but a little too much mayo flavor for me.  Will make again, but perhaps use 1/2 mayo, 1/2 cream cheese.

I made this recipe as written.  It was very good.  I tasted the filling "before" it was cooked, and found the dijon to be a little strong.  But, after it was cooked, it mellowed out and ended up adding great flavor.  There's too much filling to fit inside the rolled crescents (as other raters noted), but don't be afraid to let the filling spill out the sides of the crescent rolls -- it's no big deal.  The overflowing filling clings nicely to the crescents and is needed to perfect the "crescent-to-filling" ratio.

Really good recipe.  I, too, was stumped by description of pattern until I read it to my husband ("duh" slaps head ... now I get it !).  She's talking the 'pizza pattern' - use a pizza pan or clay disc, put the glass in the middle, take the dough and put the fat end up against glass with the pointy end going towards edge of pan;  Do the same thing all around the glass so you have a 'circle' of triangle shapes.  Put filling near fat part of triangle, bring tip up, over filling, and tuck underneath.  The picture is what threw me.

This receipe was great. I actually used biscuits cut in half and rolled out and the mixture amount was perfect for that. These are easier, healthier and cheaper than Hot Pockets!

I really like the concept, but I've seen similar recipes with a cream cheese type filling and I think that would taste better than the mayo. I also wasn't sure if the dijon mustard and green pepper fit.  They both sort of tasted misplaced. There was WAY, WAY, WAY too much filling for a can of crescent rolls. I don't like to waste, but even though I had another can of crescent rolls, I threw out the rest of the filling because I knew I didn't want to eat this again.  A good idea that tasted really wrong.  Sorry.

Overall this dish received rave reviews, but not everyone liked it and I didn't follow the directions for the wreath just made little pocket sandwiches. It makes a lot of filling so I used 3 pkgs. of crescent roll dough. I omitted the onion and green pepper and simply increased the broccoli. Baked for 15 minutes at 400 degrees and they were done.

I really like this recipe and if you are having a problem with making the wreath shape look at the pictures. This makes a lot of mix, I use 2 chicken breasts and usually make 3-4 cans of crescent rolls. My favorite thing about this recipe is the crunch of the vegetables, I have thought about adding a little bit of spinach for color because I am thinking about serving this Christmas Eve and I want it to have a lot of Green/Red.

Made almost exactly as written, except didn't have crescent rolls to I used biscuits. Half a recipe is the perfect amount for one can of biscuits when made this way. Pretty good as written, but my daughter thought it needed either less mayo or maybe yogurt or sour cream instead, and I thought it needed more mustard. We'll definitely make it again with a few little adjustments and some extra seasonings, or perhaps saute the onion, peppers and garlic first. Also, I'd would love to try it with the crescent rolls if I served this to guests, the presentation looks great in the photos, but for weeknight dinner I think we perfer the biscuits. We just pressed each one flat, topped with a dollop of filling, wrapped the dough up to make a ball, and then flipped them seam side down. Follow directions on biscuit can for cooking, 12 minutes at 350.They came out really cute and perfect for little hands!

LOVED this recipe.  Look at the additional photos to see what it should look like (the main photo does not do it justice).  Delicious and pretty!  The only change I made to the original recipe was to sautee the vegetables for about 5 minutes until tender before mixing with the other ingredients.  Brought it to a family gathering and everyone RAVED!

I made the filling but had to leave the house. I couldn't wait 'til I got back to eat so I filled a couple of flour torillas and heated 'em up on the stove to take in the car.  Delicious!!!  I like it better in the shells than in the crescent rolls!

These went like hotcakes at our housewarming this weekend!  Everyone loved them.  Instead of the fancy roli I just stuffed crescent rolls with the mix.  There was enough for 3 packages of rolls and I could have even done 4.

I made this years ago when I had a Pampered Chef party and forgot how good it was.  Glad I came across this recipe again.  I changed the servings to 10 and still had too much filling, I think 1/2 would probably be perfect.

The whole family loved this! This roll was a very filling 'comfort food.' I had extra filling after stuffing the first roll of crescent rolls, next time I will make two rolls using two cans of crescent dough. The dijon mustard adds a nice tang. We will be adding this to regular rotation!

This recipe is a keeper!!!  Easy to make and everyone loved it.  I followed the recipe exactly and had enough of the filling to make it twice; this made for a happy family!  You could easily omit the onions if you have a picky eater.  This also came out great when I substituted rice cheese for my milk allergy child.

Taste good easy to make. Filling is double than what is needed so cut in half.

Most are wrong about the amount of filling (the more the better). I doubled the filling and used 3 cans of cresents and it was great. Even the grandchildren ate this one. I will make again and again and share.

The recipe only called for one package of crescent rolls, but I ended up using two because there was SO much stuffing.

The crunch of the green pepper and onion, were just right for me! If you're not big on crunch, leave those out. 

This one is definitely being added to the favorite list!

This was another hit! My husband asked if I could make another one as he was practically licking his plate.  I substituted the cheddar cheese with a half jar of Ragu cheese creations and added a 1/4 cup or so of seasoned bread crumbs for the extra moisture. I also used two cans of crescent rolls as my family likes a lot of crust.  This on just got added to our monthly rotation.

This was okay. Definitely needed 2 tubes of dough.  Kids aren't huge fans of broccoli so it wasn't exactly well received. However, hubby really liked.  Will probably not make again due to the majority of my families' taste.

Would give it 10 stars if I could. Soooo good! Rave reviews in my household. Build chicken mixture up against the glass. Pack it tight. Use either one container of no fat crescent rolls and cut each one in half or use two.

Deleted mustard the 2nd time I made it, as I didn't care for the flavor. Also ... substitute herbed cream cheese for the mayo and added some chopped mushrooms for more flavor.

I wasn't sure about this recipe but ended up really liking it.   We haven't had crescent rolls in ages and it was such a treat. There is quite a bit of stuffing. Could have used less, but I ended up filling each roll quite full. It worked.  They also made nice little meals for our toddler.

Love these- little time consuming considering you have to cut up, cook the chicken, then prepare the mix.  We found the "wreath" shape too confusing, so we simplified it by putting a spoonfull of the mix inside cresecent rolls, baking 8-10 min until golden brown, and then serving as cheesy broccoli biscuits.  Big hit.  *The portions are off- the mix makes enough to use three packages of crescent rolls.

This made a great Sunday evening supper. I followed the recipe but added a sprinkle of dry ranch dressing as advised by a reviewer wanting more flavor. I also used 2 tubes of rolls.

So delicious! It's kind of similar to chicken salad, which I love, but it's got veggies in it, which is great. Of course, the crescent rolls add a lot to this recipe, but I plan to make just the filling soon and eat it by itself, since I'm supposed to minimize my carb intake and since it's just that good.

I made these for dinner tonight. They were yummy. I did modify the recipe a little. I used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 mayo. I added some bacon bits and used Puff pastry instead of the crescent rolls. Yummy!

this recipe was really good! i left out the bell pepper cause I didnt have one, and used regular mustard instead of the Dijon-style. Also, didnt understand the directions to make it into a 'sun', so instead, I used 2 packages of crescent rolls and made them like stuffed pizza slices. The first thing my 3.5 yr old said was "pizza"! Both he, my 2 yr old, & husband ate the slices up! I would definitely make again, maybe trying ham instead of the chicken.

Will try this recipe as dish to pass at our Moose lodge.  After reading the reviews it seemed that people were confused on the layout of the rolls.  If you go to photos of this recipe you will find one that shows the exact layout.  I just did a print on the photo to keep with the recipe.

Made this recipe just as directed and it was not to our liking. I was surprised because I love all the ingredients! So, thinking it was the crescents, I made it on naan bread and still did not care for the flavor. Husband and sister agree. I had fun making it at least!

I don't really like the taste of cooked mayo so I used cream cheese instead (did use a TB of mayo to thin a bit). I also didn't use the green peppers and opted for garlic powder in place of minced garlic. On accident I forgot to include the Cheddar cheese, but it didn't really need it because I was using cream cheese. This turned out really pretty and my husband and I both thought it was good. Even my boys (7 & 5) ate this. This really would make a great appetizer as it has great presentation qualities and serves many people.

This recipe is easy to make and tastes delicious! I did have too much filling, as other people had said.  I am about to make this for the second time, and will just use more crescent rolls.  I made the chicken/broccoli mixture ahead of time, and froze it in ice cube trays. That way I can take out how ever many I need, and have some left over for another time!

I give this a 3.5 stars for taste, but a 5 for presentation. (I did end up using the braided shape, but the wreath pattern was simple and I had no problem figuring out the directions.) I lightly precooked the broccoli, onion, pepper, and garlic, and I cut the mayo down to 1/4 cup and added some chopped water chestnuts for crunch along with a bit of dried dill for flavor, but it was still pretty bland tasting. Perhaps would have been better with a more pungent cheese and more spices, but I'll use this as a base for future fillings. I think I hit upon the best preparation method, though. I put a pizza stone in the oven and preheat 350 degrees. I laid out some parchment paper and prepared the dough and fillings directly on that, and when the oven was hot I just lifted the parchment paper directly onto the hot pizza stone. 30 minutes in the oven was absolutely perfect with this method - the top was golden brown and everything was cooked all the way through - and all I had to do was lift the cooked dish out of the oven by grabbing the parchment paper and set it onto a cutting board to slice and serve. I let the pizza stone cool in the oven and just take it out a few hours later. No mess, and super easy!

I made this exactly as above, and it turned out absolutely beautiful. Definitely NOT too much stuffing! I put a glass in the middle and piled it up around the sides like a wreath and then tucked in the crescent dough when i took it out, and it was perfect.  The only thing I might do different is to get two packages of crescent rolls next time to add more "sun spokes" :)  Updated: This has become a staple recipe of mine, with many variations. I generally just do 5 cups of any combo cooked veggies/meat (tonight I used broccoli, carrots, roasted red peppers, crushed red pepper, green peppers, and onions) plus the other ingredients. Tonight I substituted fat-free sour cream for the mayo, and I liked that a lot. I also spray cooking spray over the top and season the bread at the end with black pepper and garlic and sometimes paprika. Love it!!

Very Tasty and simple. Bakes in less time than suggested. At 35 minutes they were very brown. Each one has large amount of filling which is great if using for main dish. If I were using for an appetizer I would put alot less filling in. To complete the meal I made a white cream sauce using chicken broth and added mushroom to put over rolls. 
Will make again.

These were great.  I omitted the onion and garlic, used 3 cans of rolls to make 2 wreaths.  I baked them on a parchment paper covered pizza pan for about 15 minutes.  Everyone loved them.

The filling was delicious but I, too,had so much left over and was not too sure what to do with it. My daughter suggested using it in quesadillas (great idea) or on top of baked potatoes. Next time I make it I'll will definately use 2 more rolls of cresents. But they were really good.

I love this! Only I changed a few things. I used red bell pepper instead of green, that way it would be red and green for our Christmas dinner. I also omited the onion, just because I don't like them. I stuffed them and folded them like in the picture, and I did need all three packs of rolls. Baked on 375 for about 10 mins. Everyone loved them!

I should have taken others suggestions about leaving out the onions. It was too much. I did horseradish instead of mustard, gave great bite. And you should really use 2 cans crecent rolls, rolling one out, laying the mixture on top, and toping off with the other. I only baked it for 15 minutes, 25 would've burnt it. Great flavor though!!! Will make again!

These tasted good but the presentation was terrible. I had way too much filling for one package of crescent rolls. Plus they turned out really soggy - I was hoping they would be easy to pick up and eat like a sandwich but they had to be eaten with a knife and fork because they were soggy and the filling was leaking out. Will not make again.

So easy once you've figured out the wreath--looking at the pictures helped me.  According to hubs, I don't stuff things as much as I should, and I ended up with two wreaths and a braided bread.  So either this makes too much or hubs is right.  I have no idea; it's a toss up to me.  He was a bit put off by the mustard in this but still gobbled up several servings at one sitting.  I like mustard so I thought it was good.  This is very similar to the Chicken and Broccoli Braid on here, just a wreath instead.  I subbed Ranch Dressing for mayo since that's what I had.  Next time I'll put the oven down to 350; this browned very quickly and can use a lower oven temp.  Thanks for the recipe!

Amazing! Seasoned my chicken with Mrs.Dash garlic&herb while i was cooking it since i didn't have any minced garlic and also added about 2/3 of a packet of dry ranch mix. I also substituted cheddar for mozzarella. I prepared my mix and let it sit in the refrigerator for about 2 hours before i made the meal. It gave the flavor time to set and also wasn't that messy when i was putting it on the crescent rolls! I baked mine on 350 bc at 375 and 400 the outsides seemed to be cooking too fast.

1st time making Broccoli-Chicken Roli as well as using the allrecipes.com site, and I must say I enjoyed both! I followed the easy recipe pretty much to a T, I did change the green bell pepper to red(sweeter)... and added another half cup of shredded cheddar cheese(my family likes cheesy). Delicious!  We enjoyed it so much that I have referred this recipe to a friend.

My guy loved this. I used a small bag of mixed fresh vegies (cauliflower, broccoli and carrots) instead of broccoli alone.  He requested this again.  Was very quick to assemble.

This was DELICIOUS! Even though I tried, I could NOT get this wreath shape thing done at all... I basically ended up making little "pouches" of crescent dough with filling. Can't wait to make again.

My hubby and I really like this dish.  My boys didn't care for it at all so I probably won't make it again.  The only thing I thought was wrong with it was the amount of mustard.  I think 1 T would have been enough.  I used low fat mayo and crescents without any ill affects!

This was very tasty. I browned chicken breast chunks and added the veggies on top after they were browned to soften them up a bit. I look forward to mixing up what veggies to add to this. 

 If you are confused on the placement of crescent rolls, there are plenty of pictures people posted that can help you visually.

One of my all time favorite dishes! Easy to make, and most of it (all the chopping) can be done earlier, so it can get put into the oven as guests arrive, and be fresh out when ready to sit down for dinner. It's easy to do extra add in's. I usually make with chopped celery instead of bell pepper. I stuff the sun full, so it's almost overflowing and comes out great :)

This is completely delicious!  Took me a bit to figure out how to do the roll, but it is a great do-ahead with lots of drama when you serve.  Definitely needs (2) canisters of crescent rolls.

Good food. Needs more cheese. I'll cook the broccoli before hand next time. I used 2-packs of crescent rolls to cover those exposed spots. I look forward making this again. I'll update.

Very Tasty, We have found that we fill two crescent rolls not just one although this probably depends on the amount of filling you want to put in. Asa  finger food, definitely can't fit all the filling in one roll.

First of all, I forgot to buy broccoli, but I had zucchini on hand and used that successfully.  I omitted the green pepper. I have to agree with Sue9688, I thought I understood the "sun" instructions, but I just had too much filling.  With that said, I was prepared and bought two cans of crescent rolls.  There was still a lot of filling, so I filled in the center of the rings with the extra.  Wish I had remembered Sue's warning about the cooking time.  At 400 degrees, the bottom of my first Roli burned after 20 minutes.  Luckily, I had assembled the second one and put it into the oven a few mintues after the first, so I turned the oven down to 350 degrees to finish that one.  The filling is delicious.  So, having too much of the chicken mixture isn't a problem. I'll just cook it at 350 degrees next time.

This meal was ok, but my family are not really big mayo fans so maybe next time i'll put half the mayo in it and see how that goes. Also I only had to put them in for 10 mins if I left them in longer they would have burned. But it was very quick and easy and a good way to add broccoli in a meal.

This was excellent, my husband loved it. I did exactly what the receipe called for. I did pre-cook everything, then just put it together, because I had a feeling the crescent rolls would cook quickly. I will make this again, very easy and tasty.

I had saved this recipe a while ago and finally got around to making it. But, when the time came, I couldnt get on the computer to check it all out, so I just improvised. I used chopped ham from a ham steak, french-cut green beans, a small can of mushrooms, a little prepared mustard, chopped onions, and my own seasonings. I then brushed the finished product with butter, a little more seasoning, and bacon bits. I baked it about 15 minutes and it was perfect!! I wish I had made 2 because this was literally gone in less than 5 minutes. I will definitely be making this again. the possibilities are endless. I'm gonna make this tomorrow night with leftovers from Thanksgiving...YUM!!

This recipe was 5 thumbs up from the family.  Made it just as the recipe is written, but read suggestions, and bought an extra package of crescent rolls and made 2.  Both are gone.  It's a keeper

This dish was very tasty, easy too! Mine didn't  look like the description, I didn't do the glass technique and I actually made mine into pockets and just spaced them out on a baking sheet. These would be good for appys even, I will definitely make these again.

This tasted pretty good. The bottom was a little doughy on the inside. I would recommend pressing the crescents out thinner on the bottom to prevent this.

The recipe was VERY good!  The next time I make it, however, I will be sure to cut the broccoli into smaller pieces so that it will cook more thoroughly, saute the onions & peppers to draw out more flavor, and double the amount of crescent rolls to give everyone more crust.

Instead of mayo and mustard I put in a can of cream of mushroom soup.  I also laid a few leaves of spinach on the dough before putting the chicken mixture down.  This is a great recipe!

Delicious. It does make more than you need, and I put extra filing in a small casserole and sprinkled with crushed ritz crackers. Just as good the next day for lunch!

This was delicious. I tweeked it as others did, adding mushroom, parm cheese instead of cheddar, etc, and made 2 of them because there was so much leftover chicken mix. My roommate ate a whole one by himself and raved how good it was. I shared the other with my mom and granddaughter and they loved it.  Thinking of trying it with crab, or maybe ham & swiss. Yum!

Delicious!  I was looking for somethink i could use for "finger" foodd, so made them into little packets by folding the crescent roll dough around the filling.  It worked beautifully!  I sauted the onion & broccoli along with some chopped mushrooms and then wilted some spinach in.  SOOOOO GOOD!!!

Was teaching a scrapbboking class last evening and served these as an appetizer. They were delicious and everyone loves them! Sure didn't last long:) I adjusted the recipe a little, using a cream cheese and sour cream mixture instead of mayo, didn't add the peppers and added some ranch seasoning...after they were baked, I brushed them with a butter and parsley mixture for a finishing touch. Hubby said they were the best appetizer I've made yet!

Easy and delicious!  If some of the other folks who reviewed this recipe would look at the picture, maybe they'd see that the crescent rolls aren't supposed to completely cover the filling.  It's really not that complicated.  The 2nd time I  made even more filling than the recipe called for because it's sooo good, and it still turned out great.  Thanks for one of my new favorite foods.

This was an amazing dish!!!  I love how flavorful it is!  Definitely a hit!  I did not cook it for the entire time though - I think we took it out of the oven 5 minutes before the timer went off, but it was cooked perfectly:)

This was a very good and easy recipe.  I used a rotisserie chicken, and I sauteed the broccoli, onion, bell pepper, and garlic first.  Then I added cream cheese instead of mayo.  It was so good!  I would definately make it again.  For a dinner item, it feeds 3, for an appetizer a little more.  You would need to make 2 for a family dinner.

I thought this was good for the little effort.  I used ham instead of chicken and cooked for 15 minutes at 350.  Plenty done at that time and temp.  Four year old loved it.  Husband wasn't as big of a fan, but it's a decent, veggie packed, quick and easy dinner for a weeknight.

The filing is great, but the instructions for creating the star are very poor. Maybe I am dense by I don't see how rolling out the entire roll as one piece will make a star.  Would love to make it the way intended  Rate 3 for poor instructions

Did this using homemade biscuit dough in place of the crescent rolls. Also used red onions. We liked it. DH said, and I quote, "Pretty good, Hezzy."

My husband is not a fan of “mixing food” so we had a side of broccoli instead of putting it in. I also left out the onion and bell pepper. It was still such a great dish!! Love how the mayo and cheese made it gooey. Recently I have been adding packaged ranch mix to a few dishes so I think it will try adding a little of that seasoning to this.  It’s a keeper!!

This was pretty good, the hubby and I liked it and the kids, well, they didn't care for it.  I ended up using two packages of crescent rolls to cover all of the chicken mixture.  I'm not sure if I'll try this one again.

So yummy and the star roli pattern was very easy and the stuffing didn't leak out even though there were openings in the roli.  Beautiful presentation and I used 1.5x the ingredients for the mixture and it STUFFED 2 cans of crescent rolls... trust me you'll want to make 2 because this went so quickly.

This was quick and easy and my kids loved it.   I had to omit the onions and peppers beacuse my son hates them so I just added a little more broccoli to compensate. Next time I will make 2, one for adults with onions & peppers and 1 for kids. I did find that the crust tasted overcooked so next time I will adjust the temp and cooking time.   My son suggested to add bacon so I'll try that next time

I made this by making rolls on my own, and they weren't crescent rolls because they don't sell them where I live. I didn't make the sun, but just covered the mixture. My boyfriend and I loved it! It came out very, very good. I plan to make it again! :) Happy New Year!

this roll up is totally tasty.  I did use 4 packs of crescent rolls and made 2 suns. Perfect amount of filling for 2.   Added extra broccoli.  Husband wouldnt let me eat  any of the leftovers because he wanted them for himself.  Great recipe used as a main dish.

Super easy and quick for a weeknight dinner.  Used one package of crescent rolls and had half the filling leftover though.  Just enough to feed all of us with no leftovers.  Definitely will make this again!

A great and delicious recipe. Very easy to make if you look at the pictures provided. The only problem is that it makes less than 16 portions.

This was wonderful!!  I took the advise from 'Mom of Two' and sauted the onion, bell pepper and minced garlic and made it into the braid instead of the circle.  The mix was good for two packages of big and flakey cresent rolls.  Awesome recipe, tastes good and not too difficult to make.  Thanks so much for sharing this!

My rating scale (cause number of stars is subjective): 1-Didn't like it, 2-It's okay, 3-Liked it, 4-Loved it, 5-Can't get enough of it.

I made this as a braid style - it turned out even tastier than it looked. My husband thought I went to a lot of work when actually, it took very little time at all thanks to the crescent rolls.

Tastes excellent, however there is more filling than needed.  I cut the filling in half, and used 2 rolls of cresent rolls.  I made little pockets instead of the loaf or whatever the wreath design thing.

Great recipe.  Makes a bit too much filling. The cooking time is closer to 15-20 minutes.  Also, try adding bacon to the mix.  Delicious!

I also had trouble with the directions on getting it into a roll shape, but eventually just did it my own way that was very successful. The mix was great, since I don't like mayonnaise very much I cut it down and added more mustard. Loved it! It looks very nice coming out of the oven, too. A big hit!

I have made this many times and everyone loves it.  When I am in a hurry, I just press the cresent rolls onto a cookie sheet and make a pizza out of it.  I also use frozen (thawed) spinach or aparagus instead of broccoli to change things up a bit.  It is great all ways!

I had just enough filling - I think the trick was compressing it some by scooping it with a measuring cup and pressing it a bit before putting it on the dough.  Taste was very good and the veggies were crisp-tender. My husband had the two pieces leftover for lunch the next day, then called me at work to tell me he had a "happy tummy". NOT something he would ever say.  Next time I'm trying it with leftover ham!

This really would have been best for an appetizer with friends, but I made it as a main course for my husband and our small children. I ended up pulling the pretty thing out of the oven just to cut it up before anyone could oooh or ahhh.

Like everyone else that reviewed this, I thought it was way too much filling.  Then I went back to the picture and counted the number of crescent rolls wrapped around it. There were 16...then I looked at "calculate" and it was set on 16.  Daah!  This time I made 2 smaller ones and they were great.  Next time I'll try making a large one with 2 cans of crescent rolls.  You really need to spray the foil lightly so it doesn't stick and I had to reduce the oven temperature to keep it from burning.  I think 375 should be about right.  It is a great tasting recipe and I had no trouble at all following the direction on the crescent rolls.

The IDEA of this recipe is great!!  HOWEVER, I cooked it in the oven according to the directions on the crescent rolls (or else they would have burned if I had followed the oven directions of this recipe).  In the end, the veggies weren't cooked (still very crisp and I like slightly crisp veggies but these were still almost raw).  And I couldn't get the crescret roll to completely cooked.  After I had dished it out and we all tried it and decided it was bad, bad, bad I figured what the heck....I threw it back in the oven at 400 for almost 10 mins.  The tops of the crescents were almost black but the inside of the wreath was still kinda doughy.

Made them for my ladies group...they loved them and so did my family with the left overs.  You definately need 3 pkg of crescent rolls...and I really piled the filling into them.  Very easy and very good..will definately make again.

The chicken and broccoli mixture was soo yummy! A great combination alltogether. One thing i noticed was that you definately need double the pasty rolls. I only used about 2/3rds of the mixture, and the rolls were packed!! I froze the rest though, and it was just as good the next week when i defrosted it and stuffed it in a pita with some grated cheddar for lunch.

Made this and b/f gave it a 4 out of 5 .. said it could use some sauce/gravy.. I gave it a 3 out of 5 I don't like bellpepper so it was a little much for me.... next time we will cook it without bellpepper and also add mushrooms.... suggesst something like a cheesy topping ...it was good and had plenty of leftovers.

To make all that and then just wrap them in cresent rolls diminishes the flavor a bit, and adds an insane amount of unnecessary carbohydrates. However, if you were starving, these are fast and filling. I used pepperjack instead of cheddar.

My family liked it, but it was ok to me. I didn’t like the Dijon mustard taste. If I make this again, I will eliminate that ingredient. Otherwise, full of flavor and not bland at all. In fact, I liked it just as the mixture. Crescent rolls weren’t necessary for me.

I read the other reviews and decided to add one packet of Ranch Dressing to add more flavor - it may have made it a little salty for my liking.  I checked the temperature as suggested and lowered it to 350 as the crescents were browning too fast.  Next time will use flowerets only - no stems.   Otherwise very good.

Tasty, but the onions did not cook as thoroughly as I would like.   Also,  the food stuck to the unsprayed foil.  Next time I'll try onion powder and just spray the baking sheet.  I used frozen broccoli that I microwaved before mixing with the other ingredients.

I loved it.  It does make good size portions, but I just shared with my neighbors.  It is one that you can easily adjust to your taste and available/lack of ingredients.  If you think you’ll have problems with the dough, watch the video.

I had to use the crescent roll dough like a pot pie because it came out of the can in pieces, but the overall taste was really good.  I cooked it about 10 minutes longer than the recipe stated.

I made a Christmas wreath with this recipe. Brushed olive oil over it, sprinkled it with chopped chives and sesame seeds before baking. it was very tasty!

I usually try to follow the recipe the first time before adapting, but this time I couldn't help myself.  I had chicken, broccoli, yellow bell pepper, shredded Italian cheese mix and half of a baked sweet potato and some cherry tomatoes on hand as left overs.  I chopped everything and used it.  It seemed like a lot, but I patted it down before wrapping the star points around.  I skipped the mustard and used the remainder of some alfredo sauce which I heated, for dipping.  This was a fun way to use leftovers for a dinner meal.  I love having methods that are so easily adaptable to preferences and ingredients already in the pantry or frig.  Will definitely use this technique more often.

I didn't make any changes, it was really pretty good. Ate as a main dish, wouldn't have made 16 servings. My husband really liked it. Will make again.

I have made a recipe like this for years but I do use 2 tubes of crescent rolls and bake it on my baking stone. If you use red bell pepper and broccoli it really does look like a Christmas wreath with the red and green peeking out between the crescent crust.

From the photo, I thought it was going to be involved to make this but the written instructions revealed how easy and simple this recipe actually is! It was also scrumptious and I’ll be making it again - and again...

I don't know about anyone else, but this made so much chicken mixture that I could have made two of these. In any case, it was quite good. I ended up serving the rest of the chicken mixture over pasta another night and it worked well.

This was great....but WAYYY too much filling!  I used 2 cups of fresh steamed broccoli and a mixture of cream cheese and mayo, omitting the mustard.  I didn't do a sun pattern, simply because I have smaller baking dishes and they wouldn't all fit in that pattern.  The leftovers I put in a cake pan and baked until melted.  I don't know which way the family enjoyed more.  This would make a FABULOUS dish with a full block of cream cheese!  I'm bookmarking this as an appetizer and as a dip for my next party!

This was pretty good. I want to give it 3.5 stars. My husband and my 16 month old liked it. I will probably make this again, but I might alter the mayonnaise, dijon mustard combo next time. There was a lingering after taste that I think could be improved. Maybe less of both mayo and dijon. Adding a little bit of plain greek yogurt might help.

My kids LOVED this.  I sautéed the garlic and onion in a bit of olive oil and steamed the broccoli before baking to make sure everything was soft enough for toddler consumption. I used two packages of crescent rolls, which nearly covered the entire ring, but assured there wasn't too much filling. I also drizzled the top with butter and sprinkled with grated Parmesan.

I love this recipe!  I made this for our Labor Day picnic and it was gone before I knew it.  The only change I made was I used a dry rub on my chicken before I cooked it which made the whole dish taste even better.  I also used two tubes of the bigger cresecent rolls since a lot of reviews stated there would be too much filling left over.  I did have a small amout of filling leftover, but I just filled the leftover cresecent rolls I didn't use.  I will be making this again.

Agree with most reviews. The filling is too much for one crescent roll. I used 2 rolls for the filling recipe. 400 degree would burn the roli. I followed the crescent direction which is 375 for 15 mins. Turned out great.

Added some paprika when cooking the chicken, I would use less dijon next time.  Didn't have any peppers, I think some red pepper would have made it even better.  I used frozen broccoli that I steamed first, and that worked pretty well but I wish I would have had fresh.  Baked at 350 for 20 min (which was perfect) because I don't like my crescents too brown.

Easy and it was a hit, even with my two little ones.  The filling makes enough for two, so either 1/2 the recipe or save it for another roll.

This turned out fantastic!! I did have trouble using all the filling with one thing of crescent rolls... So I saved the filling in the refrigerator and made it a few days later; just as good as the first time! Next time I make it, however, I will cook the broccoli first, I don't like it to be crunchy, but it was still good. Also, my boyfriend didn't care much for the amount of garlic in the recipe, but I thought it was fine! :) Thanks for the delicious and quick recipe!

Good recipe, but I would add VERY LITTLE Dijon mustard. The amount called for in the recipe was overwhelming (why I gave it a 4 and not 5 stars). Other then that is was YUMMY!

I loved the idea of this, but the flavors where just to strong and not complementing as written.  I would definitly try this again but 'tweek' the filling.

Everyone that had this thought it was awesome.  I can't understand how anyone thought this was bland.  I think the difference is that you must use freshly minced garlic and fresh cut onion.  I did add a little sour cream just to help get the mixture good and moist.  I also added about an extra cup of cheese - b/c I love cheese. Very yummy dish, I'll definitely make it again.

This was really pretty LOOKING (I used two cans of crescent rolls as some other people suggested and it was perfect).  HOWEVER the flavors were VERY strong.  Between the mustard, garlic & onions this would only be for people who like those strong flavors.

The bottoms of my crescents wouldn't cook when rolled up as directed...next time I will put the filling in the bottom of a baking dish and lay the crescents flat on top...like a pie crust.  And I will use a tad less mayo.  VERY tasty & easy!

I made this for dinner last night.  It was very good and fairly easy to slap together.  The next time I make it I will definetly 1/2 the ingredients.  There was WAY too much filling.  I even used two tubes of crescent rolls and still had left over filling!

Made this tonight for dinner.  I thought it would be really good with the high reviews, it tasted just ok for the husband and I but kids wouldn't touch it.  I guess it would be more suitable for people who like Casserole/Hot Dishes but we prefer recipes made entirely from scratch.  The cresant rolls give it that hot dish taste.

I followed the recipe exactly. It's a very easy dish to make that is tasty and comes out looking great.  Due to it's heaviness, I would personally put it in the main dish category instead of appetizer.  The only issue with the ingredients is that you need 2 cans of crescent rolls for the amount of mix that is stated.  I was left with half of the ingredients left over.  Plus, 16 servings seems unrealistic. Each crescent roll may feed about 4-6 people.  Tips: Use the pictures as a guide. I packed the mixture firmly against the glass, and when I removed the glass, it stayed intact.

I loved this! It was easy to make- I had no problem with the "sun" shape. My youngest loved it... oldest not so much, but he's extremely picky. I think this will be repeated in our house. :)

The filling alone is good! I bought 2 cans of cresent rolls because most reviews said they had plenty left over and I'm glad I did, had just enough filling for dough. I really liked these and will definately make again!

OMG DELICIOUS!!   My only thought is, you could make two w/ the amount of filling this makes so I'd have 2 cans of crescent roll dough on hand!  Going out to buy another can so I can make another!!!

Made these for our family Super Bowl gathering and I really wanted to make the sun pattern but I was intimidated by it so I made individual pastries.  I did have lots of filling and used 3 and 1/2 (8 crescent roll pkg) cans of crescents.  They were very good and almost everyone loved them except for my youngest son who most recently developed an allergy to broccoli (-;  The only change I made was to substitute diced jicama for the bell pepper because no one likes bell pepper in this house.  I will upload a picture later.  I will make them again.

hmmm, I attempted this to bring along to my sister's house for an appetizer on x-mas day. as others posted, I couldn't figure out the arrangement using the bowl in the middle, so I just made individual figure apps w/the rolls & filling- many remarked how good it was, great side dish or app for a party, perhaps the poster can explain the bowl/arrangement configuration a little more....

I gave this five stars because my boyfriend ate it and said it was pretty good and he won't try anything new or anything with brocolli. I used two cans of rolls because there was tons of exposed fillings with only one can, I also used the low fat cresents, and I put one down in the middle where the glass circle was as I did not understand how to leave it out as all of the filling would be baking on top of the foil and probably burning? I did not use the dijon mustard and I sprinkled  just a tad of parmasan/garlic butter on outside of rolls. The only thing I did not like was the onion/green pepper. I microwaved mine for two minutes before adding as others said these were uncooked before rolls were done, but the onion and green pepper stood out too much for me, and this is weird cause I put them in everything.. But I think it might taste better without them.

It was reallllly nice and tasty! I too had way too much mix left over and couldn't master the sun, so baked it in in a roll, similar to the main photo. I bought another package of crescent rolls and made the individual ones as well. I did this for a bridal shower I was hosting. Everyone loved it!

The instructions on how to assemble this made no sense to me- or my brother, both of my sisters-in-law, my mother-in-law or my brother's best friend.  We did our best, but it was pretty decrepid looking.  I wanted to make two, but doubling the recipe gave me more than twice the filling I needed- maybe going back to not having assembled it correctly.  I might m ake this again because the flavor was good, but I need figure out the directions.

Not crazy about the mustard/mayo so the cream of chicken or cream of broccoli soup sounds like a good idea.

The filling is very tasty!  I did have almost half of it left over.  If I packed any more into the roll, I didn't think it would heat through and would have made for a very messy presentation. I plan to eat the leftover filling heated up on buns.  You could easily halve the filling, or make two rings.

Absolutely gorgeous when done. I don't like mayo and mustard, so I use cream of chicken or broccoli. A home run everytime I have made it. Thanks for the great recipe.

I was not impressed at all with the end result of this recipe.  I followed the directions to a T.  It smelled really good cooking and looked wonderful, but the taste was lacking.  I do like the idea of using cresent rolls to make a ring, but next time i will try a different filling.

Was very good, but I couldn't get it shaped right. I ended up filling individual crescent rolls with the mixture. I did not use green pepper. The kids loved it.

Loved it!  I ended up with more filling than the dough could contain.  I'll have to make less next time..

Delicious!  This was fantastic.  It was slightly more difficult to make than I anticipated but well worth it. Mine did not come out pretty like the picture but it tasted great.

Just okay; I'm a novice so the whole "wreath" thing didn't come out as nicely as I would have liked (I used reduced-fat crescent rolls).  Everyone else was correct; I had WAY too much filling.  Very good but not a complete 5-star, out of the park home-run.

i would rate this 10 stars, but i've made tons of changes... I'm sure that the original recipe is delicious, but my mom is such a picky eater that i'm continually forced to change something. Well.... hmm.... actually this time i've changed almost everything, hehe. I first substituted the same amount of spinach for the broccoli (personal preference), and cooked shrimp for the chicken (you'll never see a tiny bit of chicken going into my mom's mouth). Also added imitation crabmeat to give it more flavor. Reduced the amount of mayo (just 3 tablespoons) and mustard (2 teaspoons....I don't like mustard). I couldn't find refrigerated crescent rolls in my city, so i used... hehe, well... now my several limitations want to take part in this, i don't know how to translate it, maybe "pie crust"?? i have no idea, if someone speaks Spanish and wants to know it, i used "pasta/masa quebrada". Thanx for the recipe!!

This was a delicious recipe. Like the other reviewers said, one can of cresent rolls is not enough. Three cans should be sufficient. I didn't do the design but the prep work took about 30 mins. I would recommend anyone to try this :)

This recipe was great and it was good reheated.  Next time I will try more mustard and less mayo to cut down on the fat.  I will also use a little less cheese.  There is definitely too much filling but it worked for me to use 16 crescent rolls with these portions.

Really, really good!  I followed the recipe exactly and ended up using 3 packages of crescent rolls to use up all the filling.
