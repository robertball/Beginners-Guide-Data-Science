My entire family enjoyed this, even my 8-year old daughter who rarely eats anything new.  To eliminate the problem several reviewers mentioned of the sauce burning in the bottom of the baking dish, I put it in a separate bowl and dipped the chicken in that.  I used a tablespoon each of regular soy sauce and low-sodium teriyaki sauce, and added a shake or two of garlic powder to that.  I didn't use salt or pepper in the flour/sesame seed mixture.  When I basted the chicken about halfway through baking, I DID add a couple of shakes of the teriyaki sauce to the pan, mixed it with the butter and spooned that over the chicken.  I baked this for 30 minutes only and it was perfectly done, and the sauce didn't have time to burn since I added it halfway through.  Yummy!

I love reading everyone's reviews and getting ideas of how to improvise and modify recipes to get the taste you like best! I used this recipe as my basic guide and did the following: 1.Marinated small pieces ofboneless chicken breasts in a combo of soy, teriyaki, and thick maple syrup. 2.Coated the chicken pieces with the flour, pepper, sesame seed mixturs. 3.Browned the chicken pieces in a little sesame oil. 4.Added more soy, teriyaki, sesame seeds and maple syrup to the frying pan and cooked slowly until the chicken was done and the sauce was nice and thick and sticky. My husband and I loved this and thought it was very close to chinese restaurant sesame chicken.

I followed previous reviewers' advice and doubled the mixture for the coating, which was just enough for 4 chicken breasts.

Very easy and flavorful. I omitted the butter for less fat, and after 15 minutes of cooking, added about 1/2 cup water to the pan because the soy sauce started burning. It was done in about 28 minutes. Next time, I will double the coating ingredients - barely enough for 3 breasts, and it calls for 4. I served it with carrot rice (also found on this site) and green peas - great combination! Thanks for the recipe!

Everyone must try this one.  It is the best chicken recipe ever.  I don't add the salt or pepper though, and it still tastes great.  Toasting the seeds beforehad is a must for maximum flavor. The chicken is always very moist.  So easy to make.

Great - easy, simple and tasty. And quick, too!
Just one suggestion - using just soy sauce makes it too salty. Add some duck sauce or sweet-and-sour sauce (about 1/3 amount of soy sauce) to increase the taste. 
Sesame seeds can be purchased toasted from the Oriental food market. If there are none in your area, toast on the stove in the frying pan but STIR CONSTANTLY; once the seeds start changing yellowish, switch the heat off under the pan, but KEEP STIRRING - the pan will hold enough heat to finish toasting.

I really liked this recipe.  It was extremely easy to make.  I did think it was a bit too salty.  My daughter thought it was salty too, but my son thought it was great.  My son thought it should get higher than five stars!!  Next time, I will leave out the salt.  I will definitely make it again.

This recipe had it's share of problems. It also had it share of joys. The mixture was NOT enough to coat maybe even 4 breasts..by the third, I had to scrounge of every last bit. I constantly had to add flour and other ingedients to make it through. You also needed to add more soy sauce to the bottom of the pan. It was a bit dry, the funny thing is my dad liked it and I did not! Overall, I think that I will possibly try it again, and will definately add more things to it.
This is a good "mess with" recipe...and that is all that it is good for at this point. 
Suggestion: Try some slices of green pepper on top...do not make this recipe the way that it is noted...you may not like it as well...definatley double even triple on the ingredients!!!

This was a great concept, but seemed to be lacking a couple of things. I added some sugar, garlic and oyster sauce to the soy sauce mixture. That really put it over the top. Thanks for the good, low fat recipe!

YUM!  I made this, true to recipe, and it was PERFECT.  Not floury, not soggy.  I don't know what some people did to this recipe that it didn't turn out!?  My husband and I just love it. The only substitution I made was Braggs Amino instead of Soy-and it was great. A keeper!

Being worried about the salty taste of the soy sauce, I took some advice from others who had tried this recipe. I added a container of sweet and sour I had in the fridge from McDonalds and about 3 or 4 teaspoons of Mrs. Butterworth to the soy sauce.  To the sesame seed mixture I added a teaspoon of garlic powder and left out the salt.  But as others had found you'll need to double the mixture to have enough to coat the chicken.  I cut the breasts into strips and ran each one though beaten egg before the soy sauce mixture, then dredged it through the sesame seed mixture.  I also sprinkled more sesame seeds on top before putting it into the oven.  I flipped the chicken halfway through cooking, it was moist and perfectly seasoned.  A new favorite!!

Really, really good.  I altered this recipe a bit, though.  I added 1 T. garlic and 1/2 T. sweet/sour sauce to the soy in the pan.  I also dredged the chicken through plain flour, then dredged through 2 beaten eggs, then through the flour/sesame mixture given in the original recipe.  The results were fabulous!

This was good, but not spectacular.  As others suggested I did not use the salt and pepper in the flour.  I also found that there was barely enough flour for two large chicken breats.  I don't see how it would ever cover four.  I used 1 T of soy and 1 T of sesame teriyaki sauce.  There was really only a hint of flavor.  I ended up cooking my chicken for the full 40 minutes, but I started checking it with an instant read thermometer at about 25 minutes.  I did not bake my chicken in the soy/teriyaki mix either since so many complained of burning and I was not comfortable using sauce I had put raw chicken in to baste.  I ended up using the left overs for a Chinese chicken salad and it was really good in that.

This was nothing like any Sesame Chicken I have ever had. I mean that in the worst sense. It tasted ok but definitly not what we were expecting. My daughter wouldn't touch it. Left overs were thrown away. Won't make this one again.

The only change is that I put the chicken under the broiler for a minute or two so that it would crisp up a bit more.

I'm giving this a 3 because of the differences in tastes in my family.  I hated this.  I ate one bite and just didn't like it.  My son and fiance loved it, however.  I will make it again for them.

Pretty good :D We used skinned chicken breast and thigh instead of just the breasts and we ended up quadrupling the amount of soy sauce, sesame seeds, flour, etc.  We also cut it up into strips and baked for about 15 minutes.  THe chicken turned out moist and delicious, but a little too salty on the smaller strips.  We're trying to figure out how to make it more crispy...probably add more butter.  We'll probably make it again for a potluck.
Note: it would be a good idea to grease the pan b/c the chicken will stick!

I'm so sorry to rate this recipe with two stars. I gave it 2*, because it was very easy to make, but at the end, neither my husband or me liked the flavor at all. I served it with ceasar salad, and ended adding the dressing to the chicken to give it some flavor. Sorry.

Good recipe.  Easy, quick preparation.  I cut the chicken breasts into "fingers" and cut the baking time to 20 minutes.  This eliminated the burning that can occur at the high oven heat.  Also, I left out the salt due to several reviewers stating recipe was too salty as written. Both my husband and I liked this recipe very much, and I am certain I will make again. Thx for the post Loll!

This was pretty good.  I added Sesame Oil, Garlic Powder, Maple Syrup, Ginger, and some other spices to liven it up a bit.  My chicken breasts were big, so I had to make a bit more of the coating.  I did have to add about 1/2 cup of water 10 minutes into baking because the bottom of the chicken was going to stick and burn to the dish, otherwise.  My husband said it needed more garlic, so next time we'll probably use fresh cloves.  Good idea for a recipe, it just needs spiced up a bit!

This recipe was great!  I always use low sodium soy and it was definitely a help based on other reviews.  I added more soy to the pan, which was needed and I doubled the recipe and used boneless chicken thighs along with the breasts.  The family loved it!

Came out delicious. Was a little on the dry side, but marinading longer and more basting would have helped that I think. Thanks! Will definitely make this again.

Sure, it's chicken and it also contains sesame seeds - but let's face it: this is NOT what you'd think of as sesame chicken (unless you've never stepped foot in a Chinese restaurant).  For one, it's baked (sesame chicken is fried), and two it's just coated in soy sauce (sesame chicken has a thick, red, slightly sweet sauce).  Save yourself some effort and just order Chinese take-out -- it's SO much better!

The recipe and reviews sounded great and I cook ALL the time, but this recipe wasn't that great.  I imagine it would be MUCH better if it was redipped in the soy sauce after dredging through the flour mixture and then sauteed in a pan not baked - it really dried out the chicken.  I will try that next time.

This meal was extremly salty.  If I cooked it again, I would leave out the extra salt and just use soy sauce.

We loved this.  My daughter, who didn't want any ate 2 chicken breasts.  Next time I'll bake it on parchment paper to avoid losing all the coating to the bottom of the pan.

First of all, I'm a guy: No cooking comes easy. That said, it was easy for me to follow the recipe and it came out great. The only thing knocking it down from five stars was that I used four prepackaged fresh chicken breasts and pounded them out. After I did that, there wasn't enough of the sesame coating for all four breasts. I'd say make about half again as much of the coating.

I found this recipe one evening when I wanted a change from the normal old "chicken night".  It was pretty good, but I think when I make it again, I may add some teriaki sauce to the soy before dipping the chicken.  It may give it that extra little kick it was lacking.  Great idea, though -- I'll definitely take off with this one!

I omitted the soy sauce and instead, marinated the chicken in 1/2 cup Ken's Steak House Teriyaki Marinade & Sauce.  I melted the butter in the 9 x 13 pan to coat the bottom and prevent sticking.  After discarding the marinade, I coated the chicken with the sesame seed/flour mixture and placed in the pan.  I basted the chicken about halfway through with additional teriyaki sauce.  30 minutes at 400 degrees was perfect.  It was delicious!  I served it with Green Beans Amandine from this website and Uncle Ben's Long Grain & Wild Rice cooked in chicken broth with a few craisins tossed in near the end of cooking.

not a WHOLE lot of flavor, but easy enough for something different to do with chicken.  Will be making again, maybe adding some more garlic or some thai seasonings to give it a little kick.

Made this today, substituting panko crumbs instead of the flour...and I used frozen chicken breasts.  My husband said it had a really good flavor and the chicken was juicy. I added pineapple juice & chunks.  He loves Chinese food, so I was glad to find this baked version of one of his favorite dishes!  Will make again for sure.

This is very tasty...we loved it.  Coating mixture does need to be doubled.  A tip to prevent the sauce from burning is to spray the dish with oil, add more soy sauce to the dish when basting, and cover lightly with foil after the basting.  I also reduced the cooking time to 30-35 mins.

Easy, delicious and healthy. What more could a gal ask for? Btw, I substituted the butter with pure sesame oil for a more intense flavor.

I have used this recipe many times for family and friends. Everyone raves at how good it is. I do use a little more flour and toasted sesame seeds than what the recipe calls for. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

This was a wonderful recipe!  Very flavourful with the sesame seeds and soy sauce, although I had to double the recipe for the amount of chicken so there would be enough to coat each one to allow the flavour to come through.  I'll definitely be making this one again, it smelled divine!

My husband was skeptical when it came out of the oven but wasted no time in devouring it. The chicken was nice and moist and had a terrific flavor. This recipe will definitely get a second chance in my house, but next time I think I would increase the soy sauce, butter, and amount of flour.

This was really quick and flavorful.  I added some crushed garlic, honey and sesame oil to the soy sauce to give it more flavor.  I would make a little extra sauce to pour over the chicken halfway through baking next time.  Will definitely make again.

i used a sauce called "fish and things teriyaki marinade" by jill on this site instead of soy sauce.  I coated the chicken with the flour mix and seeds and then sauce.  i stir fried instead of baking and added more sesame seeds on top.  it was delicious!

My family loves the sweet sesame chicken that you get at Chinese restaurants, so I mixed about 1/3 cup duck sauce with the soy sauce before dredging in the sesame seed/flour mixture.  (The stickiness made the chicken really hard to coat.)  The chicken came out nice and tender and had a pretty good flavor, but it's not anything like the restaurant chicken.

This was so good that my boyfriend asked me to make it again a week after the first time we had it!  I made a few modifications, based in part on what others had said.  It was really salty the first time, even though I used some teriyaki in addition to the soy sauce.  The second time I used more teriyaki than soy, and added a bit of maple syrup and it was fantastic!  I added some more teriyaki and syrup when I basted, too, because there isn't enough liquid to baste it fully.  I served it with steamed broccoli and couscous -- yum!!!

Reviewers are right about the lack of liquid.  It is still good -especially left over.  I'll make again and adjust.  Maybe cut up chicken and stirfry in same sauce on stove.  This recipe is close to being great, but not there yet.

After combining the ingredients, I did not have enough to cover 4 boneless chicken breats. The flavor was not there with just the ingredients listed. I would not recommend this recipe unless you double the amount listed.

Following the advice of other reviewers, I let chicken sit in soy sauce a few minutes, doubled the seeds/flour and shook the chicken in a bag after removing from soy.  Placed on a foil lined cookie sheet (no soy) since I was using thinner chicken tenders.  Baked at 375 and turned after about 20 minutes - EXCELLENT!!  We had the leftovers for lunch and they were still great.  Thanks for sharing.

I made this recipe exactly as the directions stated and it was fabulous! My husband and I were both really impressed. I didn't find it too salty, but for those watching their sodium intake, you could substitute regular soy sauce for low sodium soy sauce. Also, I read a review that complained that the sesame/flour/salt mixture didn't cover all the pieces of chicken. I'm fairly certain that this person misread the directions as the recipe only calls for two chicken breasts cut in HALF--not four full breasts. The dry mix was exactly the right amount.

I really like this chicken! It was quick and easy. I used chicken breast pieces, but I added more soy sauce, because it seemed it lacked liquid. It was tasty and great with rice and steamed veggies. I love the texture the sesame gives the chicken. My 3 year which is a picky eater ate his plate and loved it! THanks!

I added teriyaki, oyster sauce, maple syrup, minced fresh garlic and soy for sauce.  Poored on when chicken just about done. Tenderized chicken, then cut in strips. Made carrot, ginger rice as recommended, turned out great!! Yummy! Used recipe from this site for a lite vinaigrette salad dressing, with fresh spinach and then threw mandarin oranges on top.

Really liked this recipe, it kept the chicken super moist, and had a great flavor. The only thing I added was a little bit of sesame oil, mixed with the soy sauce, but otherwise, followed it exactly. Will make again!

Ummm... I doctored this up big time and it was pretty bland, so I can't imagine the original recipe being any better.  I marinated in a mixture of soy, teriyaki, and sesame oil.  Coated in flour, sesame seeds, garlic powder, and ginger.  Included sesame oil in the melted butter and baked 30 minutes.  It was just ok.  I found it much better when I drizzled honey on top of it.

Very good recipe.  We made it the first time exactly as written and agree with the others that it was very bland. So  this time, we cut the breasts into cubes; added 1/4 tsp roasted garlic seasoning (Tones)to the dry mixture; added 1 clove of minced garlic and 1/4 tsp fresh grated (or minced) ginger root to the soy sauce mixture. We then coated the chicken with the soy sauce and added it to a zip top baggie which had the dried ingredients in it and "shaked and baked....and I helped".  We then poured entire bag contents back into the baking dish and cooked for 30 minutes only.  The results were excellent. The chicken was moist, well seasoned and not overpowered by any one flavor. We serve it over a balsamic rice (which you can cook while the chicken is in the oven.) Doing it this way will definitely make this a keeper.

We have been making this one for several years now, it is a standard dinner item.  Usually leave out the salt but other than that, the recipe is perfect as is.

I'm trying to teach my stepsons how to cook, so tonight the 13-year-old made this dish, and it turned out so well.  We did make one change - and it's only because we read the directions wrong!  We accidentally added the butter to the dry mix for the dredging.  And it seemed dry so we added another tablespoon of butter.  But it came out great, so i think we'll keep it that way when we make it again in the future.  Which we will, for sure!  We served with a side of fried rice.  (Oh - and we use low-sodium soy sauce.)

Try marinating the chicken in soy sauce first. Very good over all!

just a little too salty for me between the butter and soy- I think adding a little brown sugar or honey to the soy before wetting would help it be more traditionally sesame chicken.  Great idea though and super easy:)

This recipe was so yummy and really easy.  My whole family loved it!  If you have a meat thermometer I would use it.  The chicken was actually done 17 minuets earlier than the recipe called for, so it was nice and juicy.

This was okay.  Tasted like it was missing something.  Probably because I make a sesame pecan chicken that has paprika in it, and it's so good that this recipe doesn't compare.  I won't make this one again.

Sorry, but I did not like this recipe.  Don't know if my sesame seeds were old, but it didn't enhance the taste of the chicken like I thought it would.  Also, I could taste too much of the flour used.

This was okay... has the potential to be better with a little bit of tweaking. Besides the flavor of the soy sauce, I thought it was a little bland. This would also be great served with some type of sauce.

This is a great recipe!  My husband devours this and always says we need to have it more often.  I've served it on top of the Mandarin Almond Salad from this site and it was delish!  I've even forgotten to put the butter on top (found the melted butter in the microwave the next morning! oops!), and it was STILL good!  Thanks Loll, for this quick easy and yummy recipe!

I have to say, sadly, that this was terrible. I tried to improvise according to the reviews I read, using sugar, sesame oil, garlic, a bit of water, etc. But the coating was soggy and tasteless and we both ended up eating PB & J. I had high hopes, but have to reluctantly give this one star, only because I can't give it zero stars.

I didn't think too much of this recipe.  The coating did not "coat" very well.  The flavor was bland.  It did come out tender and juicy but I was not crazy about the flavor.  I might make it again...I like the fact that is baked and not fried.

This is a very easy recipe to make....kind of a lower fat version of sesame chicken. And the chicken always comes out tender when I make it.  Just wished it had the sweet and sour quality of the restaurant sesame chicken.

This was a wonderful recipe.  The chicken was SO moist and tasty.  I always use Lite Soy sauce because regular is too salty.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe to the letter and it was fantastic.  The last breast was a little short on flour/sesame seed mixture, so next time I'd make just a little bit more of the mix.

This recipe was very good, but I made some changes after making it the first time exactly as the recipe calls.  The second time making it, I used chicken tenders instead, and decreased the cooking time to 25 minutes.  It came out juicy and moist.  I also used more soy sauce and butter and added garlic for more seasoning.

Wow!  I loved this!  I nearly skipped the toasting of the sesame seeds out of sheer laziness, but very glad I didn't!  This was so flavoursome & the meat stayed really moist.  The only thing I did differently was to add a bit of chilli powder to the sesame/flour mix... Just because I have to, with this chilli addiction I have.  It's still really tasty without!

This was great! I followed the suggestions of doubling the flour mixture and adding 2 tablespoons maple syrup to the soy sauce mixture before i rolled the chicken in it, then coated it. cooked less then 40 minutes, but longer then 30. delicous!

My husband put it best: the chicken was "lightly flavored" Not bad at all.  I served it with fried rice and stir fried veggies.  I also added panko bread crumbs as another user suggested because I too had them on hand.

Pretty good. I took several other reviewers advice and followed their changes. Only other thing i did different was i used 1 1/2 tbsp of reg. soy sauce, a splash of sesame oil and 1 1/2 tbsp of medium sweet soy sauce.

We enjoyed this recipe a lot and I did think it was a bit salty but not crazy salty. I did cover it lightly with foil for the first 20 minutes them pulled it back. I will make this again.

Fair.  Chicken was moist, but a little salty.  I added minced garlic and a little ground ginger to the soy sauce.  It would have been bland if I didn't.  Coating mixture was still soft on most of the chicken after 40 minutes of baking and I didn't even use all the butter.

I stuck to the specified ingredients to see how this dish would be.  I could not believe how JUICY the chicken turned out!  It was fantabulous & I will definitely make this again!  Thanks!

This was very good and a cinch to make! I followed the advice of others and used strictly low sodium soy sauce and did not add salt. It was perfect and the chicken was soooo moist, I was amazed at how moist it was. It was delicious. A keeper with us!!

I had to increase the dry ingredients x4 to accommodate the 4 chicken breasts in the recipe. I cut the chicken breasts in half lengthwise.  The result was a pretty bland.

Great recipe! Pesonally I would have used less sesame seeds, and it needed a little kick to spice up the flavor, but very good taste nevertheless

I really wanted to like this recipe.  I tried it three times (once as written, two with modifications listed by other reviewers, also made a sesame chicken sauce from this site) in hopes of finding a version we enjoyed.  Ease & moisteness were great, flavor was fine.  I might try it one more time before totally deleting it.

I have no idea how this recipe managed to get so many people to vote it so highly - we didn't like it at all.  There wasn't nearly enough flour/seeds to coat all chicken breasts - and when the chicken was done cooking, it had absolutely no flavour (except for sesame).  We will definitely not make this dish again....try something else if you're looking for a dish with flavour.

Okay as is, but awesome with a few additions. For those who thought it was a little plain, I recommend dipping the chicken in teriyaki sauce rather than soy sauce. Just a light store-bought variety works great! I serve this on top of pan-fried rice w/ stir-fried broccoli and pineapple chunks. Quite yummy!

This was great! My husband and I loved this recipe. I followed it to the letter with just a little less butter. I also cut the chicken into strips, so they cooked in half the time. Thanks for such a great and quick recipe.

I didn't read the recipe properly, and added the soy sauce to the sesame seeds, flour, salt and pepper. I threw it away and started again! Unfortunately, I then ran out of sesame seed breading, and didn't have any more sesame seeds to make more! Anyway, I made this with chicken breasts cut into strips. It was very tasty. My only advice would be to grease the baking dish - the chicken stuck a little. Great recipe, Loll!

My husband loved this and wanted even MORE sesame seeds (i had already added many extra!)  I thought that it was alright.  You def need to add more flour to coat.  It got very sticky.  Overall great and husband wants it again!

This came out great! I actually doubled the recipe in everything but the chicken, and I pounded the chicken breast halves to tenderize them and make them flatter. We had it 24 hours after I made it and it was really moist and very tasty. Also, since I keep kosher, I substituted the melted butter for some non-dairy, Pareve buttery spray (Mazola has one, and there is an Albertson's brand one as well). If it is coming out dry for anyone, try baking it covered for the first 15 to 20 minutes.

This was some of the best chicken I've ever tasted, and I'm not big on chicken.  I roasted the sesame seeds for 5 minutes at 400, then poured them out onto a paper plate immediately to cool.  I agree with most that more flour & sesame seeds are needed to dredge the chicken in.  I used sr flour and no salt & it was perfect.  I also added a few good dollops of honey to the soy sauce.  The sesame seeds made the wonderful flavor, it was so yummy.  I'll make this many times.  Thanks for posting this great dish.

Wow this is great!  It's lighter than the restaurant style sesame chicken since it's not fried...in fact I prefer it baked!  It's a second helping recipe for sure!

Very moist and flavorful, I think.  I used three huge chicken breasts and doubled the sesame seeds and tripled the soy sauce.  The butter is a must.  I served with a brown rice/barley/pearled wheat blend from Near East.  Tasty!

I always like to follow recipes exactly the first time to determine whether it works or not. And this recipe worked for me. It tasted great and the chicken stayed moist. My husband even liked it and he's pretty fussy. Definitely would make it again.

I am sad to say this is the worst recipe I have tried so far. The chicken was nice and tender but the flavour was disgusting. It was too salty and tasted flat and boring. It needs more than just soy as the dipping sauce and the salt in the flour dip needs to be eliminated - soy sauce is salty enough! 
Will not be making again.

The first time I made this recipe it was definately missing something...but was still good.  The second time I made it I added about 1T of brown sugar to the top of the chicken after I layed it in the pan.  I also turned on the broiler for about 1-2 minutes before taking it out of the oven and it was more "carmelized" like I thought it would be the first time.  My husband and son loved it but I am still expecting something else I guess.

Delicious! All my 3 children (ages 1-5) loved this chicken, as well as my husband. I cut the chicken in slivers and marinated it in the soy sauce while preparing the flour mixture which I doubled. After baking I served it sliced over Jasmine rice and peas. It's a great easy recipe that rewards your minimal efforts with MAXIMUM flavor!

This was really delicious! We made a couple of modifications to the recipe.....we cut the chicken into strips....used alot more sesame seeds than the recipes suggested and marinated the chicken in the soysauce mixture for about 10 minutes... We really liked this one and will definitely do it again...

This is one of the best recipes I have come across.  It takes only a few simple ingredients and very little prep time.  Add rice and a vegetable and you have a quick dinner and no stress.

The chicken was too salt and not at all flavorful-only soy sauce taste.  I could barely finish the first and last bite of this soy-sauce infested chicken.  I would definately not try this recipe!!

I was very disappointed with the outcome.  The flavor was not oriental enough and it was too salty.  I omitted additional salt from the recipe as soy sauce is salty enough already.  Yet the chicken was still salty.  The sesame seeds were soggy and even though I doubled the flour mixture used to coat the chicken, there was still not enough mixture.  This is one recipe I will definitely not try again.

Too salty - I would definitely not add extra salt next time.  Also, not enough liquid - when I took the chicken out to baste it, there was nothing to baste with & I had to add 1/4 cup of water!  However, this was tasty & I would try it again with modifications.

I forgot to pour the melted butter on top of the chicken, until I checked into the oven after 10 minutes of baking and saw the soy sauce on the bottom of the pan already burned and dry.  DUH!!  I'm sure with the butter that wouldn't have happened!  But it was pretty good anyway, even with the slightly burned taste.  I pounded the chicken breasts to an even thickness (which makes them bigger), and didn't have enough of the sesame/flour coating.  I expected the sesame seeds to be crunchey and was dissappointed when they really weren't (I don't think my kids even realized they were sesame seeds, they just thought it was fine bread crumbs from in the food processor).  Maybe it's because I poured the butter on after they were partially baked?  At any rate, it's worth trying again!

Easy and tasty. Overall found the dish a bit salty (and I used low sodium soy sauce and unsalted butter) so maybe would add a bit of water with the soy sauce next time. Also, tried to baste like the recipe says but did not really have enough pan juices, so adding water may help with that too. My chicken breasts were small and they were cooked through and juicy delicious after only twenty minutes. Thanks for sharing this great weeknight recipe, Laurie!

I really liked this recipe but I did add some water to the pan to give more "sauce." Next time I might add a bit of something sweet too just to give it some depth.

I liked this recipe but would recommend marinating the chicken in the soy mixture for a 1/2 hour before adding the coating.  It was a little lacking in flavor for us but the coating was really good.

This was very yummy! It was sooo easy to make! I only made 2 chicken breasts because I wasn't sure if I would like it, but it was delicious! The chicken was moist on the inside and had a little crunch on the outside from the sesame seeds. The seeds didn't stick very well, so after I put them on the baking sheet, I threw a few more on top! The only thing I added was 1/4 tsp of garlic powder to the dry mix. Thanks for a super simple and yummy dish!

This recipe was just fair. It lacks something. I'm not sure if I will make it again but if I do, I will probably add sugar or drizzle it with honey.

This dish was delicious.  I had panko crumbs on hand so I used those instead of the flour.  I added 1 tsp ground ginger and garlic powder to the mixture.  Per another reviewer, I drizzled honey on chicken as well as butter before cooking.  Also 1/2 hour cooking time was perfect.  I will definitly mmake this again in the future.

made a lot of changes and it was pretty good (although my husband wasn't into it). i sprayed the baking pan with oil. i put the chicken in a ziploc and added soy sauce to it, then mixed to coat. this worked well. per the reviews, i doubled the sesame seed mixture, which may have been too much, and i added a bit of onion powder and garlic powder. i should have omitted the salt (soy sauce has plenty, even though i used low-sodium). i also omitted the butter.

Pretty good! I had two HUGE chicken breasts so I doubled the sauce recipe and also added the juice of a fresh orange. As a few people mentioned it was just a tad bland so I added ginger and garlic powder to the liquid. After it was all cooked, I made a dipping sauce for it with 1/2 cup soy sauce, 1/2 cup rice vinegar, 2 tbls. honey, the juice of two lemons, 1/8 tsp. ginger and some garlic powder. That made a HUGE difference and it was very tasty. Will definitely make again with the dipping sauce.

Based on other reviews, I added extra soy and margarine to the pan and covered it lightly with foil until the last five minutes. Wouldn't change much else with the recipe.

Wasn't thrilled with this.  I would have cut the cooking time back, this came out very dry.  It needs some spices to give it more flavor.  It was very bland.

This is a very tasty, very easy recipe. I bake them on a wire rack in the baking dish so that the bottoms don't get soggy, and then I serve them with a teriyaki dipping sauce. They're fantastic!

Was really excited about this recipe but was a little disappointed. As the other reviews stated it was bland I added some garlic powder, paprika and white pepper for a little zing. The spices where fine but the coating was kind of mushy.

This was really good.  I made some modifications.  I marinated the chicken in teriyaki sauce for about an hour before prepping.  I used the teriyaki marinade rather than soy sauce.  I also added some garlic salt instead of regular salt and paprika to the dry mix and I used whole wheat flour rather than regular.  There wasn't enough dry mix and I was only using 3 chicken breasts, so I suggest doubling the dry ingredient list.  I had pounded my chicken pretty thin, so I only cooked for 30 minutes.   

It was really flavorful and good!  It's a good family friendly recipe because kids will eat it & yet it's nice enough for adults.

I made this for dinner last night and using suggestions from other reviewers, used only half the soy sauce and added about 3 tbls. water. I also added just a pinch of garlic to the dry ingredients. It turned out pretty well, the flavor was good and it was pretty easy to make. I would use this recipe again.

Good - It's different, but not overpowering and adds a great flavor to dinner. I, too, added about a tbs of sesame oil to the melted butter.. Yum!

Made this dish last night at the last minute.  I like that it requires minimal ingredients - and everything I had on hand!  The soy sauce does burn in the bottom of the pan, but I will follow the advice of other reviewers next time.  Overall, though, it was very moist and tasty!

Me and my fiance really liked this dish.  I found that there was not to much marinade to baste the breast with. The breast I used were very thick.  Next time I will use a little thinner breast.

This recipe was good, but not great:(
I would put tinfoil on the bottom of the pan next time & not add additional salt. I also thought it would crisp up better. Overall good, love sesame seeds & the calcium they provide:D

This turned out alright, but not great. I found this to be quite bland. There definitly wasn't enough liquid to baste the chicken with. I added about 3/4 C of chicken broth to the pan in the middle of cooking when I realized it was going to burn to the bottom. Doing this made a nice sauce to serve over the chicken.

Very good.  My husband loved it and wants me to make it again and again.  I wasn't so enthusiastic about it, lol.  I like chicken to have a sauce with it but it is quite good.

I don't know if I did something wrong with this recipe, but it was so salty that I couldn't even eat it. There is nothing in the recipe that sweetens the flavor at all, and there definitely needs to be. I won't make this again.

Chicken breasts were very easy to cook, my family usually thinks the white meat is dry,  but added more soy sauce at the table and LOVED this recipe.

Good with rice and easy to make. The chicken was moist and flavorful, but that is because I more than doubled the amount of soy sauce, flour and pepper. I used a glass dish, and the chicken was a little stuck on the bottom and the extra soy sauce got a little burnt around the edges, but that was my fault for adding so much. MMMmm I love soy sauce! I will deffinetly make this again!

This was a pretty good dish.  It was nothing like sesame chicken that you get in any restaurant around here but I could tell from the recipe that it would not be.  I will be making it again.

This was pretty bland.  My husband did not like it all.  I have to admit, it sounded a lot better than it turned out to taste.  I was looking forward to it too, because I love sesame seeds, but it just didnt help this one out.

Quick and easy to make.  Very moist and juicy.  I cooked 5 chicken thighs for 50 minutes at 375.  I didn't toast the sesame seeds prior, but they toasted quite a bit in the oven.  You could taste the soy sauce which made it much better, but the sesame seeds gave it a slightly unpleasant texture.

This recipe turned out really well, the only thing is that the chicken really stuck to the pan.  I cooked it at 400 degrees for about 35 minutes in a glass 13 x 9 pan and I wasn't sure I was going to be able to get the chicken out.  I don't know if spraying it with Pam first would help or not.  I will be making this recipe again, the family liked it.

This recipe was very good.  I substituted teriyaki sauce for the soy sauce.  I also used boneless skinless chicken thighs which came out very tender.

This is a fantastic recipe and good enough for company.  My only suggestion is to double the flour mixture as it's not enough to dredge four chicken breasts.  I also doubled the soy sauce and butter and we loved it.  A keeper.

This was pretty good overall!!!  We are low carb people so I subtituted the flour for soy flour.  This added nice flavor, plus we sprinkled splenda on the chicken and that helped to give it a REALLY nice taste.

Great flavor, and cooks up really well in the oven. A little salty, so I'll leave out the salt in the flour mixture and use low sodium soy sauce.

This was good-I agree it was a bit salty, even using low sodium soy sauce. It was very rich. I served it with au gratin rice and steamed broccoli. I would make this again.

Another easy to prepare recipe - if my husband can do it, basically anybody can.  Did find that the coating coated 2 breasts ok, but had to push to get something on the remaining 2 (incease/double next time).  Also, just a touch too salty.  Will try again.

This was good enough to have once, but I don't think I'll make this any more than that.

This is quick and easy.  Followed the recipe as it is and it worked out just right.  True..there is not alot of coating left over, but how wasteful do you want to be? And yes it does bake on the pan a bit but no worse than alot of things.  I would make this again for sure.

I cut the chicken into smaller pieces and added some bread crumbs.  My six year old proclaimed these nuggets even better than McDonalds (=the ultimate compliment)!

Flavor was fine, but the chicken was very dry. I kept adding liquid during cooking and the chicken was still dry. I'm not sure that I will try this again.

The chicken tasted really good and the sesame seeds are an interesting variation.  The kids seemed to like it, and my husband commented on how good it was (which is really saying something).  This recipe is very quick and easy to prepare.

Great idea but....  Others were right when they said not enough sauce!!!  I tried to add more soy sauce and that just made it way more salty.  I also had some sesame oil and I added a few drops of it and I think it added more flavor.  Definatley needs more sauce...  IDEAS????

I cut my chicken into small pieces, but I only used 2 chicken breasts for my husband and myself.  It turned out a little dry, but I think it's because I did that.  It had a great taste--I love soy sauce.  Next time, I'm going to add 1 Tbsp. of terryaki sauce to the soy sauce.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a crowd pleaser.  I changed a couple of things: I added toasted sesame oil to the soy sauce, and instead of drizzling butter, I sprayed the coated chicken pieces with olive oil spray.  Since I was making a larger quantity, I put the liquid mixture in a plastic bag, added the chicken, shook to coat, and then drained the bag of the liquid.  Then I added the flour/sesame mixture and shook it around to coat.  Worked out great!

This was a very easy recipe, but as others mentioned it was way to salty for me.  I didn't even add the salt the recipe calls for, just too salty from the soy sauce.  The chicken was very juicy and tender and I only cooked it for 30 min.  Just needs something to offset the salty flavors and it might be better.

really tasty flour and seeds give the chicken a good texture and keep it juicy. Careful not to over do it with the soy sauce I did and it came out a little on the salty side.

This is a dish I used to only eat in restaurants, until today. A really simple, yet tasty meal. My own preference and recommendation is to mix up a homemade garlic sauce to go with it  - I crushed 4-5 pieces of garlic into a bowl with yoghurt and some mayo. Add some spices - salt, pepper, even a tiny bit of mustard for aroma, and voila - you got the perfect dip for your baked chicken.

I used MrsValerie's modifications. While I liked how it turned out, I found the sauce a bit dark for my tastes. I think I need to play with it some more.

Wasn't much flavor, and the soy sauce burned. I followed the recipe exactly except I did what other people did and dipped the chicken in the soy sauce first then dredged it in the sesame seed mixture. Even if it had come out it wouldn't taste very good.

I cannot believe this recipe doesn't have 5 stars, as it is mine and my boyfriend's favorite out of all thre chicken recipes I have made from this site. I tend to double the recipe just to make more, but the proportions are exactly right. Love this chicken! It is light and airy and so easy to make!

Good flavor with a lot of sesame seeds. It definately needs a sauce to go with it.  At least my chicken didn't have any juice come out of it.

I’m always looking for different chicken dishes and came across this gem. I cut my chicken breast into medallions and then brined them to keep them from drying out.  Also, I recommend using a low sodium soy sauce.  The flavor of the sesame seeds imparted good flavor and texture for these cutlets.

So yummy! I did reduce the soy sauce by half and added a little teriyaki both gluten free. I also substituted the flour with rice flour to make it a gluten free dish. I did omit the salt, I found it salty enough without it. I sliced chicken into strips and soaked in egg whites then dredged in mixture. I wanted it to cook a little faster so I sautéed in pan with a little sesame oil. I omitted the butter as well. I added the soy and teriyaki sauce when chicken was almost done. Only took around  5 minutes each side. I prepared this with the peanut butter noodles. My family loved it!

I used Bragg's Aminos instead of soy for a lower sodium content. Very tasty! I need more practice at this one.

Delicious, however you do need about double the flour and sesame seed mixture.

A friend gave me a pound of sesame seeds so I went looking for recipes.  We really enjoyed this.  Quick and easy to make.  I thought it was a little salty but my husband thought it was perfect.

I just tried this tonight. I had to double the coating and next time, I'll put the soy sauce in a bowl and dip the chicken in to that and then the coating mixture.  I also used chicken breast tenders so it only took 30 minutes to bake.  The soy sauce in the bottom of the pan got very dry, but the chicken turned out very tender. My family really liked this recipe and I will make it again

easy to make. agree w/most reviewers... will try a bag instead of wax paper, teriyaki sauce instead of soy, pineapple halves & honey would be a nice touch. didn't have to bake it more than 25 minutes

This was really good after making a few changes!  As others suggested, I added ginger, onion powder, garlic salt & garlic powder.  I also added extra sesame seeds and in general made extra of the flour mixture to make sure I could really coat the chicken.  Another thing I changed (and this was purely a mistake because I grabbed the wrong bottle) was to use low sodium Teriyaki sauce instead of soy sauce!  Then I drizzled honey over the chicken before baking.  So dang good!

I'm always on the lookout for quick, easy chicken recipes to save me from the same old stuff that I eat all the time. Glacing through the reviews, I decided to add the pinch of ginger and a shake or two of garlic powder to the flour mix. This was an excellent recipe--so good that I wanted to eat the extra that I made for my lunch tomorrow. The sesame seeds really are wonderful. The only fault is that it may have been a tad too salty but I'm sure that could be fixed by using a low sodium soy sauce or simply eliminating the salt from the drege mix.

Very tasty! My husband & I loved it! I followed the advice of the other reviewers and added onion powder and ground ginger to the dry ingredients. I also dipped in soy, then the flour mixture, then straight to a baking sheet. Delicious! This would make a great appetizer- put tenderloins on skewers- yum!

This came out pretty good. A bit salty but very moist. I used half low salt soy and the other half regular and I added sesame oil to the soy sauce before dipping the chicken as well as garlic powder. I had to double the recipe all around. I will make again except I will use only low sodium soy and I will not add any salt.  I liked that I had everything on hand too!

Tender. Nice mild flavor.  A little too salty for me. Next time I will use reduced sodium soy sauce.

This was very good!  I was surprised with how tender the chicken turned out.  For some reason I did not have enough liquid to baste, but it did not affect the chicken.  Next time I am going to slice the chicken into strips and have different sauces to dip them into.

Although the chicken stayed very moist, I wasn't that impressed with the flavor. I was expecting a more oriental flavor, but it was a little bland. I even added a little terriaki and more soy sauce. The other thing that bothered me was that the soy burned in the pan about half way through cooking time.

I have like zero cooking skills, and yet it was a success! My husband was very surprised that I cooked something that didn't taste or look funny! Next time I think I will forgo the salt since the soy sauce is pretty salty already.
