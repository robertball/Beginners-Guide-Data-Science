This is pretty good with the blackberry brandy, but it's even better with any one of the puckers. I like to double up on the pucker for a stronger drink. TIP: Float some frozen berries in this drink and pour them in flutes for a more elegant look, like for a baby shower or wedding shower.

This is good, but I like Zima with a shot of Chambord, just about the same thing.  Unfortunately for all of us they have ceased production of Zima as of October 20, 2008.

I used homemade blackberry brandy and this was really good. I'll have to admit that I do prefer the pucker as another reviewer mentioned. Still good though and a nice treat!
