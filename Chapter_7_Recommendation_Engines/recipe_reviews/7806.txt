This was easy to make and came out very moist and crumbly.  I used cinnamon instead of ginger b/c I didn't have any... it worked perfectly. You should try this!

We added fresh cranberries because we had them and we subbed lemon zest as we had no actual oranges in the house. Also added an orange-liqueur and cream cheese frosting, which was delicious!  But the cake is really good on its own and we didn't find it excessively crumbly, maybe because of the added moisture from the cranberries.

The flavor of this cake is very good, but it is crumbly which makes it hard to eat. I used cinnamon instead of ginger b/c another reviewer said they had and cinnamon sounded better to me than ginger.

Pretty good.  Hubs commented it wasn't sweet enough; I thought it was fine, but I'm not a huge sweet fan and he likes things sweeter than I do.  I did add frozen blueberries to this, which could have decreased the sweetness. This doesn't remind me of a regular dessert cake but more of a coffee cake; the oatmeal makes it heartier and I think it would be good for breakfast.  All in all, very easy and I baked it in a Bundt pan since hubs had stolen my 9x13 to defrost chicken in the fridge.  I just baked for an hour and it worked perfectly well.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was great!  After reading what others had written, I added an extra egg to make it a little more moist. That seemed to do the trick.  It wasn't crumbly and didn't fall apart as I picked up a piece. I was a little iffy about adding the ginger because I don't normally like ginger, but decided to add it anyway.  I'm glad I did.  I loved the taste!  I also didn't add the walnuts.  It still didn't really rise very much.  The texture reminded me of fudge brownies.   I actually liked the texture like that.  I will definitely be making this again.

The batter was very think and hard to spread.  The cake came out very dry and crumbly.  It fell apart as I took it out of the pan.  It didn't rise at all.  The flavor was good, but the texture was horrible.  I wouldn't make this again.

Very tastey but the texture was very crumbly.  It fell apart as you tried to lift a piece from the pan.  Very messy.  I added 1/2 c. dried cranberries.  Very good flavor, just didn't care for the way it crumbled apart.

The flavor was good but the texture was too crumbly. I added 1/2 cup of milk at the end as it was so thick I could barely get out of the bowl into the baking sheet. Even with that modification the cake turned out too doughy and crumbly. I’m not sure how to modify so won’t be making this again.
