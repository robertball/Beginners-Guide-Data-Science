This recipe is awesome. Easy to follow and the brownie-like fudge cupcakes taste great. Only four stars though cause they don't look too exceptional and I had to tweak the recipe based on other member's comments. I used unsweetened chocolate to make sure it wasn't too sweet. Based on other comments about caving in, I made sure not to over-beat/mix the batter and added a tsp of baking soda. I will definitely use this recipe in the future.

I am giving these cupcakes only 3 stars because the tops of the cupcakes fell in 1/2 way through baking them and then a puffy ring of sugary dryness broke off from the rest of the cupcake, leaving the bottom portion fudgey (mmmmm!) but the top part crunchy (also mmmmmm)... though together the two mmmmms just didn't do it for me.  I scaled the recipe to two- one for me and my man on our anniversary; and I wanted something pretty to put on the table... but in order to save these, I had to put a scoop of ice cream in the big ugly holes of them and garnish with strawberries.  All in all, they tasted OK, but I would have preferred true fudginess or true fluffiness.

Maybe I'm picky, but these cupcakes had a chocolate-sugar crust that was completely separate from the body of the cupcake.  When I touched them, the crust broke and sank into the cupcake.  The taste is good, but the presentation has something to be desired.

This recipe was so simple and amazing! I changed the serving size to 36 and made 24 cupcakes with it. They had a nice fudge-y consistency and were a big hit with friends and family. Also, I baked them on multi-convection at 350 degrees and they came out better than when I tried them at 325.

Rather than a cup "cake", this really is more like a cup "brownie". They are delicious, fudgy and rich, but don't expect a traditional cupcake. I used silicone baking cups instead of paper and sprayed them with PAM prior to filling them with the batter. Once cooled, I removed the "brownies" from the silicone cups and topped them with a creamy white frosting, and they were perfect.

I just don't get it!  These cupcakes don't rise, in fact they collapse.  It was kind of a dissapointment, as I made these for my husband's work meeting.  The taste is good- like a cake like brownie.  I just can't recommend them because they are unattractive and small.  I made 15 cupcakes with this recipe- not 24, and they were STILL small, with large concave tops!  I would have rather made brownies.

These certainly are chocolatey. So much so, that I'd say they're more brownie than cupcake. I decreased the sugar by 1/2 cup and they were still very sweet. The tops of mine did fall in before I even took them out of the oven, but they tasted good so I won't complain too much. They don't need any frosting...they're too much like brownies so they can stand on their own.

I make these when I want to wow the chocolate lovers at work.  When you top them with fudge frosting the go like hotcakes. Don't overbake as stated. I also roast the pecans before I put them in the batter.  That is a good way to get added flavor in any recipe using nuts.

For a beginner cook, this recipe was easy and very satisfying.I made it with my 6-year old daughter and the cupcakes came out just the way we like it-fudgy inside, and crunchy on the outside!

Flavorless and sunk in the middle. Worst cupcake I ever made. I don't consider these chocolate fudge. They are barley chocolate flavored. Texture is more of a brownie than a cupcake. Very disappointed.

These worked out very well for me.  I made these for my friend's 30th birthday party (served to tipsy people in a bar!), and they were a big hit.  I used peanut butter frosting to complete them.  

I reduced the sugar by 1/2 a cup and added 1 tsp of baking power as per previous reviews.  I also left out the pecans as I didn't have any, plus I don't really enjoy nuts and chocolate together.  The recipe made 16 big cup cakes that were gooey in the inside.  I'll definitely make these again.

These cupcakes are great. Mine did rise, and never collapsed. I made somewhat larger cupcakes (so it only made 12) and still only had to cook them a little over 30mins. I used double-layer paper cupcake cups inside a muffin tray. These have a lovely fudge-y inside and a crunchy top like a brownie. Not your conventional cupcake but really yummy. I think these can be eaten with or without frosting, and it's a brilliant recipe for such simple ingredients.

Loved the cupcakes. I didn't have trouble with collapsing...that is usually due to opening the oven too soon because the cold air makes the cupcakes collapse.  If you dont want small cucakes fill it 3/4 full or a little more.  Make sure you grease the top of the muffin tins in case they rise too much that way it doesn't stick. What is really important is to make sure you cream together the sugar and butter very well. If you dont you wont have a rising agent.  Made these with the Wedding Cake frosting on this sight only I made fresh raspberry syrup in the cupcakes and the frosting.  Delish but not the right frosting.  Needs something lighter or something really chocolaty...would go with some of the other suggestions next time.

Very chocolately, my favorite kind!  At first I wondered, when the dough was almost as thick and stiff as peanut butter, but I just spooned it in the tin anyway.    I did use unsweetened chocolate squares instead of semi-sweet since that's all I had.  They came out perfect and didn't collapse or any other bad thing.  I did follow very carefully all the "mix on low", "sift the flour" instructions since I was worried after reading some other reviews.  It made 12 delicious, oversized muffins for me.  Heating the chocolate and butter is a lot easier in the microwave.

no flavor.  I liked the idea of the few indgredients, but this just didn't cut it.  The weird thing is mine looked just like the picture, so I know I didn't do anything wrong.

The flavour was OK, not fantastic, and I didn't like the texture at all.  It might be my own personal taste but I won't be making these again.

Wow, these were phenomenal! I don't like fluffy cake or cupcakes, so I was happy to read that these are more like a brownie. They were soooo fudgy. I put peanut butter cups in the middle of some and frozen cookie dough ball in some. These will be made often in my house!

These would be more aptly named "Brownie Cups."  They aren't really cupcakes.  That said, they are tasty single serving brownies with a crisp top and semi-fudgy inside. I halved ther recipe, added 1/2tsp. instant coffee, dissolved in a little hot water, and about 1/2C of toffee bits.  I just barely had enough batter to 1/2 fill each cup.

These cupcakes are like brownies in a muffin cup.  The texture is moist and brownie-like.  I used unsweetened chocolate instead of semi-sweet and love the extra chocolately flavor.  I had no problems with the tops caving in or separating.  They came out perfectly!

I made these with the little girl that I babysit for her birthday party. You should have seen the look of disappointment on both of our faces when we pulled out sloppy, concave lumps of brown. They tasted good, but if you are looking for a "pretty" cupcake, these are NOT for you!

This was my most favorite recipe like EVVEERRRRRRR. The cake was soft and squishy and rose quite well.  The flavor of the chocolate was a perfect balance between a milk chocolate and a warm fudge. The only complication that I came about was a mild misdemeanor with the oven.  But that was completely my fault, as you can see by the burns on my face. The situation was handled and the doctors were paid properly. I will definitely try this recipe again, with a different oven. Thank you for your time.
Yours truly,
Morgan Brunetti

Like everyone else said, these sink in the middle.  But they're also right about the brownie-ness of these.  A perfect brownie cupcake hybrid with a fudgy inside and crisp top.  And the paper didn't stick to the sides, which has happened to me before. I piped whipped ganache on top and they were very good.  Just the kind of thing to get you through a Wednesday.

At first all the caved-in tops put me off, but I decided to judge for myself. I don't know people are talking about! They were delicious, no caved in tops! I made one batch yesterday, and due to there magical over-night disappearance, another batch today. I used Smart Balance instead of butter, but other then that, I followed the recipe exactly. I highly recommend!

i found this recipe easy to make even though i did take out the nuts due to allergies in our house hold. i didnt find my muffins collapsed at all mind you i did cook them for about an extra 8 mins due to my dodgy oven but didnt find they were tough at all due to the extra time. these muffins were gone by the next morning will definitely be making these again.

These are...interesting. I have to be honest, the recipe and reviews scared me a little so I made some major modifications. Probably enough that I could post it as a separate recipe and shouldn't even be rating this one.

I halved the recipe (since it was a "trial run") and added 1/2 tsp of baking powder and 1/4 cup of milk, oh and a 1/2 teaspoon of cocoa powder. I also split the sugar 1/2 white, 1/2 brown because Japanese people don't like things nearly as sweet as Americans do. I used 60% chocolate squares, and not so many nuts.

They came out pretty good. Not very chocolately; next time I might try 72% chocolate or a little more cocoa powder. They are sweet, though, and I like the consistency a lot. They have a flakey crispy top and they're gooey in the middle (as advertised!). The only thing is, they have bubbles in them! I'm just going with it; I'll call them Crater Cupcakes and tell everyone they're supposed to be that way, or just frost them. So yummy, though.

Turned out great, nice and moist! I was  afraid of them not raising so I added 1 half teaspoon of baking powder. The second time I made them I beat the mixture too much and they came out really light, not what I expected, but after I put them in the fridge overnight they turned out really moist and heavy! I wonder why? Any way love the recipie!

I made this recipe for my mother for her birthday. I halved it (because it was so large!) and baked it in a brownie tin (to form a cake, more than a cupcake). It turned out perfect! It's rich and yummy. I dressed it with a chocolate buttercream icing. Perfect!

Yumm!  The top does have a thin crunch to it and the inside was nice and moist, a good ratio though.  I didn't find the top fell in at all.  I didn't sift the flour and sugar, and therefor didn't get a full 24 servings and they didn't raise much, but otherwise delicious!

Gorgeous brownie-like texture. I made mine half the size, as I didn't have any cake cases, and it still worked brilliantly. The top is like ready added frosting.. A favourite with all.

First of all, the measurements of the ingredients could be clearer (eg. It looks like the chocolate in this recipe is one ounce in TOTAL not that each square is one ounce)
When we put them in the oven for 25 minutes (like it specified in the recipe), they were obviously not done. In fact, the cakes didn't rise at all, they shrunk. 
I was very confused when I didn't see baking powder in the ingredients, which I've learned is almost always necessary in cakes. I realized after reading the reviews, that other people had the same problem. 
I have a gathering tomorrow and I'm glad I decided to make these the night before so now I have time to make something else. 
I've learned a lesson from all this at least, always read reviews and comments before making something.

Followed the instructions exactly, even though I wasn't too sure about how baked they looked at 25 mins. However, given a chance to cool a little they got all deliciously chewy and crispy on top and the inside stayed moist and cakey. So delicious! They aren't much to look at without any fancy topping but they are yummy.

They are very moist & fairly oily due to the butter and eggs. They fall apart easily so I don't know if they could hold frosting. They would work well with ice cream.
The taste is ok, not very rich.

Yes, I made this recipe for a a Chocolat Boutique at our A2 Club.  After reading reviews, I added the 1/2 tsp. of baking powder suggested. I also used 1 cup white sugar and 3/4 cup dark brown sugar. When they came out of the oven, they were puffed up nicely with a smooth thin crust, easily breakable, top, but as they cooled they sunk to the top of the paper cupcake liner.  I was quite disappointed in their appearance, so I gently spread some cream cheese frosting on top. I had to be careful that that thin topping did not break and mix in with the frosting.  Then I put a Dove chocolate candy on top.  Packaged them attractively in flowered clear bags tied with a ribbon, and took them to be sold.  Later at the event different friends were eating them and raving about how absolutely delicious they were.  The word spread and soon they had all sold for $2.00 each.  I am now ready to eat the one I saved at home with a cup of coffee.  After all the raves, I will definitely make them again!

They were all cracked on top and brownie like in the middle. They taste ok, but I cannot serve them to guests. I don't know what kind of cupcake liners you use, but there was not enough batter to fill all of them so I ended up having to make more. That was a time waster, especially since I can't use them now. So disappointed.

I think it needs some baking powder in them. They fell instead of rising.
