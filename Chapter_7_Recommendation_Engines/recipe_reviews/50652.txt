Awesome.  I had to alter a bit - I used 2 small tsps. of Asian chili paste rather than the actual pepper; doubled the soy sauce; dried rather than fresh basil; used the whole can (14 ounce)of light coconut milk; and lastly ground some salt in. Didn't have any cream and it wasn't missed. Rave reviews from Dad and 2 kids.  Yummy.

Good base recipe; I added more garlic, ginger, soy sauce, a bit of salt, Sriracha chili sauce, and green curry paste only because I know my family's taste.  Cream not needed. I also served it over rice rather than the noodles - again, just a family preference.  My kids request this dish regularly!

This was pretty good and quite easy.  I used 2 green hot peppers and one red (they were small)from a jar and left the seeds in.  I also added, garlic, green pepper, curry powder and doubled the soy.  I threw in some frozen peas and a chopped fresh tomato as well.  After a taste test, I liberally salted and peppered and added more curry.  It was a tad bland before tweaking, and I still felt it needed something.  Next time I will add a bit of peanut butter.  It was sufficiently spicy and the noodles sopped up the sauce nicely.  I used lite coconut milk and found the consistency to be perfect.  ALMOST restaurant quality in my estimation.

I used spaghetti instead of rice noodles, since that's what I had.  I used light coconut milk, a jalapeno, and leftover roast chicken.  I added some shredded carrots, and served with sliced mango.  It was a little bland at first, but a squeeze of siracha solved that

Excellent recipe.  This was my first time making Thai food, however this easy to follow recipe made it easy.  After it was finished, I realized it would have been better to add 1/4 more liquids than was called for as it came out a bit dry, but that may have been because of my eye-balling the noodles ;)

Bland.  That was all my family had to say about it.  It had a good creamy base that can be altered to each individuals taste.  We will be using curry pastes next time.

This was really yummy. I am a true Minnesotan and cannot tolerate any spice, so we kind of split the recipe and made half of it with no spicy stuff for me, and I think without that it could have used a little more seasoning. My boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed his half, however, with full complement of spices!

I enjoyed this recipe, except I had trouble with the rice noodles.  They got very sticky and were tasteless.   The second time around, I served it over jasmine rice instead and it turned out much better.

I defintely would add the more soy, real ginger, garlic and curry.  Perhaps add some peanut butter.  The recipe was good, but not spicy enough for our family. :)

No flavor at all, needs something to go with the coconut milk. Maybe more peppers and some garlic.

This was okay.  I served this over rice.  I added some curry powder, and I did not have any cilantro.  Thanks for sharing:)

Here are my notes for the next time I make this delicious dish. I tried to follow it exactly the first time. I did use Thai basil instead of regular & happened to have Thai chili"s so I used it. Also, there was so little soy sauce I doubled it & I used about a heaping tablespoon ginger because I love it. This recipe is very similar to a dish at a very popular restaurant I worked at in San Francisco. So happy for this post. 

Now here come the notes: Used soba noodles, good:) Try Jade (spinach) noodles next time. Next time double the sauce! The following directions are for current recipe (not doubled): Use a heaping tablespoon ginger & 1 Thai chili (could add another for a touch more spice). Only needs 1 chicken breast (try diced). Double the soy sauce. Use Thai basil (cut some more for plate). Add whole can coconut (reserve some to mix with the tbls. cornstarch). Heavy cream is necessary.

I skipped the cilantro, ginger, coconut milk and the rice noodles and it still turned out great!! I don't like relying on cornstarch too much so I ended up using some flour in addition to less cornstarch.  Tastes great and I put it over rice instead of rice noodles and it still works out great! Thank you for the idea for something new for my chicken!

I had to adjust a few things. I used chili powder because I lacked the chili pepper. I also used dried basil. I didn't wait for the sauce mixture to thicken too much and I used the rest of the sauce to pour over asparagus.

This missed the mark for me on Thai flavor - yes, I know this is "Thai-style".  It missed the brightness I so much love in Thai cooking.  However, with adds as others have mentioned this is a good dish.  BTW - parents just ate it as is and thought it was great.
