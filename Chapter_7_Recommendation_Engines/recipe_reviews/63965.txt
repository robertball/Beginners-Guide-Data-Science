This punch was quite good for our family Thanksgiving dinner. The sherbet gets very frothy and looks festive. I found it a little bit on the "too sweet" side so I added water and more pineapple fruit juice. My 6 year old nephew LOVED it so much he had 3 glasses before he even touched his plate!

Tastes like melted orange sherbert, even without the sherbert added!  Everyone at our Sunday school life group loved it!

Perfect! I love the combination of orange and pineapple. I will definitely make this again.
