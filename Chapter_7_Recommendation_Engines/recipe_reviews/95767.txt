Who ever knew that something this simple could be so delicious?  I realized at the last minute that I was out of red wine vinegar...I substituted regular white vinegar with a dash of pinot noir (no problem).  I also decided to spruce it up a little bit at the end by adding a few fresh bacon bits.  Will definitely try this salad again...maybe with warm bacon vinaigrette the next time?

Made this last night for dinner.  I tried the dressing before adding it to the pan and found it bitter (could be because I eye-balled the lemon juice) so I just added a dash of sugar.  First time I've eaten endive and I will make it again! UPDATE: I had to change my four stars to five stars because my mom and I were craving this recipe so I made it again and this time measured everything exact and didn't add the sugar and everyone at home loved this recipe! Thank you for a delicious healthy recipe.

I was given some endive, and I had no idea what to do with it. First I just chopped some up in a salad, but I didn't like it that much. This warm version was much better! The dressing is also very tasty, but the dish is a bit rich overall, so it's good to eat in small portions.

My issue with this is not so much the pine nut and endive pairing - it's a nice idea to complement the bitterness and austerity of endive with the full richness of pine nuts.  The issue is the dressing, which is too sour and only highlights the bitterness in the endive.  Dressing needs to be sweetened with maybe honey or maple syrup.  Or alternatively, make the dressing a little creamier with a touch of yogurt.  The dressing just needs to be rounded out somehow.

This recipe is so simple, yet delicious!
I added sauteed cooking pears and used a mixture of wholegrain and english mustard. It was mind blowingly delicious! Thanks so much

What am I missing?  The endive was bitter.  Should I be using a particular kind of endive?  Think I will try again with a great dressing I use of equal parts honey, lemon juice and olive oil. This dressing is magic over pork tenderloin, vegetables and all kinds of things. Maybe it will reduce the endive bitterness. Also rings didn't work.  Everything fell apart.

I grew up eating belgian endive.  The dijon made it more bitter/tart  and the nuts as well. I will not make this again.

Yum! I have never made anything with endives before but they looked so cute in the store. :) Reading the reviews where people added honey I thought I'd like to sweeten the dressing up too, but had no honey. So I added brown sugar to taste and LOVED this change. The leaves are so pretty I didn't want to cut up into rings, so I peeled off leaves until wouldn't peel, then would slice a couple rings, then peel again, all the way to top. I liked the presentation... some rings, some leaves, it was interesting. I sort of stir fried it in the sauce, and when it lost the super crunchy texture it also lost the bitterness. Still a firm, nice texture and very tasty, will make again to impress guests!

We loved this! Such a great combination of flavors and not bitter at all. The texture was just wonderful (that's what I love about endive). I didn't toast the pine nuts, because I prefer the flavor of them raw; I just tossed them in at the end. I'll definitely be making this again.

I cannot cook a new recipe and talk on the phone at the same time because I ALWAYS screw up. I suppose this qualifies me as a non-multi-tasker. This dish called for pine nuts which I planned on subbing (allergy reasons) with sunflower seeds. However, I also made an orzo side tonight and while cooking, my phone rang and dopey me, put the sunflower seeds into that dish instead. Realizing my mistake, I quickly cooked up some bacon in the microwave and sprinkled it over the salad. Believe it or not, I really do have a point to my review which is, how much we all loved this simple, yet wonderful recipe. This was my first attempt using endive (always heard it was bitter-not so cooked like this) and I'm thrilled I did because my family absolutely loved it in spite of the deletion/addition factors. The bacon added a nice touch, so next time, I'll be using both ingredients. Thanks so much "A c r h"!!!!

I made this as a side dish to some pork tenderloin the other night and the end result was just ok. We found the dressing to be tangier than we would normally enjoy, but the endive and pine nuts were a really nice combination. I will follow the advice of another reviewer and perhaps use a warm bacon vinaigrette next time.

This was a FABULOUS salad! I have been looking for ways to cook endive, and this salad is prefect. My son has a severe nut allergy, so I substituted sunflower seeds for the pine nuts, and it was amazing! I would serve this salad for company. Oh - I also added a tsp of maple syrup just to add an extra depth of flavor,and I'd definitely do it that way again :)

Fantastic!!! I did not change a thing! I made this as a side dish for a pork tenderloin. The guests, 1 being finicky and the other being a very talented cook raved about it. It was one of those dishes that will have no left overs and you will wish there had been! :) Thank you for sharing!!!

If the cost of pinenuts and endives were a little lower, we would have this salad at least once a week. Love Love LOVE this salad. So quick and easy and yet its complex enough to have when hosting.

the sauce was good, but like others, the endive was too bitter for us. It was cooked long enough to soften it, but still was very strong taste. Don't know if I will try endive again.

very good & very simple.

i had a friend from france over for part of the holiday break & honored him with a french inspired theme to our menu.  he truly enjoyed it and thank me for this dish.  he grew up eating endive & had not had it for awhile.  although he had never had it any way but raw.  after thinking about this, i thought it would be nice to make this same recipe again in the future without cooking the endive, which gets soggy & runny very quickly anyhow.

Yummy! I made this for a dinner party last night for the first time and was a little worried because of the reputation of the endive to have such a bitter taste. However, it was a hit! You do have to like the cabbage-type flavor though.

I liked this recipe a lot. I tasted the endive before cooking and it was slightly bitter and sweet. After preparing the recipe, I felt that wilting the endives reduced a lot of the bitterness and combined with the pine nut was a sweet nutty flavor. Even with the Dijon I wanted a more complex flavor so I added a few Parmesan shavings and that did the trick. Maybe try a few bacon crumbles next time.

First time preparing endive, though I've always enjoyed them dining out.  I found this recipe to be a good base in need of a few more garnishings to suit my tastes.  As is, the recipe is basic and versatile enough to work with any number of types of cheeses, nuts and fruit...I completely separated the leaves, washed and stacked them, then sliced that way...Carmelized some chopped red onions, sauteed the pinenuts, added the endive.  In my dinner bowl I placed a scoop of freshly made brown rice, served the endive salad on top of that and added cut segments of blood orange, a very light sprinkling of gorgonzola cheese, and drizzled the dressing on top.  It was absolutely wonderful!...For my one serving of dressing, I still used the same amount of mustard and vinegar (balsamic) and squeezed in a whole half of lemon.  Drizzle of olive oil, salt and pepper to taste.  Also, I didn't find the endive to be bitter at all, even ate some raw before cooking.

I cut 1/2" rings and used whole almonds instead of pine nuts because I didn't have pine nuts on hand. Also used a combination of red and green endives. It was unexpectedly delicious! I thought the whole almonds would overwhelm the endives, but because I made thick slices, they worked beautifully together.

Sorry, did not like this at all. It was mostly tasteless with bitter bits and the flavour of mustard was not complementary at all. I will definitely not be doing this again.

This salad was different and my family enjoyed it.  I had a hard time finding belgian endive.  Very different flavors, but tasted really good!

This was definitely different, which I usually like, but I would not make these again.  My fiancee didn´t finish the leftovers, he never leaves leftovers in the fridge for more than a day.

I did not care for this one at all.  An expensive mistake considering the price of endive.
