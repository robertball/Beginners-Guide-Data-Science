This is a great recipe, but I took it as a basic one, for me to fiddle with as I like.  Dried parsley for me is akin to hay in flavour, so for me, fresh herbs from the garden (mixed in with the tomatoes) are a must.  I have also made this not just with crushed crackers, but also diced French bread, and stuffing mix, and different cheeses.  I have stopped draining the tomatoes, too, and just add a little more saltines or whatever.  It is a great side dish to ANYTHING, and we love to make a meal of this with just some poached eggs and toast.  My youngest calls it "lasagna", and leftovers are good on toast for breakfast the next day.

This was a good side dish.  I did use stuffing mix instead of the crackers.  Thanks!

I thought this receipe was great.  My daughter made it again the other night and added an egg to the mixture before adding in the diced tomatoes. My mother in law said it reminded her of a dish her mom used to make.  Will definitely make again!

Since I didn't have the 28 oz can of tomatoes on hand I used 2-14.5 oz. cans. In the future I wouldn't drain them since I found the finished dish a little dry. Also I would add just a little sugar to cut the acid taste of the tomatoes.

Good base recipe.  I give 5 stars after I made a few changes.  I sauted some onions and garlic and added some spinach and shredded chedder to the mix.  Was also thinking that next time I might add some Feta instead of the parm.  You can do anything you like... clean out the fridge!

This is my ultimate comfort food. So easy to throw together and so satisfying as a side or a main. I love tomatoes with cheese so if I have it lying around I'll stir through some grated mozzarella before baking.

Not much taste - might as well have heated a can of tomatoes.  I might experiment with red pepper flakes, garlic, or something to spice it up..It certainly is easy enough.

I did not like this at all, maybe because I don't really care for canned tomatoes I guess.  My husband liked it though.

This is an excellent tomato side dish.  We aren't vegetarians, but anyone can enjoy this!  It's great served with the Baked Salmon Filets Dijon in the Seafood section of Allrecipes.  The flavors melded very well.  Serve with rice pilaf and you have a fantastic meal everyone will enjoy!  C. Ferris

I expected the crackers to be a little less soggy and the top to be a little more crispy. This recipe would be great if only it was crunchier. Never made anything like this.......glad I tried it even though we didn't really like it.

This was similar to my mom's scalloped tomatoes.  She didn't drain the tomatoes and used stewed tomatoes.  She layered crushed saltine crackers, layer of tomatoes, crackers, tomatoes, ending with crackers.  Then add milk just till you see it around edges, then baked for about 40-45 min.  We used a deep dish because it would puff up.  We had this every Thanksgiving.  Thanks for the memory, I miss my Mom a lot.  PS  used the same amount as you did.

Nursery comfort food at its very best.  I never use dried parsley bercause it has no taste.  (Dried basil is another herb that doesn't dry successfully).  I used fresh parsley but it can be omitted and dish won't suffer.  Sometimes I use crackers and sometimes, cubed crusty bread, day-old.  Butter should be left out for kid-friendly and heart-friendly recipe though a daub is fine.  I love this food in the winter served hot and cold in the summer.

This was a pretty good dish. I don't think I'd ever heard of anything like this, and I was skeptical, when looking at the list of ingredients, that it could amount to anything interesting. But it did. I made it exactly as written, but instead of eating it as a side dish, I just had it for two consecutive lunches. I should note that the second half was just fine when reheated the next day. It was quick and easy; I may just make this for a potluck next week. Thanks for a pleasant surprise.

I was searching for a recipe and this was similar to what my Mom used to make.  The only addition was  a little sugar, celery and onion, garlic, crackers and bread were also added.  It is delish.

I had a quart of home canned tomatoes that did not seal so I needed a recipe to use them.  I remember my mother making scalloped tomatoes so decided to give this a try.  I added a shake of dried basil and about 1/4 cup of feta cheese.  DH gave it a thumbs up!  Thanks!

I made this recipe with some variations. I don't like saltines so I used crushed herb seasoned croutons and added 2 cloves of minced garlic to the tomatoes. I also stirred about 1/4 c of mozzarella cheese into the mixture and salt and fresh ground pepper then topped with the parmesan. After reading other reviews I added a little of the tomato juice to moisten but wish I hadn't, it was really mushy but the flavor was great. Tried the leftovers on toast per another reviewer...that was excellent. Will definatley make this again but don't think I would try the recipe as is...it sounds too bland.

I didn't care for this recipe.  If you imagine all the ingredients mixed up, that's what it tastes like.  The flavors don't come together.

I'm not a vegetarian by any means, but every once in a while I like a change. So, i tried this recipe, and am VERY glad that I did! It was very simple, quick, and delicious! I baked it in a round cake pan, and cut it in wedges to serve. Thank you for the great recipe!
