This was an outstanding Turkey Burger. The Cranberry Horseradish Dressing was to die for! I made it exactly as the recipe called for using fresh thyme and parsley.  We will definitely make this one again and again! I made a side dish of Broccoli Slaw using cranberries in the place of raisins and adding some sliced almonds. The dressing was the usual mayo, splenda and vinegar. This was an excellent side for the burgers!

This was a good recipe.  I added cheese and cooked it stove top instead of on a grill and it came out very moist.

I have not tried this recipe but use one very similar.  No egg, but in it's place I add chopped apple.  I like the idea of adding horseradish to the cranberry mayo I use for my dressing.  Will defintely add some of the ingredients listed in this recipe that I don't use in mine for turkey burgers.  There is a sandwich shop close to where I work and I sent them my recipe and occasionally they choose my burger as a special.  And I feel very special when they do.

I was lazy and I made it into a meatloaf with the cranberry sauce on top.  It was super delicious, with no modifications!!

Awesome...the cranberry sauce makes it.  I'll have to work on my "mincing" but otherwise I got rave reviews.  Thank you for sharing.

Wonderful! My husband and kids were skeptical when I had them taste the cranberry sauce mix. But when I put it all together they LOVED it. Didn't have cumin and added a slice of reduced fat provolone.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was fantastic!  I don't buy poultry seasoning, so I looked up a recipe on here to find out how to make some myself, then used the other suggested seasonings except that I subbed celery salt for regular salt.  Also, with the sauce I halved the horseradish for my kids' sake but will try as directed next time.  I had to cook indoors due to horrible thunderstorm and they still tasted fantastic!

Made this as a meatloaf instead of burgers.  First time I tried the sauce but didn't like it - not a big cranberry OR horseradish person.  Second time tried it with raspberry preserves on top, yummy

The burgers were great but we weren't thrilled with the sauce. I recently started substituting carrots in place of celery because it offers more nutrition. Grating them worked well for this recipe.

These were absolutely delicious!! My husband almost never comments on burgers, especially turkey burgers, but he said that they were REALLY good! I also put some farmers cheese on top of the burgers and some vinegar-based coleslaw on top for crunch. Really great!

I have made these twice now and the hubby and i love them.  Very tasty.  My 13 and 16 yo arent crazy about them but my 21 yo likes them.  He keeps wanting to add cheese... I would cut a little back on the lemon juice and a tad on the horseradish only because i prefer the cranberry to come through the most...

The burger portion of this recipe is spot on - you'd swear you were eating stuffing!  I cut the breadcrumbs by 1/3 cup (all I had) and used 1.3 lbs of ground turkey but kept the spices the full amount, so I only made 5 burgers.  Make these burgers ahead if possible and refrigerate.  They grilled up beautifully.  The cranberry sauce was ok - I used a super hot horseradish and it was too much; use a more mild horseradish (or use the creamy variety).  Will definitely have again.  One of the best turkey burger recipes out there.

I made this recipe as submitted. Only changes - I made six burgers and served them with sliced provolone cheese. Really excellent. My husband commented, which is why it earned 5 stars!

These are wonderful turkey burgers.  They hold together and taste great; definitely our go to recipe for turkey burgers now.  The dressing on the burgers was just okay, but made a really good cooking sauce for some pork baked in the oven.

I liked it a lot (but my husband wasn't digging the cranberry horseradish).

used this recipe just for the sauce.. and it was wow.. i was really worried about how much horseradish was in it and it felt a bit much when i first started stirring it around.. but it was perfect.. used it on turkey burgers that were made from turkey sausage.. very good.. ty for the recipe =) ~~ UPDATE: this time i made both the sauce and the burgers.. my only complaint is that the burgers were too "bready" .. next time i'll omit the bread crumbs all together.. used carrot instead of celery.. enjoyed the taste overall.. just not the consistency
