I have to admit, I was leary about making this, since I don't like coffee. But wow, it is reallllly good.  I took another reviewer's suggestion and used butter in place of the oil.  It just sounded better.  Hubby complimented me on this meal more than normal.

Coffee and ham together are delish!  I use a pat of butter instead of oil, and don't add any more salt if the ham is really salty.  I serve this with grits and biscuits and scrambled eggs.

Note to those who want thick gravy...Find another recipe..This is exactly what redeye gravy is supposed to taste like..DO NOT add flour to thicken..this gravy is best served over grits or biscuits.

redeye gravy is a true southern tradition..there is even a little jingle.."grits and gravy and black eyed peas..doo da doo da...lol...we either had a ham steak with it or fried catfish but there were ALWAYS grits made with it instead of potatoes or rice. Oh..and the grits should be buttered, salted, and peppered...not sugared like cream of wheat.

My hubby took one bite and said, "Umm, this is good". The girls took a bite and said, "WOW, this is really good; give it four stars mom"! I took the advice from Cynthia and served it with scrambled eggs and grits. Thanks Norma, for finally a different way I can prepare my ham steaks!

I had never even heard of redeye gravy so when I saw this, I was intrigued. I feel as if I must have done something wrong because I didn't like the end result of this. I come from Seattle where we love all things coffee related and yet, this wasn't what I imagined it would be or COULD be. Maybe I just need to go try it from someone who knows what they are doing with it >.

I had never had redeye gravy and had only heard of it, so I didn't really know what the end product was supposed to be like.  I poured most of the oil off before adding the coffee for the gravy--it seemed like just too much oil.  I served the gravy on mashed potatoes.  The gravy had an interesting and different taste, but I don't think I will make it again.  Maybe it's one of those things you have to be raised on.

This is a great recipe.  I never knew exactly how to make this because noone in my family ever used a recipe and now they rarely cook country ham.  I did not add any salt due to the country ham I had being particularly salty.

This authentic recipe is easy on the budget and the taste buds. I made the recipe exactly as directed except I substituted a non-stick pan for the cast iron pan because I no longer have one. It still came out delicious, not too salty melt-in-your-mouth ham steak & fixin's. Fixed it with biscuits and sweet potatoes with some sweet tea. This is my idea of Southern comfort food. Thank you for the recipe.

I love redeye gravy. I use bacon drippings in place of oil. I never could get vegetable oil to taste right in redeye or tomato gravy. Come to think of it vegetable oil is a curse in any gravy.
For those of you complaining about no taste, the ham you are using is most likely the culprit. In Louisiana we use the giant ham steaks with a bone on the center or the big smoked hams sliced to order. 
If you want a "thicker" gravy try tomato gravy. Redeye is a very brothy gravy. I sometimes add peppers and onions to mine for an extra kick.

Wanted to try it because I'm from the North. Didn't think we'd like it, but dinner has been over for an hour and my husband is still raving about it. It's the perfect foil for ham. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I cheated and added a wee bit of flour because I wanted the gravy to be a bit thick. I served it with kale sauteed with garlic and popovers and it was fantastic! This dish must be an aphrodisiac, my boyfriend jumped me at the table the moment we were done eating!

My mom cooked the salt cured ham over high heat.  Removed the ham and just added water.  Removing all the ham bits and salt from the pan made the "red" color.  Great on Biscuits and grits.  She never used coffee.

Not very good at all.  It didn't thicken up enough for me and tasted very bitter.  We ended up dumping it out and just eating the ham plain.

I absolutely loved the flavor of the coffee with the ham.  It turned out perfect for the 2 of us and the little bit of leftover ham was even better!

Sounded interesting but I've decided I love black coffee and coffee ice cream... not so much coffee gravy. I made it with dark roast beans (Sumatra) and the flavor was present but somewhat overwhelmed by the ham. I think the thickness was where it was supposed to be, but it may have been more appealing if it was a little thicker. I had to taste the gravy alone to really get an idea of the flavor. Not bad but it likely won't get a redo.

This was fantastic. Just used a pat or two of butter, like others previously suggested, and maybe 1/3 cup of strong coffee.  No salt was needed, because the ham and butter already had plenty.  Using less coffee just meant it turned into more of a glaze as it reduced. Reminded me of my childhood and weekends with my grandparents.

I had red eye gravy last night for the first time at a local restaurant. It was served over shrimp, grits and andouille sausage. It was one of the best things that I have ever put in my mouth! I set out to replicate it this morning and was very pleased with the results. Being a pseudo-southerner who was raised on milk gravy, I was not too Concerned with authenticity. I used butter instead of oil, smoked sausage instead of ham, thickened it with flour and added hot sauce and pepper for a little kick. It was soooo good served over grits and sausage with a little shaving of Parmesan over the top!

Tasty! Never made red-eye gravy before, so wasn't sure what to expect. I personally think I will use a little less oil next time.
