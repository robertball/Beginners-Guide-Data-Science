wow, this was surprising. I really didn't think it would be good at all but I'm glad I tried it because I never would have thought of this combo and it's awesome! a nice alternative to the standard vinegar and soy sauce style of preparing kale. I could also see this working well with citrus like grapefruit instead of kiwi. lots of potential here.

Yummy! I love the flavor combo of these powerhouse foods together. The only thing I did different was to use KerryGold grass fed butter instead of coconut oil because I was out. The tanginess of the kiwi really complimented the ginger and garlic. This one is a winner.

Pleasantly surprised! Turned out very tasty. I didn't have fresh oregano on hand so used Sage and Savory dried Greek oregano. Slice almonds (not blanched) worked fine. The garlic browned up very quickly so watch that closely. Next time I will use 3-4 kiwis (I think mine were small). I also used 2 tsp ginger rather than 1 tsp because I love ginger. This recipe was my low calorie side to tomato-red pepper soup and it was perfect.

Man, this was good. 
 I was looking for a recipe as a side dish with our steak, and was trying to use up what was in my fridge.  I looked up "kale", and found this.  It sounded pretty sketchy, but I made it anyway.  I didn't have fresh oregano, but I had fresh cilantro, so I used that with the same measurements. 
It turned out delicious!!  It has a sort of citrus-y taste and the ginger is fantastic.  I highly recommend you try this.  I tossed some fresh diced mango on top, perfect.  This will definitely be a new staple side dish.

This recipe looked so interesting I just had to try it.  I doubled the ingredients (for four servings) and made it as written except for using curly kale and substituted 1 tbsp dried oregano for the fresh. Sorry, but nobody in my family including myself cared for it. The oregano was especially overpowering, and the kiwi tasted like very sour lemon. If I ever make this again I think I'd cut the oregano way down and use only half (or less) of the kiwi called for.

I didn’t have kiwi so I substituted diced apple instead, and even then it was wonderful! I was looking for something I had in the house that could give more of the tangy flavour of kiwi, so I sprinkled some with craisens. Both ways were delicious! But now I want to buy kiwi and try it again - can’t wait!

It's delicious and unique. I put it in the fridge and eat it cold. I like how the kiwi with the coconut oil makes its own dressing. I use red kale because I don't like larcinato.

This was very nice. I added a small number of blackberries that needed to be used up& tried lo-cal bacon crumbles on it. Both worked well. It took longer than 5minutes for the kale to be as wilted as I desired but it was still a quick dish to make.
