Very good! Though the ingredient list seems a bit long, it is really easy to throw together. The only thing that I would do differently next time is add some chopped green onions, as I felt it was missing that extra flavor. I made homemade ranch for this, and that was nice. I would make this one again! Thanks for sharing.:)
