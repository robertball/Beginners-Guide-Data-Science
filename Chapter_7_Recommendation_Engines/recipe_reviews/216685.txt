My boyfriend turned me on to ham barbecue after I spent my whole life thinking that it was a gross idea.  My loss.  This is cheap, delicious, and a definite crowd pleaser.  It's even better the next day, when everything's thickened up!

As a Pittsburgh-er, I can say that these are really good! The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that that is waaaaay too much sauce for only 1 pound of chipped ham. I'm glad that I went w/ my instincts and 1/2'd the sauce part, b/c it would've been a waste of the extra ingredients. Other than that, these were very tasty, had great flavor and I loved the convenience of using the slow cooker...I cooked mine on low for 3 hrs. and that was perfect. I didn't find these too sweet at all, just right! Thanks for sharing this recipe...I WILL be making these again! :)

Mom is from pittsburgh and she said they were on the money. As for me who didn't come from pittsburgh it was lacking. I'm not sure how to make it better but will keep messing with it as it made mom happy. Only change was the sauce was really runny so we added another pound of ham to it

This was a great barbecue sandwich! Very tangy and a hint of sweet. I scaled this down to 1 serving and it came out with just the right amount of sauce to meat. I added sweet relish to the mix rather than adding it on top. I used shaved mesquite smoked ham. My PA friends relocated here tell me that "chipped" ham isn't available here in Texas so I can't say how this would compare to what they are used to, but I thought it was really good and certainly a keeper! Thanks for the great recipe, this is delicious!

Only used one bottle of chili sauce or it would be too runny
