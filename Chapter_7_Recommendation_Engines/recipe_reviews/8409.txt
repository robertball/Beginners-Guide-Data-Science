As long as you DO NOT MELT the butter, this recipe is very good. I used a whole bar of white chocolate (3.6 oz), melted and cooled. The butter was at room temp, as was the milk, and I used an electric mixer for about 3 minutes. It was enough to frost a two-layer cake.

DO NOT MELT THE BUTTER!!!  I was in a serious time crunch and realized too late that melting the butter was a HUGE mistake!  To modify:  melt the white chocolate and blend in to frosting AFTER adding confectionery sugar.  The flavor is awesome..I put this on a white chocolate cake filled with dark chocolate ganache and topped with chocolate shavings.

Although a good recipe, it really is not a frosting but rather an icing. To me this is a big difference and can be inconvenient if unexpected.

Turns out as more of a glaze than an icing and was wayy to sweet. I Ended up drizzling it over some fresh whipped cream as a glaze instead and it was just the right amount of sweet.
Watch the servings too this recipe makes ALOT (even when halved)

This came out flavorful and the perfect consistency. Do not melt your butter if you want this to be light and creamy!

Wonderful taste, needed more confectioners' sugar. I added almost 5 cups to get it to hold, and even then it was runny. I used softened butter like another reviewer suggested, I think it helped. And it's not going to be white frosting, more of a mocha color.

It was not white as the picture indicates and I had to add a whole lot of confectioners sugar to thicken it, it was still very thin

I followed suggestions and didn't melt the butter, and had to add twice as much icing sugar to make it stiff enough to decorate with.  Turned out a "mocha" colour - use white vanilla if available, and 1/2 the instant coffee.  I would double the white chocolate next time, since after all the other changes, the coffee taste overpowered any chocolate flavour.  I will try this again, but I assume that since the original poster "threw" this together, the quantities were estimates, after-the-fact.

It was wayto liquid-y. Added more sugar, but it didn't work. The taste was awesome, though.
