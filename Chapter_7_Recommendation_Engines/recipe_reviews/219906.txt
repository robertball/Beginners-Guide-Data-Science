Nothing like an 85 degree evening in Seattle, drinking a Bill's Famous Mai Tai on the front porch.  This IS like a Hawaiian vacation in a glass.  Light, refreshing and deliciously rummy.  Thank you Bill!  I can't wait to try the other "Bill's Famous" drinks.

I made this for a sit down murder mystery party in a big container and it was sucked down so fast I had to stop and make another batch.  GREAT recipe thank you! P.S. we added far more booze :-)
