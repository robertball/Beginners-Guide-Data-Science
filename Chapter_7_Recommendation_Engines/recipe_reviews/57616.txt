I made this for the 1st time for a pot luck lunch and it was a big hit. I used a blender, instead of a food processor, with excellent results.

This recipe was easy, fast and tasted great. My son who does not eat carrots loved it!! I am a vegetarian and I LOVED it :-)
We all know that Carrots' antioxidant compounds help protect against cardiovascular disease and cancer and also promote good vision, especially night vision. I can't think of a tastier way to include carrots' in our diet!Thanks for sharing this recipe!

After going to a restaurant serving carrot souffle in Lakeland, Florida, I found this receipe and decided to give it a try.  Gave some to our neighbor who went with us and we all agreed that it was better than the souffle served at the restaurant.

I really enjoyed this souffle.  I made it for two people instead of eight and served it in two small souffle dishes.  I added vanilla because of the description.  I'm glad I did. I also added a dash of nutmeg and the two together were perfect.  This is a great tasty way to get some veggies in.

Absolutely stellar!  I used only 1/2 cup of brown sugar, but otherwise did not change anything.  I cannot thank Deanna enough for submitting this recipe.  If you're looking for a fluffy, delicate, wholesome side dish, look no further.  This is it!

I've never cooked anything other then boiling some noodles for some mac 'n cheese.  Made this for my girlfriend because it's her favorite dessert.  She said it's exactly how she liked it.  Very good recipe!!

I really liked this recipe, but as always I had to make it my own.  To personalize it by adding 3 parsnips and 1 red beet (I was sure to stick with root veggies).  The beet added a great new dimention to the color, while the parsnip replaced some of the carrots.  It was a great success!  Thanks

Yum! Easy and delicious.  A grating of fresh nutmeg really set the flavor off. Everyone raved.  The dish was emptied.

Made this tonight with a friend's old blender.  I would recommend mashing carrots and then blending, or blending in smaller batches if you don't have a food processor.  Reduced sugar to 1/2 cup and added vanilla.  Perfect and easy, my first souffle and it was a great success.

My mother-in-law said she wanted some different dishes on our Thanksgiving menu, so I chose this to replace the sweet potato casserole. I was pretty nervous about it - but it was a huge hit! Everyone thought it was absolutely delicious, and I made it exactly as written. I thought this one sounded better than all the others due to the brown sugar, and I am glad I went with this one. It was creamy, fluffy, perfectly sweetened, and baked beautifully. Just perfect, thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

I just mixed this up to put in the oven tomorrow morning to take for Thanks Giving dinner.  I can tell already by just tasting the 'batter' that- if it cooks up well- it is going to be delicious!  I doubled the recipe and made it in 2 batches.  I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla to the first batch, but did not like the taste, so did not add to the 2nd batch.  About 1/4 to 1/2 tsp of cinnimon really brought out the flavor of the carrot (and masked the vanilla that I didn't like) without adding obvious taste of cinnamon.  I can't wait to taste the final product!

I did alter the recipe... I steamed the carrots and I used 2 TBL butter/margerine- instead of 1/2 cup, 2 eggs-instead of 3 eggs, 1/3 cup brn sugar-instead of 3/4 cup.  Added 1 tsp. vanilla. Then sprinkled some brown sugar on top. Everything else was the same and baked in a glass 1 1/2 quart dish on 325F.

My family loves this recipe (I think it is okay) and I make it often.  I use a blender and it makes a great consistancy. I always make it with 3 cans of carrots instaed of raw to save on time.   I just noticed that the submitter says vanilla in the description but there isn't any in the ingredients? Maybe I will add some next time.

This soufflé has become a staple at my Thanksgiving table. It's absolutely delicious and surprisingly easy. I wouldn't count it as a veggie, but it's well worthy of dessert.

This was the first time i ever made a souffle and i am proud of myself. I made it for Thanksgiving dinner and it was good. Some of my family just do not want to try new things they kept making excuses  not to try. But i am persistent and at least got them to try a table spoon and they found out it was not as bad as they thought. Thanks.

This was delicious.  I substituted Splenda brown sugar blend for the sugar, and used about 3/4 of the called-for amount of margarine.  I also scaled this down for two people.  The souffle was creamy, fluffy, and sweet, so there was no way to tell that I had healthified the recipe.  Thanks for a great base recipe!

This was a strange recipe to us at first but once we made it, it was a big hit.  A lot like sweet potato or pumpkin casserole, but with a lighter texture.  We had a bunch of leftover carrots that we didn't want to waste, and this was the perfect solution.

I think it would have been a bit tastier with vanilla.  I did use equal parts of brown sugar, white sugar and Splenda because so many others said it was too sweet.  I plan to try it with the brown sugar only.  Overall a good recipe!

Thanks for sharing a great recipe! I followed recommendations of other reviewers by adding only 1/2 cup of light brown sugar and putting the mix in a blender. It was definitely sweet enough. I took it to a family cookout and everyone loved it. Getting a grocery list together so I can cook it again and take it as a side dish/dessert for Thanksgiving :)

This dish came out deliciously smooth, just a bit sweet. Everyone loved it, and I have a picky crowd! I don't have a food processor, so I whipped it up in my KitchenAid. It had a few little lumps, which didn't detract from how good it tasted.

Have made this for many years with regular sugar. Had some Splenda brown sugar and decided to go with that. Was superb!
