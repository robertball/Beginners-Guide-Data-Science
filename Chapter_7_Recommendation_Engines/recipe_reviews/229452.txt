Wow! I always say that you can't go wrong with a Chef John recipe and this one did not disappoint. I have a really picky husband and sons and my husband told me twice that this was "awesome" and both my boys, who are 6 & 8, ate every piece of meat I put on their plates. 
I made this just as directed with no changes, EXCEPT that I grilled over propane because I don't have a charcoal grill. According to Chef John's video I can't call this Tuscan since I didn't use charcoal, but it tasted pretty darn fabulous anyways! This is a keeper.

I make this almost every month. My hubby can't can't get enough.  He even came up with the idea of buying several steaks, marinating them, then freezing.  That way we can have them in a moments notice!  Tastes just as good!

I really liked the flavor of the marinade, but they were just to subtle to stand out on beef. We're thinking it will be to die for on chicken!

My wife and I love this marinade.  I was a little concerned at how much rosemary was being added as it has a strong flavor.  The mixture of ingredients really works well together.  I have used this marinade on both flank steak and chicken and again we love.  This will be one of my goto recipe's - Thank you Chef John for sharing!!!

I made this recipe last night for my brother-in-law and my sister, with roasted garlic cauliflower and baked asparagus as sides.  It came out very tasty and was well appreciated by all.  I didn't modify it but did add just a little extra splash of olive oil to the marinade as it was a bit thick in my blender.  I'll be making this again for sure.

Of course, I didn't have all the ingredients, I had dried rosemary, only let it marinade for 2 hours.  I have to say it wasn't as good the night we made it.  I had plenty of leftovers so I cut it up, warmed it and placed it in tortillas with colby/jack cheese, southwestern salad mix with dressing.  It was tasty.  It is nice to actually use leftovers.

Really easy to prepare.  If you get a great cut of meat, it cannot fail.  The meat marinated in a large Ziplock bag, brushing on the paste while in the bag (really easy).  It was cooked at 450 degrees F and was 5 minutes per side, turning out just right.

I didn't have flank steak so I used a choice tri-tip and pounded it out some. It was excellent. Next time I'll have flank.

Thank you Chef John! I look forward to trying this and I will post another recipe for flank steak as well.  This cut definitely requires a marinade.-Annie

This is really flavorful.  The citrus and rosemary create bright flavors for the rich meat.

Tried this for the first time tonight. It was awesome! Didn't have rosemary, so I used summer savory. Very flavorful.

I made this recipe with no changes.  I don't know if it was the flank steak I purchased or what, but it was so tough we couldn't chew it, and no I did not over cook it.  Maybe it would work better with a different cut of beef, but I also found it just was not very flavorful and I marinated it for 8 hours.

Quite possibly the best marinated steak I've ever had. I have no idea if it was the local, grass fed beef or the marinade but together it was incredible.

Delicious result but not sure what makes it "Tuscan" or stand out from other flank steak recipes. I couldn't really taste the rosemary even though there's tons of it in the marinade and dressing. It tasted like other flank steak recipes I've tried. I'll make it again, and maybe let it marinade longer (9 hours this go).

I limited the spice, and was too lazy to baste the steak while cooking it.  It was still very good.

Not a bad recipe. It is a good marinade - the only thing I didn't do was baste the steak as it was cooking, but it still turned out very moist. Next time I will do the basting, as it was a little lackluster in flavor.

We made this a week ago, but used it with chicken - what wonderful flavor! We split a whole chicken, then marinated each half in heavy freezer bags. The next day one half was grilled and we  froze the second half - this is definitely my favorite grilled chicken now! (Now we need to try this again with flank steak.)

I added more lemon, olive oil and dried garlic, additional red pepper flakes...
For the brush marinade - extra lemon/olive oil.  1 clove garlic smashed w/dried onion added to mixture. Oregano/rosemary/basil/extra salt.
Only added extra spices and lemon, because when I smelled the marinade, I couldn't smell any flavor.  I felt like I needed to punch it up.

Having never prepared or even bought a flank steak before, this was by far, the best choice.  The marinade totally makes it!

It was excellent! No changes needed. My boyfriend was skeptical, saying flank steak is always tough. Not this recipe! We will definitely make again.

Excellent!  Made this today for Memorial Day family gathering and it was a hit!  I used the same amount for two 1.5 lbs of flank steak in case the flavors were a bit overpowering since I have not made it before.  Greatest compliment is when kids (ages 3-13) gobbled it up!

Made 3 flank stakes for super bowl followed the recipe and it was right on target. Put on the Char-griller akorn at 400° 8 min.per side let it rest sliced it and the crowd went wild very little left over. Only thing I did different was used A1 stake sauce instead of the lemon olive oil mix.Will be making this again.

Try this! You won't regret it! I found a flank steak in my freezer and knew I was going to try this recipe. I love every ingredient in this marinade recipe and know that combined it would taste great. I, however, was a bit skeptical at the amount of rosemary in this recipe. 1/2 cup of rosemary is a LOT of rosemary. But I followed this recipe to the letter and haven't looked back. My steak happened to be a tenderized flank steak from an Amish meat market in Ohio. It turned out absolutely delicious and very tender and cooked to the perfect pinkness in the middle by following Chef John's 6-8 minute recommendation. I really think you're missing out on some great flavor if you don't grill this on charcoal. The marinade was just perfect and the charcoal added a great depth of flavor you just can't get on a gas grill! But don't let that stop you from trying this.  Thanks Chef John. Pure deliciousness!

this was ok, but the olive oil wasn't a good taste after it was grilled.  i normally use a tasteless oil (canola or veg.) and let the other flavors come through, not the oil. ok but i'll use my marinade next time
