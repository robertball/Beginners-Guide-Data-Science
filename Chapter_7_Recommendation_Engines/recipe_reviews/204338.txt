This is a great easy recipe to use while camping, just throw everything in your dutch oven and voila you have a delicious substantial meal in a short time.  The only thing I changed about this recipe was I cut the sauerkraut in half, and still thought it was plenty.  Two cans would have been way over the top in my book.  And this probably goes without saying, but this recipe goes way past 5 stars just by complementing it with a nice beer-- they should have added that to the recipe list!

Made this for a potluck and it got rave reviews.  I did not add the potatoes as I was to bring a "meat" dish.  I only had one apple, and one bag of refrigerated sauerkraut.  I threw it all in my slow cooker for ease of cooking/transport, and it was a big hit!  Thanks for the great recipe.

The combination of the kraut and the apples is very tasty!  I was not sure if I should have rinsed the kraut or not.  I did not rinse it but added a tablespoon of brown sugar, as it was too tart.  What are refrigerated potatoes?  Not sure....I used regular potatoes and cooked the dish for an hour.  I will surely make this recipe again!

At first I was leery with the apples, but this was a great mix of sweet and sour.  I did knock the sauerkraut to 1 can and it was perfect.  Oh! And make sure you drain the 'kraut!!!  My husband loved it and I even got seconds (not normal for me).  Will definitely be using this recipe again!

This was quite yummy even though my husband and I don't care for sauerkraut.  I used a can of potatoes instead of the refrigerated ones and it came out great.

I followed the recipe exactly but I put it in a greased dish and cooked for 1/2 h at 350 after I fried up sausage and onion and it didnt turn out that great- later I put some in a frying pan with scrambled eggs and added ketchup and it was really good.

I used to make a recipe similar to this, and it never turned out quite right.  Simmering in the apple juice made the difference!  Delicious!

It was very good. I chose to put everything in a baking dish and put it in the oven covered until the potatoes were tender. It was quick to prepare. I used red potatoes and I cubed my apples. The only recipe change I made (other than baking it) was that I added a couple extra tablespoons of butter. I know, not as healthy but yummy!

The flavor of this dish was balanced between sweet, sour, and smokey.  It was so easy to make, although I used fresh potatoes and I had to simmer them for almost an hour before they were tender.  I would definitely make this again!

We loved this take on the usual kielbasa and sauerkraut! I did peel my apples, because I don't like cooked apple skins, I omitted the potatoes because I was serving another potato dish to go along with it and I opted to bake it in the oven at 350 degrees for about 40 mins. or so. The flavors were wonderful, and I will definately be using this recipe again! Thanks for sharing. :)
