I make this literally 3 times a month. My family loves these wings. Of course I have changed some things due to the kids not tolerating the spiciness. I use regular ketchup, no chilli powder and sometimes I don't add the smoke flavor cuz I forget. lol. I do this recipe in a rush and it WORKS!  I don't use exact measurements I add some of everything else and add depending on flavor and how much sauce I am trying to make. I only have four in my family so I make a small 7 pack of wings divided in pieces to make enough for everyone. Thank you so much for this recipe its great and its better then spending $9 on a order at the pizzeria = }

It was very good! I halted it to make fewer wings. Added a drizzle of olive oil and salt and peppers to wings before baking them.

I only made the sauce (as I did not have wings and ran out of 
BBQ sauce for something else on the grill)... 
Let me say, this sauce was fantastic!  I had to make a couple of changes due to ingredients I did not have: left out liquid smoke and swapped hot/spicy ketchup for regular ketchup (added a dash of hot sauce to make up for this). So much better than bottled sauces, and hubby commented on how good it was too. Thanks for a great recipe!  Will be making this again :)

We loved these!  The flavor is good and bold.  
I donâ€™t have spicy ketchup, so substituted part ketchup & part Asian sweet chili sauce, which has a little bite to it.  I agree that the molasses is key to this recipe. They have a sticky gooeyness  we really liked. They were very juicy and tender. Next time I may shave a bit of time off the slow cooker, as they were almost falling off the bones.

I wanted to grill these wings, so I made the sauce (boiling it down made it super thick), marinated the wings, and then grilled. The sauce stuck well, and created delightfully sticky wings, and the molasses gave it a depth of flavor you don't usually associate with wings. However, it was just too sweet for me to fully enjoy. Next time, I'd cut the honey.

Delicious!!! The sauce is fantastic!  I did put them back in the oven after the slow cooker for about 10 minutes at 400 to get them to the "sticky" stage as that is preferred. The meat was fall of the bone tender so I might go a little shorter on the time in the slow cooker next time to keep them in one piece.  I will definitely be making this again....soon!

Made it as called for in the recipe but I didn't put in the slow cooker after. I put them in a chafing dish at a tailgate party. Everyone loved them. Just the right amount of heat.

Loved these!  I made 4 different wing recipes for Superbowl Sunday and being able to use a slow cooker made things lots easier.  I didn't use all the sauce on the wings cause I made fewer so I put the extra sauce in a bottle so I can use it on whatever later.   Will definately make again!
