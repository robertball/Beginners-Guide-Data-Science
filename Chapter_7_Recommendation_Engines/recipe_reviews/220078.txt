I have never made Risotto, until now! This recipie was so easy, and extremely tasty! My kids loved it, and they don't usually like asparagus! I will make it again!

I have never made Risotto before, but I hear it being used in a lot of movies I've watched.  For the amount of work involved, because I had to constantly stir the rice, It was not worth the time.  I don't know if I can make risotto in my rice maker.  That would make this an instant 5 star.   We really liked it mainly because it already included our vegetable servings and the sausage/veggie combo was delicious.  I think I'll do this again maybe just using basmatti rice or quinoa and see how it turns out.   No photo this time.  My camera froze and I lost everything during the reset.

This was ok. It was good, but nothing special and a lot of work for what it was. I may or may not make it again.

If you've made risotto before then you know it will take a lot of stirring and extra time, and this recipe was well-worth the effort.  The taste is fresh and yummy because of the fresh asparagus, peas and mushroom.  The creaminess comes from the risotto if you stirred it enough!  Even reheated the next day, this dish will be a staple in my family-loved it because the sausage gave it the spices and flavors that it needed.  Thanks, Johnsonville!

I've made this dish quite a few times and really enjoyed it.  However, the directions never tell you when to put the asparagus in.  I almost forgot about the asparagus as I was following along with the recipe.

This was great - although next time I definitely won't use the added oil - the sausage was plenty greasy to cook the onions. Also didn't have arborio rice so used brown instead, knowing it wouldn't get to the creamy consistency of risotto, but that was ok. Still turned out to be a great meal (even with canned asparagus since I didn't have fresh)l.

Just about any dish with Johnsonville Italian Sausage is going to be good. And this one is fantastic! I left out the peas, so I added a bit more fresh asparagus to compensate. The rice was cooked al dente. I'd recommend using imported Italian cheese. After you try the real thing, nothing else tastes as good. It's the difference between a good dish and a great one!

I only gave this a four star because I tweaked it a bit to my family's tastes and what was in my fridge. It was a huge hit though with the kids. It was a lot of stirring but I feel it was well worth the effort because that was the hardest part!

I substituted Italian Chicken Sausage and omitted the mushrooms and peas. I did not have any fresh asparagus so I had to check the freezer for what I had. I added a medley of veggies (broccoli, yellow and orange carrots, snow peas, zucchini and yellow squash). It came out amazing! I have to admit, I had never made risotto before and I will definitely be doing that again. so creamy and yummy!
