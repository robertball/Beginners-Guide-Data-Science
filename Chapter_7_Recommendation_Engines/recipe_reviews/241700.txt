I love the savory waffle recipe.  It's very tasty.  If you think covering a chicken nugget in it is too outrageous just eat it as a waffle!  But pretty good with a chicken nugget inside too!

Good stuff! You're supposed to cook the chicken nuggets in the oven before making the waffles. So if your oven is broken and you didn't cook the chicken prior to putting them in the batter and making the waffles, you didn't do the recipe correctly. Should you really be reviewing something you didn't even follow the directions for?...

I made this very easy but used my 3-in-1 sandwich maker waffle plate and it came out well. I reduced some quantities of the ingredients. for the chicken, i mixed the diced chicken with the prepared mixture before cooking so the chicken is embedded in the waffle so I'll call mine the "Secret Chicken Waffles"

Meh, it is what it is. In my case, the oven was broken; and this seemed like a cool idea.  It still seems like a cool idea.  But in this case, the sum is not greater than the parts.
