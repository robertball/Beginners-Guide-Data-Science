this is always a great comfort meal, from breakfast to dinner! the only thing I do different is to lightly brown the corned beef in a little oil, then remove it from the skillet and then follow the the recipe, browning the beef brings the flavor out a little better!

My mother made this all the time when I was young.  I put a small amount of oil in the skillet and crumble up the canned corned beef and chopped onion and let it brown a little then add the flour, cooking it just a bit and then and the milk making a thick gravy that is great over baked potatoes or cooked cabbage.  If your family is like mine and don't like the texture of onions cheat by grating the onion or use minced onions in the recipe.

My Mom made this a lot growing up, but we added pepper and ate it on open faced toast.  She called it Chipped Beef on Toast, Dad said in the military it's called "SOS" for Sh** On a Shingle.... Whatever it's called, it's good!  I like to also use a package of ham lunch meat instead of the corned beef.  It's great for brunch or breakfast too! : )

Amazing!  I used left over corned beef that we had in the crock pot the day before and just chopped it up.  I really cduldn't believe how good this was, and I am a very picky/particular cook.  More flavor than expected and no modifications needed.

I have to say I was VERY surprised at how tasty this turned out!  I served them on open faced toast.  The kids gobbled it down much faster then the roast it was leftover from.

Great recipe.. I tweeked it a little... I fried thinley sliced potato's (about 2 cups), drained then added the rue and chipped beef at the very end added some sliced hardboiled egg. I agree with others here limit the use of salt the beef is salty enould did use pepper... Great for crowds/brunch

My mom always made this version of "SOS" with dried beef on open faced toast. I find it much better with the corned beef. I added a little pepper and served open faced. Yummy

This is so easy and tasty for someone who had corned beef but didn't have a clue what to do with it.
