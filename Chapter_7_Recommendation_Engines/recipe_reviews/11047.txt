Delicious crust; we love the pecan shortbread taste.  I used a half of a container of Cool Whip for the whipped topping.  Next time I will double the cream cheese & whipped topping mixture so it is thicker and can stand up to that "steal the show" crust!  I made my own blueberry pie topping from freshly-picked blueberries (boiled/dissolved 1 c. sugar & 1/2 c. water, then added 3 c. blueberries, 1 T. lemon juice and 1/4 t. cinnamon and cooked for several minutes.  Thickened with cornstarch dissolved in 1-2 T. of cold water) and got many compliments on a delicious dessert.

Follow the recipe to the letter.The only thing I changed was the time on the crust. Instead of 20mins I put it on for 30min. It gave the crust a more cruncher texture. It was easy to make and my family just loved it!

This really does taste like cheesecake bars.  I made them for work because I had a package of cream cheese that needed used up.  The only subsitution I made was that I used coolwhip rather than the packaged stuff you whip yourself.  Excellent, they were gone almost right after I put them out.

Very good and very easy.  I prefer the "Cherry Nut Delight" recipe, however.

I used double the cream cheese filling, used one container of whipped cream in the tub, and doubled the cherry filling.  It was AMAZING

Lower Cal Version: The crust is best with real butter of course, but replace sugar with splenda. For the filling, I used a tub and a half of light cool whip, low fat cream cheese, splenda and then topped with light cherry filling.  People think I go to alot of trouble when I make this.  Super easy and AWESOME!!!

Not too pretty but good and easy. Not too sweet either so great for my diabetic dad. Although I am sure it isn't really diabetic friendly. The pecans add a good flavor. I think I might try almonds next time and maybe add abou 1/4 tsp. almond flavoring to the cream cheese mixture.

Excellent. I used walnuts the second time I made this, since I had no pecans; they worked fine. My guests loved this. Could use a few more cherries, though.
