This is very good. I bet cashews would work here if you are out of sunflower seeds. The lime gives it an edge. I added some extra sunflower seeds before popping it in the oven for some extra crunch. Next time, I will definitely add some cauliflower. Thank you for the recipe.

Amazing recipe! Donâ€™t expect it to taste anything like Mac and cheese but everybody I shared this meal with loved it! I think the recipe could have been written in a much less confusing way as it made it kind of hectic to make because I had to calculate a lot of measurements that should have been plainly stated in the later part of the recipe but the meal itself is stellar. Definitely going to be making this again soon.

Pretty good concept - I added a few more vegetables.
