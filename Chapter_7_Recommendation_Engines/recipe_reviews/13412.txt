This is the best onion soup ever.  It taste like Outback's Creamy Onion Soup.  Add alitte shredded cheese at the end and you're dining in the outback.

This is great as is, although I didn't ever use paprika. I also played with this a bit the second time I made it - sauteeing the onoins until they were quite dark and caramelized, and using vegetable broth instead of chicken broth (the dark onions added the fullness that was missing when I took out the chicken broth, I think. All in all, an easy onion soup recipe that can be adjusted to suit different tastes.

We had an unexpected cold snap here in Texas & I had some vidalias so I tried this recipe out...it was a bit sweet (it's a subtle sweet not a sugary sweet) but it was sooo good. I used 3 very large vidalias, 2% milk & low sodium chicken broth & only 2 of the egg yolks (not sure what if anything they contributed...I couldn't taste the diff & next time will leave them out). I added a bit more hot sauce & garnished w/ sliced green onions instead of parsley. I topped it w/ some parmesan cheese but I don't know if that's the right kind of cheese...perhaps cheddar would be better. I simmered it in chicken broth longer than called for (hubby was working late & I simmered until he walked through the door...about 30/45 minutes) but I think that just broke the onions down more. I did not puree any of the soup & I don't think it really needed it. (maybe because the onions were simmered for so long). I had planned on hitting it w/ some brandy as suggested but forgot until it was too late to add it. I served this w/ garlic toast, which worked perfectly to counteract the sweetness of the soup.

My family enjoyed this recipe and will make it again, I would however double the amount of onions that I used; I will probably use 1 or 2 white onion as the soup may get to sweet using all Vidalia’s. The onions that I used the first time would be what I consider medium size (about the size of a hardball). I like the idea in T.PROCTOR’S review of adding cognac – will try that next time also. Thanks Holly!

This was a wonderful, creamy soup.  I added a little bit of cognac while I sauted the onions and I did do the extra step of blending about a third of the soup then adding it back.  I will absolutely make this recipe again.  It would be wonderful for entertaining.  We had it as a meal with a spinach/strawberry salad (recipe on this site) and french bread.  Thanks for sharing!

This soup was the star of a big dinner party (even the beef wellington took second seat)  Cook the onions until well carmalized and use fresh paparika (smoked or roasted parika is best).  To really bring out the flavor, add 1/8 to 1/4 cup of maderia or brandy. Perfect!

I have a recipe very similar to this. I don't add egg yolks or hot sauce to mine though. Another nice trick is to let it cool a bit and put it in a blender so that it truelly is a creamy soup then reheat. The look is more pleasing as well as the texture. When making for guests I make thin fried onion rings as a garnish for the center.

This soup has a wonderful flavour.  I omitted the eggs and found the texture to be perfect.  Can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch today.

When I made this I followed the recipe pretty closely.   I used sweet onions, but they weren’t Vidalias and it took me a full 30 minutes before they reached a nice golden caramelized color.  I skipped the eggs as suggested by several other reviewers.  This wasn’t too sweet for us at all, but overall it was just ok.  When I asked Hubs if I should save the leftovers for him he said no, which in my view is not a good sign, so I’m sure I won’t be making this one again.

I did have to change some things...but great base.  Didn't have cream so I used a pinch of sugar and 2% milk.  Also added carrots, Dried oregano, parsley and basil, no paprika or hot sauce.  Pretty tasty!!

This was good. Since I alter everything to be gluten free, this was no exception. To do this skip the roux. Follow the recipe otherwise, except using 1 tbsp less butter. Reserve 1/2 cup of the milk and save for the end (before the eggs if you are using them). Mix the reserved 1/2 cup of milk with 1 tbsp of corn starch and stir in. Stir frequently to thicken. Then add the eggs if you are not omitting them. Thanks for sharing! Very good use for Vidalia onions that need to be used. Topped with cheddar cheese and it's a very filling meal!

Very creamy, decent flavor.  Not my favorite but it is a nice recipe.  A bit of time goes into preparing this.  The jury is still out as to whether or not I would make again.

Very easy and delicious! I followed the recommendations and left out the egg and it was still wonderful. I also used 2 cups beef bullion instead of the chicken broth to give it a really rich flavor and skim milk and half n half. The onions soaked up the flavor and just melted in my mouth. Oh so good! I served this with hot garlic cheese Texas toast. Thanks for a great way to warm up my day! Yummo! Definitely a keeper. Also tried topping with cheddar cheese...excellent!

Chopped instead of sliced the onions. Double the butter. Beef broth instead of chicken. Three cloves of garlic chopped. Sauté onions for 30 minutes over high heat. Simmer broth and onion for one hour. Turn off heat after adding eggs. Season per recipe and refrigerate overnight. Reheat and serve with parsley and grated parmesan. SLAP MY FACE GOOD!

I modified a bit... I didn't have heavy cream so I used skim milk, 1 1/2 cups and added about 3 oz flavored cream cheese to thicken. I used southwest flavor, but all of them are good. also I added mushrooms for texture before the egg yolk. Turned out great, I wish I would have doubled the recipe!!

I thought this soup was just OK. For those who wonder, it DID NOT taste like Outbacks creamy onion soup. I tasted this without the eggs and it was very, very watery, but once I added them the soup was a great consistency. Flavorwise, this was very sweet, and the onion flavor was presented nicely, but I just wasn't crazy about it, and I know it's pyschological, but knowing there was eggs in it just bothered me. I won't make it again.

The onions smelled great when cooking and tasted good with the broth, but once the cream was added it got too sweet for my taste.  I think in hindsight, I could have left the cream out and added some beef broth or more chicken broth for a broth based soup.  I enjoyed making it and trying something new though!

Excellent! I used beef broth instead of chicken, to make it more reminiscent of French onion soup. Very creamy and delicious.

This was very tasty.  Browning the onions was a nice touch.  It enhanced the flavor a lot.  I used 2% milk and found it to be great.  I think the half and half would make it tooooo rich.

Very good.  It's very sweet.  I used 2 large onions because once I started chopping it seemed like that was enough.  I didn't add the egg and it seemed fine.  I also used the immersion blender to chop it up a bit.  My husband thought it was great too!

This soup is unbelievable - especially for onion lovers. YUM! I used six medium onions and took out the heavy cream and paprika.

What a great flavor this recipe has!  The Vidalia onions contribute an interesting slightly sweet taste.  I loved it.  I only used 3 onions but that worked well. This is a recipe that will be requested more than once!!

I worked at Outback for 4 years - this is super close to the original.  I added No water - used 2% milk, cream and better than bullion chicken flavor.  Carmelize the onions slowly for 30-40 min until they are golden brown...(this is where the recipe time is flawed).  Then I added 1/4 c dry sherry into the onions and cooked for 5 more minutes.  Paprika added GREAT color, then I added crushed red pepper to finish.  DO NOT try to blend hot liquids in a blender (dangerous)- buy an inexpensive immersion blender and blend in the pot - I only blended half the soup keeping some of the onion texture.   You could top this with anything...chives, cheese, brown bread croutons, or even LOBSTER!

I added a few extra dashes of hot sauce and used chicken bone broth for extra protein. This was my first time making onion soup. I Love this recipe!

Very robust & creamy...bought a 15lb. bag of vidalia onions from the Shriners  & made the soup 3 times.  My daughter loved it, my neighbor loved it.  Can't wait  for the Shriners to have their next  onion sale.

My husband & I love onions.  The Vidalia's just came into our grocery stores.  Didn't have any Tabasco sauce, so I added a 1/4 teaspoon of pepper flakes.  Next time I make this I will cut the onions in half and then slice them for easier eating.  I make about 30 different kinds of soup and this one went into the top 10.

It was quite tasty, cheap, and relatively easy to make. As a poor collage student this soup made quite a few great meals.

I used 2 very large regular onions, omitted the egg yolks, and used red pepper flakes instead of paprika. Also, I used a hand blender to puree it a little. This is a wonderfully warming and hearty soup, just perfect for a snowy day. Thanks, Holly!

I made this with high expectations of being like the soup served at The Outback....needless to say, I was very disappointed.  Probably won't make again.

My family really liked this soup a lot.  I found it to be a bit too sweet for my liking.  The recipe didn't state what size onions.  I used 1-1/2 really large ones and that seemed like plenty, but I see from other reviewers that they used 4 large ones and liked it a lot.  Perhaps I would have liked it more with a lot more onions.
