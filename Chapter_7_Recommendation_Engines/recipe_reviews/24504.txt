The Paella came out great.  I added a little bit of sugar to cut the bitter taste of the tomatoe juices.  Overall, really good. Next time I wil add more seafood, i.e. Scallops, and/or clams.

Very easy and tasty.  I used a package of saffron rice instead of white rice because I didn't have any saffron but it still turned out great.  It could use a little more seasoning but it's easy to add your own flavorings.  Also, mine was a little watery so next time I will drain the tomatoes and use a little less broth, but I will definitely make this recipe again

It was okay.  I used saffron yellow rice like others suggested.  I definitely think the chicken broth isn't necessary (I only used a couple of ounces and I think it just made it wet and mushy).  Next time, I'll cook the yellow rice in chicken broth instead of water and not add chicken broth in the end.  I think sauteed onion would be a good addition.  Lastly, I added a large spoon full of capers.

Only had some "Spanish" rice mix for this, so  used it, and added some cumin because of that.  It was a little soupy the first time, but tasted great; the leftovers were the perfect texture!  So I wouldn't decrease the liquid unless you are eating an entire batch right away.  The chicken broth adds complexity, so just reduce amounts of both borth and tomatoes instead of eliminating the broth altogether.

Too much broth, not a lot of flavor.  I'd add mussels or cockles next time, drain the tomatoes, add white pepper and hot sauce.  Also, I'd use saffron yellow rice instead of saffron with white rice.

I'm sorry to have to give this a low rating. It was terribly bland, and I had to add lots of herbs & spices to eat it. I make my rice with broth, in this case fish broth. I therefore found the added chicken broth unnecessary. This reduced the cooking time, which I think was a good thing. Finally, I have a quibble with the title - paella normally includes other ingredients such as chicken, sausage, other seafood. (this is a minor detail - I didn't factor it into the rating.)

Yields 4 VERY SMALL servings.  I doubled the recipe and it was enough for a family of four.  I was out of fresh garlic so sauted onions and used garlic powder.  Has great flavor.  Kids were not big on the soupy look of the dish so I put it in flour tortilla & added sour cream. Makes great shrimp burritos.

This was rather confusing.  It said 1/2 cup of rice but I put in 1 3/4 cup of rice.  Used extra garlic and added peas like another person suggested, drained the tomatoes and added shredded parmesan cheese to give it some flavor.

I know this is totally different from the recipe but I had to do something with it to give it some flavor.

This recipe is a little strange so I altered like many others. I used yellow rice that already had saffron in it. 2 cups of rice in 2 cups water and 2 cups of broth. Did not use broth when simmering shrimp. Only used about 3/4 can of the tomatoes and added about 1/2 can of sweet peas. Also seasoned sautéing shrimp with salt and pepper. Once everything was combined it was the perfect consistency and not mushy at all. Everyone loved it, i.e., no leftovers...

Honestly cooking this was nothing short of a disaster. Very bland and soupy. I had to add 3x the amount of rice to soak up the broth. I couldn’t eat it. I made pasta. Sorry.

So I went by the recipe, but the only thing I changed was adding scallops. I'm not sure I like it. Maybe it's the scallops, maybe not, but I'm not real sure I like it.

Added a third cup of rice and added lemon and black pepper. Was still soupy but cooked down after a while.  Very tasty, will make again. Might add some spicy sausage as well.

This was pretty good. I added some peas, olives, a vegetable stock (for my "vegetarian" friends) and a frozen seafood medley. Thanks for the recipe.
