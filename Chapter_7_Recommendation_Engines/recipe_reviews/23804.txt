This recipe is excellent and is also great with mandarin oranges. My family all loved it also. Have served it many times.

I live in Vermont and can't tell you how great this recipe is!  I would not change a thing.  I made this for Thanksgiving and 18 people all agreed it was astounding.  I just shared the recipe with a maple sugarer!  They are always looking for great new recipes for their spring harvest and here it is!  Thank you so much for this 10 star recipe!  Yes it is sweet but who cares....and dates how yummy!

Super easy and a perfect side for a Thanksgiving meal. I didn't have dates so I substituted 1/2 cup of mandarin oranges and 1/2 cup of chopped maraschino cherries. I will make this again!
