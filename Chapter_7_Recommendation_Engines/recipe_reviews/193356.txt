It's a good dessert if you are having a craving for something fluffy and chocolate without having to turn the oven on (and super easy to make). Instead of using the cups, I had some leftover cupcake liners that I needed to use. The recipe provided makes about 16 cupcake "Soufflés." I also ran out of cherries partway through and used strawberries to decorate. The oreo crust is a bit too dry though and doesn't hold together well so it's a bit messy, so I will most likely add some butter to it to make a more cohesive crust. The key to the "batter" is to make sure you don't overwork the cool whip with the pudding mixture or else it will just lie flat instead of fluffy like normal soufflés.
