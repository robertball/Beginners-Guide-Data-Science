This recipe makes good, healthy muffins.  I use a mixture of brown sugar and regular sugar instead of the "Splenda" sweetener.  I also use two eggs instead of one to make the muffins a bit fluffier.  Good recipe!

I made some minor changes, but on the whole they were very good and moist.  I used all wheat flour, added 2 ripe mashed bananas, used Splenda Brown sugar instead of white and an extra 1/4 C. lowfat milk.  I filled the muffin cups full and they raised beautifully. These have become a easy, healthy favorite in our family.

This is such a great recipe. I halved the oat topping and it was just the right amount. I also added an extra 1/4 cup nonfat milk and extra 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the batter. I used 1.5 cups whole wheat and 1/2 cup white. I got exactly 12 muffins out of it. Since I used more whole wheat flour, I filled the muffin tins up almost full and baked for 25-28 min at 375 instead. They made the house smell great and are a nice healthy treat.

This was my first attempt at low-fat muffins, and they were delicious! Even better after they've sat for a day. I used regular sugar instead of splenda, but I used a little less than suggested. Delicious!

These muffins are delicious! I used sugar instead of the splenda, and didn't do the topping, and they're just wonderful. So healthy too. I found they did make about 30% more than the recipe stated. My kids love these!

I love the taste of apples and cinnamon together, but have never had a muffin with apple pieces in it.  I was a bit hesitant about how this would turn out, but I loved it!  I used real sugar, and cut it back to 1/2 cup.  I still thought it was too sweet, so I'll cut it back even more next time.  The amount of cinnamon was perfect!  1/3 cup milk for 1 1/2 cups flour didn't seem enough, so I added a bit more.  I also used all whole wheat flour because I couldn't find my all purpose flour.  Since the whole wheat flour is heavier, ti didn't rise very much.  The topping was great straight out of the oven, but it got soft the next day.  I only put the topping on half the muffins.

Excellent muffins! Moist and scrumptious! I took some advice from other reviewers and made some changes. I halfed the topping amount and it was about enough to do half the muffins which was good. I used 1 1/2 large apples. I added an egg and added a 1/4 C of milk. These were absolutly wonderful. Thank you so much for the new recipe!

I made these for my family as a quick, out the door breakfast.  They loved them!  I followed the recipe except I used 2 eggs instead of one.  I thought the topping was a little too sweet and may cut back on the amount of sugar substitute next time...I have been asked to prepare them again ASAP.

These are the best! I made a few changes-  doubled the recipe,used all whole wheat flour, I used the reccomendation to add two mashed bananas- that helped with moisture. Also, instead of 2/3 c. milk I used a whole cup. I used 6 small apples and I made half the topping. I put these in texas muffin tins. They were great!

These are delicious!  I've made traditional apple muffins for years, but these are much lighter and cakelike in texture.  I also love the fact that they are low in sugar and fat!  I will be making these again.  Thank you for the recipe.

maybe I did something wrong but these didn't turn out very well. Firstly, they're very dark; they look like chocolate muffins, which I thought was strange. I did everything the same except used raw sugar instead of splenda (I didn't make the topping). I make muffins all the time and these are probably the most disappointing ones I've ever made :(.

These are officially my new favourite muffins! Made 2 batches in a couple days, and they're already gone again. Very moist, flavorful and they look really impressive (just like something you'd get from a coffee shop!).  Looking over the recipe, I did use white sugar in (instead of Splenda) and also added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg to the batter. I also used brown sugar instead of white for the topping. And the first time I made them I used vegetable oil instead of apple sauce, since it's all I had.   Will keep "tweaking" the recipe to my liking, but they're great as is too! I would recommend to anyone looking for a treat :)

These were really delicious!  I don't like when people alter the ingredients and then give it a low star rating, so I try not to alter the recipe much to be fair.  However, I did tweak this somewhat and give it a 5 star because they were sooo delicious.  First, I peeled and chopped the apples and then cooked them in about 2 Tablespoons in light/low fat Blue Bonnet butter just until they were tender, but not soft.  I then threw in some raisins (about 1/3 cup) and cooked that in with the apples.  I followed the rest of the directions exactly, except added a tad more milk than called for, a pinch of nutmeg, a tablespoon of oil (for added fat) and about 2 tablespoons of dry vanilla pudding mix for added moisture (I do this for my boxed cakes as well).  DELICIOUS!!!  I did not make the topping, but I still think these were amazing!

I love this recipe and have made it on more than one occasion!  I use real sugar and have substituted apple butter in place of the applesauce a few times.  It also makes good mini loaves.

One muffin is enough for breakfast. This muffin is very heavy and you get full right away. It's very good and tasty.

I feel bad giving a poor review to these, since everyone else seems to have liked them a lot, but these muffins did not turn out good for me.  They were bland and rubbery.  Perhaps it was something I did - but the only thing I changed was to use real sugar instead of spenda, because that was all I had.  Sorry, but I will not make these again.

Great Combination! We've been cooking with whole wheat flower and sugar substitute my whole life! You can use all whole-wheat or white whole-wheat flour and add oatmeal to the muffin batter itself. It gives the muffin a lovely texture!~ :)

These are so tasty!  I went with white sugar instead of sucralose and made the full amount of topping--the topping baked up super hard but we liked it anyway.  Next time I'll spread it out better.  I used more apple than called for and loved it.

Tastes great but wasn't thinking that with no fat in the recipe that the muffins stick to the backing cups.  Have to make it with greased pans instead.

Very good! I made a few changes! I creamed 1/4c. butter with sugar, and then added maple and vanilla extract. I also added 2 eggs and grated two small apples. I did everything else the same. I didn't make the topping though. I added sanding sugar instead.  Very good, and moist. Will make them again. They are very easy and I would recommanded them to anyone.

I used only one apple and 1/2 cup of white sugar instead of Splenda; the muffins were definitely done in 20 minutes, not 25. I used paper liners, and this did not work out so well; the baked batter was glued to them. Next time I'll grease the muffin pan.

these muffins are great if you are diabetic, i make them just like the recipe calls for except i use all whole wheat flour and omit the topping part.and cook for only 15 minutes.  i make the recipe tripled and still cant keep them around here, my husband and son eat them up.They bring my sugar level down because of the cinamon in them. Its like getting to eat cake which i cant eat now being diabetic so its the next best thing.

These just came out of the oven and they are pretty tasty. I used half brown and half white sugar instead of splenda, They are a little on the sweet side. I only got 8 normal sized muffins out of this recipe.

These were so good!  I'm always looking for healthy/yummy snacks, and this is it!  I used regular applesauce instead of unsweetened, and cut the sugar back to just over 1/2 cup total, and used an extra splash of milk.  I also used whole wheat flour for the whole recipe.  I'm going to try freezing some and see how well they come back to life :-)

I used half brown sugar and half white sugar instead of sweeter.  Also, increased the amount of skim milk used to about 1/2 cup and utilized 2 eggs.

Very good! A touch bland though - add more cinnamon, sugar, and/or some vanilla.  Use aluminum baking cups - not paper. Be SURE to spray them down with some pam - these stick like crazy.

This was a pretty good recipe.  I changed it a little to make it more healthy for my son.  I used regular brown sugar instead of the sweetener, I added a dash more milk to thin out the batter, I added 3-4 tbsp. of ground flax to the muffins and the topping, and after the topping was put on the muffins I added a small sliver of cold butter on top to melt into the muffin while cooking. Next time I will use less apple, even though I used 2 small ones, it seemed to be a little too much, and I will add a little more apple sauce.  I made the mini muffins, and they cooked in about 14 minutes.

Good taste, healthy, satisfying but a bit rubbery. I might try adding a little oil or more apple sauce to the base component of these muffins.

I love these muffins!  So yummy I've made them twice in the past week.  I did use sugar instead of sucralose.

These are great! I grated one apple and chopped the other and that worked well. I also only needed to cook mine for 20 minutes. I added a little extra applesauce and a little extra milk (half skim, half whole) and used a 1/8 cup of regular white sugar and a 1/8 cup of brown sugar, which made the muffins sweet enough for us. Thanks for a delicious, healthy recipe, I will definitely make these again!

we really really liked these!! i went looking for a somewhat healthy muffin recipe that i could send in my teenage daughter's lunch, she's a bit picky and too much junk food. these are a hit. i like the kind of dense texture- dense in a good way- they have some body. the topping makes them. i did a few little spice changes and used real sugar. they were done in 20 minutes for me too.

Turned out really dry and a bit rubbery. Only alteration I made was adding the second egg to make it fluffier but this didn't work. I think I may have slightly overcooked them at 25 mins.

This was pretty tasty, but I think I will omit the topping next time as it just got all over th place and didn't really stay on the muffin.  I thought the batter seemed really dense when I was preparing it so I added a smidge more milk and a teaspoon of vanilla. They did stick to the muffin pan but, all in all, they tasted good.

This was an awesome recipe.  My husband was very leery when I was making them up.  He's not into healthy anything but he really enjoyed them.  We used a spray butter on top of them as soon as they came out of the oven.  Delicious!!!

These muffins are awesome.  I just got them out of the oven and they are definitely tasty!  I took the advice of another and added an egg.  I also thought the batter was a little dry and added some milk when mixing the apples in.  I think it would also be really good in mini loaf pans.  Great recipe!!  Thanks for sharing:)

I really enjoyed this recipe.  Healthy, easy to make, and very tasty.  The only thing I would do differently is to cut back on the topping as it makes too much.

These are very tasty - the only reason we gave it a rating of 4 stars is because it wasn't clear how much apple to put in the recipe - there is a big difference between two small apples and two large!!  (just for the record, we used one large and one medium).  We followed this recipe to the letter except we did add an extra egg as others suggested - and it's a good thing we did as the batter was barely moist enough even with the second egg added.  All in all though, they are a good and reasonably healthy alternative to your averate store-bought muffin.

These muffins weren't bad, but the consistency was a little strange. I recomend using a little less whole wheat flour and more white flour. The crispy topping was quite good, though, and I liked how they were healthy.

I love this recipe as do my kids. The first time I made it with the topping but it didn't go ove well with the kids.  The second time I left out the topping and they were just as delicious.  I also used regular suger instead. A definite keeper!

I followed the other's suggestions and added another egg, I had two pears that I needed to use up so I mashed those instead of the applesauce and used 1/2 c. of reg sugar rather than the splenda.  They turned out very well.  I think I would follow the other suggestions and add a little more milk as they were a little dry, but great for the nutrional value.  I would love to experiment with real maple syrup for the sweetner and cut out the sugar.  If any one tries this post it and let us know!

Pretty good for a super-healthy modified recipe.  Don't expect them to taste like regular high fat, all white flour muffins, though, because they don't.

Made these with my 13 year old daughter, for her breakfasts before school. Victory! She loves them! With the apples, applesauce, milk , egg and oats, she has a healthy, power packed treat better than anything she would voluntarily eat on busy school mornings!

I replaced the 3/4 cup of artificial sweetener with 1/2 cup pur cane sugar and 1/4 cup honey. I didn't realize I didn't have milk until the last minute, so I decided just the whole thing vegan, replacing the milk and eggs with half of a large banana, 1/4 cup water, and 1/2 cup applesauce. I skipped the whole topping and just sprinkled some cane sugar and cinnamon over it. And I only baked it eighteen minutes, and it was perfectly done. The flavors were great, and the vegan aspect altered the texture a bit but I won't count off for that (the original recipe didn't call for it). So basically, I altered the whole thing, and so this review isn't too reliable. But it was good anyway, and I found an **All Natural Vegan Substitute** for what it called for. Enjoy :)

This recipe doesn't make 12 regular sized muffins, infact just the opposite, I had enough to make 6 muffins. The temperature is a little too high, I cooked them at 375 so as not to burn the bottoms. I did not use a chemical sweetener but used raw sugar instead. They were OK, I've had better.

Muffins were pretty tasty however a bit on the drier side.  I did read other reviews so I didn't follow the recipe exactly.  I used 1 & 1/2 cups wheat flour and 1/2 cup of white flour added the whole 1/2 cup of applesauce to the batter with 1/2 cup of milk. I didn't do the topping instead I mixed chopped walnuts, cinnamon,  and sugar and sprinkled it over the top. My 3 year old and 18 month old liked the muffins which makes me happy!

I used a sugar/sweetener blend but kept the rest of the recipe the same. Turned out great! Nice breakfast with a cup of coffee and some yogurt on the side :)

I liked this recipe. Made a few modifications as noted by others to give it moisture.

We thought these were just alright.  The topping was strangly chewy and the flavor more on the bland side

I thought this was very good.  I gave it four stars because I made changes: 1/2 c. white flour and 1 c. white wheat flour; sugar (1/2 c.) instead of Splenda and oil instead of applesauce in the muffins; brown sugar instead of Splenda and melted butter instead of applesauce in the topping.  Also, I used cupcake liners and only baked the muffins for 20 minutes (which may have been 2 minutes too long).  As others have mentioned, the recipe makes twice as much topping as you need.  The muffins turned out light, moist, and delicious.

These muffins are outstanding!  My kids and I agreed that these deserve 5 stars.  I did not have a splenda so I did half brown and half white sugar and added a dash of apple pie spice but followed the rest of the recipe.  This made 18 muffins for me and the topping was the perfect amount.  Thanks for such a great recipe.
