Not your typical tuna salad! I halved the recipe only I used 2 full cans of tuna instead of one & a half. I did not have any fresh jalapenos so I used canned instead. I should have decreased the amount a bit to compensate as it had a little more heat than I thought it should have. But it still wasn't too hot for my grandson...he loved it! I did add some shredded mozzarella cheese to cut back on the heat some & it was a very tasty addition to the recipe.

This is a delicious tuna/pasta salad.  The lemon nicely compliments the seafood, and the jalepenos provide a suprise.  This is an interesting and welcomed bump-up for often-unexciting canned tuna!

Way to spicy and i LOVE spicy things. The lemon tang didn't seem to fit. I don't know... not the greatest.  No one liked it.

This is so, so, so good! Straight, easy and great tasting as it is. We all LOVED it. Looking forward to pimping it up with some of the suggestions, next time around. Thanks WebsByMegan!

I thought this was a fantastic recipe!  Used 12oz. of bow tie pasta and added some 1/2'd cherry tomatoes for color and went about the rest of the recipe exactly.  Home made mayo and fresh jalapenos were awesome!  Can't wait to take it to work tomorrow!!!  :)

Just made this. It's excellent. I didn't follow the measurements for the celery, jalapenos and onion exactly. I added more onion. Love it. Less celery. Hate it, but you can hardly tell it's in there. Hubby loves celery. And less jalapenos. I used two jalapenos. Was too scared it would turn out to spicy. Either those jalapenos weren't hot or it just needs more. Overall turned out really great. Can't wait to eat it for lunch tomorrow.

This makes a delicious lunch. I used white onion in place of the red and left the celery out. I will make this for lunch often.

Both my husband and I loved this fresh cold salad. I made it on a hot summer day and it hit the spot. The lemon zest gave a nice accent to the tuna salad. I did not add the sour cream as we were out and it was still delicious!

wonderful! I like the heat from jalapenos but don't enjoy the flavor so I used jarred peperoncinis instead and added a little of their juice to the mayo sauce. I also added diced cucumber and green apple to give it a little tartness and cool it down. Excellent, easy revival of a pasta salad---i will make this again.

I'm always looking for low fat pasta recipes and this one knocked it out of the park.  I doubled it and added the juice from one whole lemon.  Lovely and Easy!

Very good.  The whole family loved it and it was a much appreciated light dinner on a very hot night.  The changes I made were I only used 2 cans of tuna (all I had) and white onion instead of red and regular mustard instead of dijon.  Thanks for the recipe, I will be making this again.

I used 1 pouch of Starkist Thai chilli tuna & 2 cans of Bumblebee  solid white albacore.  I also used a couple of sprinkles of Slap yo mama seasoning in place of salt & pepper. I susubstituted jalapenos for the original Chicago mild giardiniera mix. My family Loves this spicy tuna pasta salad with freshly shredded parmesan cheese. Yummmmmy!

This is my 2nd most favorite recipe on allrecipes.  I have made it dozens of times.  I just add a little more jalapeno and red onion and a tadge bit more of the mayo, sour cream, etc., to make it moister, also can substitute yogurt for the mayo.  It is great.

I made it without the pasta and served it with crackers and whole grain tortilla chips.  Huge hit with everyone!
