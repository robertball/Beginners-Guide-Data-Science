Nice, only change was to use blueberries instead of bananas.  It is pretty too.

This was easy and just enough of a difference to your standard jello with fruit that it really stood out and got rave reviews. By no means a gourmet or exotic side or dessert, but a tasty, easy, and economical salad that is definitely worth trying. Instead of whipped topping I made whipped cream (fresh whipped cream is so easy and much better flavor, texture, and richness compared to whipped topping in a tub. My personal opinion). Seved it with a ham dinner and the sweetness was perfect compliment to the salty ham.

Delicious, easy, and you can be a little flexible with the fruits you add and flavor of jello you.  It's true - the secret is that yummy frosting!

Instead of bananas I used a can of cherry pie filling. The combo of cherries and jello and pineapples was delicious.The frosting on top was definitely the secret. This recipe is going to my recipe box!:)

No different that jello with fruit in it. Topping ok. Just not special.

Nice taste,and reminds me of all the jello dishes family,friends made during holidays and family gatherings.I used sugarfree cherry jello,for people on a strict diabetic diet. Used no flour either, I made this dish gluten free by the substitution of Xanthan gum. Mom's Secret Cherry jello was light and refreshing!

I was expecting the topping to be more firm.  It was kind of a mushy mixture and there was way too much of it.  Just didn't really care for it.
