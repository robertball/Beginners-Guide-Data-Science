I haven't made thsi recipe, but I am an Indian and both my husband and I loovveee Biryani and cook often. If you want to know the secret to fast biryani cooking, go to any Indian/Pakistani grocery store and buy "Shan" spice mix for it, its so easy adn really good. I can't say the best, but its so much easier than doing everything that Biryani recipe makes you do.

While this recipe is time consuming, it is well worth it! I made a couple changes, I added cashews and raisins when adding the chicken broth, and I used chicken wings and drumsticks with the bone-in instead of cutting up the whole chicken.  This is easier, and I wanted to avoid dry pieces of chicken in other biryani dishes that I have had.  The chicken came out extremely tender, it was falling off the bone.  Absolutely delicious!  The flavor is mild for the Indian palatte, so if you like it spicy add more spice, but overall this recipe is a definite keeper.  This would be a great dish to make for a lot of people as the quantity is large.  Also be sure to use basmati rice with this it is so aromatic and delicious.

This really isn't the best biryani recipe I've made, but it's fast for biryani so I thought I'd give it a shot.

I had to double all the curry spices and added a good helping of garam marsala.  I never even tasted a hint of mint so I'm thinking that doubling the mint might help as well.

When you're cooking your rice, I would eliminate the onions and let the spices sit in the oil until it's nice and fragrant.  Then add the rice and cook for five minutes to let the rice absorb some of the flavors.  Once you've added it to the rest of the recipe don't cook on the lowest temp or it will get soggy.  You need to cook basmati rice on a med-low heat and much faster to avoid soggy rice.

This recipe is HUGE.  I cut it down to four servings and still had too much food.

My Brother-in-law is from Pakistan and I love their food so I was looking for recipes to fix for my family.  I found this one and my husband has added it to his favorites catagory.  I even fixed it for my mother-in-law and she loved it too.  Hint on how to make it not take so long...measure out all of your spices and ingredients prior to cooking.  Do all of your chopping of the onions and all first and it will go a lot faster.  I have fixed this many times now and we love it.  Today I am going to substitute beef for the chicken and see how it turns out.

Chicken Biryani is one of the more complicated rice dishes in Indian/pakistani cooking. Being quite an amateur cook, I still managed to cook up a feast with this single dish and my hubby is still licking his fingers! I am never looking for another biryani recipe after this . Thanks Nazia- Radhika & Jai

Wow!!  This was amazing.  I made it for a bunch of friends and made very few modifications.  I used boneless skinless drumsticks which I beleive were the perfect choice for this dish as they had enough dark meat to stay plenty moist.  The only change I amde was to add raisins and cashews during the rice cooking stage but that was only due to personal preference.  I didn't find the recipe particularly time consuming.  I started making it 2 hours prior to the time I wanted to serve it and it was ready right on time, during the 2 long cooking stages there isn't anything to do except set the table, pour some wine and enjoy the delicious smells.

My husband is from southern India and this is one of his favorite dishes.  This recipe is made in different ways, the Muslim version (according to him), being the best, and most difficult.  I made this recipe for my husband; however, I think it's important you chop up 3 small green chiles and cook it with the tomato mixture, that way, it gives this dish the necessary kick as in India.  Also, my husband said the original version is made with hard boiled eggs and not potatoes, though I made it with potatoes.  Finally, along with the green chiles and tomato mixture, I also added about 2 tablespoons of red pepper flakes.    Overall, this recipe is good and my husband said it tasted EXACTLY like the way his mother made it back in India.

My husband is from Sind province, Pakistan.  I've been cooking Pakistani/Indian dishes for 25 years.  I thought I'd try this recipe. My family liked it, but not as much as the authentic style I usually make. This is more like a plou not biryani. I will make this again with a few variations. Instead of frying more onions while cooking the rice. I will add the spices and let them fry until fragrant then add the rice and the chicken stock. ( to tell you the truth, I will probably use water not stock) I will cook the rice until half done.  Then in a new pot I will scoop 1/3 of the chicken mixture on the bottom. Add some fresh mint leaves and some fresh tomatoes slices on top. Then put 1/3 of the half-boiled rice on top. I will layer two more times ending with the rice on top.  As someone noted you really need to cook the rice on medium heat or it will be soggy.  That is why it is best to cook the rice separately half way then layer. At the end, when there is no more liquid left  you can cover it with a couple paper towels or a cloth and then put the lid on top.  That is when you simmer it on low temperature for 20 mins. That helps to remove more moisture and the rice will come out perfect!

Five stars if the spices were doubled and half were used to pre-season the chicken.  I cooked the chicken on it's own, then added to the mixture.

I've never tasted indian food before, even if I came from it's neighbouring country, so I decided to give this a try. I didn't wanted it to be too dry, so I doubled the amount of yoghurt (actually I think I dumped in 1/2 cups of yoghurt, while I reduced the meat to using only 2 chicken breast-halves). After tasting the gravy, I added crushed corriander, sugar, and garam masala but that was my own preference. The end result was delicious!! I served it over nasi kuning, which is an Indonesian yellow rice dish. Giving it 4 stars because I didn't follow the recipe exactly.

I'm a little confused, It says 2 large onions, finely chopped & then 1 large onion, diced again? Is it a combination? Is it meant to combined?

We love indian food, and found this recipe as a good starter.  I have made it 2 or 3 times and have compared it with other biryani recipes I have found.  

I think if I had a biryani spice mix maybe that would kick it up a notch, but as it is, I would increase the cumin, ginger, and garlic as well as the clove.  

Other biryani's I have had have included cauliflower, carrots, peas, raisins and cashews and I include them in lieu of the potatoes.  Since there is already rice, I don't see the need for another starch.  I would also use ghee rather than oil. And last, I would use 3 or 4 tomatoes instead of only 2.  I would look for a solution to the problem I had of cooking the rice, on a low setting, the rice at the top was crunchy and the rice at the bottom was soggy.  Also, i like some heat in my indian food and this is completely without any spiciness to speak of...I would put a tsp of garam masala to give it some of the hot spice I anticipate when I eat indian food.

This recipe is awesome! The best biryani recipe ever! I skipped the potatoes since it dint work well for me before. After reading a few reviews, I decided to add more spice. I added 1 tsp of chilli powder, 1 tsp of ground pepper instead of half tsp each. This is the first time that I have succeeded in making a good biryani! Thank you so much!

This recipe is just like what I eat in restaurants! I am Egyptian but I love Biryani and yesterday I decided to cook it to my fiance and he just lovced it. Initially I thought he might be saying he loved it to flatter me. But eating more than one third of the whole dish proved me wrong.  I took the advice on one of the reviews on this recipe to prepare all ingredients in advance.  One tip, when you cook the chicken, do not start cooking the rice immeditely. You have to wait for may be 30 minutes then start with the rice. That is because you will have to add the chicken (which is supposed to be already cooked) to the rice when you are cooking it! So unless the chicken is cooked or at least you have maximum 10 minutes to go, do not start with cooking the rice.
Thanks for the person who wrote the recipe.

It was really good, but not quite up to expectations.  It could be my fault...I didn't have cardamom pods, so I substituted 1/2 tsp ground cardamom per pod for it.  The whole dish was overly redolent of cardamom.  I was expecting something more balanced, so next time (and there will be a next time), I'll give the pods a try as the recipe calls for.  Finally, I didn't add the salt into the rice portion of the dish, figuring the salt in my Swanson's chicken broth would be enough.  It wasn't.  Next time I'll trust the recipe more.  Absolutely worth a try, just be aware that you may need to be more literal about this recipe than some other ones on the site.

I'm used to cooking an authentic lamb biryani a completely different way.  I even tossed up whether to adapt my version to this one, but I'm so glad I didn't!!  This recipe is sensational!!!  I followed the directions exactly (except I used a bit less salt!) and apart from the accompanying picture being incorrect, it turned out perfectly!!  Great flavours, succulent tender chicken!!  Can't wait for leftovers tomorrow night!!

This was incredibly good.  The cover picture is misleading though.  The rice is cooked together WITH the chicken.  Had to read the recipe a couple times to get that.  The flavors were stunning.  Best Indian I've ever made.  Will definitely make it again.  YUM

Very delicious and simple recipe for biryani! I did increase the amount of garlic, ginger, and chili powder and instead of stock I used water. Usually making biryani can be so laborious if you layer up the rice and chicken, but this recipe was easier and soaked up the spices and seasoning very well. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this as a covered dish for our foreign exchange student's orientation.  It was a huge hit.  My son, who is a picky eater, told me the recipe was a keeper!  I did not have cardamomor powdered saffron.  I used a biryani spice mix, omitting the spices included in the mix. I also used saffron threads, which probably would have made the rice a beautiful yellow had I known how to use it properly.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful dish!

This was pretty good.  I think I messed up in chopping the onions too finely as the mixture was quite liquid-y.  And I think cooking the rice on the lowest setting on my stove was too low as it ended up being mushy as well.  But texture aside, the flavors were mild, but very nice.  I would season the potatoes & chicken a bit next time, or dice them a bit smaller, as they were a bit bland.

I am Bengali and love biryani. I doubled the spices to the curry portion and added raisins and cashews after i poured in the chicken stock. Very good and easy to make if you have all your ingredients and pots/pans laid out.

Very complex instructions, and the end result was not as desirable as one might have thought from the smells. I think the Turmeric gave it a 'dusty' taste - my younger brother (age 16) said "why'd you put dirt in this?" - I would recommend the rice part of this dish, it's fabulous, but skip the lengthy process on the chicken, it's too complex, and doesn't taste nearly as good as it smells.

I followed this chicken biryani recipe closely, but it didn't turn out well at all. It was really bland. Which is shocking, because it smelled amazing. After 3 hours of prep/cooking, I was quite let down by the way this turned out.

Of all the Biryani recipes that I've tried so far, this one is my top favorite. I hardly made any changes to it and it turned out super delicious....love it. the cooking time is not as long as it seems, the only time consuming part is cooking the chicken. I'm definitely going to make it over and over again.....

Love Love Love :) Biryani has always intimidated me, but this was delicious. The hubbs agreed, as evident by his desire for second helpings. He couldn't stop raving about it.

my first try and it turned out much better than I expected, however, I have to say it turned out way toooo salty. Next time I won't use any salt and only half chicken stock and half water or maybe just the salt and all water and no chick stock at all, other than that it was perfect Tastey and spicy!

This was great; the cardamom offers a delicious and different flavor.   The only change I made is using water rather than broth to cook the rice in; with all the spices it seems unneccessary and wasteful to use broth.  I'll definitely make biryani again.

Didn't really taste like the biryani in the Indian restaurants here in the Detroit area, but it was flavorful and did taste "Indian".  We added raisins and nuts, which gave it a nice twist.  This was a chore (almost 4 hours!), so make sure you have plenty of time.

I spent about 3 hours preparing everything.  It smelled absolutely fabulous but the taste was a real let-down.  It didn't get any better the next day either.  Perhaps another shot before giving up.

If my rating was just for taste, this would get 5 stars.  Although it's not a quick recipe, it's not difficult (just follow the directions). The result it an absolutely superb one-in-one-pot meal that is well worth the effort and time.

This is by far the absolute best byrianni recipe I ever tasted and the only recipe that has worked for me. I normally hate byrianni but this is one recipe that even I couldn't resist. My husband was really excited when he peeked inside the pan to see what was for dinner and he ended up eating too much :)~ This recipe really saved the day! For the best tasting results I always use Cornish Hens (the little chilckens) as they always seem to cook the best and have the best flavour. You may want to cut up and use two of the little chilkens but I gurantee they give a much more pleasant taste and appearance to the dish than the larger chickens.

I didnt like the taste of this at all. Too salty, and something wierd that I cant put my finger on. Also, very little flavor for the amount of rice and meat. The biryanis I grew up with in South Africa make this one a complete non-contender. It tastes like a bland stew to me, and not at all like biryani.

I used the recipe for the chicken but not the rice since I used a rice cooker.  I also used chicken thighs instead of breasts because it's what I had.  I did use all the spices and this was very tasty!.. :)

great recipe!  it was a little too mild for me, and considering i'm pretty sensitive to hotness.. i'd add some more chili powder  i also added peas, carrots, and red bell peppers which i thought was a great touch. (the bell peppers especially gave it a refreshing crunchiness)

I enjoyed this recipe - it was easy to make, prepared quickly, and is tasty.  Next time, I will pre-wash my rice to avoid some of the pastiness.

I used ingredients that I had on-hand which included:
Boneless, skinless chicken thighs - I'd recommend thighs over breast, or bone-in pieces (even though most authentic Biryani seems to contain bone-in chicken).
Ground cinnamon - since I had no sticks available, using ground cinn. did not detract in any way.
Dried mint flakes instead of fresh - again, using dried mint had no negative effect.
Ground ginger - no problem with this substitution.
Sour cream instead of yogurt - another harmless substitution.
I had no cardamom...it would have been nice, but it was fine without.
Preparation - I prepped the potatoes as directed, then prepped the rice and chicken separately.  I combined the chicken, potatoes, and rice at the very end to speed the process and keep the potatoes from getting too mushy.

This was not exactly like the Biryani that I eat in restaurants, but was every bit as good in its own right.

I don't have a problem with recipes that have several steps and/or require a lot of prep time, as long as the results are worth it. This wasn't worth it, imo. I ended up adding a lot more spices and yogurt, and most of a can of tomatoes. The end result wasn't terrible, but it was quite a lot of work for rather mediocre results. Thanks anyway!

Very good; really reflects the complex interplay of spices and flavors
that is biryani.  But I can't give it five stars because, while not a
difficult recipe, it is very time consuming: it took me 2.5 hours from
beginning chopping to putting it on the table.  (I imagine I'll be faster
next time, but it's probably still nearly two hours in raw cooking time.
I'm trying to think of ways to do this faster.  If I come up with
something significant I'll try to remember to update this review.)

I have made this recipe about 5 times now and it is a very good base.  I have made some changes, just as it seems others who have rated this recipe have done.  I wanted to make it taste more like the biryiani that my favorite Indian restaurant makes.  It is not very hot spicy at all so I added about 2 tsp cayenne pepper and a chopped jalapeño when I sauted the onion.  I also increased the amount of all the spices, about double the amount works in my opinion.  I did not have cardamom pods so I used 3/4 tsp ground cardamom instead and I also used saffron threads instead.  I added about a cup each of broccoli, cauliflower, carrots and string beans, all cut up into appropriate sizes and sauted in vegetable oil.  Those were added into the rice with the potatoes.  I also threw in golden raisins and cashews.  When all these changes were made, my family thought the biryiani was just right!

not flavourful enough. It was good, but not an Indian dish I was expecting. 
It makes tons of food, next time I will use less rice and chicken but the same amount of spices.

Great recipe.  This was my first attempt at Indian cuisine and it was delicious.  It takes some time to prepare but the results are worth it.  I substituted olive oil for the vegetable oil and white rice for the basmati rice, but otherwise I followed the recipe as-is.  My kids, who are both picky eaters, loved it.

One mistake I made was using canned tomatoes--I added the entire contents of the can instead of draining the tomatoes first.  This added excessive fluid to the gravy mixture resulting in longer cooking times before it would thicken.  Next time I will drain and add the liquid only as needed.

I bought fresh mint per the recipe and I'm glad I did--you can taste it in the baked dish and I think it really helps bring out the flavor.

Lovely Biryani.  Used to eat this a lot at work many years ago when I was working for Indian people.  Always wanted to try it for myself, so I tried this recipe.  Only negative was that my potatoes was not cooked.  Next time I'll add them while the sauce reduces.  I'd rather have them overcooked, than not properly cooked.

This was the first biryani recipe that I tried and have been cooking it for about a year now whenever I'm craving some Indian food.  I bought packaged spice mixes from my trip to India a two years ago and use the one labeled Madras curry and potato masala instead of measuring every single spice out, but I still add in the cinnamon sticks and whole cloves and it tastes great.  I also add some more vegetables: carrots, peas and more potatoes, then it's a hearty main dish!

It was great! Though I did need some added zing - maybe some Paprika? I felt it needed to be much spicier, but the flavor overall was great, and most of my friends who enjoyed this dish are not into spicy foods - so just perfect! I did not have yogurt on hand - used sour cream instead and it tasted just fine. Curious to know what the difference in taste might have been. Definitely making again in the very near future! Served w/Basmati rice & I also sprinkled lots of the Pampered Chef Moroccan Rub on top! MMM!

Fantastic!  Wouldn't change a thing.  We didn't have Saffron so we used Saffron rice mixed with Basmati rice.  We have a top notch Indian food restaurant close by that this recipe rivals, if not exceeds.  It's a keeper.

This was really good and yeah a little more work then I usually do for dinner. I added a little more of all spice and added marsala too. I added the spuds back with the chicken to cook them thru. Used ground cloves and no salt  and used canned tomato, every thing else the same. The Authentic Biryani on this site is good too, by su. Would make again.

I do not know when was the last time I made Indian food from scratch so as I was making this I did not know if it was going well or not. However, in the end it was delicious. It does take time to make but if you have preparations made in advance, it is not so bad and is well worth it. Thank you for this delicious recipe. Please send more.

I found this recipe to be tasty but I agree with some of the other reviewers- a lot of time and energy required for this recipe! I also found that my chicken went rather dry. The amount of food it made was also huge!! I could have fed a family of 10 on this amount. Additionally, it did not keep very well as the leftovers were  quite dry the next day. But to be fair, the flavour was very nice when fresh from the pan.

The cardomam overwhelmed the other ingredients, so next time I'll bump up the other spices and reduce that a touch.  Nevertheless, it was GREAT and days later my ravenous horde of friends is still raving. Also, I recommend adding pistachios or cashews for a nice compliment to the spices and make sure you have a food processor or some kind of chopper or you'll lose your mind.

I liked it, but a lot of work! And Also if you like it spicy, add spices or chilies because it was rather bland. The rice came out looking great though!

The dish was quite good, but I'm not sure if the outcome warranted the amount of work put into it. I don't think I'll be making this often simply because I don't have the time to, but I'll probably try it again on special occasions.

This recipe is excellent. My husband is English and loves Pakistani/Indian food and for years I have experimented and nothing has come out this good. It's not a quick recipe but worth it, make sure you don't leave out any ingredients! Its good for the kids too, not too spicy. I loved it.

This is not a biryani, it is actually a pulao. In a biryani, the meat is cooked at the bottom of the pot and the rice, butter and spiced are layered on top of it.

However, this recipe is delicious and takes way less time than a biryani! I always make this recipe a little more traditional by topping the finished dish with chopped mint and coriander, and drizzling it with melted clarified butter (ghee) and a little rose water. This really makes a difference!

I haven't tried the exact recipe - but the technique REALLY helped me with my own biryani/curry/paella creation. Thanks!

I was somewhat disappointed by this recipe after putting in about 2 hours of preparation. The potatoes were not completely cooked (had to pick them out and microwave them for a minute or two), the chicken didn't absorb any flavor and was very dry, and some of the rice wasn't cooked all the way either. I was disappointed by how bland it was in spite of all the spices used. It was all around okay but I probably wouldn't make it again.

Delicious.  I did add some chicken broth to the mix though since I used vanilla yogurt; had to balance the flavours.  So good, especially with Indian Saffron Rice from this site and steamed broccoli.

Indian restaurants are few and far between, hence I tried to make one at home. After endless search and trials, this one is perfect for me and my husband (we both worked in the Middle Eastern region at one time). Time consuming but really worth it in the end.

I'm only giving 4 stars because I think potatos in Biryani is wierd (I left them out). With that adjustment, plus extra mint, and a biryani spice mix instead of the powders, it was EXCELLENT. But this is all according to taste, so do whatever you want to adjust to yours and it will be a 5 star meal. I think next time I will use ground spices in the rice rather than the whole (even if it is more authentic, I don't like to bite down on a whole cardamom or clove, and I don't think the flavors got to the rest of the rice as powedered spices would).

This was great! The version of biryani (there are many) that I'm familiar with doesn't have potatoes, so I left that ingredient out. Also, the ghee made all the difference!

While the spice combination is delightful, I had some difficulty in getting the rice to cook properly. The resulting dish was thus less than it could have been, disappointing considering the various steps involved. I shall try it again, perhaps with better luck-- the flavour really is very nice.

20 minutes for potatoes to cook under steam is insufficient so naturally they came out practically raw! I followed this recipe to a tee but it tasted completely bland, undercooked potatoes, over cooked rice and both me and my boyfriend hated it. Only reason I decided to follow this recipe was because I was out of the Shaan biryani mix. 

If I try this the next time I’m going down on the amount of chicken, adding the potatoes in earlier and definitely at least doubling up on the salt and chili powder so it doesn’t taste like a bland mashed up dish

Nothing special. Also the potatoes weren't done by the time the rice was. As you can imagine, this is quite a big issue.  Not worth the time.

I don't know much about the authenticity of this dish but it was good! I followed the suggestions of a couple reviewers, I doubled the spices (will triple all next time except the tumeric) and I could not find cardamom at my grocery store so I left it out. Not sure if I missed it not being in there because I don't recall what it tastes like. I also used chicken legs and they turned out great. Next time I will add raisins. All in all a good recipe just need more spice to it so double them for sure. I think this would've been pretty bland if you don't at least double them.

Also, this isn't all that time consuming to make this if you have things ready to go and multi task a bit. I would say it took me between and hour and an hour and a half to make.

I have made this recipe a few times now, and have made a couple alterations that I enjoy and kicks the flavor up a notch.

I purchased a packaged Biryani kit, Kitchens of India Hyderabadi Biryani Paste.  It includes a package of spices that are harder to find in my area, so that helps.

I used the paste in the kit and mixed it with a half cup of plain yogurt a day ahead.  I then put whole drumsticks and thighs into the curried yogurt and marinate overnight.  

I skipped the potatoes, and added soaked raisins during the last step. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly, and was able to use the spices that came with the kit and supplement with my own.  I did find that marinating the chicken with the yogurt does result in more gravy, but that's just fine with me!

While this recipe says to wash the rice and drain in the colander for half an hour, I would recommend soaking it first, then draining.  Before making this recipe I rinse the rise thoroughly, then put it into a bowl and cover with water, letting it soak for 5 minutes or so, then into the colander and let it dry for the remainder of the time you are making this recipe, which should be an hour or so.  This should give you a very  nice, non-stick, fluffy rice.

To punch up the presentation, when this meal is done, scoop about 3/4 of a cup of the finished rice mixture into one bowl, and another 3/4 cup into a second bowl.  In bowl one, add about a half teaspoon or so of Tumeric and mix thoroughly to get a rich orang

I have made this recipe two times.  The second time I doubled the spices as others suggested and it was much better.  I also added small carrots and zucchini in the last step and garnished with cilantro.  :)

It turned out wonderful.  I did not have any mint and I used powdered ginger and cinnamon and cloves but all was great in the end.

Impressed the hell out of my girlfriend when I made this. We both travel to India for business so we know good Biryani. Although, I'm not a master chef, this turned out really well!!

This came out great.  A little labor intensive, but worth it.
