The ingredients are way too much to fit in a crockpot. I used half the water and was right to top of crockpot. Cooked on high for about 5 hrs then tranferred to stock pot on top of stove to add cabbage and rest of watsr. Flavor a bit bland, needs something else. If I make it again, I'll do 1/2 the recipe and make some other changes.

You have to use a large slow cooker for this recipe, not a crockpot.  You also have to cook it on high, not low.  It's an ALL DAY cook (10 hours or more), not a 4 hour cook.  Another suggestion would be to soak the lentils overnight to speed up the cooking process. I added a bay leaf and substituted the can of diced tomatoes for a can of mild Rotel tomatoes with green chilies to kick it up a notch.  I also changed the meat to pickled pork (or you could use cubed ham or diced salt pork), which you can just put right into the slow cooker and skip the first step. I used all broth rather than water for added flavor and I happened to have that much broth on hand. I also put the cabbage into the slow cooker right from the beginning or you can omit it altogether.  With my changes, I'd give it a 5, but as is, it's only a 3 at best. Sorry.

After three hours in the Crockpot on HIGH, the lentils were still hard.  Removed the soup to finish cooking on top of the stove.  This recipe is way off! The lentils soaked up too much of the broth! Suggest using half (8 oz) of lentils and Italian sausage for more flavor.

Flavor with spices was good. I used a pound of Ital sausage, one can of tomato sauce and one can of diced tomatoes.. I also added 1 cup of acini de peppe pasta at the end to add some bulk.    My husband called it a "keeper"!

Delicious!!  I did it on the stove top rather than crock pot. Made a few changes (to fit what I had on hand): used 1 can stewed tomatoes instead of diced, used quartered fresh Brussels sprouts instead of cabbage (yum!!... adds sweetness), and added some baby Bella mushrooms and frozen corn kernels.  5 stars!!!!!

This is definitely a keeper!  The only change I made was to swap out some of the water for more broth and to add some hot sauce for a small kick. My lentils were very tender- I had soaked the dry lentils in water overnight.  We really enjoyed this soup on a rainy day!

I liked the basic concept of this recipe! We loved the outcome; but I altered it! I read through all of the comments first! Been finding major benefits that way:)  I started with homemade broth from a-previous boiled pork recipe!  Made 2/3 qty! Only used 1 -16oz can Goya prepared lentils; use 3 if you like lentilsI ialso fried/crisp on outsidequarter size brat sausage b isausage! My seasons were in the broth also it had carrot, celery, onion pieces already! Put in 4  quart crockpot and cooked 8 hrs on low!  FYI Lentils dry are cooked same process as navy beans! My 1970's era Crockpot book by Rival states to stove to precook beans for 1/2 hour, use the cooked water for a stock starter; so I freeze mine. Alternatively soak beans overnight in cold water normally 4 to 1 ratio water to beans! I fill my pan 4 inches above the dry beans generally! Also be sure to check the instructions on the bean bag itself! You can learn a lot new to cooking people! I'm new to this app; been cooking for 40+ yrs! My family is enjoying the NEW menu items

This is a really nice soup.  There is a nice mix of textures, and the broth is not too thick.  I did not add garlic powder, used about 3/4 lb. of sausage, and put in a cup of red wine as part of the liquid.  I put in chopped Kale as opposed to cabbage.  Will definitely make again.  Warning, this makes a lot of soup!

I found this bland! I had to add salt, Tony's, and some hot sauce. I agree with the other changes that I've read on the reviews. It needs twice the sausage and use all chicken broth instead of water. And it definitely needs way more seasoning for this Louisiana girl!

After 4.5 hours on low, the lentils were quite crunchy.  I put enough for dinner in a large pot on the stove and boiled it for 30-40 minutes, while turning the crock pot to high.  We had part of the stove top soup for dinner.  It was edible but bland.  That was when I realized I had forgotten to put all of the herbs, spices, salt, and pepper in it.  I threw all leftovers back in the crock pot and let it continue to cook on high during the evening.  I just tasted it and it is delicious.  We have agreed to have it again for dinner tomorrow.  The cooking time definitely needs to be adjusted, but the soup is hearty and tasty.

I followed this recipe exactly but substituted kielbasa for the sausage.  I did simmer the lentils fro about 30 minutes in chicken broth before combining everything in the crock pot.  It got rave reviews from everyone.  I just had a bowl of leftover soup for lunch and it is even better the next day.  Great recipe for a hearty soup!

My crockpot was definitely too small also!  But what a delicious recipe.  Since I always have homemade chicken or vegetable broth I used that instead of water.  I never even got to the cabbage at the end, even great without it.  And indeed I fed the two of us; took a big batch to son and daughter in law (with new baby); and several servings to elderly neighbor.

This was a great meal. I did incorporate many of the suggestions made by previous reviews, such as reducing the lentils by 1/2, omitting the water and use 2 32oz chicken broth, adding chill powder and balsamic vinegar. As well, I added the cabbage at the beginning and set the slow cooker on high for 7 hours. Everything was perfect and it had a really nice zip!

After 7 hours in a large crock pot the lentils were still hard and I wasn't sure what kind of bulk sausage to use so I tried breakfast sausage.  I think I should have used Italian sausage.  It is sort of bland - tastes like it is missing something.  I would not use as much garlic powder if I decide to make this again since after eating the soup all I can taste is garlic..

This is absolutely delicious. I made it in my 7-quart crock pot, which was all the way full with the recipe exactly as it is written. I did cook it on high all day, and the lentils were nicely tender and fall-apart. All three of my kids (elementary and middle school) are wild about it. It is such a fantastic choice for our diabetic child too - plenty of fiber and protein to help him stay steady.  We will make this again and again!!!

I actually ended up really liking this soup, but I made several changes:
1) Did not use any water.  Instead, used two 32-oz boxes of chicken broth.
2) Used half of a 16 oz package of lentils
3) Used a 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes
4) Added 1 tbsp chili powder
5) Added 1 tsp garlic chili paste
5) Added 1/2 cup of balsamic vinegar.

Followed the rest of the recipe the same.  Agree that there's no way the lentils will be done in 4 hrs. Next time I'll probably cook the lentils in a pot before adding to the crock pot.

This recipe was great, however I did not use a crock pot. I followed the recipe exactly and my only substitution was that I used chicken sausage (& doubled the amount). It took about an hour on the stove in a large soup pot. Loved the soup! Only reason I didn't give it 5? was bc I didn't t use the crock pot

Has been in the crockpot for over 4 1/2 hours and the lentils are still not done. Liquid is way too much for my crockpot, filled it right up to the top. Should have read other reviews before I made this soup, mistake on my part.

3.5 stars on this.  First off, I adjusted the servings to 4 so that made a big difference; we had plenty for dinner and a night of leftover.  Overall it was not bad; but it took longer than 4 hours; I cooked it on low about 5.  I made a few other changes:  I used sweet italian turkey sausage.  Used 1 tsp minced garlic, 1 tsp garlic powder, a bit more fresh parsley and fresh rosemary and napa cabbage.  Should have added more salt but that is easily added at the table.  My daughter loved it and the husband liked it alot too. For me it was missing something.  I added fresh parsley and shredded parmesan cheese on top when serving.

This soup was good.  I used Aidells chicken apple sausage because I'm trying to follow a specific diet that doesn't allow regular pork sausage.  Had I used to pork sausage it may have been a little more flavorful.  However, If I make it again I will probably use a little less water and less lentils.  A 16 oz bag is a LOT of lentils.  I would also add more sausage.  Overall a good soup.

Mine came out more like stew than soup and I'm not sure why.  I followed the recipe exactly.  None the less, I am happy with the consistency.  Finished product was a bit bland for us but was improved with additions of liquid smoke, garlic, salt, pepper.
