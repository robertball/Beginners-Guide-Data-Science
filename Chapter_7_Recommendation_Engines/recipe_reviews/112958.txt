I'd just like to say that we normally don't eat squirrels in Belgium. Rabbit, pheasant, maybe even pigeon, but I never ate squirrel in my life. The recipe looks fine as it is, but I would substitute the water with a nice dark Belgian beer. Greetings from Belgium

Great recipe. You can also substitute rabbit for squirrel. I add a little red wine as well.

I had eaten squirrel before, but not for years. This dish was fabulous! Thank you so much for submitting it. It's one we will make again and again. I want to try it with some red wine, like one reviewer did; see which way I like it best. Thanks again!

I never ate squirrel before and was leary. . .This is a very good recipe.  I would double up on the flour though

I did not have dried prunes so I worked with what I had which was dried medjool dates. I used fresh thyme and only had 1 squirrel so I cut everything by 1/3 with the exception of still using 18 dates which I forgot to reduce to 6. I added a bit of black pepper as well. This was the first time I have ever cooked or eaten squirrel and I thought the recipe was phenomenal! I will definitely try this with rabbit as well. I would be interested in trying it with the wine substitution but I thought it tasted excellent as is.  I think my mistake of not reducing the dried fruit added a hint of sweet to the gravy and I love the fresh thyme along with that slight sweetness. I will definitely make this again if I have a squirrel to cook up. I think this would be excellent served with a jasmine date rice for a side, or garlic mashed potatoes, along with roasted parsnips, carrots and beets.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Turned out great.  I was cooking for 6 people so I adjusted the amount up for 9 squirrels and added large 3 sliced apples.  Kept everything else the same.  The timing on it is just right for everything to be tender.
