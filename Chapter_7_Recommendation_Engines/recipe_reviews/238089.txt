This was not good. Don't know why, as I like al the ingredients. Maybe the plant-based protein powder or frozen pineapple vs. fresh. There was this funky background taste I couldn't cover up.  Tried adding more things to fix it, but no-go.

This tastes like a cocktail. I used 2 dates instead of agave and protein powder. Thank you for the recipe.

There's no need for a sweetener in this recipe, a ripe (frozen) banana and pineapple are sweet enough on their own, also not required if you use coconut milk that has been sweetened as well. Plain or vanilla Greek yogurt can also replace the protein powder, and (raw shelled) hemp seeds can replace the flax seeds.
