I made this recipe using a homemade alfredo sauce (instead of jar). It was less rich and a nice change to your typical fettucini alfredo. I also seared a chicken breast in a wrought iron skillet instead of using 'ready to eat' type strips. It was still very easy to make and the red pepper taste was good. I will agree, though, that the recipe was still slightly bland. Needs some type of kick, but I'm not sure what.

This was quick and easy to prepare....Perfect after being at soccer fields all night. However, it was still a bit bland.
