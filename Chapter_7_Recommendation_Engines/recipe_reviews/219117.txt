Yumm! I made this the other evening and it is awesome. However I did Tweek some. I added 2 cans of Cannellini (white Pinto Bean) 1/2 white onion, 1 can petite diced tomatoes and let cook for atleast hour and the longer the better. My husband added shredded cheese to his. It is Very Good. I also have friends that add 4 cans beans and put ontop of tortilla chips and they say it is Very Good.  You Will Enjoy this 100%

I have been making this for about 4 years now.  2-3 times a month during the winter!  I use extra virgin olive oil instead of veg. oil, and I also fry 1 small-med diced onion with the chicken.  I also use chicken broth instead of oil, and 2 cans of beans.  This is a staple comfort food in our house!

We love this recipe. It's simple to make & tastes great! I always season my chicken with garlic, onion, & black pepper when cooking it. I add 2 cans of beans instead of 1 though & sometimes add 1/2 cup of frozen corn to it. We like to top it with shredded cheese & sour cream. Great with baked or fried cornbread too!!

I Love this stuff, just FYI if you are camping, you can bring a large can of chicken and add instead of cooking it- perfect.

Really good!  I added an onion, garlic, one 11 ounce can of corn and another can of white beans.  I also added some dried cilantro.  I substituted low-sodium chicken broth for water and increased by another cup.  Next time I will do half water and half broth, cause it was still a little salty.  I think the corn really kicked it up another notch.  Will definitely make this again!

I think if you add a bit of cheddar cheese on top it adds to the taste of the chili

I thought this was soooo good.  I purchased all the ingredients (even the White Chili Seasoning).  When I opened the seasoning packet, I just didn't like what was in the powder mix.  Lol, I am sooo picky with my food (even though I should've paid attention to the picture on the packet lol).  I was trying to pick out some of the big pieces but was an epic fail lol so I barely used the packet.  I just added some chili and garlic powder.  I decided to serve it over white rice and added cheddar cheese and sour cream on top and it was soooooooooooo delicious.  Definitely will make again and maybe add some corn. Oh and I used two cans of white beans (undrained) and two cups of water

I have been making this recipe for years.  It is quick and delicious.  I also add a bag of frozen vegetables (your choice) to make the chili go a little further.

I made this recipe this evening. I added onions and green peppers. It was very good. Just way too spicy. The next time I will use half of the seasoning packet.

Tomatoes cause me to have migraines, so I LOVE this alternative chili. I use a carton of chicken broth and 3 cans of the Great Northern Beans, plus extra chicken to make enough for 2 nights of dinners. It is a little spicy, so be prepared!

Yeah, this is GREAT!!  Added a can of rotel tomatoes, 1/2 chopped onion, about 1/2 cup chopped red & green peppers and 1/2 can diced green chilies. And did not add the water, the juice from the beans & tomatoes made it just right. Served with cheese on top.  Made cornbread with this, a really good dinner!

Nice recipe however I always rinse beans to get all the thick sodium solution off 
I then take ½ to 1/3 of the beans and smash them with a fork to thicken the broth.

Very good recipe! I do add onion while cooking the chicken and a can of petite diced tomatoes. Absolutely delicious with a dollop of sour cream and cheddar cheese!

I love this seasoning and so does my family.  I have a large family so I added white corn and diced tomatoes and extra beans and chicken (two full 6 quart crockpots ). The packet makes this dish so easy.  I do brown my chicken first with onions before adding to crockpot.  Corn bread, Cheddar cheese and sour cream top off a great cold weather dish.

I love this stuff. Have been making it for several years. A couple years ago I needed to really stretch a pot of this. And man o man it just made it better. Even gave a care package to a neighbor who doesn't cook but wanted to make his girlfriend dinner. It was a hit. 
I add to the recipe on package a second can of white beans, two cans of corn, all undrained. Then I stir in one cup of white rice and four cups of water. Let simmer for 40 minutes and voila. A or of heavenly tasting food that everyone really likes a lot and requests again and again. Sour cream on top or your favorite cheese. From cheddar to mozzarella have been added. Enjoy this as this is easy to make and very filling and tasty too.

Yummy! I really enjoyed this recipe.... It was a great change from ground beef chili. I rated this 4/5 because my boyfriend thought it was just okay. He seemed to like it better the next day for his lunch.

We absolutely love this white chicken chili mix, I omit the beans and add a can of corn instead and one red and one green bell pepper chopped. Also for a little bit of a kick a small can of Ro-Tel smooth sauce. It is so delicious.
