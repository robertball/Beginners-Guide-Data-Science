VERY EASY! Took about 10 minutes to put together.  Excellent combination of flavors.  The only thing I did  not do was the bacon.  Don't get me wrong, I love bacon, just not on everything.

I made this, but with a few changes that I feel enhanced the dish. Halved my sprouts, as well as quartered my potatoes. I seasoned the chicken on both sides before putting in the pan, with salt, pepper and cumin. Added more cumin when I added vegetables and just a dash of cayenne pepper.  Cooked for an additional 20 minutes because veggies were not done when I checked it at 30 mins. Everything came out perfect.

This was a good base recipe but rather bland. After 35 minutes the potatoes weren’t cooked so I covered in foil and cooked another 20 minutes. That ensured everything was cooked. Next time I think I’ll separately coat the veg and the chicken in ranch seasoning. I’ll also cook the bacon as much of it came out soggy and i hate bacon that’s not crispy.

My husband doesn't like chix thighs or brussel sprouts,  so I used chix breasts and chunked vadalia onions with the potatoes.  I think it turned out pretty well....(I would have loved the brussel sprouts). I baked it for an hour, and it was all done well.  Flavors were good!

Not impressed. If I try this recipe again, I will parboil the potatoes and Brussel sprouts. The chicken was done in 35 minutes but the vegetables were not. I will also cut the amount of garlic in half.  The garlic was overpowering.
