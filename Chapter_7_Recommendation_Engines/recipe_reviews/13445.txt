I've made this soup 4 times in a month, it tastes exactly like Chili's restaurant enchilada soup which is my favorite.  I only use 5 tortillas to put in the chix broth, so it's not as thick. I also add one can of chopped chilis.  I take the rest of the tortillas and cut them into thin strips and fry them in a little olive oil to make crispy strips to put in the soup for a bit of crunch....delicious!!!!! I made it for a group of people yesterday, they raved and raved!

This is a wonderful creamy soup that is great when short on time. I use a roasted chicken (shredded),  one large can of green sauce (no red sauce) and a small can of green chilis (no jalapeno).  Add more broth if it gets too thick.  I use a stick blender and give it a few whirls in the pot to smooth out the soup.  top with grated cheese, sour cream, avocado, and tortilla strips. (My husband makes strips by cutting corn tortillas into 1/4"x3" pieces, laying them on a paper towel in the microwave and cooking for less than a minute.  Watch it well as it will burn quickly!!!)

Very good, but I think it needed some tweaks to make it 5 stars. Ten tortillas is too many for the amount of liquid...I cut it to 8 and still needed to add more broth. Granted, it gave me more soup, but it was also a bit bland since I didn't have more enchilada sauce to match the amount of broth. I used fat free half-and-half just to cut calories and obviously fat! Next time I'll do 4 or 5 tortillas and maybe a bit of cayenne...and I'll definitely make it again.

This is an excellent recipe! Very versatile, as it can be eaten as soup or used as a dip for chips or crackers. I have done both.

Tasted just like enchiladas!  Very easy to make and delicious!  Made enough for 4 generous servings.  The tortillas did turn to mush, so if you don't like a chowder consistency, add them at the end and allow to soften slightly before serving.  Either way, delicious!!  Will definitely make again and again.

This is a WONDERFUL soup.  It is sooo much like the enchilada soup at a popular eating establishment.  Trust me... you won't be sorry you tried it.  Now I wasn't too sure about the corn tortillas with the chicken broth but it worked really well as a thickening base.

I didn't have the corn tortillas so the soup was much thinner than it should have been.  Added some extra spices- cumin and chili powder to kick up the flavor.  Fresh chopped green pepper, cheddar cheese, and tortilla chips were an excellent topping.

Everyone loved it.  We spread on it crackers, cocktails rye and dipped with tortillas - couldn't go wrong with any of them.  Hotness Hint: If you don't want too much of a kick, eliminate the jalapeno.

Very good recipe! Simple and tasty. I poached the boneless chicken thighs I used right before I made the soup, so I had extra, salt-free broth to thin it with as it got too thick. Tasting too salty would be the only concern I have with this yummy soup, tho' that is just a matter of taste. This is very good.

Awesome! It does remind me of Chilli's soup! I used only 5 tortilla's based on other reviews and I also added a can of green chilies when I added the sauce! (Instead of jalapenos) It was so easy to make!! And it was all gone, and I can't wait to make it again!

This is so easy and good.  I use precooked roasters for the chicken when in a hurry.  We had it during the  Christmas holidays and it was a big hit.

This soup is absolutely fantastic.  It *does* taste pretty much exactly like Chili's!  I made this for a dinner party and everyone raved and asked for the recipe.  I followed the recipe to the T, except:  I doubled the recipe and after reading the reviews decided to only use 11 tortillas for the whole double recipe.  If I had to do it over again I think I would have used more tortillas, maybe 15 or 16.  It came out a bit thinner than I had intended.  One more note - I bought medium green enchilada sauce and medium red enchilada sauce, and with the spice of those two and the cumin it was PERFECTLY spicy.  It had a wonderful kick.  I couldn't imagine topping it with jalapeno, it would have been too spicy.  Instead I topped it with tomato, shredded cheese and some thin tortilla strips I had fried up.  Everyone mentioned that the crunchy tortilla strips really made the soup, so I highly recommend that.  It was nice to have something to crunch.

Good base but even better with some additions:  added sauteed onion and garlic and a handful of frozen corn as I like to have something to "chew on."  Used rotisserie chicken, green enchilada sauce only (forgot to buy red), and added cheese to the soup instead of on top.  Everyone LOVED this!

Love this soup!!!  Wish I would have doubled the batch so I had left overs it was so good!  I did you flour tortillas instead, only cause that is what I had at home......made soup a lot thicker than expected but still very tasty!!

Really good! I doubled the recipe, but kept the enchilada sauce at one cup and just added a can of diced tomatoes.  I boiled my chicken, so I just used the broth from that.  Also toasted up some corn tortilla strips in the oven (sprayed with olive oil, then broiled 2-3 mins) for topping.  OH yea, and I added a bag of frozen sweet corn and a can of rinsed black beans...MMMMMM!! GREAT!! Thankx!

If I could give this 4.5 stars, I would. It was a very good soup. I am currently eating what is left for lunch and it is even better! I do think next time I am going to brown my chicken with some garlic. I also added onion powder, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Thanks for a great recipe.

Very Good!  I am a big fan of the chicken enchilada soup from Chili's (restaurant)...and this one is totally better!  
The only thing I did different from the recipe is that I added one full 14oz can of chicken broth instead of what it called for, and I only used two chicken breasts that I had boiled and diced.
The rest I did the same, but I may have been a little heavy handed on the enchilada sauces.
It turned out perfect, my husband loved it and he hates the Chili's version.
Also, be sure not to forget the jalenpenos, tomatoes and cheese at the end...it makes it perfect! (Tostitos went very well with it!)

This recipe is great!  Exotic without being difficult.  We are a family of four with to very little ones.  The children have not acquired a taste for soups so I have the recipe.  Next time I will do the full recipe and freeze half without the tortillas..to be added later.

If this were named something different it would be a nice soup. But, it is called 'chicken enchilada soup' and it doesn't taste like an enchilada at all. The sauce gets lost in the tortillas, broth and 1/2 & 1/2. Maybe replacing the 1/2 & 1/2 with sour cream would help. I think I want a soup that is less creamy and more tomato based. Will keep trying and may post my own creation soon.

Great tasting soup.  I used the HEB brand tortillas that are refrigerated.  I didn't cook them first but would recommend cooking before adding to soup. Family said it was a little doughy even when using just 5 tortilla.  But has a great taste.

This soup had a lot of great flavor but I think I would use less corn tortillas next time as it was very thick.  I did have to add a little extra milk.

Very, very good soup.  I deleted the tortilla chips in it per suggestions.  I wish it were a little thicker.  I also fried some tortilla strips and sprinkled them on top when I served- loved the crunch!  Next time I am going to try to thicken it up...any suggestions?

I subbed flour tortillas (just two) and used the full can of green enchilada sauce since it was just over a cup.  I also used two cans of chicken, and fat free half-and-half.  Next time I would use regular chicken breast.  Overall very tasty!  I also dumped in a can of Ro-tel for the tomatoes and jalapeno.

YUMMIES!  This recipe was super easy and my husband and I loved it.  I sauteed 2 chicken breasts in a skillet and pulsed them a few times in the food processors to get really nice shredded chicken, and I could only afford a big can of red sauce, so omitted the green entirely.  I also added a can of cheddar cheese soup and a can of regular kernel corn, some paprika and ground white pepper.  Served with shredded sharp cheddar and sour cream, and boy what a treat!  I haven't seen my hubby dive into a soup like that EVER. I definitely recommend this recipe.

This was a very fast and easy recipe.  I did change some things though.  Instead of using the red and green enchilada sauce (which I didn't have), I used a full reicpe of the Ten Munute Enchilada sauce from this sight.  I then cooked the cut up chicken in the broth (I used a full can).  When the chicken was done, I removed it and added the tortilla strips.  I only used 5 tortillas for this.  When the tortillas were mushy, I used an immersion blender to smooth the mixture out.  I then continued with the recipe as written.  I did add some frozen corn at the end.  Next time I may add some black beans.  I did top with shredded cheese and fried tortilla strips.  This was really good!!!

This is really good. I made it vegetarian and skipped the chicken. I also did not use green salsa, but instead the canned green chilies.

Delicious! Had to alter due to what was on hand and there is way too much snow on the ground for a trip to the store. Left out hte corn tortillas and didn't have any half and half. Subbed 1/2c heavy cream and 1/2c milk added some frozen corn and half a can of fire roasted tomatoes salsa style. Will be making per the directions next time. Thanks!

I made this soup with the suggestions of reviewers. Therefore, I used left over chicken breast. 2 cans of chicken broth 1 can each of red and green enchilada sauce, 1 teaspoon each of cumin and chili powder and extra for additional flavor, 1 can of cheddar soup, 1 can of rotel original tomatoes and a half of onion.  I sauteed the onions added the broth, enchilada sauces, cumin, chili powder, chicken rotel, and cheddar soup until hot. I then fried fresh tortillas for the top of the soup. It was really good. I look forward to making it again.

I have made this twice.  The first time I followed the recipe.  I found the corn tortillas really obnoxious.  I also thought it needed a cheesier taste.  This time when I made it a I used masa harina to thicken and added Velveeta to taste.  I also added a can of diced tomatoes.  It was exceptional and I couldn't keep myself away from it.  It is excellent as a dip as well.

We really enjoyed this soup. Based on our own tastes I added 1 can of corn (drained), I can of Rotel (drained; instead of chopped tomato). I only used the red enchilada sauce and five corn tortillas. Black beans would be good too, but hubby is not a big bean fan so I didn't add them. I used Taco Seasoning I from the site for the season and used 2 tbsp. Perfect!

This soup was excellent!!  I added 1/2 tsp of chili powder and added a small can of diced chilis.  I also used a large can of chicken...next time i would use an additional small can of chicken.  I used 7 tortillas in the soup and with 3 of the tortillas, I cut them up, sprayed them with Pam and then put them in the oven under low broil.  I can't wait to eat the leftovers!

This was pretty good.  The enchilada sauce gives it a very different snokey chili flavor.  I used fresh chicken broth that I freeze when I boil my chicken to shread the meat.  I also used my fresh frozen shredded chicken.  I added lots of fresh cilantro because we love it.  My favorite to all tortilla soups are adding half a lime squeezed and dropped in.  I still have my favorite tortilla soups, but this one was pretty good.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a really easy and tasty soup. To save some time I did cook my chicken breast in the crockpot with some taco seasoning and then prepared the rest of the recipe as stated. I did add some cumin, frozen corn, and toped each bowl with some green onions, and sour cream. This gave it a true "enchilada" taste. I will make this again espically since it was so quick to prepare.

I usually buy a tortilla soup mix at the store.  They were out, time was short and with a little variation based upon ingredients found in my kitchen, I found that this recipe formed a great base.  I only had red enchilada sauce, heavy whipping cream, chicken broth, and a package of roasted corn chowder powder.  I added 16 oz of water to thin it a bit.  Turned out really good.  I use shredded chicken, and top it off with minced cilantro, sour cream and tortilla strips.

Absolutely amazing, wonderful, easy to make, hearty soup!  The only caution is that if you are allergic to MSG as I am find Green Enchilada Sauce without it.

This is one of my favorite soups.  So easy to make and delicious.  Even better the second day if you have any leftover.  I use a whole can of chicken broth and also a whole can of green chile sauce, and it doesn't make one bit of difference.  And the tortillas will soften and get mushy as one reviewer noted.  That's what gives the soup it's thickness.

This is a very vesatile recipe.  I uaed vegetable broth and tofu instead of chicken....YUMMY!  I also halfed the tortillas to make it a little less thick.  Next time, I will try it without the cream and just offer sourcream or yogurt as a topping! I highly recommend this!

This was a great base but  I think the ratios of ingredients may be off. I made some changes and was told that I should make it again. Here are my updates.  In place of the corn tortillas, I subbed 1/3 C masa harina/corn meal.  I thought this amount thickened it up just fine. I used a 12 oz jar of salsa verde in place of the green enchilada sauce- my store only had red. I added 1 1/2 tsp of chili powder, and I minced 2 jalapeños and added them to the pot.  I used 4 1/2 C of chicken broth.  This served 4 large portions plus left overs.  I threw all the ingredients plus the raw chicken in the crockpot on high for 4 hours and 2 on low.  Garnished with sour cream, tortilla chips and cheese. Delicious for a wintery day.

Wanted to make a chicken enchilada soup, but didn't want to buy the usual masa harina most recipes call for.  The crushed tortilla chips worked like a charm!  I probably tripled most of the ingredients, using the chicken poaching liquid for the broth.  Also added chopped celery, green pepper, carrots and garlic.  I simmered this soup several hours before adding the cream and cheese so the chips were well incorporated, which is okay. Just served the soup over fresh chips in the bottom of the bowls and extra cheese to sprinkle over top. An enchilda in a bowl - yum!

I needed to make this quick, so I cut raw chicken into cubes, used olive oil to fry the chicken in the pot used the cumin to season....then I followed the recipe.   My husband likes it hot so I put the jalapeño right into the soup.   It got too hot so I added some black beans and some left over frozen corn....  delicious!!!

I followed the directions to the tee and mine does NOT look like that picture at all. It tastes okay though. Not what I expected.

I used this as a basic recipe and tweaked it to what I had on hand.  I also added some whole kernel corn and ranch style beans to make it more hearty for our family.  Even my rather fussy grandson ate some and said it made his cold feel better.  :)

Yes, it was easy but almost too easy. I added a can of Diced rotel tomatoes with green  chilis and sauteed red bell peppers and that made it more chicken encilada. I used Doritoes nacho chips in it and it was great!

This was so good.  It's summer here and soup is on the bottom of my list but I'm glad I made it anyway.  I didn't have chicken breast so I used legs and thighs.   My chicken was grilled and added one ingredient that I do to this type of dish.  My husband loved it.  The portion size is generous.  It's easy to make and I'll do it again soon.

I made a version of this yesterday and it was wonderful!  First I cooked my chicken by simmering it in the chicken broth (1 box).  After cooking there was 1 1/4 cups of broth left - perfect! I increased cumin to 1 1/4 tsp. and added a can of Rotel for a little zip.  When I served it, I topped with tortilla chips, cheese, onion and avocados.  Really enjoyed this!

Yum! This recipe is definitely a keeper! I think next time I'll add a packet of enchilada mix to spice it up even more. 
PROS: The spices were delicous! 
CONS: I had to add more chicken broth, as the tortillas made it very thick.

WOW ITS HOT! I'll be honest, I'm a whimp . . but this was WAY WAY too much for me!! I should have went with my gut and not of add much or any red (medium) sauce!!  Too cool it off and thin it out, I added 1 more cup of (FF) half and half, added about 6 oz of a pale ale beer. Its was still too hot.  Thus I added a can of creamed corn.  Boy was that a mistake! LOL Then it be came too sweet!! Then I had to add more green salsa! Its ok now, still a little too sweet! I shouldn't have added the WHOLE can of cream corn! But next time I think I will leave the red out all together and I will be MUCH happier! Again, I am a wimp and I know it! For the record, no! I didn't add the jalapeno!  And it was still to hot for me!! BUT I am going to try and make it again!! It held up to all my additions very well!! And I didn't change it until I tasted it!!!

First thing I have to say is that I NEVER follow a recipe exactly. I’m always adding or subtracting. I can’t give stars on the original recipe but the version I made is definitely five stars.   I had no cumin so I didn’t add it but I did add some chili powder and a bit of taco seasoning. I cooked the broth and the strips in the pot and then added the red sauce, green sauce, milk (didn’t have half and half) and then I also added a can of Ro-Tel (Diced tomatoes and green chilies) and another small can of green chilies. I cooked it until it was heated but it seemed too soupy to me so I tore up a few more (maybe 6?) tortillas and threw them in and let them get soft. (I loved the tortillas pieces when I ate it.) I also added about a cup of the shredded cheese into the soup and let it melt.   I dropped a dollop of sour cream in a bowl, spooned the soup over top and served it with some homemade corn chips. Excellent! My three year old had seconds! Also, it made a whole lot more than four servings.

Only thing I did different was use 6 white 6-inch corn tortillas, and the consistency was perfect.  I think shredded chicken works best for my tastes.  This is definitely a "keeper" recipe in my house!

I really enjoyed this soup, and I did make some changes.  Didn't know how big the tortillas were based on the recipe, so I bought the medium sized ones and cut up 3 of them for the base with the stock.  Used 2c. chix stock, and used both cans of enchilada sauce.  
Very thing and very good!

This was delicious! I couldn't find green enchilada sauce here in England, but it turned out great with just the red kind. I added some green and red peppers, and left out the jalapenos (it was spicy enough without them). I lightly fried up some tortilla strips to put on top for a little crunch too. Hubby has asked for this again! Very filling with a great kick.

I used all red enchilada sauce as that's what I had, and no jalepenos as I hate them.  It was very good but I thought a bit on the hot side.  I added some extra chicken broth and a bit of sugar to dilute and cut heat, but was still drinking water every 3 spoonfuls.  (This was withOUT the jalepenos, but I also am unfamiliar with green enchilada sauce and perhaps it is milder than red?)  I didn't find the tortillas mushy.  I let them cook way down, even to the point they just started sticking -- they unstuck later.

I noticed quite a few people didn't like the mushyness of the tortillas.  You can do like I do when I make my own version of this soup.  To thicken just mix your half and half and some flour together and use that to thicken the soup.  Hope this helps:)

My family loved this!  They are already ashking for more. The tortillas do get mushy, I thought I had done something wrong, but it turned out great!  I used leftover turkey instead of chicken and added more broth.  It is spicey, and I left off the jalepenos!

This was good but a bit thick even though I had used more chicken broth. Everyone thought it was a bit spicy but I didn't. Served with sour cream, colby-monterey jack cheese and crispy tortilla strips.

Yummy!! I added a can of "spicy" tomatoes and some corn. We topped it with some avocado, cheese and sour cream. Really GOOD!

I thought this was quite bad.  The tortillas turned to mush when simmering.

Easy to prepare but the soup pot was a mess to clean up since the tortillas stuck to the bottom of the pot.  The taste was too rich -- possibly using milk instead of half&half would help but I'll continue my search for the ultimate tortilla soup recipe.

This was so quick, simple and very tasty.  My husband had 2 bowls! My stepson and son (18 months) loved it too! Would definitely recommend this to my friends.

Excellent recipe, watch the cumin seed and gage spiceyness through the enchilada sauce.

This is going to be another favorite with our family.  I substituted tomatoes for salsa.  It came out slightly spicy....perfect!
