I've been testing fudge recipes lately, so I've had the opportunity to compare.  Most other recipes topped this one; this one is too much trouble for what is really a marshmallow-type fudge, and it's a little icky (over-sweet, over-rich, over-soft).

Very good and creamy fudge.  I would suggest lining the pan with parchment or waxed paper before poring in the fudge so you can just lift it out for ease in cutting.  Great recipe, thanks!

This is a great recipe for fudge. Very smooth and creamy. I think the people that have reviewed this recipe by saying it was grainy, did something wrong. My guess is they used mini-marshmallows instead of the large ones. That would definately make them grainy.

Excellent fudge. This was the first fudge recipe I tried to make and it turned out great. It's a little rich for me but my husband and our son just love it.

I was not pleased with this fudge.  For me, it was grainy and did not set well (way too soft). I make fudge a lot, so I am pretty sure I did it correctly.  Also, it was almost too rich tasting.

In making this fudge,it was fine tasting, but to gooey.  I had to work with it a bit and add 21/2 cups of powdered sugar after I brought it up to a soft ball stage on the stove.  After letting it cool for another 24 hours, it was fine and had the texture that fudge should have.  I believe the original recipe had a bit to much butter in it, and a bit to much granular sugar.

Sorry, I had high hopes for this but fudge it ain't. Tastes exactly like what it is - melted chocolate chips. If you've never actually tasted real homemade fudge you likely won't know the difference, but if you have, skip this recipe and stick with cocoa and a candy thermometer - more work, but the result is worth it.

This is delicious! It was the result of an evening family craving so I didn't have quite all the ingredients on hand and had to make a couple substitutions. Instead of the marshmellows, I used 1.5 cups of marshmellow creme. Plus since I only had semi-sweet chocolate chips, I just used a 12 oz bag of those and skipped the milk chocolate chips. Really enjoyed it!

If this turned out grainy for you, not dissolving the sugar in the milk is what did it. Not using mini marshmallows as someone else posted. All fudge is slightly grainy, it isn't supposed to be the texture of brownies. This recipe was very good, the only change I made was leaving out the nuts. Fudge is supposed to be overly-sweet and very rich. that's why they are cut into tiny pieces.

Ok. I made this recipe twice, first time I made it I forgot to put the butter in it. It turned out great.
Second time I made it I put the butter in and it was way too soft. Just forget the butter altogether. *update* only used semi-sweet chocolate chips, if you want a darker tasting fudge, that's  the way to go.

Have made this recipe many times. Do have to agree that if you do not like rich food, you shouldn't make this. The people who achieve grainy results have definitely done something wrong. Came out Grainy for me when i used 2% milk instead of whole milk.

This was a very simple and doable recipe, but a little soft for fudge.  Perhaps more powdered sugar in the final mixing would help.  But very tasty anyway, what's not to like about fudge?  I made a second batch using dark chocolate cocoa powder and it was fabulous.

This fudge is probably the best I ever had! It came out very creamy and perfect consistency. I did substitute the semi-sweet and milk chocolate chips for dark chocolate in one batch and white chocolate chips in the other. It was very quick and easy, I can't wait to make it again next year! Thanks!

This was the best and easiest chocolate fudge I have ever made. My whole family loves it. It's perfect. I did however use coco powder instead of the unsweetened chocolate because that was all I had on hand and I followed the advice of a previous reviewer to line my pan with wax paper for easier cutting and clean up. Wonderful!

A couple tips: Let the sugar mixture boil for more than two minutes. Take it to about 5 minutes; let it get the color of a light caramel. Also, stir, stir and stir some more. You want to stir this until it looks shiny and glossy like it's very, very wet. This will take away the grainy texture and allow for a smooth, hard product once it sets. Also, go very light on the vanilla. About a drop, just to scent the fudge mixture, is more than enough. With the amount called for here, it ends up tasting like chocolate from cookies or a cake and not that rich, deep chocolate you'd expect with fudge.

I had to halve the recipe because of limited marshmallows. I didn't have milk chocolate chips or unsweetened chocolate squares, so I subbed in 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips, 3 tbsp of cocoa, an extra 1 tbsp of butter, and added some confectioner's sugar to make up for it. Because I made a smaller batch, I used an 8" x 8" pan. Turned out great!! Super chocolatey and smooth! Definitely a keeper.

This was EXACTLY the recipe that I was looking for: I'd lost it to someone I lent it to.  Cool that someone else recognised its wonderful flavor and ease to make!
