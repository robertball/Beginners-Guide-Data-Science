This was simple and good. I doubled the recipe, omitted the milk in the pasta, used olive oil, and added an extra egg. This helped the pasta crust stick together. I also added ground beef and olives to the toppings and cooked it at 400 degrees because I was in a hurry and that was no problem either. Simple and yummy. I'll do it again!

Tasty but a lot of fuss for what is just pasta in tomato sauce with sauted vegs. and cheese. Didn't slice well.

I used about 3 cups of pasta (it was half way cooked when I found this recipe, I used it anyway) mixed with the egg, milk and cheddar cheese. Topped with a can of green beans, cooked on 400 for 15 minutes, took it ou, added tomato sauce, more cheddar (a handful) and back at 400 for 15 minutes. My 2 year old never ate so much! She had 4 plates! My 1 year old loved it also! It was PERFECT. No seasonings added!
