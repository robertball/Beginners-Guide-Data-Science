fantastic!  We have a local restaurant (cafe rio) that has a chocolate cheesecake flan, that I have been trying to find a recipe for.  This is it!  Wonderful!  I did substitute chocolate chips for the bakers chocolate since I didn't have any.  And I topped with strawberries and whipped cream instead of chocolate.

I followed this recipe to the note and it came out very good. Had some issues getting it out of the cake pan so the edges ended up kindof rough but it tasted great.

Also, make sure you cool this completely before refrigerating, otherwise your caramel will crack and alot will stick to the pan. Overall a wonderful treat with not much work!

This is a wonderful recipe for those who like flans and cheesecake.  Refreshingly lighter than plain New York Style cheesecake, but a slightly more sensual flavour than a simple flan. I agree that it can be tricky to pop out of the pan.

This has become a family favorite.  It's very rich, and the texture is more like cheesecake than flan, which is good for those who don't like a flan with an egg-y texture.  My husband and kids ask for this every holiday!
