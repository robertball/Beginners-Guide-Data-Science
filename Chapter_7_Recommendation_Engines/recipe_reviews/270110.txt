There will probably be a couple of questions that will come up a ton so I thought I would post the answers and perhaps keep people from hesitating to make the recipe. First, he uses only one egg in the video but the recipe calls for two. The reason is that for the video he only made 1/2 batch. It's easy to miss that part. Second, you can't substitute ANYTHING for the tapioca flour/starch (both names are used on packaging, however, the product is exactly the same. Names are interchangeable) 

Having said that, this recipe is by far the easiest recipe I have ever made vs. the output. Never have I had so many compliments and pleas to make more for a recipe that required only 4-7 minutes of EASY prep. I used my KitchenAid mixer with the paddle attachment but did not vary anything else.
These are amazing!

These are so good. I couldnâ€™t get mine as smooth on the outside, but the chewy inside and taste were spot on. I did a half batch like the video for my family of three and there are none left.

These cheese buns (aka Chipa) are delicious. Ever since I started eating gluten free, I've made these buns frequently. Everyone enjoys them. They are warm, gooey, cheesy comfort food. If you are lucky enough to have a few left over, they freeze well too.
