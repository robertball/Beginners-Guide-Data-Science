Made a lot of changes. First we didn't grill them. It was a freaking 13 below outside. I fried them until they were brown on the outside and then tossed them into the crockpot with the Rice Vinegar Basting Sauce recipe from this website. I also used dried lemon grass, since fresh is never available to me. (If anyone has a better way to reconstitute lemon grass so it isn't woody, I'd love to hear it.) I served this as an appetizer to dinner guests and they loved it.

These are tasty as written, but require very young, tender lemon grass to make  I like to add very finely ground pork and use rice flour, but that's another story. For those who are just learning how to use lemon grass, here's the skinny:
Lemon grass is very fibrous when not absolutely fresh. I grow it in a pot at home. Remove the outer leaves until you reach the more tender area inside. Very finely mince the pale, tender part for your recipe. Reserve outer leaves and tops. These can be used to give authentic flavor to Asian soups and broths and strained out. Don't waste them! If your lemon grass is all stiff and dry, chop and pour over a little bit of boiling water. Allow to steep then strain. You'll get the flavor for which there is no substitute. It also comes as a paste in tubes in the produce section which can be used bit by bit by keeping in your freezer. This is a wonderful ingredient so ask your grocer to order some for you .

This recipe is wonderful.  Added soya sauce instead of salt like other users ... had no cornstarch so I added 2 tsp. rice flour ... some fresh thyme and basil from my garden.  Then I refrigerated them for 2 hours.  They stayed together very well and tasted delicious.  Thanx for sharing bbqgirl!

I added fresh ginger and substituted soy sauce for the salt.  The substitution was a mistake and made the meatballs too moist.  Other than that, they tasted great.  The flavors work really well together.  I wanted a sauce to make them a little juicier, but everyone else in my family liked them as they were.

Like one of the other reviews, I added fresh ginger and used soy sauce instead of salt.  I also didn't have oyster sauce, so used black been sauce instead.  Flavor was pretty good, but trying to GRILL these was ridiculous!  I ended up scraping most of it off the grill onto a cookie sheet and broiling them.  I might play with the recipe since it was a different taste for ground beef, but I won't be FOLLOWING this one again.

I prepared the meatballs exactly as directed in the recipe except I baked them in the oven instead of grilling them. They were amazing! I served them with rice vinegar basting sauce and shanghai noodles. My family actually cheered. Very Nice!

While the flavors in this were great, I found my meatballs to be quite fibrous?  Maybe I dont know how to prepare lemongrass.  I just chopped up the whole stalk and then blended with the onion and garlic.  We will probably try again but this time I will have to strain out the woody pulp.

We so enjoyed the meatball meal. Unfortunately we were unable to get the Lemongrass vegetable so I subsutited fresh Chives and green onion for this part of the reacipe, it was just great. Thanks to who ever submitted this one, enjoyed it very much.

Tried these meatballs as I love lemongrass! Used a puree lemongrass as the stalks weren't available. Pureed the lemongrass, onions and garlic and think it would have been better had a I coarsely chopped as the recipe called for. May give them another try.

These were fantastic, and super flavorful!! I used lemongrass paste (comes in a tube), and clam juice (I didn’t have any oyster), a few drops of Worcestershire and an egg (to bind a bit better). I will definitely make these again.

These are listed as low carb but it has ingredients that aren't approved for most low carb diets. Just keep that in mind if you're trying to lose weight.

Very good, but a little on the oily side.  I used lemon grass paste instead of chopped lemon grass, and cooked it on the stove.

Loved it with slight modifications!  (1/2 onion, soy sauce instead of oyster sauce, and 16 meatballs instead of 12).  Served it with spicy dumpling dipping sauce!

I followed the recipe exactly and even overrode my instinct to add an egg and tried to cook it wo a binding agent save for the corn starch! Big mistake! They crumbled as they cooked! Glad it wasn’t on the grill but in my cast iron skillet! I ended up improvising but they were not very flavorful as a sauté! Bland and wasn’t a fan of the texture. Won’t make again. ??

I added a small amount of soy sauce and cut back on the lemon grass, also I used 2X garlic while omitting the onion.  I did not grill them, but cooked in the oven on 425.  I followed the other reviewers' suggestion and glazed them with Rice Vinegar basting sauce for the last 5 minutes and they were excellent! I will definitely make these again.

Dark soy instead of salt,fish sauce instead of oyster sauce golden caster sugar instead of white sugar,added fresh ginger/chilli flakes/chopped corriander(cilantro).
Found it to be a bit wet so added a breadcrumb/readybreak(fine porridge oats)combo till preferred consistency.Baked in the oven.
Overall a nice recipe.

This was wonderful!  I only made 2 changes:  I used 2Tlbs of coconut flour (instead of cornstarch) and I made small patties (rather than skewer them).  My family was delighted!   Everyone agreed that this recipe will be used again and again.  Thank you for sharing!

These turned out very well! I don't have any experience grilling, but the instructions were easy to follow. About 1/4 of the meatballs didn't stay together well though, and they fell apart on the grill. I'll need to look up tips for keeping the meat together better.

These were pretty tasty! They are great for a nice party appetizer or to enjoy just by yourself (like for me tonight). I topped them with a little extra oyster sauce which gave the right amount of saltiness I was missing in the meatball. Next time I make these, I would like to add some pork to the mix.

These were fantastic! I made a half batch without lemongrass for a few folks who don't like, and half with. The lemongrass really adds to the flavour but they were pretty good without as well! Like other reviewers, I added fresh ginger and soy sauce (tamari actually). These have definitely made it in to my regular rotation!!
