Using this recipe with some minor modifications allowed me to prepare better fried okra than my mom!  Instead of plain cornmeal I used a pre-mixed  cornmeal, four, salt mixture.  I also added a little bit of buttermilk to the egg mixture.  I'm sure the use of flour along with the cornmeal is the secret to keeping the batter on during cooking.  Another secret is to make sure your oil is good and hot before adding the okra.

This was good,I'm not a huge fan of cornmeal though,it's too gritty,I found that a combo of 3/4 flour and a 1/4 cup cornmeal works just fine,also I soak mine in milk instead of egg,the eggs much to thick and the okra puts off its own thickness in the milk,after its done soaking the milk mixture's as thick as an egg....with a garden full of okra,I've fried my fair share this summer

Oh my goodness, this was the best ever!  It turned out perfectly.  It was my first time making fried okra, so I paid close attention to the prior reviews and this is what I did.....I used frozen okra and let it thaw about half way.  I beat an egg and mixed in equal parts milk.  I poured the partially thawed okra in the bowl of egg/milk and I gently stirred to coat.  I actually stirred it every 5 min or so and let it soak for about 15 min.  I used half corn meal and half flour with salt and pepper, I then put it all in a large zip lock bag.  I added the egg washed okra to the corn meal and gently tossed to coat.  I cooked it in crisco in my 'fry daddy' until it was golden brown.  I was careful not to stir, but I did dunk the okra down with the back of a spoon after about a minute of cooking.  This was absolutely perfect, just like my grandpa used to make in his old cast iron skillet.  After loosing him last summer at the age of 94, I thought that I would never taste this wonderful veggie again.  Thanks for posting the recipe and thanks to all who gave 'tips' on how to make it with better success!

This is almost the way I make my okra when I have to batter it myself.  I like to cook it with drippings from pork chops or bacon grease too. I always cut up peeled potatoes fairly small and fry them with the okra (with a dash of extra cornmeal if I'm using pre-breaded frozen okra) and a bit of chopped onion doesn't hurt. You can't beat okra fried with potatoes though.  Also, a trick my mom taught me about frying okra, about 2 minutes before you are ready to take the skillet off the stove, carefully add in  2-3 tablespoons of water (cold is fine) then cover the skillet for two minutes. I don't know how it does it, but most all of the slime will be gone if you add water and cover at the end.

This is the first year that I have grown okra in my garden, so of course a good "fried okra recipe" was a must.  I was not disappointed!  Though simple, this recipe was delicious, even better than what I have had in restaurants (I am sure the freshness makes a difference).

I have a piece of advice for any using freshly grown okra: pick it when it is a little smaller size than it can get, as it is more tender.  Slices from larger okra can be a bit tough, and though they still taste fine fried, I didn't enjoy them quite as much.

Soaking in the egg and coating with the basic cornmeal mixture was enough complexity for me - the taste was superb.  (And my 3-year-old non vegetable eater loves it also!)

Quick and easy!!  I was out of cornmeal, so I used 1/2 cup flour and 1/2 cup breadcrumbs in its place.  Plus I added a little bit of grated parmesan cheese, it was very good and I did not notice a difference.

Oh my goodness!  This is as good as you can get in any restaurant.  I was a little worried because the egg coupled with the okra's natural "stickiness" made sort of an ooey-gooey mess when I tried to roll them in the cornmeal mixture.  But once they went into the oil, they fried up perfectly and were deelish!  In fact, I'm making them again tonight!  Thanks.

Although not very healthy, (I just keep telling myself it's a green vegetable, so it IS healthy! lol) this recipe is definately simple southern cooking at its best.  I think next time I'll not slice my okra quite so thinly so I can taste more okra flavor instead of mostly oil.  My grandma always cooked summer squashes (yellow or zucchini) and mushrooms this way and they are so good also.

Good southern recipe! Here's a tip I found on another site to avoid the sliminess that okra produces: Soak your sliced okra in enough cold water to cover it, then squeeze in the juice of one lime and let your okra sit for 10 to 15 minutes before you cook it. Best tip I've encountered yet.

Good ... but, people, keep in mind: This is fried okra, NOT batter-dipped okra. Some of the breading WILL fall off when you are cooking it ... that is part of the dish, however, the "crunchies" ... handle gently when frying, and it will come out yummy ... thanks for the recipe!

Perfect - after making a few minor adjustments. I followed the advice of other reviewers and used 1/2 flour and 1/2 cornmeal, which gave the okra the perfect, crunchy texture. To keep the breading from falling off, first make sure your oil is very hot before adding the okra. Place the okra in the pan carefully, and then wait a couple of minutes before moving them until you are sure that the breading has set on the bottom (they will be light golden brown on the bottom). Once the breading has set on the first side, gently flip the okra over and don't move it again for another couple of minutes until the breading has set on the second side. After that... stir away! This may be the best fried okra I've ever had (and I'm from the South, so that's saying something)!

I found that it sticks to the okra better with 3/4 c flour and 3/4 c cornmeal. Also, if you're using frozen okra (c'mon who doesn't want fried okra in the freezing winter?!) make sure that it's thawed ALL the way or the coating will slip off in the hot oil.

Love fried okra!  Made this tonight and did not make a mess of it :)  I think the best thing about this recipe is the cooking method.  Whether you use the same ingredients or not, to start with hot oil keeps them from absorbing too much.  I love to prepare these at home cuz you can control the doneness.  I prefer to have the okra still taste like okra and the little seeds pop between my teeth when I eat it, therefore less time cooking the better.  One more thing, I also prefer larger pieces...1/2 to 3/4 inches and I add a little cayenne to the flour.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I changed it up quite a bit, but this recipe gave me the courage to attempt frying okra.  I soaked a bag of frozen okra in a mixture of 2 beaten eggs and a cup of milk for about 20 minutes, then tossed the pieces in a big ziplock bag of a cup of cornmeal, 1/4 cup of flour, some seasoned salt and pepper, and cooked them in hot oil for about 6 minutes.  I had no trouble whatsoever with the coating falling off the cooked pieces, and it tasted perfect.  Thank you!!!

I have Okra in the garden and it grows so quick we are always trying to prepare it differently.  I liked this as I was able to do it without the deep fryer.  It was so delicious.  We enjoyed it so much we made it two days later again.  I serve it with a horseradish sauce.  This is great with fresh Okra never slimy, it is so crispy and crunchy  - THANKS for tip on mixing flour with corn meal, this is a keeper.

Fresh okra made this recipe, which I had from my garden.  I did half & half corn meal and flour.  All corn meal may have been a little much.  Also added milk to the egg and let the okra sit in the mixture for about 4 mins (got idea from another recipe).  The corn meal mixture stuck to it perfectly.  Cooked on low medium to make sure it did not burn.  Perfectly browned on all sides.  Flipped with a spatula.  I want this again tomorrow night.  The perfect southern side dish!!!!!

This recipe does not work as written!  To get the coating to stay on while you fry the okra you must add a little flour to the cornmeal, your oil temp must be at least 350 degrees and Certainly DO NOT stir!  Just leave it alone, let it brown then turn over ONCE to brown all over.

It is a lot of work to cut, dip, coat okra.  So I did a large batch at one time, but instead of frying it all at once, I baked them on a cookie sheet for 10-15 minutes at 350 (until egg is dry) then put it in the freezer.  I also add extra salt to the uncooked, coated okra before baking.  When I want fried okra for a meal, I just take some from the freezer and drop it in the deep fryer for 3-4 minutes.

Lovely recipe, adds more flavor than breading in simple corn meal and frying.  I added about a teaspoon of Cavendar's Greek Seasoning to a small pack of corn muffin mix and soaked the okra like directed.  Everything came out absolutely delicious.  And this was my first time!  I'm 25 and not very good at frying at all, so I was pretty worried...xD  Nice, easy recipe.  Highly customizable, which is part of the joy of cooking!

I've fried okra in the past by trial and error with tips picked up from different people.  When I found this recipe I was anxious to try it because it sounded pretty easy.  And I was right. I wanted to at least double the recipe because I knew 10 pods would not be enough for the three of us - especially if it turned out good.  I ended up using about 25 pods.  I did as one reviewer suggested and added buttermilk to the egg soak and soaked for about 20 minutes.  For the breading I used equal parts corn meal and flour (double the recipe).  I used the zip lock bag method to coat the okra.  Then instead of frying in a skillet I put about 3/4 inch of veg oil in a 3 qt. saucepan and heated to med high.  I added the okra when it was good and hot and let it cook till it started browning and stirred/turned it again about 3 or 4 minutes later and again in another 3 - 4 minutes.  We ate everybit of it - even the crumbs!

There is trouble with it *as written*.  However, following the great modification suggestions in the reviews -- letting it soak in an egg/milk wash, adding 1 part flour to the 3 parts corn meal coating, and using *deep* frying (not pan frying), without "stirring" was perfect!  

Here's one more suggestion - leave the salt out of the coating mix - it's too hard to guage.  Salt to taste when it's still hot and draining on the paper towels.

Not exactly identical to restaurants' okra, but it tastes delicious. I used 3 eggs and a bit of milk for a pound of frozen okra. I coated the bottom of a cast-iron pan with oil and fried them in 3 batches. Serve them right away because they get cold quickly!

I did 2/3 cornmeal and 1/3 flour just for my preference.  This turned out great - except I had to add extra salt to it at the end.  Then it was perfect! But again that is just my personal taste!

Classic recipe! Loved it.  I always add a little white vinegar to it when it's served.

This was amazing! I made an adjustment because I did not have any cornmeal. I used an entire box of Jiffy corn bread mix instead. I soaked in the egg for about 15 minutes and then poured the Jiffy mixture over the soaked okra. I fluffed it with a fork and them placed the coated okra in the preheated vegetable oil. (It was at 350 degrees).  I did not stir the okra once it was in the oil, I just poked it down with a fork. This was the best okra I have ever had!

This is a very good recipe. I followed some of the recommendations made. I used half cornmeal and half flours. Little milk with the egg. Season the meal and flour well. Try cutting the okra length wise instead of circular makes frying alot easier.

This recipe was a quick addition for our lunch today. My husband loved it. It reminded me of the fried okra my great grandmother from Texas used to make when I was little. I gave it 4 stars because it is unhealthy. But the recipe was correct and it turned out delicious.

Very simple and wonderful recipe! I haven't had fried okra in so long, thank you for the recipe. A couple of suggestions, use a bit of bacon grease (it is already a but of a guilty pleasure why not go all the way). Also I add a bit of Creole seasoning to the dry mix, I always use Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning and omit the salt and pepper.

I only had 8 pods of okra, so I didn't have as many, but they turned out very yummy. I felt like they were missing something though. Not as good as restaurant style. Oh, and I did sort of combine this recipe with Paula Deen's by adding 1 cup of flour (a must for good coating!) cayanne pepper, garlic powder, and salt. I also changed cornmeal to only half a cup.

We grew okra for the first time this summer and had a very prolific crop.  I have been freezing it the whole time, waiting to try this recipe. (I personally do not like okra, but my family loves it.) Today, my freezer decided it was going to quit on me, so I figured I may as well salvage some of the okra that had already thawed.  I added about a TBSP of creole seasoning (homemade from allrecipes.com) for the first two batches then another TBSP for the third batch.  Family liked it all, but best with more creole.  I also deep fried it for 3 minutes per batch. Good recipe, so I'm told!

I made many modifications: Used 1 egg with 1 tablespoon of milk for the dredge. For the coating, I used 1/3 cup of flour, 1/3 cup of cornmeal and 1 tablespoon of cajun seasoning. Pinch  of salt and pepper.  Some of the breading will come off in the process. I personally don't like a ton of coating like the kind they serve in cafeterias. This will make a lighter coating and come out great.

This is a good recipe for true southern fried okra. That said, there is an art to frying okra. The oil has to be very hot, adding flour is necessary, and you really shouldn't stir it. This is almost the exact recipe that everyone I know down south here uses. I have been frying okra for years and sometimes I just can't seem to get it right myself. But I love it.

This is a good basic starting point. I made as directed then, I added my own touches to it. Instead of salt I used 1/4 tsp Cajun seasoning, I then added 3 tablespoons of milk to three eggs, makes it easier to soak  for the recommended time and the batter clings to the okra nicer. A helpful hint if you coat the okra in the batter generously after soaking in the egg wash then place all the okra in a large ziplock plastic bag with the excess dry mix. put in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes to chill, then shake well in the bag before frying the batter will stick better. But over all I enjoyed the recipe.. Thank You for posting it.

We didn’t care much for the cornmeal breading. Too gritty. I liked the flavor of the fried okra itself though. I will make this again, but next time I will use a lighter breading so we can taste the okra over the breading.

This was so wonderful, everyone raved!  I did soak in milk for 15 minutes, drained, but not rinse, and then add a beaten egg.  I then coated in seasoned fish fry.  YUMMY!  Big hint:  Drain on the inside of a broken down beer or cereal box, they stayed crunchy til every last one was eaten!

OUTSTANDING! This is the best fried okra I've ever had - anywhere! Per other reviews and our personal tastes - I used 1/2 c flour and 1/2 cornmeal and about 1 tsp of garlic powder in the dry ingredients. I also thin the egg just a little with milk/water. You can slice the okra thicker if you like - it cooks fine and the flavor just shines through. Thank you for a winner in my recipe box!

FABULOUS!  Although we were out of cornmeal - - so I improvised.... First I let the okra sit in an egg/milk bath for about 10 minutes, then dipped in Italian bread crumbs - fried in vegetable oil until crisp & brown..  My family RAVED about it.. Thank you!!

These were pretty good, but definitely needed more flavor in the breading. I would probably double the seasonings used in the breading, maybe even more.

This is very good with a few changes in my opinion.  I did 1/2 flour 1/2 cornmeal.  Added a little milk to the egg and a tablespoon of honey as well.  I also did a little extra s&p and added some creole seasoning.  Turned out great!  Great base recipe though!

Fried okra is the best.  I am from the south, and it was a staple for Sunday dinner in the summer.  There wasn't any nice looking fresh okra available, so I used frozen.  I too used half cornmeal and half flour, and used a buttermilk/egg mixture.  I dusted the okra in flour prior to putting it in the egg mixture.  This ensured that the coating would stick. I didn't add any extra seasonings, as simple is best for this dish. This isn't the healthiest way to eat okra, but as an occasional treat, it is fine.

Okra isn't popular in Canada, except  in ethnic cuisines, and I've been wanting to try this vegetable. I picked this recipe based on the popularity of fried okra in the southern US and the reviews - and I must say, I'm not disappointed in the least bit. I was a bit unnerved by how slimey the okra is when you cut it, but it's not slimey at all when you eat it. Interesting taste, perfect recipe. I soaked the okra in the egg wash for 10-15 min, stirring it 3x in between. Added about 2 tbs of whole wheat flour to the cornmeal, threw it all in a ziploc bag, and tossed to coat the okra. Filled pan 1cm with Crisco, and fried the okra (burned my finger in the process! :P), drained on a paper towel. The batter stayed on perfectly. Looking forward to trying other okra recipes.

These were tasty, and even though I did half corn meal, half flour, I still had problems getting the batter to stick while frying. I also ended up having to use two eggs, since one didn't really coat all the okra very well.

This worked well for me, and I'm usually unsuccessful at deep frying!  
I let the egg soak on the (frozen, not fresh) okra for a full 10 minutes and then stirred in the cornstarch (halved with flour)and let it sit while the oil heated.  I didn't stir it, just flipped them with a spatula a couple times, and they turned out great. Definitely will be using this recipe again!

This is the best recipe I have found ever. I think the secret is making sure you soak the okra in milk and leave it until you are ready to fry.

A classic as is.  To add a little zest, I like substituting about 2 teaspoons (more or less to taste) of "Tony Chachere's Original Creole Seasoning" in place of the salt and pepper.  I had no problems with the batter falling off.  Make sure you let it soak in the egg long enough, and that it is thourgholy coated before tossing it in the cornmeal mixture.

This was great, very close to what I grew up having in Tennessee. The only recommendations I would make is to cut up half an onion and a green tomato. Add those things to the okra and dredge them as well. Also, liberal pepper and salt complements it very well. Thanks!

I thought the breading was dry.  The okra was tender.  I think it should be more of a batter.

I made this from fresh okra in my garden.  Used 1/2 corn meal 1/2 flour and added a little milk to the egg and soaked for 5-10 minutes before dredge.  Also added a little cayenne to the dredge.  They fried up nicely and coating stayed on.  Delicious

Per other reviews I used about half cornmeal and half flour.  I also used 2 eggs and added a little skim milk (I had a little over 20 pods of okra).  Definitely let the okra sit in the egg mixture for 10 min or so.  Turned out great and super easy! Will definitely make again. Thanks!

Good!  Not a lot of flavor in the batter though.  We added some garlic to help.  Also we did as others before did and used half flour and half cornmeal.  I wonder if they would be even easier to fry if you put them in the fridge for a half hour after coating them with the dry mixture.  We always do that for coconut shrimp.

This was fantastic after a few modifications. I actually added some garlic powder as well as onion powder. My wife said that it was better then Gran Gran's. That's saying a lot cause that woman can cook. It is even good cold. I think the key thing was the extra ingredients as well as cooking it in a cast iron skillet. I'm making it again tonight. Thanks for a great base recipe.

This is only the second time in my life I've made fried okra. The first time was a miserable flop, but having our own garden okra, wanting to try using it in more ways, and the reviews on this recipe inspired me to try again.  Compared to my last experience these were a huge success.  I think the main thing must be soaking the okra slices.  In any case I had so much okra that after following the recipe to the letter, I branched out a bit.  I tried only Corn meal as the recipe states, then tried half corn meal half flour as suggested by another reviewer.  Finally, I tried all flour with the last batch.  I must say I personally liked the all flour one best! My family had varying opinions, although all enjoyed the fried okra.

I loved this!  My boyfriend grew up in Texas and planted some okra in our garden.  I'd never had it before and he asked me to make it for him.  I read this recipe as a guide and used half flour and half fine bread crumbs since I didn't have any cornmeal here.  It was wonderful!  I'm looking forward to trying it with the cornmeal next time I get a good batch of okra from my garden.  Thank you.

I used canola oil instead of vegetable oil. The outside was crispy, the inside was perfect. Will use this batter again. **Tried it with Eggplant - Yum!  The only issue I had with this batter was that it seemed a little bland. I had to salt the food after it was cooked to give it a little more flavor. Next time I think I will add a little more salt and some cayenne to the cornmeal mixture.

this recipe is AMAZING!!! i have never made fried okra before, but i've been craving it for weeks. i did two things differently. i used half flour and half cornmeal. it worked out really well. and, being the god southern girl that i am, i put a few dashes of hot sauce in with the egg. AMAZING! i already knew i'd be putting hot sauce on them and this really hit the spot. a little ranch, and i was a very very happy camper!

This was a great recipe!  I had been looking for a fried okra recipe that would be like the ones I used to have at church as a kid when I lived near Huntsville Alabama...this was it!  I did follow some reviewers advice and used half corn meal, half flour and I used 1 egg lightly beaten with about 1/2 cup soured milk (I didn't have buttermilk as a reviewer suggested so I added a little white vinegar to my non-fat reconstituted powdered milk...it worked great!)  Anyway, my husband LOVED it too and I even caught my 2 year old son trying it...and he liked it! I also had some yellow crook neck squash that I needed to use up so I tossed it in there with the okra.  Fabulous!  I will use this recipe from now on...thanks so much for sharing!!

Tried this one twice, but used a couple of substitutions both times. First time I subbed jiffy mix, but I don't recommend this, as jiffy mix doesn't fry well--it crumbles and falls apart while soaking the oil up. Second time I subbed hush puppy mix, which worked great! For technique, it doesn't say to drain the goo before dredging, but it definitely worked better when I did. Also, medium high on my electric smoothtop is waay too hot, and turning it down in the middle is too late to do any good. I can't really speak to the flavor of plain cornmeal with salt and pepper, I expect it would be fine, though mild. But on technique I give this one 3 stars because you kinda have to know how to treat okra in order to get this recipe to work perfectly--and I'm a novice. :)

This did not turn out very well at all.  The coating came off the okra and it was hard, and not very flavorful.  I would not ever do it this way again.

We were craving okra after a motorcycle trip down south.  This recipe was awesome. I took the advice of other reviewers and added flour to the cornmeal and cooked the okra in a deep fryer.  We will definitely make this again!

Loved it! Fried okra is supposed to have a gritty texture (which this did), but I did add about 1/4 cup of flour. I also added way more salt and especially pepper and onion powder, as I love flavor. I added a small amount of milk to the egg (as others mentioned) and let the thawed frozen okra soak. I then added the okra to the dry mixture and added to the hot oil with a slotted spoon. These were great in ketsup like we have at Cracker Barrel.

this was the best! I used frozen okra thawed and I also used an egg/milk mixture let the okra sit for a while in the egg like it says. I added more salt then what it said to use and i also added some season salt to my cornmeal/flour mixture because it was to bland for me. After all the cooking was done the okra didn't last long. will definitely be keeping this in my recipe box and making again! thanks

I thought these turned out great. This was my first time making fried okra and it was a little time consuming, but they were great!  I did mix a little flour with the corn meal and I fried them in peanut oil. I will definitely make them again.

I love fried okra. But this wasn't the most "adhearing" coating for me and a little to grainy with the cornmeal and all. A little goes along way in terms of the cornmeal, there just needed to be more of a substance to it. I have since then created a very excellent rendition inspired by this recipe - so thank you very much because I wouldn't have attempted it otherwise.

This was a wonderful recipe. The okra turned out delicious. To speed up cooking, I used a pack of pre-cut frozen okra. It saved me a lot of time and cleaning. Thaw the frozen okra under luke warm water and then soak it in the egg. I directly poured the cornmeal into the bowl with the okra and just tossed it around. Also, I used EVOO. It turned out wonderful!! I will definately make this again!

Fantastic recipe, just as written.  Fresh okra not only tastes better than frozen, but it also has a surface that the coating sticks to beter than frozen okra.  Also, select small okra because it is a lot tastier and more tender than large okra.

My husband loves fried okra but I've only ever had 'lady's fingers' in curries. I soaked it in milk and water, and used half cornmeal, half flour as suggested. I thought they quite good but husband really enjoyed them, although he thought they could use a little garlic powder in the coating. Thanks, Linda!

I've been eating fried okra for 30 years, and this is better than my Mom's.  My family loved it.  I will cook my okra this way from now on.  I am sending my Mom this recipe in hopes that she'll try it too.  :)

I added milk to the egg in order to completely cover the cut okra. I used a Louisiana fish fry corn meal to coat the okra after soaking it and then deep fried it at 350 until golden brown. It was the best fried okra I have ever eaten. My father in law agreed! We will be doing this again soon as the okra is growing well in the garden out back.

Full disclosure - I do not like okra.  However, I love a man who loves okra and the CSA gave us a ton of it this week.   The only adjustment I made was adding some flour to the cornmeal & letting it fry with only minimal intervention.  It was a huge hit. 
Thanks for posting!

Yummo!  And very easy! Followed other reviewers and used half flour and cornmeal. Soaking in egg a must. The sticky mess holds the breading on while frying.

I'm not from the south, but I thought this recipe was okay but could be much better with some tweaks. I thought the texture of the cornmeal bredding was good (see my alterations below), but the coating was bland. It either needed: a) to be sweeter b) to be spicier or c) to be accompanied by a dipping sauce like ranch, dill, or horseradish. Something along those lines could easily make this a 5-star recipe. Nevertheless, it was very fun for me to cook and is a good starting point.

Here are my alterations, which are basically what is recommended by several other reviewers: I used 1/2 cup flour (whole wheat white) and 1/2 cup cornmeal for the breading. I also used 1 beaten egg and 1/4 cup of milk.

I would recommend using a cooking thermometer to check the oil temp before you add the dredged okra because everyone's stove is just a bit different. I let my oil get to 375 degrees Fahrenheit before I added the mixture and then dropped the temperature a bit so it stayed between 300 and 350 degrees as recommended on Martha Stewart's site for frying okra.

I loooooove fried okra but hated the mess associated with making it, there is always left over oil and mix. having said that, this recipe is so easy and fantastic, I didn't entirely minded. I didn't have just cornmeal and was thankful another reviewer said a cornbread mix would work as well. I would like a little more batter so next time I will try with flourin the mix.

This is even better than what you can get at Cracker Barrel. As some other reviewers have stated, some breading will fall off during the cooking process.

Prepared it tonight for dinner & "soaking" it in the egg did the trick for keeping the batter on during frying.  Best I've made, yet. Yes, hot oil is required.

The egg taste was a big turn off for me. Okra fried in itself tastes much better!

This is my first time ever even eating okra, and I must say that it was not disappointing.  The only alterations I made were adding some paprika, and frying in sunflower oil instead of vegetable oil.  Will definitely make again!

The cornmeal only barely covered the okra. By themselves it was okay but I made a ranch and chipotle sauce, which made them taste amazing. Overall a decent fried okra recipe. 

I wish there was some kind of spice to it.

I wanted to try something different, so I soaked the okra in a little bit of milk and about 1 teaspoon of lemon juice. ( I wanted to use buttermilk), then followed the recipe.  I needed to add a little bit more salt then the recipe called for.  Good recipe, but very messy to make!

I absolutely love fried okra!! My grandmother used to pick it right from the garden and fry it for me. I tend to use fine white cornmeal mixed half and half with flour, or cornflour and regular flour. It tastes less gritty that way. Very very good though!! This is the exact recipe I follow except for that one change

I made this exactly according to the recipe and it was perfect! My mother is a native Charlstonian and this tastes just like when we go home! Next time, I'll try frying with potatoes like another review did. I love fried Okra and this is a very good simple recipe.

Great base recipe - true southern cooking.  Like other reviewers, I opted to use the egg and 1 tablespoon of milk for the dredge.  I would probably recommend to those who like a crisper piece of okra to slice thinner than the recommended 1/4 inch.  Overall great recipe and thanks for posting!

I'd like to give this a better rating, but as written it just wasn't that good. The breading fell off and the okra wasn't that crunchy. The third batch I made, I used 1/2 cup milk and let the okra sit and absorb it for about an hour. Then dredged it in cornmeal mixed with a bit of zataran's seasoning....much better!!!

I love fried okra, but I was a little disappointed with this recipe. I did everything it said to do, but all the breading came off and it didn't get cooked all the way thru. I don't think 1/2 c. was enough oil. I would suggest NOT mixing frequently and just heating up enough oil to deep fat fry instead.

Finally grew own okra this summer and loved making it according to these directions.  Turned out great.  Then did my own variations too using corn muffin mix and spicing it up with cayenne at the end of the cooking process.  Served it for my sister's family.  We all loved this recipe!

The okra cooked using this recipe was very good but I think if I make this receipe again I will try the Jiffy mix or half flour/half cornmeal mix.

Just what I was looking for.  I'm from the south so fried okra is near and dear to me.  I followed the review for using frozen okra and it came out great.  I didn't have cornmeal on hand so I used 1 c of jiffy mix and 1 c of flour for the breading.  I gave this recipe 4 stars only because of the changes I had to make otherwise it would have gotten a 5.

After being given okra from someone's garden, I decided to recreate the side dish I love when I travel down south.  This was a great recipe!  I did use Jiffy corn muffin mix instead of plain cornmeal and loved it.

These were great!  If you can believe it, I was out of eggs, so I subd Buttermilk.  I think they worked out even better, the breading totally stayed on for me.  Just make sure you dont turn them too often.  Wait til they are very crisp, then turn once. I also had to put a lot of salt at the end, but thats okay!

My husband loved these and my kids who hate okra gobbled them down.  Made them with just-picked okra from the garden and deep fried them.  I let the okra slices sit in the egg for about 15-20 minutes, turning every once in a while.  Would recommend a little extra salt right after they come out of the fryer.  I had no problems whatsoever with the batter coming off.

I used frozen okra and let it thaw about halfway before cooking. Skipped the salt and pepper and used Tony's creol mix instead. I used my deep fryer and didn't have a problem with the coating falling off. I think if you let the okra cook for a few minutes before stirring it will have a better chance of sticking.

I didn't have any trouble with the coating falling off during cooking, but I didn't "stir continuously" either. I also used cut, frozen okra, which seemed to help it hold its shape and coating.

My husband and I recently moved away from Texas, and I immediately began craving my Southern comfort foods. I had a terrible craving for some good ol fried okra, and I could not find it anywhere in the stores. When I asked the grocer they looked at me like I was crazy. They had never even heard of it. I was excited when I saw this recipe, but it just didn't work out for me. When placing the okra in the oil, most of the batter fell off. We ended up eating it, but it wasn't battered. And it certainly didn't hit my "Southern Fried Okra" craving. It wasn't bad, but I was a bit disappointed.

Best if you have fresh okra.  I added the recommended creole seasoning, soaked the okra in egg and milk and it was the best fried okra we've ever enjoyed.

Not very flavorful, and you will need to add alot more oil to make it fry well without your cornmeal falling off. Also you could try using flour instead.

disgusting.  all the batter fell off during the first two seconds of frying.  what's left is slimy okra and fried cornmeal.  i don't know how others got this recipe to work; i found it to be a disaster!  sorry!

Fried okra is a favorite of ours and we grow more than enough in our garden!  We love it just dredged in cornmeal, but it is even better when fried up with diced potatoes.  My girls eat it like candy!

I've never fried okra before, and this came out delicious. The only modification I made was using 1/2 flour, 1/2 cornmeal. Yummy!

i have tried before to fry okra and by the time you got your hands in the egg and flour, there wasn't much left on the okra. i used the suggestion from one of the reviews and used milk, then did half and half flour and meal. little skeptical because the in laws were having dinner with us. i made a whole lot and i think we all would have eaten more had it been there.  thanks

Very good! I poured the cornmeal mixture into the okra/egg mixture and coated it so it wasn’t messy then transferred it to the hot oil. ****Made second time and only did 2/3 cup of cornmeal and it was perfect. Also I didn’t do just 10 okra. It was about 7 cups cut up to this recipe. I also add a little more salt and pepper to taste my family likes flavor.

I normally love fried okra, but with this recipe, I couldn’t taste the okra at all. It was all breading. I think I’ll try to make it again but this time using flour not cornmeal.

I added another egg and salted after I was done frying it since I couldn't taste enough flavor. Definitely a repeat.

Perfection.  This is a simple and true recipe.  I feel like the key to success is using cast iron and controlling your heat.  These cooked crisp and had very little extra pieces falling off.  Happy summer :)

Awesome!! Don’t change anything!!!!! I had a pound of okra that I had intended to pickle but got lazy.  Found this recipe and adjusted the recipe to fit the quantity of okra I had. My husband questioned my frying up so much but as soon as I was taking it out of the pan he (and I) was gobbling it down.  Good thing we didn’t have company for dinner. Thank you Linda and AllRecipes for a receipe that is a definite keeper.

This was my first time making fried okra. They came out nice and crisp. I like that it was not slimy; but I'm not sure if that was the okra or the recipe.  Incidentally, I used avocado oil, and sprinkled a little more salt on it before serving, with ranch dressing for dipping.

I used to live in the deep south for over 2 decades and came to love this side! I had been craving fried okra for some time (it's hard to find any restaurants here in Green Bay that have it) and finally just decided that I'd have to take matters into my own hands. 
I came across this nice simple recipe and gave it a go. As I do with most of the attempts I make from offerings on this site, I made it exactly to the specifications of the recipe. I found that it was just what I had been looking for! It definitely satisfied as per ordered. 
Like many here, I will make adjustments to future attempts to personalize it but, overall it is indeed "just what the doctor ordered"

This is a good basic recipe, however, I found the end flavor to be somewhat bland. As was recommended by many other reviews, I used a blend of flour and cornmeal. If I were to make this dish again, I would include cayenne pepper and more salt into the breading mix, and soak the okra in buttermilk instead of egg.

This was my first time making fried okra.  I followed the recipe exactly.  It tasted good but I think the oil was not hot enough and the okra did not stay coated with the cornmeal.  My family still liked it.  I will definitely make it again.

Pretty good.  Personally like it battered a bit better.  But this works!  Just let it cook to "golden brown and delicious" before you turn it.  Also like to cook the okra seasoned generously with onion salt, drain on paper towels, and cook a thinly sliced onion in the hot pan.  Add cooked onion on the side of the plate to go with the okra, but not mixed with it.  That helps keep the okra crisp.  Enjoy!

I absolutely dislike (Really, I do not like) Okra... with a passion; however, my friend wanted some fried okra for her party and she asked me to fry up some.  So... I used this recipe and sprinkled a little parmesan on the finished product and the folks loved it.  I mean they really loved it.

Now unless someone ask me to cook this again for a special event, this is the first and last time I am cooking okra.

Yes, I am from the south and I have fried okra for years.  I saw this recipe ant thought I would  try this one. I  very disappointed.  The problem was adding egg to the recipe.  Use all ingredients but eliminate the egg,

I love okra and this is a great recipe.  I think some of the folks on here did not soak the cut okra in egg long enough.  I find the corn meal sticks well to the okra.  Some excess comes off but what does that matter?  You don't have to eat the excess.  I use a slotted spatula to pull the cooked okra out of the pan.  The excess just falls through the slots to the pan.

I have always had trouble getting the cornmeal to stay on during cooking, but this recipe solves that problem by soaking it in an egg. It worked!!! We also loved the flavor of the okra and I plan on making this app at from now on!!

I followed some of the other's suggestions and added a bit of flour to to the breading but otherwise followed the recipe. It was definitely delicious but felt a bit under seasoned. Next time I'll add more salt.

I should have known I wouldn't like this since it was a mostly cornmeal breading... but I tried it anyways and all I taste is cornmeal.  Barely edible that's why 2 stars

I mis-read the recipe and did add a little flour plus some Cajun seasoning and skipped the salt & Pepper.  The okra was ready before I finished up the meal, so after draining it on paper towels, I put it in a glass pie plate and put it in the oven set for keep warm (170 degrees).  Perfect, my hubby said it was the best ever.  I will continue to add the flour and cajun seasoning, but skip the salt after frying....it was a little salty for me.  Thanks for the recipe, I've noted the changes I made and will make this again.  Oh I did use my sliced frozen okra.  Will also add a little milk to the egg and refrigerate it in a bag with the breading mix.  This is really, really good and I never cared much for fried Okra.

The recipe was simple and the irks turned out perfect. I had never fried okra myself so this was an awesome treat for us; being that my husband and I love it. It didn't take any time to make and was so delicious.

This is how I was taught to make okra.  The only difference was  we used bacon drippings.  (Not heart healthy but oh so delicious.) No slimy consistency.  It comes out crispy.  Wonderful!

Fixed 2 lbs  of okra from the farmers market and my husband ate half.  I didn't soak in egg but used a little milk.  Next time I'll try egg....maybe, he really liked it like this.

Deeeeee-licious!!

I haven't had fried okra since I left the south many years ago and never thought to make it myself before, but I had a craving the other night and decided to give this recipe a shot. I did make some changes and the results weren't exactly 'traditional' but I don't care. It was still REALLY good and that's what counts, right?

First, I used an egg with a bit of milk added to soak the okra in. I  didn't have any cornmeal on hand so I used some of Famous Dave's cornbread mix and some flour -- I only eyeball measurements but it was about half and half -- added some salt and pepper, then dumped the milk and okra into it. It turned into something almost like a pancake batter but it stuck well to the okra and produced a fantastic crust with lots of delicious little crispy bits. 

Hint: drop them in the oil a few at a time so you don't get big ol' clumps and let them fry for a few minutes before starting stir and flip. I think that was key to keeping the crust from falling off. I plan on making this at least once a week for the rest of my life...

These were better than my grandma made, according to my mom, which is the highest praise that is possible. Her cooking is the standard to which we hold all others. She's been dead for 15 years now, but her meals are still remembered fondly. I made it exactly as the recipe said, with okra from a friends garden. In the south, there is always okra laying around in the summer. I will be making this for years to come.

I used frozen bagged okra. I did a 50/50 mix of flour and corn meal, which I seasoned with garlic powder, onion powder, and season salt.  I soaked the okra partially thawed in a mixture of milk and egg for 20 minutes prior to frying. I also fried my okra in my deep fryer versus stove top. It turned out nice and crunchy.

Mixed a splash of milk in with the egg and substituted 1/4 cup of flour for 1/4 cup of the cornmeal. Used about 16 okra pods and had ample amount of egg mixture as well as the flour mixture to coat the additional pods. Fried up nicely considering I haven't fried anything in oil for at least 20 years. Easy side dish that everyone enjoyed.

Next time I make this I'll do 1/2 flour and 1/2 corn meal. All corn meal was a bit much. The flavor was okay otherwise though. Could use more of a kick, maybe some cajun seasoning instead of just salt and pepper

I used half cornmeal, half hazelnut flour to get a gluten-free version. I believe the hazelnut flour burns too easily, so next time I will try just cornmeal as a comparison. Also, I cooked this in about a quarter inch of avocado oil in a cast iron skillet, so perhaps it works better in a dunk fryer?

I didn't have cornmeal so I had to substitute with what I had which was matzo meal - I thought it was pretty good but I have to admit I prefer fresh okra!  I thought this needed a bit more flavor and I would prob add a bit of parm cheese to the cornmeal/matzo meal next time.

I just picked my first yield of okra out of my garden (got a huge bowl full!) yeehaw! It's absolutely my favorite vegetable and although we generally do not eat fried foods,for this delight we make an exception. I had about twice as much okra so doubled the dry mix. The only thing I changed was to add a little flour and garlic powder(bout a tsp.) to the dry coating. Then I fried it in my GE deep fryer. It turned out perfect! My husband will love it when he gets here! (he grew it) ;)

The cornmeal stuck to the okra very well... I let it sit for at least 10 minutes.  It was a bit gritty for me, so next time I will mix half cornmeal and half flour.

This was okay.  I mixed some flour mixed in with the cornmeal and added salt and pepper after frying to boost the flavor.

Pretty good...My cornmeal didn't stick so well while frying.  Perhaps soaking okra in egg closer to 10 min would do the trick.  My kids liked it, so it must be a keeper!

very good! I never had fried okra before so this was a great experience. My husband wanted to have some when he got back on a vacation, where he ate fried okra all the time. So this will be a great addition to are sides for dinner.

I opted to used a cajun fish seasoning mix to cover the okra- it gave the okra a wonderful spicy kick :)

I rated this 4 stars because it was just okay. I followed the instructions and other reviewers by using pre-mixed cornmeal, four, & salt mixture. The okra tended to stick together in clumps. I think next time I will stick to cooking the pre-breaded frozen okra.

I left out the salt, and fried the okra in my deep fryer on 360 degrees.  Tastes just like I would get in a restaurant.  I loved it, and will make again.  Thanks for the recipe.

Not a favorite in my house.  I used frozen okra (thawed), only because the okra in the produce section looked terrible.  Mixed 1/2 cornmeal and 1/2 flour and the texture was still too gritty for me.  Also added garlic powder and cayenne pepper but it just wasn't enough for us.

I love fried okra, but coating it in cornmeal made it so gritty and crunchy I couldn't eat it plain.  I had to put a sauce (ketsup) on it just so I could swallow it.  Next time I'm going to use corn flour and hope that does the trick.

This turned out great!
I decided after reading the reviews to use Jiffy cornbread mix instead of the cornmeal and I put 1/2 cup milk with the eggs. I also added 1/2 tsp of Garlic powder and 1/2 tsp of Cayenne pepper. It wasn't to spicy with the Cayenne it may have needed a little more. I couldn't tell it was in there.
Even the kids ate it and that surprised me. We will definitely make this one again.

I'm from the south & love fried okra, but this was really disappointing.  Too bland & not nearly crunchy enough.  Not much better, in my opinion, than the soggy stuff we used to get at Luby's.

I really enjoyed this recipe! I had no troubles at all with that batter falling off. The only changes I made were using half flour, half cornmeal and thawed frozen okra. I have always loved fried okra but there are so few places that serve it - no one I know likes it so I figured that like spinach (something else no one likes yet I do) okra was in that category. Now I can have fried okra whenever I want! Thanks!

This batter all fell off. Possibly if the batter stuck on it would be ok. Plain okra (formerly battered) was ok.
