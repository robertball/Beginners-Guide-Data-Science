I have made this many many times... I like it a little better with less coco (I like milk choc more than dark choc), but either way everyone that tries it says it tastes just like the kind you have to stand and stir over the stove! 

I've put pecans in some batches and love it. The trick to getting it to set right is to make sure the milk and butter get HOT. Also, it helps if you sift your sugar together with the coco so it is already mixed for the most part (I have even heated the milk and butter in the microwave, then mixed in with the sugar and coco - then added the vanilla last). Make sure you stir REALLY fast and pour before it gets cool... that way it leaves a nice shiny top - if you stir after it cools it looks a little lumpy on top.

I also line my pan with foil so it is easy to lift out and cut into squares.

This is an excellent recipe for fast, yummy fudge.  I recommend microwaving the butter and milk separately, stirring the powdered sugar and cocoa together for 3 minutes(to avoid lumps), then quickly beating in liquid with a mixer for best results. I made this fudge and it was lump-free, I'm making more this afternoon!

This was my stand by for years - it was in the old Betty Crocker Christmas Cookbook, but cooked on the stove top.  I am so glad to have found it and extra happy it has been made so simple in the microwave!  I just made 4 pounds for my church's Christmas bazaar, and it all went - and they sold it by the piece!!  Once again my mailman will be happy at Christmas with his tin of fudge!

This may not be gormet but it is suprizingly creamy and delicious!  After making this fudge a few times I learned to sift the sugar and cocoa to avoid lumps. It is also tough to get out of the pan... so if you line the pan with tin foil you can take the whole thing out onto a cutting board and just peel the tin foil off then cut it into squares.  I also recomend storing what's left in the fridge.  It's also fun to mix in baking candies. This is the only fudge recipe I'll ever be making! :-)

I was looking for a good fudge recipe that didn't have marshmallow cream and wasn't a lot of work.  I came across this recipe, tried it and loved it!  I microwaved it for 2.5 mintues, and then use an electric beater on high speed for just a minute to mix in the vanilla and smooth out the consistency, then I pour it in the pan.  I've also added peppermint extract instead of the vanilla, and drizzled the top with melted mint chocolate chips.

I had such a craving for chocolate and this was so easy! I made it quicker than it would have taken me to go to the store for a treat. I used regular margarine and heavy whipping cream since that was all I had and it still came out great. I put chopped walnuts on top to cut the sweetness. Yummy!

I have been using this recipe for years. A few said it came out a little too soupy and cuts up thin. I have made a few changes and it comes out great. I cut the stick of butter or stick margarine at the 6 Tablespoon mark and I add 2 Tablespoons of cocoa to the 1/2 half cup. So a little more powder and a little less butter and I use a buttered loaf pan instead of the 8 x 8 pan so get thick pieces of fudge. I get all ingredients ready and put the milk and butter in the microwave 2 minutes, then quickly add the 4 cups of powdered sugar (which is the same as a one 1 lb box), the cocoa and vanilla. Stir well. Once it has all been stirred well, I sometimes add 1/2 cup of chopped nuts or swirl a few heaping tablespoons of peanut butter in (don't mix the peanut butter into the fudge, just swirl a bit so it is evenly distributed). Refrigerate until firm enough to cut. I use a thick knife to deeply cut down into the fudge & cut longways in half, then half again, then across into squares. Dig one corner out first, etc.

Exactly as advertised...a good recipe for a chocolate or sugar fix.  It did take a bit longer to set up than 10 minutes, though.  I left it in the freezer for about 30 minutes.

This was a really simple and tasty recipe.  I made it twice, and the second time turned out wonderful.  It was probably because I used margarine the first time and unsalted butter the second time.  I made it in my dorm and everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.  I didn't have a hard time getting it set at all.

Such disappointment. I don't know what happened. I was making this for my Christmas spread and it never firmed up. It was one chocolate gelatinous mess. Tasted decent but I could never serve it to anyone. Now I have to make something else for my candy tray. Big bummer.

This is good if you need something sweet fast- it took a little longer than 10 minutes, but tasted wonderful, like traditional fudge to me! Not too gooey or too sugary if you do it right.  The kids loved it because they could help make it. Hope this helps!

It is honestly not like traditional fudge in taste or texture, but it is tasty nonetheless and certainly worth the effort.  For those who want something sweet in a pinch this works well.

Wow!  Amazing that you can make fudge that quickly and easily and have it turn out so good.

I veganized this for my boys who have severe food allergies, using dairy-free margarine and rice milk.  The only thing missing was a little salt, but that was my fault since the margarine is unsalted.

I followed others recommendations to melt the "butter" and "milk" together first in the microwave.  I used a whisk to mix the cocoa and sugar, and remove lumps.  Then I added the milk mixture to the dry mixture, and continued to stir with the whisk.  I added the vanilla, and continued mixing with a rubber spatula. 

It came out so smooth!  I didn't grease the pan but used foil instead, as others suggested, which made cutting easy.  

Thank you for this recipe!!  I will definitely make it again . . .  And again . . .  And whenever I need a quick chocolate fix. :)

Although I had no trouble getting this to set up (work fast, because it sets up very quickly,) I did not care for the final result. The powdered sugar contributed a strange texture, and it was not at all creamy like a traditional cooked fudge. It tasted like powdered sugar and cocoa. Yuck. I feel it to be much better to expend the time and energy to make the real thing than to save some time with this ersatz stuff, and will obviously never make it again.

I was surprised at how good this is!  I doubt I'll be making fudge on the stovetop anytime soon.  The only problem I had was that I made it according to the directions, and ended up with little chunks of powdered sugar that I couldn't whisk out.  I believe if I had heated the butter and milk separately like lots of others did, I wouldn't have had this problem.

Excellent recipe! Smooth, creamy fudge in less than 15 minutes, with only 5 ingredients? I'm sold! I was having a major chocolate craving and started looking for a recipe based on the ingredients I had on hand. This fit the bill perfectly! Next time I get a chocolate craving I want to try this recipe with a couple of drops of mint extract like I use in my coffee.

We absolutely loved how this came out. The powdered sugar offered in bulk at the store was rather chunky, so incorporating it was difficult. It cooled fast and was hard to stir; microwaving it again made it easier to stir and didn't harm it in the slightest. The product is still being savored!

Oh wow! Wish I had found this recipe sooner---I cannot count how many times I've stood over the stove making complicated fudge trying to "gage" soft candy temp and/or is it over-boiling/under-boiling only to end up with "ice cream topping." This recipe is "too easy" I thought. IT'S GORGEOUS!!!! It taste just like the "complicated" fudge (or close enough for me anyway) without any of the hassle! Yummmmmmy!

I have to tell you, i was very skeptical about this recipe. I have tried many quick fudge recipes over the years and they were either horrible or were no where near as good as my family recipe. This is surprisingly very good quick fudge. I recommend any one give it a try and see for yourself. The next time i make it i will add nuts and maybe a half a teaspoon of butter extract. Thank you for this recipe.

My family loves this fudge recipe! I make it with my 3 and 6 year olds and they are amazed that we can "make candy in our cooker" (thats what they call the microwave, lol.) This recipe is simple, quick, and tasty. True, this is probably not a gourmet fudge recipe, but for ease, texture, overall taste, and finished product, it definitely deserves 5 stars! This is also a great starter recipe to add in your own favorite nuts, chips, etc., but my family prefers it plain. We actually plan on making a batch for our Thanksgiving dessert table this year! Thanks for the great recipe!

Could not be easier.  It tastes as good as any fudge I have ever had.  It is a little bit softer, but I like it that way.  Make sure that you stir really well though.

uh im pretty sure 2 minutes isnt enough. i did read the reviews well the first few one said to make sure its hot. but when i put the stuff in the pan thing after it was in the microwave.. i tried it before puting it in the freezer and the sugar is way crunchy i dont think it even melted enough. oops. maybe the recipe should specify that it should melt the sugar cause im not really making fudge all the time that would have helped! it was hot just not melted.

I used margarine instead of butter since I didn't have any butter and I forgot the vanilla before it was too late. I would add the vanilla before you start stirring or even with the milk. It is really sweet but thats expected given the sugar content. I would suggest adding nuts or something and it would offset the sweetness. I made it all in my silicone pan including microwaving it and it definitely hits the spot, I am wishing I tried it with peanut butter... I did experience the clumps of icing sugar, definitely sifting next time.

This is a good recipe. I think I measured something wrong cause it was still very powdery after microwaving... my point of putting this review up is that I added more milk and then it mixed and set up good. So if yours is still too powdery to mix, try adding some milk... worked great for me and it tasted real good!

I was surprised this worked so well in the microwave. I really like the chocolate flavor. I quartered the recipe and microwaved it for about 70 seconds, and I lined the pan with foil so I could remove it easier.

Quick and easy, but tasted too much like sugar. Didn't set in 10 minutes, took more like 1/2 hour.

I made this exactly by the recipe except for cutting it in half (just to see if I liked it) and for sifting the sugar and cocoa (my sugar was a bit lumpy). I have never been able to do the soft/hard ball thing in a cup of water, so I've been relegated to the marshmallow cream recipe. I saw this one and thought I'd try it. It is dangerously easy and delicious tasting!

I have been using this recipe since the early 90's and was so happy to find it here.  This is by far the quickest and easiest way to make fudge.  Anyone that this had a problem with this has tried to do it on a stove top or didn't follow the directions properly. I've found that for a creamier fudge, you can use 3 oz. of whipping cream (Cream being heavier and thicker than milk, you need a little extra).  Also, if you prefer darker fudge, you can use the Special Dark cocoa from Hershey's.  I've also made peanut butter fudge using this same recipe.  Just leave out the cocoa and use peanut butter instead of butter.  Another quick and great treat.  I saw this recipe on a microwave cooking show on PBS.  They actually listed several variations, I just can't recall all of them.  One more small hint here.  Modern day microwave a far hotter than earlier models.  Melt time for bitter in my microwave is just over 1 min.  This is important, you don't want to over heat the mixture as it can become very hard very fast.  So do a test run to determine how long it takes to melt your butter and go from there.  Happy cooking and enjoy!

I have made this for years except for a 13 by 9 dish. 2 lb powdered sugar,  1 cup cocoa 1 cup butter and 1 tablespoon vanilla.  Nuts optional.  I chill it at least one hour.  Always a hit!

So easy, quick and good it's ridiculous. I used the reviewer's suggestion of warming the butter and milk together in the microwave and then adding it to the dry ingredients. Just make sure you use a bowl big enough that the milk doesn't boil over! I used peppermint extract instead of vanilla. Yum.

Excellent!! This fudge turned out perfectly wonderful. I excluded the vanilla and replaced it with mint extract and sprinkled little green sprinkles on top. The sprinkles added a perfect touch to the mint chocolate. I'm saving this in my inbox.

Super easy, fantastic taste! Reminds me of the fudge I made with my grandmother. We spent half an hour beating that fudge by hand, after cooking it. This is similar fudge in just a few minutes.

This was really good and easy. I really didn't have any trouble with getting it to set, it was very thick to begin with. I did follow the suggestions in the comments and microwaved the milk and butter separately.

Very good! My only problem is that for the best results you should make sure there are no lumps in the sugar and cocoa. Other than that, this was a good recipe that I will use again.

I made this fudge yesterday. I followed directions exactly. I did use an electric mixer to mix it all together at the end. However, I let it freeze a little bit longer. It tasted great, but was a little lumpy. Guess next time i'll have to sift the ingredients together.

I used to have a recipe for microwave fudge back in the 1980s and then lost it. I found it again on this website and it's every bit as good as I remember. My kids loved this fudge; it's fast, easy, you always have the ingredients on hand, and it's delicious. Thanks so much!

Decent recipe. I made one batch exactly the way the recipe stated. It tasted okay, but the fudge was hard to cut, a little lumpy, and crumbly.  I made the second batch with the suggestions of others. I sifted the flour and cocoa together in one bowl, and melted the milk and butter together in another. I then poured the milk/butter and vanilla into the bowl with the dry ingredients and mixed. This fudge came out much creamier than the first batch.  The only complaint I have is that the fudge does not come out very thick. I used an 8x8 pan and the fudge wasn't even 1/2" high. The batter was also very hard to pour and spread - I suspect the recipe needs some more liquid ingredients.  The fudge is good, but it defintely doesn't taste like real chocolate fudge. Good for just a sweet bite though!

I really like no-fail fudge recipes like this this one. Especially when it turns out! This came together so fast I was shocked that the end result was so good! It was very chocolaty and really sweet - which means a little piece goes a long way! It was surprisingly creamy and set up perfectly. I did line my pan before pouring the fudge in for easier removal. I will definitely make this again and even try experimenting with different flavours of extract - like orange or raspberry. Thanks for sharing!

So easy and so delicious.  For easier cleanup, I line the pan with aluminum foil, and when the fudge hardens it peels right off.

I had tried "cocoa fudge" at a fair last year and it was delicious.  I was hoping this would be the same recipe, but something was missing.  It looked the same, and had the same melt-in-your-mouth texture, but I did not find it to be chocolatey enough...maybe I'll try adding more cocoa next time.  Still, it was easy and pretty good.  Set up fine for me after about 10 minutes in the refigerator (did not freeze - no room in freezer!)

I was out of milk, so I used evaporated instead, also, I only used half the vanilla.  It turned out excellent.  Next time I will sift the cocoa and sugar though. ** I made this a 2nd time, except I used peppermint extract instead of vanilla.  It tasted like girl scout cookies without the cookie. =)

Fantastic, and very easy!  When microwaving, ignore the time and just microwave until the butter is melted.  I added way more vanilla than the recipe called for (helps to cover the confectioners' sugar taste).  My only trouble is, I end up with little clumps (even after sifting the ingredients to start with) after cooking, so I have to QUICKLY mash it through a mesh strainer.

This didn't work out for me.  Had the consistancy of silly putty.  Tastes okay, but you can't eat it unless you're going to put it in a bowl.  Try it, it might work for others(it obviously has) but it just didn't work out for me.

You absolutely can't go wrong w/this fudge! Too thick? Add more milk. Too thin? Add more sugar! So very simple and foolproof. It's our 'go to' fudge for any occasion!

I really needed a nice, quick recipe for fudge to satisfy my late-night sugar craving and this was just what I was looking for! It was super easy to make and I had it in the freezer in under ten minutes! It took a bit longer to set than the recipe said but it was worth it anyhow!

Excellent! If you need something quick and easy this is it. I have made this recipe for over 8 years, and sometimes ADD PECANS. Everyone loves it, especially the men. It's great to give as a gift.

This is a very good quick fudge recipe.  I have made it many times and it always turns out great.  Sometimes I even add a handful of mini marshmallows.

Pretty darn good for something just thrown together. It was super easy & fast to make & really gooey. I adjusted it to use slightly less powedered sugar & the same amount of cocoa ( about 2 cups) I wanted a darker chocolate taste. I also added 2 TBLSPs peanut butter to thicken it up a bit. Outstanding! Super rich!

I doubled the recipe so I wouldn't have to measure the powdered sugar.  Used 1/2 c. peanut butter and 1/2 c. butter.  Next time I think I will add a bit more cocoa - not quite chocolatey enough!

This was quick and easy.  I had some difficulty getting my powdered sugar to mix in before everything started to harden.  Some of the problem may have been because my kitchen was really cold, dunno for sure.  Anyway, there were a few pieces that had little chunks of powdered sugar so I just discarded them.  Might try this again.

Are you KIDDING me?!?! I've been slaving over boiling pots of sugar, butter and cocoa for 32 years - struggling to get that temperature perfect - just right to form a soft ball. Despite my efforts, having a sucessful batch was still a gamble. NOW you tell me that I could have just microwaved some butter and milk and stirred it into confectioners sugar?!?! ARRRGH! Well, as others have suggested, I sifted the sugar and cocoa. I also microwaved ONLY the butter and milk. After stirring it all together, I pour the mixture in a glass baking dish coated with real butter. (When your tounge touches the fudge, you get a nice buttery surprise for a moment. Woohoo!) I've made this several times. I've made it without nuts, with nuts, and I've made maple-walnut fudge. With all of the flavorings and food colorings available nowadays, you can get REALLY creative with this basic recipe! You could do ALL SORTS of variations for the holidays!! Have fun!

This was so good for being microwaveable. It did taste just a little like powdered sugar but was good anyway. I used a mixer to beat it after microwaving, instead of stirring, and it didn't turn out lumpy. It was creamy. It's really fast to make and it's worth it. I thought it was just the right taste, as in not too bitter and not too sweet.

It made a good sugar fix and set up fine. It was pretty lumpy though. I would not substitute this for the original stuff.

I also had lots of clumps. I followed the recipe exactly but after 15 min in the freezer it had not set. I then put it in the refrigerator for a while and still very little. I think I'll stick to making fudge the old fashioned way.

Not sure how to rate this one. Worked for me except for a few clumps that I couldn't get rid of. Way too sweet for my taste buds. Next time will add nuts. This will make a wonderful layer on a cake or mint brownie. As a fudge, I will play around with it.

SUPER SIMPLE AND TASTY!!
I actually changed the servings number to 3, to reflect the fact that i was making fudge for me, and not a party or family. I admit, making fudge in the microwave is scary. I've made fudge many times before, always on the stove, stirring and slaving away for delicious perfect or slightly imperfect fudge. this is my first microwave attempt and it turned out perfectly. 
I lacked vanilla, and that was a minor problem, but otherwise, still perfect! Great Recipe!!

Second Time in as Many days, Still fabulous!

I have tried a few microwave fudge recipes and I like this one the best - it was creamy and smooth and very easy to prepare. I had trouble with lumps from when the butter melted and boiled next to the icing sugar while the rest of the butter was still melting. So next time I may try melting the butter and milk first and sifting in the cocoa and icing sugar.

Very good for such an easy recipe.  I couldn't get my lumps out and it was a bit off-putting for some people (my brother was convinced it was nuts).  I even used an electric mixer and didn't get the lumps out.  HOWEVER, it does melt in your mouth, though it is not a "creamy" fudge ... but a very good one nonetheless! Thank for for this QUICK alternative with things I always have in my cupboard!

Awesome, for what it took to make it!!! I was very excited to find this recipe, since I don't have a candy thermometer, or a heavy cooking pot. This was perfect for me! My arms gave out before the tiny lumps of confectioner's sugar did, but oh well! It was very yummy!

It is as it's described. Satisfies a sweet chocolate craving. Not the best fudge I've had, but definitely the fastest and easiest and satisfied my bordem and sweet-tooth. I would call it chocolate icing rather than fudge, infact I'll use this recipe as a fast icing next time. Thanks for sharing.

This fudge was GREAT and SO EASY!  Mine didn't firm up quite as quickly as the recipe says, but so what?  It's even better with a 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts stirred in with the vanilla- that way you can't taste any icing sugar lumps.

Makes me soooooo mad!  I KNEW this could not possibly set up.  There is too much liquid (melted butter and milk) for this amount of confectioners sugar.  But I made it anyway!  wasted ingedients and nuts!   NUTS!!!!

very easy and nice.   Set well. perhaps a little too sweet though.  be very careful to get all the little lumps out or else there are white clumps of sugar which are not pretty or tasty.

Very yummy! Wasn't nessesary to grease the pan- I think somebody mentioned that already, and it was kind of hard to beat it smooth. But it was fast to make and everybody liked it.

It's an easy recipe and the texture is good, but I didn't particularly care for the flavor.  I prefer a more milk chocolate fudge.

I was very surprised that this came out the correct consistency, considering how easy it was! It WAS a tiny bit on the grainy side but it wasn't too grainy. Also, I followed another reviewer's advice and didn't cook it 2 minutes, I watched the butter and stopped the microwave when the butter was melted. I also SIFTED together the sugar and cocoa and added a few mini marshmallows on top of the whole mixture before heating. I made only a half-batch to see how it would turn out and now I wish I had made the entire thing! My husband gives the taste only 3 stars but I give the recipe 4 stars because of the simplicity! I used foil to line my pan and it made clean-up even easier!

This fudge is really easy and good and for a change of taste you can add almond extract instead of vanilla to give it a cherry fudge taste.

This recipe is wonderful!  I've made it several times and have even cut it in half and in 4.  I do NOT TIME it in the microwave, I WATCH it to see when the butter is melted.  When I want to make it a little more like CREAMY milk chocolate, I add a little marshmallow creme.  I can't believe how simple it is!

This recipe reminds my husband of his mother's fudge, even though hers was cooked on the stove.  He likes the firm texture and I had no problems with mine setting up. This is the easiest fudge recipe ever.

My 2 1/2 year old daughter and I whipped this up in 5 minutes.  Very quick and easy.  It's not exactly gourmet, but it's a very good fudge especially considering the time and effort.  And I love not having to stand next to the stove and stir, stir, stir!

Made fudge per the recipe.  It was so easy and tasted just like the hard-to-make old fashioned stove top method fudge.  Will definitely save this recipe.

I made it exactly as written and saw that there was not enough milk and butter for that amount of powdered sugar and cocoa. I quickly heated up another 1/4 cup milk and 3tsp more butter together and it worked. BUT it got so hard so quickly. Good thing I buttered the plate. I spread it out  quickly. Taste good but I'm not trying this again. I found a more accurate easier recipe with similar ingredients.

I got this recipe from a friend a couple of years ago. She's been making it for years for her husband's employees at Christmas. They also host a huge BBQ every July, and practically the first thing everybody asks her is if she's gonna make the fudge again for Christmas LOL!!! 

As many others here mentioned.....it's almost impossible to screw this up. (Not sure why some here had problems with it setting up. IT IS a softer fudge, but I've never had any probs with it becoming firm enough to cut and hold in your hand.) Anyway....I do it the same way my friend does it and double the recipe, then simply divide it up into fairly equal portions after completely mixed and press into sprayed plastic containers with tight fitting lids. Then we just cut out whatever size piece we are in the mood for at the time. One other thing that I do is to use plastic gloves and mix it by hand being careful not to stick my fingers directly into the hot butter until it's combined with the dry ingredients. Also.....we use 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream and 1 cup nuts. I gave this to another friend as a Christmas gift this year and she told me later: THIS FUDGE OUGHT TO BE ILLEGAL!!! LOL

I warmed my ingredients in a pan on the stove. Used a spatula spoon to stir in the powdered sugar. My son is allergic to dairy so I used vegan butter & coconut milk. Smooth out any lumps with the spatula. Firmed up nicely.

I've made this recipe many times over the last 5 years, and I'm coming back to review it because I just tried a different recipe, and it was just not as good. I made the microwave fudge recipe that uses sweetened condensed milk, chocolate chips, and butter. It's fine, but not anywhere near as amazing as this recipe. The flavor and texture of this recipe is, in my opinion, some of the best fudge I've ever had. I've had no reason to attempt more difficult fudge recipes, because I'm so happy with this one.

Yummy and easy. Heat the butter/milk separately (watch so it doesn't bubble over), add to the whisked sugar/cocoa and use a handheld mixer to beat (not too high or you'll get bubbles). When I tried as written I got lumps-yuck.

i am a person who has trouble getting fudge to set but this worked just great; tasted good, didn't take many ingredients.  I swirled PB in mine like one of the other reviewers here suggested and i was pleased.  I think mine had to set in freezer for 30 minutes, but like i said, consistency totally fine.

Worked perfectly. Its a softer fudge than im normally used to but its actually better. I added in some mixed nuts in the final stirring stage and it came out amazing. Thanks for sharing :)

I have been looking for a quick and easy microwave fudge recipe for weeks.  I decided on this one this morning.  I did make a few changes.  I sifted the cocoa and powdered sugar to avoid lumps.  I am lactose intolerant so I used Lactaid instead of whole milk and I cut the butter back by 1T and replaced it with 1T of peanut butter.  It did take 30 mins to set properly in freezer but once it was ready, it was amazing!  LOVE it!

This tastes very nice, but it did not set in ten minutes for me. So far, it's been two hours and twenty minutes, and it's still more like pudding than fudge.

I did exactly as directed, but it never hardened up. It's one big gooey mess. I'm gonna try to reheat it on the stove and cook it longer to see if I can salvage it....

My husband's favorite fudge and super simple.  I've never really had any trouble with it setting up.  I do use a mixer to mix it after it comes out of the microwave so maybe that helps.

I love this recipe. I didn't have any problems making it. I think the microwave time depends on the wattage of your microwave, mine is small and I had to cook it a little longer. It also took a little longer to firm up for me. I sometimes add walnuts to mine at the end. In the end the taste was delicious. I sprayed the pan and it was easy to get out.

It turned out great  and my family loved it which then made me love it even more. This was a dessert tested for a church small group and I was in charge of dessert. The only thing I did differently is that after I had decided it would be time to mix the ingredients I heated it up and froze it until the small group began which was about 3-3 1/2 hours.

This was so easy to make and very good. I divided the recipe by 4 for a smaller batch which was a bad idea. The smaller batch was a little lumpy and had a poor texture. Also it took a little longer to cool for me but that isn't much of an issue.

I cut down on the cocoa, also, because 1/2 cup makes the fudge a little more bitter than sweet.  Also, use real butter in sticks (not in tubs)... not softened butter or butter substitutes.  If you use margarine or butter substitutes, the fudge will be too soft.  But keep in the fridge, even if you use real butter.

I didn't think that microwave fudge would be very good, but boy was I surprised.  It is actually pretty good fudge for very little effort.  What more could you ask for.  I followed the recipe, but did come out with a few lumps.  I think next time I will try other reviewers suggetions and melt the butter and mix with the milk before putting into the dry mixture.  

This one is a keeper.  Fits the bill for something sweet in a hurry.

I just made this fudge this morning. All I can say is YUM!!!! I added 2 extra tablespoons of cocoa because I read the ratings that it tasted too much like powdered sugar. I also mixed in pecans and then sprinkled coconut flakes over the top before i set it in the freezer. It did take longer than 10 minutes to set, but it still is with the time it saves not having to be over the stove for an hour turning "old fashioned" fudge. This recipe is as delicious as it is easy!! Enjoy!!

I was hopeful after reading so many positive reviews, but sadly this did NOT taste like fudge. It wasn't even that chocolatey. It pretty much just tasted like powdered sugar.

I gave this a 4 star because it is VERY VERY GOOD. It has been an hour and it is still Really soft, it tastes like brownie dough. I added walnuts to it as well. Hopefully it will set up overnight. Also it is VERY thin. You may want to make a double or even a triple batch to be thick like fudge.

Ok December 17th 2009 

Made it again and it was perfect!!!! I did add a little bit more Powdered sugar and siffted it and the cocoa. It was great

My entire household is now addicted to this fudge. I actually have guests who will bring me confectioners' sugar simply so I make this for them...lol. So incredibly easy and fast. I'll definitely be making this for the holidays. Like others, I stirred the sugar and cocoa until combined, melted the butter and heated the milk separately, then quickly stirred all together, making sure it was all smooth. It comes out in a nice neat ball. Thanks!

This is the easiest and fastest fudge recipe I have ever seen. I made this first time today and feel in love with it. I am surprised by the complaints some people have with this recipe. I followed the recipe as is and the fudge came out perfect. I heated the milk and butter separately and then mixed in to the cocoa mixture. Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

I have been searching for this recipe for some time now.  It is similar to the one my mother made on the stove when I was little.  It is very rich and you do not need to eat much to satisfy a chocolate crave.  I used Hershey's unsweetened cocoa and Domino's confectioner's sugar.  After reading reviews, I felt it was important to sift.   Because I don't own a sifter, I used a large strainer and a spoon.  It turned out WONDERFUL!  Thank you WHATCITY for sharing and bringing back memories!

My fudge turned out very creamy, but quite lumpy and the chocolate taste was a bit too rich/bitter. If I try this again I will use a bit less cocoa and try sifting the sugar/cocoa mix before adding the milk and butter. I think it could be great for a quick dessert with a bit of tweaking. Thanks for the recipe!

This was so easy to make and ready in a pinch; I had a birthday party to go to and forgot to get a gift, so at the last moment I made this and wrapped it in a gift bag - it was a hit!

This was absolutely dead easy to make! It set right up and was so quick. My only complaint is that I have tasted better fudge. Still good enough to give away as gifts, but could be better. I'll still make it though because it is so easy and saves so much time!

This was wonderfully easy to put together-brilliant for satisfying a chocolate craving without having to run out to the shops!  I would recommend using the best cocoa powder you can find, because it will really improve the flavor!  Thank you so much for this cheap and easy recipe!

Really delicious, especially for being ready in such a short time. This fudge is really rich and so my friends had a hard time eating a lot of it - which meant more for me!

This was very okay fudge.I had the hankering for something chocolate and this seemed easy enough. though it isn't as firm as fudge and I did come across a lot of sugar lumps, it did satisfy me and I'm sure  I will find a use for this recipe some day.

I grew up with this recipe, and I've always loved it.  It's so easy to make, kids can definitely play a big part in it.  I add 1 cup of creamy peanut butter to the recipe, it's delicious!!

This was soooo easy and YUMMY! I used a pie pan and lined it with foil that I sprayed with cooking spray. It sets up really fast so you have to stir it fast to get the lumps out. I will make again.

Very good.  It set up fine for me.  It's a soft fudge, and it's not the very best fudge I've ever had, but good and very easy to make!  I added pecans.

I would have given this recipe 10 stars, easy, fantastic taste and forgiving even when the cook (me) measures incorrectly. Definately a keeper.

Great and easy fudge! I did the milk and butter in the microwave by themselves and sifted the powdered sugar and cocoa powder together separately. You do have to work quickly so have your pan lined with foil before you start that way you don't have to stop to do it. I put it in the freezer overnight and tasted fantastic! We'll definitely be making it again in our house.

VERY easy to make and came out great.  (I liked it the best the next day after it sat at room temp in the plastic zip baggie.)  Thanks.  I will make definitely this again.
