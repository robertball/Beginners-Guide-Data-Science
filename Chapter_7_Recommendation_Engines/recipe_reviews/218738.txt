I have made this dip many times, but in my recipe I add a dry packet of italian dressing mix.  I would omit the garlic salt and pepper.  Always a hit!

Very unique recipe!! You better love olives if you make this; it is very 'briney' (obviously), but tasty. I think I'd skip the cheese next time... it didn't do a whole lot for me in there. Very different, which I always appreciate. Thanks! :)

I was looking for a recipe to use up some cheese and found this one.  I had all of the ingredients so I thought I'd give it a try.  Really liked it. I used red onion, but other than that made it exactly as written. Will make again, for sure

Wasn't our favorite, but if you are a salty olive-lover, it might be right up your alley.  Rinsing the olives might make it more enjoyable for us who aren't as jazzed about that flavor.
