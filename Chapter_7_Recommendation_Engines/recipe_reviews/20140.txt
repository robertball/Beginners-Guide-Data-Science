This is for the pancakes only. I used buttermilk and cut back the cinnamon to a tsp. because I served it with Absolute Best Pancake Syrup, also from this site. I'm one of those that kept the corn syrup in and kept the baking powder at it's original four tbsp. I made the batter last night and cooked it on my griddle this morning. I had no problems. It spread nicely and cooked evenly. My whole family loved these pancakes, especially with the syrup. The pancakes cooked up incredibly fluffy. I was pleasantly surprized. It really does taste like a cinnamon roll. This recipe's a keeper. EDITED REVIEW: I "sift" the ingredients together with a wisk before adding all the wet, which I've also whisked all together in a smaller bowl. This prevents overmixing. If you make this the night before, like I do, let it sit out a bit before you spoon it on the griddle. This made nine large pancakes. NOTE: Adding chopped crisp bacon to this was a genius idea. It was so good it should be illegal. We ate every single pancake.

It's very easy to make this recipe with much less sugar! Leave off the corn syrup (ugh - corn syrup) and don't prepare the topping. If the batter seems a bit thick because you left off the corn syrup, just stir in an additional tablespoon of milk. I made these cakes in this fashion and used a sugar-free syrup as a topping. It was so yummy! Thank you for a great inspirational recipe!

Per the picture, I was expecting pancakes.  But, these puffed up more than regular 'cakes and "Biscuits" is a more appropriate choice of word.  Skipped the corn syrup, used the extra TBS of milk, and GOBS more cinnamon.  The husband, who usually isn't dazzled by breakfast said, "You toss some raisins in and these would be EXACTLY like the biscuits you used to get at Hardee's".  Adding to the paper box!

Great Pancakes!  My family was praising me this morning with their mouths full (where have their manners gone?)!!!  Everyone liked them.  We too poured maple syrup over all, just like a pancake but they do have the taste of a cinnamon roll.  I added a little extra cinnamon to taste.  Otherwise, didn't change a thing! Thanks Emily!

These were just passably okay for me.  I wasn't impressed for a number of reasons. The batter, and the resulting pancakes, are thick, heavy - not nearly as light, fluffy and springy as I would have liked.  And rather than being pleasantly spiced with cinnamon, it was almost cinnamon overkill, which left a not-so-pleasant cinnamon overkill aftertaste.  I did make the powdered sugar syrup, which was actually sort of nice, but to tell you the truth, I think I'd rather have the cinnamon in IT rather than in the pancakes!  Fun to try, and probably could be tweaked to be made better (a little more melted butter and milk, a little less baking powder and cinnamon) but I wasn't thrilled enough with these to try and give it another shot.

My kids' breakfast of choice is pancakes so we are always looking for new pancake recipes.  These were a HUGE hit!  Typically, my kids each eat most or all of one plate-size pancake.  This morning, they each ate TWO each!  I asked if they were especially hungry and they replied, "No, these were just extra good!"  Per the suggestion of other reviewers, I omitted corn syrup (didn't have)and added an extra teaspoon of cinnamon.  I made the icing and was glad I did.  The kids really enjoyed the change from regular maple syrup.  Be careful though, you don't need to use much.  Try this recipe; you'll be glad you did.

Although this recipe is delicious, it's so very high in sugar!  If there was some way to alter the recipe so that one didn't get a sugar buzz (and crash) after eating it, the recipe would be a five-star.

I substituted honey for the corn syrup and added a dash of maple extract.  The pancakes tasted great, but the extra-thick batter had a tendency to burn before getting done in the middle.  Will make again, but experiment with changes to the recipe to prevent scorching.

This recipe makes for fluffy, sweet pancakes that really do taste like cinnamon rolls.  I did leave out the corn syrup (I never keep it in the house) and I used splenda rather than white sugar.  I also cut the amount of butter down to 1/8th cup.  The pancakes themselves came out beautifully.  I was about to make the topping when I realized I had no confectioners' sugar (oops!) so I just used maple syrup instead...it was still a fantastic breakfast.  Now I just have to remember to keep the confectioners' sugar around, because i can tell these will be requested often in my home. Thanks for sharing!

WOW! These definitely reminded me of eating a cinnabon! :) I am one who likes to make recipes exactly as written for my first try, then play with them on later tries. :) I made this as written today, and they are wonderful! My son agrees with me too! hehe! I also do not like to use corn syrup in recipes unless completely necessary, so next time I might play to make these a bit more healthy, since we eat them as if they are going to run away if we dont! hehe! But all in all, A DEFINITE KEEPER!! Thank you for sharing! :)

great breakfast idea! i left out the corn syrup, as it seemed an easy way to reduce the sugar a bit. i used the other reviewers suggestion and added a touch more milk. the batter was still quite thick, so i used a big spoon to pour/spread this onto the griddle. i got 11 cakes. they cooked light and fluffy at medium (350F) heat. i had some leftover cream cheese frosting, which i thinned and drizzled over top. delish!

These were yummy.  The kids loved them.  The only thing I changed was the glaze...4TB butter melted butter mixed with 2 oz cream cheese, 1/2 teas vanilla & 3/4c powdered suger.  Mmmmmm.

These are my kids' favorite pancakes.  I replace the sugar and corn syrup with 4T of agave nectar, and add a couple of Tablespoons of milk at the end to thin them out slightly.

Actually I'd give this 4.5 stars. I tossed out the corn syrup right off the bat (I'm anti HFCS and all it's cousins). I kept everything else per the recipe except used 1/2 whole wheat flour and added 2 TBSP milk to compensate for omitting the c.s. I was standing there looking at my batter and decided I was feeling lazy, so I greased a 10" cake pan, dumped it in there and baked at 350 for about 15 minutes. Flipped it out onto a plate, sliced it like a cake and served - it was excellent! Family really liked this one. Thank you for submitting!

4 stars because I did not make it as-written. I was afraid of the amounts of baking powder and cinnamon, so I cut back on both. I also didn't make them as sweet (cut out the corn syrup completely). In retrospect, they probably would have been more biscuit-like with the entire 4t baking powder, and I was honestly wanting to make pancakes.

So good! I doubled the cinnamon, added a tap of ground nutmeg and subbed honey for corn syrup. They do need to cook longer over low heat than regular pancakes. I also made them a little smaller (English muffin-sized) and the kids ate them as fast as I could cook them. The frosting was fine although it needed a lot more milk than stated. Next time, I'll try them with the cream cheese frosting recipe for Clone of a Cinnabon on this site. I froze the extra pancakes and we're going to try using them for homemade McGriddle sandwiches with sausage patties - the griddle cakes are definitely fluffy and firm enough. This recipe is about to go into heavy use at my house!

These were amazing.  My whole family gobbled them up! The only thing I did differently was instead of making the icing, I microwaved 1 cup of store-bought vanilla icing for 45 seconds to thin, and used it, mostly because I had a partial container in the fridge that I had to use up.

ok, i can't get corn syrup here in Venezuela, so I use honey. and eliminate the addicional sugar.. they are less sweet but the syrup you pour on makes them sweet... no icing, just toooo sweet. buttermilk makes them lighter it seems... you just can't make these come out bad... good eating!

These were nice - I love cinnamon in pancakes.  But it did feel like something was missing.  I didn't include the corn syrup, but I don't think it was more sugar that was missing.  It was almost like there was too much salt and baking powder - maybe that was the issue, i'm not too sure.  We ate these with homemade syrup instead of the glaze.  Thanks for the recipe Emily!

I just made the normal pancakes without the glaze and they were good. They were still pretty sweet and full of sugar, though.I may or may not make them again!

Well, I made this almost exactly like the recipe says.  I only left out the corn syrup, but otherwise exactly the same.  I was pretty underwhelmed.  It seemed basically like plain old pancakes to me.  After the first few tasting bland, I doubled the cinnamon and vanilla in the rest of the batter, but it didn't seem to matter much anyways.  I doubt I'll make these again, unless I just want quick pancakes.

Way too dry. We did not like these at all. I will give them at least 1 star for smelling good while cooking.

I thought these were okay to good. More of a 3.5 stars kind of recipe but I'll err on the generous side. Probably won't be making them with much (if any) regularity.

This pancakes are very good they cook up nice and fluffy and have a great flavor to them they remind me of French Toast Waffles from this site. I didn't make the frosting to go with it because they were good enough alone with maple syrup.

Yuuum! So good! Hubby absolutely loved these. First batch made and served with the icing, too sweet for me & I opted for syrup with mine but hubby loved the icing and ate his with that!

These are simple to make. I expected more cinnamon flavor, but my son and his girlfriend said they were fantastic and that's who I made them for, so we'll go with their rating! Thanks!

AMAZING! Best pancakes I have ever made (didn't do the glaze.) I used white whole wheat flour and subbed honey for both sugar and corn syrup. I let the batter sit in the fridge for a few minutes before cooking on my griddle. They turned out fluffy and delicious. Thanks Emily B., and thank you Tat2 for raving about this recipe on the RE. :-)

Absolutely delicious pancakes!!! These are now the favorite for my family. My kids gave me high fives and said these are the only pancakes they want from now on. My husband is away at work but is excited to return home and try these wonderful pancakes. I tried to cut the fat by using 1 cup whole wheat flour, eggbeaters, splenda, brown rice syrup and smart balance butter. Even with the modifications they were absolutely delicious. I even added 4 oz melted fat free cream cheese to the icing and only use 1 1/4 cup confectioners sugar. I will try to omit the brown rice syrup next time to cut the fat even more since other reviewers had such great results without it. This recipe is definitely a keeper. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!

I decreased the corn syrup to one tablespoon instead of two.  My only other change was that instead of using 1 1/2 cups AP flour, I used I cup AP and 1/2 cup whole wheat.  I figured that since the cinnamon would turn them brown anyway, I might as well sneak some wheat flour in there.  The cakes themselves were very good; however, that sugar sauce that goes over top was too sweet.  The pancakes were easily five stars, but the sauce ruined it.  I'm glad my boyfriend forgo the sauce in favor of maple syrup -- mine were too sweet to eat.  I'm not sure why . . . cinnamon buns have the same sauce and are usually not too sweet to eat.  And, most pancake syrups are mostly sugar anyway.  I'm not sure what went wrong here.  All I know is they were far too sweet to enjoy.  Thanks anyway.

OMGosh, these are really good! Perfect amount of cinnamon for these fluffy, tender griddle cakes.  It really did remind us of cinnamon rolls, especially with the icing .  Thanks, the family really liked them!

These are scrumptious! Here are the few changes I made: I'm a buttermilk freak (it gives flavor), so I used a cup of buttermilk and aded 1/2 teaspoon baking soda to the dry ingredients to go with it. I also reduced baking powder to 3 teaspoons. Also, as far as mixing, I just mixed the dry ingredients together and added the wet ingredients one at a time, because you don't want to overmix pancakes, so doing it that way was fine for me, AND it saved a dish. Also, since buttermilk is thicker than regular milk, I added a little milk to thin out the batter a little bit. I left in the corn syrup and left out the topping. I topped them with regular syrup. They were sooooo good.

Amazing. This was the taste of a cinnamon roll in a pancake. The most delicious pancake I have ever eaten. I used half and half instead of milk. Moist, light, fluffy, delicious.

These were really good (super sweet) and easy to make.  I made them from 1/2 cup scoops of batter and spread it out to cover my entire frying pan.  I got six HUGE pancakes from this recipe.  Surprisingly filling, 1 1/2 was enough to fill me up for dinner with a side of soup.  We liked them better when they were still a little moist inside -- flipping it when the first side was dry and leaving it for exactly 2 min to cook on the second side.

Reviewing these as I sit and eat a plate. They are very good! My husband is loving them! As per own personal preference I would leave the vanilla out of the glaze of use less. Maybe not use as much sugar in the batter. LOVE IT! Thanks

omg! first let me say that i really dislike pancakes, always have. i am the odd one out from my family who all love them! but when one of my daily emails had this recipe, something made me want to make them. so i did, for x-mas breakfast. i made them as written, although i used honey instead of corn syrup because i had forgotten to pick some up. also, since i prefer my cinnamon buns with a cream cheese icing, i cut the sugar amount in the icing in half, added a lot more milk, and added a package of cream cheese. although i still dislike traditional pancakes, i will make thiese any day. loved them! my family also loved them, and they are pancake eaters, so they should know. yes they are thicker than what i am used to seeing, and the are also fluffier, but that is why i think i liked them so much. they are thick enough you could slice them in half, put a few slices of bacon in there with a bit of the icing, and have the best griddle sandwich ever! this is going in my recipe box for sure.

I thought the pancakes were good, but I've got other recipes I like better so won't keep this one. I didn't care for the pancake/icing combination. I love the icing on cinnamon rolls but it doesn't have the same impact for me on pancakes.

We enjoyed a change from regular pancakes.  I used milk in place of the corn syrup, almost doubled the amount of cinnamon and added extra milk because the batter was so thick.  Also, we used syrup instead of making the icing.  Good though I probably won't make them again.

My husband wasn't going to eat with us the first time I made these - he isn't a huge fan of cinnamon.  He decided to try them and hasn't stopped talking about them since.  They do make too much for the 3 of us.  Also, I got this recipe from another website and their icing was 1 cup powdered sugar, 1/4 cup melted butter, 1 Tbsp maple syrup, and 1 cup milk.  I haven't tried the syrup here, but I think I'll stick to the other.

I thought these were really good and my family enjoyed them also, but I thought they were a little dry. I did leave out the corn syrup, maybe next time I will replace the corn syrup with honey. But overall, we enjoyed them and I will make them again. Also I might try adding a little cream cheese to the icing recipe!

Very tasty. I used 1 cup white flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, more cinnamon than was called for, and added raisens to some of them. Will certainly make again.

These are just ok, nothing special for me.  Extraordinarily sweet with the icing.  Even my grandchildren didn't care for them.  Can't figure out why I like cinnamon rolls, but not this. I expected to really love them.

I made these this morning for breakfast and they were a huge hit.  Recipe is easy to follow. They took a little longer to  cook than I expected but my patience was rewarded.  Lower temp yielded nicely cooked griddle cake while nicely browned on the outside.  Glaze is very sweet but that is kind of the point.  If you are looking for a different breakfast that is filing and satisfies that sweet tooth this is the one for you.

These were good, although they tasted like a regular pancake would if you didn't add the frosting on the top.  Good!

Mmmm!  I am out of white flour so I used whole wheat instead, honey instead of corn syrup and made a half batch of frosting.  Our family loved it!  And while our seven year old can usually eat 2.5 pancakes, these were more filling so she ate 1.5 instead.  Delicious!

Wonderful!!  And perfect mood-lifter for a cold gray day.  I left out the corn syrup and added the extra tbsp milk, as others suggested.  They were good but could have used just a twinge more sweetness.  Next time I will try using honey to replace the CS.  I did not make the frosting; that just seemed like too much to me.

Extremely good pancakes.  I had no trouble at all with them raising unevenly, they puffed well.  I kinda guessed on the amount of cinnamon as I was too lazy (ok, and half asleep) to dig for my Tbsp measurer, but I think I got it about right.  I made a batch and a half, but only 1 batch of the icing, and it was the perfect amount.  You don't want too much icing, it's awfully sweet.  Also, I didn't think the sugar in the cakes were overpowering either.  All in all, my kids scarfed them down and asked for me.  Oh, and they tasted excellent when washed down with a cup of coffee!

I followed the recipe as it is written except that I used soy milk instead of milk and margarine instead of butter.  We have milk allergies in the home.  The griddle cakes were great the frosting was a little too sweet.  The griddle cakes are super sweet on their own and don't really need the frosting on top.

Like many others, I added in just over a table spoon of milk instead of corn syrup and it came out perfectly. The only modification I made was the icing. When I combined the 2 cups of confectioners' sugar, 2 ts of vanilla ex., and 1 TS of milk, I did not get a liquid product. I got clumps of flour-looking dry powder still, so I decided to add 2-3 table spoons (total) of milk into the icing mixture and it turned out Perfect! I didn't serve right away when hot because I was busy making other side dishes, but when I came back to the table, the icing hardened and turned into glaze like on a donut, yum!! Thank you for sharing this recipe with us! Served best with milk!

Great fluffy and yummy pancakes! I followed the pancake recipe exactly as stated.  I did not have any powdered sugar to make the topping, so we had these with maple syrup. Thanks for sharing a fantastic recipe!

These were pretty good, not the best, but i'll make them again, could've used a little bit more cin. they were very fluffy, i replaced the corn syrup with honey also. they turned out nicely brown on both sides. very easy to cook, and def a different way to make breakfast. the syrup on the other hand wasn't cook, had to use way more milk than what was in the recipe, i even tried adding a little almond extract for flavor but i basically just taste like powdered sugar, next time im just using regular syrup. over all the actual "cakes" were pretty good.

Reading the reviews, I expected them to really taste like a cinnamon roll, but I was disappointed.  I didn't like them as much as I thought I would.  They were kind of heavy and the batter didn't really spread; it just dropped in globs.  Maybe it was my fault because I didn't use the corn syrup.  I don't think that would have made much of a difference in the lack of cinnamon roll taste, but maybe in the 'spread-ability' yes.  I won't be making these again though.  I'll just stick to my usual pancake recipe and add some cinnamon.

I really liked these!  I didnt have any corn syrup, not sure if that just makes them sweeter or if needed for texture or anything?  I made the powdered sugar glaze and had to put more milk than called for in it.  Yum!  Nice treat.  I also ate with maple syrup.  Its sweet - but I love sweet stuff.  I did a big heaping T of cinnamon - almost too much, next time I'll level it off.

They are good - just not knock-my-socks off. I admit to not making the icing, but I don't think that would up the rating (too sugary sweet). A nice change from traditional pan cakes. Love cinnamon and the flavor really comes through. Definitely worth making with the icing if you're looking for a sweet treat for breakfast but don't have the time, ingredients, or patience for cinnamon rolls!

Hello sugar rush! These really are a cross between a pancake and a cinnamon roll. These are good as a treat, but too sweet to take the place of reg pancakes. I did add the corn syrup but only about a fourth of the sugar called for and trust me, you can leave the syrup out. Once you add the glaze you would never miss it. And the glaze made the whole thing, the only complaint I have is it tastes more like a frosting for a cake then a topping on a cinnamon roll.

My husband looked up at me while eating and said, "This is so good.  I was a little worried when you told me what you were cooking.  Make these again."  That is an automatic 5 stars.  I don't use corn syrup, so omitted it.  Also used a tad less milk because I slowly add the milk when making pancakes, biscuits, etc... Sometimes you need it all for the right consistency and sometimes you don't.  Didn't make the topping, just used maple syrup.

These were fluffy and delicious.  The only thing I did differently was substitute 1/2 cup whole wheat flour for white and I left out the corn syrup.  I only made half the icing and it was still plenty.  Will be making this again!

i tried this recipe and i found it to be delicious. If using an electric griddle, cook at 350 or below. I agree with the other reviewers in adding more cinnamon. In fact,I doubled the cinnamon in my recipe and will likely triple it next time. The outcome was delicous! I also added raisins to the last batch and the raisins definitely gave it an extra punch. It's pretty easy to make and will add to my breakfast menu for variety. This is definitely a twist from typical pancakes. Mine came out more like pancakes rather than the biscuit like consistency other reviewers mentioned. *They looked like the picture and I was pleased with the result. I skipped on the icing and found it be to be tasty enough with pancake syrup. I might try the icing next time for brunch. Don't want to overload the kids with sugar on their way to school! Thanks for the recipe.

These were ok, especially with a flavored syrup (strawberry).  We didn't like the "frosting" drizzle.  Maybe would have liked it better if it hadn't been billed as tasting like a cinnamon roll - it didn't.  Good recipe for when you want something out of the ordinary.

I was hoping for a really nice cinnamon flavor and ended up with a more floury taste.  I followed the directions exactly but ended up throwing them away.

OUTSTANDING!!  I made a big batch and froze them for quick access for my 2 little boys.  So full of flavor.  I didnt make the glaze.  I just used pancake syrup.

Awesome!!! These were out of this world. They were easy to make and tasted wonderful.  I will definately make them again and I am already suggesting them to family and friends! Oh, I left out the corn syrup because I didn't have any and they still came out fine! Although next time (which will be soon) I will add the corn syrup! Thanks Emily for a great recipe!

These pancakes are great!!! very nice texture and delicious.  I've made them quite a few times.. to one batch I added a 1/2 cup of shredded granny smith apple, they were really good.  to another batch I added a 1/2 cup of mashed banana and omitted the cinnamon, these were also very good.  My kids loved them!

There was WAY too much sugar. It actually made me feel ill after i ate a few with the icing. The pancakes were fluffy, which was nice, but turned out a little dry and there was a slight bitter taste to them as well.

I followed every step and they did not turn out.  They were heavy and not much of a cinnamon taste. I will admit I can not make pancakes but I thought I would try this one.  I'll leave I-hop to make the pancakes for now on. Sorry my review was not good.

This recipe is SOOOOO GOOOD!! Me and my bf made this and we both tried it at the same time; our faces LIT UP at the same time, its so delicious. I was out of corn syrup so I used 2 T of honey instead and used 2 heaping t. of baking power so they didn't turn out like biscuits. For the icing, I used another recommendation which tastes like real cinnamon roll icing - 4 T butter, 1 t. vanilla, and 3/4  cup confect. sugar and a few drops of milk if you need it-- YUM!

My family really enjoyed these - a light, slightly crispy pancake with an interesting sauce.  They were a welcome change from traditional pancakes, tasty but not too heavy.

They turn out delicious but BEWARE THE SALT! I'm a culinary student and it drives me crazy when people add salt to a cookie or pancake recipe, and without the salt they are perfect. Also, the batter comes out very thin, making the cakes shrimpy-looking, so I advise adding another 1 1/2 to 2 cups of flour (Yes, that much!).

I only had a 1/2 cup of milk left, so I had to use "just add water" pancake mix, yuck, I know. But they actually still tasted really good. The only problem I had was my batter was too thin. I ended up adding a LOT of cinnamon. The frosting complemented them well, although it is very, very sweet. I'll definitely make these again (the right way, of course)!

I followed the recipe exactly and was very pleased!  My very picky 7 yr old had 2nds.  Contrary to some of the other comments, mine had the same consistency as Bisquick pancakes.  They were light, fluffy and a perfect pancake.  Yummy!!!

MY family absolutely LOVES these!!!  They have become part of our Christmas morning breakfast already.  

The only thing that I have changed is halving the icing drizzle.  The full amount is just too much.

Doubled the recipe (but used 2 Tbs. powder, not the full 8 tsp.) and used buttermilk.  I made them diner-sized (huge!) then froze the remaining 3 w/ wax paper in between and defrosted for 1/2 hr then re-warmed on the griddle. Easy for school morning breakfasts!

just made these for breakfast. i made a healthier version: used gluten-free flour, replaced milk w/ unsweetened coconut milk, sub white sugar & corn syrup w/ agave syrup, replaced butter w/ coconut oil & cinnamon applesauce and skipped the sugary topping and used maple syrup. AND they were delicious!

These are absolutely delicious--a perfect sweet compliment to a savory breakfast.  I didn't have any corn syrup, so I added 1 tablespoon of sugar to the batter and a few tablespoons of milk until it was the right consistency.  Everyone raved about them!

These were delicious pancakes.  The icing really made them taste like cinnamon rolls....which made the texture wrong.  If you can get over that, they were yummy.

It was good they were a little dry and had a tendency to burn. I didn't really like the frosting. Next time I think I'll add honey instead of the syrup. Also maybe some nutmeg. And try to thin the batter a little.

Was the 1 Tablespoon of Cinnamon a misprint?  I used 1 teaspoon and it was very cinnamony.  Kudos to Sarah Jo for the suggestion of whisking dry and wet ingredients in different bowls and then folding in wet ingredients.  Excellent way to not overblend.  We are fixing these for the whole family, Christmas morning!

These are good pancakes. Perfect size batter to make enough for my family of eight. I used buttermilk instead of milk, so I had to use 2 cups instead of 1 in order to make the batter thinner. Next time I will use less cinnamon (probably 2 tsp). I like the sugar & corn syrup in these, it gives them a perfect sweet taste without overpowering.

These made a great breakfast. I can't get corn syrup here and the nearest equivalent is golden syrup, which I felt would make them extremely sweet, so I left it out. I should add I did not make the glaze. My cinnamon loving daughter devoured these and her sister thought they were pretty good too. Thanks for sharing Emily.

These are very good, but I felt they could have been somewhat 'fluffier'. I followed the recipe and did not overmix, but they were a bit flat. The taste, though was awesome.

These were  not what I had really hoped they would be at all. I would say they were ok. The batter was really thick and as it say while the pancake in the pan was cooking it got thicker so I had to keep adding milk to it. These were not good at all if you didn't add the glaze. I tried it with just syrup and they were still not very good. I am just going to stick with making regular pancakes and sprinkling with cinnamon sugar.

I didn't change the recipe at all, and the dough was very thick and brown.  It was hard to tell when the pancakes were burning, so many of my pancakes got too brown.  (I wanted to make sure the middles were cooked all the way through, because the batter was so thick and they puffed up so much.)  BUT, they were very good WITH THE GLAZE.  When we added other toppings, like jam or syrup, they were just very cinnamony pancakes with jam or syrup.  But my husband's comment about the pancakes with the glaze was, "They DO taste a lot like cinnamon rolls!"  But his other comment was, "But then you might as well just make cinnamon rolls."  The family liked them, though, and I may still make them once in a while  just for fun.

These were not what I hoped they would be. There was something that didnt taste right. I did like how fluffy and moist they were but the flavor was off and the glaze was way to sweet for my taste.

Quick & easy substitute for a cinnamon roll! I made a 1/2 recipe with great results. Made this as written, except that I added an extra dash of cinnamon to the batter and about 3 oz cream cheese to the icing.  They are drier and cakier than pancakes and really need to icing to achieve that cinnamon roll flavor. YUM!

This is like the recipe that I got off Pioneer Woman's website. We also tweak it a little (try not to consume corn syrup). My family loves it. When I make the "icing" I add about 1/3 c. of syrup to it too.

I thought this was really really good.  It was quite filling though and a little went a long way.  I think it might have been because the syrup was sooo sweet.  I loved them though and will definitely make them again.

I upped the cinnamon a little and used pure maple syrup instead of corn syrup. These were AMAZING! And they really did taste like cinnamon rolls - YUM! I saw many people had problems with the batter, but I didn't. It turned out perfect.

The recipe "as is" is a 4* recipe. With some modifications, this could easily be a 5* recipe. First, we thought it needed more cinnamon. Next time I'll add at least another 1/2 Tbsp if not an entire Tbsp more. We also thought the icing tasted too strongly of powdered sugar. It didn't have any real richness to it. I think next time I will add a little cream cheese to it to give it a better flavor. Overall it was a delicious dish and I'll definitely be making it again and again.

I give this recipe 4 stars because I felt like the batter was too "thick". It wasn't thin light other batter. You had to just dump it on the skillet. Something just wasn't right about it. My girls and husband did like the frosting instead of the syrup. I will keep the frosting idea but not the batter part of the recipe.

These are just TERRIFIC!  They combine my two favorite breakfast foods: pancakes and cinnamon rolls!  They really do taste like cinnamon rolls.  The only change I made was to use honey instead of corn syrup.  I used melted real unsalted butter.  I was cooking bacon at the same time and let the batter sit a little too long and it stiffened up.  But I just added a little more milk and it was fine.  They spread out and puffed up really nice.  Next time I might try replacing some of the flour with whole wheat flour.  I ended up using about 4 Tbsp. milk for the syrup to get it to pouring consistency.  My hubby's compliment was, "Mmmmmm....now, THIS is breakfast!"

These were very good. I halved the sugar and oil and left out the corn syrup, used whole wheat flour as well. Nice cinnamon flavour.

OMG, these are good.  I made them for breakfast one morning and didn't really have time to put together the powdered sugar frosting, but they were scrum-diddly-umptious with just plain syrup.  Thanks for a terrific recipe.

I didn't have corn syrup but made all the rest as written.  Very tasty! Instead of frosting, my sons wanted theirs with Cool Whip.  They requested that these be made again! I put butter and maple syrup on mine...mmmmm good! Thanks for a great recipe!

Made it as is. I used the original topping and really liked it. Also, I used regular pancake syrup. Although the pancake syrup is probably better for you, it does lose alot of "cinnamon roll" taste. Next time, I would like to omit the corn syrup, substitute apple sauce for the sugar inside the pancake, and add raisins and/or nuts. Hopefully I'll feel less guilty for using the designated topping.

These are wounderful. What a clever way for pancakes. I made just as written, except I put about 3/4 c. of raisins in the flour mixture, before adding the wet ingredients. Then sprinkled a little bit of chopped walnuts on top before serving. I will diffently be making these again. Thanks.

These were so yummy! I double the recipe because my family likes pancakes and they love snacking on leftovers later in the day. Well we didn't have any leftover. Which is really good since we usually have at least 4 of any pancake recipe. I did not make the frosting I just topped with butter and syrup. Thanks for the recipe will make again.

These were quite good, though I also modified a few things. I used 1 c. all-purpose flour and 1/2 c. whole wheat flour. I eliminated the corn syrup and cut the butter in half. I also used Penzey's Baking Spice in place of the cinnamon (gave it more of a spice bread flavor). We enjoyed them without the icing as well!

Wow, we loved these.  I made them fat-free by using Egg Beaters and liquid fat-free "butter".  They tasted so much like a good, hot cinnamon rolls.  I'll be making these again and again!

I omitted the corn syrup and didn't make the icing. I did add an extra tsp of cinnamon though. The end result was delicious but, a little too sweet for my hubby and I. However, I KNOW that kids would love them. I will make this for my little brother and sister when they come to visit.

My husband and I enjoyed these pancakes so much we made them twice this week. The first time I made the recipe as written, except I omitted the corn syrup and skipped the topping. 

The second time I added an extra teaspoon of cinnamon and topped them with syrup, powdered sugar, a bit more cinnamon, and a pinch of nutmeg. Delicious!

Very good recipe! Last weekend, I made it twice, once for breakfast and once for an afternoon snack. I didn't make the icing, though, and I didn't add the corn syrup. I used 2 tbs. of sugar and it turned out less sweet, so it left room to experiment with toppings. :) Very good with honey and REAAALLY good with chocolate-chocolate chip ice cream! Thanks, Emma!

These were ok, but there was a strange almost overpowering after-taste to them.  I'm not sure if it was too much cinnamon or what. (I scaled the recipe down to 4 servings)  The icing was good, but I'm not sure if I'll make them again.

These were great! A pancake that I actually liked.  My kids and husband ate the left over batter as waffle sticks the next morning.  We made a double batch.  If you are feeding boys, I really recommend a double batch.  We only had enough for 3 sets of waffles the next day.

This were really good and my picky eaters (age 5 and 2) loved it!  I did leave off the icing and was still very good with maple syrup.

This has become a family favorite!  We didn't like the icing style syrup, so we just use maple syrup instead.  We may never eat plain pancakes again.

These were delicious.  I made these the morning after the 4th and received nothing but praise from my family members.  Great with cinnamon honey butter.

This recipe was wonderful! Thanks so much! My husband is the biggest pancake critic and he liked them enough to say, you can make these again! Anyway the only minor problem I had with the recipe was the temp. setting, it was too low for my electric griddle, I would up it to 350' and you are good to go!  Thanks for this yummy breakfast treat!

Sorry, but I thought these pancakes were horrible!! I didn't even get a chance to finish cooking them, they were taking forever and didn't spread like pancakes, just kind of made little glops. I increased the heat a little and they burned instantly. I was really looking forward to trying these and wish they had turned out as good as some other posters said. Definately won't be trying again.

Great 'cakes! I bet kids would just love this one! I made enough for just my boyfriend and I and saved the remaining mix in a seal-tight container for future morning breakfasts. Although there is a sauce, we too added some maple syrup. Thank you Emily!

These are so good! Perfect, fluffy sweet cinnamon pancakes. I just put syrup on them instead of the glaze and they still tasted great. Thanks so much.

Everyone loved them, myself included.  Cinnamon is a great classic flavor.  I only made half the icing that it said to, and that was enough for the whole batch, since I didn't put too much on each pancake.

I followed the recipe to a T and these turned out great.  Such a nice change from regular pancakes!  My daughter, who is not a cinnamon fan, gobbled these up.  The only thing that was off was the amount of milk in the frosting, it needs more to turn into an icing and I could have gotten away with only using one cup of confectioners' sugar instead of two.

The pancakes were nice and fluffy-nothing too exciting. Made as is. My daughter LOVES them so I will make them again for her. The recipe made a ton so that was good. About 14 regular size pancakes. 

The glaze ratios are way off. There is WAY too much vanilla. Overpowering.

LOVED these!!! At first I thought "Wow, that's a lot of cinnamon", but so glad I followed the recipe. I don't know if I can go back to plain old pancakes after this! As others stated, they are sweet with the icing, so serve something savory on the side like sausage.

Some of the best pancakes I've had. I had to add liquid to thin out the batter, but they turned out perfect. After adding the baking soda, I let the batter sit for 5 minutes before cooking. I don't think I'll find a better recipe.

Family loved these. Icing needed more than a tablespoon of milk. I did 2 T and still a bit thick, FYI.  Nice and fluffy and froze leftovers for a quick breakfast before kids head to school.

Loved it! And my kids loved it. I tried to follow the recipe, but had to add more milk because the batter was too thick/dry. it was still very thick. Recipe only made 3 servings (6 pancakes), not the eight servings indicated.

Awesome pancake recipe!I used cinnamon sugar instead of plain cinnamon because that's all we had in the house.  I also didn't put confectioners sugar in because I had already put in the cinnamon sugar. Everyone in the house gave it a 10/10. This recipe is a keeper!!

keeping this review simply I had to find an out for the store bought pancake mix, didn't want to go the Bisquick route either, had a bad experience w Bisquick. I found this recipe and based on all the gd reviews decided to gve it a go. Turned out wonderful. I like the taste of cinnamon so i added a little extra. I didn't make the frosting, instead made a blueberry compo(topping) w some frozen blueberries I had. The pancakes were delicious and with the blueberry topping and a bit of maple syrup, the different flavors of the cinnamon in the back of my throat, then the sweetness of the blueberries done w a hint of ,orange juice, almond and vanilla extracts, yeah they were great. Another recipe for the recipe box . Thanks

I used half white and half whole wheat flour.  Skipped the corn syrup.  These def needed the glaze to be good.  Was really hoping for something special here but would prefer regular pancakes next time.  More like two stars for us but since I changed ing a bit a bumped to three stars to be fair.

Delicious and will do again. Definitely not eight servings, though, unless each serving is just one pancake.

Yum! Only change was to add a little cream cheese to the icing mix. Excellent texture and taste. Loved that they were so close to regular cinnamon rolls. Kids and hubby loved them.

My son really wanted me to make these so I did, but I have to say that we weren't impressed. I think that the ratios are off - it's way too much cinnamon, sugar and baking powder and even lowering those items significantly, they were still too sweet and too heavy. If I were to make these again, I would omit the corn syrup, (I didn't use that this time either) and cut the cinnamon and baking powders in at least half.

Made these into Gluten Free/Dairy free and they were pretty good! Used gluten free flour + xanathan gum for flour and rice milk and earth balance in replace of milk and butter! Will make again!

It's grrrrrrreat!!! My brothers and sisters loved it?  However the frosting gets a bit stiff if it sits for more than three minutes, and we ended up adding two tablespoons of milk to it.

It was delicious. I gave it a 5 because it was so good, but it wasn't perfect. It might have been my fault, but the frosting didn't work that well. Even without the frosting, the griddle cakes were gone as soon as I finished cooking them. Thank you so much for the great recipe!

I was thinking that it was a whole lot of cinnamon and vanilla, but we loved it.  I used a cup of whole wheat flour and half a cup of AP, instead. I also left out the corn syrup, replaced it with just a tablespoon of maple syrup, and it turned out fine.

A nice change from regular pancakes.  I skipped the corn syrup as per other reviews and reduced the sugar by a tablespoon.  Some review said there was too much cinnamon and others too little - I followed the recipe and it was just great.  I halfed the icing, but added more milk and it was just the right amount for the two of us.

These are fabulous!  I had to sub maple syrup for the corn syrup because I didn't have any on hand and I think that sent them way over the yummy meter.  An absolute keeper of a recipe.

I made these for the family and they were a big hit.  I omitted the corn syrup per the suggestion of other reviews.  I also substituted half of the flour with whole wheat flour.  They turned out light and fluffy and the icing is just perfect with them.  These will be a favorite.

Delicious! Much easier and faster than cinnamon buns for breakfast. I made just 2 changes: used all whole wheat flour and added some cinnamon to the glaze my husband said the cinnamon glaze was the best part!). Next time I will probably cut the glaze down by 1/4 or 1/3 though, we didn't really need the whole thing.

These pancakes are a wonderful way to spice up the breakfast table!  They smell amazing and taste just as great.  I did leave out the corn syrup as well as the topping to cut down on sugar and they turned out perfect!  I also used 1 cup white flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour - what a treat!  Definitely recommend as a fun way to treat the family for breakfast!

Didn't bother to make the topping, but probably should have as my daughter didn't think they were sweet enough on their own and didn't think regular syrup would taste good on such a cinnamon-y pancake. Didn't use corn syrup.

These were very tasty.  I made them in to mini-muffins only because they are easier to feed to the kids that way.  I didn't make the icing (just served with syrup) but I'm sure they'd be delicious with it.

Fantastic recipe!  I substituted whole wheat flour, ommited corn syrup, added additional tbl cinnamon and added cinnamon chips.  Dusted with powder sugar instead of syrup.  Yummy!  Really does taste like a "cake".

I used 1/2 cup of WW flour and 1 cup unbleached AP. I also omitted the corn syrup per others reviews and added apple sauce instead of oil. I let these sit over night in the fridge and then used a 1/4 cup to scoop the batter into the pan. These were a huge hit! In fact boyfriend is a meat & potatoe breakfast kind of guy and ate 5 pancakes! Thanks so much for sharing.

The pancakes are SOO good! My husband and kids tore them up and they kept raving on and on about them.   A lot of the reviews substituted more milk for the corn syrup, but I did a mixture of both. I lessened the corn syrup to 1/2 tbspn and added 2 tbspns of more milk. I also added another tbspn of cinnamon.   For the topping, I found that it needed about 6 tbspns of milk to make it creamy. Other than that, I followed the recipe as is and they came out just right! I will definately make this again and again.

Easy to make.  Nice alternative to cinnamon rolls.  I added 1 tsp. extra of cinnamon as other reviewers recommended--good cinnamon flavor, but not overpowering.  My kids & spouse loved them!

My husband says, "I Love It!"  I love cinnamon rolls, but lack the ambition or patience to make them.... this satisfies that craving quickly and easily.  I made a few changes to the recipe: used soymilk, replaced eggs with 2 T flax meal soaked in 4 T water, oil instead of butter, omitted the corn syrup, and thinned out the batter with a bit more milk.  The icing needed more than 1 T milk.  Thanks for the delicious recipe!

AMAZING and amazingly easy. Great taste and a quick cinnamon roll fake out. I did have to make 1.5 times the drizzle recipe so that we weren't all fighting over the last little bit.

Very tasty and very easy! I doubled the recipe so I could have extras for the kids morning breakfast. I skipped the corn syrup and powdered sugar glaze, since I was limiting the kids sugar intake.  I added about a half tablespoon more of cinnamon but next time will keep to the original amounts.  The batter was thick but they spread out nicely and were very moist and fluffy.  I will make these again and can't believe this recipe has sat so long in my recipe box!

Everyone I've made these for LOVE them!!  I use raw sugar (which is sweeter so you use less AND it's not bleached!)  I also omitted the corn syrup, added an extra teaspoon of cinnamon & vanilla to both the batter & the icing.  We just drizzled the icing on while they were still hot  - WAY less sugar then traditional pancakes since we didn't need syrup and no need to top w/ butter either.  You can also replace the butter w/ unsweetened applesauce for a lower fat version.
GREAT recipe!!  A saturday morning staple in our house.

These were soo good! They came out perfect and Fluffy. I substituted 1/2 of the flour for whole wheat flour for variety. And the powdered sugar sauce...just make sure you only put the tiniest bit on each, or they will be way too sweet.

These are very good. They really do taste like a cinnamon roll. At first it threw me off because I had expectations of a cinnamon pancake but once I accepted that they were more like a cinnamon roll, I loved them.

I typically shy away from pancakes as they tend to end up either too heavy or too bland.  These turned out perfectly -- fluffy and full of flavor.  I omitted the salt as I only had salted butter, and used maple syrup instead of the glaze.

These had a good flavor, but the texture was crumbly.  They didn't cook well, spreading a lot and getting ragged around the edges, and breaking apart very easily.  I could've gotten the same cinnamon roll flavor from using my own pancake recipe (which calls for 1/4 cup sugar) and adding a tablespoon of cinnamon.  That's what I'll do next time.

Loved this recipe, my kids all ate it, and then had the left overs cold, dipped in the icing. Didn't have corn syrup-left it out. I enjoyed my pancake with a sugar free maple syrup, and it was great, but my kids raved about the icing, and have requested them again next weekend.
