This was a pretty dessert. I put it in two small drink glasses. I added a couple of extra Tblsp. of powdered sugar to the cheese. I tried a little with the almond exract, but preferred it without. For some reason, when I was done with the layers I still had half of the graham crumbs left. My crumbs wouldn't come together, and think maybe they were expiring. I used 1/2, but honestly think I would have preferred much less. I liked the combination of the flavors of the sweetened ricotta, peaches, and chocolate. I would not have thought to put those flavors together and liked how it wasn't too sweet. The 3 together, only, with a little lite whipped topping would have been fine to me. Now, I just have to figure out what else to do with this ricotta cheese? I never have bought it before, it's actually not too bad.

Really really good. I doubled the mixture and mine turned out a bit runny but I used whole ricotta cheese because thats what I had and it was pretty runny (I blame the ingredient swap) so I threw in about 4oz of cream cheese to make it firm enough no problem after that. I also wasn't crazy about the idea of putting the chocolate on top of the peaches so I packed down all the crumbs into a pie dish and topped with the chocolate threw it in the oven enough to soften it and spread it around the crumbs it turned out kinda like a chocolate coated cannoli shell. It was loved by the entire family and really impressive looking for how easy it is to throw together I can't wait to try it with other fruit combinations.

Wonderful...a keeper!   I made a few alterations....I used whole milk ricotta (I always do), doubled the ricotta and vanilla but only 1/3 C sugar and kept the almond extract at a shy 1/2 tsp.  I used the 1/2 C graham crumbs but added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and used grated dark chocolate on all the layers and topped with sliced fresh strawberries. This is an wonderfully adaptable recipe and can be used as a base for many fruits by changing the spice/ flavoring!  Thanks for sharing Lillian.

This was really yummy and SO quick. I made them in plastic cups before company came. I made each serving a little smaller than the recipe called for and used a variety of fruits. The pears were the best IMO (peaches, raspberries and pears were what I had on hand). Yum!

Excellent! I had a small triffle dish I made the dessert in and it came out very nice.  Presented beautifully and tasted just as good.  Will make again!

I didn't like this, but I'm sure I didn't do it right so don't let me discourage you. The only thing I would say is do not deviate from the plan.

The ricotta just made the whole dessert a weird texture. Other than that, it was pretty good.

Isn't going to be a keeper for us.  Followed recipe exactly except I added in a few extra tablespoons of sugar like several reviewers suggested but it just wasn't sweet enough for us nor did it have enough flavor.  Maybe more vanilla and almond extract would have helped.
