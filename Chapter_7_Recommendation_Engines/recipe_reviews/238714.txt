This recipe is great! My whole family loved it. I replaced the veggie meat with tenderized lightly seasoned beef and veggie stock with beef stock. We are planning on making it again real soon.

This dish is super easy. I always add extra fresh garlic and lemon zest. My husband is not vegan so he eats it as a side dish. It's usually my main dish. Easy to make and taste good. Win.
