These tasted great!  I put "Mom's Dill Sauce" submitted by Carol46 on them, and they were delicious.  We'll definitely make them again!

My family loved these, said they were very taste. We liked the cornmeal on them , made them extra cruncy.

My family LOVED this recipe!! I scaled the recipe down to 5 servings. My only substitution was using fresh cooked salmon in place of canned. This will definitely be made in our house again since there was no fishy taste.  Served with thousand island dressing.

I loved the idea of rolling the patties
in cornmeal.  It gave them a crunchy 
coating when fried.  Very good.

Excellent - I had to use bread crumbs in place of the crackers, but the patties were delicious and we will definitely have them again - soon

These are good for salmon patties...I grew up on these.  Once I had the taste of fresh salmon, though, I have a hard time eating these.  Don't get me wrong these were really good...I just prefer the taste of fresh salmon, so what I did was make the fresh stuff and use it in this recipe...and of course it tastes 10 times better.  Thanks for posting.

Very good!  Alot like what my mom used to make.  I added a little bit of garlic salt since I didn't have garlic on hand.  And used a creamy dill sauce to dip them in.  Growing up we used to use ketchup, but ketchup would have ruined the taste of these wonderful salmon patties.

I added 2 eggs since there was previous reviewers that said it did not stick.  It still didn't stick.  It didn't really have good flavor either.

Followed recipe as written but did not have saltines so subtituted bread crumbs instead (approx. 1 T for ea. cracker).  The cornmeal gave it a really nice crispness.  For those that complained about them falling apart, be gentle!  You'll be rewarded with a really nice and easy salmon patty!  Make it even better...serve with the Creamy Dill Dipping Sauce from this site.  WOW...

Was a bit dry with the meal..I usually use crackers, but decided to try this one...it's a keeper...my advice is to just cut back a bit on the meal..

this was awesome - best salmon patties I have ever had.  only thing I added was 4 tablespoons of mayonnaise, and used 2 eggs instead of one.  Also used crushed garlic croutons instead of saltines.  Amazing!

I used fresh salmon in this recipe that I had left over from the night before.  I mixed in the cornmeal with the mixture and added another egg.  They turned out somewhat like a hush puppy with salmon and my kids loved them.

Too much bread and not enough fish.  It tasted like fishy cornmeal.  Lacks flavor.  I recommend finding a different recipe, rather than trying to fix this one.

they were pretty good...but still a little too "fishy" tasting...i love samon, but apparently not canned salmon. i dipped them in a ranch sauce: 2 tbs. ranch, 1tsp. olive oil and 1tsp. sugar.

The patties would not stick together. I had to add about 1/2 cup of mayo to make them stick together, but it wasn't enough to cover them in the cornmeal. So I mixed a little cornmeal in too. They tasted ok. I was not pleased with this recipe!

I tried these and they were sort of bland.  I made some changes to the recipe and they came out great.  I used seasoned bread crumbs instead of cornmeal, added dried parsley, worcestershire sauce, and milk.  One can of salmon works well with this also.  A tip, frying them in olive oil makes a big difference.

I made salmon patties for the first time ever tonight using this recipe as a base, and I would definitely make them again. I did double the recipe and added 2 tsp of Old Bay Seasoning, 1tsp of garlic powder, 1/2 tsp of pepper, and used seasoned bread crumbs as I didn't have saltines. I found they did have a little trouble staying together, but I'm not sure if they were too wet or too dry. I used 2 eggs even though the recipe, even when doubled, still called for just 1. All in all, they were really good. My husband said they tasted like crab cakes.

Pleasantly surprised. I've never had canned salmon before and was a little nervous when I first opened the can, but I fixed it according to the recipe - plus one egg and some extra spices - and it turned out really good! No problems with it sticking, you just have to be gentle.

These were surprisingly tasty!  (I had bad memories of eating dry, nasty salmon patties growing up.)  The pink salmon I used came in a 7 oz. foil bag so I scaled back this recipe accordingly; ended up making only 3 patties.  The 1 egg ended up holding the 3 patties together fairly well.  I did use Italian bread crumbs in place of the corn meal.  No celery.  Fried in canola/olive oil combo.  Go easy on the salt and add a bit of dill.  Nice, lite main dish.

These were the best salmon patties I've ever made.  I tend to be a "do it yourselfer" cook but my salmon patties all fall apart.  These did not and they were yummy - my goal was to make them exactly as written.  I always make any recipe from a website as written and rate it as written.  However - I wasn't paying attention to what was written and added the cornmeal to the patties.  My Cuisinart Smart Stick chopper did a great job of chopping the veggies fine, which my husband prefers.  Anyway - they still turned out delicious.  I suppose because I did use all the ingredients.  However, because I messed up and added the cornmeal I did have to add a little egg beater to add more liquid.  They stayed together perfectly.  I made the crock pot refried beans on all recipes with this.  Good meal.  Thanks for posting these - I looked everywhere for what sounded like a good salmon patty recipe with veggies.

I use a little different variation, but this is excellent and my whole family loves it.  I use 1 can salmon and 1 can mackerel(makes it more moist) I omit the celery and lightly roll in flour instead of cornmeal, then just enough oil to brown on both sides.  We eat it with ketsup.  Delicious!

I love salmon patties.  I find that if you drain the meat first, get rid of the juice, the patties stay together.  I have never tried celery in mine, but it is worth a try.  I also use two eggs instead of one.

After reading the other reviews I substituted the crackers for 2 small potatoes that were cooked in the microwave and then mashed skin included, and added 2 tbsp of light mayo w/ 2 eggs, a little dillweed and lemon/garlic seasoning. They held together great, were meaty with very little trace of the potato. My neice and nephew were staying over and was quite upset there was not more. They were very delicious and I will deffinitely make again

I am not an expert on salmon patties, because I just started eating them, but these were good.  I cut the recipe in half and it was enough for 2 people.  I'm also not a big fan of celery, so I left it out.  I love the cornmeal.

This recipe was very good. I changed a few things though...I used flour instead of cornmeal and I added another egg. I used the liquid from the canned salmon. The recipe doesnt say either way but it really made them taste great. I did however have problems with them falling apart while flouring them so I just held them in my hand and floured each side. They cooked very well and had no problems during that process. Thanks!

I followed ingrediants and steps perfect and found a great tasting patty that would not stay together so I added 1 more egg, flour, and some milk to the 2nd batch. I made the patties small and thin and fried them medium high. We came up with a great salmon patty.

I used this recipe as a base. I make a similar one usually, except I omit the celery and add about a teaspoon of brown mustard and a little old bay. Make sure you drain MOST of the juice from the can. Really break apart the meat and bones with a fork, I think it holds together better when it's not huge flakes of fish. 

I see some complaining about it being dry, but I think people over look the fact that you don't add the cornmeal to the inside of the mixture, just the outside. Put your crackers into a zip lock bag and crush with a rolling pin or a heavy glass cup.

I found this recipe because I thought the idea of having a crunchy exterior of cornmeal much like on fried fish would be delicious. And it was! I added a bit of flour to mine too to stretch it a bit, also a little old bay and some chili flakes for some kick!

It makes an excellent crust if you fry with a little oil in a cast iron pan.

Good but make sure to let the pan heat up completely before you put in the patties.

These were wonderful!  Even my daughter, who dislikes salmon, liked them - and wanted the leftovers.  I agree with the reviewer that recommended Mom's Dill Sauce - it was a terrific combination.  Thanks for the recipe!

I started with some fresh oven-baked salmon that I had left-over.  After reading the reviews, I took the advice of HISGIRLTOY1125 and substituted 3 boiled & then mashed potatoes plus a little mayo for the crackers.  I added one grated carrot for a little more color and nutrition and a teaspoon of dillweed for a little more flavor.  I made a bunch of little patties - 3 inches across - so they'd be easier to flip without falling apart and cooked them on a griddle brushed with oil.  Served them with cream dill sauce.  Delicious.  Definitely a "keeper."

Good basic recipe. My mom made these like this. As an adult,  I prefer DRAINED and cartilage removed canned salmon or fresh flaked, adding a chopped green onion, dash or two of  ground cayenne pepper, lots of fresh cracked black pepper, a fresh minced garlic clove and some cheddar cheese and mix all ingredients THEN gently fold in the salmon (so its not too mushy). Oh, and there are many sauces that are wonderful (especially creamy dill)but basic ketchup is great also. Yum!

if you add some leftover mashed potatoes, a few tbsp of fresh dill chopped up,omit the crackers and form into patties they turned out great with a nice dill sauce. Yummy!

The flavor was good but they didn't hold together as paddies very well.  Easier to fry them like hash.

I had never made salmon patties before. This recipe was fast and easy to follow. I had trouble, though, getting them to hold together to roll in the cornmeal so just held them in my hand and patted the cornmeal into them. I also cut the recipe in half so was perfect for two. My picky husband went back for more. They were great.

I had never used the big cans of salmon before so it was weird for me to see skin and bones with fish all rolled up.. took me forever to meticulously de-bone them, while my grandfather told me when my grandmother made them they'd just eat the  bones O.o
Anywho, I always put a Tablespoon or two in my salmon patties, I usually grate the onion but I tried it chopped and LOVED the texture. The only other thing I added was dill. I also had a hard time with them falling apart but once we got the cornmeal on there, it helped a lot. I cooked in cast iron skillet with walnut oil. I used someone else's suggestion and paired it with creamy dill dipping sauce you can search on allrecipes. I used plain yogurt because I had no sour cream and died dill because I had no fresh. This was delicious and I would definitely make it again!

Since some of the reviews stated that their patties wouldn't hold together, I checked my mixture.  Mine was not wet enough either, so what wet ingredient did we add....egg.  I used a second egg and they turned out great!

This is a really good recipe. I served them with sliced tomatoes, pieces of spinach, and mushroom gravy which I made by combining 1 can of cream of mushroom soup with 1 can of water, a little bit of chopped celery and onions and heated on the stove. We poured the gravy over the salmon patties, then ate them with the tomatoes and spinach. I also made couscous for a side item, which went really well with the patties. Great recipe! The whole family enjoyed it!

Just like my mother used to make. I like it better with flour instead of cornmeal though. My kids like them with ketchup.

I did not like this recipe at all.  The crunch of the celery and raw onion was too much with the delicate salmon.  I tried a second time and sauteed the vegetables and it was still no good

The patties didn't want to hold together very well so patted the corn meal on. I've made this twice and used flour also and like the flour best. Also cooked in butter instead of oil. Evern though they didn't hold together well, they tasted great. We ate them all and i'd make again.

I didn't use celery, and they didn't come out like patties, they came out looking like ground beef.  I put it in between slices of bread anyway, and it was pretty good.  I ate it with barbeque sauce (don't ask) and it made for a great lunch!

Very good recipe...I did add some dill to the patties and an extra egg just to make sure they held together.  I also used green olives instead of celery and the kids loved them big time!

This is the first time I've made salmon patties and I don't care for salmon myself, but they're one of hubby's favorites so I made them for him. He said they were good, a solid three, but definitely not on the same level as his grandma's recipe. It's hard to beat Grandma.

It's great.  Thanks for posting.  These were the best I've ever made.  I used my electric frypan.  The cornmeal helped set the patties and gave them a nice crunch.

These were very good, simple and quick...3 great things when put together for a recipe! We didnt use the celery as we hate celery and they were great without it! I used a Lemon Sauce that was posted on here and it was awesome! will definitely make these again.

Loved this recipe but maded a few changes for more low carb, diabetic friendly and zesty taste: Changed to 1 cup of Italian bread crumbs and added 1/4 cup of grated parmesan. Mixed then 3/4 cup into fish remaining for coating of patties. Also used minced red onions and 2 egg whites instead of whole egg. Pan seared in grapeseed oil. Dip made of with rice vinegar and fat free cream cheese.  Even the people at the table without dietary issues enjoyed.

The flavour was okay, but not all that outstanding so I added about 1 TBSP of dried dill. I had a real hard time with the patties falling apart. I used extra eggs, but that did not help. I'm not sure that I'll try this recipe again.

This is 99% exactly as my mother used to make salmon patties for us kids!! The only thing different was she did not roll in cornmeal. I tried. I loved it. Thank you for reminding me of some of the comfort foods my mom used to make while she was alive. She passed 3 yrs after my dad...so I am sure she is happier now she is with her husband of 63 yrs! Thank you!

I used 1 can of salmon, half an onion, 2-3 cloves of minced garlic, breadcrumbs mixed with Italian dressing seasoning mix, half a stalk of celery, 2 eggs, salt-pepper-garlic powder-union powder & fresh dill (about 3 sprigs). I baked them for 15 minutes @ 450 (I don’t eat fried food) then broil for 2 minutes to add some crisp.

Really good! I added some milk to keep it from crumbling when I cooked it. That helped a lot. I also added a touch of hot sauce. I like the corn meal on the outside. It gives it a good texture. Delicious, easy and nutritious meal!

I have made several times, its a very easy recipe,  It is a hit at our table.  Be gentle with the patty and it will hold together well.  I fried in corn/olive oil combination and it tastes great.

I made these last night minus the celery. I just followed my Mother's old recipe from watching her make these and they turned out awesome. Quick, easy and inexpensive.  I served with some buttered rice and loaded chef salad.

The recipe didn't say to drain the canned salmon, so I umed that the crackers would absorb the moisture, but it didn't. After the first panful of patties ended up in a big mess that I fed to the dog, I added a lot of cornmeal to the mixture to make them into something that would keep its form while frying.

I pretty much made it as per recipe except with fresh bbq'ed salmon and then made the mistake of tasting it before the cornmeal and frying.   It was so good that I just put it on a little lettuce and ate it straight away.  I'll try to get to the frying part next time.

They were good. I do like the recipes that have mayo and lemon juice a bit more as they make for a more moist cake and hold together a little better. I did add a little Old Bay and omit the celery because I didn't have any on hand. I ate them with remoulade and fresh spinach on French bread.

Delicious, especially the corn meal coating.  It was a bit tricky making the patties since the mixture didn't hold together well, but well worth the trouble.

These were amazing! I did add fresh garlic, lemon juice and lemon pepper then rolled them in Aunt Jemima's Buttermilk Corn meal Mix with a little added sugar and old Bay seasoning!

My Aunt Joan K. did not use eggs (they make them tough) and removed the skins and the larger bones (crunch up the fine  bones in the can.) This recipe is for one 15 oz. can. Take a fork and crush it all up in the can ( leave some of the liquid.) Place this in a medium sized mixing bowl. Put your favorite seasonings (such as minced celery and onions or if you don't have fresh, use celery seed or salt and minced onions.) A little salt, pepper, and a pinch of paprika (if you like Old Bay Seafood Seasoning , a pinch or 2 is also good.) Add 1/2 cup to 3/4 cups cornmeal and 1 to 1& 1/ 2 Tbsp flour. I like to add 5 or 6 crushed buttery crackers, like Ritz or Townhouse. Add more cornmeal as needed. I add about 1/4 cup vegetable or canola oil blend to the mix in the bowl and 2 Tbsp. milk so it won't be dry (I have used about 3 Tbsp. of mayonnaise when I did not have the milk and oil on hand; yes, I know this small amount of mayo does contain a little bit of egg.) Heat Crisco shortening (about 1/2 to 2/3 c.) in an electric skillet (12x12in.) to 350 to 375 F. 
  Scoop out mixture w/ ice cream scoop (not all the way full)  or a heaping tablespoon and smash with your hands into patties (again, use cornmeal as needed.) Cook about 4 to 5 mins. each side.  ( p.s.  use shortening, not oil to fry the patties.) If you are not using the lemon sauce at this site, squeeze 1/2 to 3/4 's of  1 seedless lemon on the patties when finished. Thanks, Lesa  p.s. try the lemon sauce; it is awesome!!!

This reminds me the recipe I had when I was a child. It was my first attempt, and I used brown trout and I thought the flavor was very good. I also think the recipe left room for variations that would also change the flavor to your liking. Will be making again.

Great Recipe . I Used 2 Beated Eggs Instead Of One and Put Old Bay Seasoning Along With Salt and Pepper. Put Two Tablespoons Of Goya Sofrito Because I Didn't Have Any Onions and Jiffy Corn Muffin Mix Instead Of Corn Meal . It Was Absolutely DELICIOUS !!

If I could give more then 5 stars I would. Amazing recipe. Didn't have any crackers so I used oats and used Pam instead of oil.

these taste good, but they fall apart in the pan trying to flip them, do not like that
