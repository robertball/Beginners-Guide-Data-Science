I typically thread my meat separate from the veggies due to cooking time but it actually worked out nicely in this recipe. Food just seems more fun on a stick and I will make this again!

Everyone loved them.  Definitely tasted like fajitas.   Marinated for 2.5 hours, cooked on grill, turned over once.  Served on white rice, it made for 7 skewers (12inch).
