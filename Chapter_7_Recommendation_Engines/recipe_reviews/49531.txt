Great marinade - simple and easy with very good results.  I used Sam Adam's beer - no lite beers recommended for this one.  I omitted the water and salt.  I also used low sodium soy sauce, minced garlic from a jar, added 2 Tbsp. of brown sugar, and 1/2 tsp. of ground ginger.  I let it set in a ziploc bag overnight.  It was great - I defintely want to try this one with boneless pork.

MY FAVORITE CHICKEN RECIPE!   I've been making this for two years now, and it's a family favorite. Yes, it was too salty the first time, but instead of adding the water, I use 1/2 cup soy sauce and 1.5 cup beer, clove of garlic, and skip the salt & pepper. No light beer!

Very Very good!  After reading some of the reviews on how salty this dish was I used only half of the beer and soy sauce.  This was very good. my whole family loved it.  I served baked potatos and corn with it.

Way too salty!! I used low sodium soy sauce and added no additional salt and it was still way to salty. The chicken was tender, but the saltiness of it overshadowed any good qualities

Overall it's good, but it's very salty.  I recommend using the low sodium soy sauce and marinating it for only a short time.

Tasted great and smelled amazing!! I don't have a grill so I put it in the oven at 400 for 45 minutes and my house smelled so good! I was a little scared to try it cause I'm not a huge soy sauce fan but it tasted great

Sorry to just echo other reviews, but this is really, really salty (and I have a pretty high tolerance for salt!). The taste was so-so; we won't be making this again.

A very easy and tasty marinade.  I will use this many times.  A great teriyaki marinade.  Try it, you'll see what I mean.

I have always liked using soy sauce as a marinade and the beer just gave it a very interesting flavor...I really liked the taste.  Did'nt have fresh garlic, so I used garlic powder instead. Will definately be making this again!

Very good brine for chicken.  I also made this exchanging buttermilk for the water and it made the chicken very moist.

Used to soak my chicken is straight soy sauce and sometimes it got a little strong.  By cutting the soy sauce with beer it eliminated that problem.  Very moist chicken with just the right tang of soy sauce in every bite!

This was delicious! However I made some modifications- 1 cup beer, 1/2 cup light soy sauce, salt, pepper, red pepper flake, 3 cloves of smashed garlic and one fresh jalapeno cut up with seeds. Marinated in ziplock over-night. The chicken was amazing!

I didn't follow the recipe exactly as I also added honey to the mixture. Ended up with a sticky, caramelised coating for the chicken. Delicious!

Not a lot of flavor other than salt.  Maybe use Lite Soy Sauce, no water, 1/2 cup olive oil, more garlic, then season the chicken to your liking before putting on the grill.

Really liked this one.  I was looking for a beer marinade because I've heard beer keeps chicken very moist.  This was great.  I used the whole bottle of beer instead of adding water.  I cut the soy sauce in half as recommended by other reviewers.  Marinated only a couple hours and grilled.  It came out excellent.  Chicken was very flavorfull and moist.  I made this chicken a second time with Blue Moon beer (because it was what I had on hand) and decided to add orange slices (as is done when drinking Blue Moon) to the marinade.  This was a fabulous variation!

I also omitted water and added a splash of lemon. After the chicken was on the grill, I brought the remaining marinade to a rolling boil and then poured it over the chicken. We really liked this!

There really isn't anything wrong with this recipe, but it doesn't "wow" me in any way either. Probably much better on the outside grill than broiled or grilled on the stovetop. I also added a little more beer, and although I prepared the recipe technically for two servings, I used three breasts of chicken which definitely worked out better.

Used a bottle of New Castle, 1/2 worc. 1/4 soy sauce, 1 cup water. Poured into saucepan and added chicken breasts. Brought to boil and reduced amount of sauce to sautee chicken in. Pretty good! Maybe next time I"ll try marinading first.

Great simple marinade. As others suggested, I used 1/2 cup soy, 1 1/2 cups GOOD beer, and no additional salt. I used bone-in chicken and grilled to perfection. For added zing, try brushing a little Hoisin on the chicken while it is grilling.

Pretty good, and an unusual flavour. I made this on my indoor grill, and boy, does the kitchen ever smell like beer when you're done! The chicken came out tasty and juicy, though.

Great Recipe. To reduce the salty taste i split the 1/2 cup soy sauce by mixing it with sweet soy sauce.

I only used 1/2 cup of the soy sauce, nearly a whole 12 oz can of beer (not light), and added 3 crushed cloves of garlic (my family loves garlic) and marinated the chicken for about 6 hours. It turned out wonderful! Very moist, not too salty, and very favorful. This recipe is a great starting point for marinade, but I think it needs to be altered too much to warrent 5 stars.

I baked this instead of grilling it and it came out wonderful. I did cut the soysauce in half and used almost a whole bottle of wheat beer. I served it over rice and poured the extra sauce over it.

PRETTY GOOD RECIPE. I MARINATED MY CHICKEN FOR ABOUT 6 HOURS. FOLLOWED THE ADVICE TO USE 1 1/2 CUPS BEER AND ONLY 1/2 CUP SOY SAUCE, TURNED OUT GOOD. NOT TOO SALTY, WHICH IS A NICE CHANGE. WOULD USE AGAIN FOR SURE.

This recipe would be a lot better with low-salt soy sauce and maybe 1 1/2 cups beer, 1/2 soy sauce.

It was kinda salty. Next time I think I will either cut down on the soy sauce or use tamari in place of the soy sauce. However, the beer and garlic gave the chicken a nice flavor. I grilled it indoors on the George Forman Grill and it was good.

There is potential here but as the recipe stands it was far too salty for my family. Next time I would double the beer, omit the water and definitely use low sodium soy.

I was really worried that this wasn't going to have enough flavor and was going to fall flat, especially with adding a cup of water to the mix.  I was pleasantly surprised that the chicken had a wonderful flavor.

A tip, though.  I used a lighter beer and would occasionally get a hint of beer flavor, with more of the soy sauce flavor (I added no additional salt, just pepper and garlic) without being overly salty.  Next time, I'm going to try with an amber or darker beer to try to pick up more of the flavor.

A huge hit in our house.  I added this to our menu not realizing the chicken needed to be grilled.  Since we have just moved into our house, we are not have a grill.  So I baked the chicken breasts @ 375 for 40 min.  Chicken came out perfect and everyone really enjoyed it.  I will be making this chicken again real soon, and we will definitely be grill some this summer.  A do-over.  (I used Yuengling)

I marinated the chicken overnight.   The chicken was very tender however the cup of soy sauce caused the chicken to be very, very salty.  If I ever made this again I would cut the soy sauce in half.  My husband who eats anything asked me to prepare him something else due to the salt.

Extremely easy.  I used 3 to 4 garlic cloves instead.  Definitely marinade AT LEAST 8 hours (I tried 1 hour the first time and it didn't absorb enough flavor).  Very tasty!!
