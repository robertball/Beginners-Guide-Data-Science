These turned out really good.  I followed the recipe except for using pizza sauce instead of the tomato paste...though it would be more flavorful (and I believe it was).  We added pepperoni and sausages to the sandwiches.  Tasted just like our regular pizza...but since they were in the crescent rolls...much better.  They turn out so flaky and delicious.  Thanks for the post.

I didn't get to try these b/c they were gone almost as soon as I served them. I added "pizza sliced" pepperoni. I served these with other tried and true appetizers from this site and these were one of the quickest to go (however, I assume that's partially due to the fact they don't make alot). My only complaint: I didn't like how the paste looked on top of the rolls. I might just bake without and then serve with pizza sauce as a dip alternative for my guests instead.

Not bad!  Very quick.  I used shredded mozzarella instead.  Next time, I'll put in mushrooms and pepperoni, kinda like a calzone.  Thanks!

My daughter so LOVES this for lunch. She makes sure that I get the rolls to make them when we go grocery shopping. I use the plum tomato paste with a little sprinkle of italian seasoning and it so rocks. Also, I give it a little parm cheese too. If I'm hungry I'll mix baby bella mushrooms with a drizzle of EVOO and a clove of minced garlic in a bowl and stick it in the microwave for about 30 seconds. I use the mushrooms & garlic for the inside and coat the outside with the remaining EVOO and WOW, it's great. Fabulous recipe!!

Very tasty and fast. I even added spinach to it to give it an extra kick.

Delicious! I separated the 4 squares, and we added what we wanted to the tomato and oregano base - I had red onion, cheeses, fresh tomato and proscuitto; Husband had cheeses, pepperoni and jalepeno. This is a really great idea - would be excellent for kids! Thanks, Joe!

I admit these were quite easy, much easier than rolling out dough.  I can also see this *concept* as a good basis for custom building (adding pepperoni or whatever)... except that I thought they were too much dough, could hardly taste any cheese, and unfortunately could taste the tomato paste far too much.  If I use a different sauce, a different cheese, etc., then really, the only thing I've taken from this recipe is the idea of using crescent rolls.

It was pretty good, but seemed kind of sweet (because of the tomato paste).  I also added spinach (frozen, thawed, drained).  Next time I'll probably mix the paste with tabasco or use pizza sauce instead, and add some sort of thinly sliced meat.

Very good. Used spaghetti sauce instead of the tomato paste. Be sure to use thick sauce though! The runny, thin ones aren't for me. This is easily adaptable to whatever you want to put on top! What is fun if that each family member can customize!

I really wanted to like this recipe, who wouldn't like a quick and easy pizza style meal. The Crescent dough is a bit to sweet and clashes with the pizza sauce and pepperoni. I did like the fact it was quick and easy, but due to taste, I felt this failed to wet my appetite for more. Perhaps a different dough may help.

This was fast, easy, and pretty good tasting.  I liked these pizza sandwiches much better than a certain famous stuffed pizza sandwich you buy in the frozen foods section-completely customizable and really very good with a crescent dough crust. I used pizza sauce as did some of the other reviewers and it worked out fine.  The oregano was a very nice touch!  Three issues I had: 1. I mis-read the instructions, when I thought I was to separate into four rectangles and add two slices of cheese to each, I did this to all four pieces...then I realized I was only supposed to do it to two of the rectangles and that the other two were supposed to go over the tops. 2. Cooking according to directions, it seemed that the dough wasn't quite done, I wound up adding another 7 minutes to get a nice golden brown. 3. I am lazy and hate scrubbing burned cheese off my cookie sheets, so I used foil-I think if you are going to do this, the foil needs a light coat of butter in case of stickage.  Good little recipe, thanks for sharing!

Kids thought these were ok, but nothing they raved about.  I think the tomato paste was too strong a flavor for the  crescent roll dough, pizza sauce would be much better I think.  I don't think there will be a repeat of this, although I may use the idea of using the crescent roll dough to make hot meat and cheese sandwiches.

Cooked great. I added pepperoni and it worked well, but the tomato paste made it a bit sweet. I intend to add a tomato sauce with a milder flavor next time.

These are really good.  I made them with my kids and they thought it was really fun.  Ours had sauce and cheese oozing out the sides, so they weren't pretty to look at but they tasted good.  I used Ragu pizza sauce in lieu of tomato paste and oregano and used shredded mozzarella and added pepperoni.  This recipe is great because it tastes good and it is easy to involve the kids.  The taste itself isn't necessarily five stars, but the ease and the kid-friendliness make it so.

These were "OK". They made for a quick dinner though! I was home sick and looking for something effortless to pull together for dinner. My bf came over to "check in" so I needed an "impromptu" dinner for the two of us. I can't seem to ever follow directions exactly, so I did end up changing a few things to suit my/our tastes. I added a small amount of cooked & crumbled hot pork sausage (a quarter of a lb. total) and sliced deli pepperoni (i.e. not the small pre-packaged slices) for a heartier sandwich. I also subbed jarred pizza sauce for the tomato paste and Italian seasoning (to taste) for the oregano called for. To assemble, I slathered with some sauce (eyeballed it), added a layer of cheese (2 slices per sandwich), then pepperoni (4 slices each) and finally the sausage, a dab more sauce (just a little...) and a dash of seasoning. I then covered each with a top layer of crescent dough to make two sandwiches. Served with Italian pasta salad (from a box - I was lazy!!!). My bf and I both agree that refrigerated pizza dough would be better suited to this kind of recipe (pizza dough "crisps" up better than crescent dough does - but we did enjoy the buttery taste of the crescent rolls). Our sandwiches were a bit soggy, but seemed to firm up somewhat after sittng on the pizza sheet for a while. Thanks for sharing this quick and easy recipe. This would be perfect for kids to help prepare (with some adult supervision, of course!).

I had high hopes for this recipe because my 4 year old loves pizza sandwiches.  It would have been good if it hadn't been for the tomato paste, which definitely ruined the whole thing by tasting too pungent.  I would use tomato sauce next time, although I think I will just opt for a more traditional recipe altogether.

This recipe was okay nothing to really rave about.  I wanted to use up the crescent rolls that I had and so for lunch I made this.  Out of the 3 kids I have only one ate it.  So probably won't make it again unless I'm in a rush for a fast lunch.

This was a good fast dinner.  I left the pizzas open face and topped them with cheese, fresh sliced tomatoes, olive oil and fresh basil-sort of a pizza margherite.  Pretty good over all.

I made these for my Mother-in-Law's birthday party last night and everyone said they were good. I used shredded Mozzarella cheese instead of slices and spaghetti sauce instead of tomato paste. I also added shredded cheddar cheese, pepperonis, browned sausage, mushrooms and cooked bacon. They turned out really well but they fell apart pretty easily. Also be sure to spray your baking sheet with Pam because they stick really badly. I'm giving this recipie 4 stars for the idea of the Pizza sandwich that I added to.

Loved the idea!  Used shredded mozarella instead of slices (what I had on hand) and jarred spaghetti sauce leftover from pasta night (I think the tomato paste would be too much anyway).  Added mushrooms as well.  Will definitely make again!

I ran out of dough while making these, so one of the sandwiches ended up open-faced. From now on I'll probably make square pizza sandwiches instead of the rectangular shaped ones. The rectangular ones are a little too large for a young child's appetite anyway. That's my only complaint though. These sandwiches are delicious! My three year old daughter loves 'em.

This was great. Easy to make and tasting good. Used pizza sauce, shredded mozzarella and added green peppers and onions. Will definitely make again!

These were really good, I might try pizza sauce next time because the tomato paste was a little too much.

My 7 year old daughter really liked making these!  She did it all by herself and was quite proud. They tasted good too.

The recipe didn't say but are you meant to cut these in half before serving them?  That's the only way you could get 4 servings from 2 rectangles, filled and covered with 2 rectangles.  It sounds like a wonderful recipe with lots of room for individual variations!
