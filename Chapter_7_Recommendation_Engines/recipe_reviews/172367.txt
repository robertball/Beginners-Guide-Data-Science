Wow. This is amazing. I used 6oz of pineapple juice, about 8oz of mango rum and 3 ounces of mango juice, no sugar and 3 scoops of vanilla ice cream (no heavy cream) This is quite possibly the best adult beverage I've ever had in my life! THANK YOU!

Oh my goodness! This was one of the best smoothies I've ever had. It was like having a slice of the tropics in my Pennsylvania backyard. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This is a great summer time, refreshing cocktail; with or without alcohol. I added some clear rum for the adults. Thanks for the recipe Godiva Goddess.

Mmmmmm-mm! The aroma of this alone is intoxicating and inviting.  Once you take that first sip you get exactly what you were signaled to expect - a rich but refreshing, creamy, pastel-colored, not too sweet drink that reminds you of a chaise lounge, pool and sunshine. I used Splenda rather than sugar and half-and-half rather than cream but beyond that, stuck to the recipe.  I generally make Hubs his preferred yogurt-based smoothies but for me today, this was a refreshing and welcome change.   Normally I might garnish this like a Pina Colada - a wedge of pineapple perhaps, a maraschino cherry and a paper umbrella of course, but this time we just slurped this up straight out of the blender, the two of us cleaning up this "4-serving" recipe in no time.  Loved it.

This was DELICIOUS! I only had 1/2 & 1/2, so I just used that instead of the heavy cream. Other than that, no changes were made, except that I topped it with whipped cream and some flaked coconut. So cool and refreshing on this hot summer day! This would be great spiked too~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Yummmmmmmm! This was so yummy! I reduced the pine apple juice quantity to 1 cup, crushed some of the ice before adding the other ingredients along with the remaining ice cubes. Finally, I topped it off with whipped cream and it tasted amazing! The taste was VERY similar to the mango pinacolada I had at a mexican restaurant!

Too much mango, but my mango was slightly under ripe, so it was sour... I cant say that I would love it with less mango...

Made this last night. It was pretty good. I really liked it. I added some frozen strawberries and still had to add more ice to make it the right texture. The smoothie wasn't too sweet but it was a good balance. I just added come whipped cream on top and that gave me the extra sweetness I was looking for

I am rating this on inspiration, not as the recipe is written.  I used a mango, forgot about the ice cubes (didn't have the recipe in front of me), omitted the sugar, used 1 1/4 cups of freshly cut pineapple, 1/2 cup soy milk, and 1/2 cup freshly made coconut milk.  It was fantastic!  It was a great start to my day!

I made this as written except I used 1% milk instead of the heavy cream and my husband and I didn't care for it. I didn't find that it had a lot of flavor. We ended up adding more pineapple juice, some canned pineapple and then even some banana to try to enhance the flavor.

Good, but needed something to add flavor. Maybe a little less ice and some rum?

Absolutely delicious!! I used frozen mango, no ice and 1% milk instead of cream. The flavor was fantasic and it was rich and creamy. :) Will probably make these one evening and add some vodka, but will Definitely be making these again as is with brunch! :)

Great Smootie!!! I used plain and vanilla yogurt instead of heavy cream.  Also I made 2 smoothies: one with coconut milk, and one with coconut water. I made them for my family and they liked the milk one much more. I personally liked the water more though. You can make this with either recipe.

I love how this is nonalcoholic, so I can enjoy it! I also love how I can change it to fit my dietary needs! I made only enough for one because I didn't have enough ingredients for two. I used two (5.46 oz.) cans of coconut milk, whatever amount of juice is in a 20 oz. can of chunk pineapple and the pineapple from that can. Thinking I may already have too much liquid, I didn't add ice cubes.thank you very much.

I usually try the recipe, rate it, and then alter it.  This time I did have to alter it simply because I had a really ripe mango that needed to be eaten or it was going to go bad.  I changed two things, I used frozen pineapple because I didn't have any juice, and I used 1/2 cup cottage cheese instead of heavy cream, since I didn't have that either.  Should have resulted in a very similar flavor though so I feel okay giving an honest review, and it was divine!  I will be making this again for sure.  I'm off to go serve it to my kids :)

My true critics (children) liked it and asked for seconds. It didn't give me a wow factor but It was still good. ( I was still full from dinner). This was my first time working with coconut milk and I loved the creamy texture. I'll definitely give this a try again. (Next time I will use a fresh Mango instead of frozen)

It just didn't taste good to me. Perhaps I made it too runny, as I have a powerful blender, but the taste was like the flavors clashing.

Amazing. Tastes EXACTLY like a virgin pina colada. Made for 2 people. CHANGES MADE: used 1 teaspoon of stevia (instead of white sugar). Omitted the cream altogether but used a full can of coconut milk. Used a whole mango. WOW!

Pretty good! We used agave and skim milk instead of sugar and heavy cream. It hit the spot on a hot day.

I used a handful of frozen mango and also added a frozen banana. It had a good, thick consistency. Maybe that's because I didn't add the heavy cream. I don't usually have that on hand, but I'd probably replace it with half-N-half or milk anyway. It was plenty sweet with only a half packet of Stevia. I'm sure a little rum would make this even better! Thanks for the recipe, Godiva Goddess!
