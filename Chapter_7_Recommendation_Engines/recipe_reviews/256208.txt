First time I made this last year it did not turn out. Since then I have made it 6 more times and gets better with more seasoning. I definitely recommend placing the cauliflower crust on Parchment paper before placing on cookie sheet. Add more seasonings (garlic powder, onion powder, turmeric, parsley and basil) and more mozzarella. I also added in a 1/4 cup peccorino romano cheese. Bake crust then put on toppings. If freezing a crust don't place toppings on until you are ready to bake and eat.

I wish I would have taken a pic it turned out so golden! This has been one of my favorite non gluten free pizza options so far. I don't need to be but the husband is  so I try  everything. Now I will continue to do this crust because it is so delicious and truly a way to save on calories for someone who loves her carbs! What I did: Birds Eye 10 frozen cauli rice cooked as directed in bag then put in strainer as recipe called for ( I didn't see anything that drained but i had left in bag unopened for awhile), added the 1 egg and alittle less mozzo and more parmesan then added garlic salt and dried minced onion. I baked in 400 convection oven until it was browned and then added my toppings -1/2 green pesto and 1/2 marinara and then chicken, artichokes, roasted tomatoes and cheese on it all then back in oven until browned and bubbly. This really is only enough for one hungry person so make a double batch! I really could make this again for tomorrow night!

The recipe is a good place to start but I had to do a few things to make it successful. 1)This recipe WILL stick to your pan, no matter how much oil you use. Use parchment paper and save yourself a lot of agony. 2)Be sure to drain, drain, drain, that cauliflower!. Extra moisture will make this crust crumble apart when you try to cut it. 3) Increased parmesan to 3 Tbsp 4) Mixed some well drained minced garlic into the dough mixture  5) Once dough was pressed out into the pan (and I pressed the dough really firmly), I took an additional egg white and brushed the top of the crust. 6)Then I LIBERALLY sprinkled italian seasoning, garlic powder, additional parmesan cheese, and a little extra salt over the top of the crust before baking. 7) Finally, I sprinkled the same items in #6 over the very top once I added the toppings. Steps 6 and 7 completely erased any trace of cauliflower flavor, which was vital for us because my son won't touch anything remotely resembling a vegetable.

This was so good I did not even make a pizza out of it. I decided just to cut the crust into slices and dip it in marinara sauce. I did use a baking stone and I put corn meal over the cooking spray, as another person suggested. I also increase the Parmesan cheese to 3 or 4 tablespoons. Finally, I baked it about five minutes longer than indicated to really brown it on top.

I added 1 t. McCormick Basil Oregano Garlic & Sea Salt Blend to the crust.  Per someone else's suggestion, I also increased the Parmesan to 1/4 C and baked this on parchment paper.  OMG, I was shocked how good this was and I do not like cauliflower on its own!

I’ve made this a few times and it’s decent as written. I’d recommend adding garlic powder, Italian seasoning, and extra Parmesan. Otherwise it’ll taste like eating plain baked cauliflower. Make sure to literally squeeze the life out of the cauliflower and get out ever last drop of moisture or it will steam instead of getting baked and crispy. I’d recommend letting it sit for 30 min or so to dry out a little more after squeezing it. Bake it longer than you think you need to before topping it. You almost have to burn the sides to get the middle crispy and baked well enough. This recipe is very basic, hence the 3 star review, but with some extra ingredients it is much better. :)

This is better than any other GF pizza crust I have tried. It's even lower in calorie than the other GF crusts to boot. ( Most GF items are higher than their regular counterparts.)  The secret is to get all the moisture out of the cauliflower. I squeezed it in paper towels. I may try coffee filters next time. I did add an Italian seasoning blend to the crust.

This is really easy to make and tastes great. I didn't miss the traditional pizza crust. I did toss in a little oregano and garlic powder and a pinch a salt just to spice it up a bit. A great low carb alternative to regular pizza crust!

I did everything as the recipe said. Use parchment paper and squeeze out the cauliflower with a a cheese cloth or clean towel. I had to squeeze mine 4 or 5 times to get all the water out. I also added a touch of breadcrumbs for texture,  garlic power , Italian seasoning and a touch of Himalayan salt for flavor. I left mine is the oven a little longer on bottom take after I put my toppings on for a crispier crust.

This was really good! I changed a few things. I added 1T of self Rising flour, salt, garlic and other Italian spices, I mixed it in a food processor and baked it on a parchment paper lined baking sheet instead of using Pam. I just put a little spaghetti sauce on it and ate it like that. I’ll be making this a lot.

We loved it! I made it as a trial for a girls get together and it was yummy! Will definitely bring. The crust held up nicely and I topped it with onions peppers a bit of pepperoni cut small and cheese, no sauce. I put a seasoning blend in the crust. I’ll make it exactly the same for my event.

I really wanted to like this recipe, but it stuck to my greased baking sheet and really had a strong cauliflower taste.
 I might try it again with 1) really extensive drying of the cauliflower after cooking it  2) parchment paper on the baking sheet  3) Italian seasoning added

My crust did not turn out very crispy or browned after 25 min; however, I was hasty and starving while making this.  I did not spend a lot of effort in squeezing the water out of the cooked cauliflower.  I did add 1 tsp of italian seasoning and some garlic powder to the crust when I mixed it up.  Overall, it was quite satisfying and after eating almost the whole pizza, there was no guilt! In my opinion this is a 1 1/2 serving recipe.  For me it made 6 slices.

This was the recipe I tried because I had Green Giant frozen riced cauliflower on hand. After reading suggestions from other cooks I definitely tweaked it. I added Italian seasoning, garlic & onion powder, pepper ( I didn't want to add salt for fear of it drawing more moisture out & preventing it from crisping which turned out to be just fine w/ added parm & spices, etc) I used one egg, more shredded mozz than the recipe calls for (eyeballed it) & threw in some shredded parm. You absolutely NEED parchment paper! I used foil that had been sprayed & while it technically worked...parchment just makes life easier. One thing I will say...next time I make this I will definitely make more of an effort to really thin it out as much as humanly possible while maintaining its form. The edges crisped up super yummy & that was what was most reminiscent of an actual carby crust. I had a few parts of it that were a lil thicker in the middle & while still tasty it would be better thinner. No idea why they suggest a colander & wasteful paper towels. You absolutely have to wrap the cooked cauliflower up in a kitchen towel & squeeze like your life depends on it. You will not believe the amount of water that comes out! I'm curious to try this with fresh cauliflower but this does the job in a pinch if you happen to have some frozen riced stuff on hand. It's not a solid base recipe but if you take the advice of others who've made it, things can work out pretty alright.

I added salt and pepper otherwise kept the recipe the same. 
Would definitely make this again!
Not having to use a food processor was amazing so that sets this recipe apart. So much easier than other cauliflower crust recipes. 
Make sure to dry the cauliflower well before mixing and baking.

I have now made this twice and we have loved it both times. Changed up my toppings and doubled the crust recipe so that I made enough for everyone. Made my tomato sauce from scratch using another AR recipe.

I added chopped garlic along with dried basil and oregano. Parchment paper is key to baking this (  I didn't even use cooking spray ) I also doubled recipe to make an extra large pizza . I recommended lining your strainer with a thin kitchen towel to really get all liquid out of cauliflower

Good! Very easy to make and yummy! I added a little bit of basil and garlic to the crust for more flavor, and I shook some cornmeal onto the pan before baking. It did stick to the pan a little bit, but was overall easy to make and clean up.
