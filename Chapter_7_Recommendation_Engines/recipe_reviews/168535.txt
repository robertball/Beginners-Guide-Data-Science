The cupcake recipe was good, although; the frosting recipe was disgusting!

These were great cupcakes! They were very moist and had a nice citrus flavor. I didnt try the frosting recipe and just stuck with a traditional lemon buttercream recipe and they turned out fantastic!

The cupcakes came out wonderfully, if a tiny bit dry. (I think I may've added too much flour.) I was looking for a cake that wasn't too sweet, and this was perfect.

I topped it with lime whipped cream, so I can't rate the frosting.

good recipe but i put orange juice instead of milk to give more citrus flavour.
