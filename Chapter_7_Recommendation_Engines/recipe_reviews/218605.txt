I created this recipe for Marianne's So. Cal Allrecipes Beach Bash. It was very well received by the Blue Cheese lovers in the group. Warning - put a sign by this saying "Savory......" Some people thought it was a sweet cheese cake with carmel drizzle. OPPS - Sorry! This can be made ahead of time and refrigerated or even frozen. I said it serves 24 but it actually would probably serve more than that. I plan to make one and freeze in smaller pieces for a elegant appetizer to take to holiday parties. Update- I used my immersion hand blender to mash up the onion fruit mixture - if you don't have one I would consider peeling the pears. Also, as you are adding the eggs to the filling - do so on a slow speed and try to not incorporate too much air. Air in the filling causes the cheesecake to crack.

This is going to be one of those reviews that drive folks nuts who don't like tinkering and reviewing. I am sorry, but I have wanted to make this for a very long time and I didn't have any event large enough to do this generous and beautiful appetizer. I decided that I would divide this to serve 6 so that I might use it for just my husband & I for Valentines Day as an app. and freeze some for drop in guests. Please forgive me Nana for deconstructing this to use in small amounts. First, I skipped the crust recipe because I decided to bake this  4 oz ramekins. To compensate for the thyme that was missing in the crust, I added it to the cheese mixture. I divided the finished cheesecake mixture between three 4 oz ramekins and baked in a water bath at 350 for 30 minutes. They puffed up beautifully. I then halved the fruit compote recipe and made as directed. I did not "frost" the cheesecakes cuz they came out beautifully. I then served the compote over the cheesecake with a sprinkle of toasted pecans and sliced baguettes for the foundation. YUMMY!!!! The beauty is that I still have two little ramekins in the freezer to pull out when I have impromptu guests or just us :) Thanks so much for sharing Baking Nana. this is impressive and delicious!
