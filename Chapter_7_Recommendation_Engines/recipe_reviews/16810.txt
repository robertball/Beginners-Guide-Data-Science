Made this last night in my extra large crock pot.  If you follow the recipe exactly it makes a huge amount of soup so be sure to use a big crock pot.  Husband loved it!  He had three big helpings.  Son (9 years old) just thought it was ok but did eat it.  I diced the carrots up really small and he didn't even notice them, he hates carrots.  When I make this again I will only use 8 cups of water instead of the 10 the recipe calls for.  We thought the soup was a little thin and we prefer a thicker version of Split Pea Soup.  Otherwise it was very yummy and I will definitely make it again!  Diced ham would be good in this soup too!

I made this with 16 oz cubed ham instead of sausage.  EXCELLENT!  I did make a few other changes after reading reviews though.  I used 8 cups of chicken broth instead of the 10 cups of water.  I also used fresh minced garlic instead of the garlic powder.  

I only added about half of the peas in the beginning...I was getting nervous around 3 hours because it didn't seem to be cooking at all!  But then about a half hour later it was really going and I added the rest of the peas, and it went for a total of about 5 hours on high.  So it came out with a nice thick pea mush with some whole pieces too.

I was a little nervous about the lack of a lot of "seasonings and spices" here...but trust the recipe and use a good quality pea and meat and the flavors will really come out where they are supposed to!  Hubby says best pea soup yet!

This was really good.  The only changes I made were:  2cans of chicken broth, instead of the bouillon cubes, therefore only 7 cups of water.  I also added 1/2 lb or cubed ham and used Cajun sausage to add flavor.  SDamare, Slidell,LA

Absolutely the best peas soup I have ever had!!!
I used 3/4 lb of italian sausage, and added a few peppers and red skin potatoes with skins.  I like the extra fiber. :-)  Thank you Dorothy for sharing this with us.

Yummy! I used turkey smoked sausage to cut the fat and this was really good. It freezes well too - I have it frozen in individual servings and have it for lunch often. Pretty easy to make too.

My husband was the one wanting a pea soup. He didn't care for this recipe until I put the soup in my blender and pureed it. It has a very good taste, with the sausage.

My husband and I like to make this recipe in the dead of winter!  We like to beef it up a little with some Tabisco and a few other spices.  We use chicken broth instead of chicken boullion cubes.  That way there is not as much salt.  Thank you for this recipe!

Amazing, even my 9 & 5 year old kids loved this. Husband went back for seconds too!!

I used 1lb of sweet Italian sausage squeezed from the casing and fried instead of the smoked sausage.  I also used 8 cups of water instead of 10 because I only have a 4qut crock pot.

I ended up cooking it on High for about 5 hours and then low another 2 because I forgot about it :) it turned out great anyways and was nice and thick and creamy.

Went great with a box of Jiffy cornbread, an effortless meal to walk in the door to!

A definite keeper, THANKS!!

Excellent Recipe!  My crock pot could not fit the last cup of water, but it came out superbly tasty and just the right thickness!  It was even better the second day!  The second time that I made this, I use two smoked hamhocks and it was exquisite!

This was fabulous!  I used the advice given by others (sort by "most helpful" under reviews).  8 cups of chicken boullion - I am a very new cook, so the canned kind.  I used real garlic cloves (3) instead of powder. I diced everything very fine and put it in.   Instead of sausage, I used a leftover ham bone I had stored in the freezer.  After 5 hours, I took out the ham bone and put everything through the blender (my kids won't eat anything that has different textures or competing colors).  I did not have potatoes so after an extensive internet search, I added instant flakes - Betty Crocker - about 1/3 cup.  It thickened the soup perfectly (I whisked the soup to get out all lumps).  Then I cut up the ham and put it in (I pick it out when I prepare a bowl for my children).  I did add salt - note for those cooking impaired - if you add salt that's not granulated, wait a few minutes for it to dissolve before adding more.  This recipe was so easy and so fabulous.  My husband LOVED it, my kids liked it (this is huge), and I felt like an expert cook.  If you are new to cooking, start here.  You will be excited to try more recipes.  Also, always sort the reveiws by "most helpful" - here you will find the tips from the expert cooks to make recipes even better.

After reading reviews about the soup being too thin. I took others advice and added only 5 cups of water and 1 cup of milk. I also added about 4 small potatoes cubed, a few chopped carrots and a whole onion. After about 4 hours, the peas had completely disinigrated so I added another half a bag and a little more water and let it cook an hour on low. Yummy! The disinigrated peas made a great base for a thick soup, while the firmer peas added some substance. I added a little extra salt and pepper at the end and this soup was amazing. The sausage gave it a great flavor and it was very filling.

Holy camoley, this soup is the business!!!! I did what the reviewers said and used 8 cups of chicken stock instead of 10 cups water and I went the extra mile and sauteed the mirepoix with veggie oil, seasoning salt and regular Mrs. Dash. The only suggestion would be to add the sausage at the last 30 minutes, maybe hour because it was a little mushy. Made this for the Bears/SeaHawks playoff game and it's been a hit with my friends and the Bears are winning! This is some lucky soup, so I will make this again if the Bears make it to the Super Bowl ;)

I had a spiral ham bone and some ham leftover from a party.  I boiled the bone down to get the meat off and used that water for the base.  Half ham water, half water so it wouldn't be too salty.  I didn't add the bouillon and skipped the sausage because of the ham.  This was excellent soup and perfect for a winter's day.  Will definitely make again!

I made this for the first time yesterday and while not bad, it was not great. I used 9 cups of water. I would make this again but I would definitely change some things, for example, more bouillon and more spices. The broth was SO bland! The peas were fine after 5 hours but everything else was too mushy, so I would add the smoked sausage and vegetables only after the split peas cooked for 2 hours. With a little tweaking, this could be a wonderful fall/winter soup!

Hearty, yummy soup.  A comfort food dish for sure. After reading reviews I also substituted 8 cups of chicken broth (2 big boxes) in place of the water and chicken bouillon cubes.  I used white potatoes and 1/2 tsp of Italian seasoning (instead of just oregano) and I added 1/2 tsp of black pepper. I also used 1lb of a bone-in ham slice that I found in my farmers market, chopped it up & put the bone in as well for extra flavor.  Cooked on high for 6 hours, came out perfectly delicious!!  Will definitely be making this one over and over again.

Very good, tasty and easy to make.  I love slow cooker recipes that go together quickly in the morning and this is one of those.  The only thing I would change is not putting quite as much water in it.  Maybe 6 - 8 cups of water instead of 10.

Very nice.

I only used 4 boulion cubes and found it was flavourful and still satly enough.  I would sugest to make sure your potatoes are choped small as they should become the thickness.  Your sausage is the most important part of the soup as it give off the most flavour. So choose wisely.

I was disappointed with this given the really good reviews. I thought it was too thin and would definitely decrease the amount of water. I also thought it was a bit bland.

I made a few changes to this recipe.  To cut down on the salt, I used two quarts of low sodium chicken broth instead of the water and chicken bouillon cubes, minced garlic not garlic powder and 1 lb. of the Boston butt my husband smoked over the weekend.  I also cooked it on low in the crock pot for 8 hours.  This soup was easy to prepare and an outstanding meal on a cold January night.

I made this soup for a St. Patty's Day party and everyone was suppose to be a green food....so it kind of started out as a joke....but hey the JOKE was on me!  This is absolutely delicious and really easy since it's a crock pot recipe.  I tried to combine some of the other suggestions in the reviews to make the best soup.  I used 2 quarts of chicken broth and boiled 3 ham shanks for about an hour last 1/2 hour I add the carrots.  I removed the ham shanks, removed the meat and poured the broth into the crockpot.  In a skillet I browned the onions, celery and fresh garlic in olive oil, then I added this to the dried peas, potatoes into the broth in the crockpot.  Cooked on low for about 6 hours.  Last 1/2 hour I browned the smoked sausage and added it and the ham to the soup.  It was the perfect consistency without blending.  Served with jalapeno corn bread.  Everyone loved it...even those who swore they didn't like Split Pea Soup! Thanks Dorothy for sharing.

This was very good!  I followed my slow cooker's instructions:  rinse the peas, cover with 2 inches of water, bring to a boil, cook for 2-3 minutes, cover, and let stand overnight.  Perfect!  My slow cooker would hold only 9 cups of water, but I think I will use 8 cups next time to make it less liquidy.  I used Healthy Choice sausage (added during the last half hour of cooking because it was pre-cooked), and 2 cloves of minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  Delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this soup exactly by the recipe. It smelled great, but looked a little watery to me. My wife had gotten a submerging blender for Chistmas, so we strained out the bay leaves and meat and let it do it's thing. It turned out thick and consistent. Thanks for the recipe.

Yummy!  I used chicken broth instead of water, and only 8 cups as suggested by others.  I also added 1/2 of a chopped up pepper and some hot sauce.

This is a good base recipe but I didn't feel it had enough herbs in it and it was definitely too runny for my taste. I also tried it with Italian Sausage and the oregano flavor was too strong. Perhaps I simply don't love oregano enough to love this recipe as is! However, over time I've modified it down to a version that my family loves!!! Everyone has several bowlfuls when I make it. I've saved a custom version of my changes for anyone interested.

VERY GOOD! I did on top of stove. Made a smaller batch for me. In a pot I covered 2 cups dry split peas & bay leaf w/water & brought to boil for 2 min. Remove from heat & cover, let sit 1 hr. Drain, added 5 cups water & used chicken base (from Costco). Sauteed carrots, celery & added to soup along w/ 1 diced potato. Brought to boil, turn down to simmer for 4 1/2 hr. (Last hour, I threw in Hillshire Farms Lil smokey TURKEY links which I cut up. I did throw in a couple whole ones). Very FLAVORFUL soup! I will make this again. Thanks alot for the recipe.

Although this soup tasted pretty good, it had a very unappetizing color and texture after sitting in the slow cooker all day, plus a layer of sausage grease on top.  My family hardly touched it.

This is a delicious and easy meal - add another bonus, inexpensive - which is why it deserves a five star review.  I've made it using both turkey sausage as well as vegan.  I just added some salt and pepper to the vegan version - and the soup was delicious, particularly on the second day.  I will make this again and again.

I thought this turned out great!  We used 1/3 - 1/2 cup of ham base instead of sausage for my veggie daughter and then when it was time to eat, just added ham cubes to my husband's and mine dishes.  Also my 5 quart crock only took 9 cups of water with the other ingredients.  I love my winter soups and this will be a permanent addition.

I used ham base in place of the chicken broth/bouillon. My incredibly picky boys begrudgingly took a nibble, ate their bowls & went back for seconds. That's worth 10 stars here. Thank you!

Very good!  I chicken stock instead of bouillon, and a half cup of barley (added toward the end) instead of the potatoes.  The smoked turked sausage was delicious in it.  My husband and daughter loved it as much as I did.  I also made it on the stove top instead of the crock pot because my power was out!  Was absolutely delicious and will make it again and again.

I followed this recipe exactly and I'm joining the ranks of the few people who gave this a low rating--everything in the soup turned out  crunchy, and the broth was without flavor.   I pureed the mixture and added salt and pepper...it has gotten better since then.

Excellent and super easy to make.  My kids loved the soup.  I make a similar soup but with red lentils and it is my kids favorite.  The only change I made was to use about 1/2 the sausage.

This was an awesome Receipe ~ I too modified it with Ham, used two cans of chicken broth and water to make 8 cups and no bullion.  I got nervous that it was not thickening but it came through.  My husband said it was the best ever - he never compliments my cooking ;0}

This turned out wonderfully!  Used leftover ham instead of the sausage, 8 cups of water as suggested in previous reviews with two large boullion cubes quartered and substituted oregano (none on hand) with italian seasoning.  Tossed in some peppercorns as well.  Set on low for 8 hours in the crock and came home to dinner..Thank you for the recipe :)

Sorry, I'm going to have to agree with the minority on this one. I was really looking forward to tasting this, but when it came down to it, I didn't like it... in particular, I didn't like the addition of the oregano... in my opinion, it was overpowered the other flavors. Also, I cut back the water to 8 cups as others suggested and thought it was still too watery so I mixed in some steamed rice to thicken it up.

This  soup has a wonderful combination of flavors.  It filled the kitchen with a tantalizing aroma.  I used light, smoked turkey sausage (polska kielbasa).  Do skim the fat from the top before serving.

Let me start by saying we loved this soup and it was even better the NEXT day, but I did make some changes. First, I only used about 5 cups of organic chicken broth which I think makes all the difference in the world. It's richer, bolder flavor adds to the soup in ways powdery bouillon simply cannot. I also used fresh garlic and skinless turkey sausage. The split peas I used cooked down until they were smashed to a pulp creating a very traditional pea soup in just over 5 hours.

This rating is based on the soup that I made, and made the following tweeks:
1.) Instead of using bouillon cubes, I used 5 cups chicken broth, and 5 cups water
2.) I omitted the sausage and potatoes so there were less calories
3.) Spices - I added also: onion powder, celery salt, black pepper & white pepper
4) I cooked it in the crock pot a little longer, and it came out creamy, and there was no need for a blender!
It was really amazing; as good or better than any restaurant!! The leftovers are even better because the soup thickens up a bit

I love this soup.  Sometimes it turns out a little too thick so I do check on it towards the end to check the consistancy.  I use some milk, besides water or chicken broth.  Its good without so many of the extra veggies listed, too.

Judging by all the positive reviews, maybe I did something wrong. I used kielbasa. The kitchen smelled to high heaven. The beans and the potatoes never softened, even though I cooked them on high for six hours.

wow! A friend mentioned making split pea soup and I came to the realization I'd never tried it. And that was only because I thought it kind of looked gross. I thought it was time I tried it. I had a bunch of smoked sausage in the fridge so I chose this recipe. I'm glad I did. It was so flavorful! My whole family enjoyed it. Wow!

First split pea soup I've made that tasted good. (It was a curse, not sure why I couldn't do it in a regular soup pot, I just messed it up several times before). Thanks for a quick and easy recipe! We used turkey sausage and broth instead of bullion. This is WELL worth making a day ahead- it only gets better the next day.

This was good! I used boxed chicken broth instead of boullion and water. The peas didn't hold their shape which made it a thick soup but the flavor was very good.

I REALLY hate to do this but I cannot possibly give this a better rating. I read all of the other reviews VERY carefully and used broth instead of cubes and WAY less water. If you would have used the water it called for I can't even imagine how watery it would be? I also had to add a lot more seasoning and however the taste was good in the end, it came out very thin and their were no peas left but only a few clumps of green mush. I won't even go into how I tried to remedy it but it didn't work either. I really don't know what to say except one would have to use just a few cups of broth only, more seasoning, and alot less cooking time for it to come out okay? I was anxious to try this and had been planning it for weeks and I am very sorry I had to rate so poorly.

This soup is AWESOME! I followed the recipe,with the exception of using a 16 oz. package of ham, instead of sausage and  only 7 cups of chicken broth instead of water. My 6-year old LOVED IT!! The perfect consistancy, stayed on the spoon so less mess for me to clean up! Will make again & again, Thank you!

Yummy!! So easy. I wish I would have added the sausage half way through. By the time it was done cooking they were kind of mushy.

Good recipe and very easy. There is no way however that I could fit 10 cups of water and all of those vegetables in my 6qt slow cooker. I ended up using 8 cups of water and added an extra bouillon cube for more flavor. I used Kielbasa for my sausage and I feel like it lost a lot of it's flavor through the process. Next time I may try a spicy sausage.

Way too much water! I followed the recipe exactly, and at the end of 6 hours on high I had a thin soup I could see through. I added another half a pound of peas and cooked it another 1.5 hours on high and ended up with a very good split pea soup, with a medium consitency. Be aware that this makes a ton of good cheap soup, my family of three could have easily cut the original recipe in half and still had leftovers.

Like many others suggested, this was pretty good but needed some modifications to be to my family's liking.  Instead of using bullion cubes and 10 cups of water, I used six cups of chicken stock and four cups of water.  I omitted the celery just because I didn't think it would add much of anything to the soup.  I added quite a bit of sea salt to taste, as it definitely needed some more flavor beyond what the recipe calls for.  After cooking in the crock pot for about six hours, the soup was too watery for our tastes.  I added an entire second bag of dried peas, (a 1 lb. bag) and let that cook in for another couple hours.  Then the soup ended up being a little bit too thick, so I added two more cups of chicken stock to smooth it out.  Finally it was just right!  I think next time I make this I'll cook it for the first six hours with four cups water and four cups chicken stock, then add the second pound of peas and the last two cups of stock at the end.  I like how this added to the texture of the soup by having that thick pea soup base that we like, but still having a chunky texture with the second bag of peas and the other veggies and sausage.  If you like thick, chunky soups, you'll probably like those modifications as well.  :)

While I am not a fan of Split pea soup, I know other people are so I made this for a teacher luncheon at my son's school. It was really easy to prepare and even I thought it smelled good. The reviews from the teachers were A+!!! Several have since asked me for the recipe!!!

Excellent.  I used 6 cups Chicken Broth instead of water & cube flavouring.  Cooked on high 5 hours and low 2 hours. Hubby asbsolutely LOVED IT !!!  And he is French Canadian and is very PASSIONATE about his pea soups.  This was my 1st attempt, and the 2nd batch is already on the go as I'm typing. AAA+++  all the way :-)

I loved this recipe. It was very easy to prepare, and using sausage instead of the usual ham hocks was a flavorful change from normal split pea soup, not to mention easier than having to cut the hot ham off the bone like I usually do. I would recommend it for its great flavor and ease of preparation.

This is great.  I'm a vegetarian, so I left out the sausage and used Morning Star Farm breakfast links, and it was great.  (I also skipped the celery). I was in a time crunch, so I cooked it on the stove for about 45 minutes.  Got rave reviews from my guests!

I made this with a smoked ham shank and even though I halved the recipe (too much for two) I used a full 1lb shank. I also used chicken broth.It came out really well but I have to add that like a lot of soups/stews this comes out better if you wait and 
reheat the next day (I cooked this on low and added some water since it was getting too thick). Very easy to prep. No need to add any salt (or very little) since the ham gives off a lot of salt naturally.

This is the best split pea soup I have ever made.  I used Spicy Italian sausage.  In my chopper I chopped on one leek and baby carrots and garlic.  I used chicken broth instead of water.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

This soup was superb! We made it exactly like the recipe, changing only using 10 cups of chicken broth instead of bouillon and used chopped garlic instead of the powder. What a great recipe!

Used ham and put it not the pot at the very end as trying to keep down the fat. Blended first with hand held boat motor (as we call it)

This just did not turn out.  I was so disappointed.  I did everything as written but used 8 cups chicken broth instead of 10 cups of water and used chopped ham instead of sausage.  After 7 hours on high the peas were still hard and the soup was watery.  I ended up putting it on low OVERNIGHT and still woke up to hard peas.  Then I threw it all in a pot and cooked it on high for a while and the peas finally broke down, but sadly it still did not taste good.  I really wanted this to be a good one, I'm sorry for the poor review, but the whole giant pot of soup wasn't edible after a day and a half of cooking.

I really liked the potatoes in the soup. I used the chicken broth as others suggested and cooked it on low instead of high since I have a job to go to all day. I spaced on the sausage but it was still good without it.

I loved split pea soup as a kid but had not eaten it in years, largely because my adult palate is no longer satisfied by canned soups.  This recipe was perfect!  Up until the last hour or so of cooking I was skeptical, because the peas still looked solid in the crockpot, but then the 5 hours were up, and I was thrilled to find the soup had turned into exactly what I remembered loving as a child, only better, because it was homemade!  Rave reviews from my friends as well.

yummy yummy! Great on those chilly evenings. Very good with cornbread. Must try this one. Except I used ground sausage and browned that then threw it into the soup. I also let the peas get so soft they almost were liquefied. But the 2nd time I made it I didnt let the peas get near soft enough and it wasnt so great then.

First split pea soup I ever made! For seasoning, I added a touch of marjoram and tarragon.  In stead of the sausage, used diced ham and a ham bone from Thanksgiving.  In stead of the bouillon and the water, I used 6 cups of chicken broth. Hour six of "low" setting on crock pot made it perfect!

Excellent!  I followed the directions except I used chicken broth instead of the water. I used 8 cups per reviews that said it might be too thin. Mine was not. Very creamy and delicious. I cooked on high in my slow cooker for 6 plus hours. Thanks for the recipe.

I've made this soup a couple of times.  The first time with sausage and the second time with ham.  We definitely prefer this with the ham!  The sausage wasn't bad just not what I am used to in a split pea soup.  I use an immersion blender to puree the soup so that the soup gets nice and thick, which is how we prefer it.  The soup looks runny with the diced veggies floating in the broth at the end of the cooking time so instead of adding flour or cornstarch to the pot I puree it to the thickness we like.  This is wonderful on a cold winter night with hot crusty french bread and butter, plus it's a yummy way to use up leftover ham.

Wow, this recipe was fabulous!  I placed my leftover ham bone in the pot to cook w/everything, and at the end of the day I took the ham bone out, pulled off the remaing ham and returned the ham to the pot.  I also took out all the chunks (all the veggies), minus the sausage and ham, and blended in a blender, added it back to the soup and mixed it in w/the liquid and ham & sausage.  Oh, also used 4 cups chicken broth and 6 cups water.  Heavenly, and absolutely filling.  My kids both LOVED this meal!!!

This recipe is so easy!  I had never made split pea soup from scratch before.  I made a half batch, but ended up adding a half pound more of split peas, as we like a thick split pea soup.  It cooked up perfectly in the crockpot on high for 4 hours.  I used smoked sausage, and the vegetables and seasonings as stated in the recipe for 4 servings; it had great flavor.  I look forward to making this again!

Love it.  I have never had split pea soup.  I had my dad taste test it to see how it would compare to others.  He said it was the best he has ever had.  A keeper.  Thanks.

This is tonight's dinner, along with store-bought dinner rolls. DELICIOUS. I am glad I read the reviews. I used one 49 1/2 oz can and one 14 1/2 oz can of chicken broth. I didn't change anything else, other than not paring the red potatoes because I like the color. Really good. It could have been a bit thicker, even, so next time I'll just use the 49 1/2 oz can of chicken broth, or maybe try vegetable. YUMMY!!!

I was looking for something new to do with smoked sausage and just happened to have some split peas too. It tasted wonderful even though I left out the carrots. Thanks!

I used smokies for the sausage and added some hot suace. Also 6 cups of water is more than enough if you like your soup thick. Turned out fantastic. It freezes well and tastes even better the second day. Thanks for the recipe

I love this soup! No one at my house would eat it so I brought it to work with mixed reviews. The only thing I didn't have was bay leaves. I also followed other reviews and only used 8 cups water. Perfect! This is a keeper.

A very good soup. I added a little bit of potato flakes to thicken it. However I still like the split pea soup atu recipe on this site a little better.

Excellent.  I used a Cajun seasoned sausage which added a nice kick, also used 8 cups chicken broth instead of the water/bullion combo.  Husband and 10 yr old son gave high ratings on this recipe.

I wanted a recipe that I could use the leftover ham and bone from a spiral cut ham.  I cooked the ham and bone first in the crockpot for 4 hours, removed the meat and bone, and added all of the other ingredients, then added the meat back and cooked for another 4-5 hours.  So good and even better the following days.  Because I used a sweet ham it was not salty at all.

I made this with a smoked turkey drumstick from our local Renaissance Festival instead of the sausage.  I pulled a lot of the meat off and put in the frig to add after everything cooked in the crock pot. I put the leg with meat remnants into the crock pot for flavor and removed after about 5 hours then I added the meat from the frig.  I was going from memory and forgot the bay leaves and oregano, but added salt and pepper. I used 8 cups of water and a crushed clove of garlic instead of garlic powder.  I served this with a loaf of crusty u-bake bread.  Fantastic!  Brought back memories of my grandma's split pea soup. Perfect for a rainy Sunday after spending Saturday at the Renaissance Festival!

This turned out ok; alot better than canned soup! But I wish I'd read the reviews beforehand. I would have known to add less water. Will keep the recipe though to tweak it a little.

I make this with ground turkey (browned) instead of sausage. First time was out of necessity (that was all I had), now I only make it that way - healthier and still delicious. Husband loves it, too. This soup has definitely become part of my standard slow cooker dinners.

excellent. My only problem was that the ham steak I added tasted like nothing at the end. I think next time I'll add it near the end of cooking or try the sausage.

Awesome soup! My husband who doesn't like soups at all ate double portion! I added ham instead of sausage, cook 4.5h on high in 7lb slow cooker. Then, I added a Wondra to make it thicker, 3 fresh rosemary, lots of pepper, and a little bit of basil, and cook for another hour on medium setting. Delicious!

I used cooked bacon because I thought I had some sausage in the freezer and I didn't. Turned out tasty. DO NOT add bacon before cooking and not till the end or it will be mushy bacon. To get the good bacon flavor while it cooked I added 3 tablespoons of bacon grease. Once again the texture on this was thinner than I like so I added potato flakes about 30 min before serving and it thickened nicely and tasted great.

A wonderful recipe!  Instead of using sausage, I used a ham bone from the local Honey Baked ham store.  I also used five cloves of minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  I also added some fresh black pepper.  I cooked this on the slow cooker at a low setting for 8 hours.  When it was done, the entire first floor had this nice aroma.  Then I ate it and thought I died and went to heaven.  Will be making this again.

I love this recipe! Yum Yum! 

It needs a few changes:
Use 7 cups of liquid. I did 4 of chicken broth and 3 water (Thanks to who ever suggested this)
I also doubled the garlic and oregano
I added salt and pepper to taste
I slow cooked for 8 hours.

If you cook it like this it is amazing!!

Love the soup! It's perfect for a chilly winter day. Though I cooked it on high for five hours and it still wasn't done, so I put it on low overnight. I also put about half the soup in the blender (without the sausage) to give it a nice texture.

SOOOO good!!  I used smoked turkey sausage to cut back on fat a little.  I was ready to use my immersion blender to make it creamy but I didn't need to.  It was creamy with chunks of potatoes, the taste of the sausage.  WONDERFUL!  Great with tuna sandwiches for an end to a busy day and cold evening!

I guess this is a recipe where the meat is essential. I made it without the sausage and didn't care too much for it. I had to add a lot of spices to combat the blandness.

I typically use 7 cups of liquid (4 cups chicken broth, 3 cups water) to get the thicker consistency that I prefer. If it comes out too thin for your tastes, you can always thicken it up quickly with some instant mashed potatoes flakes.

I really enjoyed the simplicity and flavor of this recipe.  However, the cooking time is way off.  I checked this after 5 1/2 hours high, and the peas were still crunchy.  Don't know about you, but I like my split peas completely cooked and on the mushy side.  I served after seven hours on high, and truthfully, I would have liked to let this go at least another hour.  I have a newer crockpot, and it runs hot.  I did use chicken broth in place of the bouillon/water, and added some minced garlic and celery seed, black pepper to the mix.  Tasty recipe, just let it go all day and you will be fine :) Loved the addition of smoked sausage, gives the soup great flavor.  Thanks for shaing this, I enjoyed trying your recipe.

Use a flavorful sausage or maybe bacon for more flavor!

Very Good, but if you like a thick Pea Soup, cut water by 1-2 cups. However, soup will thicken slightly by the next day even if made as written. I used ham instead of smoked sausage.

Very tasty and easy to make.  I will need a bigger slow cooker for sure.  I plan on making this in the future in a dutch oven for camping.  Perfect for Fall camping.

I admit that I was a bit leery to "follow the recipe exactly as presented"....concerned about how much flavor there would be--but this soup is GREAT!  OK, I couldn't  follow it exactly...mostly due to personal preferences or what I had on hand.  I substituted 8 cups of chicken stock for the water and bouillon. Added a few more carrots, celery and tatos as hubby loves his veggies.  Substituted 8 minced cloves of garlic for the powder.  Used left over ham steak from breakfast plus 1lb of smoked sausage.  Sprinkled in a little Mrs. Dashes Southwest Chipolte for some zing.  Before serving I removed a few cups of soup (along with some veggies--tried not to take the meat) put it into my vita-mix and pureed; adding back to soup to make it a little smoother and thicker....which once cooled it is thick!  Next morning I'm making another batch to send back to school with our son.  Imagine I'll be making more tonight for freezing. This soup is fabulous.  Plenty of flavor!  Thank you Dorothy for sharing!

I made this with beef smoked sausage, 3 cups of chicken broth, and 6 cups of water-and it was WAY too much liquid. It also didn't have any flavor! I cooked it longer to try to boil out the liquid and it ended up making the peas disappear-so we were eating pea-colored watery soup with no flavor. I was really disappointed, but my husband and mom liked it as is for some reason. I liked how easy the recipe was, but if I try it again, I'll use less liquids, less potato, and add some extra spices-or even just salt and pepper.

This soup was so good!  I used 8 cups chicken broth, rather than 10 of water & bouillon.  I skipped the celery and used ham hocks rather than sausage.  Used 2 cloves fresh minced garlic rather than the garlic powder.  Also used 1/2 tsp thyme rather than oregano.  Used pepper to taste.  No salt was needed.  I guess I made more changes than I realized, but this recipe was a great starting point.  I served the soup with garlic croutons.  Delicious!  Thanks for sharing. A nice easy meal for a cold winter night.

This was delicious!  I agree with luv2cook in that it was ten times better later!  I froze the leftovers and when I thawed and ate later it was amazing!  I did half sausage and half ham cubes, which I think gave it even more flavor.

After having Dutch split pea soup, I wanted to replicate the stick-to-your-ribs goodness I had in Amsterdam...boy did this recipe do the trick!  It was so easy too!  I only had half a pound of split peas, but I used about 9 cups of water, added 3 ribs celery, 2 carrots, and 1 onion, and 1 potato chopped.  I also added sliced kielbasa and about a quarter of a pound of a virginia ham deli end (the ones they sell cheap when the deli can't slice anymore).  I think the added meat added to the flavor, which was very hearty.  I thought it was still a bit soupy, so I thickened it with some tapioca flour, and then it was perfect.  Everyone loved it. As with most soups, it was even better the next day!  Even the 16 month old baby in the house approves!

I made this on Wednesday and forgot to review, this was a great soup. Easy and a one pot meal. I did decrease the liquid to 8c. and used fat free/low sodium chix broth instead of the water and boullion. I also used turkey kielbasa. My only issue with this soup was that it was not thick enough even with decreasing the liquid. I like my split pea soup thick, so I transferred the soup to my stock pot and reduced it down on the stove until it was the consistancy I liked. Other than that, great tasting soup!

I printed this out for everyone in the office. I used chicken stock and eyeballed everything. I used turkey kielbasa because it was buy 1 get 2 free and I cooked it on low for 10 hours becuause I set it in the morning and went to work. It was delicious (my husband had 3 bowls!) nutritious, and cheap to make! Thank you so much for this recipe

After cooking on high for 5 hours, the peas were still hard, so it was a water and dried split pea soup.  I left it on high for the rest of the night and went back to put it away 4 hours later, and it was cooked all the way.  Now i put it on in the morning and its perfect by the time we get home.

THIS WAS THE BEST!!! I have tried many split pea soup recipes before and have never had one with such flavor. I did as others did and cut back on the water and used 1 can of chicken broth in place of one cup of water. Otherwise followed it to the letter and it was fabulous!

I started this soup out in the slow cooker but threw it into the stock pot when it was taking its sweet time after 4 hours on high.  I put a little more peas in because I love thick pea soup and I used 2 cloves of garlic instead of powder and it was just fine.  My husband loved this soup too, it will become a regular appearance on our menu.

great flavor! I too was in a hurry and did not read the reviews that mentioned using less water. I was able to fix it by pureeing 1/3 of the soup (remove the sausage first!). Thanks for the recipe!

Good soup with a few changes to suit our tastes. I used chicken stock in lieu of the water and instead of the smoked sausage I took Italian sausage out of the casings, browned, drained and added to the soup. Delicious and thanks!

Found this quickly and so didn't read reviews otherwise would have used less water, even making it, it seems too much so used 1 cup less and it was too thin, I like thick pea soup.  But flavor was really terrific and my husband just about ate the batch in one sitting.  Will make again with more beans or less water and cook a little longer.

This recipe was great!!  I made the soup for 4 servings and took the advice of others and eliminated some of the water.  (4 servings called for 5 cups of water and I used 3 cups). It was great to come up from work and have HOT soup. This is a keeper!  Thanks for sharing your recipe Dorothy!

Pretty good recipe, but I also agree with the "too watery" comments...and I only used 8 cups of liquid (6 cups water + 2 cups chicken broth).  I'll make this again because it's easy and flavorful, but I kept it in the slow cooker for 11 hours on low and I'll use maybe 6 cups of liquid in the future (I like thick soup without much broth).

This recipe was soo disapointing. The ingredients sounded great and I put it together exactly as told. However, when it was done I had this watery layer on the top and it smelled absolutely horrible. What a waste of ingredients!

This soup was wonderful.  Well at least to me.  I think it was too "veggie" for my carnivorous husband despite the sausage.  I did add 1 tsbp dissolved cornstarch to thicken within the last hour of cooking.  Closer to the end I removed 2 cups and pureed them in the blender as others did to give it a really thick & hearty consistency.  I used approx. 12 oz. smoked sausage instead of a full pound to avoid a strong sausage taste.  It reheated well, although the appearance was odd to my co-workers, but they all said it smelled wonderful.  I froze the leftovers and intend on finishing it soon as we enter the really cold months!!  I'm very fuss-free so I could not give it 5 stars due to the fact that I had to transfer & puree a portion.  Other than that, will definitely make again for a more veggie friendly crowd.

I was amazed at this soup!  I didn't think a soup that didn't brown the onions and carrots slowly first would have such a complex and delicious flavor.  This is a new favorite easy recipe for me.  I removed the sausages and pureed the soup at the end for a thicker consistency, then put the sausage back in to serve.  Wonderful!

This recipe tastes very good when first prepared.  But don't make too much, because the sausage overpowers the soup when reheated.  I would make again, but I'd cut down the quantity!

This tasted different than what I expected.  The sausage kind of overpowered the soup.  It definitely helps to add about 2 cups of pureed soup to the pot before serving.  It helps smooth out the flavor. If I crave split pea soup again, I'll probably try a different recipe before this one.

I halved the recipe for a 2.5 quart cooker, and it came out a little thin for our taste.  I thickened it with 2 tablespoons cornstarch, and it was wonderful.

Used the suggestion of using 8 cups of liquid and I used chicken broth and the consistency was perfect for us. I also used spicy turkey sausage that I baked in the oven first and that gave it a kick. I did not have potatoes to put in but it was fine without them. Will definitely make again!

We did a slightly vegetarian version and loved it. Cut out the sausage. Didn't have celery so didn't include that either. Then we cut the water from 10-cups to 7 and cut the bouillon from 5 to 3. It was still on the salty side but it blended up so nicely. Thicker and creamier than the 10-cup version...and delicious.

I used this as a base recipe.  Had a late start on dinner so did not soak the beans. Just put them in with a mixture of water, chicken broth and a couple of boullion cubes plus chopped onion.  Only started with about 6 cups of liquid but did add more along the way for a total of about 8-9 cups.  After about 30 minutes, I added 4 chopped carrots and 32 celery stalks chopped.  Also added some oregano, marjoram, pepper.  Simmered for another 30 minutes or so adding liquid as needed.  This does tend to stick to the bottom of the pan and burn so stir frequently as it thickens up.  Added 3 cut up smoked apple/chicken sausages about 10 minutes before finished.  Add a splash of sherry to the soup on serving and stir for a little extra flavor.  Served with soda bread.  Excellent!!

Meh... both my boyfriend and I were craving really great split pea soup. The first time I made this I added some extra spices-big mistake, not required at all.
Following the recipe exactly I had a better outcome but I don't like that the soup settles the way it does and feel like it isn't quite what I was looking for.
3 stars for health value and ok taste but nothing to write home about.

This was AWESOME!  I halved the recipe because there are only two of us.  I also used chicken broth rather than going the bouillon route because I happened to have some in the fridge.  I actually ate two bowls full of this stuff.  Sooooo good!.  This brought back great memories of when my dad made erwtensoep.

I had a hankering for split pea soup and used the above recipe for my crockpot.  I had a hamsteak with a bone which I chopped up and used about a cup full in the recipe.  I used homemade chicken broth instead of bouillon cubes because I had it on hand.  After turning the crockpot off, I took out the bayleaf, and let it cool down  and placed in the fridge.  The next day I pureed it in the blender.  This split pea soup is very very good!  Thanks for the recipe!

Wow, I love this soup!  I followed the recipe, the only change being that I used ham instead of sausage.  When it was done I removed the cubed ham, pureed the soup, then added the ham back in.  It had a creamy texture and was just right with salt and spices.

I agree with the other reviews that this makes a lot of soup.  Mine was filled to the brim.

Ok taste (good base for a pea soup...), but too watery. Not a great consistency. Next time less water and some kind of thickener (and maybe more potato too) would help next time. Also, bacon was mushy. Next time I will use the drippings and crumble the bacon on top.

This is the only way I made Split Pea Soup now.  Making it in the crockpot is not only easy and economical, but it's healthier than canned because I control what's in it.  I don't add meat to the recipe, but my daughter likes to serve hers with bits of cooked ham.  I pop my immersion (stick) blender right into the crock pot after it cools a bit, and blend til smooth.  Delicious!  I also freeze it in single serving containers to enjoy later.

GREAT soup!  I left out the celery, used minced garlic and reduced the water to eight cups.  After having it for dinner tonight, I decided to puree the soup (except for the sausage) because we prefer a creamier pea soup.  We had it with "Sweet Corn Bread" from this website.

Very nice.  I adjusted it a bit bc I didn't have sausage, so I used crumbled bacon instead.  No celery either, so I added celery salt and a ham soup base packet that came out of a ham bean mix.  I used 1 can of chicken broth and 2 cups of water with a bullion cube (I halved the recipe and left out a cup of water).  It turned out a tad salty (I forgot about the salt from the bacon) but still edible, and the peas, if you cook them this way, really thicken the soup and kind of melt into it.  I added the bacon later but added all the veggies in at the same time and didn't think they were mushy at all even though I forgot about it and left it on low a lot longer than directed.  I thought a half batch of this was great; enough for two big bowls of soup for bf and my dinner and a healthy portion of soup for lunch tomorrow.  This is a really hearty soup and was a good dinner with a couple of rolls.  Thanks for the recipe!

I changed the recipe a bit.  
Left out bullion, celery, orgeano, bay leaves.
1 tsp each of garlic powder, onion powder, Mrs Dash, salt, 1/2 tsp black pepper.
Going to put the potatos, onions, carrots, in the blender next time, easier cleanup and faster.
Used Kielbasa, and this was possibly the best pea soup I have ever tasted.  
I don't find that broth or bouillilon add to the flavor of anything I cook, so started leaving them out and find the flavor improved on everything.

Very good. I used a 2.5 quart crock pot and halved the recipe but it was overflowing. I substituted ham for the smoked sausage. IT ended up a little too overcooked (all the peas turned to mush) so I would turn down the temp a little.

This was really good. I used 8 cups of chicken broth, cooked it with the ham bone and then added ham at the end instead of sausage. The soup was really thick and the peas didn't cook very well so I put it all in the blender and it came out perfect. It was delicious and better that way! Will definately make again.

I really enjoyed this soup. As is I give this a 4 but it does have 5 star potential. I did add a little Goya seasoning salt which did help wake up the broth. Next time I make it (there definitely will be next time :)) I will add the sausage maybe an hour or less before the soup is done because I found the sausage lost a lot of it's flavor.

Great Soup! Next time I will use either a cup or two less water or most likely keep it the same and use a bag and a half of peas and two sausages. It was very good and so easy.

I got raised eybrows from people who were expecting ham instead of sausage but its the same animal - right??  I used brats that I had gotten on sale.  It turned out great and honestly would be even better with the ham which I will try next time!

Delicious!  I agree with previous reviewers to only use 8 cups of water otherwise this soup will be too thin.

This soup was very delicious! I made a half-recipe, used vegetable stock instead of water and bouillon and omitted the potato since I didn't have one. Also used turkey kielbasa and a little bit of thyme. I had never had split pea soup before and now I am a convert! Yum!!

Great Flavor! I also used 8 cups of chx broth instead of bouillon and water, however it was still a bit on the runny side after 6 hours on high in the crockpot. I used a stick blender and it evened out the consistancy. Delicious w beef sausage!

Super easy and super fast!  Added one sweet potato, but otherwise followed recipe exactly using a little less chicken stock instead of water because of the size of my crock pot.  Big hit in this house!

This soup was great! I had never made split pea soup before, but I was having a craving and had all the ingredients for this recipe already! Following others advice, I used less water. I also added some salt, because I used homemade chicken broth. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. I did make it on the stove, and I was worried for the first hour that maybe it would be very thin, but it began to thicken up and the end result was a delicious, thick, smoky split pea soup. I froze about half of the recipe and it freezes very well. A keeper for my next split pea craving!

YUM!!  I did 4 cups chicken broth, 4 cups of water, 2 bouillon cubes & threw in an extra potato and used minced garlic instead of powder....so good.  I think this will be replacing my old favorite pea soup recipe.

Really a perfect recipe.  I used 8 cups (or whatever fit in my crockpot - probably more like 6) of low sodium chicken broth instead of bouillon and water.  I also used sweet potato because we like them more.  And it came out thick and perfect.  This recipe is a keeper!

I modified into a vegetarian version by leaving out the sausage.  I also replaced the potato with sweet potato.  Who knew pea soup could be so simple and delicious!?

Five stars for this one. Ummm Ummm tasty! What I did was add sweet potatoes instead of white potatoes and smoked ham instead of sausage. And I used home made chicken broth along with salt and fresh pepper to taste. My lady love it and thats what I'm taking about eh!

This was delicious!  By the time I got home, it had cooked 6 hrs and that seemed like a perfect amount of time.  I used 10 cups of chicken broth instead of water + bouillon.  I also was too lazy to cut up an onion, so I put 1 1/2-2 tsp of onion powder in instead.  I used italian seasoning in place of the oregano.  I will definitely make this again.

This was good and really simple.  As suggested, I used 8 cups of chicken broth vs. the 10 cups of water and bullion.  I think this was a wise choice, as it was the perfect consistency.  My only complaint with the recipe was that I felt it was missing a bit of spice.  The original recipe was a little "flat" tasting.  This was an easy fix by adding some salt, black pepper, white pepper and cayenne pepper.  As you can tell I like ALOT of spice so this certainly doesn't apply to everyone.  All in all it is a good recipe and one can easily adjust the seasoning to thier desire.  I will definatley be making it again.

I gave this 4 stars as I modified this dish, instead of sausage, I used cut up ham, (as suggested in another review,) And instead of water and chicken boullion, I used chicken broth (also suggested in another review.)  All else was the same as the recipe, it was awesome and I will definitely will make again... Kudos.

Thanks for this great recipe!  I used a pound of red lentils and Andoille sausage (which I pre sauteed).  I also omitted the bouillon cubes and added my own salt and pepper to taste - so I could control most of the soduim in the recipe (except for the sausage, of course)!  Will use this again!

I will definitely make this again; it was WONDERFUL. I followed previous reviews and used 6 cups of chicken broth and 1 cup of water, rather than the chicken bouillon and 10 cups of water. I kept everything else the same and had no regrets.

Very good! I did make a few changes though.  I omitted the celery, bay leaf and sausage and used leftover diced ham from Thanksgiving and cooked with the ham bone.  I also halved the recipe and threw half of the finished soup in the blender to thicken it up before serving.  A little salt and pepper before serving and it was delicious!

I had never made split pea soup before and this recipe turned out great!! I did make some changes and used honey baked ham instead of smoked sausage. Also used 6 cups of chicken broth and 4 cups of water. Make sure you dont over cook it or it will be too thick

Wow! What a great hearty winter soup. I also used chicken broth instead of the bouillon cubes, and accidentally left out the celery. This is so good. Highly recommended.

This was really good. Pretty much stuck to the recipe. Only used 8 cups of liquid (4c chicken broth, 4c water). Used minced garlic, and cubed some ham and left over kielbasa. Thanks.

had some left over ham & substituted for the sausage, I omitted the carrots b/c I'm not a fan. I cooked in the crockpot for 6 hours & still had puree w/a hand blender, turned out fantastic! I used red potatoes & kept the skin on, had enough to freeze to enjoy later during the colder months- this is a keeper!

If this would have had one or two more boullion cubes and maybe a little less water (half cup or so) it would have been perfect. It needed just a little more flavor and was a tad on the thin side. I will make this again with these changes.

UPDATE: I used one less cup of water and three more boullion cubes and it was perfect!

I need a recipe to get me started on making split pea soup the first time and this was a good choice. I upped the oregano by quite a bit and added additional seasoning to suit my tastes. I've got leftovers in the freezer and will be enjoying this again in a few weeks.   When I make it next, I am planning to use a mushroom broth for at least a portion of the liquid to try and get a bit more depth of flavor.

I would give this recipe four stars the first day, but if you can wait until day two, it is definitely a five star split pea soup recipe!! I seasoned my finished soup with salt and pepper. I will make this again, especially because it doesn’t require a ham bone and I usually have all the ingredients already in my kitchen.

We did not care for the sausage in this recipe. I think that might be because we have become used to eating foods that aren't cured. There was just a funky aftertaste. And the sausgae got a little mushy. Otherwise, the soup itself would have tasted fine.

This is great! My husband loved it too. The only thing I changed was using chicken soup base instead of boullion, and mashing things a little at the end to make it a bit thicker.

This was "okay..." It was a little "mealy" for my tastes, but then I'm not too experienced with split peas. Kids ate it, picky son said "it was good, I give it 4-1/2 stars."

Delicious! I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and used only 8 cups of water. We LOVED it! I'm not really a soup person, but it was hearty and I didn't feel like I needed a sandwich to make the meal. It makes a ton, so we froze half.

I actually left out the sausage- but I added cooked 'til crisp turkey bacon for the salty flavor.  I reserved about 1/2 cup of split peas and put them in half way through cooking so that I would have some more chunks of peas in it.  The thing is do not over cook this or it will end up verrry thick! Yummy!!!!

I thought it was good and so did my kids. But it tasted much better 1-2 days after once the flavors settled. So make ahead of time.

The soup is absolutely wonderful.  Very flavorful.  I used ham instead of sausage and used chicken broth instead of cubes.  I recommend using only 8 cups of fluid if you like a thicker soup.

Excellent split pea soup.  I used 4 cups chicken broth, 4.5 cups water, and 3 bouillon cubes.  I used fresh garlic rather than powder.  I found it was a little watery (for my taste) at the 4th hour, so I added a bit of cornstarch (about 2 tablespoons in cold water), and it turned out great.  Thanks a lot!

The flavor was very good here, but I ended up with a very watery soup with floating peas. I like a much thicker soup, so I added a bunch of red lentils to thicken it up. Next time, I will boil it, as that creates a thicker soup.

This recipe caught our eye, but the friends visiting us were vegetarian, so we made changes to this to accomodate them since we still wanted to try it. We got some fancy vegan sausage, but otherwise tried to keep things close. It really turned out super. While I can't wait to try this again with real sausage, it really turned out well with the vegetarian stuff as well.

I made this and switched half the water with chicken broth and omitted the bullion and added ham instead of sausage. This is a great recipe that you can leave cooking while you're at work or overnight.

Very good soup! I only added 9 cups of water instead of ten and used vegetable bouillon. I also added 2 cloves of fresh garlic instead of powder. I used turkey kilbasa instead of sausage. I took out the kilbasa before putting the soup in my blender to puree. Couldn't get enough of this soup.

I thought this was delicous and tasted just like the one purchased at a restaurant!  I skipped the sausage and cut one link of kielbasa in half and threw it in the pot with the rest of the ingredients.  (I threw the two large links of kielbasa in the trash afterwards).  That is the only change I made to the recipe-  that and I cooked it on high for six hours.  I let it cool for 45 minutes and then put it in a big container and kept it in the fridge overnight.  This morning I skimmed the layer of clear gel off of the top which I presume is fat and threw it out.  Even my 2 year old shared a bowl with me!  Definitely a keeper-  and such an EASY recipe!  It really only took 15 minutes to prepare everything and throw it in the slow cooker.  Thanks so much for a delicious, creamy, hearty winter soup!

This one passed the kid test. Even the picky youngest one loves it, although the word 'pea' is never used in conjunction with this meal. It's the "green soup" the kids request. I'll admit the look is never appetizing to any of us, but we've come to trust the taste. Very good!

Yummy!  All enjoyed this light-tasting (and, aside from the sausage, presumably quite healthy) soup.  Took about 3-4 hours simmering on the stove in a stockpot.  I followed the recipe exactly, but any vegetable that tastes nice when mushy would work (root vegetables, mostly).  Used dried green split peas.  The texture was a bit finer than the photo currently shown...almost like a cream soup, the peas broke up completely.  Be sure to stir regularly and THOROUGHLY if not using a slow cooker - I found the peas gunked up at the bottom of the pot.

This soup was sensational, I made it exactly as written. The smoked sausage gave it the right amount of smokey flavor, if you don't have a ham bone to make your soup with, this is a great alternative. I loved it and so did my friends and family. Thanks!!!

I love making soups in the crock pot and this is a keeper! I used frozen turkey broth that I had frozen over the holidays and that really made it good!I removed the lid for the last hour and that helped to thicken it up. The smoked sausage gave it great flavor. This was just great during our snow/ice storm!

This turned out very well for me. I followed the advice of other reviewers and used low fat, low sodium chicken broth - one of those big round cans. It was defiinitely done in the time specified and I ended up having to add more broth, at least 2 cups because it was too thick. Also, instead of the sausage I used a package of smoked turkey legs, probably about 2 lbs. Really good soup, I will definitely make it again.

Excellent! I used lite Polska Kielbasa sausage and used 1 1/2 packages of dried split peas, therefore, ended up using all 10 cups of liquid.  I used all chicken broth and it turned out the perfect consistency.  I sauteed the onions, celery, fresh garlic and sausage before adding the liquid.  We did add some additional salt and pepper to taste.  My kids loved this soup even more than their dad's! :) Thanks for the recipe!  It's a keeper!

This was so easy and delicious. The family raved. It was the only recipe I could find that didn't require some serious acrobatics to pull off, and yet it was superb.

This is an excellent, easy split pea.  I used two cans of chicken broth, a can of beef broth, two cups of water and a cube of beef boullion (it's what I had in the pantry).  I also used mild italian sausage, cut of the casings, and browned it before adding to the soup.  Very flavorful.

There isn't any reason to make changes to this recipe. It is really good just as it is. I will make this again and again. Perfect comfort food on a cold frosty day. Highly recomended. Do not cook for more than four hours.

I did exactly what the recipe said except I ommit the potatoes and ham. I ended up cooking it in the slow cooker for over 12 hours because I didn't realize how low, the low was!  Before I turned it up to high, I ended up using a handheld blender to break up the split peas since it was still hard.  I kept it on high for approx. 2 hours and I was finally able to smell the delicious aroma of the soup.  It made much more servings than I anticipated but it's a easy, and a tasty recipe.  My husband loved it!  Thanks for sharing.

Unlike others, I used all of the required liquid substituting about half a cup of water with milk.  The longer it cooked, the thicker it got.  My husband won't touch split pea soup, but he loved this with the cut up sausage.  I quartered the slices of sausage and only used about 2/3 of the package, as I don't really care for the sausage.  I will definitely make this again.

This worked out great! USed 6 cups of liquid (combo vegetable stock + water) and turkey kielbasa. Cooked about the same time and it was the perfect consistency.

I love split pea soup and this was great. I used about 4 c of water and 4 of some chicken broth left from cooking chix for salad. the bouillon is too  salty. Oh, and fresh garlic and no oregano. I cooked it about 10 hours on low.

Wonderful soup.  Day two is so much better - nice and thick - 5 stars! I added 2 TBS galic salt for more zip to the flavor. I recommend 3 hours on the stove top.

According to other reviews which claimed the soup was too watery and lacked favor, I only used 8 cups of water and added a tablespoon of tobasco.  I cooked it for 4 hours on high.  Also used 4 small red potatoes quartered, with skins on, instead of the 2 peeled potatoes suggested.  Very good.

Excellent recipe. I was a bit skeptical about using bouillon cubes and worried that the results would be too salty, but I was totally wrong. I did however let the soup cook a bit longer than the recipe called for in my slow cooker and it was well worth it. The green peas really softened and became nice and thick. I will definitely make this again!

This was great!  I cooked mine for 8 hours with ham hocks instead of sausage.  Then I took the ham off of the bone and removed the bay leaves and pureed the soup with a hand held mixer.  I used diced ham as a garnish.  It was fantastic.

This was the best pea soup I have EVER had....the only thing, it needed more like 10 hours in the crockpot....6 hours on low just didn't do it.  The longer you have the more I would let it cook

I didn't find a lot of flavor in this soup, other than the sausage, which gave kind of a greasy feel.  I followed the recipe as written, except I used 8 cups of water instead of 10.  I do think 10 would have been too thin.  I used Hillshire Farms smoked sausage.  The peas cooked to a good consistency at 5 hours on high, but I just wasn't a fan of the overall finished product.  To me, it was kind of bland.  Salt helped some, but not much.  My husband said it "wasn't bad", but not one of his favorites, either.  I don't think I will make it again.

This turned out much better than I expected. I used 8 cups of water rather than 10 as per another review & was glad I did.  Sicne reviews mentioned it being thin, I pureed 2 additional small potatoes at the end & mixed them into the soup.  It turned out great, nice & thick & creamy.  Thanks for a super-easy split-pea soup.

I and my 30 dinner guests really enjoyed this soup.  I left out the sausage and it was still very flavorful.  I had to make a lot, so I cooked it over the stove in a very large pot for 2.5 hours and it turned out wonderfully!

Absolutely the best I've had.  So flavorful, but my crockpot wasn't large enough so used my Dutch Oven. I put this recipe on Crockpot Board, but a user thought it was too thin.  Mine was not.

Split pea is one of my favorite soups, so I have tried quite a few different recipes. This one is delicious and will probably be the one I use most often. I did not have sausage on hand, so I used turkey bacon.

This is a great recipe although it does take longer than 5hrs to cook I would say 7minimum if you want a nick thick soup I did use ham instead of sausage because that is what I had and did only use 8cups of water instead of 10 because I have a smaller crockpot but over all a great recipe

I stopped using my slow cooker some time ago, as I feel there is less control over recipes like this.  I like to be able to take off the cover and check seasoning and perhaps add an ingredient that might be missing and quickly return it to cooking temperature.  Instead I made it in a favorite stock pot and poked and prodded and tasted till it was perfect.  And it is a wonderful soup.  Jim

I modified the recipe by substituting diced smoked ham instead of sausage and cut the water down to 6 cups it was perfectly thick. Very tasty but Does make quite a bit of soup, great for a group !

As written, the recipe comes out a little thin. I prefer to reduce the water to 8 cups. This does make a lot of soup, but it freezes well for leftovers at a later date.

My family and friends all love this recipe.  I used 1/2 water and 1/2 chicken broth.  I added fresh garlic in place of the powdered and added smoked ham and smoked sausage as well as a ham bone.  Cooked on the stove for 3 hours and then transfered to a crock pot to keep warm

Very tasty, light, and flavorful!! After reading other suggestions I use 7 cups water and 1cup of chicken stock (since I had some leftover). I agree with others that 10 cups total as the original recipe calls for would make the soup very watery. Also, I used 93% fat free turkey bacon 12oz instead of sausage. And the smokey bacon flavor was great with hardly any fatty/heavy taste. One more thing I would recommend to others: use 2 “large” potatoes, which will help to make the soup thicker. I used 1 small and 1 medium red potatoes (available in fridge today), and the soup was a little runny and I would’ve liked it a little thicker.

As is, the recipe seems to have too much liquid, but by tomorrow, you may need to add the extra because it gets SO THICK! So if you’re making it for tomorrow, I’d use the called for amount of liquid. We’ll be making this again, served up with some homemade crusty sourdough. :-)

My only changes: I sautéed the onions, celery and minced garlic along with three pieces of diced bacon before adding them to the cooker and used diced ham instead of sausage. It was absolutely delicious after five hours. Yum.

I have made this recipe for years. I make it exactly as written except I use ham instead of sausage. It is very watery the first day but thickens very nicely the 2nd day and has even more flavor too. also  freezes very well for several months. always a hit for the family and great for potlucks and gatherings. thanks!

This is a great soup however I made mine on stove top and then put in crock pot... I  cooked peas first in half broth half water until tender then put in blender or food processor and blend till smooth. Sautéed the rest in same pot and made sure to cut carrots thin..add the blended peas and more broth as needed..put in crock pot to meld together.  (I tried it just in crock pot and was just too watery for my taste) over all this is a good recipe

DELICIOUS! But I made a few small changes... I increased chicken boullion to 3T, added 1t cumin and 1t salt. Cooked on low for 10 hrs and added 1.5c instant mashed potato flakes at the end to thicken it up a bit. Everyone LOVED it!

I read the reviews before making this so I only added 8 cups of water. I substituted bacon for sausage. The soup was a bit watery at the end of the cooking time but it thickened up as it cooled. Thanks for the recipe :)

I used smoked turkey sausage and it came out perfectly! I did use an immersion blender at the end to liquify everything a bit and thicken it up and it was delicious. The best split pea I’ve made yet, and I have tried a few different recipes over the years.

I made this per the recipe, and found it too thin, and too bland. Also thought everything was a little mushy. It's a good start, but for next time I will make some changes:

* Less water
* Add more spices, maybe some jalapeno and more
* Use a much spicier sausage, and more of it, maybe 1.5 lbs.
* Don't add the veggies until hour three. They got too soft.
* Too much potato, not enough carrot, so adjust ratios.

I tweaked a few things here and there-  I used HAM not sausage. First I added onion, a large jalapeño and diced ham in a skillet caramelize. Once caramelized I transferred to crockpot and Added leftover bacon, 8 cups of  chicken broth (no bouillon), whole bag of julienned carrots, omit bay leaves, potatoes and oregano. It will be plenty thick after the electric hand mixer gets a hold of it. Oh and can’t forget a 1/4 - 1/2 cup (yes I mean cup) of Sriracha. Let it cook minimum of 5 hours on high. NOTE: do the same but for only 90 minutes in an electric pressure cooker.

This split pea soup is easy and delicious! I made two crockpots for church, one 5-quart, one 7-quart. This recipe makes a LOT of soup and there wasn't a drop left! I made three small changes. One, I used 8 cups of chicken broth, rather than the 10 cups of water and the boullion. Two, I used fresh minced garlic, rather than the powder. Three, I used a fully cooked smoked ham that I cubed, rather than the sausage. Other than these small changes I followed the recipe precisely. As another reviewer suggested, I "trusted the recipe" in regards to the herbs and spices and didn't add anything extra. Even using low sodium chicken broth it was plenty salty and the few simple herbs really allowed the flavors to blend well. Because I have a disability that leaves me with little energy, I used canned sliced carrots, canned small peeled whole potatoes and bought the celery and onion already chopped from the produce department. The only thing I had to chop was the ham, making this a soup that literally went together in minutes. This is seriously the best split pea soup I've ever made or eaten! Thank you Dorothy!

My favorite soup thus far.  Changes i made:  8 cups of water (i prefer a thicker soup) & i used chicken sausage.  After 5 hours on high, i removed the sausage & bay leaf & pureed it with my hand blender.  Added the sausage back in & it was perfect!

Delicious as written. I did use a ham bone and diced ham instead of sausage. I only used 6 cups of water as there was no room for more with the large ham bone. I used 2 Tbsp low sodium chicken base and instead of oregano, try 1 tsp dried rosemary.

Made this as directed except I replaced the sausage with a big meaty ham hock. It was wonderful. Next time I'll try the smoked sausage for variety. Would recommend it.

If my peas hadn't been old and had softened up instead of remaining hard, this would have been excellent! But that's not the fault of the recipe. I followed the recipe aside from using 6c broth & 4c water rather than all water. I slow-cooked it for about 15 hours, and the peas still weren't soft. :( But the flavor was great, and I liked the consistency: more watery, like a broth based soup rather than a thick chowder. I'll try this again with fresher peas. Thanks!

This was so simple and delicious! I tripled the amount of carrots and celery, I also added about half of a large white onion.  The tomatoes I used had chilies in them. I took one persons advice and didn't add the tomatoes until the the last hour and the lentils cooked just fine. Had this on low in the crockpot for about 10 hours! I will definitely be making this again! Also I pre cut the carrots, celery, onion , and kielbasa put in a large bowl with salt and pepper, sealed and put in the fridge the night before so all my wife had to do in the morning was put everything in and go!! Not sure if this helped with the blandness that so people where complaining about.

One of the best slow cooker soup recipes ever. Did not deviate from the recipe and turned out GREAT. Will make again soon.

5 star. I followed the recipe exactly. It was so tasty, not as salty as I thought it would be. I also made it this weekend, but my slow-cooker was out on loan, so I just used a Creuset pot on the stove top. Just as good. I haven't tried to freeze it, but it doesn't last that long in this house on a winter's weekend.

I made this and left out the potatoes and carrots because they soaked up too much flavor of the sausage.  I used polksa kielbasa. I wanted the sausage flavor in the peas. I also changed oregano to 1/4 tspn and bay leaf to half a leaf.  It came out the way I like it with lots of sausage flavor in the peas.  I'll make this once a month during the winter.

This is absolutely  the best  Pea soup!  I sautéed the vegetables  and sausage  in 2T butter before adding all ingredients in crockpot .  I cooked on low  for 6-7 hours and added up to  1/2 C instant potatoes  to thicken just before serving. Yum!

It was a hit. I made it with chicken broth and smoked turkey sausage and instead of chicken bullion I used beef just because that's what I had at home but it turned out great. It was even better the second day.

Very good recipe. I had leftover smoked ham so I used that instead of the sausage. Also left out the carrots since my son will not go near them. Turned out great anyway.

This turned out really good.  I did use diced Ham in place of the sausage due to preference.  I cooked the peas in the slow cooker for about 2 hours before adding the veggies b/c I didn't want them to be mush.  This worked out perfect.  The soup was very runny and thin the day I made it but I made it ahead for the next day and the fridge did the trick in making it a thicker consistency with chunks of veggies. Oh, I also used chicken broth in place of the water/bouillon and fresh garlic sauteed with the onion instead of powder.

KEEPER!!! Absolutely  delicious!  A friend of mine insisted they did not like split pea tried it and was blown away! This is not the ultra thick split pea my grandma made and it was a nice change to have something more liquid. 8 cups was perfect, 10 would have been WAY to much. Used chicken broth instead of bullion, no water.

Didn't have any of the sausage on hand.  Next time I'll try it with, perhaps it'll elevate the flavors.

Absolutely delicious.  I used a left over ham bone and reduced water to 8 cups as suggested.  Glad I did.  After cooking for 5 hours on high the soup looked very thin and watery but flavor was great.  I was making it for the next day so put the soup in a container and stirred it up when ready to reheat and it thickened right up to be smooth & creamy.  First taste was a bit salty, the following day the flavors melded together even better and doesn't seem salty at all now, just right.  I love that the soup is tasting better and better each day.  Will definitely keep this recipe.

Had to give 4 not 5 stars because of alterations, BUT...Great soup, easy directions, and easy to improvise on!  I did follow liquid amounts listed on bag of beans, prefer thick pea soup.  Thanks for the inspiration!

My family loved this recipe so much I am trading my Mom's Split Pea Soup recipe for this one (sorry Mom)!  It was easy, the ingredients were on hand and it was easy to tweak to fit my husband's taste; his only suggestion was to give the smoked sausage a little fry action before adding it to the crock pot.

great recipe for the crockpot!  Other than using the sausage I didn't change a thing. Rather than the sausage I threw in two ham hocks.  I let them cook in the soup all day then removed them, shredded the meat and added it back to the soup.  The soup was a little thick at the end so I just added some additional stock to thin it to the consistency that I wanted. Very good... thank you for this recipe!

Best Split Pea Soup I have ever made.  I did every thing recipe said to do.  Except I used chicken sausage instead and I put 1 1/2 pounds in instead of 1 pound.  My husband like lots meat.  He said it was best Split Pea Soup he has ever had.

Very good crock pot split pea soup! Changes I made were using 8C. chicken broth instead of 10C. water & bouillon cubes. I used turkey kiebasa & did add more spices! Fresh pressed garlic, savory, parsley, pepper, & a touch of cayenne were a few additions I made.

This soup was disappointingly bland.  I had made 2 changes - 8 cups of chicken broth an used smoked ham instead. I doubt if I haven't made changes the result would have been any better. I had to add a lot of spice after to make it even worth eating... I love split pea soup but just not this one.

Very yummy though I did make a few tweaks....I used a leftover ham shoulder bone in place of the sausage, omitted the bouillon and potatoes since I didn't have them on hand and used a full teaspoon of oregano.  Also reduced the water to 6 cups for a heartier soup.  Fantastic and simple!

Cut the broth back to 8 cups and STILL too watery. I didn't expect super thick but this was very thin. Not the split pea soup I was expecting. That said, the taste was very good. I'll probably try it again with 4 cups of broth.

I used the leftover hambone from thanksgiving & added a hamhock for smokey flavor. I also did 4 cups chicken stock & 4 cups water.  In the last hour, I added a pound of cubed ham. If you add it in the beginning, it will be the size of a pea .

Best and easiest split pea soup.  I grate all the veggies using my cuisinart and use 8 cups broth instead of 10 cups water.  Excellent.  I have made this countless times and have all my friends making it as well!

I always choose to use ham over sausage since I buy a whole half hog and have plenty of ham. I just take a ham slice and chop it into pieces and put it in. 

I also choose to, rather than use bouillon, to use broth instead. 

This time instead of chopping the carrots and celery I just used the food processor and grated them. Husband doesn't like big chunks of veggies so I figure shredded/chopped - doesn't really matter. 

I never add potatoes to mine but this time I did add half a medium size zucchini so I hope that turns out. I can't see why it won't. If anything it might make it thicker. 

I always start with adding 7 cups of water and then add more as needed (my broth is concentrated so I use water to dilute). 

I know I make quite a few changes but, overall, this recipe is great and you can tweak it however you like for your tastes. You even could easily make it vegan or vegetarian by using vegetable broth instead of chicken. 

I like serving mine with cornbread or garlic toast. It is a wonderful dinner and leftovers on a chilly fall or winter day!

Amazing!!!!!  I only used 6 cups of chicken broth per other reviews and that was the perfect amount!  I also did not add potatoes.  Followed everything else to a tee. It was ready on low in 5 hours.  Love the simplicity of throwing this recipe together.  And yes, it is mushy but that is how I know all of my split pea soups to be.  Will make again!

delicious! I put the sausage in just long enough to heat it up, or else it loses its flavor.

I don't know about anyone else;  I didn't care for pea soup when I was a kid,  but not anymore.  What a super idea with the slow cooker.  I'm very traditional when it come to the meat in the soup;  ham all the way

tastes great.  i didn't have potatoes so i added 1 tbs of corn starch and 1 cup of milk to give it some creaminess.  Also, I followed the suggestion of another review who stated 10 cups of water made it too watery.  I only used 8 cups and with the corn starch and milk it thickened up a bit.  I'll make again and try the potatoes to see how it turns out.

I didn't care for this at all. It turned out like a big thick flavorless glob of smooshed peas and potatoes. I probably cooked it too long, but I cooked it for less time than what was recommended. I'm not sure I would try this again without some adjustments. Sorry.

Just made this soup and it is delicious! My crock pot is a little smaller so I only used 6 cups of water, 3 veggie bouillon cubes, and turkey kilbasa but kept the other proportions (so it would be a little more thicker) and it turned out great. Would definitely make it again

This is the best soup I have had in a very long time! I did use 8 cups of water instead of 10 and it took a lot longer to cook in my slow cooker than directions stated, but oh so delicious!

Really great recipe. I gave it 4 stars because I used 8 cups of broth rather than 10 (we like a thicker soup) and I used diced ham instead of the kielbasa since that's all I had. Next time I'm going to sweat the onion and garlic a bit and use kielbasa.

Really easy, really good. I think next time I'll use ham instead though. I think that will give it the edge to 5 stars.

As a busy mom, I'm always looking for good crock pot recipes and this one will be a keeper for me.  Since I had a ham bone from Easter, I used it instead of the sausage - I boiled it with the peas and water, added some broth too and put it on high for 3 hours.  Then I took out the bone and scraped off the ham, added it back in with the rest of the ingredients.  Cut the bullion cubes down to one and left it on low for another 2 hours.  It came out so delicious even my 7 year old asked for seconds.  I will make this again and am looking forward to trying it with the sausage.

5 stars. Made exactly as recipe calls for except for the addition of an extra packet of chicken bullion. next time I will cut out 2 cups of water to make it thicker. Even the little kids ate it.

I'm no cook, and everyone who tried this raved about it! I was so worried because it didn't start to look like it should up until the very last hour. It did take about an hour longer than this said.

Wonderful! Ive always had my own recipe for split pea soup and I've always loved it.  It just never occurred to me that would be a quicker way to make it and this is just the bomb!  just marvelous. I admit i made a couple of changes, but purely because of our tastes - I absolutely HATE bay leaves and I used jarred crushed garlic.  Next time I'm using pork ribs in stead of the sausage. and with that - I'll have 3 versions of the best pea soup ever :) thanks so much

I thought the 5 hours was too long to cook it.  By that time the peas had practically disappeared and the vegetables were very soft.  Won't try this one again.

This is a wonderful rainy night soup with a wonderful flavor.  I couldn't give it a 5 only because my daughter doesn't like sausage but we all loved this one other than that.  Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious! I threw 3 ham hocks in and pullled the little bit of meat off at the end along with the sausage. Next time, I may just use chopped ham and sausage. Very delicious and very flavorful (not to mention EASY!!)

I used 8 cups of water and that worked really well. I think 10 cups would have been too much.  This recipe makes a decent pot of soup.

I made this recently and it was very tasty. I followed the recipe exactly and panicked when I took the lid off the slow cooker.  It was green water until I stirred.  The peas definitely settle on the bottom. My kids even liked it. Will definitely make again.

Quick and easy to make.  I used smoked turkey sausage for lower fat.  I assembled all the ingredients in my slow cooker the night before and refrigerated overnight.  In the morning I just added 4 cups of chicken broth and 2 cups of water, set it for 4.5 hrs, and went to work.  Came home to a perfect, delicious, and hearty meal!  Thanks for a great recipe!

OK. it's New Years Day and with all the festivities I hadn't planned for todays tradition of beans...so I modified this to what I had on hand.  I used Great Northern Beans and 1 lb of Sweet Italian Sausage.  Added Italian Seasoning and used 6 c. chicken broth, 4 c. water and 4 tsp. boullion and an extra potato.  It was great!!

I made this and the only deviation is I added 2 smoked ham hocks from my local butcher and used chicken broth instead of boulion and NO water Just get broth. My Dad now says, So when you gonna make that pea soup again? The ham hocks add a really awesome smokey flavor!

This was a perfect meal for the first cold day of fall. Split pea is my DH's favorite soup and he said this was the best he had ever had. I only used 8 cups of water and used ham instead of sausage. I cooked it on low for 10 hours, the peas completely disenegrated, but it was the perfect texture. I used fresh garlic and chicken base instead of the cubes. Can't wait for leftovers at lunch tomorrow. I will be making this again and again.

Delicious!!!  My husband and I both agreed, this is our new favorite Split Pea Soup.  I'm used to making soup with a ham bone and all- but never again!  Super easy and even better the next day.  Added more carrots and a little less potatoes as they don't freeze in soup well.

what am I doing wrong???  This is the 2nd slow cooker recipe I have botched in a week (the first being "Chicken stuffing" - what a gross mess that turned out to be).  It is on high (6 1/2 hours now); and is a clear broth with crunchy peas in it. THE PEAS INSTRUCTED , "NOT TO SOAK FIRST! Why can't I ever do a slow cooker recipe?  I get so VERY dissuaded when this happens; and just go back to stopping at THE FISH HOUSE for an overpriced meal.  It may be cheap doing it this way . . .  but only if you can eat it :)

My husband and I both loved this.  I was surprised at how tasty it was considering there were not a lot of ingredients.  The consistency was great - not overly thick like some split pea soups I've had.

Very Good!  I used Itailan sauage and I happened to have some chopped up ham and threw in it.  I also added a 1/2 teaspoon of marjoram and a 1/2 teaspoon thyme.  I will make this soup again.

I loved this recipe!!!  I followed other's advice and used 6 cups of chicken broth instead of the boullion and the remainder was water.  I used Hillshire Farms spicy sausage and cut it into to pieces, probably only ended up using about 3/4 lb.  I cooked on high for about 5 hours and low for one more hour.  As others stated, about four hours in, it did seem like it wouldn't thicken but it did.  I added marjoram, salt and garlic powder with about one hour left, which is what I always do with slow cookers.  I think next time I will add about 1/4 of the bag maybe half way through to see if that has bigger pieces left.  I will definitely be making this again!

Slight changes: in a large pot, sauteed sausage and veggies in olive oil, then added rest of ingredients (using 8 cups of water). Simmered for 2.5 hrs, soup was thick and hearty. Perfect for a cold day!

I only used 8 cups of water, added black pepper and some curry powder, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It was great! I used smoked Polish sausage. It was nice and spicy and added much flavor to the soup. Boyfriend loved it!

This definitely won't last long since it was so delicious.  I didn't use celery because I don't like it.  As other reviewers did, I cooked the sausage in the pan before adding them.  I also used 8 cups of chicken broth instead of the buillon cubes and added some marjoram.  Great recipe. Thank you!

This was just ok.  It didn't taste bad, but it was very bland.  If you like food with lots of flavor, this is not your recipe.  Adding some salt, more garlic powder, and some cayenne pepper helped a little.  

Decreasing the water to 8 cups still made for a fairly runny soup.  If I try this again, I will be using 6-7 cups.

Also, I think slightly fying up the sausage before adding to the soup would help.  The sausage was almost like a soggy hot dog.  Not bad, just not the best.

Delicious!! I made a few changes, I didn't have any sausage so I used a 12 oz chunk of salt pork instead, cut into small pieces. I used a quart of chicken stock, and about 5 cups of water for the liquids.  Everything else I did the same. My hubby and I ate the leftovers the next couple days for lunch, this makes a big pot of soup. I served it with some cornbread muffins, which were the perfect touch.

EXACTLY what I was looking for. Put everything into the slow cooker for 4 hours (9 cups of water) and used 2 smoked pork chops instead of sausage (cubed the meat and put the bones in for flavor). After 4 hours on high I took the bones out and it was still too thin, so I added another 1/2 lbs. of peas and let sit for 2 more hours. Turned out PERFECT.  Will be enjoying for days! Thanks so much!!

Made this once and it was OK, but easy.
The second time I made it, I realized about 5 minutes before I left for work that I had no slit peas.  Everything else was in the crockpot and ready to go.  I brought a 1# bag of black-eyed peas to a boil, drained them, and threw them in there.  Cooked on low x 8hrs.  Used regular sausage, not smoked.  I'm not a fan of black-eyed peas, but this was fine to me and my husband loved it--he's a tough critic.

husband approved!  only used 8 cups of water & 4 boullion cubes -- could've lost 1 more cube.  also fried up some bacon, crumbled and added to pot, then sauteed onions, celery and garlic in the grease before adding to pot.  threw in the 1/2 head of cabbage (finely shredded) sitting in the fridge too.  great recipe to use up things in the fridge and for cold days!  sausage added a LOT of flavor, so choose wisely.  will definitely make this again this winter.

Great recipe and easy to play with! I used small lima beans because that's what I had, picked low-fat kielbasa as the sausage and used some adobo instead of garlic powder and forgot the oregano! Since I was using the larger beans, I cooked just the beans & broth for a couple hours then added the veggies & meat. Super delish!

I love the extra vegies in this soup, however traditional ham is better. Cut down the water to 8 and cook an extra hour with no lid on and it will thicken nicely.

I've made this a couple of times now.  I like to use spicy sausage.  I also nearly double the veggies, and haven't used celery.  We like it best when I blend 1/2 to 1/3 of the soup in the blender to make it a little creamier.  I also cut back the water by a couple of cups.  Very yummy!

This one is a keeper!  After cooking it in the crock pot, I skimmed out the sausage and blended the soup so it was creamy.  I added the sausage back in and stuck it in the fridge.  We had it for lunch over the next few days and it was great.  Thanks for the posting.

It was okay which is why I gave it 3 stars.  I noted a couple of the complaints here about the soup being a bit too watery, so I ended up using 8 cups of chicken broth instead of 10 cups of water.  I used a smokey sausage as well.  It made for a different taste but I much prefer my pea soup to be VERY thick and to have ham in it. (or a ham bone which is better) With that said, I won't be making it again.  I'll stick to my more traditional way of making pea soup.

Very simple to make.  You end up with a tasty and hearty soup.  It definitely does not take much of this stuff to fill you up.  We also made bread bowls and ate it with them.

My husband ate this and thought it was pretty good.  My children and I did not really care for it.  Perhaps if I make this again I will use a different sausage, this time we used smoked turkey sausage and after cooking so long in the soup it had no flavor left.

This was excellent. I did make some changs just based on what I had on hand.  The adjustments worked, it was so good!  Instead of carrots, I added one leek green and white parts chopped, green and white onion chopped, 2 cups of chopped celery, no garlic powder, 1 tbls curry powder, salt pepper, 2 bouillon cubes instead of 4, and 1 cup chopped leftover ham instead of sausage.  After slow cooking I put into blender to puree until creamy.  Really delicious.

Excellent soup, a little too "soupy" for me.  Next time I make it, I won't put so much water in it.  Great leftovers even!

Pretty good stuff!  I liked how this turned out with the potatoes and the sausage (kind of hesitant on the whole sausage thing at the beginning).  I did make a few alterations: 1) I used only 8c of broth/water 2) 4 of the 8 cups were chicken broth 3) I used fresh garlic paste instead of powder 4) I left half of the peas out until a few hours into the cooking.  Overall this was a pretty darn good recipe.  It took a hour or so longer to cook than everyone was saying, but that might have been my slow cooker's fault.  Who knows.  Only think I would do different next time is actually to add all of the peas at the beginning.  I don't think that I like that much substance to them there at the end.

To make this more festive, I used 2 lb. of chuck roast instead of the sausage. I cooked it on low for about eight hours because I was out of the house. The smell was amazing, but I wasn't so excited about the flavor. I also missed the barley that most split pea soups have.

This recipe is awesome!  Tastes just like a good Diner split pea!  I changed a few things.. I used chicken stock instead of boullion and I used about a 1/2 pound of kielbaba, but left it whole and used it just for flavoring (I threw it out once the soup was finished)  I just put everything in the crock pot on high for 8 hours and it turned out great!  I will make this again!

This recipe was fantastic! I did cook in a stockpot on the stove, but that just hurried the process along. Also, in addition to smoked sausage I added a good 1/2 lb. of andouille to add something extra. Anyway, a great recipe that everybody enjoyed!

Made this recipe without the sausage, put leftover honey baked ham from Easter instead.  Substituted the boullion cubes for straight chicken stock.  Ended up blending the end result as my boyfriend said it usually is pureed after it's made.  The taste was good.  I never had split pea before so I don't have anything to compare it to.  Nice to just throw it in the crock pot and not have to worry about it.

I really enjoyed this soup.  I carmelized the onions before tossing them in the slow cooker, and used turkey kilbasa (about 1.5 lbs).  Otherwise I pretty much followed the recipe.  Although my boyfriend prefers the stove top soup I make with ham and bacon, this is an easier and healthier option, and I liked it a lot.

Great idea to use sausage for a new tasting pea soup! I scaled this recipe down to half as there are only 2 of us in the house. I used 5 cups of chicken stock, approx. 1 cup/8 oz. mixed split yellow & green peas, and had no celery or potatoes on hand, so made do without them. I sauteed some diced pork along with 2 bratwurst (sliced) with approx. 1 cup sliced carrots in olive oil, then added rest of ingredients (plus misc. spices) to the pot and cooked on stovetop approx 2 hours to leave it hearty. The addition of the sausage makes it a full meal, add some shredded cheese to the top and a slice of toast and it's perfect! PS-- This made a TON of soup; more like double the serving yield stated (at least for our family), so I hope it freezes well!

The Best! I followed the recipe exact except for one change - I added about 1/2 cup canned corn that I had leftover from another recipe. My husband especially loves it and says it's the best split pea soup I've made :-) ahhh - music to my ears. Unlike some other reviewers I did not find this soup to be thin - I found it to be just the right consistency. I made it on the stove top - like it says in the Notes section at the bottom of the recipe and it only took 2 hours to prepare :-)

I really like this soup.  I recommend using regular smoked sausage (instead of a reduced-fat kind) for the best flavor.  This soup can take longer than the recipe says, though.  I use the slow cooker on high for anywhere between 5 and 8 hours - then I finish it on the stovetop.  For some reason, I cannot get the right consistency in the slow cooker alone.  Definitely a soup worth trying.

This recipe was very easy and very yummy! It is amazing how you can put everything in the crockpot and it comes out perfect. I used leftover cooked ham that I had. I followed the recipe exactly as stated. The only addition was some salt and pepper to taste at the end. Very good! Thank you for such a great recipe.

Sooo good! My husband loves it. It takes a little time to dice everything up, but it's worth it. It has a wonderful flavor. I add a little more salt to satisfy our tastes. I have passed this recipe on to all of my family. They love it as well.

Being traditional and afraid of change, I used ham instead of the sausage.  And then after I already started cooking it, I was browsing through the reviews and noticed all of the comments about it being too thin, which was quite worrisome because i added an extra 2 cups of water since I find my soup always comes out too thick to begin with.  I decided to ad an extra bag of peas and ended up with the same old soup...the condensed version that had to be thinnned.  Even so, pea soup is pea soup and I enjoyed it all the same.

My crockpot couldn't hold the 10 cups of liquid and I thought just as well, because we like our soup thick.  However, even with approximately 8 cups of water this soup was super-thin.  I have a few other recipes for split pea and they are all superior to this one, so I won't be using this recipe again.

Too watery for us. I decreased the water to 8 cups and even tried blending in some of the mixture, but it did not thick enough. If I made it again I might try 5-6  cups of water.

Very good.  I made it with chopped ham steak.  Only suggestion was it needed salt and pepper because it tasted too sweet from the carrots.  It also seemed a little watery even though I also reduced water to 8 cups.

It was alright kind of plain though, nobody was too big of a fan of it. Most of it is still in my fridge.

I thought the taste was great, but I had a bit of a challenge with this soup.  My slow cooker only held about 8 cups of water plus the other ingredients, but given other reviews I thought it would be okay.  I put it on low as I left for work, and when I returned 10 hours later it was not done--and a lot of it had bubbled out onto the counter.  So I cleaned that up, took out a little more liquid, and turned the cooker to high.  I had something else for dinner and went out to a meeting.  On my return three hours later, more of the soup was on the counter, but it was finished.  I only took a small taste since it was bedtime, and I didn't really eat it until the following night.  When I finally did get to eat it I thought it was very good, it was plenty thick, and it was worth making again--being careful not to fill the slow cooker too full.

As written, I can only give this recipe two stars.  I did follow the advice of reducing the water amount to 8 cups, but I still felt the end product was a big disappointment.  I salvaged this soup by blending most of the mixture with a hand blender to thicken it up, and then I added about two tablespoons of potato starch dissolved in cold water.  The soap was edible, but I felt it could have used quite a bit more vegetables because the 8 cups of water still yielded a lot of soup.  Sorry!

The house smelled great, but the soup was awful!!!!  We live in a part of the country that makes a lot of soup in the cold weather & I wouldn't call this soup.  There was NO flavor & it was very runny & I had to brush my teeth & use mouthwash to get a good taste in my mouth after eating this.  When making my split pea soup I may try doing it in a crockpot though because it was easy.

This is the best split pea soup I've come across yet. And, it doesn't get much easier than throwing everything into the crock pot! The split peas pretty much disintigrated by the end of the cooking time, but that didn't bother me at all. I'd prefer that to them not being cooked through. I also didn't use the bay leaves. I don't think the soup needed them.  Overall, I loved the flavor and texture. Thanks Dorothy!

The best pea soup ever!  Even my picky 4 year old will eat this soup.  I use fat free smoked turkey sausage and it worked great.  Perfect for cold days.  I doubled the recipe and have frozen, when defrosted it was excellent.

bleck - we didnt like this. Sausage was soggy and we didnt like how it turned out. We are inexperienced with the split pea soup deal so that might be it. Thanks anyway

Excellent recipe.  Took the advice of the other reviewers and put in 8 cups of water.  However, my husband and I like soup you can stand a spoon up in so I also put in another pound of split peas and left out the potatoes.  We LOVE it.  Thanks.

Very Good.  I did take the suggestion of other reviewers and only used 8 cups of liquid.  4 cups were chicken broth 4 were water and I only used 3 bouillons.  I used Ham instead of sausage becuase I had it left over.  One last recommendation is to use more seasoning.

This was good, but I had the opposite problem with mine...it was really thick!  My leftovers were so think I had to add extra water!  I made it exactly as the recipe said.  If I make this again, I would probably cut the sausage up a little smaller, and maybe even add another cup or two of water.

Had a good flavor, but the peas turned out REALLY mushy.  I probably  won't make this again.

Pea and bean soups in the slow cooker is the ONLY way to go, in my opinion!  So easy and fuss-free.  I've made this one twice, once with sausage as suggested and yesterday I made it with turkey ham.  Both were equally delicious.  This is a simple recipe that tastes better the second day and also reheats well.  I like that it doesn't get as mushy as some pea soups, especially if you use whole dried peas like I did.  (Thinking back on this, I think I might have made it once without meat entirely, too.)

I just threw this in the crockpot this morning, and my husband loves it.  It took a lot longer to cook than the recipe called for (the peas didn't seem to want to soften).  But with patience (and lots of garlic added, this is a new favorite after "tweaking".

This was great! Just be aware that not all slow cookers are the same, mine took longer - but was worth the wait!
