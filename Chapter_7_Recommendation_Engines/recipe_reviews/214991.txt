Quick, easy, but as is a bit bland. Next time, I'll add some crushed red pepper and a bit more salt.

this was really good and very quick and easy, great for a busy weeknight supper. I followed the recipe exactly using fresh tomato, garlic and basil.  Even my picky 10 year old liked it.

I added zucchini but otherwise followed the recipe.  My ingredients were very fresh, tomatoes and basil right out of the garden.  I found this dish lacking in taste and will not make again.

we eat this in our house about once a week.  i use the colored pasta and sometimes add a can of olives to it.  but it's light, quick, and a hit even with the kids.  i do use olive oil to mix everything together, it blends the flavors more (my own opinion) i also put in a pinch or two of crushed red peppers - just to give it a bit more kick...  serve it with a green salad and maybe some sourdough bread and you are set!!!

Still cannot believe there is no oil or sauce in this which is a good thing for the calorie conscious.  One can taste the "fresh" and maybe some sliced mushrooms and onions would only add to it.

Husband loved this, and it was so easy. A hearty pasta dish, without a lot of heavy sauce. I added yellow onion to mine and instead of fresh leaf basil, I used fresh squeeze basil you find in the produce area. I added the basil right at the end of cooking. I can see adding more veggies to to this as well.

For a basic recipe, I was surprised at how delicious this was.  It seemed to be much lighter than the typical pasta dish since there is no heavy sauce, only the moisture from the tomatoes.  I can see making this many times in the future.

I added a little olive oil to make the beef a bit tastier and stick to the pasta better.

Didn't have fresh tomatoes so I used 1- 28oz can of diced tomatoes drained and 1- 14oz can of stewed tomatoes with the juice and that added a lot of flavor. Also I had no fresh basil so I used a table spoon of dried and I added red pepper flakes and we couldn't stop eating it.   2 cups instead of the 1 1/2 cups of bowtie pasta and still barely enough. Thank you for the recipe it was a great starter.

I tried this recipe with Johnsonville Mild Italian Sausage, and it was delicious!  I subbed the sausage for the ground beef, and there are only 6 ingredients, if you don't count salt and pepper, which I did not find necessary to use.  The sausage has plenty of flavor, and the use of fresh ingredients gave this dish a lively, interesting taste.  If you do make this, try to use fresh basil, because it complements the sausage.  Every bite made me want more, so I was glad DH and DS beat me to the skillet for seconds!

I do something similar..however, no garlic, no basil, no parm cheese. Instead,  to the ground beef and tomato mixture, I add 6-7 cooked bacon slices, crumbled ,as well as one stick of butter,, about 1/4 tsp of salt. I also let simmer for more than 5 minutes....more like 30....to really let the flavors blend, (this is key) stirring occasionally. Then just add the skillet mixture to the bow ties. SO flavorful.  (I wish I had a photo but I just recently finished off the leftovers lol)

This is a hit in my house as a base recipe. I added more garlic red onion and fresh spinach to it. I also add 1/3 cup of olive oil and extra basil and parmesan cheese. Mix it all and then top with more cheese served with garlic bread..

I added Italian Seasoning after browning the meat. This really made the dish like the description "Ground beef and bow tie pasta cooked in garlic, Italian seasoning and tomatoes."

Made this as directed, but it needed some help.  The base ingredients are all really good & work together well.  However, when done, sauce was absolutely necessary.  As others have noted, dryness was an issue, but it was more than that.  The meal components needed to be tied together in a cohesive way.  I added about a cup & a half of garlic tomato sauce to do that.  After adding that in, the meal easily became a 4, my rating is given as recipe is written on the site.  I served this with homemade garlic bread, & it made a simple, satisfying meal.

This recipe is perfect for my kids to make.   We added mushrooms and more garlic, didn't have the cheese or the basil ... but eh, I didn't hear anyone complaining.   Kids are fed and happy, mom is happy because the clean up was minimal,  and so was the cost of the ingredients.   Lucky if I spent ten dollars on the entire meal.   Now that's what I'm talking bout!!!

Hubby wasn't a fan of this but, I liked it.
Substituted garlic powder for garlic cloves, 1 Tablespoon of dried basil leaves and 1-14.5 oz can petite diced tomatoes + 2 Tablespoons water.  Don't let liquid evaporate, this will be dry and bland.

I was looking for something different to make with ground beef and stumbled across this recipe.  Thought it looked good and easy so I decided to give it a try.  I was not disappointed!  It was delicious!  I did have to make a couple of substitutions for ingredients I didn't have on hand and made a couple of additions.  I didn't have any parmesan cheese or fresh basil so I used fresh grated mozarella and dried italian seasoning.  I also used mini farfalle since I'm a huge fan of mini pasta.  My husband and I like a bit of heat so I also added some red pepper flakes.  I will definitely be making this over and over as it is so easy and fast to put together.  I will use fresh grated parmesan the next time and decide which cheese I prefer.
