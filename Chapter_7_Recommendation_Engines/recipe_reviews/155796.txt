This recipe is a great idea for the health conscience (like myself). I would make one minor suggestion though (for those who like cinnamon), I would add a full teaspoon of cinnamon, rather than the 1/8th. The extra cinnamon gives the muffins a nice sweetness. Personally, the original recipe isn't sweet enough for me, but the full teaspoon of cinnamon makes it perfect.   Lastly, I know cooking times do vary based upon location and glassware/cookware, but it took a full 30 mins for the centers of the muffins to be cooked fully (rather than the 20 mins suggested).   P.S. The topping is soo yummy and sweet (must be the full tablespoon of cinnamon ;-) I could eat the topping just like that

You can use regular oats--no problem.  I just made these and all I have are Old Fashioned Oats and they turned out just fine.  I also used 2 cups whole wheat flour, 1/4 cup flax seed meal and I went a head and used the whole egg because I felt like it.  (I would rather eat whole grains and have a little fat then white flour.  I also greesed the muffin pan since another reviewer said the papers stick.

I thought these were really good.  I increased the cinnamon to a 1/2 tsp; I think next time I will add even more. I added a cup of diced apple and just for a little extra fiber I cut back on the flour and added about an 1/8 C of ground flax seed.  They turned out really good!

These turned out really well. I followed the recipe exactly, with the substitution of 1 cup whole wheat flour, and the rest AP,and a bit more cinnamon. When adding the topping it would be helpful to press it in to the batter a bit, as a lot of mine fell off while removing muffins from tin. These are tasty, but a touch plain. They are good as is, or would be the perfect base for any dried fruit (i like craisins), shredded coconut, fresh berries, more spices, or pineapple. Great recipe!

Delicious! I used brummel and brown spread in place of the butter, and changed the amount of cinnamon in the batter. Per previous reviews, upped the amount of cinnamon to 1 Tbsp. It is the perfect amount, to me anyway. Were done in about 25 min. I think they're better while warm, maybe with some milk or cream poured over. It is a simple, quick recipe. Reminds me of apple-cinnamon oatmeal, and had the idea next time to use that instant oatmeal, in the packets...with the little apple bits, or to even chop up some apple next time. Thanks!

As with other reviewers, I added a teaspoon of cinnamon, as well as some nutmeg and 1/4 t salt. I also replaced 3/4 C of the flour with wheat flour. Still very moist and yummy, and the topping is absolutely wonderful!

These were very good and healthy.  I recommend using a greased pan instead of paper liners; there is so little fat that they really stick to the paper.  Will definitely make again :D

Made these for my 9 yr old daughter for a quick breakfast. She loves them with a glass of milk and a banana. Great for grab and go healthy breakfast. I froze half of the batch. Added walnuts to half also. Yummy!

I don't think I did anything wrong, but these didn't turn out well at all. They were rubbery and stuck to the papers too much. Back to the drawing board on this one, folks.

I don't know how others were able to make these muffins and not have them come out dry. I did add 1/4 cup of additional applesauce, another egg white and a 1/4 cup more milk as well as an added teaspoon of vanilla extract. These came out moist with the added "liquid".  Next time, I might add more spice, maybe a teaspoon or two of my homemade apple pie spice. I got 36 mini-muffins out of this recipe exactly. 350* for about 12 minutes was just right.

These are probably the best muffins I ever baked, I made only minor changes, used sugar free apple sauce, and fructose instead of regular glucose sugar and whole wheat flour. I didn't change the cinnamon amount like most reviewers said they did, since cinnamoon can be very overpowering when used in larger amounts, the amount called in the original recipe was perfect in my opinion. I used the whole egg so it has no chance of becoming dry like another reviewer said (eggyolk isn't really that bad for you). I also added a handful of raisins, that was the extra something this muffin needed :) They were moist, sweet, delicious. The topping was nutty and crunchy. Just perfect.

I used steel cut non instant oats and it cooked fine. There was no enough flavor, but very good and hearty. I will use this recipe again, but add a banana or two and more cin.

Great muffin recipe i did however add 1tsp of cinnamon as recommended by other reviews and use 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 3/4cup a.p. flour to add more fiber. Next time i will add some dried fruit to give it more flavor.

These were tasty.  I used a lot more cinnamon (didn't bother to measure), and I didn't add the topping because I didn't want the extra sugar.

Just so so - ok if you are looking for low fat but would be much better if you used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce. I'd up the brown sugar too in the muffin batter to 3/4 cup. Definitely use more than 1/8 tsp. cinnamon. I'd add some vanilla too. I think instead of milk plain yogurt or buttermilk would be better.Chopped up apples would be a good addition. 20 minutes was ample time to bake.

Great! I substituted whole wheat flour entirely, and used old fashioned oats since I didn't have instant. I added a lot more cinnamon (1 teaspoon in the batter and 1 teaspoon in the topping). Otherwise, I followed the recipe completely. We loved them, and you would never know that they were healthy. I will definitely be making this recipe again and again! I have already stashed several in the freezer, for an easy and fast breakfast.

I found these to be a bit dry as written.  I upped the cinnamon to 1 T as suggested by other reviewers.  I also upped the apple sauce to 1 1/2 cups, put a whole egg and reduced the oven temp to 375.  Moist and tasty.

These were dry and a little bland, but this recipe has a lot of potential. I didn't use the topping so next time I will use 1 cup brown sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon, a handful of raisins/craisins and 1 small apple diced. I think they could be baked at 375 for 12-15 minutes.

The muffins are somewhat bland. Mostly they need salt (1/4-1/2 tsp). More cinnamon too (1 & 1/2 tsp). And if you forego the topping they need more brown sugar, i think. I cooked them only 15 min. at 375. My family ate them up!

These muffins were good.  The first time making them they were just ok but then I made them again a 2nd time and they turned out much better.  I changed a few things. Added 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 oil.  Added the whole egg and more brown sugar. And yes, more cinnamon.  Big difference.

I burned these a little bit, but I imagine they'd be great if I hadn't (start checking on them at about 15 minutes so the same doesn't happen to you). I added a full tsp of cinnamon to the batter mix as well as the topping. The topping was a bit loose, so I'd recommend pushing it into the batter a bit when you add it so that it doesn't fall all over the place when you're taking out the muffins. Don't use muffin papers, they'll stick like crazy.

I sprinkled cinnamon on top before baking. Thought these were a bit dry, cooked exactly 20 minutes. They were super easy and I had all ingredients on hand so I give them a 4. The lovely photo you see is my 1st photo upload. :-)

My husband and I really enjoy these - I use old fashioned oats (that's all I have) and omit the topping so I can call them "healthy", but I'll bet they're extra delicious with it.  :)

This recipe is definitely one to use with silicone baking cups - they don't stick to the cups. Otherwise I won't make this recipe again. I thought it was dry and not what I was expecting at all. I liked the texture, flavor was OK with the addition of more spice. My 1 year old is choosing frozen peas and carrots to a fresh muffin. What can I say?

Just ate one hot out of the oven! It was very good! I did add 1 tsp of cinnamon like other reviews suggested and it is a must in my opinion. I also used 3/4 tbsp of cinnamon in the topping mixture. I would like it a tiny bit sweeter next time so I think I will add one apple finally chopped.

I liked these muffins.  They are a little denser than I am used to, but great flavour.  I took the advise of other reviewers and put in 3/4 cup ww flour with 1/2 cup AP and 1 full tsp of cinnamon.  Next time I will try adding some fresh apple, but otherwise very good. Easy to make too, plus I love the smell in the house...mmmmm

I thought these turned out great. Yes, they are healthy so DON"T expect bakery flavor, expect good, natural flavor! I did use a full tsp of cinnamon in both the mixture and the topping and I replaced half of the flour with ww and I added ground flax seed. Still, even making them more "healthy", they were great AND my kids loved them. My 6 yr old had 5 for breakfast and my 4 yr old had 4! I do recommend spraying the pan instead of muffin cups, they stick to the cups pretty good!

I had big expectations for this recipe and was let down.  As many other reviewers have stated there is not a lot of flavor in these muffins.  We covered them with chocolate icing to help the bland flavor.  I took the advice of others and used 1 tsp of cinnamon in both the topping and the mixture.  I used 1 1/2 c of whole wheat flour and 3/4 c of brown sugar.  I even took the advice and added nutmeg to the topping and that still didn't help.  I just hope the kids will eat these in the morning for breakfast.

While the muffins I made were quite moist, I felt they were way too bland and had little flavor. Sorry, I wanted so badly to love them, but they just didn't "wow" me.

Very good muffin. Easy to make. I substituted the flour with whole-wheat flour and used at least a full tsp. of cinnamon. I've got them bagged up and frozen and take out one or two a day for lunch/breakfast. And they are better when they are served warm...

I love this recipe! I did change it up though instead of the 1 1/4 c of all purpose flour I did 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 1/4 all purpose. Also I added a whole tsp of cinnamon instead of 1/8 and they turned out great   I think it would be great to add small chunks of apple to the recipe

Yum! I made these with regular rolled oats (not instant) and they still turned out great.  The whole family loved them.

Yes, they are bouncy but that is because there is no oil in them.  Bakery muffins are tender because they are full of fat.  I happen to be on the "ain't got no money" diet so I was scrabbling around for ideas to use what I have on hand.  I used old-fashioned oats, a whole egg, dried buttermilk powder and home-canned applesauce.  I took the advice to use 1t cinnamon and not use muffin cups.  I had no butter so I just sprinkled a bit of brown sugar right on the batter.  If I'd had raisins or dried blueberries I would have thrown them in.  They taste just fine and will make a great healthy breakfast so I won't starve.

Yum - I ate one straight out of the oven and it was delicious! Make sure to get some topping with each bite. I made as directed except I used a bit more than 1 t of cinnamon in the muffins (next time I'll use more), 1 T for the topping, and whole wheat flour (no white). I baked for about 23 minutes and the outsides were a bit overdone, so I would not do more than 20 next time. Press the topping into the muffins so it doesn't fall off! Thanks for this recipe!

These were great, enough that it made me come do my first review today.  I made them this morning and couldn't wait for them to be ready.  I made a few changes, but I am not sure it was necessary.  I divided the flour the recipe calls for as following: 1/4 cup of Flax seed, 1/2 c whole wheat flour and 1/2 AP flour.  I did it for no other than health purposes and I found the taste to be wonderful, I think next time I will take out the AP all together.  Based on past reviews I was liberal with the cinnamon.  I didn't measure but shook out what seemed right for the dry ingredient mixture.  I also used a buttermilk powder mixture for the milk.  I also doubled the topping, only when I ran out of it after topping about 8 muffins.  I also used splenda brown sugar for the topping.  Since I made the extra topping I really covered them up.  These are going into the freezer for my on the way to work breakfast each morning.  Next time, I will add vanilla to the muffin as well as diced apples.  I will continue to double the topping and cover them up and push more if into the top of the mixture as they oozed and spread over from my first attempt of lots of topping.  I would recommend these to all and it really is healthy and tastes great (is that possible)!

EASY and yummy!  For a non-cook like myself, I was happy to find that this was such a simple recipe.  The second batch I made I added a little white sugar to the topping.

As suggested by several others; I increased tithe cinnamon and was glad I did. I also used ground flax 3/4 cup and whole wheat flour 3/4 cup and added raisins. I also increased the apple sauce slightly and added a teaspoon of water in addition to the milk. They taste hearty and yummy. My 4 year old will eat them and can’t wait to take them to school in her lunch Monday! Will make these again and next time will add cut up apple pieces as another reviewer suggested. Rated 5 with the changes. Thanks for the collaborative effort on this great recipe.

Not sure what happened. Directions are slightly confusing. I would separate the ingredients list and directions for the muffins and the topping. Muffins were way too sweet but lacked flavor even though I added extra cinnamon. They were not the right consistency -almost gluey- and stuck to the muffin cups, so lost half the muffin to the paper.

Delicious!  1/4 cup extra milk, 1/4 cup extra applesauce and full teaspoon of cinnamon really did the trick from previous post.  Kids loved it and healthier to boot so win win.

I needed to use up some homemade applesauce I had sitting in the fridge and I came upon this recipe. There was some good and some bad. They are easy to make and healthier, so I give it 4 stars for that, but not the best tasting/texture. I liked the crumble on top (go figure...brown sugar, butter!) but it was a bit rubbery and lackluster in flavor. I also only needed to bake for 16min. If I make again I'll be doing some adjustments like adding more cinnamon and maybe chunks of apples along with some more spices. Base is good, just needs a little something more.

My family loved these muffins!  I'll definitely be making them on a regular basis!  The only thing I changed was to increase the cinnamon like several people suggested.  They turned out perfect!

When I was young breakfast was oatmeal or eggs.  Nothing sweet because ... breakfast.  So I made these with regular oatmeal soaked in the milk while I put everything else together.  Homemade chunky applesauce with peel, dried cranberries, fresh eggs from my chickens, and 1 tablespoon Vietnamese cinnamon. Quality in, quality out. I didn't throw on the  butter/sugar topping.  Delicious!  Not too sweet, not dry, tasty and easy to make.  I think its a matter of expectations changing over time that this isn't more popular.  Thank you OP.

Delicious and (in a way) nutritous! Love these and will definetly make them again. However, I do agree that you should add at least a teaspoon of cinnamon (luckily I checked before making the recipe). Very delicious considering the very low butter and sugar amounts. Delicious!

These are very tasty muffins, I took a star off because they were dry and crumbly. I'll  try adding another egg next time. I used 1 whole egg. The grandkids really liked them! I used whole wheat flour and added some raisins, I also used 1 teas cinnamon. Next time I'll cut back on the sugar a bit,  1/3 cup brown sugar should be enough. I greased the muffin tin liberally and had no problem with sticking, they all popped right out! This is a nice dense healthy muffin. Great for a quick breakfast.

Turned out dry as cardboard. Thankfully I can fix it by altering the recipe.

I used my MIL 's canned apple pie mix for apple sauce and it worked well. Lacked salt but we're very moist and hearty.

Great!  Added some chopped apple and walnuts.  Also omitted the milk and added extra applesauce for moisture.  Used half whole wheat flour.  Delish and healthy!  Will definately make again!

i made these muffins with my homemade unsweetened apple sauce. i increased the applesauce to 1 1/2 cups and used coconut milk and a whole egg. i liked the crumb topping.  next time i will use more cinnamon and nutmeg.  very moist though with the added apple sauce.

They are very dense muffins.  I like healthy, but I also like soft.

These are a great recipe to use ingredients already in the kitchen.  The inside is soft and moist, but the edges that touched the muffin pan were a bit chewy.  I agree with other reviewers that extra cinnamon and a little nutmeg are nice additions.
