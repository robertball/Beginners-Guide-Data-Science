This recipe goes well with a Mexican themed dinner.  I served this with chicken enchiladas and spanish rice.  It was a hit.  Make sure to bake the corn bread until it is crispy, or it will get too mushy.  For best results, add the corn bread just before serving.

This was excellent. I used a batch of cornbread off the corn meal box, 4 large vine-on tomatoes (can't wait for my garden tomatoes to ripen!!), doubled the cilantro, and only used one avocado. Also had no red wine vinegar so used cider vinegar instead. This is a great recipe to modify for what you have on hand; I can't wait to make it again.

I really liked this. I was making for only me for lunch so I scaled it was down and pretty much just eyeballed everything. I used some green onions that I have instead of the red onion and I left out the cilantro because I didn't have any. Really nice, summery,  simple, and pretty healthy lunch :)

This is AMAZING!! It has such great flavor...I even burnt my cornbread and it was still sooo good. I didnt have red wine vinegar, so I used balsamic and it still turned out amazing! This is a great side dish, lunch or snack. Its my new favorite!!

This was delicious! The sweetness of the cornbread contrasts nicely with the other flavors. I used leftover cornbread I had made and frozen (recipe from this site). I also added some bell pepper (chopped really finely) and a dash of lime juice. It took me a long time to dry out the cornbread (about an hour and a half in the toaster oven) but it was worth it because it had a nice crunch. This recipe is going in my favorites!

This is fantastic as is!  However if you want to make it incredible...add some crumbled bacon.  I've also added a can of rinsed white beans to add some protein for a delicious one dish meal.

Fun way to use up left over cornbread. Amazing salad; just make sure to eat it right after you toss the cornbread with other ingredients, otherwise it will get soggy. Very creative and tasty recipe!

Clever idea--using cornbread!  The dressing can be kicked up a notch; I added mint, strawberries and more vinegar.  My family enjoyed it.

This was very good! I make Panzenella in the summer as one of several dishes that I make to use up those wonderful home grown tomatoes. I'm going to add this to my list! I used a bag of sweet butter cornbread crouton's that I found at the super market instead of making the cornbread from a mix. It saved time and best of all, I didn't have to heat up the oven! The croutons worked just fine I will defanitly make this again.

Very good! I added some balsamic vinegar and I would say that this is a great side dish but not too versatile. Avoid the urge to add more to it and enjoy it for its simplicity. Cilantro does pull it all together, though!

Good and different. The onion was so overpowering, though, so I will do maybe 1/4 rather than 1/2 large red onion next time and I put 3 avocados in, but they were pretty small, and I still couldn't get enough of the taste.  Next time I will put 4 or 5 avocados in, and make them bigger chunks.

I've never had cornbread salad but I know this one isn't true to form. I picked it for the lack of mayo and I'm glad I did. Hubby thought it needed something and added just a bit of Pace Picante sauce. He's a smart man. And please dry out your cornbread cubes before using and let them soak up the vinaigrette for about 10-15 mins. You want them to have a chewy texture, not mushy. :o)

It makes a lot for our little family, but it's so good that we don't want to waste any, so we almost make ourselves sick trying to make sure that there aren't any left overs. This is a family favorite!

Yum. This was so unique, delicious and healthy. It was a very exciting mix of flavors. Next time I will do one tiny thing different to make this even better for my tastes...add a pepper of some sort to spice things up. I love spicy. The cornbread would offset the spicy.   Make sure you listen to the direction about mixing the cornbread in 10 minutes before you serve it...no more, no less.

Great recipe for using up old cornbread. I'd definitely make again. I thought it was a little heavy on the onion--next time, I'll cut that in half. I also used dried cilantro (about 1 T.), and that worked out fine. I mixed the cilantro in with the tomatoes, so it had time to soften up in the juices.

I've been wanting to try making a bread salad for a while. The cornbread bites tasted good but the other flavors were overpowering. I found myself pushing the red onion out of the way!

This was really good, with a few changes, use fresh tomato, instead of steamed, and sweet onion instead of red.
Yum.

I loved this!  My mother gave us ALOT of fresh tomatos out of her garden, so I found this recipe (among others) to use this wonderful bounty.  So happy I ran into this one.

Very light and refreshing.  Nice combo of textures and tastes.  I did add some finely chopped red pepper, and some black beans for a little more protein.  Then added a little romaine around the sides for more crunch.  I think it would have been great without these additions too.

Very flavorful but the cornmeal slightly overwhelms the avocado and tomato.  Overall, very light and fresh!

This salad was great! My daughter took the leftovers for lunch. I will make this again.
