This is a decent base recipe, but I did make several tweaks. First, this soup needs some salt. I also added an extra 1/2 t curry and a tablespoon or so of fresh grated ginger. I think next time, I'll also add some lime juice (didn't have any on hand this time). It's good, but it needs a little kick of something.

This was delicious and easy.  I didn't have quite enough potatoes so I added two sliced carrots, 1/2 c frozen peas, 1 c leftover rice, and a little more curry powder. Super!
