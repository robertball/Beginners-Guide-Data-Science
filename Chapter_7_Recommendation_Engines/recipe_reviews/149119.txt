The eight ingredients starting with the garlic should be mixed together and let sit overnight in the fridge to marinate, the oregano should be 1 tablespoon not one teaspoon (don't be afraid as it mixes through). The entire mixture should be heated through with the melted butter and proceed with the recipe. The garlic and red onion should not be cooked until translucent as this dulls the intensity of the garlic and red onion changing the final flavor. Also shouldn't take as much time as recipe states.

This is a good beginning.  I added a large can of whole tomatoes, chopped, with the vegetables, a 1/2 half cup of virgin olive oil and double the amount of Cilantro and Spices. Instead of half and half, I used white wine.

I altered the recipe a little bit, added Rotel Tomatoes and Chilies.  Put a little kick in it.  I did like this recipe and I will make it again.

Changes I made: I marinated the shrimp in the juice of half a lime for a couple of hours; I cut WAY back on the amount of butter called for; I subbed regular yellow onion for the red, and I used a couple of tbsps of McCormick's Chipotle Chile Pepper powder instead of canned peppers. This turned out great. Thanks!

Another classic that I've held on to. Be careful about the butter and you may want to use less pasta but other than that mmmm!

This was delicious - I omitted the red bell pepper as I had none on hand.  I would make this again, but I think the sauce was not enough for that much linguine so I'd double the sauce and leave everything else as is.

I followed some of the reviewer's suggestions. I sauteed veggies in 1 T butter, doubled onion, oregano, cilantro and chili pepper, used 1 C half & half, and added a can of tomato sauce. Came out pretty darn good!

Tasty, but I think I would have made a roux first as the sauce is a bit thin.  Also, the color is beautiful, but for more variation, add green bell in with the red.

Has good spice. I added a can of stewed tomatoes and changed the linguine to rotini, and changed the red pepper to green pepper. Oh, I also added far more garlic cuz that's what I do ;)

Ok, I'm going to let you in on a very special secret.  First boil your shrimp using a great cajun shrimp boil.  THEN use the same water that you boiled your shrimp in to boil your pasta. This allows the flavor to seep through and through.  And saute all of the vegetables, (we call them seasoning).  Not just the onions, but the bell pepper too.   IN-JOY!!

We liked this one a lot! I guess I didn't follow the recipe too closely but it gave me great ideas as written. I reduced the butter, sauted onion in a couple of TBSP olive oil insetad of butter, added some left over kelbasa to stretch the shrimp, 1 TBSP old bay seasoning powder and some green chilies I had in the freezer and  1C. skim milk instead of 1/2 & 1/2, didn't have cilantro so I added a bit of dried basil and finished it off at the end with a couple TBSP of butter. Husband went for seconds and so did I. it was on the spicy side so becareful if you don't like heat. My husband adds hot sauce to almost everything and he said this didn't need it :)

This was "loved" by my shrimp eater as well as someone who is allergic to shrimp.  How you say?   I did everything the same right up to the part where you put in the half and half and the noodles.  While the shrimp was cooking, I sautéd a cod fillet and added the sautéd vegetable to the cod skillet along with noodles and tossed.  Then completed the rest of the shrimp recipe. I could have added the half and half first, but the non-shrimpy did not want that part either.  I felt like a short-order cook, but it really was not that hard.

This was a great recipe. A strong suggestion would be to double the following ingredients have to more moisture to the pasta : shrimp, lime, chile pepper,oregano,onion and cilantro and half and half

I absolutely loved this.  The only thing I did differently...I think...was to add turkey kielbasa in addition to the shrimp.  (Made it seem even more Cajun that way.)

I was looking for something to do with some imitation crab and this turned out to be perfect.  I added the crab with the half and half, a bit of lemon old bay, and some flour to thicken and served with half the pasta.  Great flavor!

Loved this dish!  I didn't boil the shrimp - just added pre-cooked shrimp at the end.  And I would add more corn and red bell peppers.

This was, by far, the best pasta I've ever had, ever! I used Old Bay Seasoning to boil the shrimp and agree about needing to reduce the butter. I doubled all other ingredients and used Chipotle Pepper Seasoning. Will definitely be making this again!!
