Easy one to make.  Be sure to use cake mix, not fudge mix.  Cut in small pieces, because it is richer than it looks.  It was a big hit at Christmas, and presented well with it's red and green colors.

This dessert was absolutely delicious! And it was so easy to make. I substituted the cool whip with whipping cream and it made it wonderful! My whole family loved this. I will definitely make it again!
