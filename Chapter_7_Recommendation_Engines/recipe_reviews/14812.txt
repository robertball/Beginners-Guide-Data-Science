INSTEAD OF FRESH BASIL AND THE WHOLE SUNDRIED TOMATOES, I USED SUNDRIED TOMATO PESTO.  IT ADDED GREAT FLAVOR, AND I ALSO USED EXTRA CREAM CHEESE AND A FEW SLICES OF MEAT.

This recipe is great.  I served them at a bridal shower and everyone was so impressed.  A little pricey, but absolutely worth every penny.

These were wonderful. They were easy to make. 1 package of tortillas is plenty. I followed instructions exactly & the taste was amazing. The combination of the fresh basil & the sundried tomatoes really made this a hit. I made these 1 day ahead of time, covered them well with saran wrap & they held up nicely. Will definately do again.

I took heed to other reviews that said the basil was too strong, but I didn’t know how strong…so the first time I made this, I used 2-3 oz. of basil, but that was still too powerful.  (In retrospect, I should have gradually added the basil to taste).  The second time I made these, I used just one ¾ oz. package of fresh basil, which seemed perfect.  All my family members liked it (hubby, parents, and siblings).  With this amount, you can taste the basil, but it’s a good mix, not too overpowering, and the amount of cream cheese was adequate.  Good taste!  I did follow one person’s suggestion of putting the basil, sun-dried tomatoes, and cream cheese in a food processor --- this worked out nicely.  *A note about the tortillas: I noticed that the La Mexicana brand tortillas were a little firmer than the Azteca brand.  The Azteca brand seemed to crack/split more easily when rolling since they’re softer, but they still ended up rolling nicely.  It helps if you take the rolls out of the refrigerator maybe an hour before serving to allow the tortillas & cream cheese to soften a bit so the pinwheels aren’t too dry.

These tasted great. I also cut up the sun-dried tomatoes and the basil and used a bit more cream cheese. Everyone thought they were delicious.

I thought this was great.  Everyone loved it and it was light and yummy.  I used Tomatoes in oil and that seemed to give it some moisture to keep it together.  I also used a little more cream cheese at the end of the roll up to use as glue.  P.S.  I sent in the picture that was used!

I made these with deli smoked turkey. One thing to do is NOT substitute the fresh basil with dried. They are two TOTALLY different tastes. I chopped the basil and sprinkled that over instead of using whole leaves. You have to go by "looks" rather than a specific weight/amount. Also, I cut the sundried tomatoes into smaller pieces. This recipe was very good. You could do alot of different things to vary it and it would come out good too.

I was looking for a low carb appetizer, so I skipped the tortillas and just rolled the filling into the ham slices.  I did cut back on the sundried tomatoes a bit, as I often find them too salty.  Everyone enjoyed these, especially when I pulled out the raspberry wasabi mustard for dipping.

This were pretty good but my finished product didn't really resemble the original recipe at all.  I used deli-sliced turkey, cheddar cheese and dried basil.  I spread the tortillas with the cream cheese and sprinkled about 1/8 tsp. of dried basil over the tortilla, layered the turkey, then cheese, then lettuce and topped with the sun-dried tomatoes.  I thought the tomatoes added some nice flavor.  We made these the night before for a bridal shower, covered and sliced them right before the party.  They looked good, kept their shape well and got better with time.  I had one left that I took for lunch 2 days later and it was still great!  This recipe works well with some tweaking.

I have an abundance of fresh basil and have been looking for recipes in which it can be used.  Since I didn't have a kitchen scale, I had difficulty measuring 4 ounces of fresh basil.  I think I used too much because it was overpowering and oftentimes downright bitter.  Also, aside from the strong basil flavor, I thought the pinwheels were "missing something".  My father is the only person in our family who liked them.

These are delicious and were a HUGE hit!  I followed some of the other reviews and used a Sun Dried Tomato Pesto (from this sight) instead of the sun dried tomatoes, I was worried they would be too chewy/hard.  Since I used the pesto, I reduced the fresh basil leaves to 1/2; 2 ounces went in the pest and 2 ounces were sliced and laid on the ham.  This recipe is a definite keeper.

I am giving it a 4 after having made one roll as written.  It was quite good!  Then I decided it needed a few things changed.  I added just enough concentrated garlic into the cream cheese to give it a good, subtle flavor.  I also added in provolone cheese and sliced turkey along with the ham (I used Black Forest).  I wasn't shy with the basil, and they turned out really good!

Good base recipe with lots of room for modifications.  I substituted turkey for the ham in some of them, added provolone cheese and spinach in some, and also drizzled balsamic vinaigrette in them to add a bit more mositure and zest.

I mixed the tomato, cream cheese,and basil together.  It spread really nicely.  I also used proscuitto.  I can't say how good they were since they were gone by the time I was ready to have one!  So by that they are a 5

Great alternative to little finger sandwiches. I used basil pesto instead of fresh basil. Be sure to break the stiff parts off the lettuce before rolling - they tend to tear the tortillas. I took them to a baby shower, and the guests ate them all!

This recipe was great.  Everyone loved it.  I forget to add the lettuce, but it was still good.  I also only used one slice of ham, but I think I'll try 2 next time and more cream cheese.
Very easy to throw together in a hurry.

One of the easiest, tastiest recipes for a snack or appetizer, especially in summer, when you've got lots of basil!  A big hit at my party.

This was a huge hit with my guests. I used herb cream cheese and not nearly so much basil. I chopped both the basil and sun-dried tomatoes (after soaking the latter in water for a few minutes, because they were really hard), then sprinkled them over the cream cheese before adding ham and lettuce. I served them with a raspberry-mustard dipping sauce as someone else had suggested (I mixed Dijon mustard and raspberry jam to taste) and it was a great combination. Oh, I also cut mine into five pieces so they were smaller. Will definitely make again - great recipe!

Phenomenal! These were excellent and very easy to do. I followed some other's advice and cut the sundried tomatoes into small pieces. I then cut up the basil into small pieces with a pair of kitchen scissors. I served these at a party and they were a big hit.

This wasn't a bad recipe very easy to make but i just really didn't like the strong basil taste, i would suggest adding one more package of cream cheese cut back to half a bottle of dried basil try different types of ham like peppered ham It was a very elegant appetizer just wasn't for me , I must say though there was none left after my party, and i hate one or two they grow on you...

This is a great recipe to whip up the night before.  I used roast beef and turkey.  It's also great with regular tomatoes or roasted red peppers.  The basil makes it delicious!  This is a great summertime lunch!

This was really good, but I made some changes. I am not a big fan of sun-dried tomatoes that are bottled from the store. They are usually too oily and I think putting them in there would be too strong. I put the sun dried tomatoes, cream cheese, basil (dried), and some garlic powder in a food processor and mixed it together like a paste. Then I put that as the spread. Then I put the ham, and instead of the red leaf lettuce used baby spinach down on the tortillas. It was exellent!

I've been eating a variation of this for lunch most days for the past couple of weeks. I go through all of the steps but instead of rolling it into pinwheels to serve as appetizers I eat the whole thing as a wrap.
I use low-fat cream cheese so that it's not so fattening. Also, since I'm not slicing it into pinwheels I skip the chilling step (I figure the chilling is just to keep it from falling apart when you are slicing it into rounds). I wouldn't usually think of sundried tomatoes as something to combine with ham, but I really enjoy the combination. And you can't go wrong with cream cheese!

good for what it is - easy finger food. I added some green onion and a little garlic powder and pepper. The basil was a great diversion from the normal roll-up recipes.

My kids are out of school now, and I was looking for something easy to make, wrap and put in the fridge for them, that they can take and run. They really liked these and ate them whole.  One son suggested adding black olives next time.  Very Yummy..thanks Teri!

Easy appetizer.  I used a sun-dried tomato salsa which really gave it a pizza flavor.  Also I only used 2or 3 basil leaves per roll-up.  Delicious!

This is delicious!!!  The lettuce was hard to wrap, so I didn't end up using it after the first two roll-ups.  IT was so good.  I brought it to a party and everyone commented on how good it was!

these are very good but there's no way I could use 4 oz of basil...that's a LOT!  I use several leaves in each roll and I don't use nearly that much.

A very useful recipe for snacks and potlucks. I added a few tablespoons of ranch dressing to the cream cheese to make it a bit more spreadable, and add a bit more seasoning.

The only changes that  I made to this recipe were to blend the cream cheese, basil, and sundried tomatoes together as others suggested, and use some leftover honey baked ham. These were really flavorful and held up well overnight. I used one good sized-bunch of fresh basil and added the whole thing to the spread ( I tasted along the way and found no issue with a strong taste of basil).

This is a good template but needed to be kicked up a little so I added a bit of garlic powder, dijon mustard, lemon zest, salt & pepper to my cream cheese mixture. I fancied it up by using spinach tortillias and prosciutto intead of ham. I also added a tiny bit of shredded Gruyere for added flavor. Drizzle with a little Extra Virgin Olive Oil and you are done.

I have found reading the reviews of a recipe so helpful before I make the recipe!
I really enjoyed both making and eating this one.  I used Tofuyan whole wheat wraps and they worked well with no tearing (they were at room temp).  I used a jar of sun dried tomaotes in oil, dumped it in the food processor and added the basil (in my opinion, there is no such thing as too much basil).  I really like beef with basil, so I used 2 slices of Healthy Choice Roast Beef on each roll up.  They turned out great.  Next time I will drain 1/2 of the oil from the tomatoes and I may skip/reduce the cream cheese.
All in all, a terrific recipe.

This was tasty. I used flour tortillas that were flavored with garlic, fat free cream cheese, turkey and sun dried tomatoes that I rehydrated with water (not oil packed). It was very easy to prepare and tasty to boot. i took it to church for a pre-movie snack for the group. It went over well.

Ham & Fresh Basil Pinwheels' Haiku: "I used less cream cheese, and 'spinach-herb' tortillas. These disappeared fast!" I used 8 8" spinach tortillas and kept the rest of the ingredients' amounts the same, other than reducing the cream cheese drastically - I can't imagine going thru 8 oz. - it would've been like biting thru a layer of cream cheese as its own ingredient in the sandwich, rather than just the tortilla-lube. Definitely worth the splurge to get good quality deli ham, and not pre-packaged stuff. I served these at a party, and they were a delish hit.

I was a little leery whether it would taste right considering I used turkey bacon instead of ham... but it turned out tasty! I drizzled a little olive oil to combine with the basil.  Loved the touch of fresh basil!

These were fantastic, but I took the advice of reviewers and cut down on the basil and used a food processor to mix the cream cheese, tomatoes, and basil for easy spreading. I also used prosciutto ham (about 6 thin slices each rollup)to make them super yummy, but pricey.

These were a hit at my husband company picnic! I now make them once a week for my husband's lunch. I took sun dried tomatos packed in EVOO, and fresh basil and put them in the food processor then spread thinly on top of ham, also used butter lettuce, it's little and easy to fit inside and adds a great flavor!

These are fantastic!  The combination of ham/basil/sun driedtomatoes is perfect. My grocery store was out of fresh basil but they did have some wonderful fresh basil pesto with pine nuts.  I remember reading another rating that said using this was good and it was! I followed the recipe the same otherwise. I will be making these again in a couple of weeks when my college girlfriends and I will be getting together for a kayak trip.  I know they will scarf them down!

Always a hit. This is a never fail recipe. The only thing I add is roasted red pepper. (the kind in the jar) I seems to add that extra punch that it needs and moisture. I make this on quite a bit.

I usually am not a fan of the torilla roll-up style appetizer because they seem overdone.  These were actually very different, tasty, and elegant looking with the leaf lettuce edges.  Not the run-of-the-mill pinwheel.

I blended the sun-dried tomatoes with the cream cheese in a food processor as suggested. I placed whole basil leaves on top the ham because I had beautiful, fresh basil in my garden. They were a hit at the picnic!

I liked these a lot as they are a nice change from the traditional pinwheel ingredients.  I made them for my bunco club, some with and some without the meat. Girls said they liked them but they really didn't disappear...I think I overdid the basil. I also used whipped cream cheese which is much easier to work with and just as tasty. Next time, less basil !

Loved these. They do have a strong basil flavor but I happen to love fresh basil so it was divine to me. You can of course just adjust the amount to preference.  I have no clue how much 4oz of basil is so I just lined each tortilla with the leaves like a blanket. I also used crunchy lettuce and found it to be quite refreshing.  Also make sure to use a tortilla that is chewy because it makes all the difference. I always buy La Banderita for that reason. Nothing worse than a tortilla that that cracks/splits!  Super tasty and very easy to make.  This one is going in my recipe book for sure!

This was so quick and easy! I made this for an appetizer so I changed a few things. First, I only used half the cream cheese and I mixed it in the food processor with the sun dried tomatoes and basil. I didn't use nearly the amount called for in the recipe, but did it to taste really. Maybe 8 basil leaves and 1/3 c. Sun dried tomatoes. I used whole wheat tortillas too. Once they were chilled, I cut them into about 8 pieces per roll, so I got about 24 appetizers from 3 12" tortillas. I'm gonna make the cream cheese again for another party I have this weekend, but I'm gonna try it with salami and add some banana peppers so it's kinda like an antipasto wrap! Thanks for the idea, these turned out great!

I thought these were awesome with the fresh basil.  I used chipole cream cheese instead of regular cream cheese.  It gave them a bite.  They were yummy.

These are good and versatile. A little time consuming, but worth it. I make these for parties or long weekends so we can munch throughout the day with ease. The flavored cream cheese spreads are good to use with this recipe too. Thanks!

Everyone was amazed how easy these were to make.  I did follow other's advice and mixed sundried tomato pesto with the cream cheese to save on time.  Will make again for other get-togethers.

These are alright, but a bit bland - nothing embarrassing but nothing too impressing. I'd suggest using herbed cream cheese, or adding some herbs on your own to spice it up.

These were ok. They were pretty to look at, but we didn't care for the taste. Way too much basil! I took these to a coctail party and everyone who tried them said it was like eating straight basil.  You couldn't even taste the ham. It also needs more cream cheese, too dry.

Very well received at a party.  This was my first attempt at making wraps though and they got better with practice.  Try not to put in too much lettuce because they don't roll up nicely.  I will definately make this again.
