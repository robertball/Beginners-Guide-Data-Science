A nice basic recipe for the grill, that can be tweaked to your personal preferences. Next time I will add a minced garlic clove and/or some additional seasonings for more flavor. 15 minutes would be a little long for my taste...I grilled mine for 10 mins and they were definitely soft but I prefer mine tender-crisp and bright green.
