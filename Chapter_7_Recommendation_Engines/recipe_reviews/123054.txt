Great recipe!  I chopped up some carrots, celery and red onion in the food processor and added them to the cabbage.  Thanks for posting!

What a nice change from the traditional mayo based slaw! This is really good as a topping for sandwiches. It tastes a thousand times better the next day. I added some celery seed and a little extra sugar. I might not use garlic SALT next time, and just use garlic powder and salt to taste. It was just a little too salty for me, but I'm not hugely into salt.

Really good recipe.  East and fast to prepare.  We like the "lightness" and "cripness" with heavy, greasy foods.  I used basil instead of tarragon, but that is just a family preference.

So simple, so delish!  I love this recipe.  The dressing really compliments the flavor of the cabbage.  I used rice vinegar for mine.  Also, I just added all the ingredients separately to the salad, stirred, and refrigerated for a few hours and it turned out just fine.  Fresh ground pepper on top for serving adds a little extra pizazz.

Very nice, refreshing and quick salad.  Perfect accompaniment to the slow cooker BBQ ribs from this site.  The changes I made were cider vinegar instead of plain and celery seed in place of tarragon (I just don't like tarragon and prefer celery seed in my slaws).

I've made this twice now, the second time with some tweaks - apple cider vinegar, 1 tsp of sugar, fresh tarragon, and a heck of a lot less garlic salt. I love garlic, but the recipe as written is extreme in my opinion. Nevertheless, this will be a regular for us with the changes.

Just what I was looking for!  My family doesn't like mayo-based slaws.  I had been using a packet of dry salad dressing mix with oil/vinegar, but don't like the amount of sodium in those packets.  This lets me control the amount of salt.  I added some celery seed.  Very good!

I am not a fan of cabbage at all, but this, I ate it all up, probably for 3 days since I was basically eating it alone.  Never got sick of it.  Delicious.

This is just like the coleslaw we get in the Bar B Q chicken places we have in Montreal.  Now that I am living oversesas, it is a real treat to have something taste like home!  I did not change a thing, and yes it does get getter with time!

This was just so-so to me. I didn't have any tarragon so I used basil. I needed to scale the whole recipe down because I only used a bag of cole slaw mix. I think it wold have been better with cider vinegar and more sugar.

Awesome!!  I too used celery seeds instead of tarragon.  What a great change from a mayo based cole slaw.  Thank you!

Delicious! The perfect accompaniment to our corned beef. I didn't have stewed tomatoes so I subsituted with a can of diced tomatoes instead. Loved it!

I've made this at least six times - it is so different from conventional creamy coleslaw.  I make just as written, except sometimes I use fresh minced garlic instead of garlic salt - need to mince finely and keep the quantity low, or it overwhelms the other flavors.

Tried it and loved it! Great reviews from my lunch guests. Fish and chips and a side of slaw, doesn't get any better. Used a clove of fresh garlic instead of garlic salt and celery seeds instead of tarragon. You work with what you've got! Thanks a bunch for the recipe.
