I hate tuna salad but I love salmon.  I substituted dill for capers and added a little chopped onion.  Yummy!

This was really good. I made the following revisions: I used 4 tablespoons of Mayo with Olive Oil only. I used about 2 T of fresh dill, 1/2 tsp of lemon juice, no capers, 1 cup of chopped celery, 1/8 tsp of garlic powder, and fresh pepper. I also threw in 2 green onions sliced small. Very tasty and now I can get find another use for canned salmon other than salmon cakes! Thanks!

My husband and I loved this recipe!  I used left-over grilled salmon rather than the canned.  I added chopped walnuts, cut back on the celery and capers, and used a couple of shakes of cayenne rather than the black pepper.  I served it on bagels with slices of smoked mozzarella, chopped tomatoes and lettuce.  FABULOUS!!

This was very good!  I avoid tuna and this was a yummy alternative.  I like salmon better than tuna anyway.  I had no plain yogurt so I used light sour cream instead.  I also only used half of the celery, and left out the capers and added dill.  Used Trader Joe's wild Alaskan canned salmon.  Ate as a sandwich on whole-grain bread, with sliced avocados and baby lettuces.  So good!  Next time I might add a dash of lemon juice and some garlic powder.

This is a great basic recipe for Salmon Salad.  I did use a large can of Salmon, drained, removed skin and crushed the bones. I used regular Mayo and unflavored Greek style yogurt. I don't care for capers, per another reviewer suggestion I used 3/4 tsp. of dill.  The dill complimented the tang of the yogurt nicely.  Curry powder would be a nice seasoning for this dish, I would start with 1/2 tsp. then adjust up if needed. 

I served this on artisan bread with red leaf lettuce and sliced tomato.  Cantaloupe was served as well.  A nice Zinfandel, fresh limeade would be a great beverage choice with this one.

It was a little bland as written for my personal taste. I bumped up the flavor with celery seed, finely chopped green onions, dill weed, diced red bell pepper, and sweet salad cubes. I started with a teaspoon of each and adjusted as I went along. I used envelopes of salmon and not canned. I served on whole wheat flatbread, with spring greens on top and a squeeze of lemon.

The use of yogurt here a great idea for lowering calories without sacrificing too much flavor. Wonderful recipe Jessica! Thanks for sharing. 

Question: I bought a can of wild caught pink salmon (my first time buying canned salmon) and was disappointed to find plenty of bones and some skin residues along with the salmon. I suspect this isn't in all canned salmon versions. Can anyone recommend a brand that comes without the bones? 

Thanks in advance.

This was delicious, Jessica. I used leftover salmon from our   Balsamic Glazed Salmon Fillets, (recipe also from this site). 
Only had mayo, added a bit of dill and used Lawry's Seasoned Pepper. Served on a bed of baby lettuce with sliced cucumber, avocado and grape tomatoes around the edge of the dish. Sprinkled with lemon juice. Nice change of pace from tuna, and made for a beautiful presentation. Thanks!

Wonderful.  I love salmon but have never tried it in a salad. The only thing I changed was to add lemon zest and a little lemon juice.  I served this with crusty sour dough bread.  Perfect.

I don't like tuna salad, so this was a good alternative. I used regular mayo and halved the recipe to make 2 servings.

What a nice change from tuna salad.  As you can tell from my reviews, we eat a lot of salmon, so I always make extra to turn into salmon salad.  It doesn't matter if it is Asian Salmon, Salmon with Dijon Mustard Sauce, whatever - - it all tastes great turned into salmon salad!

I have been making salmon salads for years---basic tuna recipes, but I add whatever I feel like and happen to have in the house: avocado, tomato chunks, pasta, green peas (barely cooked), variety of herbs, etc. I ALWAYS crush the bones and have never even noticed them; as others have said, they are an important requirement for those of us with osteoporosis! I never thought to use capers but will try them soon. Another suggestion: this makes a nice pita filling if you don't include pasta.

I made this yesterday and it was fantastic.  I stuffed the salad in a tomato for lunch.  The only change I made was adding chopped red onion.  With plenty left over for lunch today, I decided to change up what was left.  I added some liquid smoke and chopped salted cashews.  WOW.  This was fantastic also.  Very versatile.  Thanks for sharing.

This was good base to start with, my Salmon cans where 6 oz instead of 7 oz, I added a 6 oz. can of Crab Meat (drained) substituted Sour Cream for the Yogurt, omitted the capers and added 2 chopped green onions and 1 tsp. of dried Dill. Served it with Wheat Crackers for a Super Bowl party..BTW there wasn't a drop left.. Kudos to Jessica for submitting the original Recipe..

Loved the recipe just as written. We love capers so they were a perfect choice.  I only have one comment. I do remove the skin, however leaving the bones in (they are soft and crush easily) is a great way to get more calcium and some more of the Omega3 that we all need. My doctor suggested that years ago and we have learned to not mind the bones in the least.

I love salmon but up until now, I have never had salmon salad.  I wasn't wowed by it.  It seems like it needs something; maybe because of the fat free mayo.  I added minced shallot, dill, lemon juice, and finally more capers, tasting and mixing with each new addition.  I served it in pita pockets with mixed greens.

I made this dish @ 2am this morning. I folllowed the receipe exactly with the addition of hard boiled eggs and elbow pasta. I added extra mayo, yogurt, etc to account for additional salmon, pasta and eggs...I like to incorporate the egg yolks into the mayo/yogurt mixture as it adds extra flavor. I was going to make tuna n' macaroni salad which I really didn't want...the salmon I keep on hand was a welcomed susbstitute and a nice change from our usual canned salmon meals. I make salmon croquettes, salmon cakes, scrambled salmon with grits, salmon and seafood patties, and I sometimes just like to eat it as is straight out of the can. This time I was desperate for a change and it turned out well.

Followed the recipe exactly, except I used baked salmon marinated in olive oil, garlic, butter and pepper.  Baked semi frozen salmon filet for 35 min at 400 Degrees.  BF loved it... he sampled it on a rosemary cracker and just raved over and over how good it was.  So now he has a much nicer lunch than tuna fish for the rest of the week.  This really is a fantastic recipe!  Thanks for posting it!

Very good recipe, careful in how much mayo/yogurt you put in though, start out with less and mix until you get the desired consistency so it isn't runny. I did add tomatoes as I like tomatoes in my chicken / tuna salads...yum! served mine in a wrap - a perfect lunch item that isn't the same 'ol same 'ol!

Mine came out a bit too creamy.. maybe next time I'll cut back the mayo/yogurt a smidge. I didnt have celery so I diced cucumber very fine & it seemed to work well. I added some lemon juice right to the salmon (Trader Joes Alaskan-Yum for canned) and a little garlic salt.  I wrapped mine in tortillas with the lettuce so the kids 7,9 & 2 would eat without complaining about the capers, and it worked great!  They gobbled them down!  I will definitely make again and thanks for the great healthful post!

This one was a bit of a surprise. "The Hubbs" mentioned that he was interested in trying salmon rather than tuna salad, so, given my recipe addiction, I went looking, and found this. I made this pretty much "as written" but decided to add just a dash of Old Bay seasoning and (at The Hubbs' request) a little extra mayo. Very nice! Made a very nice change served over a garden salad. Will definitely make this one again. Thanks for the recipe!

I'm learning to love salmon as I do tuna - it's got more omega-3 stuff and less mercury....you know the information. I had a small can of salmon in my pantry that I avoided opening for the longest time...kindof squeamish about opening it. Once I did, I found this AllRecipes salmon salad and really loved it. CAUTION: the first time I made this I used a small (6-7 oz.) can of salmon; it was very similar to canned tuna. The NEXT time, I got enthusiastic about the success and used the large can (around 14-15 oz.)...the contents/salmon in the larger can were FAR less processed....I had to pick out skin and little bits of cartilidge (?) - white bits of whatever. I "soldiered" through, but cringed as I cleaned out the contents to an edible stage.) I substituted fat-free sour cream for the plain yogurt, squirted some lemon juice in, added a little salt (capers bring their own briny-salty taste) and doubled the pepper called for (I love lemon-pepper seasoning....didn't have any). Suggestion - don't be shy adding other veggies to this if you're not going to make an old-fashioned "tuna/or salmon" salad sandwich....I've added sliced radish, grated carrot, diced cucumber...have fun with it (as with tuna salad)!

Only difference was crushing the bones rather than discard.  They're not noticed & loaded with calcium.  Absoutely fantastic.  Thanks for a great idea.

This was great and refreshing!  I had some raw nuts I chopped and added, but what a nice change, and simple to make.  I broiled my salmon in toast oven and then let cool before mixing all ingredients.

This was pretty good, but it didn't have a whole lot of flavor to it (or at least not as much as I'd like). To better suit my own tastes, I think it needs more capers, a little more creaminess, and maybe a splash of vinegar or lemon juice. It's a good starting point, though!

It was OK.  I didn't like the flavor of the yogurt, and next time I would leave out the capers and add chopped green olives.  Add dill.  Was very easy to make with the steam packets of frozen salmon fillet.

Tried w/o capers, but added green onions.  Used parsley and celery salt too.  Would've been great w/ wafer style (water?) crackers or in a croissant.  Yummy alternative to tuna!!

This recipe was wonderful.  I took another viewer's advice by switching capers for dill.  Instead of canned tuna, I used Lime-Marinated Grilled Salmon, also from this site.  It gave it a great flavor.  It was a great change of pace from the standard tuna salad.  Thanks for the outstanding recipe!

This was ok. After making it, I thought it needed more yogurt so I about doubled it. Although I love salmon, I still think this recipe needed something sweet and acidic to cut through the fishiness (especially since it's canned salmon) and add more flavor. Next time I think I will add sliced grapes, diced onions and lemon juice. 
Decent base recipe though.

Tried this recipe verbatim the first time and it was great! Didn't have any mayo the 2nd time, so I substituted Thousand Island instead. Gave it a sweeter flavor and the relish in the dressing was nice. Try it if you're feeling adventurous...

Salmon salad?  More like delicious salad!  But I like to use fish sticks instead of salmon.  Kids love it, it's cheaper, and goes great with Egg Nog.  Love bunches, Luke.

Very good recipe. However, since I didn't have the celery, capers, yogurt or lettuce I substituted cayenne pepper and some wasabi powder for a spicy, "tuna salad" type of dish. Excellent. I also used packaged salmon instead of canned - I will be making this over and over!

This was a basic start to something yummy.  I went with the yoghurt, mayo, salt and pepper but I nixed the celery and replaced it with cucumber -it just seemed to sound a little lighter and more fresh.  I also added some red cayenne pepper to taste, served on a tortilla with a slice of ripe garden tomatoe and a squeeze of ripe lime from our tree -oh so yummy. A faint taste of pico de gallo in our salmon salad made it perfect on the tortilla.  I still think it was missing something.  Maybe I'll add mango next time.  Thanks Jessica for the start to a new favorite.

This is very good... but....  add some finely chopped onion, a few finely chopped pickled jalapeno slices, some chopped sweet pepper (red, yellow orange), a little dill-weed and  some cilantro. Add an avocado cut into small chunks( 1/2 a large or a whole small avocado.) Now substitute half the Mayo with Thousand Island dressing and add the juice from half a small but juicy fresh lemon. .. a pinch of salt, a pinch cyan pepper and you have a creation beyond really good. I did not use yogurt. I used a little extra Thousand Island and Mayo. Serve on a bed of Romaine lettuce. Enough for two large salads.
...IF YOU ARE COUNTING CALORIES... double the lemon add 25 drops liquid stevia, use low cal Mayo and Thousand Island dressing. Then double the amount of Romaine lettuce you wanted to use.   There is enough of this salmon mixture for 4 "calorie counting" girly-salads.

Tried this recipe to have something different to snack on. I didnt have capers so I added about a tablespoon full of diced/minced onion. Also, added about 1 tsp of garlic salt and half tsp of cayenne to give it a little kick. I also did the recommended extra olive oil-mayo.

Came out nice. I would recommend letting it sit in the fridge for an hour.

I really LOVED the flavor, I just don't like the texture of canned salmon so next time I'll chop some fresh, grilled salmon to use. I used full fat mayo, mccormick lemon & pepper seasoning salt, I didn't have onions,celery, or capers. My hubby and kids love it. It's great on toasted hoagie rolls, or with ritz crackers.

This recipe is awesome for any leftover salmon you may have. I love how the yogurt cuts down on the mayo flavor (and the calories!) I added minced green onions into mine.

Like many other reviews I made some personal choice changes. I didn't use capers (don't care for them) but used dill instead.  I used green onions,  yellow peppers and yellow zucchini. I used a combination of mayo, sour cream and plain yogurt.  I served the salad on some lettuce leaves and with fresh buns.  Delicious - will make again.  Great on a hot summer day!

very good but, next time will buy boneless and skinless salmon.  I used two 14oz cans of salmon to make this dish, everyone loved it that was diabetic, no sugar and low salt due to health problems.

I had leftover grilled salmon and this recipe was  very good. I put the salmon salad on an English muffin and was excellent. Thank you.

I made this following the instructions carefully and found it very tasty, but a little bland for my taste. So I doctered it up with 2 tsp. dill, 1 tsp. lemon juice and mustard, and a pinch of Cayenne and black pepper. A good starter recipe as it is very good on its own.

We bought mango marinated salmon filets that were grilled and had two thin leftover filets for the next day. We had slightly more than 7 ozs., so I used the above ingredients and increased all a bit to taste. I also added 1 tbls of crumbled uncured bacon, 1 /2 jalapeno (seeded and finely diced), 1 green onion and we used a spring leaf lettuce. It was a great use of a left over, the adults and kids loved it.

Delicious. I halved the amount of celery and used all mayo instead of yogurt. Plus I used leftover baked salmon.

This recipe is very good. The only thing different I did was add ALOT of extra mayo. I will be using this in place of tuna for sandwiches.
