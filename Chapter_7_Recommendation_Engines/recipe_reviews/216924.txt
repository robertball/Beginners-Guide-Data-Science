No explanation for why this was a total failure for me, especially considering the reviewer preceding me had such success. The problem was particularly in the 2nd step - the egg yolk/Irish Cream mixture did not like being folded into the whipped cream - at this point I already knew this had failed. It was soupy, and there was no way folding in the chocolate (which didn't EVEN want to incorporate, leaving chocolate flecks throughout) or the egg whites was going to remedy that. Unfortunately, it was not salvageable.  In light of the previous review, maybe it was just an "off" baking day for me  (except that I've made mousse countless times...and "beat to stiff peaks"...and "folded" one thing into another...etc.)

This was delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly with a few minor changes.  (1), I used Nestle's semi-sweet mini chocolate chips and reduced the amount of white sugar to about 1/3 cup.  It still very rich and plenty sweet.  And (2), I heated the chocolate chips in a double boiler to avoid burning the chocolate (a glass heat-safe bowl holding the chocolate chips set on top of a saucepan with a small amount of simmering water).  The mousse was set firmly within 4 hours, although it may have set in less time than that, since I didn't check on it.  Using 6 oz. glass custard cups, this recipe makes 8-9 servings.  I will absolutely make this again.

I found this to be a labor intensive recipe based on the number of items you had to blend separately and then carefully fold together. The hardest was trying to get the chocolate to blend with the yolk/cream mixture. I tried to smooth the chocolate by mixing in some of the cream mixture, but it was so thick I felt like it could have used some additional cream in the chocolate to allow it to blend better. While labor intensive, the finished product tasted quite Irish Cream wonderful.

My guests raved at an all ladies party! I've never made mousse before and was worried. It was a light mousse with great flavor. Followed the steps exactly, but used good quality chocolate chips because that is what I had on hand.

I don't often, if ever, write reviews even though I use the recipes alot, but I wanted to let people know this was great and easy.
