There is only one review on this recipe and it is a horrible one yet the person did not state why they felt this was the worst recipe they had ever made. I did make some changes in which I will state what and why here in a minute but first I wanted to point out some red flags in the recipe that I saw right away which might have contributed to the previous negative review. First and foremost 57 minutes cook time on the pasta is way too long and you will end up with mush. Cook your pasta separately as directed on package OR just add it in the last 12-15 minutes of cook time on the soup. Secondly rinse and drain your beans and corn (if you use corn at all and I'll get to that in a minute). Rinsing not only minimizes sodium but it also gets rid of that thick murk canned beans are packed in which will only muddy up your broth. Rinsing your beans also gives you more reason to replace the water in this recipe with low sodium chicken broth for overall more flavor. On that note you need more than a pinch of Italian seasoning and more like 2 teaspoons. Okay so on to my changes. The black eyed peas and corn did not seem to fit to me in this recipe so I chose to leave them out and spend the money I would have spent on Italian sausage. I browned it up real good added all of the fresh veggies and sauteed for a few minutes and then added all other ingredients except for the pasta and peas. I added the raw pasta in the last 15 minutes cook time and the peas in the last 5 minutes of c

There are some important steps missing from this recipe and some serious faux pas. Most soups start with sautéing your small diced aromatic vegetables ie onions and garlic. While I ve see some recipes for pasta fagioli that include carrots my personal recipe does not but if you were to include them dice them small and add with the onions. Sauté until tender. After the vegetable are tender add whatever tomato products you are using for the base tomato sauce diced or crushed tomatoes etc. Some people will add additional liquid in the form of stock. I don t instead I use some of the water the pasta has been cooked in instead. This is also when you add any cooked vegetables like canned beans. Some people rinse the beans to remove some of the sodium. I just buy low sodium beans and add the liquid too because I think it enhances the flavor. It s a personal preference. Do not cook the pasta for 57 minutes. Boil it separately and add it to the soup after the soup has finished cooking. Also black eyed peas green peas and corn are not traditional ingredients. You may add them if you wish though but the soup becomes more of a vegetable soup and less of a pasta and bean soup that traditional pasta fagioli is known to be. I hope this helps others when making pasta fagioli.
