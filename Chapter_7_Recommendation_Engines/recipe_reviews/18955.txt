It was tasty, but I used vanilla yogurt (sometimes strawberry too) instead.  Silken tofu is not the easiest thing to find and I always have yogurt on hand.

very smooth.  It takes a few sips to get used to the taste of the tofu...and then you don't taste it.

Good with silken tofu, but I bet it would be delicious with yogurt instead.

I've been buying tofu to get extra protein into my kids but was looking for a way to get them to eat/drink it without them throwing a fit. This was perfect! I did increase the vanilla flavoring just a touch, but other than that, I made no other changes. The end result was almost exactly like an Orange Julius. The kids absolutely loved it. Next time, I'll take a previous reviewer's advice and not only use silken tofu but I'll chunk it up and freeze it, too. I bet that would make an even smoother and silkier texture for the smoothie.

Yum!  Very refreshing, and so nice to know it's pretty healthy too!  I subbed pineapple juice for oj because it was what I had on had -- worked great.  Will definitely whip this up again soon!

Very tasty recipe. I've started quartering the recipe and freezing the banana and tofu (and usually some strawberries) in ziplock bags for a quick breafast. It doesn't work as well that way but is still quite good. Also good with an extra spash of lemon extract (darn bottles look similar at 5am)

5.15.16   The silken tofu adds texture and creaminess, you really don’t taste the tofu itself (for those who aren’t familiar with tofu).  I did add a little crushed ice, and I’ll probably increase the vanilla next time.  Never had an Orange Julius, so I can’t say if this measures up, but I will say that this is a very nice smoothie.
