I found these muffins to be very dry and low in flavor.  Baked goodies are a treat for me, and I want them to be exceptional.  I would rather stick to my oatmeal for lowfat and have more flavor in my muffins.  Sorry.

These muffins are okay.
I did reduce the baking powder by half (this is still probably more than necessary for 12 muffins) and doubled the cinnamon- both on the advice of other reviewers.
I thought it was interesting that this recipe has no milk, maybe a splash wouldn't hurt.
Also, I used 1/2 golden raisins and 1/2 dried figs instead of the dates.  It was a good choice.
The inside of the muffin is nice and moist, very muffin-like denseness.  However, I slightly overcooked mine. so the outside was a bit chewy.
Thank you for a good way to use up bananas

What a great way to use up bananas in a healthy, high-fibre way. This one's a keeper for me. I baked this in a bundt pan and made it a cake and it was super moist and tasty. I substituted: 1/2 cup sugar with 1/4 cup splenda and 1/4 cup sugar. 1/2 cup margarine with 1/2 cup applesauce. 12 dates with 1/2 cup sliced strawberries.  For 1/12th of the cake, it's 2 points. Can't beat that!!

These were ok. I found myself digging through them just to get to the dates, and the rest of the muffin was just there to hold the dates in place. I subbed applesauce for the margarine, only used 1 T of baking powder because 2 seemed like you'd be able to taste it, and used a mix of whole wheat flour and AP. Not awful, but I won't be making these again.

After reading the previous comment. I decided to add 1/4 cup of butter milk and doubled the quantity of cinnamon. DH says they are great.

These had great flavor.  I didn't have bran cereal so I added flaxseed meal (1/4 c) in its place.  I found them to be a little dry but that may be my fault for using dried dates instead of fresh ones.  I also used maple sugar instead of white sugar and I added in 1/2 tsp of ground ginger.  Next time I'll probably still used the dried dates, but I'll add in 1/2 cup of buttermilk for some moisture.  Still a terrific, healthy muffin!

I only had 2 bananas so used some unsweetened applesauce to supplement. Ground up dates with flax seed and a little water. Used quick oats (1/2 cup) because I didn't have bran cereal. turned out delish!
