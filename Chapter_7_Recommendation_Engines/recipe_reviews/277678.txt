1.19.20  Breakfast sandwiches today for a lazy Sunday morning, and they were good!  This sausage has perfect balance between the sweet maple syrup and a little kick from the red pepper flakes, and when combined with spot on spices, you’re in for a treat.  Admittedly, I’ve been brand loyal to Jimmy Dean® Sausage for years, but this recipe gives it some stiff competition.  Thanks for sharing, very good recipe that definitely will be made again (and again).

Would have given it five stars except it was a little dry. Will make it again.
