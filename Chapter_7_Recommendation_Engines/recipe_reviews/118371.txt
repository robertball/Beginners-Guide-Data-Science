This was AMAZING! I am so glad I tried it. Quizno's used to carry Chicken Corn Chowder and I was obsessed... then they discontinued it and I have not been satisfied since. This was EVER BETTER!! If I could give it 10 stars I would. The only thing I change was I used Green Onions instead of Leeks since my store did not have them. I also left out the hot sauce due to personal taste. Finally, I left out the red pepper and used the frozen southwestern corn in the steamed bags instead that have chopped red peppers in them. Perfect recipe, I will make again and again.

This is an excellent fall dinner!  My husband and children loved it.  I substituted a sweet potato for one of the potatoes and added 1 chopped small acorn squash with the potatoes.  Is great with 2% milk instead of half-n-half.

My husband, who is a very choosy former chef and cooks for us much of the time, said it was the best thing I've ever made and he wished he had a bigger stomach!  The only change I made is one of my favorite shortcuts.  Instead of cutting up and cooking the chicken, I used two large cans of canned chicken, drained and used 2 tablespoons of butter to saute the vegetables since canned chicken is already cooked.  My husband said that I could have used the juice instead of draining the cans, but I was afraid that it would make the chowder too thin.  Since canned chicken is already cooked, I jumped ahead to sauteing the vegetables in 2 tablespoons of butter.

This broth had a GREAT flavor, but I wasn't a huge fan of the chunks of chicken and potatoes (personal preference).  Next time, I think I'll use my immersion blender to blend the potatoes a bit and I'll shred the chicken.  I'll also add even more corn.  This is def worth trying!

This chowder is wonderful!  My husband had three bowls!  The only change I made was to use onion instead of leeks.  Definetely make this soup.

Very good.  I did sub 1 can creamed corn for part of the frozen corn, onion for the leek, and added some minced garlic.  It was filling and great for leftovers!

Overall good, but needed more veggies, corn flavor and definitely pepper.  We'll make this again as it has a good flavor and is good on cold rainy nights but we'll doctor it a bit the second round :)

This chowder was delicious! I omitted the Worchestershire sauce, and added about a half-cup more chicken broth to make it a bit soupier, and it was great. I'd use milk next time just to cut down on fat, but overall it's a terrific winter dinner recipe.

Delish!! Made mine really spicy. =P plenty of room to adjust to your taste: -season chicken with salt & pepper, saute with minced garlic -sub sweet potato/baby yukon/red (cubed sweet potato, and sliced baby yukon & red into 1/8" rounds) -sub 1 can creamed corn & 1 whole kernel corn -sub onion and green onion for the leek - this time i omitted sweet red pepper (not a big deal)- next time I'll add a stalk or two of celery -soy sauce or worcestershire -for hot sauce = 1/4-1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes, 1/2 teaspoon chipotle in adobo sauce, dash chalula -sub milk for 1/2 of the half & half, top with shredded parmesan or motz and serve.

We really enjoyed this & will make it again but I can't say it blew me away. I stuck to recipe but did add more broth, somewhere between 5 & 6 cups total. Served with a side salad & some crusty bread, great on a cold fall/winter day!

Yummy yummy. This soup was awesome and a big hit with the family. The only thing I did different was using an onion instead of leeks cuz I didn't have any. Good just the same. I think next time I might actually increase the hot sauce for a little more kick.

Very good!!  My favorite kind of chowder.  The only differences from the recipe I did was to add a few stalks of celery and pureed a little over half of the soups (before adding the corn and chicken).  I love this recipe, too good!!  Especially fantastic with some shredded cheese on top.

This was absolutely delicious. The only thing I changed was I left out the hot sauce because we are not big fans of spicy foods so I was reluctant to try it.  My husband even commented on how is was very tasty yet something different and that's out of character for him :)

Used one large leek and 2% milk.  We loved it the night I made it, but leftovers were even better.  This is a great soup.

My family gave this chowder two thumbs up.  The hot sauce gives the best little kick to it; pleasing to the adults, yet not to overpowering for the kids.  Will definately make this one again!

This was great as is, easy to make and delicious.  My only deviation was  that I had to make my own chicken broth (with bouillon cubes) so instead of cooking the chicken separately in a skillet, I boiled it with the broth.  On my second batch, I cut it down to one leek, added a small diced onion, and 1/2 tsp of cumin for a Mexican flavor.  It was fantastic!

So delicious!  The whole family loved it and I'll make it over and over again.  I'm not a real paprika fan, so substitued a tsp or so of cumin - highly recommend that!  I had a few jalepenos that had to be used up and they tasted good in there, too.  Enjoy!

My husband and I both thought this recipe was really bland.  I made it as stated and ended up adding about 1 1/2 teaspoons of pepper, 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper, 1 teaspoon of chili powder and 1/2 teaspoon cumin.  It's still not that great.  I agree with other users that there is too much chicken and it would be much better shredded instead of in chunks.  Won't make again.

I now have made this recipe 4 times over the last two winters and it's our hands down favorite soup.  It's got easy basic ingredients, and we have never had to throw any leftovers away.  AMAZING!

I cut this recipe in half because I was not sure how we would like it.  My teen son said that it was the best soup ever.  I did not make any changes except used onion instead of leeks.  I will definitely make this again, this time making the whole recipe.  This is a keeper.

This was a very good soup. I will definitely make it again. I added a couple more cups of corn and an extra potato cuz I love both those. I also didn't put any hot sauce in as I'm not a spicy foods fan and neither is my daughter. Due to adding the extra corn and potatoes I had to add about 1 1/2 cups of extra chicken broth. Yum!

Hmm...it's pretty good, but a bit on the bland side (weird, for something with "zippy" in the title!) If I make it again, I'll probably go a little heavier on the hot pepper sauce and add pepper.  Still, a nice basic fall or winter soup recipe that is suitable for a wide variety of appetites.

Excellent!  My husband and I love this so much I double the recipe every time I make it.  We like a little more hot sauce and I cut back on the chicken a bit, but it is fantastic as is.

I just made this soup and I love it.  It is really flavorful and creamy.  My only regret is that I only had 1 can of corn and it would have been better to have more.  Also, I subbed onion for the leak and an orange pepper for red.  Tasted great!

Good soup! I have always like corn chowders and this also satisfied my love for a little spice in my food. Pretty hearty soup so I would suggest omitting the bread unless you don't want to get off the couch after eating this one.

One of my new favorite soups!! We used kielbasa dices up and sauteed. I didnt have a red pepper but i did use frozen mexican corn and added more chicken stock to reach the thickness my family prefers. Great spice and flavor!

My husband and I both loved this chowder! Total comfort food and very easy to make. My husband doesn't like red pepper so I used 1/2 a carrot instead. I also tripled the potatoes because I needed to use some up, but I cut them into about 1/2 inch cubes and the taste and consistency was fine. I also replaced the half and half with sour cream because that's what I had on hand. If you're using regular chicken broth, you don't need extra salt.  
Tastes great when topped with crushed tortilla chips!

This recipe was good, but nothing special. It seemed a bit bland for my husband and I - definitely very fresh and a nice comfort meal, but a bit disappointing.

This was really tasty.  I boiled the chicken so I would have shredded meat rather than cubed.  I found the chowder to be really thick after adding flour, so I used two cans of corn and added the water it came in, which made the flavor a little too sweet.  I also used about five cups of chicken broth, as others have mentioned.  The hot sauce I used was Sriracha, and I skipped the Worcestershire.  I had to let mine simmer much longer than the recipe called for, because the potatoes took a long time to soften.  I subbed 2% milk for the cream, to lighten it up a bit.  I served the chowder with cheddar biscuits that I also found on this site.  Great dinner!

I went heavy on the corn and added two large potatoes.  Diced everything, including chicken, pretty small.  Added ground pepper.  Really good.

This was to die for!  I did make just a few modifications.  I didn't use leeks, added a green pepper, added cayenne pepper for extra hot spice, cut down on the corn a bit and used fat-free half and half. It was simply amazing even with the fat free half and half.  Will add this one permanently to the recipe book!

This was really yummy!  The cubed chicken didn't get very tender, so next time I am going to try this in the crock pot.  However, the flavor of the broth was delicious and we really enjoyed this soup.

I had really high hopes for this soup!  It wasn't bad, but when made as posted, it was a bit bland and just missing something.  With these changes, I think I'd bump it up to 4 stars:  I ended up throwing in a small can of diced green chiles which was a good addition.  Added some garlic salt too.  I ended up using my potato masher to break up the potatoes for a less chunky texture.  All that said, my husband did compliment it, but I'm not sure if I will make it again.

I would have given this soup five stars, but I ended up having to add so much to give it the flavor I was looking for that I just couldn't. Maybe it would have been better if I'd used leeks, but since I didn't have any, I just used regular onion. I did shred the chicken, as per other reviewers suggestions, and ended up adding 2 1/2 extra teaspoons of hot sauce, a 1/4 tsp cumin and few dashes of cayenne. It didn't have enough liquid so next time I think I'll add more half and half, since I prefer creamy soups. Was a good base, just needed to be kicked up a notch.

A very tasty soup for a weeknight, comes together in a snap.  I baked the chicken in the oven and shredded, then added to the soup.  Other than that I made as written.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Doris.

I discovered this at a church soup supper.   It is fantastic.   To make it more diet friendly, I will use fat free creamer and also use a spray to brown the red pepper.  Instead of browning the flour in butter (which won't be there), I will use cornstarch instead to thicken the soup.

Made this exactly like written, but omitted the leeks, I didn't have any.  Used more onion.  So I guess I didn't do it just as written, huh?  LOL   Anyway, it was a hit on the table. Hubby loved it.  I enjoyed the spicy bite it gives you and the crunchy chips on top! Thanks!

This was a HUGE hit at a football party.  Even the picky meat-only eaters couldn't get enough!  I wouldn't change a thing, except maybe add a few more leeks.

I mad this today. It is very good. I did make a few changes. I used about 4 1/2 cups of chicken broth, I could tell it was going to be too thick. I also added 1 can of cream corn, a jalpeno, 1 stick of celery finely chopped,extra hot sauce& more salt than recipe called for. I thought it needed it, for a little more flavor. I also put 2 gloves of garlic. I put about 1 1/2 cups of half & half. I will definetly make this again.

This was a great starter recipe for what turned out to be an awesome chicken corn chowder!  I did not use leeks.  Instead I used 1 large onion and 3 cloves garlic.  I added cayenne pepper and a jar of salsa to spice it up.  This was great re-heated in the microwave for work lunch!  Enjoy.

This chowder was super easy and SO YUMMY!!!  The only thing I did different was to use smoked paprika (because it was all I had in my spice cabinet) and I think it actually made it better with the nice smokiness.

I just finished my last bowl of this soup & I can't wait to make it again, it was so good! I made a few changes. First, I boiled regular chicken breasts then skinned & deboned them, retaining the stock for the soup. I used onions instead of leeks & fresh corn cut off the cob instead of frozen corn. I might not have used as much hot sauce as it called for because I added a little at a time until it was the right spiciness for me. Yummy!!!

This is wonderful! I did make a few changes based on what I had on hand and what needed to be used up. I added one zucchini, used a kielbasa instead of chicken, and I didn't have any hot sauce so I used 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes instead. Also, halved the butter and left out the salt because sausage is already pretty salty. So, I know I changed a lot of things but I'm SURE based on reviews its great as written, but for those looking for a variation I highly recommend it this way!

This recipie is AMAZING.  My other half devoured it and after when I told him it wasnt a cream based soup, he was speechlesss! I didnt add a couple of things, I sauteed the chicken with some fresh minced garlic, and I used much more flour than the recipie called for to make it much thicker.  Also, at the end I stirred in about a cup of chedder cheese.  I will definitley be making this one many, many more times!

this was really good.  I used left over corn on the cob and left over baked potatoes from a bbq we had.  I also boiled the chicken in the broth instead of cooking it in the pan.  I like poached chicken better.   I think next time I will double the red pepper sauce as I would like it spicier.  My husband called it a bisque and was very happy with it.  I think it is one of my favorite soups now!  Very yummy.

This is a very adaptable recipe.

We made it for four portions. I started by browning 4 strips of bacon in the pot & then setting them aside. The chicken was then cooked in the bacon fat. Didn't have any leeks in the house, so I substitued some green onion. Had a bag of frozen corn with red & green peppers in the freezer, so I used that instead of adding the red pepper. Used 2% milk instead of the half & half. Crumled the bacon strips on top of the chowder when it was served. Came out great!
