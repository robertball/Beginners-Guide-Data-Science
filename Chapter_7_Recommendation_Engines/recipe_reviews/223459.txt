Loved this recipe!  Everyone who has tried it loved it too!  I made it for a gathering of 16 and another of 21, all the women wanted the recipe.  Big hit.  The only thing I changed was the amount of clove, I only used 1/4 tsp.

This chutney has a deep spicy almost exotic flavor unlike the bright fruity tart taste of traditional cranberry sauce. It's a nice change but the amount of cinnamon and spices, even though I like the flavor, felt like it left a coating on my tongue and tasted overcooked. My cranberries cooked in about 12 minutes and next time I make this I will cut back at least the cinnamon to 1.5 teaspoons (to start) and add the spices when I add the apples. I could see adding orange zest to this too. (recipe made for *RECIPE GROUP*).

I zested 1/2 of a lemond the added the juice.  Had some store bought lemonade so added a cup of that instead of water. reversed the allspice and clove just because it looked wrong. I also cut back on both of the sugars because of the sweet lemonade.   This came out so good I used it on turkey , peanutbutter and bread, hell it was so good I took off my shirt and rubbed it on my body.

I added orange zest and juice of one orange. After the chutney had cooked, I lightly smashed the apples with a potato masher. A better presentation , in my estimation!

This recipe is so close to one that I have made for years (and my mother before that) that I am sure it must have originated from the same source.  

My recipe adds 1/2 cup raisins and 1/2 c chopped celery and cuts back the cloves to 1/2 tsp.  It calls for one pound of cranberries instead of a certain number of cups.  I'm sure these changes are just personal preference somewhere along the line!  

I make this every year for both Thanksgiving and Christmas.  Would make it more often if people wouldn't look at me funny trying to find fresh cranberries!

I love this recipe. To add a little more zing, as if you needed it, line your bowl with cream cheese. I use my black bowl, and there is the black, white, and red in the center visual. It is beautiful and tasty! It's great to spread on crackers!

I added a 1/2 cup of orange juice with the zest of one orange and put it in with the apples. I also added 1 tsp of red pepper flakes to give it a kick.

I made this for Recipe Group.  I cut the recipe in half but still used a whole apple. Because I mis-read the directions, I added the apple in at the beginning rather than the end of the cooking process. It still turned out great! We enjoyed the contrast of flavors; sweet, tart and spicy. I made it the day before Thanksgiving and enjoyed the flavor more after it sat in the fridge overnight. Visually, it was a very pretty addition to our Thanksgiving table.

Made according to the recipe exactly. 
 Very good but next time I will reduce the spices by about one-third.  It's just a bit too intense for some people.  The apple really helps it set up, which is a bonus.  I'm not sure there's much apple flavor owing to the spices, though.  Maybe switch out water for apple juice or cider next time?

Flavors are great together. I cut back on sugar and could’ve cut back even more, but I prefer tart over sweet. All in all the flavors are fantastic.

I’ve made this as noted and with crushed walnuts, I love the amount of spices as described. To me the flavors blend well and really taste like the holidays.

I used a 12 oz bag of frozen cranberries since that is what I had on hand.  I cut the white sugar in half and I measure scant amounts on all the spices.
I took this to a dinner with me and everyone loved it.

It was a good start but WAAAY to much clove. I had to add 4 small apples to try and balance it out. Ended up only me and my father eating it. I would only put in a third of the clove at first and then adding to taste how you like it.

Not for me - too dense a spiciness. I like the tart, fresh cranberry flavor better. (But my house did smell terrific!)

I will never use canned cranberry sauce again! Great recipe, easy and delicious.  I adjusted the seasoning amounts as advised by other reviewers.  I added  orange juice and zest.   Left out the cloves, because I didn't have any.  I cooked the sauce about 12 minutes before adding the apple.  Then another 5-8  minutes with the apple.   I ate it with chicken salad for lunch.  Keeper recipe!!!!!

Made this for Recipe Group...I thought this was very good! I only had 1 bag of cranberries, which was about 3 cups, so I adjusted the recipe accordingly (still used 1 apple). This does have a spiciness to it, but I thought it was nice w/ the tart cranberries. It's funny that Linda mentioned in her review about adding the orange zest, b/c that's what I did, and it was a nice compliment to the other flavors. I also liked the thickness of this, but, as Linda also mentioned, mine cooked in less time than stated, so keep an eye on it. We are 'canned' cranberry sauce people, but I had fun making this and would do so again. Thanks for sharing. :)

I really liked this recipe. With all the spices it involves it's full of bold, deep layers of flavor. The only thing I changed was added an extra apple and 1/2 cup of orange juice. Overall though a really great recipe! Thanks for posting!
