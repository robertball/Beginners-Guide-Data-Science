This is a mighty fine recipe... just like Mom's... now some folks on here said something about tough meat.. Well the secret to cooking down tough meat is to seer it first to just brown the outsides... then get out your pressure cooker to cook it down in 20 minutes or less... let it cool down and cook the rest of your ingrediants all together either with the cooker top on or just left open like a regular pot... that tough piece of meat will fall apart and be as tender as you could ever imagine.

Stew meat needs to be cooked at least 2 to 2 1/2 hours. Then it will be tender. Cook meat for about an hour and a half, then add all the vegetables and cook for another hour.

As a true southerner, I would suggest serving this with cornbread and a green salad.  Delicious! Make sure you salt & pepper the meat well before browning.  I also add a few shakes of seasoned salt when adding the tomatoes, Also, just because I like mine a little more soupy, I add some beef broth or water flavored with beef bouillon.  As far as spicing it up,I put a bottle of tabasco pepper sauce on the table for those who like a little more kick.  The tabasco flavor blends perfectly with this stew.  This is the easiest way to please everyone without making it too spicy or too mild.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

I am from the south and I thought this stew was quite bland.  After adding onion, garlic powder, pepper, celery seed was still a little bland, so just threw in a box of Knorr Vegetable Soup Mix, was much better.  Guess I am from the spicy south---

This is a very good recipe.  Great comfort food.  I did flour the meat before browning and it worked well.  Used canola oil instead of butter for browning. I also added a can of beef broth and some baby carrots.  Served with cornbread.  Even better the next day.

This was very tasty, but  seemed like too much tomato.  I  put in one 16 oz. bag of frozen Gumbo mix which has spices in it so it was zingy enough. Next time I will put in more veggies. I think it would be good over rice if you leave out the potatoes.

I give this recipe a 4 instead of 5.   I slow cooked everything in a 7 quart crock-pot. If I had used all of the ingredients, they would have not fit in the pot.  I only used 2 of the 6 cans of stewed tomatoes it calls for and I added a can of tomato sauce.  There should be less okra and more potatoes. The okra can make it slimy.  The recipe is a good one.  I seasoned to taste. Carrots maybe a good add on.

I was short on time, so I used beef broth to get me started.  I also added a little sugar and ketchup because the tomatoes where bitter.
