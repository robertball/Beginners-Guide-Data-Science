Definitely healthier...but cut the oil by half and do half greek yoghurt. I started with the other recipe version that this came from on allrecipes.   Greek yoghurt added protein and kept nice and moist. Half brown sugar and half white for flavor.  Otherwise, followed it completely, and it is great.

I made this gluten free by substituting all the flour for gluten free all purpose flour plus 2 teaspoons of Xanthum Gum.  I also added the zest of one lemon.  It is awesome!

It’s that time of the year where I’m besieged by the horde of zucchinis growing in the garden.  I try to fend them off with any recipe I can find and of course zucchini bread is constantly being baked.  So it’s nice to find a recipe that offers something a little different.  The buckwheat flour adds a subtle change to the ordinary zucchini bread.  The bread is not as moist as most zucchini breads I’ve made, but it has good flavor.
