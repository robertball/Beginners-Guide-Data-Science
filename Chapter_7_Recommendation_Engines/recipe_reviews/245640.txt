My family and I loved it!! It came out perfectly. I followed Laura Reichartz’s advice and cooked it for 5 minutes for each pound @500 degrees. I will be using this recipe again.

This won't let me change my recipe, but baking the roast at 500° for 50 minutes depending upon size, may dry your roast out, it should be 500° for EXACTLY 5 minutes per pound. If they're going to change a recipe, wish they'd do it to make it better, not dryer!
