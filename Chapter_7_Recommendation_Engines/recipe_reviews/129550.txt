This recipe was pretty good, but I did make 2 small changes to it. First, I added fresh minced garlic to the meat and onion mixture before putting the peppers back into the skillet. I also added a tablespoon of flour so that once I added the tomatoes and the water, it would make a thicker "gravy". This was pretty easy and my husband loved it! Thanks.

I've been looking for  this recipe for quite a while.  My mother used to make this and I loved it.  I didn't have round steak so i used the elk steak I had and it was great.  Didn't add water at all just used the juice in the diced tomatoes I added.  Towards the end I added a tablespoon or so of flour to thicken the sauce and also added garlic because I love garlic.

I loved this meal! I added diced tomatoes and made my own gravy for thickness. If you do not know how to make gravy here is what I did: after browning the meat (I did not cook the onions with the meat), I removed everything from the skillet. Then you put oil, onions, and flour in the pan..... keep stirring until the mixture browns. Then pour the natural juices from the steak into the pot while stirring vigorously! Add add extra water to the mixture if you desire thinner gravy or simply more gravy. Then you add your veggies and meat and finish cooking as the directions stated! It was very good

I made this recipe last night and I liked but too sweet for my hubby. Instead I put shrimp in it and some cajun seasoning and came out better. :-)

Made this on a week day night.  It was wonderful.  Used green peppers, but red and yellow ones would add more color.  Served over broad noodles.  Pineapple chunks served as a dessert.

I normally don't like steak because the only ones I've eaten were tough. These were very tender and tasty! Loved it and husband did as well! Thanks so much for sharing.

I made the recipe as it's posted and just felt like it was a bit too sweet and tomato-y for my taste. I'd consider making it again, but I'd have to make so many changes, it'd probably just be a new recipe.

I think this is a good base, no need to add water unless you add beef boullion and corn starch to thicken, (prior to adding to mixture),  because you will end up with soup. I cant do tomatoes, I added 12oz of tomato sauce instead and 1-2 tsp of "Better than beef" boullion. I also used jar of crushed garlic, cooled with beef.
Served over jasmine rice on the sticky side. 
Delish! Unfortunately too hungry to get photo and between me & company, no leftovers. I will make again.

I made this recipe but did a couple of changes - I sautéed the peppers first (they take longer to cook) removed them from the pan and added chopped onion and 3 cloves of crushed garlic then added the meat, I also added 2 beef bouillon cubes and some Worchester sauce and the crushed tomato and it came out thick and delicious

Made this for dinner tonight. I did change it a bit. I know my family and what they eat. Cooked the beef in beef broth after browning to make sure it was tender. Added  sliced onion with the peppers.  Added extra garlic. Family loves garlic.   Every else the same. Family really enjoyed it. Had seconds. Will definitely make again. Thank you for sharing.

I admit to making a boo-boo but this still turned out tender and delicious. I thought I had a can of tomatoes but I didn't! I used a jar of Pace picante sauce and added a few dashes of worchestire sauce and was very pleased with the results. I cut sliced onion into thick rings and sautéed with pepper strips. Very tasty, and this was the first time I've made eye of round steaks (I sliced into strips) and they turned out tender, even without pounding. Will make again!

I really liked that the meat was tender and juicy. I think I will do without the sugar next time and I only had one bell pepper this time. Next time I will have 2 bell peppers.

This was just ok.  It was a little bit too sweet.  I used red, green, yellow peppers and no grated onions,  regular strips like the peppers.  I didn't have crushed tomatoes, so I used a tablespoon of tomato paste. I would make my version again with alot  less sugar.

This recipe was just okay. I also added some garlic and omitted the sugar like other reviews mentioned. My husband liked it, but would have loved more flavor.
