I found this recipe to be a good base for "chocolate fondue with liqueur." I followed others advice- 6 Tbsp. heavy cream & 4 tbsp. of liqueur. I was surprised how easy it really was to do. I made one pot with cherry brandy, one with mint liqueur and one with Irish cream. Couldn’t taste the cinnamon at all so I don’t even know if it is necessary. All 3 fondues received rave reviews and the chocolate kept its consistency nicely within the pots over a low tea light. For dipping- mini cheesecakes, angel food cake squares, potato chips, pretzels, graham cracker sticks, strawberries, bananas, Granny Smith apples, pineapple & dried apricots.

This is a very good fondue, but I do agree with the other reviews.  You must at least double the amount of heavy cream, and add more liquor of your choice.  We enjoyed this fondue and will make it again!

We burned the first two batches, and it seemed that we didn't have enough liquid.  Then we added more creme and kahlua and it smoothed out perfectly, and tasted great.  For people who are trying this for the first time, if it starts to clump add mas liquids pronto...otherwise pretty good.

I made this for my husband last year as a Valentine's Day surprise (after a delicious dinner which was made entirely from recipes on allrecipes.com), and it was a smash hit!  We don't use alcohol in our house, so insead of cherry brandy, I used the juice from the jar of maraschino cherries that I bought as one of the things to dip in the fondue.  It was great!

I made this for a party of fifty and it was super. I used Kahlua instead of brandy, but it was yummy and worked perfectly. I did add some cream, and kahlua as the evening wore on...delicious!

Very quick and simple to make, and quite tasty.  I also had to add extra cream and liquor.  I suspect a crockery pot and a low flame would be best for this fondue - I had to watch the metal pot like a hawk.  We dipped pound cake, angel food cake and bananas - yum.

All I can say is Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!! This was great! I added coffee liqueur instead of the coffee, Baileys instead of Cherry brandy and a little more cream to help smooth it out. If you can't find milk chocolate chips(my grocery store was out)just buy a milk chocolate bar and chop it to make 2 cups. Angel food cake, strawberries and banana were our favourites for dipping!

I was looking for a chocolate fondue recipe for a kids sleepover party and this was just great.  Easy to make, great flavor and all the kids had fun dipping.  I halved the recipe and still had a cup left over - it's rich!

Served this at a couples' bridal shower and it went over great!  It was delicious!!
We used Kahlua instead of cheery brandy.  I gave it a low easiness rating because it
had to be watered down (with Kahlua and more cream) at intervals throughout the party.
It also burns easily if the flame is not regularly attended to- although I am willing to blame
that on my fondue pot.. Overall- it was fantastic.

I used a little Bailey's Irish Cream rather than cherry brandy and it was scrumptious. The entire pot of fondue disappeared in no time at all.

I hate leaving low marks for a recipe, but I just couldn't get this one to work right. I suspect the addition of the coffee may be the cuprit since there's water in it. Each time I've tried this recipe, the smooth, glossy chocolate becomes grainy and unusable (for fondu, at least. Thank God for brownies). I'm going to try one last time soon, leaving out the coffee and then maybe I can redo the rating.  EDIT: Redoing the rating. This recipe works better with no coffee. It causes the chocolate to seize up. I'm sure the coffee flavor could be had with coffee liquor or extract instead, but don't use the real thing unless you like wasting ingredients.

This was sooooo good.  Everyone was stuffed after my dinner party and didn't want dessert...until I brought this out.  6 people ate almost all of this!  I used 3 tablespoons regular brandy and 2 teaspoons maraschino cherry juice since I didn't have cherry brandy.  6 tablespoons of heavy cream and a bit more cinnamon than the recipe called for.  They all thought I used an expensive chocolate.  I told them it was French chocolate...Nestle, LOL

We loved this. It is simple to whip together - I had my 12 year old in charge of its creation.  We used blackberry brandy.  The coffee is a perfect compliment to the sweetness of the milk chocolate, and the consistency was just right for fondue dipping.

I think the key here is to cook on very low heat (no higher than low-medium), and to stir constantly - this will help the chocolate smooth out perfectly, and not chunk up and burn. Adding too much liquid definetly alters the flavor and structure of the chocolate - using oils makes the chocolate runny, using milk will make the chocolate sticky (and sometimes milk will prevent the chocolate from hardening properly for making chocolate covered fruit). I use Lindt chocolates, they're expensive but  good. In my experience, most chocolates melt perfectly when given the time to do so, and without additives like liquor or cream.

Made this on Valentines Day.  Huge hit with all.  I just used regular brandy -- and it tasted great.  Served with the usual fruits, but included dried pineapple.   Will make again.

This was really good, but the coffee favor was quite strong. Next time I think we'll use 1/2 the amount the recipe calls for.

This had a great flavor and it was easy to make! My only thought was that you really had to keep stiring this dip to keep it from hardening. I did not use the brandy because I did not have any on hand, instead I followed the recipe exactly and added an additional 2 tbsp of the heavy cream to make up for the brandy that was left out. I will definitely make this again! I served this with strawberries, pretzels, and marshmellows.

We made 3 different chocolate fondue recipes from this site.  This was THE BEST!  I did add more cream and a little more brandy.  Very good!  Thanks for the recipe.

OUTSTANDING! I doubled the recipe then followed it exactly-except I precooked everything on the stove then put in a microwave dish-I wanted to have it somewhat ready for several hours later When the time came I put it in the Microwave for 3 minutes on 40% power twice. Stirred then finished it off in the crock pot!! I served it with oranges, pretzles, pound cake, strawberries, and pineapple.

This came out really well, I used about 6 TBS of heavy cream and used Kahula instead of what was listed. I cooked it on the stove until it was thin and then put it in the fondue. We dipped, marshmellows, fresh pineapple, strawberries. I used a hershey kiss fondue set (a christmas gift) and it actually was bubbling. You will need to stir it then.. it can burn a little in the middle. But I liked this recipe, next time I would use choc chip instead of semi sweet, that is a little over powering to eat and I love dark chocolate. next time I would use pretzels, apples and kiwi and I have heard cream cheese cubes are fabulous!!!

First time I made this, it was great.  Second time I didn't refer to the recipe until I started having issues!!  The extra cream is essential!!  If you melt your chocolate and it appears grainy or the texture isn't smooth, add more cream & liquer (I used Bailey's) and whisk.  It will smooth out and be great!!

Only change was used Amaretto instead of Brandy, also forgot the cinnamon.  Made it stove top for a couple minutes then transferred.  Kept stirring in the fondue pot and was a bit concerned because it took at least 5 minutes to get completely melty and not be so grainy.  5 stars for flavor and did very well in our electric fondue pot.  This was also our first homemade chocolate fondue so we couldn't have asked for better results!

This is a great chocolate fondue recipe!  A big hit for our New Year's Eve gathering!  We substituted Bailey's for the Cherry Brandy and it turned out perfect.  Doubled the recipe and didn't add any additional cream or Bailey's to the chocolate.  We melted in saucepan on the stove and then transferred to fondue pot.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I loved this recipe...quick, easy and a big hit with my dinner guests.  THe only suggestion I have is to add a little more milk...it was a bit thick and very sweet.  The kids loved it of course, but the adults couldn't really handle it!

This recipe was easy and great! I added more cream than it calls for, and used half milk chocolate and half dark chocolate and it was delicious and creamy. The cinnamon is a nice touch! The perfect dessert to end a Valentine's Day dinner :)

My husband and I used this as a basic recipe and made some changes.  We used a toblerone bar as part of the chocolate and augmented with Semi-Sweet morsels.  We added Chocolate Hazelnut liquer for the Cherry Brandy and Kahlua for coffee.  It was amazing!

We left out the coffee and it was still so very good.  Leftovers were used for ice cream topping.  Yummy.

Very good recipe!  I made a few changes which worked well: I used Kahlua instead of the cherry brandy and a 50/50 mix of semi-sweet and 60% cacao chips.  I used some instant coffee ground and just mixed it in instead of brewing coffee and left out the cinnamon.  Last but not least, I doubled the cream and alcohol to make it a little more smooth.  All in all, definitely a keeper!

Very romantic and delicious!  I made this on valentines day for my boyfriend.  It was extremely easy to make only took a couple min. to melt together.  Next time I will put a little more liqueur in it because you couldnt taste it at all.  The chocolate hides the flavor.  I served it with some little cheesecake bites, big marshmallows, small pieces of angel food cake, strawberries, bananas, and graham cracker sticks.  I will definately make again!

Add my vote to all the others!  This was great!  I used Amaretto (4 Tbsp) and increased the cream to 6 Tbsp.  It was really great and veerrrry well received.  Next time, though, I'll melt everything first in a saucepan on top of the stove.  It took waaayyy toooo long to melt and meld in the fondue pot.

Everyone loved this fondue!  I used Bailey's instead of the brandy.  With the Rival electric fondue pot, I had to keep the temperature knob on "warm" only or it immediately became too hot.  It was ready to serve in 5 minutes.

This was really good!  The only change I mad was to replace the coffee with Kahlua.  I used pieces of chiffon cake and sliced bananas, but am looking forward to spring when strawberries return to Japanese supermarkets...

Very tasty! Very easy and everybody loves it. I had to add extra cream and brandy to counter the gooey-rich thickness of this recipe but that's hardly a complaint.

MMMMMM!!  This recipe was very good.  I used kahluah in place of brandy.  It was very good, my kids ate it till it was gone.  It's fun to do for a family night.  I bought coconut marshmallows, pound cake and bananas.  It was delicious. I did have to add a little more cream.

This is a great starting point for a chocolate fondue recipe.  I omitted the cinnamon and coffee and used mint Bailey's instead of cherry brandy.  As others suggested, I doubled the amount of heavy cream (plus a little more towards the end.)

This is THE dessert fondue!!!! I made this for a couples dessert get together on Valentine's and not a one of us could quit eating it! I made one small change, instead of cherry brandy I used 1 1/2 Tbls. cherry extract and 1/2 Tbls. Rum extract!!! Still the best yet! If your looking for a really special, memorable chocolate fondue - This is IT!!!

What a hit. This was the first time I've ever made fondue and it was yummy, everyone loved it. I followed some of the suggestions from the reviews, like adding 6 tble of milk instead of 3. I didn't use coffee because I was running late and didn't have time, I used regular brandy, instead of cherry. thanks for the recipe.

Loved it! I used ghiradelli's double chocolate dipping chocolate (you can get 2.5 lb blocks very reasonable @ Sam's) & I didn't have cherry brandy so I used a tbp of brandy & a tbp of grenadine. Next time I will add anorther tbp of brandy but since my grandsons were enjoying this w/ us, I was leery of using anymore. I heated it up in my fondue pot, over a pot of simmering water & when it was melted, I moved the fondue pot to the table. Served it w/ chunks of pound cake, halved strwaberries, thick banana slices, lrg marshmallows, clementine sections & granny smith apple slices....I think I found my happy place! LOL

I love this recipe.  I did add some extra cream, and I couldn't find cherry brandy, so I took regular brandy and added grenadine.  It turned out fabulous.  We ran out of fruit and the chocaholics were eating it with a spoon!

I served this recipe as the dssert for my complete fondue dinner party, and not only did it finish off the meal beautifully, it was delicious as well! I actually didn't want to buy a whole bottle of cherry brandy, so I used Kaluah, and it was great. My guests loved it, and my friend who only knows how to make cereal for dinner even thinks she'll give it a try after watching me make it!

Excellent fondue! I had no problems with the burning... just melted everything on the stove over medium heat and it turned out fine. All I had was raspberry liqueur and it substituted fine. Will definitely serve this one again!

I used 6 tbsp of cream, per other reviewer suggestions, but I probably only use 4 tbsp next time.  I did not use any of the other ingredients, because my husband preferred just the chocolate flavor.  Maybe next time we will be adventurous!

I added Baileys Irish Cream and it was great. I served it with fruit, marshmellows, sponge cake and cream puffs. Everyone loved it.

Made this for Superbowl '09, it was a hit.  I made it with a pre-made mudslide liqueur instead. The only problem was no one could get the chocolate to stick.  I adjusted the temp of the  fondue pot to see if that would help and it didn't.  Any suggestions?  It doesn't really matter though I will be making this again...it tasted sooooo good! Thanks for the recipe@

This recipe is very rich. It was chocolatey and had good taste. It seperated and became oily, don't think I'd made again.

The cherry brandy in here gave it a very nice flavor. I thought this was one of the best fondue recipes I have ever made, and of course with fondue in general, very easy!
