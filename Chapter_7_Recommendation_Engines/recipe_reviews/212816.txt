Phenomenal recipe! My first time making latkes on my own and all my guests were raving. I don't own a food processor so I peeled and grated the potatoes and onion. I added a couple of dashes of pepper and garlic powder. The recipe made a lot, depending on how big your latkes are. I even sent someone home with the recipe. This is a holiday staple recipe for us now.

This was great! My family loved it. I think I needed more potatoes. My batter was too thin and I struggled a little bit. Next time I will make sure I have a thicker consistency. But even with that, it was great. Thank you for a great dish.

Finally, perfect latkes! A few adjustments: I used 5 smallish russet potatoes and left the skins on, 1 egg and added black pepper to the mix. I did not squeeze the grated potatoes. The potatoes juices pooled at the bottom of the mixing bowl. I used a 1/3 cup measuring cup. This recipe gave me 8 uniformed patties. Fried for approximately 4 mins. each side. Terrific with our beef polska keilbasa and saurkraut. Don't forget the homemade applesauce and sour cream!

Very good! I didn't bother cubing the spuds since they were going to be processed. I quartered them and it worked fine. I also only used about 1 thick slice of onion, and that was enough. These turned out quite delicious with sour cream and bacon bits. Be warned, though: don't prepare this too far in advance as the potatoes will start to brown. It still tastes fine (at least to me), but it looks a little less yummy. Thanks for sharing, Basg!

Very tasty and easy to make.  I doubled the recipe but not the onions.  I like the taste of onions but I thought that 2 onions was too much.  I used 1 medium size onion...about 2 inches in diameter.  It was just enough flavoring.

Great and simple! The Commenter above may have used too large of an onion, or too small potatoes. I used very large potatoes and a medium red onion (I also added crumbled bacon) and I thought they were very good

The recipe was perfect.  I lost my original recipe that I had for years and printed this one out.  perfect.  A few minor changes though.  I let the potato/onion mixture sit in a colander and I push the liquid out.  Than i let the potatoe water sit for 5 minutes so it becomes sediment (potato starch) and I add that to the mix as well.  Also, I added more salt and definitely pepper.  Soooo good!!

These were delicious, and my kids loved them! I did follow the advice of previous posters, and I only used 1 egg. Instead of latkes, I made them the size of falafels, which allowed them to fry faster. I probably got about 20-25 from this recipe. Easy and quick!

I consider this the best recipie, not too much eggyness so the potato really gets to star. Minced onion can easily be substituted if you don't want to cut a fresh one

Scaled the recipe to 1 1/2 times, since I had 6 potatoes to use. Still used 1 onion since it was fairly large. The mixture was wetter than I would have liked, so next time I will run the potato, onion & salt through the food processor, then let the mixture drip in a colander (or squeeze through cheesecloth) as per similar recipes before adding the remaining ingredients. This recipe is easier to use than ones that give you a volume measurement of the grated/minced/chopped vegetables.

Too salty for our taste, if I made this again, I would reduce the salt to 1 tsp.  I also prefer my potatoes shredded, so I shredded them in my food processor and used 1/2 a large onion chopped in the food processor.  Very tasty with applesauce.

Overall good recipe.  The next time I make it I will use the method of squeezing the potatoes and onions in cheesecloth to remove excess liquid.  The flavor of this recipe is wonderful.  The excess liquid needs to be squeezed out first, then the consistency of the batter is perfect.

This didnt turn out for me :( It was way too runny. I added more potatoes and flour but it didn't work, and my food processor was overfull.

Delicious, easy and oh so traditional! The mixture is quite ‘runny’ which ensures that the latkes are not too high in the pan, and thus cook through well! A winner!!

Way too runny.  You'll have to ring out the potatoes before you mix.  Wasn't so foolproof if this moron messed it up.

Great recipe!  My Mom was from Czechoslovakia and came to America after World War 11.  She made the best latkes, crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. I substituted matzo meal for the flour and they were perfect.  A big secret is not crowding the frying pan.  Also, use medium sized potatoes.

These were wonderful!  Better than any I've ever had - the addition of baking soda is a new twist for me  and I think that's what helped  make these so special.   We ate half of them and froze the other half, I hope they reheat well.  Can't wait to make these for company - not only are they delicious they are also super easy to make, another big plus in my book!  (BTW I'm adding this a couple of weeks later - I rehated the frozen patties by wrapping them in foil in a 350 degree oven for about 20 minutes, then broiling them for about 5 minutes.  Turned out perfect -tasted like they were just made!)

These tasted ok, but the texture was nowhere near what latkes should be. They were more like regular pancakes. They were certainly faster to make than the latkes I'm used to. If I were to make them again, I would certainly give them a LOT less time in the food processor, to keep them chunky. Even so, though, I don't see a way to completely dry them before frying, so they would not be crispy.

Good recipe but I suggest you cut the salt by half.
