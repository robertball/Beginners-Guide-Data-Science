I won first place with this recipe!  I did not do the jam-thing, instead I pressed a Peanut butter cup to the center at about 7 minutes into baking and I WAS A BIGTIME WINNER WITH MY CO-WORKERS..THANK YOU!

I added a pinch of baking powder after reading the reviews on how they didn't spread out and these came out beautiful. I also dipped them in beaten egg whites and then rolled in crushed up peanuts. I then just used choc. chips in the center and red raspberry preserves and returned to the oven for one minute. They came out great with my changes!

Great recipe. I made balls of dough and dipped them in a cinnamon&sugar mixture before baking.. added just a little more sweetness as I had run out of jam.

Easy to make but rather dull, ...they do not expand during baking and the texture is sort of cardboardy (I can't think of another way to describe it).  They needed more peanut butter flavor.  I filled mine with melted chocolate.

These were amazing!  I did the first dozen with melted chocolate chips (35s in the microwave with a touch of butter)... they did not make it to the photo though!!  Thanks for this recipe... A new family tradition at our house!

This is a great recipe...I used raspberry preserves and strawberry jam on a few dozen each, then drizzled the tops with melted white chocolate..awesome!  Thanks for this easy cookie dough recipe!

I'd give this recipe 10 stars if I could. What a fantastic idea! I've renamed them 'PB&J cookies'.  They actually taste like a bite of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  I have no idea why other reviews were so bad. 'Cardboard' taste?  Hardly!  They're perfect.  I also filled some w/melted chocolate.  'Reese's cookies'.  A new tradition for the holidays!!!!

i doubled the recipe, planning to use it as hostess gifts.  that should have made 6 dozen according to the recipe, but i only got about 4 1/2, which wasn't enough.  also, i found the texture dry and not peanut butter-y enough.  it was ok, but i wouldn't use this recipe again.

Wonderful cookies and very easy !  I used butter flavored Crisco and it worked great.  I filled them with jam but you can really use your imagination with theses as so many things go great with peanut butter.  The peaunt butter cups are great too for the center but they would be great too with a soft fudge center.  Highly recommend this recipe !!

I did just as the recipe said to do. I made an impression in the cookies before baking.. THEY SPRED OUT... I went back online and find another recipe that siad to make the impression after baking.. I did that with the rest of the cookies and they turned out just fine.. Also.. these cookies are not sweet enough to my likeing. Should have used my old time recipe, From Betty Crocker cookie book..

OK.  I found the taste to be rather bland and I didn't care for the texture.  It's a good thing that it called for jam because it saved the cookie.

I was excited to use this recipe because I thought it was something my 3-year old daughter would enjoy making with me.  But they tasted awful!  I don't know if I did something wrong, I'm sure I followed the recipe closely.  They had no flavor and a weird texture.

I didn't like this cookie at all!  The taste wasn't what I expected (very bland). I will NOT make this again.

My niece and I were enjoying our friday evening.  This was a great recipe for kids especially!  She is in the first grade and she went over measuring this week.  We used sugarless preserves and we want to make a batch with splenda for her diabetic dad. :)

The taste would have been better with more peanut butter, but it was a great choice to make for my son's 3rd grade class party.  It made about 5 dozen cookies, and his class of 18 students and 2 teachers finished off all but 4 of them!
