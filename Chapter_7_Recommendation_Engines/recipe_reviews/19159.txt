I made this for the students in my class and we all loved it.  I still make a batch when the sweet-salt cravings hit and this mix satisfies those cravings.

I make similar to this all the time, using odds and ends of almost empty boxes - last bits of cereal, any type of cracker, broken up cookies, small handful of baking chips... Daughter never knows what to expect and she loves it! And it uses up stuff that would otherwise sit uneaten because no one EVER seems to want the last serving of something.

Very nice...I like the fact that this is a no nut mix and is perfect for serving to students.  I also through in some cheerios and used pretzel goldfish as well as cheddar  goldfish which the younger kids love!  Served with coloured M&M according to holdiday.  I also add mixed nuts to my families mix...peanuts, almonds and cashews are the big hits.

Kids' Party Mix Haiku: "Crunchy, salty, sweet. (Although I like to add nuts.) For kids, it's perfect." It was a lazy movie afternoon and we were out of popcorn, but had a mixey-uppey pantry of the remnants of everything that this party mix consisted of, so it was a nice snack to nibble on. I like that, unlike so many snack mixes that require baking in butter and spices, that this is just measure, pour, eat, but I think the ratio of ingredients should increase the cheese crackers by a bit.

I was looking for a no nut snack mix to take to Sunday School.  This fit the bill perfectly.  Thanks for posting, it helped to have all the measurements.

I made this for my daughter's birthday party along with a few other snacky-appetizer items.  This one was the first one everyone went for and was gone in a flash.

I love how easy this is to make. I'm making it for my grandson's big water slide birthday party. Thought it would go along with the theme to serve it in sand buckets with shovels. ***Update after party - this was a big hit with parents and kids.
