4.5 stars - Not toothsplitting, but very tasty!  I was hoping for the hardness of the cheap gingersnap cookies that you can pick up at the supermarket, but these turned out more chewy, even after "rebaking" them to dry out.  The amount of ginger was perfect; I love ginger, so I will probably add more in the future.  Molasses is super-expensive where I live overseas, so 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1 Tbsp. water did the trick.  No self-rising flour here, so I added some baking powder.  Will be making these again for sure!  Great with a strong black tea.

Awesome ginger cookies! I made these as a quick and easy dessert to compliment a Moroccan meal I made. Easy and delicious! I was pleased with the little crunchy little chewy texture!

Very good!  I added 2 teaspoons of Cardemom to it, but besides that, no changes.  When I put them back in the oven to dry, they were on a cookie rack so the bottoms would dry out as well.  They were crunchy.  And addicting!  Don't balk at the amount of ginger. They are, after all, ginger cookies!!!!
