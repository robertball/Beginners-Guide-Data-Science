09.17.16 ~ What a great dish!  This recipe was so delicious and easy to make.  I had a package of boneless ribs in the freezer and they worked great for this recipe.  The sauce does come out sticky, just as the title states.  We had homemade rolls,  'Cran-Broccoli Salad', 'Buttery New Potatoes with Leeks and Parsley' and 'Rhubarb-Raspberry Crunch' to go with the ribs.  All the recipes are found on AR.  We had an awesome meal.  Thanks SUNKIST2, for sharing your recipe.  It will be used again.

Can easily be converted to work with your Instant Pot.  Delicious ribs!  I cooked the ribs first in the Instant Pot.  Put the cooked ribs on a cookie sheet.  Added the pineapple sauce over the ribs.  Baked at 400 degrees for 15 minutes.

I haven’t made them yet but i always bake ribs at 250 as I found that temp makes them the most tender. I will try it that way then increase to 400  for last 20 mins to  caramelize the sauce. Also if you line the baking dish with foil first, clean up is so easy!

Great recipe, I was afraid the sauce would be too sweet, but it was perfect.  Made the sauce exactly as stated in recipe.  However I cooked this in the slow cooker, about 6 hours on low, since I know for sure it will fall off the bone that way.  Once done, I removed the ribs, and placed the sauce in a pan, skimmed off the fat and boiled it for about 30 minutes to thicken up.  Then added some cornstarch slurry to really thicken it up, and poured back over the ribs.  Will definitely make again.

This was a very simple recipe, in spite of a long list of ingredients.  I have made the sauce an entire 24 hours ahead of time, refrigerated, and then spread it over the ribs prior to baking.  If you follow the time instructions, your ribs will come out juicy, tender, and delicious.  I have tried broiling them for the last 5 minutes to give them a crusty top and that seems to make a good dish even better.  Great recipe, thank you.

I've made this sauce before and loved it just the way it was but do agree with one reviewer who said they cooked the ribs at 250 for a little longer. Hubs and I felt they were just a bit tougher cooked at 350. The second time I made it,  my daughter-in-law was coming and she doesn't like pineapple so I used orange juice and orange zest. The flavor was good but a little less intense so I simmered the sauce and reduced it by at least half. It was really good. Also a bit of corn starch or arrowroot could be used to thickness it.

I made these for a barbecue. They lasted about five minutes. Fall off the bone tender. I used pineapple chunks instead of tidbits and those went almost as quickly. I also used a larger amount of pineapple (12.5 Oz.)

I didn't have any ribs - I used boneless chicken thighs.  They were GREAT.  I served them with rice & salad.  It wasn't a week later before my husband asked for them again.

The ribs were a big hit. I added dried basil, sweet baby rays Hawaiian bbq sauce and sweet chili sauce and used apricot pineapple jam. Will definitely make this again.

The meat fell off the bone and was so tender! I would feel like that this would be better maybe taking this out 15 mins earlier than what has been said. Nethertheless, this was a treat worth having!

Just suggest the following:

Do everything the day before and put in fridge over nite.
DON’T PUT FOIL IN PAN...JUICES BEST UNDERNEATH.
Be sure to put in middle to one above in oven.

Otherwise great RIBS

Great recipe.  Never though of using spareribs with this glaze. I have done a similar recipe for years using pork tenderloin rather than ribs.  Trick is to cut a slit in the top of the pork tenderloin, along the entire length. Stuff the slit with:  Stove Top Stuffing made using a little orange juice or apricot nector and a touch of dry mustard.  Then pour glaze over the top of the stuffed tenderloin  and bake for about 40 minutes at 350 degrees.  This apricot glaze is great. Note:  orange marmalade can also be substituted for the apricot jam

I made the sauce exactly as written.  Before pouring  it over the ribs I tasted and  felt it would be a bit too mild for our taste so I added 1/8 teaspoon extra  cayenne.  It was perfect!  The ribs were fork tender after baking at 350 for an hour and a half as written.  Thanks!  It's a keeper!

These were delicious. I did a few things differently. I blended the marinade in a food processor. I preferred not to go for a chunky sauce. When they were done in the oven, they were very wet from the juices and marinade they were basting in so I threw them on the grill for 5 minutes or less just to give them a bark. The results were terrific.

This was absolutely delicious! I altered it slightly.  I left out the Cheyenne pepper and garlic, because my mom has allergies to several spice and herbs. We all had second helpings which we rarely do.  Have made twice now and see it becoming a regular part of our monthly meal plan.

These baby back ribs with Apricot BBQ sauce was so delicious and so easy to make. I got the ribs at Costco and their meat is always good. So the combination was  great. I will definitely make this again.

Needs work: added 4 cloves garlic... will add 6 Garlic cloves, 1 Tbsp of ginger powder, and Teriyaki instead of soy for sweetness next time. Cooking time and basting I cut to 30 minutes instead of 15 so heat can build. Done in 1.5 hours. Rested 15 minutes.

This looked good but. I followed the recipe as written. It was fat to sweet and it NEVER thickened. Very disappointing as I usually enjoy your recipes.

I couldn’t find apricot jam, only apricot preserves which is chunkier. I didn’t want chunky fruit on my ribs so I threw everything in my blender & made a sauce with it. It turned out great! Delicious flavor! And they were very moist & tender!

Very good recipe. I would slow down the cook time next time though to make the ribs more tender. Basting is very, very important. The sauce is thin at first but keep on basting, it thickens just like the picture.

Pretty good tasting and easy recipe. I used freshly cut pineapple chunks because I didn’t have canned; added a few dashes of apple cider vinegar and used fresh grated ginger root to deepen the tangy-ness and flavour!  Also, baked covered in foil, at 300 degrees for the first hour. Then cranked oven up to 375 for the last 30 minutes, uncovered. Everyone loved these tender tasty ribs!!

The whole family loved these.  The only change I had to make was to use an apricot-based xmas jam as I didn't have plain apricot.  That one had cloves in it which worked really well.   I am now using the same base to bake some chicken thighs as another reviewer suggested.  Two meals from one!

What an easy recipe to make. I cooked it for the 1 1/2 hours and then added 10 minutes to make up for any lost cooking time with the 15 minute basting intervals. 

The ribs were delicious!!

The ribs were nice and tender, however the sticky sauce was a little burnt after the one an half hours cook time.

These ribs turned out wonderful, served them with a side of Hawaiian fried rice, husband loved it!
I would recommend putting tinfoil in the pan first as it will help with cleanup.

I made it exactly to the recipe,Watching carefully as the sauce was blackening ,more than I like.Personally,it was bland and none of the spice ,jam or soy seemed to stand out enough for my taste any suggestions to liven it a bit? Thank you for the recipe,I think I will probably make it again and play with it a bit,maybe more garlic and ginger( I use the real stuff).Definitely cover baking pan with disposable foil..thanks againMimi
