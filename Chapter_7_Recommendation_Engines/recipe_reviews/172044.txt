This combination of ingredients came to their best fruition when eaten together. I took this to a dinner party and it easily fed 30 people who went back for extras. I received endless compliments. I stuck to the recipe except that I doubled the amount of romaine (which substantially increased the volume), added some carrot shreds, and made my own balsalmic dressing. To the vinegar I added cumin, fresh ginger, and seasoning salt, and whisked these all with olive oil. After tossing, I garnished the salad with edible flowers. The presentation was impressive and would have been as awe-inspiring minus the flowers, simply because of the beautiful array of fruit colors. I cannot wait to make this salad again when I have the crowd to serve it to or the special occasion on which to share this delicious salad.

Actually I want to give 4.5 stars. It doesn't get the final 1/2 star as I like a bit more bite of chilliness in a salad like this. So this is MY personal taste opinion. This is very good and is the second most popular salady item on the menu in our Caf√©

I took it to a football tailgaiting party and it was a hit.  I used goat cheese and it was delicious.

ohh this was so good! I had to skip the blue cheese and pistachios since I didn't have any but I can only imagine how much more awesome this would be with them. I made my own dressing with balsamic vinegar, olive oil and a little honey, plus sprinkled the whole salad with lemon juice, salt and pepper. I used fresh field greens and arugula instead of romaine for extra nutritional punch. this is a definite keeper!

Oh my goodness, this salad is amazing.  I am not partial to blue cheese so I used feta and I used tangerines instead of oranges.  I also didn't use the lettuce or dressing because I wanted a more decorative side salad.  This salad is simply bursting with flavors. I sprinkled a little stevia over the grapefruits to take the edge off as well.  I could see making this salad with fish or chicken or even for a brunch with eggs and salmon.  Awesome!

This is an awesome recipe! I have yet to try it with Pistachio's though. I'm not really a fan of nuts in my salads :( I do use feta in place of the blue cheese, as I am the only one that likes blue in our house. This makes for a wonderful springtime or summer salad with all of the wonderful colors. I love this with a nice spring mix or with a romaine/spinach mixture. My favorite dressing to serve with this is Citrus Vinaigrette by Maple Grove Farms.

Loved it. I'm not a blue cheese fan, so I left that out, other than that I made it exactly.
