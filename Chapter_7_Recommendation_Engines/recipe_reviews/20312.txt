I have always enjoyed Palak Panner however a word on Paneer -
Paneer is simple enough tom ake. to a couple of pints of fill cream milk, add the juice of one lemon and heat slowly. The resultant curds can then be lifted and squeezed/pressed to form a cheese. This is in fact the Indian home method of making the paneer.

This isn't perfect.  If you're looking for restaurant-quality palak paneer, this is not what you want.  It's edible, so I'm giving it three stars.  I probably won't make this again, but stick to a restaurant.  I used yoghurt instead of sour cream, and I tweaked the spices, but it still just didn't get there.  It needs cream and ghee, and I plan to find a recipe that's more authentic.  If you do make this, make sure to use paneer... it's easy to make on your own with some whole milk .  On the whole, a disappointment.

This recipe is amazing.  I did use a bit more of the spices than called for but I usually do!  I used some tomato paste instead of a whole tomato and I used chopped frozen spinach instead of fresh.  Since the spinach was already chopped I didn't process this in a blender.  I had to use Ricotta instead of Paneer but it wasn't difficult to cook. You put it in a skillet on a very low heat, leave it alone until it browns on the bottom and has cooked out a lot of the liquid.  The liquid will dissipate faster if you score the cheese in lines so there is a place for the liquid to bubble up through.  Once it is browned on the bottom cut between the scores and carefully flip over.  It will brown more quickly on the second side.  Remove from heat and let it cool completely then cut into cubes.  I use a good quality non-stick skillet without using any oil.  It worked out well.  This recipe is so good.  It is going to be one of my staples.  Thank you for submitting this!

A staple at our house. I use two 10oz boxes of frozen spinach, 1 cup of plain yogurt instead of the sour cream, leave out the tomato, and practically double the spices (or however much until it tastes spicy enough for me). Sometimes I fry some store-bought frozen paneer, but if I'm short on time I'll just make it without cheese. This dish is well complimented by the butter chickpea curry dish also found on this site.

I had some problems with this recipe.  When spinach cooks, it gives off water, so the mixture turned out really watery.  I needed to cook the mixture down because of the wateriness, but this decreased the potency of the spices, so I had to add more.  Next time, I will either use frozen spinach or precook and drain the spinach.  The final product turned out delicious, though, and better the next day.

One of the best vegetarian dishes in my recipe box.  I adjusted mine to a lower fat version.  First, cook onions in broth/water instead of oil; then I used fat-free sour cream (or fat-free yogurt and buttermilk if you choose); I also skipped the frying of the ricotta and just added skim ricotta to the final product and cooked for a few minutes before serving.  Perfect!  Thanks to the submitter for a delicious recipe!

This recipe is "complicated" compared to the average recipe (at least in my recipes!) - I would STRONGLY recommend less Turmeric, more tomato, and some desparately needed salt.  Also - buying store ready made paneer is DEFINITELY in your best interest.  My attempts at "frying" ricotta were haulted when the ricotta simply melted and separated. Maybe I did it wrong, but let me tell you - it was not even close to being browned and able to be cubed like what you can get at the store.

Although this turned out really good with some tweaking, as written, I'm only giving it 3 stars. Why anybody would want to make palak paneer without paneer is beyond me. I also thought it needed a lot more garlic and cumin, and I used 3 medium tomatoes.

Thank you!Thank you!Thank You!I've been looking for a good recipe for Palak Paneer. THis one was yummy.I heeded the advice of those who went before and used plenty of salt and also coarse chopped the spinach before cooking and skipped the processing. I didn't have any ricotta or tomato in the house and was dying to try it so I substituted extra firm silken tofu and just skipped the tomato. It was still delicious!

I didn't have paneer or ricotta cheese available so I left it out of the recipe.  However, I did serve it with toasted pita bread stuffed with flavorerd cheese spread.  It was absolutely fabulous.  My Indian husband thinks it's as good as any he's ever had.

I don't understand the substitution of ricotta for paneer when the cheese is so very simple to make. You also want to "bloom" the herbs/spices first (before adding spinach) by sauteing in pot with onions and garlic and then adding tiny amounts of liquid, cream or oil, then sauteeing again for five minutes. Repeat this process, known in Indian cookery as "blooming" three or four times.

This was truly excellent.  I'm so glad I found such a great palak paneer recipe!  Thanks!!

My modifications:

2 boxes of frozen high-quality brand spinach instead of fresh
1 cup lite sour cream
1/2 cup whole milk
1 can diced tomatoes including juices
double the amt of coriander and cumin but original amount of tumeric (it's strong and can be bitter)
3/4lb of homemade paneer, fried in olive oil 

Everything else was identical to the recipe and the procedure was followed exactly.

YUM!

Very very good. I left out the ginger root used yoghurt instead of sour cream and added a bit of fresh squeezed lemon juice. I used frozen spinach and worked just fine. I have never seen ricotta that could be cut in chunks so I had no idea what cheese to use so I used some spanish cheese, had the texture of mozzerela sticks, but hey, it held its shape tasted great, melted in your mouth and the kids loved it.

This Palak Paneer does not have enough spices to properly flavor the amount of spinach this recipe calls for. I thought it was bland and had little flavor.

this recipe was delicious!  I took the advice of everyone below and changed a few things. 1st, I used paneer rather than ricotta. it's palak PANEER after all!!!  I found it in our Foods for Living, but it looks like it may be easy to make. 2nd, I doubled all of the spices. It wouldn't have been nearly as delicious without doing that. 3rd, I used yogurt rather than sour cream-  costs less, and still adds great flavor.   This recipe does take a lot of work. It helped me to prepare all of the non-dairy items the day before, and then refrigerate overnight (greatly enhances flavor, too!), and then the next day added in the yogurt and fried cheese.   Also, fry up the spices in the olive oil so that they "pop," this will enhance their flavor!!  Enjoy :)

Excellent!!! Instead of fresh spinach, I used one package of frozen chopped spinach and found it to be the perfect amount (I know some other reviewers used 2 blocks). I also used paneer, as I have an Indian grocery right across the street from my house. I doubled the spices as other reviewers have suggested, and also through in a dash of tabasco at the end, which gives a nice spicey, slightly acidic edge to the overall creaminess. I strongly recommend that you puree the spinach mixture - I hadn't planned on it, but at the end I decided to and it was a good choice. I will definitely make this again!

Used swiss chard instead of spinach (couldn't tell the difference). I also used about 2 pounds of it, and I could have used the full 3 if I had it. I also used paneer since I found it, and just threw it in without frying as I don't think it needs it. Next time I would substitute yogurt for the sour cream and see how it turns out.

This was a pretty good recipe.  Like other people have suggested, I used a lot more spices than the recipe calls for.  I used 5 cloves of garlic (my boyfriend and I love garlic), 1 tablespoon of crushed red pepper in place of the dried red chili peppers, a cup of onion, 1 tablespoon of cumin, and 2 teaspoons of ground coriander.  Also, we used frozen spinach and squeezed all of the water out of it, which made the dish more like a spread.  We spread the dish on toasted pita bread and YUMMY!  When I make this again, I will use 1 to 1 and a half cups of yogurt in place of sour cream and perhaps 3 tomatoes.  Overall, a great dish that can be tweeked any way that you want!

Great results! I made this for my husband & sister-in-law who both love spinach to go along with the coconut chicken curry I was serving. The Palak Paneer received rave reviews from the eaters! Like previous reviewers suggested, I used 2 packages of frozen spinach (thawed & drained), queso fresco rather than ricotta & increased the amount of spices.

This was good, but not amazing. I was able to locate a local Indian grocery store so I had some Paneer with which to work and I liked that. Next time I'll ease up on the leamon and add a little more salt. The tomatoes are a nice pretty touch.

Good as a basic starter.  I changed it ...a bit.  I added 3 fresh bay leaves, doubled all the spiced and tripled the red peppers, 1/2 whole 1/2 crushed. I also added 2 tbs of garam masala and 2-3 Tbs of pickled ginger.  I used frozen spinach and this cut down the water content.  DO NOT BLEND, it will wreck the texture, simply begin with chopped frozen spinach...2 16oz bags.  I used queso fresco NOT ricotta.  Just cube and deep fry it till brown first.  With these changes it was awesome all the kids loved it too.  Well one of the six didn't try...lol  Just like the restraunts... I know my Paneers. Oh, and mine took more sour cream because their was not a lot of liquid. Good balance.  Served with Rice and a sweet raisan nut couscous.

I didn't care for this version of palak paneer. This tastes nothing like the yummy dish you'd find in an Indian restaruant.  And, don't take my word for it.  My husband, who is from India agrees. He says this tastse nothing like Indian Palak Paneer

If you want it to tasate like your fave Indian restuarant, you will need to use ~50% fenugreek leaves (aka Methi) in place of some of the spinach.  Also, replace the ricotta and sour cream with a thick plain yogurt.

I have to go with 4 stars (could have been 3 even) just b/c this recipe as written doesn't have near the spice and flavor one would except from Indian food.  Unfortunately, I had forgotten all the advice from others about doubling the spice (I was making tons of stuff last night and had reviewed so many recipes my head was spinning).  That said...this one has potential to be a 5 with doubling spices and adding 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper. FYI...I used 3 nine ounce bags of fresh spinach, 3/4 can of six ounce tomato paste, only used 3 TBS of olive oil in the initial step, bloomed the spices before adding the sour cream, and made my own paneer.  I also drained the spinach before putting in the food processor as it would have been way too runny with all the liquid that was still in the pan after cooking the spinach.   9-9-09 update:  I doubled the spices...did not care for it.

I would probably say that this recipe is far from perfect.  I had to increase the spice load big time just to get any decent flavor.  I also added some garam masala, as others had suggested.

Frying ricotta is not that difficult - just takes a little time.  You feel like you are making really watery scrambled eggs.  You have to let it fry long enough that most of the water evaporates.  I used part skim and it came out ok, though definitely not with the same consistency as paneer.  I was in a hurry, so I didn't make paneer but I certainly will sometime.

This recipe is a good place to start, and this comes from someone who has never made this dish before.  However I have eaten plenty of it, so I don't recommend anyone using this recipe unless they know what palak paneer is supposed to taste like. Just following the recipe as is makes for a very, VERY bland "palak ricotta".

I must say that this is very good with a few changes: doubled the spices, onion and garlic; added garam masala and red chili pepper; and added a medium tomato. So easy and turned out great!

This was delicious!  It doesn't taste exactly like what I'm used to in our local Indian restaurant, but it's so good we don't mind.  We did use a few substitutions based on what we had on hand: minced candied ginger in place of fresh, skipped the hot peppers & tomatoes & cilantro, and 1/2 c. plain yogurt in place of the sour cream.  We also skipped the blender step since my kids won't eat their veggies if they don't look like veggies! We loved the ricotta made into the paneer, but it took longer than we expected to get it the the right consistancy: about 15 minutes. Thanks for the yummy recipe.

This is a great recipe--so easy and tastey!  I had a little trouble frying the ricotta--not sure how to remedy that.  I added cauliflower to make it more substantial (left whole, not pureed) and the flavors went well together.  This will definitely be part of our regular rotation.

Fantastic!  The most authentic tasting palak paneer I have made.  Like other reviewers sugessted I doubled up on the spices.  I also fried the onions etc in cooking spray rather than oil or butter, and I used fat-free yogourt.

This was great! I do have to agree with the others - WAY too much spinach, but I adjusted the spices and sour cream to match the amount of spinach used. This amount made about 10 servings. Also had problems frying the ricotta - will use paneer next time, but this was the best Palak dish that I've made, and will use it for years to come!

Good recipe. I did change it a little. I used chopped frozen spinach and did not puree it but just cooked it chopped. Also, the previous night I baked ricotta cheese in a greased loaf pan at 350 F for 45-60 min, cooled and refrigerated it overnight. Then I cut it in cubes and used it the following day as a paneer substitue. It turned out pretty well although I had to be very careful not to allow it to crumble away.

i think it would be better to make a visit to a indian store and buy readmade paneer . It comes neatly cut in square shapes , and is pre-fryed . so there is no headache with all the work involved with the ricotta cheese

Wonderful!  Easy to make, I made mine with paneer, and brushed pita bread with olive oil and garlic powder to substitute for naan.  My sweetheart, who is not a fan of indian food or spinach was very happy with this!

My husband said this was good, so i'll give it a reluctant 3 stars, but I really didn't care for it. VERY bland...I've never made palak paneer before, and was excited to find a simple version of it, but I'll put in the time for the real thing next time. Not enough flavor, and the flavor and texture of the ricotta were just not right.

I adapted this recipe's instructions to suit my cooking style. I also used fresh cheese called queso fresco. This dish paired nicely with tandoori chicken, vegetable rice and veggie curry. The entire family craves it!!

I was a bit disappointed with the lack of flavor at first but then modified the heck out of it. I now do 2.5 bunches of spinach instead of 3, twice as much seasoning as the recipe called for, one or two more peppers, one more tomato, three times as much garlic and extra salt. Whew! Then it was extremely delicious.

This was a great basic recipe for Palak Paneer. I did use a lot more of the spices than what the recipe called for otherwise it would have been quite bland. Used a cup of low fat yogurt instead of sour cream. Added season salt, pepper and chili powder. I didnt have fresh ginger so substituted garlic ginger paste, didn't have tomatoes so substituted tomato paste. Added potatoes to make it a bit more interesting. Used store bought paneer which made it simple. Turned out great!

This recipe is a good starting point for making Palak paneer, but personal modificatations should be made to accomodate personal taste preferences.  I used the recipe, as it was my first time making palak paneer, but having eaten it several times before, both homemade and at restaurants, I had a good idea of what it should taste like if made properley.  Also, note that if you have a food processor, this recipe would work better. I don't and I used a blender, so it took me a while to get the consistency of the palak 'sauce' just right. 

Substitutions used- frozen spinach (very well drained to avoid excess water), chili poweder in place of dried red chiii, paneer in place of ricotta.

Modification suggestions - salt, add'l cumin, tumeric, and corriender

This was good and easy, and the fresh spinach is a must! I wasn't thrilled with the outcome of the ricotta cheese. I may have done something wrong, but it just made a muddy mess in my pan. Maybe my pan wasn't hot enough. 

Next time, I'll try hanging the ricotta cheese in cheese cloth first to get it more solid.

Tasty.  I doubled the spices and used fat free yogurt instead of sour cream, adding a bit more than the recipe called for to make it creamier.  I highly recommend baking the ricotta in a loaf pan before frying, like one of the previous posters suggested.

A satisfying recipe.  I only used 1 pound of baby spinach (no chopping required!) and the spiciness seemed just right to me.  I used one of the optional red chili peppers.  The only problem was frying the paneer (I bought it cheaply at Food Basics in Ontario), which I have never been able to do without it falling apart and sticking to the pan in crusty little bits.  I wonder if deep frying would work better but, as I don't need all that fat, I'll probably just throw it in without frying it.

I probably would have given this dish 4 stars for tastiness if I didn't have any expectations regarding how palak paneer is supposed to taste.  But alas, I did, and it didn't taste like the palak paneer I've had at Indian restaurants.  I think more sour cream and more spices.  I'll have to play with it some more.

Very easy to make. I had to do without the
paneer but extra-firm tofu works well as
a substitute. I miss Indian food (I used
to work in NYC and there were lots of great
Indian restaurants there.) 
This recipe reminded me of something I'd
get in those restaurants. Thank you!

This IS very good over basmati rice! It was also fun to cook! I've always wanted to make something that smelled like what my Indian neighbors used to cook. This was it!

It's even better after the spices have a chance to mix after a few days. Once it's fixed you have enough to use for a while. It's kind of like a spinach gravy for rice. Mmmmmmmmmmmm

Good palak paneer, but I did not find the spice mix as recommended to be right on.  I wouldn't recommend this as a main dish, but it makes a solid side dish to anything spicy -- Indian food or not.  Don't over process the cooked spinich or you'll end up with palak mush.

Pretty good. I didn't have coriander, but added gram masala and 1/4 tsp of red pepper. My mixture was dry so added some vegtable broth. Also, I used fat free yogurt & it kinda curdled! So next time it will be the last thing I add. The whole ricotta for paneer deal is weird. Tasted okay, but too much work for the outcome. Just buy paneer.

Very good!  My wife hates Indian food and she liked it!  I didn't have any sour cream (forgot to buy it) so I substituted lowfat yogurt and it still came out great.  If this is the first time you make it, it will seem like you have way way too much spinach, but as it cooks down it ends up perfect.

This is decent! I used butter instead of olive oil. I had to add a lot more spices including cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, etc. It was bland without.

Excellent recipe.  The one modification I made was to skip the ricotta and use drained extra firm tofu.  It was easy and makes the recipe acceptable for vegans and the lactose intolerant.

I used 1 lb frozen chopped spinach, and the ratio to spice was perfect.  I used a full cup of the sour cream.  I didn't blend or process the spinach, consequently I cooked it a little differently, adding the spinach before the sour cream and cooking it until it was very tender adding a bit of water now and then.  Used 1/2 small can tomatoes instead of fresh. Made the paneer using 1/2 gallon milk and 2 cups buttermilk.  It was absolutely delicious, set up beautifully, was easily able to dice and fry it.  I tried it again, this time spicing the paneer with salt and granulated garlic.  It did not set up as well, and for the minute flavor difference, I'll stick to the original from now on.  I highly recommend this delicious recipe.  Make it without the paneer if you are in a hurry, it's still fabulous!  Thank you!

This is a great recipe. I did not have ingredients to make paneer so I did use ricotta cheese. WARNING! You MUST use a full fatted Ricotta or it will not hole up to frying. I used full fatted ricotta and it was PERFECT! Did not brown as well but still made perfect cubes!Thanks for the idea. Paneer is till much better if you have time to make it or can buy it readily....YUMMY!

Great recipe!  I use tons of recipes from All Recipes.com.  This Palak Paneer recipe is definitely a new favourite!

I followed the recipe, as well as some of the reviewer suggestions, and loved it!  I used chopped spinach and ready-made paneer.  I did have to add more spice to get it to our liking, but, not a big deal.

Overall, just super!!

I've made this recipe more times than I can count and it's turned out perfect every time. I've always used paneer instead of ricotta and sometimes I will use tomato paste instead of fresh if I don't have it. I usually use frozen chooped spinach as well. Perfect with Naan.

I wasn't so sure about this recipe...  sour cream? ricotta cheese?  they don't even have these things in india!  but i tried it anyway.  i skipped the ricotta.  i made my own paneer the day before (it is really easy - i got the recipe from this site).  my first mistake was that i used fat free sour cream so it wasn't creamy enough.  next time i will use regular.  and the biggest mistake of all - i didn't double the spices.  Definitely, definitely, definitely double the spices.  I didn't do it because i wanted to try the recipe without significant changes the first time.  needs more spices.  it wasn't so good the first night (way too spinachy) but the leftovers a couple of days later were much better.  i had a tough audience.  my fiance is from india so it is hard to measure up to his standards when it comes to cooking indian food, but we both agreed that this had potential.  i am also wondering how it would be with yogurt rather than sour cream.  thanks for the recipe!

This is a good starting point for palak paneer.  I changed the balance of the spices to suit myself.  Also, if I make it for people that enjoy the spicing of Indian food, I add chilli powder and garam masala.  Regardless, I always add some nutmeg or mace to the base recipe.
Also, I think that the tomatoes should be  well fried in the oil after the onions, etc

I used frozen spinach and more than doubled the spices. Very pleased with the result. Next time I'll think I'll make it vegan and use tofu instead of the cheese.

This recipe had been in my recipe box for ages before I finally found some paneer in an organic shop nearby. Definitely worth waiting for, even if I had to add more spices. I think it would have been a bit bland as is.

I made this dish for my first dinner party ever - I added a bit of whole milk at the end because it was too dry, used frozen spinach since its immensely quicker and just as good, and nearly doubled all the spices.  I bought pre-fried paneer from an Indian Grocery.  My friends said it was delicious, and I actually ran out of food!

I am afraid I found this to be quite bland, although my husband loved it.  I do like bold tasting dishes.  I pretty much followed the recipe, used Paneer rather than the ricotta cheese and used Yogurt for the sour cream.  Kept adding spices, even curry and Gram Masala, but still quite bland for my taste.  Will make again though and see what happens.

Recipe turned out great (though I feared it might be too bland before a healthy dose of salt at the end). I used 1 1/2 lbs frozen chopped spinach (3 lbs seems like *way* too much), which I just added to the saucepan frozen instead of cooking it first. I also used Trader Joe's paneer instead of ricotta. Besides adding a few more cloves garlic and using a full medium onion, I stuck to the recipe. I wasn't very confident about it initially, but I was wrong -- this one's a keeper!

I really like these creamy spinach-based dishes at Indian restaurants.  But I was disappointed by how this turned out; it wasn't smooth and creamy enough.  This may partially be because I skipped the pureeing (because others said it was unnecessary and I don't have a food processor).  But still I used half the spinach and kept adding more sour cream in an attempt to make creamy (probably ended up doubling it) but it still wasn't what I hoped.  Not bad in the least, just not what I expected/wanted. 
Update: I tried this recipe again around a year later because of all the
positive reviews were making me doubt my review and because I'd acquired a
food processor.  But I stand by my 3 star rating.  This time (sing 1 1/4
pounds of spinach), it ended up smooth (perhaps too much so), but still
wasn't creamy.  I tried adding more sour cream but that didn't help.  The
taste is still wrong.

I'll admit, I don't know exactly what Palak Paneer is supposed to taste like. But this was good! I didn't have enough sour cream, or any paneer, so I used a block of soft tofu and blenderized it and it tasted great. I added extra spices and  agree with other reviewers that this is great with basmati rice (and a beer). MMMM!

This tasted really good to me.  I do not know how authentic palak paneer is supposed to taste, but I really enjoyed it over buttered basmati rice. I used actual paneer instead or ricotta for the recipe though, which may have made it better.

Awesome recipe for spinach!  Everyone loved it.  I used just 26-28 ounces of spinach, which was plenty.  Instead of a fresh tomato, I added one can of (drained) stewed tomatoes.  And for the final step, I elimated the 3 Tbsp. olive oil and simply returned the spinach puree to the pan and stirred in the ricotta, then heated until warm.  I used fat-free sour cream and fat-free ricotta, making this a very healthy side-dish.

Wow, this is awesome.  I made this with fresh spinach and served it with a chicken vindaloo, and my husband and I both loved it.  I didn't have success frying up chunks of ricotta, so I just stirred it into the mix unfried.  I'm going to make it again next week for a small dinner party-- it's that good!

The dish came out delicious. I served it as a side dish with fish curry and rice.
Everyone loved it. I used 2 bunches of fresh, washed, chopped spinach that needed to be cooked an extra 10 mins. The palak is actually supposed to be pureed in the original dish but I guess one can leave it chopped. Delicious even when pureed! Thanks for a great recipe.

I used pressed, marinated then baked extra firm  fresh!! tofu. Press tofu between cutting boards after wrapping bricks with paper towels then kitchen towels. I press for an hour at least with my iron skillet on top with a large can of tomatoes. Marinate with olive oil, curry powder, salt & pepper overnight in fridge as this mellows the tofu taste. Bake at 375 for 30 - 45 min turning every 15 min or so. Voila!

This is the WORST recipe I've ever tried in over 40 years of cooking.  I don't even know where to begin.  Maybe it started with the incorrect proportions, maybe with the fact that ricotta cheese doesn't really brown, maybe with the watery consistency of the spinach mixture, the fact that it tastes like nothing... I'm at a loss and nauseous to boot.  And I don't know what to do with the ten pounds of green liquid nothing I have leftover!  One star because spinach is (usually) good for you.

I've made this recipe twice before exactly as listed, but this time I did it with only 1 pound of fresh spinach, and we liked it SO much better!! The flavors balanced much better and tasted less like baby food. To make this vegan, I did tofu instead of cheese and coconut yogurt instead of cream.  I just added some tomato paste and quadrupled (or so) the spices (plus sriracha). Maybe it's not authentic, but it's DELISH!

Very good.  Lots of work so I would definitely use frozen spinach next time.  Also.. as others have said.. the ricotta was odd but I just blended it in at the end.  I used lots more garlic and spices

This just tasted horrible, and I love palak paneer. Any paneer, really. But, to be fair, I don't think I should have tried this recipe, as it calls for ricotta instead of paneer. Also, the oil for the cheese was way too heavy.

I simmered it for an extra 45 minutes at the end which I really think brought out more flavor and made it similar to the palak I've had in Indian restaurants.  To save calories, I left out the cheese and used non-fat sour cream.  I just ate it over jasmine rice and it was terrific.   It's great reheated, too.  Today I tossed in some small cubes of smoked mozzarella.  Delish.

Ricotta doesn't really "brown" in oil. I have never really liked the paneer I've had in restaurants, it's too dry and bland--I was sure it was tofu. So I'm not going to the trouble of making my own paneer.    Anyway, after I tried to brown the ricotta and it only melted, I added some feta chunks, which I had been planning to do. So I had a ricotta-feta mix, and I mixed it all in which suited me better than the dry chunks of paneer I've had.     Also, I didn't food-process this, I used frozen spinach, and I didn't cook it for as long as the recipe calls for. I'm not a baby and I don't plan to eat baby food until I lose at least 20 more teeth.    Another change for me--I used yogurt instead of sour cream. That seemed more authentically Indian.

I really enjoyed this paneer, but it didn't taste like it had when I had had it in the restaurants or in the frozen food section either. I will definitely take the suggestions of yogurt and frozen spinach next time.

Delicious. I added more sour cream. 1%, seasonings to taste. Oh and since we have a fantastic Indian grocery store in our neighbourhood I substituted ghee for olive oil. I wouldn't try to do this with ricotta, find a grocery store where you can buy paneer if possible.

I lost my old palek paneer recipe, so I gave this one a shot. I made this recipe exactly as written (with the exception of using paneer- something that I find to be key to a good palek paneer) and was disappointed.     Spices were faintly apparent- after tasting the lifeless result, I upped them with 2 tsp garam masala and 1/2 tsp turmeric. I also added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp cayenne. I added a cup of plain yogurt and some desperately needed salt. At that point the recipe was acceptable.

Maybe it's just differences in how this dish is prepared but I expected this dish to be creamier than it was.  I used the two boxes of frozen spinach and 1 cup yogurt and doubled the spices as recommended by one of the users but I found the dish tastes just like spinach and not much else.

This was not spicy enough for us... maybe my chilies weren't big enough since they were quite small. Also, too much liquid. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with the recipe though, it was probably my lack of experience in cooking this sort of food. Next time I will add more spices, less sour cream, drain the spinach better, and cut the paneer into smaller chunks. But I WILL try this again :) BTW, very labor intensive so be wary, an extra pair of helping hands in the kitchen would be advised!

I was a little disappointed with how this recipe turned out. It tasted very strongly of cumin- the tomato, ginger and cilantro flavors were completely covered up. I used 1 lb frozen chopped spinach instead of the fresh and subbed a pound of firm tofu instead of the cheese. This made enough to serve at least 8 people, looks like we'll be eating it for a while! I do want to try this recipe again sometime, tweaking some of the ingredients.

A great basic recipe and I will make this again. I prepared this dish for a party and it was well received.

I used frozen spinach and pureed the spinach and tomatoes before adding them to the pan instead of blending it later. I cooked the non-dairy ingredients and spices the day before and refrigerated the mix overnight. It could also be frozen at this stage.

The next day I heated up the spinach mixture, added a little cilantro, the sour cream, fried paneer (instead of ricotta) and more spices to taste. Since I got the prep out of the way the day before, it only took 10 minutes to finish the dish and serve.

My mom has been making this dish forever now...here are some important tips...make some cashewnut paste and add with the ginger and garlic for a creamier taste...skip tomatoes because this is primarily a green dish...also boil onions with the spinach for their tastes to evolve together.

i was very happy with this. uses a TON of spinach but its worth it to use fresh instead of frozen. looks horrendous until it makes it to the blender. DEFINITELY use paneer instead of ricotta. i added a little cayenne pepper instead of chiles. im a baby when it comes to heat so a little went a long way.

thanks very much!

I don't know what happened, but this just didn't work for me at all. Maybe I messed up or something. I'll try it again, but it was really bitter and didn't taste like the palak paneer/saag paneer I'm used to having at restaurants.

The only problem that I have with this dish is that it is NOT "Palak Paneer". It should be called "Palak Ricotta". It is good to try new things, but I would change the name, because it does not have Paneer in it.  You can either make your own Paneer, fairly easy, or just buy it out of a store.

I tried the above reciepe with 10 oz. fresh packged spinach, and home-made paneer, with slight modifications.  I presure cooked the spinach in advance and then grinded (I also grinded the tomato) it before putting it in the onion - sourcream gravy. and then I allowed the whole thing to cook for 10-15 minutes (I did this more for convinence reason).  The dish was much better than the spinach of some of the resturants we have tried around here in Michigan.  But my daughter still likes the taste of the frozen ready-made spinach paneer that  we get in the frozen section of the Indian store more.
I will try making this recipe again.

My first try at this was a disaster - I messed up a couple of times, and then their recipe just wasn't quite what I was looking for.  This recipe was great!  I used 4 10-oz. boxes of frozen spinach (thawed and drained).  Couldn't find paneer at the store (and my first attempt at making it had failed miserably) so I used Queso Blanco de Freir, which worked wonderfully.

This is a great way to use up spinach, and is a really, really good tasting dish! I don't quite understand how the ricotta is supposed to be fried -- mine just went more and more dry over the time in the pan, so eventually I gave up on that and now just add the blended spinach mixture to the "heated" ricotta. I did try once substituting yogurt for the sour cream, as some people suggested, but find that it really takes away from the creamy texture and the delicious flavour, so I won't do that again. Also, I sometimes add small, fried cubes of tofu to the ricotta before adding everything together again. The strength in this recipe is that it uses things I find in my fridge all the time, and it's a fantastic and yummy way to get iron and vitamin C! Good served with Carrot Rice (from this site). Thanks!

Wow-this was great.  I didn't have the paneer because I didn't have time to make it to an Indian grocer and I didn't want to spend time frying the ricotta.  I also just chopped everything up and skipped processing it.  I look forward to making this dish again and again-it is fabulous.

excellent palak paneer recipe, just like homemade in India! It takes a while to fry the ricotta (15+ minutes) so start that a little earlier in the process.

I made this without coriander, substituted plain yogurt in place of sour cream, and added a little bit of sugar to balance the sourness. I blended the thawed frozen spinach and then cooked it with the onion, and it was delicious! My boyfriend thanked me repeatedly for this. Highly recommended.

This is so yummy. May I suggest processing the uncooked spinach *before* adding it to the spice and onion mixture, it's easier, less mushy, and more authentic looking and tasting.  Also, the paneer is a must-have for the authentic taste.  My husband looooooves this dish! So do I!

Great Dish!  My husband and I love indian food, and palak paneer is our favorite when we go to resturants so I was thrilled to find this on this website.  Thank you for displaying it.  I used frozen spinach but I think next time fresh would make the dish much better. The ricotta chesse was interesting, if I can find paneer I am sure it would be much more authentic.

This stuff is really yummy!  I only used half the amount of fresh spinach and chopped it by hand.  The addition of extra salt really helped bring out the flavor of the spices.

This is a fair replica of the restaurant version, but needs more spicing and less processing just as others have said.  I'll definitely try it again, as it works beautifully with my favorite tandoori chicken (a no-effort version that requires only Patak's paste and yogurt but gets plenty of compliments).

This was oh so good!  Next time, I won't put it in the blender but just chopp it roughly while it's in the sauce pan cooking...no mush that way.  I served this with potato pea patties and yogurt salad. Ummmm!

Not bad but I found recipe didn't have enough flavor and I needed to play around a lot with the spices to get it right. Even then something was missing.  Frozen spinach worked just as well.

This is really delicious.  When I make it next time, I'll use frozen spinach - why spend the $ on fresh just to chop it up and cook it anyway?  Other than that, this is easy and extremely tasty.

Made this on the advice of the sweet glassy eyed and small dribble of drool hanging from his smiling lips coworker and friend. Having never eaten this I have nothing to judge it against. Being a newbie and having heard from above mentioned friend that even in India this is a “hard” dish to master at home, I pretty much read ALL the reviews. Then fellow Foodies, I went for it!!! This is REALLY  $&@#ing good!!! Only 4 stars as written. BUT! With the helpful suggestions of others on this sight and your own basic food loving instincts Oh Wow Yum!!! 10 stars. Doubled the spices if not quadrupled in my favorites and trusted my inner little Ratatouille chef. Yum Yum Yum. And YES! USE the paneer. Don’t be afraid. DO IT

Thumbs down. I followed the instructions, but my dish came out very watery, and thus the spices were watered down.

Soooo tasty. I definitely take it easy on the olive oil and sour cream. Tried not frying the paneer once, it was not the same. Of course, I get horrible oil splatter when I fry the cheese but such is the cost of tastiness. This recipe has become a go to for me. I usually eat it in two sittings.

Um.. I just didn't think it was absolutely perfect.  Maybe I was hoping for restaurant-style when I knew it wouldn't be, but this was just... I don't know... not recognizable as Palak Paneer?  It was good, I'd make it again, but I don't salivate thinking about it, as I do most Indian food.

This is the hardest Indian dish to get right, in my opinion. Maybe one just needs to have learned it from an Indian mother. I've tried at least a half dozen recipes for this (one from a highly regarded Indian cookbook author) and they were all big disappointments. This recipe was, too. With some ethnic dishes, I think you either have it in your DNA to make it taste right or you don't. If you love this dish when it's served in a fine Indian restaurant, have it there.

I made a couple of substitutions for what I had on hand.  I used the Paneer recipe by Amibould instead of ricotta, and I didn't have sour cream so I used regular cream.  This is soooooooooooo good!  Leftovers got yummier with age too.  Ate it over Naan by Mic.

This was definately NOT perfect palak paneer.  It wasn't even mediocre palk paneer.  It was missing all the key spices that make palak paneer wonderful, making it absolutely tasteless.  It was just a pile of steamed, pureed spinach.  I was very disappointed.

Fabulously good.  If you leave out the chile peppers, I recommend a generous dash of chile powder to give it a kick.  I also tend to prefer plain crumbled feta to the fried ricotta if you don't have paneer.

This was delicious! I doubled the spices and used the sour cream (one small individual size) but yoghurt might sub well. I used fresh cilantro and paneer (about 250g).  Yum!

I've been making this recipe for years now.  My husband, who used to hate spinach absolutely loves it.  I use 2 packages of frozen spinach (drained/squeezed of all water) and store bought paneer cubes.  I double up on the spices too.  I serve it with nan bread.  So good!

Not sure about the ricotta part; when I fried it, nothing really happened so by the time it was added it just was like adding curds to the dish. I'd recommend making some cheese cubes instead (there are recipes here for it).  I didn't buy 3 lbs of spinich as it called for, recommend you buy more than you think you'll need (I only used 1 bunch) as without that much spinich it turns into a veggie curry-like dish rather than that thick spinich dish you are looking for.

It's a good recipe.  It's not 5 star, but is definitely a good dish given the relatively low difficulty of assembling.

This is a great recipe.  It is better than anything at a restaurant.  Using fresh spinach instead of frozen really makes a difference.  You can find paneer in the fridge and freezer section of any Indian grocery.

My family and I were very disappointed in how this recipe turned out.  It was completely bland.  I think the main problem is that way too much spinach is called for--especially since it is supposed to be only four servings.  One pound of spinach would probably be a better amount to use, but I'm not sure that would solve the problem.

Delicious.  I doubled the sour cream since I love a very creamy recipe and it didn't overpower the flavor of the dish.  The ricotta cheese really will brown nicely - be patient!   This is a favorite restaurant dish of my family.  It's nice to be able to make it at home - the kids forget they're eating spinach!

I used low-fat everything and used the wrong kind of Ricotta (the kind you put in lasagna...oops!) and it was still a big hit.  My friends think I'm a more sophisticated cook than I really am because this came out so well!

Sooooo good.  I also made it with the curried chick peas, and it was a little tricky trying to juggle everything, but I wouldn't say it was too complicated otherwise.  I agree that trying to fry the ricotta was not a success.  I may consider draining some cottage cheese and browning that next time.  Other than that, I only used one bunch of fresh spinach (I think it was about a pound or two, tops) and I might kick up some of the spices a notch.  Definitely worth making again.  Yummy.

This was good! I have never had an "authentic" dish...so I have nothing to compare to. I used frozen chopped spinach and did not puree it. I also used yogurt instead of sour cream, and made my own paneer...which is very very easy and it fried very nicely. I will make it again definately!

Great recipe to base your tastes on. Personally, I would not blend for more than 15 seconds, 30 was way too much. I also used about a cup of sour cream, not sure if it may have been too much. I think this needed more hot peppers for sure, at least 4. Also, I would not blend the tomato, just chop and add after blending. I also added more cilantro because 4 sprigs is hardly noticible. Smells fantastic, but needs more to break it up so be sure to add more cilantro and add in some diced tomatoes after blending. I also used the Paneer cheese recipe from this site instead of ricotta. I can't imagine putting ricotta in indian food, be sure to get the real thing!

I am so proud of myself for actually making palak paneer!   I didn't have spinach so I used chard and mustard greens, and it still tasted GREAT! The recipe was so easy and fun.  I live a block away from the best Indian restaurant in the SF Bay area, and this dish was definitely on par.

I have made this a few times now, changing a few things each time. I have settled on using yogurt instead of sour cream, frozen spinach instead of fresh, and fried potatoes instead of fried ricotta. Excellent with chickpea curry found on this site and brown rice.

The curry was ok, but using ricotta instead on homemade paneer (which is very easy to make) seemed too far of a stretch.  It takes more work, but the texture is worth it.

I made this the other night and both my husband and I loved it!!! I didn't have 3 pounds of spinach though, so I used broccoli as well... Plus we used much more garlic and ginger than specified, just because we love spice. It was great, we served it with brown rice and curried chicken thighs.

I don't think the title is accurate, but for what I expected, this was good (albeit I changed it a bit). I enjoy Indian food, but don't typically cook it more than once every week, so I am no expert at knowing what the dish should taste like, but I enjoy similar dishes at restaurants and I would say that this was getting at the gist of it anyway, which is close enough for me considering how simple it was. I doubled the spices and onion and added an extra clove of garlic, and only used maybe 3/4 lb of spinach. (That was all I had, and that seemed to be plenty for me.) For simplicity sake, I pureed the onion, garlic, and ginger in a food processor beforehand (this makes a nice base I find for Indian food) and cooked that with all the spices in oil, then ran all the spinach through the food processor to dice it and then added that. I also used ricotta (since that's why I found this recipe - a way to use up some ricotta!), and I didn't find that it came down to a paneer-like texture, so was not chunky but rather was spread throughout the dish when I added it, but it tasted good. I would make this again, and would also use the sauce base with things besides cheese, like chicken, as it's a simple and good-tasting base.

Double the spices and cilantro except turmeric.
Used half the tomato.
Used two x 10oz cut frozen spinach --> cooked and drained.
Used vegan butter for extra moisture.
Did not add any of the dairy.
Slowly browned the onion with ginger, then added garlic till fragrant, then bloomed the spices before adding the spinach.
VEGAN and DELISH Palak! 
Thanks McFalone!

I had some spinach and tofu that needed to be used. Immediately I thought of making a paneer. My search on Allrecipes turned up this recipe. It calls for ricotta cheese, so I fried up some tofu in it’s place. Other than that, I pretty much followed the recipe. This was my first attempt at a paneer and I was pretty pleased with the results. I’ll be filing this recipe away to use again.

This recipe as is would probably be only 3 stars. I used paneer instead of ricotta, closer to 2lb of spinach, and plain yogurt instead of sour cream. As some other commenters suggested, I cooked the spinach beforehand to avoid a watery mess. I also used heaping teaspoons of each spice, but I think as shown, this would be kind of bland. It's pretty good with some naan, but I would use more ginger and garlic next time.

Absolutely perfect is a good name.  I actually had paneer and was looking for a recipe to use it in.  Other modifications are that I used frozen spinach, yogurt instead of sour cream, a little bit of garam masala, and no tomato.  It was delicious.  This is good over quinoa (like rice), but I thought the combination of ingredients was so delicious that the spinach by itself--even without the cheese--was addictive.  I will make this again.  It is healthy and filling.

Delicious and easy to make, also very filling for a vegetarian recipe (that does not involve potatoes)

i don't know where i went wrong.  i think i'll blame it on being overly ambitious when i made it (i also attempted to make dahl and naan at the same time).  i must say that it called for way too much spinach, though.  next time i want saag i'll go to my favorite indian restaurant up the street.

It tasted good, though this was not like palak paneer that I am accustomed to. Not sure if I will make again.

The ricotta is too much of a difference to be good, but the palak was good.  Use the other paneer recipe on this site to much better results.

I thought this was really good. I recommend using paneer instead of ricotta and we used about 1 and 1/2 cups whole milk yogurt instead of the sour cream.  This made at least six servings though so we could have cut everything in half and still had plenty to eat.  Also if you use frozen spinach, you will probably need to add water; we added close to a cup to get the consistency we wanted.  Next time, I think we will process the spinach in a blender instead of a food processor to get a smoother texture like that found in restaurants.

Excellent meal.  I bought paneer, making my life easier.  I dont have a food processor so I just chopped it all and modified where necessary, it still great.
