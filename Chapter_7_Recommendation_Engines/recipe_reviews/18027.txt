My dog loves em. This one was recommended to me by a friend, and she suggested omitting the cheese and bouillon and adding 1 cup peanut butter. Makes for a better dough too. :)

NOTE: SHORT SHELF LIFE.  Unlike the biscuits you buy from the store which are good indefinitely, these are more like people cookies.  I made a full batch for my little dog and had to throw most of it away after a few weeks because it turned hard and mildewed.  Cut the portions down, or else freeze some of the dough or biscuits.

I have used this recipe twice for fund raisers.  The treats sold like hotcakes with the proceeds going to The United Way both times.  The feedback I got from dog owners was STUPENDOUS!  DOGS LOVE THESE TREATS!!!  One lady told me she was given a few of these by a co-worker and took them home in her purse.  When she got home, her dog literally dragged her purse across the floor trying to get to them.  I substitute Jiffy cornbread mix for the cornmeal (& eliminate the sugar).  I also have used chicken bouillon.  To cut down on work for me, I always buy the large bags of sharp shredded cheese (Kraft). This is a little more cheese than the recipe calls for, but works great.  This makes a large batch, so just divide appropriately and freeze the rest for later.  Bow Wow!

I make these cookies every other week. Here are some things to consider: Cornmeal is NOT good for dogs. I omit it, and add some extra oats and whole wheat flour instead. Also, instead of white sugar I prefer to use honey. Other than that it's a great recipe, just play around with it. Most importantly: If you don't have the time to roll out the dough and use cookie cutters, shape it into 2 logs, roll 'em up in waxpaper, and put 'em in the freezer for a couple of hours. Cut the log into 1/2 inch slices, place the slices on a cookie sheet, and bake them as directed. Saves a lot of time, and it's a 'no mess, no fuss' solution. Just a thought...Thanks for reading.

Seemed to work out pretty well, but my vet told me that cornmeal isn't good for dogs, so I'm not sure if I'll make it again.

I made many changes to this but it's a winner for sure!  I subbed the cornmeal as corn is not good for most dogs and put nutritional yeast in it's place as it tastes cheesy but is loaded with B vitamins to repel mosquitoes and fleas, I subbed the cheddar for Mozzarella (lower in fat), I added a second egg to make them softer, eliminated the sugar, subbed margarine for olive oil (no trans fats) and lowered the cheese as I was using the yeast so it only needed 3/4 cup cheese.  I tested these on all the dogs today at our fund raiser for 4-H dog project and got 100% approval - over 20 dogs (even very "finiky" ones that are "not food motivated") loved these treats!  With the changes, they are LOADED with healthy fats and nutrients.  I also used Omega 3 eggs (as I feed my chickens flax so they pass on the good fats in the eggs).  Even with all the subs - it was an excellent recipe.  Next time I'll try it with rice flour for gluten intolerant dogs.  Thanks for this one - I'll bake it for our fundraisers.

We made these and gave them to all our friends with dogs, everyone LOVED them!  Did omit the milk and added 1/3 cup peanut butter and 1/2 cup chicken broth, makes a GREAT easy to work with dough.  Stored in the refrigerator, and they are a GREAT inexpensive dog treat to make!

This was a very easy recipie to work with! The dough was great and not sticky at all!!! But caution, check cookies every 10 minutes. Certain different pans might cook quicker! You can find all sorts of cookie cutters (including bone shape) at Michaels Craft Store! I bake a few dozen for all my doggie clients every Christmas! (I'm a groomer!)

Winner!  Our Samoyed, Herbert, loves these.  We have done the side by side test with these against Breathbusters, pig ears, Snausages, roast beef with gravy, and pepperoni sticks and he chooses these treats every time!  I use a little less flour (maybe 2 and a half cups) and just cut in squares rather than bothering with cookie cutters.  Be careful though because some dogs have sensitivities to corn meal!!

My dog loved these cookies.   The dough was easy to work with.  They do not spread out in the oven - so I put as many as I could on one cookie sheet.  Very easy to make!

The dough was a little tough to knead, so I added some peanut butter which helped it all stick together and the dogs certainly didn't seem to mind the extra ingredient! One of our dogs will eat anything, but the other one is picky and they both loved these treats and begged for more.

This recipe is a real keeper.  At first I wasn't sure I was going to get that 3rd cup of flour worked in but it worked out very well.  A very nice cookie dough to work with.  Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe.  I have 4 dogs, 2 labs, 2 schnauzers, and they all love these cookies.

First of all, let me say that I tweaked this so much that it's only  fair to give at least 5 stars:  I did cut out the sugar and the cornmeal.  I added a couple teaspoons of honey and about a cup of peanut butter.  Then I opened the refrigerator and decided to add some cooked rice and a few shredded baby carrots.  This invention was not the easiest to roll it out and cut, so I just dropped little teaspoonfuls onto the cookie sheets and flattened them a little.  I wasn't sure how long to bake this concoction: some baked for 15 minutues and were pretty soft; by the end of this adventure, I was leaving them in for about 30 minutes.  And I know all of you are wondering: they tasted pretty awful to me (yes, I did!), but in the eyes of our 3 furry fellows, I am now a culinary goddess. So, I guess the bottom line is: you really can't mess up this recipe and the recipients will love you forever! And isn't that why we would do this in the first place  ;-)

All the dogs at the shelter loved these! The only thing I did different was to add chicken bouillon instead of beef because thats all I had. If you have the time to make your dogs these treats please think about sharing it with the dogs at the shelters. They need a little love too. Thank You.

My 4 yr old Boston Terrier loves these cookies! I made them for the first time yesterday with some changes of course. First I halved the recipe then I used plain cream of wheat in place of the cornmeal. And I used 1/4 cup of chicken stock in place of the milk and 1/3 cup peanut butter in place of the sugar. The dough was easy to work with. My dog went crazy as soon as the over timer went off. He couldn't understand that they had to cool first, once they did he would do anything to get as many of these as he could. I used a 2" bone and squirrel cookie cutter. Can't wait to make these again!

Corn (maize) is one of the most common food allergies in dogs.  If you have a working breed or very active dog especially, I would find an alternative to the cornmeal.  Look for things such as skin irritation, flakes, dry skin etc in your dog.  I tried it with flaxmeal and it turned out well.  Much better for my dogs as flax seed oil is something I use to supplement my dog's diet.  Regardless, they loved the flaxmeal version :)

GREAT recipe! My chihuahuas went insane for these!! I made a few changes... Used shredded carrots instead of cheese (my dogs love carrots), apple sauce instead of margarine, and peanut butter instead of bullion (didn't have any low sodium). I then halved the recipe and used a play cookie cutter from a kids baking set (smallest cutter I could find) and got about 50 cookies. Am about to make another batch right now!

I've been making these dog treats for about 12 years and even with all the variations I've tried have never failed to please. My favorite variation is to add leftover bacon grease, beef bouillon powder, and cheese (sometimes I'll cut up Velveeta if I don't have shredded cheddar). This makes the biscuits taste like bacon cheeseburgers. My kids and husband eat them too. After baking, the biscuit is somewhat soft - not hard and crunchy like Milkbones - and will mold after a few days so I usually keep them in the refrigerator.

Edit - For those that don't want to use cornmeal, try ground flaxseed meal instead of cornmeal. I've done it that way many times and my dogs love them.

I made these with my 11-year-old daughter, which was a lot of fun. My dogs loved these! Instead of the cornmeal, which some dogs can be sensitive to, I substituted in the same amount of oats. I left out the sugar, beef bouillon and cheese and used 1 cup of peanut butter and replaces the margarine with 1/3 cup of fresh bacon grease. After cooking them I let them set in the oven over night to harden. My dogs couldn't get enough of these! I will definitely make them again.

My dog Moose loved these cookies as well as my friends who I gave them to.  I made these changes to the original recipe: I used olive oil in place of margarine, wheat germ in place of cornmeal, no sugar or bouillon.  Even my friends cat loved them!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  I feel better giving these treats to my dog since there are no preservatives or artificial flavorings in them.

Yesterday I was thinking this was not worth the effort. Today, after seeing how my dog turns down other treats in favor of these, I have to say I will make them again.  Do not use cutters that are too large if you want to get lots of treats. I doubled the recipe.  I also used a cat cookie cutter just because it amused me!

Great, easy recipe. The dough was such a nice consistency and rolled out so nicely for me (and I always have trouble rolling sugar cookie dough!). I used beef broth in place of milk & beef boullion and honey instead of sugar. Smelled great in the oven and my dogs really seem to enjoy them! I'll definitely try a variation with peanut butter in the future.

My dogs loved these! I unfortunately didn't have oatmeal so I crushed up some Total cereal and used that - it made the treats smell a lot like Total, but the dogs still loved them! As other suggested, I substituted the cheddar cheese and bouillon, but I used 3/4 cup of peanut butter and 1/2 cup of apple sauce., which also allowed me to omit the white sugar. The dough is sticky but the more you knead it and roll it out with whole wheat flour, the better it is to work with!

Made these last night for my puppies - they camped out beneath my feet, patiently waiting for whatever smelled so good to be fed to them!  I didn't use the builloin cubes b/c we didn't have any, but they still tasted great - even my husband liked them!  I used miniature Christmas cookie cutters, and one batch made approximately 200 mini treats.  These are going to make great gifts for all my dog-loving friends!

I can't really give this a fair review seeing I've never actually tasted it but if my dogs tailwags were enough to rate I'd give 10 stars. It baked for 27 minutes and I left it out over night so it would be less soggy. Also you could totally sneak n anything in here seeing as my dog will eat anything (cat poop, dental floss, ect.) except for her vitamins which I will sneak in next time.

My pooch Tasha loved 'em!! Very Simple, and they smell good...no, i haven't tried one yet ;P
My dog pukes whenever she has cheese so i switched that for peanut butter...worked great! I had to add quite a bit of extra flour to get it right...about 3/4 cup...no big deal though!
My doggie is VERY appreciative of the creator of this recipe!! =D

Amazing! I totally believe that you shouldn't feed your dog something you wouldn't eat, and this recipe works perfect! I made these with parmesan cheese, vegetable bouillon and egg whites, and they turned out great. My doggie loves them :)

Thank you for this recipe. We have two Mastiffs, who are big snackers. So I am always on the lookout for homemade treats. I made these this morning, and I guess I don't need to worry about the shelflife :) I used chicken stock, and garlic, also I only had a 4 blend cheese. These smelled so yummy I was tempted. I did not have a bone cookie cutter so I used a ginger bread man. Which turned out really cute. Another treat my pups really love are ice cubes. So I put chicken or beef stock in ice cube trays, and they love that as a summer treat. It's not enough of a recipe to earn it's own spot on here, but I thought your pups might enjoy it.

I have made these for my dog three times and she just loves them. They have been real god for training purposes. The only problem we have had, is the last few in the container have gotten moldy. Gonna try a tighter container this time.

This is a great recipe to use as a base and my dogs love it!  I substituted soy flour for the cornmeal and low sodium chicken broth for the milk, since neither is really that good for dogs (plus the soy and broth add extra protein).    I made two flavors: ham and cheese by substituting ham drippings for the bouillon and peanut butter by substituting peanut butter for the cheese.  Both were big hits with both my dogs and all the dogs who came by my table at the craft fair!    Every one of them begged for more.

My dogs went crazy over these. I may not have baked them long enough because they are not very hard, so I decided to taste one and they are really good! Due to the problems with store bought dog foods and treats lately, I will make these every week for our three poodles.

Steve, my dog goes nuts when I bake because of the smells omitting from the oven.  He layed there waiting for a morsel of a baked good to drop, not realizing that it actually was for him.  Anyway, when I gave him one, he took off under the computer desk and horded as if it were a soup bone!  He loved them, and I love the fact that I know that they are all natural!  Thanks Donna!!

My dogs love these treats! Instead of the beef bullion I use puree chicken liver from our chickens and I also leave out the milk because the liver is plenty of liquid. Sometimes I also sub out the cornmeal since it's not great for dogs and use wheat germ either way they go nuts for it! Thanks so much for sharing the recipe.

This was a great recipe and easy to work with. I omitted the sugar and I did use crushed grahm crackers insted of corn meal because I heard it's not good for dogs. I also added 2 tablespoons natural peanut butter. My boxer loved them!

Awesome.  I did what another user suggested and substituted peanut butter for the cheese and bullion. Also, I didn't have margarine so butter was used instead.  I "pulsed" the oats in a food processor before adding the other ingredients and was able to use my cookie press for these (larger die).  The only other thing I'd do differently would be to cut back on the butter by a couple of tbsp, as the dough ended up kind of greasy to the point of pooling in the press when I was done.

I am making this recipe for my dog right now for his birthday present. It was very quick and easy to make, and it called for everything I had in the pantry. I used all purpose flour instead of whole wheat and added a bit more and it was just the right consistency. I changed the size to 1 dozen and you don't need a lot of each ingredient then.Nothing more than 3/4 cup! So if you're short on ingredients, 1 dozen is just fine, I think. I used water when it was too thick and it was great. I can smell the treats baking right now...mmmm! Well, I hope my border collie/sheltie named Coal likes them!

No kidding - the dogs came to attention in the kitchen the minute I started this recipe and didn't leave until they had eaten several warm cookies each. Can't figure out how they knew it was for them though, as the ingredients are all just regular food items. Easy to make, no special ingredients to buy and they rolled out and cut better than most regular cookie recipes! I got about 2 1/2 cups of the flour incorporated before it wouldn't take any more. Only problem I had was my 6 year old kept eating the raw dough, and then nibbling on the baked biscuits. I plan to make these for the next bake sale I'm involved in as I think many people would love to buy these treats for their dog, and they can't use the excuse that they're on a diet. Also, I used small cookie cutters of gingerbread girls and boys and probably got closer to 6 dozen treats out of this recipe!!

my doggies were "ok" with these. Kind of pushed them around a bit, but finally ate them. The dough is great to work with, nice consistancy. Oh, I did use someone's advice and subbed penut butter for the broth. Next time maybe I will strictly follow the recipe. Really cute though.

My first attempt at making dog treats for my two mini schnauzers!  they love them! =) Based on the prior reviews (thank you!), I used wheat germ instead of corn meal, honey instead of sugar, reduced cheese to 1/2 cup, omitted beef bouillon granules, and added 3 tablespoons of peanut butter.  I will definitely be making more of these for the dogs. =)

My dog LOVED these.  She stood by the oven during the last few minutes trying to get to what was inside!  Sometimes I make them sweet with the peanut butter and sometimes savory with 1 cup cheddar cheese and 1 teaspoon beef buillon.  She enjoyed both.  I make a whole batch, freeze most in ziplock bags, and take them out a bag at a time.  They will mold if left out too long.

I used 1 cup of ground flax seed for 1 of the cups of wheat flour and added about 2 tablespoons of leftover turkey. 
Next batch I'm going to remove the cornmeal (can be a problem for dogs with allergies) and will substitute something else (rice flour, barley flour, almond flour, instant potatoes, oatmeal, ground flax seed, etc.)
The dogs would've devoured these immediately if I had let them, but they _were_ meant to be their Christmas cookies.  The most finicky of my crew gave her nod of approval and quickly came back for more.  
Since I have several Danes I think next time I need to quadruple the recipe.  :)

Oh My Gosh these smelled so good baking that I almost ate one when they came out of the oven.  I made them just like the recipe and my Molly loved them.  I found Martha Stewart dog cookie cutters at Petsmart last weekend.  They were in a set of three (small, medium and large).  I couldn't wait to bake some treats and found this recipe that turned out to be easy and good.  Thanks!

Time to make the dog treats! My dachshunds adore these, but FREEZE them in batches for the dogs...they get MOLDY. No preservatives in them which is a good thing. (And include that instruction if you give them for gifts.)
I hate bouillion cubes so will use "Trader Joe's Better than Bouillion".
One other thing, cheese is rich and can be binding to the digestive system of doggies,so I limit them to one or two a day. The don't need too much of a good thing!

Dogs enjoyed these very much. I doubled the recipe and I made about 150 cookies using a 3" dog bone cutter and rolling my dough to 1/8" to 1/4" thick. Not necessary to grease the pans or to space the cookies - they do not spread. I substituted boiling beef broth for the boiling water and omitted the bouillion for less sodium. I also turned the cookies once the bottoms were browned for even color and crispness. Thanks for sharing!!

My dog seemed to love these treats.  I made some for other dogs in our complex and will give an update as to how they liked them after I get some feedback.  It was super easy to make.  I am going to try and find a way to add beef broth instead of the beef granules as they are FAR too salty to be good for any animal.

Great recipe!  Since my pup has some food allergies, I did make a few adjustments, substituting coconut oil for the margarine (great for skin and coat), no sugar or cornmeal (not good for animals), 1/2 c. extra oats, and brown rice flour instead of wheat (makes for a crisper biscuit also).  I have also subbed a small jar of baby food chicken, beef etc. instead of the bouillon and/or 1/2 cup pumpkin or sweet potato with 2 tsp. of powdered milk instead of the 1/2 cup of milk. I have found this to be the best base recipe for dog treats that is easily adaptable to your dog's preferences! Thanks so much!

I used a 1/3 cup peanut butter instead of the 1/3 cup margarine and my dogs love them.

I had some very bitter medicine I had to give one of my dogs. She loved the treats so much she would eat it even with the medicine smeared over the top, tried to eat the bottom first, but eventually ate the whole thing.

Omitted the sugar and replaced with Agave nectar and replaced margarine with olive oil.  Also made a peanut butter version...taking out the cheese and bouillon.

Both chihuahuas love them!

My dogs love these, as do all the neighbor dogs.  We bake them and give them as gifts for the holidays.  Sometimes I roll them out thinly and run a sharp, floured knife vertically and horizontally, making tiny squares.  The dough is substantial enough to just scoop them up with a spatula and put them on the pan for baking.  We foster dogs and use the little squares as training treats/rewards.  They work great and store well in a sealed ziploc bag or plastic container.  We keep them near the doors so they are easily accessible when housebreaking.

My little dog loves these. I substituted brown rice for corn meal since corn meal isn't healthy for dogs. Also, I didn't have any milk so I used chicken broth. I also used white flour instead of whole wheat. Lots of variations can be used in this recipe and still comes out great!

Great Recipe and can be altered in so many ways with different flavors, grains, etc.  I used chicken bouillon granules and oil instead of margarine.  Our Lucy LOVES these and we have shared them with all her doggy friends.  We humans even tasted em!  Pretty good actually, for doggy treats but think I'll stick with my homemade whole wheat.  Good, solid basic recipe with good results.  An extra egg helps them to be a bit softer for older doggies to chew. Woof!

I made these tonight for our 4 dogs. I like the recipe because you can use all organic ingredients. I made these in my food processor up to the kneading point. The dough comes together very quickly and easily. I didn't have a bone cookie cutter, so i rolled these out and cut into squares with a pizza cutter, then scored each square with the back of a knife. They smell pretty good, and if I didn't tell my fiancee that they were for the dogs, he would have eaten them! Easy Easy Easy and simple. If you have a dog you should make these! I'm going to try the peanut butter version next!

Wow!  These are great, first batch as directed, second adding 1/2 cup peanut butter instead of cheese, third time, adding 1/3 cup minced garlic in olive oil instead of cheese.  My grand-dogs love them all!!!

I made these the other day for my dog, Monday. She went absolutely crazy and stood by the oven waiting for them to be done. I cut the recipe in half and used the whole egg and I also left out the cornmeal. I but both peanut butter and some cheese in them because she loves them both so much! These were easy to roll out and cut. I found a cute dog bone shaped cookie cutter at Wal-Mart and I used it. I think I will make these a staple in our house!

These treats look and smell quite plain but my two dogs go crazy for them!  I didn't have any cornmeal so I substituted with some more whole wheat flour, and swapped most of the cheese for peanut butter to keep the cost down.
Also as I don't have cutters I just rolled out the dough and cut into squares using a pizza wheel - quick and easy!

My dogs can't get enough of these tasty treats! When baking, place them close on the sheet to save space, as they don't spread/get bigger.  So fun to use with cute packaging to give dog lovers as gifts!

My boyfriend's sister says her Jack Russel won't eat the treats she bought at the store anymore!!! My friend says that her Golden Retriever went nuts for them!!! I made these far away from any of the dogs, but these obviously made for good Christmas presents for the dogs. Great recipe. Two paws way up!

Sugar, cornmeal, and bouillon are not very good for dogs. Good substitutes would be honey, more flour, and some peanut butter. I would also substitute margarine for olive oil. Another thing i wouldn't use is the cheese for it could give your dog extreme gas issues.Since it is fresh with no preservatives, i would freeze the biscuits for a longer shelf life.

I halved the recipe and did not make any changes.  My 7yo milkbone hating pomeranian and 3yo not food motivated shepherd mix ate them right away.   The pom was camped out at my feet waiting for them to be done.  I'm eager to try the peanut butter, bacon grease, nutritional yeast, and graham cracker variations suggested in the reviews!

I have a dog who is aging gracefully and she loves the treat! I roll them very thin and treats are easy on her teeth.

I haven't made dog biscuits before and this was a great, easy way for my kids to make homemade biscuits for our 5 month old lab.  They had so much fun doing it and the recipe was easy to do.  One piece of advice I did was in stirring in all that flour...by the time I got to adding the last cup the dough was so incredibly stiff that I used my hands and it worked wonderfully.  The dough itself wasn't sticky, and rolled out beautifully without having to flour my counter.  Our puppy loves them, then again she'll eat anything!

My dog loved these!  I also passed them out to some of her fave dog friends and they all loved them as well.  Huge hit!  I kept them in an airtight container for a week and then put the container in the fridge to be safe.

This is fun to make, pretty easy too, and my friend's dog just loved them!  I am going to make them again for another friend's dogs.  I used Swiss cheese instead b/c that's all I had; next time I'll use Cheddar.

Thank you for the recipe! These were easier to make than I would have guessed! My dog loved them! His tail was wagging like crazy when he tasted them! I used butter instead of margarine and they worked out fine.

Wow! I couldn't believe my dogs loved these! I did alter it which I normally don't do on recipes but I know that cornmeal isn't good for dogs so I found some brown rice flour in the pantry, (don't ask me why I had that in there), and replaced the cornmeal with that. I also omitted the sugar just because I didn't feel they would miss it. I didn't have bouillon granules so I used some "Better Than Bouillon" that I had leftover in the fridge. I'm going to try this with an egg subsitute next time. I also think I'll roll this to a 1/4" thick next time because they rise a bit and it was almost still to "soft" to be a biscuit like consistancy which is why I think some reviewers said they had mold after a few days.  It was almost like a soft cookie/bread texture. I'll repost my results soon!

We doubled the recipe (we have 2 dogs, plus gave some as Christmas presents to friends with dogs) and used peanut butter instead of the cheese and beef bouillon because we wanted it to last longer... and our dogs LOVE them.  Best of all, we made loads which will last us a really long time and save us money on dog treats :) Great recipe, thank you!

My Two dogs love these treats! They drool all over the floor as they are munching them down. The puppy-dog eyes that they give me when the first one's gone and they're hoping for another is price less. Thanks for the submission.

My German Wirehaired Pointer Cosmo loves these!  He has a very sensitive stomach, so I left out the cornmeal and added a bit more oatmeal, as I think corn is part of his problem.  I also think wheat germ would be a good substitution for the corn meal, but I didn't have any on hand.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and it was very easy.  I used a small gingerbread man cookie cutter and they turned out really cute!  I'm going to take some to my cookie exchange party for the hostess' dogs.  Next time I may try peanut butter instead of beef and cheese, but I will definitely be making them again.

My dogs loved these!!  They were circling me like sharks.  I did make some changes.  Instead of the bouillon cubes (thought they had too much salt and msg) I used 1 jar of chicken and rice baby food.  And I omitted the milk but only b/c I didn't have any.  Luckily the baby food added the extra moisture and they turned out perfect!  I also happened to have bone shaped cookie cutters.  I will definitely make these again...next time I think I'll add peanut butter too! thanks for the recipe. =) and my dogs thank you too!

Very easy recipe. I made half a batch and added a bit of peanut butter (1/3 cup or so). Cut them into little one-inch heart sized treats.  My dogs came in from outside while these were baking - coincidence or not?  They loved them. These do not spread on the sheet at all while cooking, so they can be put very close together.

I've made this recipe multiple times and my dog (Rat Terrier) LOVES them.  He's a very picky eater as well.  Here're my tips:

1. HALF the recipe. The shelf life is much much shorter than store-bought dog treats and unless you can go through them relatively quickly, they will go bad.

2. Experiment with other ingredients: my dog loved Parmesan cheese in replacement of cheddar. Also, peanut butter was a good addition, maybe even bacon bits!

I made these for Christmas for all the dog family members.  I used the dog bone shaped cookie cutter for the larger dogs and small christmas cookie cutters (Wilton has a set of 10 mini cookie cutters) for the rest. I made two batches, one beef & chedder and one with peanut butter.  My dogs LOVE these!  If they see me even come close to where I keep these treats, they go crazy!

I made the mistake of having chicken bullion CUBES instead of granular, and I realized too late in the recipe, so I left it out and used peanut butter instead. I also used 75% reduced fat cabot cheddar cheese and put a tid bit of ham or pepporoni in the middle so it looked like a "thumbprint" cookie. Every dog that tried these (4 in all) loved them. Easy to make, will make again.

Super easy to make!  My two dogs loved these...the puppy barked for more!  I substituted 1/2 cup chicken broth instead of milk.  Added only 1/2 of cheddar cheese and included 1/3 cup of crunchy peanut butter.  Next time I will add a bit more of the cheddar to give it some more zing.  But, all in all, great recipe that the dogs love!  I'm making a ton of these to give as Christmas gifts to my kids' friend's dogs.

My dogs LOVED these treats!  How do I know?  Because every time I took the container out of the cupboard they would absolutley loose their mind!  They don't even get this excited over fillet mignon scraps!  They are a bit time consuming, but I believe well worth the effort!  Oh by they way, My mother- in-law wanted to see what all the fuss was about, so she tried one!  She said she understands how   a dog would love these so much!

i just made this and the recipe was very easy to follow.  since i didnt have cornmeal or shredded cheese on hand, i made a peanut butter version instead.  i substituted the cornmeal with AP flour, margarine with veggie oil & butter and the cheese/boullion with unsalted smooth peanut butter.  they baked up beautifully.  my furbaby, charlie, loves them.  thank you!

Every year I bake cookies for my neighbors, but this year I made cookies for their dogs, too.  Of course, I gave some of the treats to my dog, as well.  I used cookie cutters to cut out most of the treats, but since my dog is a very small Chihuahua, I made hers by rolling out lengths of dough into a rope, and then I just cut the rope at 3/4" intervals.  Doing this made the treats much easier for her to chew and saved me the trouble of breaking up each cookie for her.  Not as cute, but Lola didn't complain.  All the dogs loved these, and one of my neighbors even asked me for the recipe.  Donna, thanks for sharing.

I decided to try these for my cat.  The dough was easy to roll, and I used a pizza cutter to cut them into cat bite sized pieces.  You can get lots of them on a cookie sheet because they don't spread.  Unfortunately, my cat turns her nose up at them.  I don't think it's fair to rate this recipe because it's designed for dogs, not cats, but wanted to give a little input in case anyone else was thinking of trying them for their cat.  Now I have to find a dog to give all these little treats to.

I don't know what it is about these treats but the dogs do love them! They smelled like pot pies while they were baking. We have 2 beagles and they keep begging for these treats!!! My husband also took some to his parents' house where they have a beagle who is a very, very picky eater and she loved these treats as well..everyone was stunned! They even gave her a choice between a piece of roasted chicken that just came out of the oven and a treat and she chose the treat! These were really easy to make,although I did not have a cookie cutter so I just rolled out the dough and cut into squares (not like the dogs care what they look like!). I will make on a regular basis. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I changed the recipe.  I put bacon shortening instead of margarine, added flax seed, parsley, and changed the sugar to molasses.  The dogs loved them.  They are crunchy. I also used mozzarella cheese. 
I will definitely make them again.

All 5 dogs I have made these for just love them.The last one was a friend's dog that I pet sat. She said I either had to give her the recipe or move in! And my mom even tried one! Have tried a few other recipes but this is definitely the best! I can make 'cookies' without gaining a pound!

We have 4 dogs and made these to celebrate 2 of their birthdays. My 8 and 10 year old were in charge and I was in a more managerial role; this is a terrific recipe to do with kids as it is very forgiving! Based on some of the reviews and our dogs preferences, we made quite a few changes: omitted the boullion, cheese, cornmeal, margarine and sugar. We also substituted brown rice flour for the wheat. In place of the eliminated ingredients, we used 1/2 unsweetened organic applesauce (our one dog LOVES apples), olive oil as the fat, 1 c fresh ground honey roasted peanuts ground to peanut butter consistency, 1/2 c oat bran, 1/4 c ground flax seed a d increased the oats a bit. The biscuits were a huge hit not only with our dogs, but extras were shared with the neighbors and friends who have dogs and they were devoured! This recipe is clearly one you can play with and easily adjust to your dogs taste. This was a fun family baking activity; I would definitely recommend!

I made these "cookies" for our Chu-weenie, this morning. omigoodness, our pup is such a happy camper. after reading reviews, I made these changes. lost the corn, which is just a filler, dogs cannot digest corn. and replaced volume w the whole wheat flour (extra 1/4 c) and oats, 2 c instead of one. I also replaced margarine w bacon grease. then finally chopped bacon, and added to oat mixture. everything else was as written. My dog is all over these cookies. whenever I head into the kitchen shes right with me. thanks for the post

I did not add any bullion as I don't want to give my dog that much salt. Also, substituted the wheat flour and cornmeal for brown rice flour. Much better for a dogs digestive system and for dogs who have food allergies. Substituted the cheddar with natural peanut butter. Healthy and a nice sweet treat. Many dogs like sweets and this is a way to give them sweet without sugar.

I have made this before (and thought I reviewed it, but I guess not), and my dogs love it!  I have tried it as written, and have changed it up by using chicken bouillon and mozzarella cheese.  But never have the "pupper-azzi" gone quite so crazy for them as they did over the batch I made today- I had some roasted pumpkin leftover, so on a whim I subbed the pumpkin in for the milk.  I wasn't sure if the flavors would work, but all three of my dogs are thrilled with the results.  (Of course they have been known to snack from the kitty litter box, so their tastes may not be as discerning as some ;)).  Any way I have made these, they have been a success, and they will be going out in my holiday gift baskets to my friends and family with dogs this year.  Thanks for a terrific recipe :)

Our doggy really loved these treats for his birthday.  He ate too many, though, and got the runnies.  Oops!  Hey--we felt like he should be able to over-indulge a little on his big day.  From now on, just one a day.  Also, this recipe makes a TON of cookies--we've got a lot of them and I ended up freezing half of the dough for another time.

This is a great treat! My dog, who usually hates dog cookies, goes nuts for these things! She stalks me to the freezer to make sure I wont forget about her goodies. I've never seen her so excited to eat a cookie.
The recipe is easy and I know my dogs aren't eating junk!

Excellent! I cut these into little squares to use for training (probably about 3/4 inch) also rolled a little bit thinner. Because of that they baked in about 18 minutes. But they were very easy to make, dough was really easy to work with and the dog LOVES them!

I don't know what I did wrong but, YUK!!  !. The dough was terrible to handle. Determined to use bread dough hook next time.  But, deccided NO next time!  2. Storage... Placed in closed container, actually  a  3 pound, washed  and dried coffee ontainer. 6 days later thery were mold ridden.  I let them set out for 3 hours before putting them in storage. 3. I would enjoy a simple "treat" recipe. That is reliable.. So many positive ratings...perhaps it was my fault, but I had to vent.

These were really easy and fun to make. I gave them to eight different dogs for Christmas and every dog, even the picky ones, loved them! From schnauzers to beagles to dachshunds to collies, this treat pleases everyone! :-)

These are great! They took about 30 minutes to bake using the tiny bone cookie cutters, and came out looking adorable! My dog prefers the peanut butter and pumpkin dog treats on this site, but she devours them both. I will definitely be making this recipe again and again (and again and again and again...)!

The dogs are going crazy for these cookies.  I had some leftover scraps from a roast.  I boiled them to make a broth and used that + the chopped scraps for the boiling water and beef bouillon.  I will definitely be making these again.

My dog (a black lab) loved these. I heard a lot of bad things about dogs and cornstarch, so I omitted the cornstarch, added more rolled oats and wheat flour. I also did the receipe with only Peanut Butter (which was a hit) and I did the beef and cheese which they also loved.

My pug loves these. He's a little picky about his treats, so I'm glad to have found this. So much cheaper than store-bought too. I had some bacon grease in the pan from breakfast, so I used that instead of the margerine. I'm going to make some more next week for my friends with doggies.

I substituted the beef bouillon and the cheese for peanut butter. I did not add margarine. I cut the treats in small squares since our pups are in training. They LOVE these. I keep them in my pockets for good behavior - The dough is so easy to work with and they make the house smell wonderful while baking. My son came in while I was baking them and asked if we were having Pizza for dinner.I will make these over and over using different variations. I like that I can control the ingredients in these and know that my pups are getting healthy , fresh snacks. I kept a jarful on the counter and froze the rest of them in a ziploc bag to keep them fresh. Thank you for this great recipe!

My Patterdale Terrier, Chase, would not stop hovering around the oven while these were baking! I used chicken boullion and separated the dough into 2 batches, added finely chopped carrots to half. Grating the carrots would work too, but I liked the texture that the chunks gave. If your cookie cutters are sharp, you shouldn't have a problem cutting through the carrots. Thanks!

Great Recipe! I've made these regularly as three dogs go through them quickly. I refrigerate half of the batch to keep them from spoiling (which they will) in a week or so.

Our dogs loved these! All the neighbours are asking for the recipe too as I gave them a few for their dogs! I substituted the cheese for peanut-butter and they were a hit! I think next time I'll try the cheese version.

This recipe uses already-in-your-pantry ingredients and are simple to make. I found mini christmas cookie cutters to make little treats for my baby pomeranian, and he just loved them. Adjust cooking times for smaller treats, mine were only 10 minutes per batch in the oven. Plus, they do not look different when cooked, just a little lighter. Check the bottoms to see if they are done. I used colby instead of cheddar and it worked fine. Probably would be easy to leave out the boullion and add in peanut butter to make peanut butter flavored.

I have a german shepherd that is very picky about her treats, but she absolutely loves these and can't seem to get enough.
I was short on whole wheat flour so I used half whole wheat and half all purpose. Thanks Donna for a great recipe.Will definately be making lots more of these

Wow, talk about STIFF dough!  I don't know if you can get all three cups of flour worked in!  I can only hope all that intense kneading of the dough won't hurt anything.  These are in the oven...  we'll see what Puppy thinks!

My little Shih Tzu loved these biscuits! She could smell them cooking and sat by the oven door waiting for them to come out! I didn't have any beef bouillon, so I substituted with a grated up dog liver treat, which worked out fine. Based on my dog's reaction, these biscuits were a hit and I'll be sure to make them again!!

Made these for my grandpuppy and he just loved them.  So did the neighbors dogs.  I didn't have a cookie cutter so I just cut squares and baked them up.  It was fun.

My dog gobbles these treats up! I tried another recipe for dog treats and my microwave exploded. Literally. There was glass everywhere. Of course I tried a new recipe, which is this, and was totally the opposite. My dad joked around and ate one of these, and he said it tasted like meat flavored dough. :P Thhese are a lifesaver and we don't waste any money on dog treats.

My dogs won't eat store bought treats!  I omit the corn meal and will add a packet of yeast, or today I added a packet of chicken gravy with the cheese.  I've done both the cheese and peanut butter variations and have had great luck!  It's so easy to work with and any dog that tries them likes them.  Even my kids sneak them, lol!

Easy and the pups love it! This recipe is very easy to conform to your pup's wants (and what you have in the fridge). 

Changes I made:
I used coconut oil rather than margarine
I used pork bouillon rather than beef
I used Masa rather than corn meal
I used Quick oats rather than rolled oats

I added 1 cup of shredded carrots
I added 2 tsp. rendered bacon fat

I also omitted the sugar.

Next time I'll probably try an egg wash on top of the cookies, just for a better look. I'll also try this with different things like shredded apple, peanut butter, bananas, or whatever I have around that my pup can easily digest.

I'll be honest, I tried a tiny bite myself, and they weren't bad! LOL.

These biscuits don't raise, they will stay the exact shape you cut them.  There is no need to leave much space between them on the pan.  Also, after the first pan I rolled them thinner, they are a better size to for the dog to chew.  Dogs all gave them two paws up!

To save time, we just cut them into little rectangles with a pizza cutter, my dogs really don't seem to notice when I don't use the cookie cutters  :)

This recipe is extremely forgiving, I omit the cornmeal and the sugar and add another dry ingredient or just more flour to make up for it. The dogs always love them, no matter what I substitute.

I made a few changes to this recipe and every dog I have given them too, loves them. I have to say, this dough is very easy to work with. Instead of margarine, I used coconut oil. I substituted cornmeal(which isn't good for dogs)with cream of wheat cereal. I used local raw honey instead of sugar,and 3/4 c.organic peanut butter in place of beef bouillon(too much salt). I omitted cheese and replaced with 1/2 c. applesauce(unsweetened). Used 2 beaten eggs and finally replaced 1 cup of wheat flour with 1 cup of coconut flour. I added some parsley flakes and a little cinnamon. Another note, since the cookies don't expand when baking, I placed them almost touching to get more on the cookie sheet. I used a small bone shaped cookie cutter 2" long and it made over 160 cookies. Next time I will cut the recipe in half.  Baked 40 minutes. I also store the cookies in an airtight container in the refrigerator. This recipe is a winner for us.

After reading a ton of reviews this is what I ended up doing- 1 cup rolled oats, 1 cup boiling water, 1/3 cup olive oil (and then let sit for 10 mins). Then I added in the egg, 1 cup natural peanut butter, 1/2 cup chicken broth, 1/2 cup apple sauce, 2 tsp honey, and then the 3 cups of whole wheat flour. I used a bone shaped cookie cutter that is like 4 inches long and it made 90 treats (my treats were on the thin side)! Thanks for all the suggestions everyone!

My little dog has kidney problems and the vet said she should have NO protein.  She is such a picky eater but LOVES her snacks which, unfortunately, have so much protein.  Milk Bone box said 20%.  This only has the egg.

The vet pointed me to some low protein canned food, one 3%, one 5%, which to my surprise she snarfed down.  She had to look at these and think about it but has asked for several this evening.  I made 1/2 batch in case she wouldn't eat them.]

The dough is very easy to work with.  I just cut the rolled out dough into little squares.. very quick and easy.

I'll be using this recipe weekly.  Thanks to the person putting this on the site.

My dog is addicted to these. I used a cup of peanut butter instead of the cheddar cheese. I can't even go near the container without him begging for them. I don't bother making them look all fancy either. I roll it out and cut it in serving size portions with a pizza cutter. My dog doesn't care what they look like...they just taste soooo yummy to him.

Our boxer Jocko will not eat other dog treats anymore!  I use the peanut butter as suggested by another review.  One thing, rolling them out to 1/2 inch is too thick, it should be more like 1/4 inch or you will end up with a treat that is to moist to store for long.  For the critical review that mentioned the short shelf life, if the treat isn't dry enough, it will get bad fast, but if you roll it thinner and bake them till they're dry, they store fine.  Can't give a length of time, because Jocko goes through them too fast to find out!  LOL  But when I make a double batch, they last 2-3 weeks just fine.  I do mine at 1/4 inch thick, and bake for the max 45 minutes.  I've used other types of cheese, whatever I have that's getting old in my fridge, and he loves them all.  My daughter fosters animals for a local humane society, and now she makes these also for her always changing menagerie.  Even some of the cats like them.

I used the recommendation to omit the cheese and bullion and add one cup of peanut butter instead. I recommend mixing in an electric mixer since it's a thick dough. I used pie crust decorator cut-outs (stars, chickens, mini ginger bread man...) I rated this recipe 4 stars because they're not super healthy for a dog's natural diet. They came out as a great consistency and held together beautifully. I gifted them to friends with dogs for Christmas.

2 of my 3 dogs are picky eaters and all 3 of my dogs BEG for more! I substitue OUT the Milk, Hot water, Bouillon cubes, and Wh. Wheat flour for: 1 cup boiling chicken/beef stock, 1/3 cup Peanut butter, and use Rye flour instead. If you don't want to add the corn-substitute it out for Equal amounts more of the : Rye, and Oats:) Freeze for a Christmas day treat for your furry Family members! IF you REALLY want to spoil them, you could also add 1/3 cup Baccon Bits (Homeade of course, crumbled fried 3 strips)! I personally Baked for 20 mins and then turn off oven for 20mins leaving them in to Harden.

Super bummed.  Of course, if I'd followed the recipe exactly, I wouldn't be in this exact situation.  I decided to give these a try while making chicken pot pie, so after my veggies and chicken were cooking (in bouillon) I scooped out a cup of boiling water and added that to the oats and margarine mix.  I was planning to finish the treats once my pie was in the oven......

HOWEVER, I decided to google a couple ingredients first.  Onion is super toxic to dogs and it seems like most bouillon has onion powder in it.  Also, it wasn't low sodium, which is another big issue.

So, I ruined my recipe before I even started.  I know, if I'd used water at the beginning, I might have caught this in time.  BUT, it would have been nice to see a warning.  Also, if I hadn't searched, I would have used the same bouillon crumbles in the recipe anyway.

I'm disappointed, because I LOVE allrecipes and this was the most popular and most highly rated recipe.  But, I'd rather stick to unhealthy but SAFE storebought treats over something toxic for my pup.

Perhaps some of the PB adaptations would be a better choice.

I originally found this recipe because I'd become a vegetarian, but had a ton of meat based bouillon to use up.  I have cats, not dogs, so when I've made these treats they've been gifts for friends.  I've never watched a pet eat them, but I always hear rave reviews.

This is a great recipe that you can change to fit your dogs taste buds.  You can use chicken bouillon instead of beef, change the cheese to peanut butter and add a touch of garlic powder.  Two Tablespoons of garlic will help with flea control.  Be careful with the garlic though, large quantities of garlic can harm your dog.

I am kinda slow on writing this review but I made these for my dog, Lucky, as well as friends/neighbors dogs for Christmas. All of Lucky's friends were delighted with their gift. I have recipe requests from their 4-legged parents. Thanks so much for sharing!

It's a hit!  I followed recipe exactly only I added a scoop of peanut butter.  I didn't have a cookie cutter so I just rolled the dough and sliced.  
After the cookies were cooled I placed one next to the usual treat (store bought dog biscuit) and she went straight for these and never looked back!

I made these today for my 2 dogs. They absolutely love them!! I am very happy to have found this recipe. These are actually pretty good for them nutrition wise. I think next time I will listen to a few of the suggestions to see how they come out when substituting peanut butter for the margarine. Thanks for the awesome recipe!!

Love making these, more importantly my dogs love them. They are fresh and I know every ingredient in them. Love the idea of using peanut butter in place of margarine that another reviewer suggested. I will try that next. Also great to baggie up and give to all the pups around holidays. Thank you Doughmama.

I baked these today for my three dogs and they loved them! My schipperke, Shazza, is a very finicky eater and yet she had three. If she eats them then they must be great! I know I will be using this recipe over and over. Thanks!

My dog loves these.  I eliminated the sugar but kept the rest the same.  The dough is very easy to work with and although the kneading was more than I wanted to do, it really wasn't that hard.  I am putting them in Christmas treat bags for our friends with pets.  Makes enough to put several in each bag!  Thanks for the recipe!

my pooch loves these. I replaced the cornmeal with wheat bran, because I didn't have any. I also replaced the margarine with canola oil. The only reason I gave these 4 stars instead of 5 is because they lack nutrients. If I make them again, I will probably add grated veggies or meat.

I made these with peanut butter instead of the cheese and the dogs went nuts for them.  I want to try a different flavor the next time.  This is a great recipe for beginners like me. I did burn a few but my dogs didn't care.

My dogs loved these! Next time I will bake them for a shorter time as my dogs prefer softer treats- they really liked the raw dough. Baking these for the full time makes them very crunchy.

I've made these for the past few years, my lab loves them!  I reduce the flour to 2 1/2 cups to keep the dough from cracking.  And sometimes I use chicken bouillon instead of beef.  Since this makes so many treats, I usually freeze half or store in refrigerator.  If they are left at room temperature for over a week, they will get mildew on them.  Great recipe!!!

This is a fantasic (ally simple) dog treat recipe. I have made it a couple of times now, and our boxer Izzie "knows" whenever I'm making them and doesn't move from my side! I didn't have a bone shaped cookie cutter the first time I made them, so instead I used an apple slicer (metal ring with 6-8 wedges inside to core and slice apples) which produced the perfect bite sized treat, especially for training bits. 
I've made the recipe as written so far, but I plan on using other suggestions listed here such as substituting chicken for beef boullion and using peanut butter.

Best of all, if you are concerned about the amount of preservatives are in food nowadays, this is an excellent recipe since it is all natural (minus boullion).

Happy baking!

My dog loves them. I substituted honey for the sugar, switched a third of the flour for wheat germ to make it healthier, and added a bit more cheese. I also chopped the recipe in half because I have a small dog and my freezer is full of treats.

I have 3 dogs. 2 of my dogs will eat anything, my 3rd dog is very selective (she has turned down expensive treats) and they all love these treats. I have replaced the cheese with peanut butter once, and my dogs didn't seem to like them as well. Make sure you keep these treats in a air-tight container. I will continue making these!

Made this last night and my dogs did actually stand at the foot of the oven door while I removed the biscuits. I put them on cooling racks and the dogs "whined" until biscuits were cool enough to eat. How do they know?! Gave some to three more dogs today and they all went nuts over these biscuits! A definate keeper.

What a great recipe and easy to make. My Labrador couldn't believe something coming out of the oven was for him, he scarfed them down and drooled all over the kitchen floor. Since my lab loves peanut butter I added it as well.

I haven't found a dog who won't gobble these up!  They make great seasonal canine gifts (which your dog loving friends will appreciate!) if you use themed cookie cutters, wrap them in pretty plastic, and tie a ribbon around.  Adding a little extra liquid helps them roll better.  Be careful not to burn if you roll them thin!

I made these in beef and chicken and handed them out to dog owners for Christmas. I also gave some to my "neice", a cocker spaniel. She tore into the package under the tree before we had a chance to stop her! I have received several requests to make again!

absolutely excellent!  I made these with my friends 7 year old, we had a blast!  I hate to bake, and this dough was very easy to work with.  I'll be using this from now on.  Thank you so much!

My dogs love these!  My 7 month old bloodhound stands at the edge of the counter and nibbles at the dough while I'm rolling them out - I can't keep him out of the kitchen when I'm making these. This makes enough to last about 1 week with two large, spoiled dogs.  My dogs really ham things up trying to earn these treats - puppy training with the bloodhound is getting easier!

Recipe was pretty easy, and a good consistency to work with.  I made gifts for all my dog loving friends and used christmas cookie cutters.  Came out good and everyone said their dogs loved them and begged for more :)

I am giving this a 4 because it is a great healthy treat for dogs and they turned out great!  However, my dog could take them or leave them. That is probably my fault thought because she always get's human food that isn't too healthy for her and she would prefer that.

Easy and my pup loved them!  Not as crispy/hard as other treats I have made.  I omitted the cheese.  I didn't cut into shapes, just rolled it out and cut with my fluted pastry wheel into little squares.  Will make again.

My dog loved these! I didn't have any beef bouillon, so instead of the milk, I used beef broth. They turned out great. I have to admit I sampled these to see what they tasted like. I think next time I will use the beef bouillon to get a stronger flavor, but my dog loved them without it!

My Dos love these treats!  I feel like a slave to my dogs now.  everytime I open the draw i keep them in the come running.  I substituted peanutbutter fot the chesse and did not add the boullion.  (my dogs love peanutbutter)Also I rolled my dough out to 1/4" thickness so they dry out more then they are crunchy.  And the best thing is I know what my dogs are eating!  And they are cheap!

My dog loves his new treats - making 2nd batch today, will add a little peanut butter to see how that works out.  When baking - make sure they are a good 1/2 in or more away from each other.  Or you will be baking them longer.

This is the BEST dog treat recipes I've come across.  I give them for "doggie" gifts at Christmas, and my two dogs stand by the oven and wait for them to come out - it's the funniest thing!

I made these for Valentine treats for all the dogs in our neighborhood.  I shaped them into hearts and put their names on them.  All the dogs loved them and my neighbors thought they were so cute.  Easy dough to work with.

Molly says,"Arf-arf-arf-arf-arf" (five stars) and "Woof-woof, Donna" (Thank you, Donna)! I had to make a couple changes for things I didn't have on hand. I subed all purpose flour for the whole wheat but Molly didn't seem to mind at all. I didn't have a cookie cutter so I rolled them into 1 inch little balls and made 56 treats. She gobbled three of them up and begged for more!

I am sooo excited that I found this recipe and tried it.  One of our dogs is a very picky eater and we have never been able to find any treats in the stores that she likes.  I made these and she absolutely loves them and goes nuts for them.  We have already gone through a full batch and I'm about to make another.  I also got my mom's and my neighbor's dogs addicted to them as well.  Not only is it great that I found something that she likes, but it is just added bonus that they are all natural and going to save me lots of money.  Thanks a bunch for sharing.  These will be made regularly in our house.

These were very easy to make.  My dog seemed to really like them, but then, he'll eat anything.  I'll continue to make them for him because I like the idea of giving him home made treats.

Made this without cornmeal as it's not good for dogs. Used a little extra oats. I've now spoiled my dog. He was a dedicated Milk Bone dog. I tried to give him one today and he snubbed it!  He only wants his "puppy cookies". At least we know exactly what's in them. So easy to make. The next batch will be chicken and mozzarella flavored!

I really enjoyed making these. They were moderately easy and didn't make a huge mess. I substituted chicken stock because some of my dogs are allergic to beef.

My dogs loved it.  I didn't have any margerine, so I used real butter, but they still came out great. I like them crispier, so I rolled them out to 1/4 inch and cooked them crisp.

I am going to try this recipe.  But I will make some changes.  I would use olive oil instead of margarine, organic brown rice flour instead of whole wheat flour, take out the cornmeal, honey instead of sugar and low sodium chicken/beef broth instead of bouillon cube.  I can't wait to try this!

All my 3 dogs loved these cookies. Based on another review I made a few changes. I used olive oil instead of the butter and did not use the cornmeal. I used chicken bouillon because it was the only thing I had and I also added about 4 table spoon of crunchy peanut butter. I rolled the dough with a rolling pin and only used half of it. I ended up with about 30 cookies cut out with a bone and a dog shaped  cookie cutters. I froze the rest to be used later.

I have made these many times now and give them as gifts to friends who also have dogs.  I do not use cornmeal but will throw in leftover rice as we usually have it in the fridge.  I also flip the biscuits over half way through the baking time and find this makes for a crisper biscuit.  My husband LOVES them with red wine!!

I used oil instead of margarine and chicken bouillon instead of beef, but left everything else alone. This does make a lot, but I have two large dogs so they will go through these in no time. They literally followed me around the kitchen for more after I gave them one. I feel better about giving them treats from home, I will definitely make these again and again.

I made a double batch of these for an all day fundraiser, & they sold very well.  Cut dough out into doggie, bone, kitty & heart shapes - very easy.  Since dogs are supposed to avoid cornmeal, I substituted banana nut granola for the cornmeal (took out bigger nuts). Also, due to ingredients on hand, I sub'd Crisco for the margarine, & used steel cut oats. Used peanut butter instead of sugar.  I also used chicken bouillon instead of beef, because it seemed more compatible with peanut butter & granola, but how does a human really know!

What I like about this recipe is that it seems foolproof - you can make your own version for
natural ingredients, homemade cut out doggie treats. 

Easy to roll out & cut shapes. I used parchment paper on cookie sheets & put in top racks of oven, & did not burn bottoms of cookies, that was what was worrying me the most !  Just have to make sure that you give owners a heads up that treats contain peanut butter / nut granola, if their doggie has an allergy. 

This recipe is a real winner !

My dogs loved this but, I elected to substitute flax meal for corn meal and I used Knorr Chicken Bouillon because it was the only one I could find without onion. All of the beef ones I found had onion in them. I also used a soy based cheddar and brown rice flour and omitted the sugar. My border collie has an uber-sensitive stomach and these (with my changes) went down just fine. I brushed on a glaze made of egg yolk with cinnamon before baking for a little something extra.

I'm getting ready to make my 3rd batch for my Chihuahua's, they, along with other dog's I have given them to LOVE them!  I make them as the recipe is written.  I have read some reviews about substituting peanut butter, etc.  My thought is if I wanted a recipe with peanut butter I would search for that :)  Also read some concerns about onion in the bouillon, the one I have has onion powder listed as the 8th ingredient, and as we all know it's the first few ingredients that contain the most, so I'm not concerned about it.  A time saving tip I learned on the last batch was to ditch the little cookie cutter and just cut them into squares, my dog's don't seem to care what they look like :)

I am trying this recipe for the first time today and expect to be satisfied with it.  I have a warning, however: most commercial boullion contains onion.  Onion is a cumulative poison for dogs.  I would reccomend a different flavor enhancer because not all boullion list the ingredients.

These were really easy to make and the dogs seemed to like them, but I'm now slightly concerned after reading NICKELLAR's comments that cornmeal is not good for dogs!? Will need to look into it more...

These were great! I gave some to every dog owner I know and all the dogs loved them!  Since then, I've modified the recipe a little to help put weight on our Alaskan Malamute, Kody. (Poor guy was only 49lbs when we adopted him in April!)  I now add 1 scoop of protein shake mix, a couple tablespoons of peanut butter, a couple tablespoons of bacon grease, and a couple of cheap hot dogs cut up into small pieces. With the my modified version I also cut the corn meal in half and add a splash more milk when needed.  I quickly learned to freeze all but a dozen or so at a time after having a batch get moldy on me. Once frozen, they keep for months!

Dogs Love These! I got 3 different sized cut-outs from a craft store. Made all sizes and put into different clear gift-bags for Christmas. All the dogs loved them.. Also a cute and inexpensive Christmas idea!  ** The treats did get hard and dried-out fairly quickly.. I recommend making a smaller batch for just one dog or else giving some away

My 2 American Bulldogs absolutely love these treats! They disappear so quickly that I have to make 2 batches of them per week. It's a lot of work but I like knowing that their treats are tasty and contain only natural ingredients(I actually tasted them). I followed the recipe except I doubled the cheese. I plan to add bacon bits the next time I make them.

Dogs Love These! I made no changes to the recipe and have great success with the dough (still want to try the peanut butter sub for cheese/broth). I used a tiny 1" 'gingerbread man' cutter... cute! would also recommend leaving baked treats out to air dry for several hours and/or storing unsealed and/or refrigerating. so far have had no problems with any going bad and the nine dogs I have shared with absolutely love them! way tastier than store bought treats (I've tried!)

These might be too good. My dogs have been following me around the house since their first one. They nearly inhaled them. I used panko bread crumbs instead of the cornmeal since our pug has a finicky tummy. The dough was awesome. They smell great.

Buster & Maggie went nuts when they ate the first cookie, I did omit the cheese and cornmeal and added one cup of peanut butter, that's probably the reason Buster was hanging out in the kitchen till they were done.. I poked a hole using a straw in about 6 cookies to hang on the Christmas tree, probably not a real good idea but they are part of the family.. I even made a couple of treat bags for my friends pups as well..
thanks for sharing

I printed this recipe out quite a few months ago and finally got around to making these for my mother's very finicky poodle. She loved the raw dough, which we took as a good sign, but once baked and cooled, she's managed to eat only 2 of them and no more!  We gave my brother a bag of them to take home to his border collie and she LOVES them! So the next week, he came over again, so we decided to give him the rest of the treats, only to find MOLD had grown all over them! (I had put them on a shelf in a Tupperware container with her other treats). I wish I had went back and read the reviews again, because one person did suggest putting them in the refrigerator. So unfortunately most of them went to waste anyway. I won't give up though, I will find something this picky dog will eat! (and refrigerate it!  lol)

My dogs loved these treats. I made them just as the recipe calls but added extra cheese since I know my dogs love it. My dogs were pacing the kitchen and inhaled the treats after they cooled! Thank you for the recipe.

Wonderful! My dog LOVED the treats. I halved the recipe, and still ended up making 3 batches, but i doubt they'll go to waste since he's already eatin about 10 in the first day! if you have boullion cubes like I did instead of the granules, just boil the water then put the boullion cube in to dissolve. Thanks for the recipe! Next time I'll try the peanut butter.

My dogs loved these! This recipe is about the size of a standard cookie recipe, but that is a lot when you consider that your dogs will only eat 1-2 per day. I split the recipe and made half with peanut butter, as the other reviewers suggested, and half with chicken bullion. Both came out great. With these, it is a fine line between fully baked and burned, so be careful!

My dogs love these treats. I substituted corn muffin mix for the cornmeal, as someone else suggested.  I prefer making the 48 serving size and freezing the extra treats to keep them fresh. Thanks Donna for a great recipe!

This was very easy to make. I substituted corn muffin mix for the cornmeal and sugar because thats what I had on hand. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. They came out crunchy just like a store bought dog biscuit would. And the best part was that my dogs loved them!

I followed other users' advice and substituted peanut butter for the boullion and cheese. When I give my dog store-bought dog treats, he usually "buries" them (in the couch cushions!), but these, he eats immediately. He loves them and they're fun to make. I give them to friends who have dogs and they all love them also.

Went together really fast.  Other than soaking the oatmeal in the water with butter, I didn't separate any of the ingredients.  I through everything in the kitchen aid and mixed it all at once.  The dough was super easy to work with.  We have little (like 5 & 9 pound yorkies) so we used a cap to a steak sauce bottle as our cookie cutter.  We needed them really small and the cap made them about the size of a penny (perfect).  We used chicken instead of beef and I used quick oats.  Perfect!  We'll be making these for our dog friends next Christmas.  Thanks for the recipe.

Fantastic recipe. We made one batch following the directions (with cheese and beef) and another batch omitting those two ingredients and substituting with peanut butter. Our Scottie dog, Stewart, loved both equally and couldn't stop asking us for more. Thanks so much!

I liked these treats, and I will make them again! I am excited to try the chicken bouillon and peanut butter instead of beef. My only complaint...these are NOT EASY to make! They are inexpensive, and they make alot, and my dogs (Two 85 lb Boxers) LOVED them. These take a long time to roll out and cut, so be sure you have enough time to spend on them! I didnt have enough time, so I refrigerated half of the dough. The half that I cooked probably made 45-60 treats. I didnt use wheat flour, I just used regular all purpose unbleached flour and it worked great. I probably used about 1/4-1/2 cup extra. Give this recipe a try!

Easy, dog loved them. I did use 1 1/3c of beef broth and drippings(drained grease and juices from ground beef) instead of the water and margarine. Also added 1 clove minced garlic.

These were fun!  I made bone- and heart-shaped treats for my dog and her doggie cousin.  One quality that I really liked is that they were a little softer than the store-bought kind.  The dogs are little old ladies now (in their teens!) and their teeth are sensitive so this is something they can have to enjoy.  I think this would be a nice project for young cooks.  There's a little kneading (not the tiresome kneading that goes with homemade bread, for example) but there's some practice with working and "feeling" the dough.  And the other good point--I think it's wonderful to give kids an opportunity to do something special and teach kindness for four-legged friends who are dependent on THEM for love and attention.

I thought these were very easy to make and most of the ingredients I had on hand. I made them for my beagle's 1st birthday and she seems to enjoy them, as does my other dog. Will make them again for her 1st birthday in a couple of months. They hardened up really well and I also used a "bone" cookie cutter

I made these for my Aunt's dog, substituting peanut butter for the boullion and the cheese.  Unfortunately, my aunt's dog does not like peanut butter(?!),so she wouldn't touch these. My dogs, on the other hand, went nuts over them.Very easy to make, disappeared very quickly.

These were the perfect consistency for cookie cutters.  I did as one of the other raters suggestion and used peanut butter instead of the cheese and beef boullion.  Our 2 Labs love them! So that is what is important.  Thanks!

I made these treats for Christmas gift baggies for all my puppies friends!  It is a perfect healthy treat for those of us who like to make sure our dogs don't eat a lot of pre-packaged artificial treats.  I followed another reviewers advice and used Peanut Butter instead of the bouillon and cheese because my dog just loves peanut butter!  He almost does backflips to get one of these!

Made with peanut butter and  only had to bake for 20 minutes. Very EASY to make. We gave them to some friends that have a dog and they said they were a big hit. My 3 year old son said "it smells like dog food" when they were baking.

Made these for my yellow lab's (Sadie)
second birthday! I swear she knew these were for her as I was making them. She followed me to the kitchen to bake them and sat by the table waiting for them to cool! I, too substituted peanut butter for the cheese and she defintiely had a Happy Birthday! Will make these as gifts for Christmas for dog-friendly friends! Thanks for the recipe.

Great Fun!  Our dog loved these.  I had a little mini tugboat shape (was for playdoh) and used it to cut small tugboats out for our tiny Japanese Chin.  The dough was extremely easy to work with.  I'll try the peanut butter next time and see how she responds.
Thanks

These dog cookies were very easy.
My dogs, my families dogs, even my friends dogs went absolutely nuts over these! I have had to make these now 3 times! The last 2 times have had to be a double batch. I highly reccomend this wonderful recipe! 4 paws up our dogs say (their friends to)!

Wow! My dog is a very large newfoundland and a very picky eater, but he absolutely loves these! The first time I made them he came up to me and sniffed the unbaked dough, begging for a taste, so I gave him a little piece and he went crazy, sniffing the oven constantly until they were done. However, I have to keep them hidden because the (human) boys in the house are apparently equally fond. Now if only there was a way to add peanut butter to these...?

My dog loves these!  They're so easy to make.  The worst part is waiting such a long time for them to bake.  I've made up little gift bags and will be giving these to our dog friends as Christmas gifts!  I'll definitely make these again.

I just made these tonight for my neighbor's dog and took them over for him.  Let me tell you - Milo went crazy for these treats!  My neighbor said she had never seen him like that before!  He ate 2 of them, and then we had to put them up high out of doggie paw reach because he kept chewing on the bag trying to get more.  I will definitely make these again.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

My dog went CRAZY over these treats! I used chicken bouillon instead of the beef. I found a dog bone shaped cookie cutter. The recipe ended up making a lot more than I though it would, so I gave some to coworkers for their dogs and every dog really enjoyed the treats. Will make again!!

This is a great recipe!  I made it for the neighborhood dogs for Christmas.  I used mini cookie cutters in the shape of Christmas trees, stars, etc.  The dogs loved them and the "moms" asked for the recipe.  One dog sits all day in front of the table where the treats are kept.  Needless to say, his "mom" wanted the recipe, too.  Thanks Donna, I had a lot of fun with this recipe.

My Australian Shepherd loved these!  They are easy to make, and he actually prefers them to all other treats.  I made them for Christmas gifts to all our canine friends,I put them in decorative cellophane bags and put a really cute label on them with a digital picture of my dog on them, and I named them Buddy's Bodacious Bones!  Everyone was impressed! And their dogs loved them.  Only problem, Buddy is asking for more!

My dog loves these!  I followed another person's suggestion and substituted peanut butter for the corn meal.  The dough was great to work with and they are also popular with my friend's dog too.  Looking to try other variations using bacon grease to replace the margarine or sweet potato instead of corn meal.

I have made this recipe as is for years and it is by far the favorite treat for at least six of our dogs.
The only difference I see in this recipe is that directions say to cover.  They last just fine in a loose sieved crock without a top for at least a month.  Put a top on it and they mildew.

My boys only like savory treats, so I avoid the recipes with honey or apple sauce.  I immediately planned to skip the sugar in this one, not just because of my boys' preference but also because I don't feed them sugar.  As another reviewer suggested, I used 1.5 cups oats, olive oil instead of margarine, and for cheese I used 1 cup of grated parmesan.  I also diluted half a bouillon cube in the boiling water.  My boys seem to like these, and I ate a couple myself to see what they were like--they're not that different from people soft crackers, just a bit more bland.  I'll make these again, but I'll double up on the parmesan.

Easiest cookie dough I’ve ever worked with!  I used 1 cup of natural creamy peanut butter instead of cheese and cornmeal.  Also replaced white sugar with 1 tablespoon of honey.  I only have white flour so I used that.  When I can get to the store will buy some oat flour or rice flour to see how it works out.  The dough rolls out beautifully and holds the shape of the cookie cutter.  I don’t have real cookie cutters so I used a shot glass for smaller treats and a biscuit cutter for larger treats.  I love this recipe and will absolutely make it again for my three dogs!

I've made tons of dog biscuits and these are now one of my new favorites!  So easy to make and can easily make substitutions.  I made one batch with 1/2 cup of peanut butter (instead of cheese) and 2/3 cup of coconut flour (instead of cornmeal).  For the cheese recipe, I substituted 2/3 cup of coconut flour for cornmeal and 4 tbsp of beef broth instead of beef bouillon cubes.  They were the perfect consistency to roll and cut.

Made theses last week.  My two boys really love them. Normally I follow new recipes to the tee, but decided to omit the corn meal and just added more oats.  Did add fresh parsley; (one of my plants needed pruning), plus good for the boys.   Was lazy and rolled them out, cut into strips, giving them a good twist then baked the full time. Got exactly 50 cookies.  Put some after cooling in a qt. zip bag for the pantry, put the rest in a gallon zip bag which went into the frig.  I tried one my self and they are really really good!  They are like cheese sticks only much better for you; and more yummy. Thank you for sharing your recipe.

I have made these many times, but omit the cornmeal. I add extra oats and always add finely chopped moose pepperoni for the added taste. I also grind up and add Glucosamine for added bone and tooth health.  Oh, I forgot to mention that for shelf life, I always just put a hand full into the jar at a time, the rest I freeze. Keeps every treat fresh and tasty.

My dog loves these.  I used liquid beef bouillon as that is what I had.  I also used a cookie cutter in the shape of a cat - that's probably why she loves them so much!   I did take other reviewers advice and froze half, keep some in the fridge and some in the treat bucket.  Will make again.

I made these for our dog and three other families with dogs and everyone was thrilled with them. I found the recipe to be easy to follow and make. My only fault is they got mold on them so I would recommend refrigerating if you still have some after 10 days.

My dog loves these.  I omitted the sugar (these are DOG biscuits!) and the corn meal (filler).  Added extra 1 c of oats to make up for the corn meal.

I followed one reviewers advice and went for sweet instead of savory, using peanut butter and Karob chips instead of beef and cheddar. I didn't roll and cut shapes, just made little balls. This recipe makes a zillion cookies so I baked 12 and then put three small unbaked batches of dough in the freezer for later. My dog, who is a total doggy-chocolate fiend, gobbled them down. I'll try the savory version the next time I have beef bullion in the house!

One dog LOVED them but another didn't. The one that didn't like them was a puppy and maybe hadn't developed taste buds for cheese and beef. I substituted oatmeal and flour for the cornmeal.  Very easy. I did it all by hand and the dough was easy to work through with flour until it wasn't sticky.

I make these but I sub peanut butter for the margarine and 1/2 cup ground flax for the cornmeal.  I add a bit extra oats or flour to compensate.  I leave out the sugar and use half broth and half milk instead of bullion. I have not found a dog that didn't lover these. I make both large and small bone shapes and freeze half and keep the rest in the fridge.

I hit in my house.  I did make a few changes after reading several reviews.  I used 4 pkg. of Maple and Brown Sugar Oatmeal (that is what I had).  Also, I used 1/3 c. creamy peanut butter and 1/2 c. beef broth and 1 egg.  Added 3 1/2 c - 3 2/3 c. all-purpose flour (until consistency looks like a cookie dough).  Used a small melon scooper and pressed into 1/2" cookies.  Bake at 350 degrees for about 20 min.

This is an excellent basic recipe. I eliminated the sugar and the butter. Add 1/3 c up olive oil. Add 2 small jars "baby beef" and substitute unsalted beef broth for the water and beef bullion. I just dropped them on a cookie sheet and pressed them down a bit with a fork. ... saves time. Baked for 10 minutes. They do stick a bit so best to use parchment or aluminum foil on your cookie sheet.  She loves them! Next time I'm also going to add a bit of cooked carrot.

Utterly  fabulous! Zoe loved them and pleaded for more. I did swap out the cornmeal, sugar and bouillon and added 1 cup of peanut butter, a little honey and a bit more whole wheat flour as someone else suggested. I sprinkled a little cheddar cheese not a whole cup. Someone also suggested rolling the dough into a log and freezing it and then cutting into circles. Worked like a charm. This is a winner!

Made this 2x now and will be my go to recipe. I substituted peanut butter for the cheese but otherwise followed the recipe and it turned out perfectly. The dough is easy to work with and it makes a large batch. Keep them in the freezer, the dogs don't mind eating them frozen and they keep longer.

Personally, I didn't like them. They were too bland for my taste. 

My dog, however, LOVES THEM. Like other reviews said, the dough was quite sticky, but simply adding a bit of flour to the dough as it is being kneaded was a quick fix. I will definitely be making these again for my dog.

This is my go to for sure! Simple, easy as written and my lab, cocker, and beagle  love them! We had an informal Thanksgiving with friends a few days ago. I had way to much turkey and dressing, gravy, green beans, etc.... left over. After we couldn't eat any more left overs, out came this recipie. I made it per written directions, added 3 cups chopped turkey, used the gravy in place of butter and bullion cubes, threw in the dressing and green bean casserole, added the carrot and celery from the relish tray, and finally some left over organic  cranberries in place of the sugar. I added an extra egg because of more ingredients, cut the corn meal, and VIOLA!! My dogs are in heaven.  Do note though, because of health issues of my husband, all ingredients I cook with are organic and pure vegi  based, so NO salt ever. Just wanted to share a great idea of turning leftovers into a wonderful treat for our 4 legged friends. Thanks for a great base recipie!! Even my cats loved this!

Seriously have the pickiest dog on the planet who has turned up his nose at steak!  So with trepidation I tried these.  I did replace the margarine with bacon fat and the milk with chicken broth. Excellent consistency as a dough, using about 2 out of the three cups of wheat flour.  And the next time I replaced the cornmeal with potato starch instead. Worked wonderfully!

I made it first with cheddar cheese, and it was a great success. Of course the dog loved it! I used oil instead of margarine. The second time I made it I substituted a cup of peanut butter for the cheese. She loved that too! I skipped the sugar both times, figuring a dog did not need sugar. With the peanut butter version I also added 3 tablespoons of dried milk powder to boost the protein.

I made these treats for my dogs and they go crazy for them! I also made some for my friends' dogs and they ask me to make them more! If you have a smaller dog, use a pen cap to cut the treats out and bake them for about twenty minutes. And remember to keep the treats in the fridge to last longer!

Our dog eats 2 of these for his breakfast every day. I have occasionally used peanut butter instead of cheese and they are great (you may have to add a bit more flour in this case). I eat one occasionally as they taste that good!

I substituted sugar for applesauce (more healthy) and used 1 cup of peanut butter instead of cheese & bouillon. It made 169 small/med size biscuits - fab! My puppy loved it immediately! Thank you!

Great basic recipe.  I don't think you can mess this up.  I read the reviews and made some recommended substitutions... Left out cornmeal, milk and cheese, added olive oil, peanut butter, apple sauce and extra oats.  I just added flour until I got the right consistency. Both of my dogs loved these treats.

Good recipe, omitted corn meal, cut into bone shapes!  My daughter enjoyed making this for our pug's birthday! Kept in an airtight container but they still grew mold after 3 days.  Our dog would do ANYTHING to get one of these treats, so let's just say they were a hit.  However, she is a pug!!

My Blue Heeler will not eat store bought dog biscuits since I first made these for her, and her doggie friends are becoming as fussy as her  they certainly don't get time to go stale in this house.   She haunts the oven until they come out.

VERY easy to make and the dogs seem to like it. I make it in BIG batches to give out to my clients for Christmas (I am a dog groomer) and the dogs seem to really enjoy it. It makes nice crisp biscuits.

Just made my first batch! I did change a few things after reading through a few others posts. I ommited the cornmeal and instead just added a little more oats. I also used a chicken boulion and about a 1/2 cup of peanut butter. I just gave my dog one and he loved it!! 
Made these has Christmas gifts for family pets! We will see if everyone else loves them! 

Thank you for the recipe!!

My Dogs really love these treats and they will not eat milky bones. They hang near the oven while they cook.
I did not have cheddar cheese so I used parmesan/romano - and I had to use extra flour b/c dough was so sticky. Then rolled out nice!

Dog loved these. I used chicken bouillon instead of beef. Also added some parmesan cheese with the cheddar. The dough was really easy to work with and make cut-out shapes.

This is a great recipe, both of my bulldogs love them!
I omitted the sugar, cornmeal and but in about 1/2 tsp of boulion, i also sprinkled about 1/2 tsp of grated parmesan in.
The kept ok in airtight container and zip lock bags.
Thanks for the recipe!

A great and easy recipe to follow! I made a batch of both the cheey-beef and peanut butter versions to gift to my puppy-lovin' friends for the holidays. I haven't heard the reviews back from my canine friends, yet, but I'm expecting only good feedback.

My dog and cat both love them.  My dog especially - I keep them in the refrigerator to better preserve their shelf life, and she now stands by the fridge when it's treat time.  I made two different sizes - a larger biscuit shaped treat and some smaller bite sized treats - more less to use up the extra dough and fit more on the cookie sheets.

My dog loved these treats! This recipe made MANY individual treats...I would say about 60 or so. I used a 1 1/2 inch diameter cookie cutter. Will definitely make again!

This recipe was awesome!  My dog loved them.  But I had to bake them in the oven a little longer.  They seemed to be a bit chewy when baking for the recommended time.

I must say that my dog loved these, but the neighbor dogs did not.  However, I didn't follow the recipe exactly.  I used someone's tip and substituted peanut butter for the milk.  I had to cook them longer than suggested - don't know if my cookie cutters were too big or what happened?  I also substituted beef soup base for the bouillion cubes.  All said and done, I will make them again - but my dog will be stingy and won't be sharing with her picky old friends!

These were fabulous!  Just a warning though I could not get my dogs to eat the store bought treats for quite a while after feeding them these.  They absolutely loved them.  I made them exactly as written and the dogs devoured them every time they were given a treat.  Will continue to make these as often as possible.

These cookies are SUPER! I did substitute the bullion and cheese for peanut butter. My poochy's LOVE,LOVE,LOVE them, not to mention the neighbors dogs and co-workers dogs. It really is a fun and easy recipe to use. The smell of the biscuts baking permiates around the house. They keep well also. If I make a big batch I put some in freezer bags and put in freezer.

This was my first time making any kind of homemade treats for my dogs, and it was easy! I used beef broth instead of boiling water, and combined all the ingredients except the cheese. I then cut the batter in half and added 1/2 cup cheddar/edam to half the mix and 1/2 cup peanut butter to the other half. The recipe makes tons of treats, 4 cookie sheets filled to the brim! And even my senile dog came out of the woodworks when she smelled them baking. I have a chihuahua (very picky eater, only eats when no one is looking, weird, yes), a german shepard, and a pitbull and they all devoured them in no time. I made all shapes and sizes, and I even had one myself, not bad but not good either, but thats why they are dog treats! Also, a little brush of honey goes a long way.

I followed some of the other reviewers' advice and substituted the beef buillon and cheese for 1 cup of peanut butter.  I also substituted boiling chicken broth for the water.  I made these for Christmas gifts from my pup to his doggie friends - every single dog (of all shapes and sizes!) loved these!  I couldn't find small cookie cutters, so I just rolled out the dough and cut the treats into different sized rectangles.  I also turned these halfway through baking.  Wonderful recipe!

These came out just as I hoped they would: crunchy and smelly (dogs love smelly treats!). I substituted beef bullion with chicken, and didn't add sugar. I even tasted them myself -- they were pretty good! I'm giving them to my mother's dog's tomorrow, so we'll see what they think of them!

Alright, I have to admit, when I finished baking these, I was curious, so I tasted them.  To me, they were really bland and I thought there would be no way my dogs would want them.  Turns out, I was wrong.  Both of my dogs as well as my mom's dog gobbeled them right up and showed me all their tricks trying to get more.  I did have to change out a few ingredients because one of my dogs has food allergies, but I followed the basic recipe.  Let's hope they still like them at the end of the batch - this makes a lot.

This was a great treat for the four-legged family members for Thanksgiving.  I substituted 1 cup of peanut butter for the bullion and topped it with vanilla icing. Also they are great for hiding pills in for finicky eaters.

I made these treats along with my holiday baking so all the doggies could have thier x-mas cookies too! I cut them out in little Christmas trees.  Anyhow my dog absolutely loved them he laid down with it and lick it for a few minutes to savor it then scarf it down.  Big hit! Now he runs them out side so we can't take it back?

It felt like a lot of work, but my dogs really appreciated it!  They gobbled them up :)
I think this year I will make them for my neighbors pets and give them with the bread I normally bake at Christmas.

Thanks so much for such a great dog treat! My Toy American Eskimo, Scout, loved them! We also shared them with our other two dogs, and they loved them too. I also tried one, and they were pretty good.

These are easy and dogs love them.  I make large bones and dip in puppy frosting and tie with a ribbon for friends large dogs birthday, or I made lots of little ones for another friends' small dog in a cute container.  The best part, my dog gets the 'extras' and is in doggy heaven!

My Scottish Terrier loves these.  I cut them out with a Scottie shaped cookie cutter.  It seemed to take much longer to prepare but maybe because I used such a small cookie cutter.

Our dogs Charly (picky)and Heidi(glutton) both approve!  Had to knead in 1/2 cup more flour so that the dough was less sticky.  Used mini heart and star cookie cutters and they came out better looking than store-bought dog treats.  Thank you Donna!

Very easy to mix together and the dough is great to roll and cut out. I made a batch last night for our relatives dogs and today I am planning on making more for our dog for christmas. Great recipe!

I don't think my puppy was too sure about these treats at first, but she does eat them. She always plays with them first, but she does that with all her treats. Not bad, but its not really worth the work when she's just as happy with store-bought.
