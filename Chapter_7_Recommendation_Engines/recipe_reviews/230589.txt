This was very different and very good - once some critical changes in measurements were made, at least to please Hubs and me. After decades of meatloaf making :) you grow to recognize how much wet and how much dry ingredients you'll need.  The half cup of bread crumbs was just fine (up to 2/3 cup would have been okay), but two eggs and a half cup of barbecue sauce (or milk, or ketchup, or whatever wet ingredient you choose to use) is an amount better suited for two pounds of meat, not one! Also, Worcestershire sauce has a distinct flavor and shouldn't be overdone - half the amount was just right for our tastes - 1-1/2 tsp.  I skipped the optional chili powder because I was so enthusiastic about the flavors of BBQ sauce, oregano and Dijon - not to mention the bacon! - and I felt the chili powder would be an unneccessary distraction rather than a positive contribution.  I used a meatloaf mix (beef, veal, pork) and added some chopped celery along with the onion - and of course I seasoned this well with salt and pepper. The bottom line is that this was darned good, an interesting change from the usual meatloaf.

Good recipe with a few changes.  I have a big family so I used 2 1/2 pounds of meat, used ketchup and BBQ sauce in the meatloaf and also about a tablespoon of hot sauce and omitted the chili powder.  I added green pepper to the onion/garlic saute. After wrapping with the bacon I made a topping mixture of BBQ sauce, ketchup, honey and Brown sugar which I rubbed over the top before baking.  Turned out awesome.  I would have given this 5 stars but you needed some tweeks to make it a really great meatloaf.

This had a good flavor, but it was way too wet to form into a log.  I suggest cutting the egg to one and the bbq sauce to 1/4 cup, or add it little by little.  I used 1/2 cup bread crumbs as the recipe said, so maybe more bread would help also. I also cooked the back a little longer before I used it.  Not sure if I'll make this again.

You don't need to form  log if you use loaf pan.  The wetness described will cook away by adding 10-15 minutes and be really moist. Dryness is biggest complaint of meatloaf. I add cheddar cheese down middle.  the best meatloaf I ever ate was cooked in electric skillet if you have one.

Definate Keeper!! My family still talks about this recipe & I made it weeks ago. I did modify the recipe taking into consideration several of the comments regarding the actual meatloaf recipe. I did use the baking suggestion listed on another site as well. (With a foil lined cookie sheet underneath I placed foil on a wire rack with a few holes in it to allow the grease to drain. This made cleanup very easy. ) My family LOVED it!! I didn't even get a chance to take a photo it was gone so fast. With some cream cheese mashed potatoes it was definitely cheat night done right IMO!

I made this today instead of turkey for a holiday dinner. It tasted great,  and was extremely moist. I took other reviewers comments into consideration and tweaked the ingredients a bit. 

I wanted to make more than one loaf, so doubled the meat and used about 2lbs of lean ground beef, 1 cup of bread crumbs, a green bell pepper suated in with my onion, 1/2 cup BBQ sauce, and only one egg. I thought it would still be too wet, but it worked out fine. 

My glaze was BBQ sauce, ketchup, and a lil bit of brown sugar.  I thought by making 2lbs we'd have a decent amount of leftovers, but everyone enjoyed it so much and had seconds!

I didnt use a loaf pan. Instead I shaped my loafs in a plastic wrapped loaf pan, turned it out on to a wire a sheet pan, and baked it on an aluminim lined baking sheet, so the fat dripped away, and it was easier to baste.

Thanks for the recipe. It was easy to make,  and just needed a few tiny tweaks. Most moist meatloaf I've ever had!  :)

This has got to be the best meatloaf I have ever eaten. My family LOVES it. I added the chili powder, just the right spice to add a little kick.

Very tasty and moist! I followed the other reviewers and cut down to 1 egg. I also mixed a little ketchup, BBQ sauce and brown sugar together and used it as glaze for the top. My boyfriend couldn't get enough of it! Would definitely make this again.

The flavor was good, but I would use 1.5-2 lbs of ground beef, leaving all other ingredients the same.

My kids (picky) loved it!  I thought it was a little mushy and will probably add a palmful of oatmeal the next time.

This is my favorite recipe. I have made it twice. I prefer the onions carmelized for a sweeter taste of onion. I have also used both chili and cajun spice and equally good. I make it with 1-1/2 lb. meat and one full sleeve of saltine crackers. I line a loaf pan with plastic wrap, place the bacon across the pan overhanging the sides, fill with meat mixture, pull the ends of bacon together, then turn onto broiler pan to bake and the plastic wrap lets it fall out of loaf pan easily.

This recipe was delicious after reading the reviews and learning most people found it to be to moist I just added a couple extra handful of crispy panko bread crumbs. My hubby really liked it I will deffinately be making this again but next time I won't forget the chili powder though it is nice and sweet without it.

I made it with the bacon cut into slices and sauteed, then mixed into the loaf.
FYI more eggs make it set, on account of the eggs cook, so those with a wet loaf may want to add more breadcrumbs.'
I'm an Aussie, so meatloaf has always been a challenge for me, but this one came out allright with one egg to 1&1/2 lbs of beef.
I used chipotle BBQ sauce for added flavour and added some honey to the glaze ib the last ten minutes.
best Meatloaf I've made so far.

Very tasteful and full of flavor but definitely need to cut down the wet ingredients and I would double the bread crumbs. But very delicious and I will be making it again

I made this for 2 bacon lovers. They thought it was awesome! I am just not a big fan of meatloaf. However, I really enjoyed making the recipe and will change up some of the ingredients next time. More garlic!

I've never been a fan of meatloaf no matter how it's made. This was my first time ever attempting to make a meatloaf and I was pleasantly surprised. I used 1 cup of breadcrumbs and 1 egg based on other comments. I didn't cook the bacon before hand. I laid the raw bacon strips on a loaf pan draped over the sides, filled with my meat mixture and then folded them back over the top. I then flipped it out onto a foil lined cookie sheet with a metal rack on top so the grease would drop off. Coated the top with a bbq sauce, ketchup, brown sugar, and honey mixture. Yum! I went back for seconds and will be making this again. Hubby didn't like the texture so much. He said it reminded him of stuffing so I may try with less breadcrumbs for him next time. Flavor was awesome!

I made the recipe exactly as stated, and like others, I found it a little wet. The flavors were great; the only downside for me was that the bacon didn't become crisp-- as the photo seems to indicate. I'm going to make this again, reducing the BBQ sauce, and see if that helps...

I  liked the BBQ twist on a family favorite.  I have to double everything for my family  and increased the time to 1hr before applying the barbecue sauce on top and changed the temperature to 350.  I think when I make it again, I will add a few more breadcrumbs or one less egg as it was a bit softer than our usual meatloaf consistency.  Tasty though!

It was nice a moist and flavorful. I used a meatloaf mixture of veal,Hamburg and pork. I also only added one egg and 1/4 cup of bbq sauce. Was easy to make a yummy.

I used a mixture of ground pork and ground beef. I am not a fan of Worcestershire so I omitted it. Instead of bread crumbs I used saltines and just used 1 egg after reading a few comments about the wet ingredients being "off".  My loaf shaped very easily and stayed together on my pan.  It took just over an hour to cook but I used more meat than what the recipe states so that was to be expected.  I added a tablespoon of brown sugar to the barbecue sauce that I basted the bacon with and the flavour it gave the meatloaf was SO good! I know i changed quite a few things but the concept is fantastic and will be my "go-to" meatloaf recipe.

Great recipe, I used 1/4 cup of barbecue and 1 egg so it wouldn't be as wet.  It was easy to make and the hubby loved it!

tis is a great recipe, I used the one egg as suggested and crackers unstead of bread crumbs. also I did not have garlic so I used garlic powder to desired amount. I also took the advice of "cbean" and made the glaze of brown shugar and BBQ sause and a small amount of ketchup.
turned out amazing and my boyfriend even ate it...and he hates meatloaf! -Rebbecca

I enjoyed the change of flavor for meatloaf. It was very tasty, however I'm  glad I followed naples review..it would have been way too wet if I hadn't.
