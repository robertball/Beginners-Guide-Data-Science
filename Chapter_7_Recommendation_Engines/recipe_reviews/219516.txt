These browned up nicely, had good flavor, but there was one major problem...they were soggy on the bottom.  I expected to eat this with my hands (like you would with a turnover) but ended up eating it with a knife & fork.  It was so wet on the bottom that it was falling apart when I was trying to get it off the baking sheet.  Could be the meat released a little liquid, but more likely, it was the pickle slice juice.  You may be able to avoid the sogginess issue just by shoving the pickle in AFTER it has baked.  Dill pickles are an essential ingredient on a Cuban, so you do need them.  Whatever, it was a disappointment.  I think I'll stick to making my Cuban panini-style.
