I was looking for a white barbeque sauce after I watched food network and the travel channel and saw southern barbeque joints using it. I made as listed exactly. I didn't get an overpowering vinegar taste and everyone loved it. I used it basting chicken leg quarters in the oven and the grill. We also used a little as a dipping sauce. Creamy, garlicky with a little tang. Loved it!

Tasted way too much like vinegar, yet the garlic and horseradish flavors were entirely lost.  It's not too versatile as a BBQ sauce if it isn't "meant to get to a very hot temp for a vey long time."  I just used it as a side/dipping sauce, but because of the overpowering vinegar, it was not a hit.  Sorry.

LOVED this bbq sauce.  We had never had a white bbq sauce before, and we really liked this one.  We had 'Hamburgers - It's in the Bun' from AR and I cut this recipe back to two servings and tried the recipe with the burgers.  We really enjoyed it and I can't wait to try it on pulled pork.

Cooked pork ribs and used this sauce on them. They turned out great, let it set for a few hours to let the taste mingle.

This is a great white sauce - good spicy kick. I used coarsely ground pepper that added a bit of a crunch. Will probably use a finer grind next time. We really like vinegar and horseradish so this fit the bill. Great recipe.

I made this for smoked chicken- it was really good! My husband said it was ok for something different. I would add this in as an alternative to the regular tomato based bbq sauce or vinegar based sauce. They are all good- just all very different from one another, although this is pretty close to the Vinegar based 'Cornell' like marinades. For great results- pull off grill a few minutes before done and tent in foil for 10 minutes- super juicy!
