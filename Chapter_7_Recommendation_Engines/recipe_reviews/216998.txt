This tastes wonderful. Loved the ginger and asparagus in it. One suggestion, since the shrimp should only be cooked for a short time, saute them separately and add after adding the quinoa. I found it difficult to cook the shrimp evenly with all the other ingredients. The added reward - it is very healthy too! Thanks Diego782.

This is a terrific recipe: beautifully colored, easy, and healthy (with one small change).  Like another reviewer, we only used half of the shrimp required and it was still more than enough-I was thrilled because it made the recipe healthier and more economical.  I also omitted the raisins because my kids dislike "cooked raisins', but I'd like to try an adult version some time that had the raisins and some extra heat (I was thinking sweet chile sauce).  This is going to become part of my regular rotation!

OMG!!
I made this for dinner.  My husband loved it as well as I.  The quinoa, shrimp and veggies mixed beautifully and the ginger and lemon set it off.
I will make this again and again.  Didn't have to add anything extra.

I'm on the hunt lately for quinoa recipes and since I have about 5 bags of shrimp from a recent sale I thought I'd give this one a try.  Verdict:  yummy!  I made it exactly as written except for omitting the raisins because I don't like them.  Very easy to make, healthy and delicious.  Next time I'll add an extra tablespoon of lemon juice to brighten the flavours up even more.  My husband suggested adding a bit of chopped jalapeno (he loves the Szechwan Shrimp from this site) but he likes a lot of heat in his food.  Thanks for a great recipe I'll make often!

My husband and I LOVED this dish!  We threw sambal oelek (vietnamese chili paste) into the oil to give it a little kick otherwise, the flavors were simple but delicious.  We also used only a 1/2lb of small shrimp and found it to be enough.

This was wonderful!  It was my first time using quinoa and I couldn't have been happier with the results.  I didn't have asparagus so I used green beans and left out the raisins since hubby doesn't like them.  Wonderful recipe and very easy.

Great recipe! I changed it up a bit since I didn't have some of the ingredients and I also used red quinoa to add color! Try cooking your veggies in white wine and then at the very end put in freshly chopped basil! Yum!

I was in an adventerous mood this weekend, so I made a couple of recipes that include some ingredients that I'm not too crazy about, including red peppers and raisins.  Since the only meat I eat is fish, I used "Not Chicken" vegetarian broth.  I also added some water chestnuts I needed to use.  It was really delicious.  I don't recommend omitting the raisins.  They add a tiny bit of sweetness that the dish needs.  Yummy!

This was really good with some revisions.  I omitted the raisins and red bell pepper and replaced green beans for the asparagus.  This lacked a little flavor so I added a few spashes of soy sauce and some additional seasoning.

This is a great meal in one dish.  I didn't change anything.  I was dubious about using raisins, but I will never leave them out!  They added a perfect combination of sweet with the tangy of the lemon.  You could put any vegetables in this and it'd be great.  Using the chicken broth with cooking the quinoa is a must.

We really enjoy this recipe and it has become a family favourite.  I tried adding about a teaspoon and a half of curry powder and instead of raisin I used dried cranberries.  They added a very nice flavour to the dish.  I found that the 1 tablespoon of lime juice just wasn't enough for our liking so I added an additional 1 tablespoon and found that it was just perfect.  I have made the recipe with the shrimp but the second time I decided to replace it with about a half pound of chicken breast.  Definitely a keeper!

Excellent! I just started actually cooking and getting away from frozen dinners and this was an incredibly easy and tasty recipe! Can't wait to make it again! Also, I am a shrimp lover so the whole pound was a good amount!

I followed many reviewers suggestions to double the lemon juice and halve the shrimp.  My conclusion?  Too much lemon and too few shrimp!  Maybe I'll try this recipe as the original submitter published.  I think the changes back will make us like this more.

I liked it decently enough, but my husband didn't really like it.  He said it didn't have enough flavor (which I do agree, maybe some extra spice or something if I do again), and although he didn't admit, I think it was because it was the first time he'd ever had quinoa and his palate just didn't like it much.

DELICIOUS!!!  Definately a "DO-AGAIN".  Left out the raisins (cause I can't stand them) and it was terrific.  My husband and son both liked it too.

Fantastic one-dish meal that is both healthy and tasty.  The amount of quinoa was perfect as my family doesn't love it, but there were plenty of shrimp and veggies in there.  My only changes were to omit the raisins, increase the broth (I used veggie broth) to 2 cups.  Mine was a bit on the salty side so I will try reduced-sodium broth next time I make it.

I love one dish meals and this was my 3rd time cooking with quinoa. I liked the sound of asparagus, shrimp and garlic so i thought i would give this a try. I omitted the raisins and mushrooms because i am not a fan of them.  I also increased the garlic.  A serving for 4 calls for 1.5 cups of broth, and I wound up using 2 cups in the end.  I also seasoned further with garlic powder (i love garlic) and onion powder, plus a pinch of Vegeta.  Definitely a good recipe that can be tweaked to your liking!  Try it!

I cooked my quinoa in chicken broth to add a subtle flavor and used a red bellpepper to bring a little sweetness and color to the dish. I omitted the parsley/cilantro this time so as to have the asparagus and shrimp flavors at the head of the line. To the plate, I added some Peruvian Aji sauce (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/peruvian-aji-sauce/detail.aspx) as a side dressing. Wooooooo, Buddy! This was the absolute best quinoa I've ever made. It was an "Out of This World Meal" which earned me the prized and golden Stamp of Approval (SOA) from Mi Gato Loco.

Tried this tonight. Replaced asparagus with broccoli, no mushrooms. I added  teriyaki sauce. Otherwise, it was a tasty, light dish with lots of flavor. Husband cut veggies while I started quinoa, only took 20 minutes & we were sitting down to dinner. I used frozen, thawed pre-cooked shrimp. I will definitely serve again.

Since my husband and I have started eating healthy, it's been difficult to find easy, decent recipes that we can make.  So, this was a nice surprise.  I did not have asparagus or mushrooms, so I used zucchini instead.  The raisins, according to my mom who tried it, are not necessary.  I don't like raisins, so I picked them out.  Altogether, a good, heathy, and easy recipe!

I added a little lemongrass & garlic powder. Also I boiled/cooked the shrimp in 1 1/2 cups of water and used that instead of the chicken broth (I didn't have any broth on hand). Came out delicious ;)

Agree this needed a little extra lemon juice and some soy sauce to give it a little more flavor. But thought it was a great quick and healthy meal!

This is a great dish and easily adaptable to the items you have on hand.  The only changes I made were dried cranberries instead of raisins and lime juice instead of lemon because it's what I had.  The only thing I would do differently next time is use more of the raisins or cranberries, probably 1/2 cup.  Thank you for a great recipe that I will make often!

Wonderful!  Very easy and adaptable to your tastes - I left out the mushrooms and raisins.  I almost omitted the ginger too, and boy am I glad I didn't!  Such a great ingredient and it really gives this dish a fresh Asian flair!  In this recipe, and all that call for fresh lemon juice, I always take the extra step to add the zest of lemon I use - it made a great flavor impact here!

I left out the raisins and ginger, which may have added quite a bit of flavor.  This was good, but not enough flavor to be great.

Really great....love quinoa so this was going to be a winner. I did omit the ginger and raisins since I had none. Nice, light and healthy. Served with a tossed salad. Yummy meatless Friday dinner and thanks!

I substituted green beans for asparagus as others did. I also omitted the raisins. I added 1 Tbsp lemon juice to the quinoa as it cooked. I sauteed the shrimp separately in 1 Tbsp lemon juice. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. Note: This triples the lemon juice. It still feels like there was some herb or spice missing. It was ok, but if this missing link is found it could be awesome. Seems like a good base. I tried separately cinnamon, ground red pepper and cumin on spoonfuls. None of these worked.

I tend to cook with what's on hand so I made a couple modifications to this one that didn't ruin it.  First I used a cup or more of finely chopped kale instead of the bell pepper, and I omitted the mushrooms because Momma hates those.  Also, I used jumbo shrimp because that's what we had in the freezer, but I don't recommend it.  Their sheer size made them seem bland compared to the rest of the dish.  Adding a bit of soy sauce after cooking saved me from my mistake, but I'll use smaller shrimp next time.

This was absolutely delicious! I doubled the ingredient amounts to have leftovers and added some sauteed spinach leaves and added fresh cilantro at the very end. I didn't have any raisins, but I had dried cranberries, so used those instead and was probably just as good. The whole thing took me about 45 min to prepare start to finish. This is a super easy dish to make if your having people over for a casual dinner, and is likely very good with chicken or as a vegetarian dish as well. I agree with another reviewer to make the shrimp separately when the rest is done and just add it to the mix since shrimp is done quickly. Will definitely make again!

Really good recipe. I double the recipe and did 1/2 shrimp (followed this recipe) and also mixed in 1/2  diced and sautéed grilled chicken breast chunks. I also doubled the asparagus and added 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper for a very mild kick. . I omitted the raisins as I don't care for them.  Cold added to a green salad should be good...I'll definatley make again.

Very good and healthy! We added cilantro and Siracha and it made it EVEN better. We also cooked the shrimp after the veggies to make sure they cooked more evenly and sautéed not just steamed. We also tried some bites without the Siracha and had it with soy sauce which makes it taste like a whole other stir fry type of dish and good as well.

Very quick and easy to make.  I really liked this one.  The ginger gave it a very "stir fry" feel, and the shrimp and quinoa made it a lighter option.

The raisins were an interesting add, I definitely recommend keeping them in there. I added more asparagus, out of personal preference, and that seemed to be the only issue I had when making the dish, making sure the asparagus was done.

This dish is fantastic! Tested it on my Sister and her family. Followed the recipe exactly as indicated. I was a bit worried about the raisins. My 11 year old nephew doesn't like veggies or cooked raisins, but told him that if he eats everything all together, the flavors in his mouth would be so tasty. Told him to just try it and he actually loved it!  Ate his whole plate and asked for more.  So, for those mom's out there whose kids don't like cooked raisins or veggies, just have them try it.  They might surprise you. Great dish; will be making for my husband tonight.

Seriously delicious. You'd pay loads for this at a restaurant. I added some extra garlic and lemon juice and my boyfriend sprinkled some red pepper flakes on it at the table. Very good and very filling!

Made it the way instructed, except for 3 things: I used ground ginger, no raisins because I don't like them, and cooked the quinoa in a rice cooker with 1c quinoa and 2c broth.  I didn't care for the lemon flavor or the other flavor...assuming ginger.  Maybe fresh ginger would make a world of difference?

I doubled the amount of lemon juice and cooked the veggies and shrimp in white wine. I also added some parsley. The family loved it!!

Great dish. Did not change anything but next time I might add some chilli flakes for some heat.

I made the following changes and give this recipe 5 stars. Increase chicken broth to 1 3/4 cup, use dried cranberries instead of raisins, increase fresh ginger to 2 T, and increase lemon juice to 2 T. Yum!

Very good recipe. Beautiful colors, great taste, and healthy besides!
 
If you don't like raisins, you might try dried cherries, cranberries, or some other sweet/tart dried fruit. It really adds good flavor to this dish.

I added a dash of red pepper flakes for spice, and I used more  veggie broth instead of chicken and tossed in more veggies than recipe. It still seemed like a lot of shrimp to me, but my husband loved it.
Next time, even more veggies and quinoa.

Thanks for the recipe!

Thought my kids would hate this. One doesn't like asparagus and both dislike red peppers, not to mention that they aren't crazy about shrimp. But both absolutely loved it and are waiting for leftovers.

Needs more flavour - more vegetables, less quinoa

Wonderful colorful dish - doubled the ginger & lemon - otherwise as directed - can easily be adapted to veggies on hand.

A very colourful dish but it needs more flavour.  I used some chilli garlic sauce which helped a lot.

This recipe as is, is excellent. I love the flavorful combination of textures and ingredients. I'm not a fan of raisins at all, but used them, despite my aversion, and ended up loving the final product. Adding a pinch of curry is also tasty.

My whole family enjoyed the recipe including the kids! This will become a regular dish at our house! We used 2lbs of shrimp, extra mushrooms and asparagus, and the rest of the ingredients as given. I never would have thought I'd like the raisins, but they were great in this dish! Very healthy and a delicious flavor over all.

Delicious!! Like other viewers, I added more garlic. Think I'd add the same veggies, only slightly more of them. I used frozen cooked shrimp and it was fine. Otherwise perfect!! Thanks for the recipe.
