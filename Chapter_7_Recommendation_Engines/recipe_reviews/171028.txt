Well, it's lacking a lot. Be sure to buy the albacore tuna. The cheaper tuna is impossible to get dry enough! The rice vinegar also makes it too wet. I would suggest using Miracle Whip for the tang instead of mayo And vinegar. I tasted after following the recipe then doubled everything except the tuna and mayo/vinegar. Then I added celery, salt, pepper, garlic powder. I served it with sliced tomato and lettuce leaves and cheddar cheese... I guess I'll write up a new recipe as I thought this recipe was way lacking in flavor.

I normally use jalapenos in my tuna and when I saw this I thought I'd give it a try. The rice vinegar gives it a flavor kind of like Miracle Whip. A great blend of flavors.

I also added some celery and used tahini instead of mayo. Overall, a nice twist on tuna salad.
