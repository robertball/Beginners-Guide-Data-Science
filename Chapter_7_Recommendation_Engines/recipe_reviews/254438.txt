Very good!! I added some chopped celery and Dijon mustard. Used dill relish instead of chopping a pickle. Also halved the balsamic vinegar. Served on good toasted buns instead of bread. Delicious!!

Really good panini. I added one more tablespoon of mayonnaise and buttered the bread. Delicious.

I was quite skeptical about the balsamic vinegar but after everything was done it turned out to be a very flavorful panini.

I added Dijon mustard, some avocado and some spices. Also i made it on a tortilla not on bread. It was very flavorful and definitely will make it again...

Buttered the bread (I always do on a panini), substituted 1/4 cup sauerkraut (no juice) for the pickle and vermont cheddar for american to make it lactose free. Served alongside bean and corn salad and dipped in Russian dressing. Tad too much vinegar OR may not have drained the tuna enough as it made my bread quite soggy before I could get it into the press. In either case, will definitely make again.

Excellent!  I used Albacore White Tuna and a multi-grain hearty bread.  YUMMY!  So good on a cold night!
