My oh my, was this delicious! Simply perfect dish! Smells great, looks pretty and tastes so good you'll thank yourself for making this! I used a variety of peppers, poblano, jalapeno, and yellow and orange bell peppers. I almost took a short cut and was just going to chop and saute them, but I'm so glad I adhered to the recipe and roasted them first, which didn't require much more effort. The skins slipped off easily, and I think roasting the peppers contributed depth of flavor. I didn't bother with the green onion, as I found the regular onion sufficient. Once I combined the sauteed chicken with the pepper mixture I found that simmering that mixture 10-15 minutes was enough to cook the chicken. I believe 25 minutes would have made it overcooked and quite probably dry and chewy. Half the amount of cilantro was perfect for hubs and me, but that is a matter of personal taste buds. For added richness I swirled in a little butter at the end. I served this over white rice with a side of "Black Beans with Bacon," also from this site. I am really surprised that as I write this only 17 other people have reviewed it. I hope this review will encourage more cooks to give this recipe a try!

I made this when I got tomatilloes in my CSA (farm delivery) box and didn't know what to do with them.  A great, tasty supper dish!  I did add a serrano pepper as suggested, for extra kick.  It was tangy and flavorful, the flour coating helped the chicken to retain just a bit of crispness as well as giving the sauce body.  I served this with black beans and cornbread.  Yum!  A keeper.  

For the peppers: Put charred peppers into a Ziploc and close, allow to cool, and then peel off the skins.  This steams the peppers and allows the skins to come off more easily.  The oven roasting was great, though if you have a gas stove you can also char them directly on the burner.  The roasting adds nice depth to the dish.

5 stars if eaten with black beans & bacon (from this site) and rice...as suggested by Naples. What a hit it is when those two are combined with this recipe!! Leftovers were fabulous - and then I added some to Cottage Cheese Chicken Enchiladas and it REALLY enhanced the yum-factor of that recipe! Overall, a satisifying concoction that really complements other recipes!

This was excellent and the smell of the peppers roasting was heavenly. Do not skip this step! I did have problem getting the skin off of the Anaheims even after placing them in the freezer so I gave up and ended up chopping them up skin and all but I didn't notice it in the finished dish. I served it up in corn tortillas and 5 stars all the way!

This is very good!  I forgot to make the black beans I wanted - I'll have to remember them next time!  My husband and kids don't like them anyway!  I do think it'd give this dish the "fill" it needs.

I used two very large poblanos and added two serrano peppers.  I also seasoned the flour with white pepper and jalapeno powder.  I think I may add more broth next time and serve it over rice.  As it stands, there wouldn't have been enough juice to flavor up the rice.

I roasted the peppers and heated the sauce the night before to allow the flavors to blend better.  I was cooking stuff on the stovetop anyway, so keeping an eye on the peppers was easy.  I think 25 minutes is too long to roast them, as they were quite cooked when done.  Next time I'll use my own method of oiling them up and roasting them on the proprane grill.

I also added a splash of fresh-squeezed lime juice before serving also.

Very good - thank you!

I added 2 jalapenos to this dish - one was roasted, and the other was sauteed. I also used more chicken broth than the recipe called for so we'd have more sauce. 
Loved how it tasted sweet at first and then the heat came out and rounded out the flavors - definitely add jalapenos to give this recipe some life.

Thanks for submitting this recipe Suzanne! I made it for dinner last night and my husband loved it! He couldn't stop raving about how great it turned out. 

I did make a few modifications. I added some additional chicken broth it to give it enough juice to simmer in. I also added some lime to add some additional flavor. I will definitely be adding this to my recipe box.

Very tasty but not quite as spicy as I expected. I used the tip mentioned by a previous reviewer of putting the roasted peppers in the freezer for a few mins - the skins came off easy peasy. Thanks!

I will definitely be making this one again!  I don't know if my produce was "larger" than intended in the recipe, but I needed almost double the chicken broth and a LARGE saucepan.    Note to those who have not charred and removed skins from peppers before...allow extra time - as it's not easy (I found out the hard way) but it is definitely worth the effort to get at least SOME of the skins off.  (Plus the roasted peppers add an extra dimension to the dish)

Sorry, we didn't care for the tomatillos.  It was the first time I have ever used them and was very disappointed with the flavor.  Don't know what I expected, but will never use again.  Also when I roasted the peppers, some were just too thin to peel so I lost all the pepper.  Luckily there were extra to add.  Will never make again.

This was good and even better the next day.  The only thing I did different from the recipe was adding a can of corn and a serrano pepper.  Also, I used both red and yellow bell pepper.  I served with chicken-flavored rice and refried beans.  The next day, we ate all three wrapped up in fresh, flour tortillas.

This combination of flavors was excellent! I didn't have Anaheim but added some serano peppers. I also added a little bit of Rotel into the sauce pan while simmering. I purred the pepper/tomatillo mixture. I kept the chicken in breasts, but pounded them to 1/4 inch thick. Poured some of the sauce over the chicken once browned and after simmering for 20 minutes covered, I added a little sour cream and extra chicken broth. Served with rice and some monterray jack cheese.

Awesome!!! So surprisingly delicious! I eliminated the hot peppers because my young children were eating this dish. I replaced them with green and red bell pepper and for the onion, I used a shallot. I had about 6-8 tomatillos so I doubled the chicken broth. This dish was such a hit my husband was back for seconds and thirds...

Very flavorful and healthy!!! My husband even loved it and he is not a big fan of peppers. This is definitely not very spicy. I used dried green onions. I also broiled the veggies in step one for 7-10 mins instead of baking which takes longer. This recipe still takes about 1.5 hrs...but it is worth it!!!! Use a large sauce pan for step two...no way a medium saucepan would have held all of my veggies. Delicious! I served this over brown rice.

This was our first time using tomatillos and we were not crazy about their taste, so I had to use some sugar to tone that down.  Next time I would use less of those and make the day ahead because the next day it rocked!

This dish came out amazing. The flavor of the roasted peppers is so rich and mixed in with the tang of the tomatillos, it's untouchable.

Very good! The roasting peppers smelled delicious in my house. I roasted my peppers on a griddle, for about 25 minutes. After they were nice and black and blistery, I put them inside a plastic bag for 10 minutes. The steam that's created helps make the skin easier to peel off. I still had a little trouble getting all the skin off the poblano peppers, but who cares? Another thing, I only had 1 Anaheim pepper and no tomatillos, but who cares? It still tasted great with a nice serving of some Spanish rice on the side!

this was quick and easy; substituted roasted jalopenos for the peppers since they were in the freezer.  Even better the 2nd day.

This was a great recipe!  A couple of things I would do differently for the consistency - mix the pepper and tomatillo mixture in my chopper a few times to make it more incorporated and more like a sauce.  Mine was a chunky vegetable mixture.  The flavors were great - I had 3 poblanos, 1 jalapeno and 2 sweet bell peppers.  Roasting them is a must!!!  I also didn't have green onions, so I used 1/2 of a vidalia.  I don't use wheat flour, so I dredged the chicken in white bean flour.  I don't think it's a necessary step, sauteed chicken would be just fine.  Served with black beans (put some poblanos and onions in that, too) and rice.

We love this recipe! So full of flavor!  I had to sub in one jalapeno for the Anaheim peppers - next time I will use 2 for a little more heat, but I'm hoping to be able to come across the anaheim chiles. I served with the black bean & rice recipe on this site - it was perfect! Thank you for sharing!!

This was beautiful, as well as tasty. The zing was just right for me, one who doesn't like full-on heat. I am also not a cook, but I pulled this off pretty easily. I would make it again.

I'm glad to find a dish with traditional Mexican ingredients without the cheese and lard.
I stumbled across this recipe when I had made some impulse purchases earlier this week and searched this website for recipes that had tomatillos and poblanos. I did make one alteration...I used vegeterian "chicken" strips as I am vegetarian.  Still, I'm glad that I didn't simply pass over this recipe because it originally used meat.

All I can say is Yum! My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. I wish could have made more but is a keeper. I roasted the peppers on the stove top, seeded, and chopped. Will make this over and over!

I was trying to duplicate a dish I ate at popular Mexican restaurant. This dish was so good. It was spot on. I did not dredge my chicken in flour--simply seasoned it and browned it in olive oil. I also pureed the sauce before simmering the chicken.  Served it with black beans and lime cilantro rice (used a recipe I found on allrecipes.com).

I made this because like another user, I received some tomatillos in my "farm box" and had no clue what to do with them and other peppers I received. I made the mistake of putting 5 poblano peppers in instead of 3; I didn't have Anaheim peppers and green onion, so I didn't put those in. The dish ended up being way too spicy for my family's taste but it still was an excellent dish! It would have been so much better if I hadn't gone wild with the poblanos... I served it with rice and vodka mango smoothies to "cool our tongues" and it turned out fine! The chicken was especially good after taking it out of the sauce.

Yum. this was awesome. Totally took the short cuts, and it was still great. I blipped the pablanos in the processor no grilling but i think i would make it even better, no aniheims, added a bananna pepper and a red jalapeno (from the garden) I used left over chicken from a rotissery (this would be great with thanksgiving turkey scraps). Had to double the broth to cook it down into a saucey mix, then served over rice. The tomatillos didnt smell real good when i started cooking them, but the end result was fabulous. Nice & spicy with the additions. I think I'll also add in our companies Fusion Garden Fresh Cilantro Lime Salsa and use this recipe on our website for SalsaFundraiser.com. Very Good i will definitely make this again.

This was delicious.  My husband is on a restricted diet, so I used a salt substitute.  I also sprayed a pan with Pam and cooked the chicken without the oil.  Next time I'll serve the cilantro on the side and add the juice of a lime just before serving.

Husband and I loved it.  kids- not so much.  I pureed the ingredients to make a sauce, used all poblano peppers (it's what i had) and it made a hearty meal that didn't even need the rice I served it over.

This recipe was absolutely fantastic and easy to make. There are a few steps, but they're really simple to follow. The dish came out wonderfully smoky and piquant without being overpoweringly hot. I served it over white rice, which soaked up the sauce nicely.   I roasted all the peppers and the tomatillos, which I think added a nice flavor, but it was very difficult to remove the skins from the bell peppers, and I didn't notice anything strange in the taste or texture because I did so.  This recipe is very nicely flexible; I couldn't find Anaheim chile peppers and used jalapenos instead, used two of both of those and two small bell peppers. I also accidentally used half the onion, garlic, and chicken because I only sporadically remembered that I was cutting it down.  The combination of flavors here is really magical, and I'm not sure you can go too seriously wrong without trying!

To those that had trouble with the skin on the peppers -- don't give up!  Try again; you won't regret it.  450 oven, blacken pasillos or tomatillos or jalapenos.  Place blackened pasillos in a ziploc for 10 minutes.  No problem, the skins will be peeling off whole and the extra flavor is worth it.  We had some red chiles in a jar and chopped them; but kept them out till the very end for color --- same as for the celantro.  It is easier to do this with a partner; one chops, one gets the spices and gets the pots ready - have fun.  For a base we used black beans mixed with Minute Rice.  Be patient, this recipe is worth the extra time. It's a beautiful ting!

So yummy and pretty! I only cooked 3 breasts and used 2 poblanos, 2 Anaheim's, about half of an onion, 1 lb. tomatillos, and kept the portions equivalent on the rest of the ingredients. Didn't have green onions, and was still great! It's important to simmer the pepper mix long enough to get the tomatillos tender.

Absolutely delightful! My gf and I enjoy this meal once a month now. An excellent use of peppers and you can even change the peppers depending on how hot you want the dish. I add a green bell pepper as well and serve with black beans. DELICIOUS!

I've always wanted to make something with tomatillos, and with all the great reviews, this is what I tried.  I loved all of the fresh ingredients, but took a lot of time to prepare.  This dish had good flavor, but didn't stand out as something I had to make again.

We loved this recipe.  I think next time I will roast the peppers under the broiler (5 minutes) and then put them in a paper bag to steam for a few minutes.  I like the idea of adding black beans and think I will do that next time. 

I will definately be adding this recipe to my recipe box.

I LOVED this! I'd give it five stars, except I had to make modifications. I used dried cilantro in place of the fresh, a Cubanelle pepper in place of the Anaheims (the store didn't have any), pre-cooked deli fresh diced chicken (which allowed me to skip most of the third step, which drastically cut down cooking time), a pinch of red pepper flakes since I was out of cayenne, and I did add two serrano peppers for an added kick. I served this over white rice, and it was plenty filling. My father even managed to sneak away with the little bit of leftovers I had. I plan on making this again and again, thank you so much, Suzanne!

This is a very colorful and SPICY dish. I also loved the salsa, which had a thick, yet smooth consistency. Although I enjoy spicy dishes, I think next time I will reduce the amount of chiles or seed them. Thanks!

This received very good comments from all of our dinner guests.  A lighter Mexican fare.  The tomatillos were a delicious addition and the red peppers roasted beautifully. (Be sure the skin has separated before removing from the oven.  Then place in the freezer for a few minutes and the skin will separate even further.) I did add more heat via a jalapeno and some hot sauce.

This recipe is ridiculously good. The peppers and the cilantro play nicely off each other to make for a flavorful medley. I would probably make this much more frequently, but it is very labor intensive. It takes me nearly 2 hours to make it, and most of that time I'm actively on my feet cooking. (30 minutes roasting the peppers, 30 minutes fighting with the pepper skins and seeds, 15 minutes cooking the veggie mix, 30 minutes sauteing and simmering)

This is an amazing dish!  My husband loved it so much that he asked me to make it for company just a couple of days after I made it the first time.  We did not use bell peppers - we used the non-heat peppers from our garden and added a little more chicken broth than it called for.  We did everything else as directed.  It’s a great healthy dish!!!

So good. I didn’t grow tomatillos this year so I used green tomatoes. I often substitute green tomatoes for tomatillos and really like the flavor. We loved this.

Amazing!  I didn't have anaheim chiles, so I used a yellow and a red roasted bell pepper instead.  I also decreased the cooking oil to 1 tbsp.  I served this as a topper for stuffed poblanos.  (Giant broiled poblano halves with a layer of refried beans and brown rice, topped with this recipe.)  It is a bit time consuming, but well worth it!

The best I’ve made (off of any recipe site) in the 5 years I’ve been doing this. 
Absolutely amazing.
Modifications:  I halved the recipe since there are only two of us.  Used a Hatch chile instead of the Anahiem (they’r in season now). Added a jalapeño from the garden.  Added a tablespoon or so of turbinado and about ¾ cup of chicken stock.  Then I roasted all the peppers and tomatillos on the grill before skinning them and adding ‘em to the pot.
I forgot the oregano and the cilantro…those could have made it even better, if that’s possible.  Just fantastic. ( I just finished the leftovers for lunch – just as good).
Great recipe.

I bought but forgot to add the cilantro. This was good though. I used fewer peppers to make sure it wasn't spicy for my kids.

I unfortunately had some tomatillos that weren't quite ripe and as flavorful as I expected, and I think that they leant to a dish that was really, really tangy, without as much depth as I would expect from my experience. But I threw in a couple of tablespoons of brown sugar, topped with queso blanco, avocado, and sour cream, and the recipe was very good. I will definitely try again with riper tomatillos. Unripe ingredients good be why people struggle with peeling their poblano/pasilla peppers, as well, or not searing them on high enough heat to blister the skins. But well worth the effort, and a nice change of pace.

I was looking for a recipe to use up a bunch of poblano and anaheim chilies I had and although we don't care for tomatillos there was enough other flavors they were not too prevalent.  We did find the called for amount of cilantro just too strong.  The chicken was very tender.  I served over toasted up rounds of polenta.

I really liked this one - I also added 2 jalapenos (both roasted) - great spice and flavor. I cooked the chicken for 15 mins instead of the full 25mins and the chicken was perfect. Too spicy for the kids. I'll make this again for sure.

It was pretty good.  Kind of like a Mexican version of Sweet and Sour chicken.  Its a fairly labor intensive recipe.  I likely won't make it again - not worth all the work.

I made this for dinner! It was awesome.  I was looking for a recipe that used Tomatillos and when I read the recipe and I knew I had almost everything on hand.  
I made some variations from the recipe.  I didn't have any Anaheim chile peppers on hand so I substituted by adding extra Pablano peppers.  I didn't use vegetable oil.  I substituted for a healthier version of oil (Coconut Oil).  The recipe hadn't called for Parsley and I had fresh Parsley so I added that as well as the Fresh Cilantro.  I didn't have black beans to add.  I know I will make this again since it was a very good dinner and I will make certain to get black beans ahead of time when I expect to make it again.

Made this the other night, served it with white rice and black beans, really enjoyed it. My boyfriend was not a huge fan, but that's not the recipe's fault, just a matter of taste. Aside from shorting myself one poblano (reading failure on my part) I followed it exactly and it came out great. In the future I might cut back on the tomatillo a little just to make it more palatable for the other half, but I think it's great as is.

I really liked this and it's a great way to use poblanos. I didn't make rice, but next time I will serve it over, as it was quite juicy. Really good, though.

So good! I mix and match my peppers but it always comes out well. I've also experimented with baking the chicken and then dumping the mixture on top. Not as much flavor but still good and better for us.

All of the flavors were delicious, but the oregano was too overpowering...I would cut it down to a teaspoon...or eliminate it altogether.  Way too much oregano.  Otherwise it was fantastic. I also skipped the flour dredge and didn't miss it at all.  That took this recipe into the low-carb zone, which is nice when you are a Mexican/ Tex-Mex junkie and need to watch those things.

This dish was good, and a great use for our produce co-op Mexican basket! My husband now compares any salsa verde to this sauce...and this sauce always wins.

This was pretty good.  I roasted a jalapeno along with the other peppers and added it to the dish.  The skins of the peppers didn't exactly "slip right off" even though I allowed them to steam in a paper bag for a few minutes after roasting.  The peeling process took some effort.  And although I browned the chicken breast chunks and then removed them from the pan to keep them from over cooking, and put them back in with the cilantro, they still came out dry and tough.  Next time, I'll use thighs instead.  Otherwise, we really liked this.  I think it could have used more heat, maybe some cayenne or an un-roasted, chopped jalapeno would do the trick.  I will definitely make it again.  Thanks, Suzanne!

All of my four kids, plus my husband ate this and enjoyed it!  Have made it twice and used whatever combination of peppers I have on hand.  We like dark chicken and therefore used thighs.  Very good.

I found all of the fresh ingredients at the farmers market and wanted something different to try. I pulsed the tomatillos in the food processor instead of dicing them and used a chopped medium yellow onion instead of green onions. I also added about another cup of broth so it would be saucy enough to serve over rice. My DH loved it, I do not like peppers, but the chicken was good, the grown kids also loved it. It was labor intensive roasting the peppers and cooking the chicken.

Having never made anything with tomatillos before, this recipe was very good. I didn't use the Anaheim pepper because they didn't carry them in my grocery store, but it was good with just the poblanos. Other than that I followed the recipe as directed and served it over brown rice. Next time I have tomatillos, I will make this for sure!

Very good.  Made this one for a dinner party and it was very well received.  Only changes I made were with tomatillos - couldn't find them fresh, so I used canned (worked perfectly) and I kept the chicken breasts whole.  Gave the dish a quick lime squeeze before serving and served with black beans and white rice.
