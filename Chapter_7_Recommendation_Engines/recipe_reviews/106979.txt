This recipe is awesome with just a couple of tweaks:  double the mangos saut√© the tofu with the garlic and ginger (make sure to cut it small) and add a bit of cayenne.  One of my favorite dishes to make, always a crowd pleaser.

I am so glad you guys like this recipe so much! It is good with just the tofu but you should really try shrimp or chicken as well. I like to just get the frozen shrimp in the bag. It's cheaper that way but it does take a little more time if you get the ones you have to peel. I think it's more than worth it! I have a few other recipes that have been submitted for a while now. I am hoping that they will eventually get published. Thanks again and enjoy

This was okay.  It was my first time making a curry dish.  I like how the mangoes were incorporated in this dish and the contrasting tastes of the coconut milk and curry.  However, it felt like something was missing.  Needs more sodium, in my opinion.

Try this with shrimp! It's quite delicious. Also, since this is entitled "Indian" I decided to make it more Indian in preparation by substituting the sesame oil with ghee and roasted the curry powder (home made) in the ghee before adding garlic, ginger and mango. This brings out the spice and flavor of the curry powder. I also added a sliced thai chili. This really brought the heat. Also I garnished the dish with the cilantro (and lime wedges) instead of cooking. Delicious!

I'm always looking for good tofu recipes, and this one was a hit.  It was very quick to make, and was delicious served over rice.

I first made this like 2 years ago and rated it like 4 or 5 stars... but today I made it and followed the recipe and it was totally bland and boring. I even added broccoli and red peppers. We had to add like 1 tsp of salt and it was still bland. I think my taste buds have changed over the years... but this was so totally not spicy at all - how can they call it "hot" in the recipe title and it's not even spicy?!

I tried this recipe twice.  The first time I followed the recipe word for word , and I thought it was kind of bland.  The second time I fried the tofu (after making sure it was fell drained) with the garlic and ginger.  I also added asian noodles, red bell pepper, and onions.  I used 4 tbs of curry, and maybe a half teaspoon of cayenne pepper.  It was better but not fabulous.  I think the mango pulp would be better in this recipe than sliced mango.  Also, what exactly about this is Indian??

We really just weren't wild about this dish. It may just have something to do with personal tastes, but I don't think I'll be making this one again. Sorry!

This was delicious!! I've made it several times already and it's great. I like to use coconut cream instead of ccnt milk to make it sweeter, I also use more than one mango, add some garam masala to it, and water chestnuts for cruntch.

Very good and will try again. Didn't have standard yellow curry so used 3 different types of Penzey's curries:       Added extra mango and cut tofu into 1/2" cubes and next time will all tofu to garlic/ginger mix as BabyJesus recommends.

I don't make curry a lot simply because at home I could never get it to come out the way it does in restaurants.  I don't care too much for those melt away curry cubes for the same reason.  This recipe is easy and excellent and I'm kinda peeved I couldn't have figured this our myself.  I used the yellow curry by Marketplace, a Target brand.  It's delicious as is but it leaves room for so much creativity.  You can add hot peppers for a diff flavor or substitute the tofu for chicken or shrimp.  I'm going to add veggies next time and maybe green onion.  It's earned a regular spot in my rotation.

I followed some of the comments and it turned out great!
1. I used ghee and sauteed the curry and other spices for a minute or two at the beginning. I used a curry power mix and added some extra cardamom, coriander, roasted chili powder, and salt. 
2. I fried the tofu in the ghee/spices (it didn't seem like there was enough oil, so I added some coconut oil as well). I also added chili paste for extra heat.
3. I added red bell pepper (highly recommend organic or home grown, which I have found to be ten times sweeter than regular ones, especially during the winter)
4. I didn't have any cilantro (it's not my favorite), but I added flat leaf parsley and it was ok. Don't know if I'd do that again though.

Over rice, it was really delicious. It kind of seemed like it was still missing something, some "deeper" flavor. But also maybe I'd add nutmeg. Or maybe fennel, anise, or another licorice flavor. 

I can see it being very good with chicken. It's definitely something I'd make again!

This was my first time cooking with tofu. It was so so so delicious and super easy to make. I served it with basmati rice cooked using canned coconut milk. I will definitely be making this again.

Except for adding a red bell pepper for some crunch I followed the recipe exactly and I love all the ingrediants, but we found this to be really bitter.  Maybe just my type of curry powder coupled with the amount, I don't know but I won't make again

The ingredients were promising, but the recipe turned out to be as bland as others said. Because of the prior comments, I tried marinating the tofu in the seasonings/spices with oil, then cooking it separately prior to adding the mango and coconut milk. I'm not sure what would have worked better. When I marinate tofu using soy sauce and spices/seasonings, then cook it, it comes out very flavorful. This didn't, and putting coconut milk over it seemed to wash out the flavor even more. Maybe this recipe can only be done well with meat/fish.

This recipe was waaaaaaaayyyyy too hot , I couldn't taste the mango or any thing else for that matter. I used shrimp and asian noodles, next time I'll put a lot less curry and ginger, and add some vegetables.

Blah...I love a good curry but this had waaaayyyy to much ginger for me. All I could taste was ginger. I was hoping it would be better the second day, but it wasn't. Maybe I'll try again cut down on the ginger...

Great recipe.  Very adaptable.  AND it enlightened me to the possibilities of the surprisingly versatile mango!  

Laura, maybe it depends on how you cooked the chicken.  One thing that you could try, if you didn't already, is to cook the chicken first; remove to a platter and keep warm; cook your other ingrediants; add the chicken back in, add your sauce, etc.  Then you should be okay.

Again, great recipe, thanks for sharing!

I tried this recipe with chicken and vegetables and didn't quite get it right. The taste was great (a little too hot for me) but I overcooked the chicken and the veggies. Anyone have ideas?

My wife and I really enjoyed this recipe over some jasmine rice.  Next time, I may substitute basil for cilantro, but it was great!
