One look at this recipe and i just HAD to make it..(cilantro gets me every time). I only used one can of Tuna, as i was making it for just myself. Also used only half the amount of celery and onion. I used the ENITRE amount of Cilantro, because I LOVE the flavor and the full amount of relish. Used Mayonnaise(half amount) instead of Miracle whip, replaced regular mustard with Dijon and added Salt and Pepper. This was absolutly awesome!! From now on this is how i will be eating my Tuna!

I loved the recipe but of course I want a real kick so I changed it up. I used all ingredients. I cut Mayo in half and added half olive oil and used Dijon over regular mustard. I added a whole finely diced Jalapeno, a few dashes of hot sauce, salt & pepper, half of a fresh squeezed lime and a small amount of garlic.   Now there is really a nice kick to this recipe!  I will make this again Fantastic!!

Not sure what the "kick" is, but we enjoyed it on a pita bread sandwich for lunch today.  The cilantro, no hard boiled egg, and a little bit of mustard was a nice change from my traditional tuna salad.

The cilantro was a nice addition, but I still thought this was rather plain tasting--the title says it has a kick, which implies spicy. I added some cumin, a sprinkle of cayenne pepper and a dash of hot sauce. That really brought out the flavor of the cilantro for me. If I make this again, I would leave out the relish.

I didn't have prepared mustard so I used Dijon and I skipped the cilantro. I added some chopped jalapeno which gave it some heat. I actually used fresh tuna from a meal we had earlier. This turned out well with good flavor and crunchy. I would use this again for a tuna salad recipe.

Love this as is and also with some variations. But I want to stress it is delicious before any changes I made. I love cilantro so used the max amount but only one can of tuna. Cut down on the mustard, used light mayo and added a splash of lime juice ( which I think goes nicely with cilantro). Lemon juice works well too. Just a touch. Seemed to add a nice accent note.
