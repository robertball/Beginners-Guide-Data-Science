Great recipe and super easy to make.  


My only suggestion is that if you made them beforehand and cover them overnight or a few hours, to use foil or plastic wrap sprayed with Pam.  I covered my Pyrex baking dishes with the plastic pyrex covers and the tops stuck to the cover ... so they didn't look super pretty.

These are amazing!  We love them with a fried egg for breakfast or brunch too.  I have been making them on the hawaiian bread hamburger buns, which makes 6 sandwiches.   I only use a half pound of shaved ham and have only used swiss and it's worked great. They also reheat well in the microwave in a few seconds.

These were delicious! But I used 2 packages of rolls, 1 1/2 pounds of ham and I doubled the butter sauce- this way I used up all of the cream cheese. I'm glad I did, because just 12 wouldn't have been enough.

The recipe only calls for one stick of butter, not two, rosethecook. 1/2 cup butter is 1 stick.

These were very good.  I used a regular swiss cheese that I already had.  I also used a popular brand of hawaiian roll, and they were fairly small, so I didn't use all of the cream cheese or ham (and halved each slice of cheese), but there was still plenty on each.  I recommend that you keep an eye on these, as mine were well-done at about 15 minutes.  They probably would have burned had I left them in the entire 20.  Husband thought they were delicious and I will make them again.

It's delicious.  However, I would caution anyone for using 2 sticks butter for this recipe.  Either cut the entire sauce (4 ingredients) to 1/2, or double the amount of buns.  Same for the cheese spread.  It's way too much for 12 buns.  Truthfully, you need 2 packages of buns to follow the recipe.

MOUTHWATERING!  I used thinly sliced boiled ham from the deli.  I also used the individually wrapped swiss cheese slices (similar to the American cheese slices) because they really melt easily and smoothly. Each sandwich only requires 1/2 slice of cheese.  If you leave the sandwiches covered a little after removing from the oven, the rolls are nicely steamed and soft.  These are a tasty and inexpensive way to feed a crowd--a definite crowd pleaser.  Thank you.

Wow, these are really good.  Have made them twice, baking for the recommended 20 minutes the first time...they were a little too brown.  This time, I took them out at 15 minutes and they were heated through perfectly.  Keep your eye on them because they start to brown pretty quickly, and you may want to cover with some foil to complete the cooking.  I can see making these so many different ways just by changing what's between the top and bottom bun, but keeping the butter sauce the same.  I'm thinking turkey and swiss with AR's onion jam recipe, and Italian beef, mozzarella, and some roasted red peppers and onions .  Yeah, they're a little decadent nutrition-wise, but they're worth the splurge every now and then.  Definitely worth consideration for a Super Bowl party.

I was on my own the night I made this recipe, so I made a single sandwich using a hamburger bun.  I scaled the other ingredients down to two servings, but didn’t use nearly the amount of cream cheese spread.  I wrapped my sandwich in non-stick foil and baked for 20 minutes.  When I opened the foil the top was a little soggy, so I popped it under the broiler to crisp it up.  I really wanted to like this, but the warm, runny cream cheese just didn’t do it for me.  It was edible, but I won’t be making it again.  Sorry.

Made this for lunch and it was so good. I didn't have onion and chive cream cheese so I used regular and added chives and onion powder. I cooked covered for 10 min and uncovered for 5. It was not soggy. I also used Swiss cheese. Really delicious sandwich for a quick lunch.

These were off the charts amazing!! Made a triple batch for my husband's poker night and the guys were actually asking if they could take some home...the problem being there were no "leftovers".  Between the guys and my children sneaking in repeatedly to "steal" a sandwich they disappeared.

We enjoyed this recipe...but there was way too much butter for 12 buns.  Next time, I will cut the sauce in half.  Thanks for sharing!

These are amazing. I got so many rave reviews and the pan was gone very quickly. Like others said - do NOT use the entire tub of cream cheese. You need half at most. Also, I only used 1/3 cup butter and that was plenty. I will definitely be making these again.

These were outstanding.  For twelve Hawaiin rolls I bought 1/2 pound of ham and 1/4 pound of cheese, sliced.  Didn't need even half of the cream cheese.

There is a step missing that will help people who thought the sandwiches were too soggy.  After you've baked them for 20 minutes covered, remove the foil & bake for another 5 minutes.  This browns & crisps the top of the rolls.  This step is included in Caren's original recipe.  I made these for the second time today (the first was when the recipe was originally posted on Food Network).  The recipes are very close to identical - one makes chive & onion creamed cheese & the other you buy it premade.  I also used grated swiss cheese this time - much cheaper & as delicious.  Both times the sandwiches were devoured.  A hit with everyone.

Better than Arby's! And I love how flexible these can be. Turkey, Roast Beef, cheddar, swiss, provolone. I can't wait to try all the different combinations!

This recipe was delicious.  I made the recipe exactly as stated above with the exception of the dried minced onions because I didn't have any.  These sammies were the hit of our Super Bowl party.  For those who didn't like the recipe, it's probably because you didn't make as directed and used a hamburger bun instead of the sweet hawaiian rolls which makes all the difference. Cook as directed and you won't be disappointed.

Use Harvarti Cheese in place of the Gruyere. I have made it both ways, for the same party crowd, and the harvarti version was perferred all around. GREAT sandwiches, and so easy to prep the night before, and then bake the day of!

These sandwiches are fantastic!!!  I only used a half pound of ham, and only put half a slice of cheese per sandwich, so perhaps that made them a little healthier.  I also prefer Havarti cheese over the Gruyere.  I made half the amount of butter sauce as well, and thought that was plenty to flavor it.  My boyfriend can't get enough of these, thanks for great recipe!!!  They're perfect for football season!

These are pretty good.  A tad too cheesy for me, and hubby wasn't so pleased with the minced onion, but we both enjoyed them enough to give them 4 stars.  :)  I'd probably only do the cheese spread next time, and use minced garlic for the hubby.  Very easy, a little bit of prep time, but not much.  If I'd made these ahead of time they'd have been even quicker!  I used turkey bacon instead of ham--I didn't want to pull out a huge thing of sliced ham when it was just me for the rest of the week.  thanks for the recipe!

I have made these so many different ways using different ingredients but keeping the same butter sauce. I've used smoked turkey and brie with honey mustard, ham, gruyere and bacon bits with the chive cream cheese, thinly sliced roast beef, cheddar and horseradish cream cheese... My family loves them and they're great for Sunday football or a simple cocktail party!

I made these I loved them so much. I was the only one eating (cause my 5 year old didnt like the cream cheese) so I had too many leftover that went to waste but I cant wait to make these again for a party.  Oh yea and they reheat really well in the oven!

In spite of me these turned out 5 stars for a recent 'Girls Day Out' gathering at the beach house.  The night before I was tired, in a hurry and just skimmed over the recipe.  I mistakenly mixed the chive and onion cream cheese in with the sauce ingredients!  I went ahead and spread some of the mixture onto the roll tops.  Made the sauce (this time!) according to recipe, etc.  Baked 15 min. covered/5 min. uncovered.  These were a real hit!!!  We had fun coming up with different ways to fix these in the future: using small crescent rolls, different types of meats, cheeses, sun dried tomatoes, etc. etc.  Nothing like pooling together our culinary resources!!!  Thanks AR for submitting this recipe.

For both the hubbies and the food snob in me. Original recipe a "10". But open to UNLIMITED substitutions. By "generous" spread of cream cheese; i found that 1/4" is PLENTY.  I used the entire container the first time...yuck. A container will make 3 dozen.  I always cut the fat by half , and have even  subbed some olive oil instead. Have also just made my  own melted  garlic butter and grated fresh parm on top. Can' go wrong. Tent your foil to cover and you have no worries. Travels well too.  Am making again tonight for couples ping pong gathering.

I made the sandwiches exactly as prescribed, except I substituted swiss cheese for the gruyere. The sandwiches were tasty, but far too sweet for my palate. If I ever make them again, I might experiment with adding mustard, or maybe pickles.

Everyone raved about these, will surely be making them for get togethers for some time to come.  I used 2 packages of small hawaiian rolls, 1 lb good quality brown sugar ham, 1/2 lb lacey swiss cheese and added some honey mustard to the topping mix.  I think the meat/cheese/bread ratio was just right.  Also didn't use the whole tub of cream cheese, just gave a generous spread.  Uncovered the sandwiches for last 5-10 minutes so the tops crisped up a little.  This cost about $20 to make so I'll probably just make for special occassions.  Most of my other appetizers are less expensive, but this was worth it, don't skimp on quality ingredients!!

Good little sandwich. I liked the onion and worcestershire flavors and would have preferred both of these to have been stronger. I didn't care for the cream cheese part though. The sweet hawaiian roll goes well with the savory flavors. I expected the tops to be soggy from the butter/worcestershire spooned over, but they weren't at all! I'll fix this again leaving the cream cheese off or making a super thin layer. I made my own spread with plain cream cheese softened, dried chives and a little onion powder. The cream cheese flavor was fine, the texture was all wrong.

This worked well for my party.  I used thick sliced ham from a baked ham rather than deli cuts, to make it more hearty.

So tasty! I love how the bottom of the sandwiches got nice and buttery with a slight crispness.  Followed the recipe fairly close.  I'm sure gruyere is amazing compared to the sliced swiss i used instead but.....wow, it's expensive.  I start to make the butter mixture,   awww ...out of parm cheese :\  Well, maybe this shredded cheddar will do? Oops! Forgot to cover with foil.  Whatever, they turned out great!

These are fun and tasty, too!! Which will always get you five stars in my book. I do have to admit to sneaking into the fridge, after everyone went to bed, to hijack the leftovers. But shhhh... don't tell. 
I did cut the butter in half, I think that was a typo with the recipe writer and it was just what the chef ordered on a cloudy overcast day in the PNW.

The recipe might not look like much, but they are super tasty!  I used Buddig ham instead of deli ham and that's the only substitution I made. My husband loved them and he's exclusively a meat and potatoes guy.

This recipe is a huge success with my family and friends.  I think you should follow the recipe with the exact ingredients because they are best that way.  However, 1/2 pound of the ham is plenty and the cheese can be cut down too.  If you have not tried it with the gruyere cheese, you are missing out because it is amazing.  As for the butter, well my friend and I think almost anything is better with a stick of butter! :)

I have had these several times just without the cream cheese. I did make a couple changes to the recipe. Left out the honey mustard and added 2 tablespoons of sugar to the sauce. Used Swiss cheese because that is all I had. I didn't have the cream cheese the recipe called for so just whipped block cream cheese with onion and herb seasoning. Baked at 375 for 15 minutes on 2nd to the bottom rack. Didn't cover either. We like crisp tops.

This recipe is delicious! My whole family loved it. I took the advice of others and sprayed my foil with nonstick cooking spray. I have tried this with white american cheese and provolone. Both were very good. Costco carries a big pack (24 or 36...can't remember...) of hawaiian rolls for around $3.45!

Love these! It's a great party dish! I love that you can make a bunch ahead of time and then just pop in the oven when you're ready for them! They even reheat well the next day in the microwave.  Have made these quite a few times now!

I've made a similar version of this recipe for years. I love the addition of cream cheese in this recipe. Next time, I would leave out the Gruyere. It's an expensive cheese and the flavor is masked by the cream cheese's strong flavor (and I doubled the batch but kept the cream cheese the same). I also think I may add some Dijon mustard to the butter mixture next time.

Not my taste, too salty and I didn't like the taste of the gruyere cheese. My hubby didn't love them but didn't complain but I won't be making these again. Also I didn't like the sauce on top of the sandwiches because I hate soggy bread and that's exactly what happened.

My family loves this recipe! You can use it just as is. And, it's delish!! We like it with cheesy potato soup! 
Also - Great for parties, or for a Meal Train. I made it for a family in need and they loved it. It's a great make-ahead meal.
You can also make changes - change the cheese, type of meat, omit the cream cheese, etc. It's so versatile. Try it!!

Tasted great but were very soggy.  I didn’t need nearly this much ham or cheese.

Although I've made tons of recipes from Allrecipes, I've never gone far enough to review any of them. However, seeing as how I've been making these sassy sandwiches for over 10 years I felt compelled to review. I started making this recipe for a company potluck and have continued to do so every year. Everyone always asks me if i'm bringing this dish because they can't wait to eat it. I've never deviated from the original recipe and never will. The only suggestion I have taken from a previous reviewer is to cover with foil that has been sprayed with Pam so it doesn't stick. Awesome recipe!

Yum! I just cut Hawaiian rolls in half, topped with ham, cheese, small amount of cream cheese with chives/onions & then poured sauce over top. I made 15 small sandwiches. I didn't have much time to heat them so I microwaved some of them. They were all devoured!

These are amazing!  A co-worker gave me this recipe about two weeks ago, and I've made them six times already!  I make half turkey and half ham because I have some non pork eaters.  My adult children love them.  I can't wait to serve them at a party.  So good and versatile!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I left out the cream cheese and added Dijon mustard to the butter mixture. I used ham, turkey and Swiss.  These were a big hit at a tailgate party.  I doubled the recipe and they were all eaten.

I added a pickle slice and I made my own onion and chive cream cheese.  I was surprised to find that they tasted a lot like a Cuban sandwich.  They were very good.

These are SO good!  I've made them MANY times.  Sometimes I use small pretzel rolls instead of Hawaiian rolls and use brown sugar ham.  Followed the recipe exactly.   Delicious!

These were probably the most savory little sliders I have ever had in my life!!! The only thing I did differently was reduce the ingredients a bit (for calories and to taste), and it turned out perfect! I think if I used the amount the recipe called for it would be way too heavy. 

Things I did differently... I used about 0.6 pounds of ham, 3-4 slices of creamy havarti cheese (subbed for gruyere ,and quartered to fit the bun), reduced fat chive and onion cream cheese, 5 tablespoons of butter, and a little less than 1/4 cup of parmesan. FYI any type of white cheese will work well in this recipe. Enjoy!

OMG...these are so good.  I made them for a neighborhood party and they were gone quickly.  I've been requested to make them again.  I stayed pretty much with the way the recipe was written, but I also made some with turkey and Swiss.  I will definitely make them again.

Loved! And so did everyone I made them for :) I did end up using Swiss cheese instead as I first couldn't find greyere and when I did it seemed a bit expensive where I did find it. They are pretty rich so I had to make a veggie side dish to round it out ;)

Creamy, cheesy, melty, YUMMY!  Couldn't find Gruyere at my local marked so used aged Swiss instead.  These are so good and rich that you don't need to eat too many to fill up quickly.

These sandwiches were an overall hit at my party! Some suggested there was "too much" with the onion flakes and onion and chive spread on top, but that didn't bother me, or the majority of guests. The assembly was a little time-consuming, but an overall easy dish to make. I even had a cold leftover sandwich and it was good! I'm guessing warmed in the microwave for a few seconds wouldn't hurt either!?

I made these when having people over to our house for a birthday party. I was a little nervous since I'd never made these before and they weren't really pretty. I used ham and swiss and these were AH-MAZE-ING!!! They were gone within minutes and I made them again the next day for Sunday football. I will be making these again & again.

Made two pans as a trial run before taking to an upcoming family gathering.  One with the small Hawaiian buns and the other using plain slider buns.  Hands down, the Hawaiian bun was the favorite.  Really showcases the ingredients.
We used Swiss cheese on one pan and provolone on the other....and found the provolone too bland.  We also found the butter mixture a little too rich and too greasy on the fingers so will be using one batch of butter sauce for two pans.  But, I also like someone's idea of simply using garlic butter with fresh grated Parmesan on top...so perhaps another trial run is in store!

I make a very similar version of these little gems with Cajun roast beef and provolone cheese. I also don't use the cream cheese. I tried this as written and thought the cream cheese was a great addition. I will make these along with my roast beef sandwiches from now on.

I absolutely love these. They are quite possibly my favorite recipe when I'm wanting to indulge. I don't ever use as much of the cream cheese. Other than that I follow the recipe. Wow!

I need this recipe about 4 times. The best adjustment was adding caramelized onions to the sandwiches and omitting the onion from the butter/worstershire sauce. then rather dousing the whole thing in butter sauce and letting it sit 20 minutes I simply brush the top of the bread with the butter we're sister. And sprinkled on parmesan. The sandwiches came out much less soggy and nice and toasty and better flavor with the caramelized onion.

These were ok, really greasy. I didn't like all the butter on them. The cream cheese was just too gooey and overwhelming. I won't make these again.

I really liked this and will be making it again.  I used Black Forest Ham and Swiss Cheese.  It was delicious.  I halved the recipe and made some plain ham and cheddar cheese sandwiches for the kids.  Put a little butter on top of them and baked in the same pan.

I would love to make these for a tailgate party.  Has anyone assembled these ahead of time and then heated them on a gas grill instead of an oven?  They look so good!

These were too rich for me.  They also need to be eaten immediately because the butter hardens as they cool and the buns have an interesting texture.

Holy Smokes, my whole family LOVED these little sandwiches. I have two daughters who have different tastes, they raved about this recipe. "Its a keeper, Mom". Im thinking next time we might exchange a few things to create a different flavor combination. Like taco sauce and a southwest cream cheese blend with a smoked chicken breast? Wonderful recipe, thanks so much.

I made these for a work potluck and everyone loved them.  I did think they were a bit oily so the second time I made them I cut back the butter to 5 Tbls for the topping and they were perfect. Have made them with  various different combos of meat and cheese and they are always delicious!
