I have cholesterol issues so I made this with egg whites and margarine...and since I was in an impulsive mood I didn't chill the dough for very long.  However these turned out simply delicious.  Right out of the oven they almost reminded me of scones.  Which isn't a bad thing - I'd eat one of these for breakfast with tea any time.  I'll try it true to recipe next time.

This recipe makes a tasty and pretty cookie.  It would look wonderful on any cookie platter.  My husband loved them because they were not too sweet and would be perfect with a cup of coffee in the morning.
