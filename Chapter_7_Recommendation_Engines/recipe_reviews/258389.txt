I don't understand why so few people tried it, it is just awesome! Did not change anything, added a few drops of vanilla extract (don't know why, I'm always doing this). Tried both hot and cold, it could not be better.

This is fantastic! We serve it at our B&B and it’s always a hit, even for those that claim not to like rice pudding! Don’t change a thing!

Loved this stuff.. I like mine cold so that how I serve this. I think it tasted wonderful even before adding the cream at the end.. caramelized bananas on top.. yum
