Excellent! I take exception to the few lower marks given to this recipe by people who used FROZEN okra. I used one anehiem (sp?) chili pepper and 4 large tomatoes from the garden because it was what I had on hand. I also used an extra slice of bacon because, well, its bacon. I will be making this again!

This made the house smell absolutely wonderful! I added a little bit of ham and used fresh banana peppers and tomatoes from my garden instead of roma tomatoes and chile peppers.

Sooo good, really.  I used this recipe in Phase 1 of my South Beach Diet.  I used red chiles instead and it tasted so great.  I also substituted turkey bacon for the real bacon.  I like the taste of okra and the extra veggies and seasoning made it perfect.  Please try this one.

As far as okra goes this was really good. The only other way I know how to make it is fried so this was a good new way to make it. I let it simmer on high for last ten minutes with the cover off to cook off the liquid because it seemed a little watery. Over all it was good and there was nothing left so that is a good sign. All of the veggies were fresh from my mom's garden.

Very good. I did not add the bacon, instead I cooked the onion and chili peppers in olive oil. Just delicious, thanks Cyndilynn.

I made a vegetarian version of this, which may have been the downfall of the recipe. While it wasn't bad, I don't think it's something I'd make again.  It was pretty bland and mushy.  Additionally, I'm not sure how the vinegar was supposed to help the slime.  The outside of my okra was fine, it was the inside that was slimy.

I was surprised how wonderful this dish was - my experience with Okra has always been fried.  I had some mushrooms and I added them.  I didn't cook it quite as long so the Okra was still somewhat crisp and ate it over rice.   Thanks for the dish!

Delicious recipe! I used fresh from the garden okra and peppers (two), but instead of fresh tomatoes I had to use 1 can of diced tomatoes (including juice). It turned out really good!

Very good! Not sure about the vinegar, may not have used it long enough but just made a few pieces of okra slimey on the outside. Used 10 pieces of Turkey bacon, added 2 fresh jalapenos, 1 bell pepper, 3 stalks of celery, and a can of diced tomatoes because we wanted more tomatoes. Made stock pot, more than 6 servings for us when used as a side.

I really shouldn't rate this because I subbed the veggies for cajun tomatoes, but the soaking of (frozen) okra for 30 minutes while changing the vinegar every 10 minutes STILL left the okra slimy. Barely edible, but not to be repeated. Thanx anyway cindylinn32.
