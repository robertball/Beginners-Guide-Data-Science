This has become a seasonal favorite in my home. It makes a great breakfast treat with coffee. The texture seems odd at first, so odd that you have to keep eating it until suddenly you realize you've eaten half the pan and you still want more! I add 1 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice, which seems to cut the sweetness a touch and make it even more like pumpkin pie and spice cake had a delicious, gooey baby.

Call it Mochi. Call it cake. Call it whatever you want, just as long as you save me a big ol' hunk of it. I just made this on a whim to see if it might be something to have on Thursday and couldn't be more pleased with how it turned out. Delicious!

It was really good. Kinda like eating a cake only it was mochi-like-chewy. I would call it cake rather than mochi though. But overall great!!!

my friend makes a similar mochi cake with cherry pie filling, which is amazing.  i wanted to do this holiday version for thanksgiving, but used a little less sugar (~1 3/4 c.) and a little more vanilla (~2 1/2 tsp).  i added ~3/4 of the pie filling to the batter before pouring it into the pan, but spooned the rest on top & ran a plastic knife back & forth to create a marbleized look.    i also cut the cake into 48 little squares & served them in cupcake papers (the way my friend does w/ the cherry mochi).  it's a pretty dense cake & esp at thanksgiving w/ so many desserts available, you only need a little bite (you can always get seconds!)    it turned out really well & next time i'd just leave it in the oven for 5 more min to let the pumpkin on top set a little more.

When it first comes out of the oven and it's still warm, you won't think it's mochi at all, but just gooey cake......delicious, yes, but not very mochi-like. well give it lots of time to cool off, and it'll reach a much more mochi-like texture. not exactly like mochi but very close and very tasty!!!

This is excellent.  I healthified it in a few ways- used half splenda, egg whites, and applesauce (1 cup for a half recipe) with 1 tbsp of butter.  Still turned out moist and delicious, my Korean husband was quite impressed.

I wasn't quit sure what to expect, and this was ok. I had mochiko I wanted to use up and came across this recipe. It's fairly easy to make. I did improvise because I only had a 15 oz can of pumpkin, so I used applesauce with it to make up for the difference. Also, I used oil instead of butter because I didn't have enough of that either. Maybe it would've been better if I had stuck to the original recipe.

This was fun and different.  I wouldn't call it mochi though, it was basically just a cake.  But good.

This recipe is great, however it is missing the spices!  Just add 1 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice and 1/2 tsp cinnamon and it it is just right.  Also - the Mochiko flour is exactly how much is in one 16 oz box--no need to measure it out!  And finally-just in case you are concerned about gluten, sweet, glutenous rice flour (like Mochiko) doesn't actually have any gluten in it--it's gluten free!  I hope you enjoy these Hawaiian thanksgiving treats!

Great recipe. It tastes like fluffy, slightly chewy, bread.  I don't taste as much pumpkin as I had expected, but that's not the recipe's fault.  It tastes fairly light for all that sugar included in the recipe!  I would recommend watching the baking time.  Although I did 9 servings instead of the recipe's 12, only 15-20 minutes passed before it started slightly burning (btw it tastes better when its brown)- it doesn't taste burnt, its just more chewy.

Out of this world. Everyone who tries this just loves it. I've made it twice. The second time the only thing I changed was I halved the recipe in an 8x8 pan. I thought because I was making a half batch that I could just halve the baking time. Not so. It still took nearly an hour to bake (50 minutes). I used glass pans both times and didn't grease them. I didn't have a problem with the mochi sticking. Try this, it's unique and amazing!

It looked and smelled like Fall when it came out of the oven--beautiful brown, cake-looking and smelling of spices of a pumpkin pie, with nice crisp edges!  I was afraid of the gooey mochi, but baking it at the right temperature made it the perfect consistency.  A great twist on a pumpkin recipe.  I will be bringing this to holiday parties this year!

I had never heard of this but needed something to bring to a Japan-themed potluck. It was like a very moist cake. I don't know if I would make it for fun but for a themed dinner it was excellent. They only change I made was to use about half the amount of butter called for because it was all I had. It turned out beautifully regardless so if you want to reduce the fat go ahead and cut down the butter. I did really like the pumpkin aspect of it. Make sure you bake it till it's not jiggly or it comes out kinda gooey and oddly textured.

First, I want to say that my attempt at making this was a super fail, yet it turned out really nicely anyway.  I bought the wrong size pumpkin can, 15 instead of 29, then I added a cup of water instead of a cup of butter. I lowered the sugar amount too but that was intentional.  Still very delicious!

I've made this many times over the last few years, but this most recent time I wanted to see what happened if I kept the measurements of everything the same as posted except using half the butter (1/2 cup) and half the sugar (1 cup). It came out as well as always! Absolutely delicious.

Made this recipe for a weekend tailgate and a brunch, and it was a big hit. For those who have never had mochi before, the texture is interesting enough to prompt a lot of discussion but not so interesting that it becomes unpalatable. The only changes that I made was to use half splenda and half sugar, and I used two 15 oz cans of pumpkin puree so there was ever-so-slightly more pumpkin than the recipe called for. It was truly delicious. However, I did have some serious tummy troubles the week after consuming a good amount of the mochi... I don't want to blame it, necessarily, but I am a little worried that the glutionous rice flour could've been culpable.

Yum!!  Everyone went crazy about this at Thanksgiving.  Delicious.  I made cinnamon ice cream which was the perfect accompaniment.

The only change I'd make would be to decrease baking time.  Start paying close attention to yours about halfway through.

I grew up eating butter mochi. This tasted the same for me. I couldn't taste the pumpkin in this, maybe adding the pumpkin spice as another reviewer states or cinnamon if you're looking for a pumpkin pie taste. It was still good though.

This recipe was marvelous. I used Splenda instead of white sugar (to "light"en it up a little) and it worked out perfectly, a nice crisp on the outside and a moist gooey center. This cake recipe is a definite keeper.

This was a surprising delight! It's very much like Butter Mochi with the added flavor of pumpkin. I will be making this recipe more than the traditional butter mochi in the future. It is a great recipe for any time of year!

Really liked the recipe- quick and easy. I have made this a few times and found that different pumpkin purees gave me different flavors. The can I purchased at Trader Joes was the most subtle flavored (I had to use some pumpkin seasoning to amp it up a bit). Overall- this remains a favorite in the house.

Made this twice in the past two days! Easy and yummy! I did sub canned yams for the pumpkin purée and had to break down the yams to a smooth consistency, but it worked out fine. Thank you!

Very good but WAY TOO SICKENLY SWEET. I used evaporated milk instead of condensed milk and 1/2-ed the sugar and still too sweet.

I would sub for evaporated milk and use 1/4 sugar next time.

Fantastic - this is my go-to recipe! I add the 1 tsp of pumpkin spice as some have suggested and cut back on the sugar a little.  All my friends and coworkers request I make this for parties - total winner!

5 stars for texture and rave reviews from the majority of my family. As for flavor, the caramel essence from the condensed milk overpowered the pumpkin flavor, which I didn't expect. I will replace the milk with something else next time.

This turned out so good and perfect in the morning with a cup of coffee. I was expecting the texture to be chewy like mochi but instead it turned out light and airy like a sponge cake.  Next time I'll probably decrease the sugar by a 1/4 of a cup because I prefer it to be less sweet, and add a teaspoon or two of pumpkin pie spice since the pumpkin taste in cake is very subtle.  Otherwise delicious and very easy to make.

I make Mochi all the time but this is the first time I made this pumpkin recipe. It was a hit with my family (they devour all the mocha I make anyway) but they really liked the pumpkin. I will be making this often and my son is going to be trying his hand at this recipe also.

This was really good. Added about a t. of salt and some lemon zest. Also made with pumpkin spice for a GF Thanksgiving alternative to pie. I made a lemon glaze to drizzle over it. SUPER tasty that way!!

This is a great recipe and for an entire large can of pumkin inside of it, you only get a hint of pumpkin.  I followed the entire recipe,  cut it into 24 squares and brought it to work.  It was wiped out with a colleague stating he only got 1 piece!

It was really good.  Since I don't use white flour for any baking this worked well. I substituted 4 eggs for flax eggs and only used 2 cups of flour.  I substituted the other half with 1/4 cup of coconut flour.  Very most and tasty, girl at work said "oh my God this is so good".

We couldn't find glutinous rice flour and had to use brown rice flour.  My husband, who has had real mochi in the past, said it should be more gelatinous and less cake-y, but we are pretty sure using the incorrect flour accounts for that.  Otherwise, this was quite a tasty treat.  For us, it had the consistency of cornbread and the taste of a pumpkin bar.  We ate some last night and I'm tempted to have some for breakfast!  We will probably try harder to find the correct flour before making again - I'd like to try this again.

Hubby and I love mochi -- Hawaii-style mochi, that is, which is sweeter and richer than classic Japanese style mochi.  I'm sensitive to gluten and corn, so it's a safe dessert for me.  I had a pumpkin mochi recipe years ago but lost it, so I was happy to find this one.  When I made it, I added pumpkin pie spices, which made it exactly like the one I remember.  Delicious.

I love making this during the fall season when there are tons of various kinds of pumpkin and pumpkin like vegetables? laying around. I like using fresh pumpkins or squash to make 'em. At first people are apprehensive about the funky little things, but usually once they start eating they don't stop until they realize it's all gone. I usually bake them in cupcake tins as well, so they come out already bite sized and ready to serve. Happy cooking all!

Made this for Thanksgiving and everyone really enjoyed it. Though it was a bit too sweet for me. But it became less sweet after I let the leftovers sit in the frig overnight. Will probably try using half the amount of sugar or maybe substitute something else for the sweetened condensed milk. Still a very tasty treat. I'm going to adjust the proportions a bit or sub out somethings. Have to wait til I finish what's left of the current batch of mochi before experimenting. :)

I made both a 13x9 and got 9 cupcake size. Used my fresh Thanksgiving Pumkin to make my own fresh pumpkin puree.  Following directions exactly, but the individual size cupcakes,  I cooked 30 minutes only......Quite DELISH, and Quite Simple!  Thanks,  may be my New Thanksgiving Tradition!  ;*)

Pikala, thank you for sharing your recipe!  We lived in Japan for five years and traditionally pounded the mochi every year.  It's a long, arduous and sometimes dangerous tradition.  This five star pumpkin mochi is unbelievably delicious and quick to make. I'm always asked for the recipe and friends here in Hawaii just can't believe how easy it is to make!  Many mahalos and domo arigato!

Made this exactly by the recipe and absolutely loved it. My daughter in law and grand daughter have Celiacs and have to eat gluten free, so I made this for a family gathering.  Everyone loved it and ate it up.  I preferred it chilled, the rest of the family ate it at room temperature.  A little doll up of whipped cream would be nice on top, but no one wanted to wait for the cream to be whipped. I will make this again at Thanksgiving.  I would take this over pumpkin pie.

This recipe is REALLY GOOD!  It's pretty easy to make and tastes like a pumpkin cake with the famous mochi flour consistency!  It is good hot out of the oven or the next day too - as it cools, it gets a bit chewier.  I will definitely make this again! Would love to substitute all that butter for something else, but not sure what...

Saw this in the AllRecipes magazine, and wanted to try it.  Loved it!!  I didn't even realize that I made a mistake by using only a 15oz can of pumpkin puree (instead of 29oz) because it turned out very good! Light and chewy, but not an intense pumpkin flavor. Still yummy! My young son loved it. We ate it for breakfast and snacked on it all day.  Definitely will make again!

Chewy and delicious! Love pumpkin and love mochi; perfect combination. I used less sugar, though, and added the spices I normally use in pumpkin pie (ginger, nutmeg, and cinnamon).

This recipe is wonderful and very easy to follow! I made this for a class project and everyone loved it; I didn't have any to take home with me afterward, which disappointed me since it was so good, but made me very happy at the same time since I'm still a beginner cook. My mom accidentally bought white rice flour instead of the glutinous rice flour, not knowing there was a difference... I made it with the white rice flour and added some cinnamon (not much) and it was still excellent! I'm going to try to make this with the glutinous rice flour as well, of course.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I thought you couldn't combine pumpkin with mochi and make it taste great but this recipe succeeded!!!

I love mochi, and I adore anything pumpkin, so this pumpkin mochi was to die for! Nummy and yummy, with a sticky, gooey center. Perfect!
