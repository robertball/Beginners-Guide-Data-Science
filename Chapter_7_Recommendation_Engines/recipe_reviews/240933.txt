I love the name, love the freezing the blue cheese trick.  I will add more blue cheese next time... I feared too much and they would not be crunchy but they were super super crunchy.

Favorite croutons. They are wonderful as is and do not need any additions. However... I do add some fresh garlic to the butter, even though the chef recommends not doing so. I just like garlic

I halved this recipe.  I had some whole wheat bread that I cubed up. It comes together quickly.  My bleu cheese was a little tacky and clumped up so a little difficult  to incorporate it with the the bread cubes.   I think a white bread or a white whole wheat might have helped the bleu cheese shine through better. Used this as a topper for the roasted parsnips and apple soup. I have leftover croutons that I can use on salads. I would make this again.

I have made these 3 times in the last two weeks!  I LOVE them.  My husband not a huge blue cheese lover thought they were the best croutons he'd ever had.  You won't be disappointed!  Easy to make, too!
