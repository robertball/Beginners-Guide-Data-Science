ANYA:  You made 5 changes to a 6 ingredient recipe, trying to "imitate a jarred dip", said you "don't recommend" this recipe and rated it 3 stars.  Your review encompasses everything that is annoying.  That's exactly why so many people on this site get irate.  Submit your own recipe and rate that one 3 stars; so unfair to the original submitter.
Personally I found this to be a 5 star recipe, but then, I had the common sense to make it as written.
Geez

This dip is a favorite of my husband and two boys. I usually don't keep fresh jalapeno on hand, I usually use one small can diced mild green chilies in place of the jalapenos. I also use homemade taco seasoning dip. My family can make quick work of this dip--it usually dosen't last any longer than 15-20 minutes.

This was delish! I made it just as the recipe was written with the exception of adding grated pepper jack cheese to the been mix. I still added the grated cheese to the top - can't ever have to much cheese!

I have made this recipe five times in like 2 months haha. It's really easy and I ALWAYS make it the night before and pop it in the oven 30 before serving. Very tasty and everyone loves it and asks for the recipe. I never use jalapenos though so I used hot sauce instead. And I use Hambuger meat already cooked to add protein Love this!!!

This was really easy to put together and so good!   It had a lot of flavor and you could make it as mild or spicy as you want depending on the quantity of jalapeno you add to the dish.  It would be fantastic for a crowd.  Thanks for the recipe!

Used non-fat plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream and omitted cream cheese. Used 1 small can of green chiles instead of the jalapeno. I omitted the cheese on top and (tried) to serve it cold without baking. I don't recommend this. The dip had a good spicy flavor, but without baking it wasn't that great (I was trying to imitate the bean dip in the jar-you know the one). Next time I will try baking it and I'm sure it will be much better, especially if I use the ingredients called for!

YUMMY!I have fixed this recipe 3 times, andI plan on fixing it many more.  I subbed 4 oz. can of green chilis for the jalapeno peppers.  (Needed something milder for our family's taste.)  Also,  used 2 16oz. cans of refried beans instead of one 30 oz.  I served with a bowl of salsa, a bowl of quacamole, and  a bowl of sour cream.  And used the "dipper corn chips".  People could scoop up and add additional toppings to suit their taste.  Thanks for the recipe!  OH- this can be so filling, I halfed it once, put in microwave for a quick cook, and it was a nice lunch!

This was so good!  I made it for Superbowl Sunday and my husband loved it.  He likes things really hot so I used spicy jalapeno refried beans.  Delicious!

I'm surprised more people have tried this.  Super easy, and delicious. It is very rich with the cream cheese, but everyone at the football party liked it.  We had quite a bit leftover (you could easily halve this), and the leftovers were great in bean burritos for lunch.  I did sub a can of green chilis for the jalapeno.  Yum!

This recipe was delicious and super easy to make. I prepared it the night before and just popped it into the oven before my guests arrived. Everyone loved it! I left out the jalapeños though since I knew a lot of kids would be sampling it.

I made this dip based on 5-star ratings and the fact I had the ingredients on-hand.  I halved the recipe after adding all ingredients with the exception of cheese and baking. I took the dip to a social and while some attendees said the dip was good; no one went back for seconds and I wasn't asked for recipe.  I brought half of the dip home. (Remember, I only took half of the recipe.)  The next day I mixed the half I did not use with picante sauce.  While somewhat more tasty, I will not make/serve this dip again.

This was delicious!  I did not mix the jalapenos in. Rather I baked it for 20 minutes then added the cheese and jalapenos on top.  There were 12 people here last night and we devoured it!  Thank you for this great recipe :-)

Best spicy bean dip recipe ever!!! I have made it with fresh jalapeño peppers straight from the garden. Only thing I changed was using less cheese at the end. All that cheese not needed. Thanks!!

So easy so good. I did not put in the jalapeno though cause there was alot of children at the dinner. The kids even the really young ones loved this dip ! I served it with Fritos. I had no left overs.

Made a double quantity thank goodness, for a pot luck. Barely enough for
a snack left! Great hit.
