Our family really enjoyed this recipe.  I did however add poultry seasoning and sauted fresh vegetables prior to mixing them with the mixture.  It will end up on our dinner table again!

This is a quick easy meal on those busy days. Just make sure you take out the forzen vegetables ahead a time. Or soak the vegetables in warm water to unthaw them. I used a box of Stove Top Stuffing and I topped the casserole with swiss cheese.  All good!

I made this using 16oz frozen broccoli pieces (defrost / cooked in microwave), but in addition I also added 1/2c sliced steamed fresh carrots; & 1/2c each chopped yellow onion and celery saute in butter. Also added 1/3c dried cranberries & 1/2c almond slivers (for crunch!). Instead of adding milk, I used the water drained from the broccoli and 2 cans of cr. of mushroom soup. We made a casserole AND 4 smaller single-serving ramekin dishes for taking to work.   My family really enjoys this.

This is easy to make which I really like since I am sometimes too busy to spend time prepping food.  It has a good flavor, but needs a little seasoning.  It leaves room for variation, I will next time add potatoes, celery, and some other veggies.  I will also use an extra can of cream of mush, I like it a little more creamy.

You have to add 2 cans of soup and 2 cups of milk to this dish and then it is not dry.  We added peas, corn,fresh garlic (2) finely chopping cooking onion, sea salt and fresh pepper and last basil to this along with already cooked stuffing. Then once cooked for 20 min. make sure you cook egg noodles on the side and power over noodles.  total supper.

Very dry. This casserole needs more liquid. I poured leftover turkey gravy over this after it was baked. That added the moisture and zip it needed. Next time I will either add another can of soup or only add two cups of stuffing mix.

Four stars as written, but it ratchets up to five if you just double the soup and the milk - otherwise it's really a bit too dry. Also, you can substitute chicken broth for the milk/water in the recipe. Add some seasoning to this dish and it gets even better! I used some poultry seasoning, parsley, and fresh ground pepper and it was a tasty, hearty, filling meal for my family.

We loved this.  I like that the stuffing is still a little tiny bit firm (not gooey at all) but mostly soft.  We used fresh broccoli and carrots that I steamed in the microwave before putting them in.  Very easy meal and very tasty!

This recipe was a hit with my husband and three kids!  I called it a turkey and crouton casserole and even my 4 yr old stuffing hater loved it! I was generous with the turkey, I used frozen broccoli and cauliflower which I thawed in the microwave, and I added 1/2 cup of chicken broth because it looked dry.  (That's the reason for only four stars) I didn't bother baking the cheese on separately, and it was gobbled up! I served it with cranberries on the side.  I will definitely make this again!
