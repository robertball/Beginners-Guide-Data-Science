I have made this dip several times in the last few months and it is one of the best ive ever had. I did make a couple of changes and additions to it to suit my tastes... and I have literally been asked to make at least 8 copies of this recipe from friends, co-workers and family.
I had read from previous reviews that it had a tendacy to turn out watery, so I added between 6-8 oz of cream cheese to thicken it up. I also added 1 fresh jalepeno pepper and a handful of radishes for texture.. I also tripled or more the cilantro called for.
When this is refridgerated it thickens up nicely due to the cream cheese.
I started using this on St. Patrick's day for a party when I needed to bring a green appetizer and served it with guacamole green corn chips and breaded, fried asparagus pieces...
Since I have brought it to work for "dip day" several times and made it at home. It has become a hit already and EVERYONE wants the recipe and loves it!!!

I really thought this was a little bland, and my friends and I didn't care for the consistency. It wasn't creamy like real guacamole, it could maybe be called asaragus salsa, ours came out watery. I thought it would get better with age but the asparagus flavor overpowered everything after a day. Won't make again.

quick, easy.  I loved the idea of microwaving also...as a matter of fact, I think that I will no longer steam asparagus but just throw it in the micro.  I had some good chipotle salsa.  Added red onion for color instead of green.  This is a nice change of pace.  I kept it more chunky to eat more as a sidedish.  Only added some salt and a little lime juice.  The chipotle was a very hot salsa so didn't need any more heat factor.  Maybe the key is to use a better salsa.

Oh, my!  This was a random recipe search when I had asparagus I forgot to make for Easter (!), and wanted to make something different... I added cream cheese as another reviewer suggested, and I didn't refrigerate, just ate it warm.  It was fantastic. We are guacamole fanatics, and I must say this was super.  I don't give 5 stars too often!

WOW!  I LOVE it!!! I just ate half of it warm because I couldn't stop long enough to let it chill! We're big guacamole fans and I make it often, but this is just the sort of change my taste buds needed!  I made several changes, but kept the basics of the recipe- I didn't have any salsa left, so I just used a half a medium tomato, a dash of vinegar, and the juice of half a lime to cover the salsa flavors.  I also added some ground sea salt and some ground cayenne pepper.  I omitted the garlic.  And, as I typically do with my own guac recipe, I added a small squirt of honey.  But I did taste it before I made all those changes and I still LOVED it!  You can hardly even tell that it's asparagus- which my husband is a fan of (since he's not usually a fan of asparagus).  Awesome! Perfect with chips and a cold beer! I can't wait to serve this to guests!

I really liked this recipe. It turned out to be a very light tasteful dip. I added some extra spices such as black pepper, red pepper, hot sauce and then tomatoes. It may be great with some fat-free sour cream as well.

I just made this and thought it was wonderful.  I did make a few adjustments.  I add a good tablespoon of freshly chopped cilantra.  I added atleast a cup of salsa.  I pureed my asparagus to get more of a guacamole texture.  I also added about a tsp of scorned woman (super hot, hot sauce).  To give it a little bite.  Normally, I only use a drop of that stuff.   I got my husband and kids to eat this.  NO ONE could guess what the main ingredient was so I DIDNT tell them!!!

This was quite good. It had all the flavor of guacamole, minus the creaminess of the avocados. I do prefer regular guacamole, but my girlfriend and I made this for a party and it went over quite well. Also, I suggest using a blue corn tortilla, or any tortilla with a bit more flavor. The standard tortillas do get a bit buried under the flavor of this guacamole.

I wouldn't say that this is "guacamole" as much as a good way to hide asparagus when you're tired of it or people don't like it.  I didn't think it was spicy enough either, so added red and banana peppers as well as chili powder and crushed red pepper.  It was much more to my liking that way.  I thought it was a really inventive way to use up some asparagus!

I made this recipe for the fact that we had asparagus in the garden and I love guacamole. I also just happened to be making my own salsa that day which I added to the recipe. I took the advice to add cream cheese. I served this for an appetizer for dinner and the kids were disgusted that we would make guac without avacado. The bowl was devoured in 30 min. Need I say that it was a hit. My boyfriend just asked me to make more.....please!!!

I love and have fresh asparagus in my garden, what better way to enjoy my favorite Mexican dish with a fraction of the fat and calories! I added a little lime juice, a few TBS of cream cheese and upped the cilantro - amazing!

Very good! I found the garlic to be a bit overwhelming, but this recipe is tasty and creative. I added a bit of lime juice and used more cilantro than called for. Thanks! :)

I boiled the asparagus and while it was perfectly cooked, my puree was very watery. I added 1 1/2 tbsp neufchatel and it turned out wonderful!

This is such a lower fat option from regular guacamole! I made a few changes to original recipe.   I used "Big Y" grocery store "Cilantro salsa", I used a complete bunch of Cilantro, skipped the garlic as salsa had it in it.  I added  a little avocado instead of cream cheese to help the consistency that another reviewer suggested and it kept the fats healthy.  People raved about this recipe at the super-bowl party.

Lot of great reviews and suggestions, but i prefer to eat my asparagus as asparagus, and my guacamole made traditionally with avocados, fat and all.  I just really didn't care for the texture (not creamy) with the asparagus.  i felt like i wasted what could have been a yummy bowl of cooked asparagus.

This is a great recipe.  It is amazing how much asparagus it takes to make a bowl full of guacamole.  I totally faked out my 15 year old daughter, she had no idea it wasn't avocado.  I might try adding some low fat sour cream next time.  I used lime, cilantro, dried hot red pepper, diced tomato, chopped onion, and salt.

Just made this and it is pretty great.  After reading the reviews, I did add 2 tbsp fat free cream cheese, and I also added 2 tbsp fat free mayo (we're on a diet).  I think I should have added the cream cheese and fat free sour cream instead.  We also added jalapenos for spice.  I would say go heavy on the garlic, cilantro, and spice as it can be a little bland.  It isn't like avacado guacamole, but we used it as a spread on a veggie sandwhich and it was quite similar!

This recipe is good and resembles guacamole, but it is pretty far from the real deal.  I stuck with the recipe, and it came out pretty good. Add salt for taste, and use thick salsa so that it does not come out watery.  I think that adding cream cheese would definitely help the texture.

This was a great recipe. I used a little chipotle salsa with the regular salsa and the flavor was excellent. I'm sure if you wanted it creamy like some guacamole adding sour cream would work. I boiled the asparagus for about 6 minutes.

I liked this but the recipe needs to be tweaked. I followed others advice and added low fat cream cheese.  I will add more next time.  I also added some saracha for heat.  I didn't have salsa so I improvised, having salsa may improve the flavors as well.

This is great!  I will definitely make this again.  I used 12 oz. frozen asparagus, no green onions, and a generous amount of Adobo (salt/white pepper/oregano seasoning).  but I think I will be a little more conservative with the garlic next time.  Maybe press only 1 clove, then taste and add another if needed.  Its really a very good substitute for guacamole. Ole! Yume!

This did not have the taste or creaminess of guac.  I normally like asparagus, but I did not care for this at all.

The flavor was decent, but it was watery and not my favorite. I wouldnt make this again, none of my family really enjoyed it either and I ended up tossing it.

I just threw in steamed asparagus and some salsa in my FP, that's it. Super easy and tasty. Can't wait to try it out on my kids!

This was an amazing recipe! I made it for a dinner party I was having and it was gone way before dinner was ready! They all asked me if there was any more and for the recipe. I finally have something I can share with my vegan boss too. She's gonna love it!!!!!

I didn't measure anything and I'm not sure if I made a mistake, but mine came out as more of a pico de gallo. I would still make it again because it sounds intriguing with company, but I'd try different flavors of salsa to add find the best complimentary one. I have only tried with a medium heat  chunky salsa with cilantro

I would have used one avacado, and I reccomend adding a lime or lemon to spruce it up. It was super easy, I liked that.

I made it without the cilantro, because I don't have any, and it was bland.  Then I added 4 oz of cream cheese, 1 teaspoon of taco seasoning, a little hot sauce, and an extra 1/2 cup of salsa.  It was very good!  (The cream cheese was a suggestion from a previous reviewer.)
