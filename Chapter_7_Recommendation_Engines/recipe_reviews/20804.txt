Creamy and thick. My kids loved the "yogurt drink" as they called it.  It is quite filling so I halved the recipe and then divided it up between the 3 kids.  They were all slurping the bottom of the cup with their straws and asking if they can have one tomorrow too!

I really liked this. I didn't have any plain yogurt so I used strawberry and it was really good!  My 3 yr old and 10 mo. old loved it as well. Nutritional AND tasty!

I think it's important that you realize it's going to have a strong yogurt taste as that is a key ingredient to this shake. It's more smoothie-like to me, but I still think it's good. I've played around with this recipe and found that the best variation for our tastes is: 2 bananas (we love 'em in this family), 1 cup milk, 1 cup yogurt, and 4 TBSP sugar. It is perfectly sweet and tart- like a banana smoothie/shake should be. I omitted the lemon juice simply because I was out, haha. Anyways, I think it's a great recipe that can be varied using whatever fruit you happen to love and still be completely tasty and good for you! 5 stars from me and my family! :)

Very easy and tasty. I used blueberry yogurt and reduced the sugar to only 1 tablespoon. Very filling.

Maybe the trick to making this drinkable is using flavored yogurt. I made this following the recipe and the only flavor I could taste was the nasty sour/tart flavor of the lemon juice and plain yogurt. Not good, not even a little.

I used some frozen mashed banana that I had in my freezer, skim milk, and fat free yogurt. I didn't put the whipped cream on the top and it still tasted great! Next time I may try honey in place of the sugar.

This is the exact recipe i was looking for.  I didn't use lemon juice.  I used Splenda instead of sugar.  I also used one whole banana and halved the rest of the ingredients for one serving that was a little thicker than orginal recipe.  update- I threw in three strawberries and used a small banana.  It tasted great.

This is an excellent drink as is, though I like to blend in a few ice cubes to make it frothier.  I've made it many times, sometimes making substitutions (e.g. sour cream instead of yogurt, honey instead of sugar, OJ instead of lemon juice) just to use what I had on hand, and it tastes just as well.

Overall good taste, but I thought it was VERY sweet.  Could be because I had overripe bananas.  My almost 2 year old didn't care for it, possibly because of the sweetness.  He likes plain yogurt by itself, so he may not be the best judge for children's tastes

To make this recipe work for one person, I mimicked user mshcooks by blending the following: 1 banana, 1/4 cup of vanilla yogurt, 1/4 cup of skim milk, and 1 tablespoon of sugar. I poured it over a glass filled with ice, and it's delicious!

This was good, although it should be called a smoothie instead of a shake. I exchanged vanilla extract for the lemon juice, and added cinnamon, nutmeg, and 1tbsp peanut butter. I also added a few ice cubes. With these changes it was delicious!

I used two bananas, omitted the lemon juice, sugar and whipped cream, and the shake turned out GREAT! The ingredients compliment one another perfectly. The recipe yields two large cups, approximately.

I needed a recipe for what I had on hand- bananas, yogurt, soymilk.  I used one banana, 1/4 cup plain soymilk, 1/4 cup vanilla yogurt, and 1 Tbsp sugar.  This made one thick serving, which was all I wanted.  The person who originally made this recipe must like sweet/sour; I prefer sweeter, and ommitted the lemon juice.

The taste was good but it was indeed very runny.  Next time, I will add some flax seeds and more ice.  Kids liked it.

Very good recipe. I added vanilla extract instead of lemon juice, but will definitely try it next time, along with an extra banana...

I didn't have any plain yogurt so I used Greek plain yogurt. It turned out a bit thick but otherwise good.

After reading the ingredients I knew this would be somewhat bland and thin. First I halved the recipe, then tasted and with modifications rated it a 4. I added  1 handful of ice-crushed, 1/2 c. of plain yogurt ( and used less milk) ,  1 teasp. of ground flaxseed, the entire banana (instead of half when recipe was halved), organic agave (instead of white sugar) and 1/2 scoop of vanilla soy protein powder.  The protein powder and flaxseed really thicken this up to actually make it a "shake".
