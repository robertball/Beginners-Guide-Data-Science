Decent side dish. Enjoyed it, but it didn't take center stage. A little too much flour for only two potatoes. Try 1/8 cup or more potatoes. Also, try a little chili powder instead of mustard powder and then have a selection of mustards on the side for dipping (that's the way I like it).

We really loved this recipe! We made it one week and then again the following! 

I did cut down a bit on the amount of flour and I substituted the mustard powder for cayenne pepper. I also added about 2 teaspoons of sugar. 

Fantastic!

My husband & kids ate these sweet potatoes, which is saying a lot.  I agree with another reviewer who suggested using chili powder instead of the dry mustard.  I'm not a fan of the dry mustard in this particular recipe.  Cumin + a little sugar is a good twist, too.

Tip for crisp potatoes without turning - I put the potatoes on a cooling rack on my baking sheet when cooking to allow it to crisp up on all sides.  The recipe ingredients were perfect, the only thing that needed changing was the method of preparation.  I lightly tossed the potatoes with oil then added to ziploc of spices.  After tossing I put on a cooling rack placed in a jellyroll pan lined with foil.  I didn't have any trouble with too much flour as other reviewers did -- probably because I tossed with oil first.  Next time I might try adding some melted butter when tossing with the oil for a yummier, though unhealthier version!

The potatoes didn't get brown unless you turned them.  A since they were cut into wedges you could not get all sides brown.  I even tried brushing with oil.  Next time I will season the oil, omit the flour and cut into slices and turn half way through.

I was not thrilled with these. They tasted very bland.  Too much pepper. Maybe try them in a pan instead of in the oven. I don't think I would try this one again.

These were pretty good. I think that you could use less flour. I enjoyed the paprika and mustard flavors together. I used 2 sweet potatoes and 2 parsnips, which worked nicely. The texture was nice, too.

I come from NZ too (now live in Australia). I used real kumara not the orange sweet potato. Used less flour,1 heaped Tbsp. The mustard complemented the sweetness of the Kumara. Thanks Nikki, a taste from the past.

wow, I have to say, these were the worst things that has come out of my kitchen in a while. not sure exactly what went wrong, but they didn't brown and they tasted very bland; all around super disappointing. I won't give it just one star because I'm sure part of the failure was my fault. ;)

I was a little disappointed in these as written. They didn't really crisp or brown like I was hoping they would, and the flour mixture kind of just clumped on them in an unappetizing way. They weren't at all horrible - we ate them gladly, but I wouldn't bother making them this way again. Thanks anyway!

Not bad but next time I will toss them in olive or vegetable oil after putting them in the flour mixture with less flour as suggested in other reviews.

Great alternative side dish!  Lots of flavor and balanced sweetness.  I usually don't like sweet potatoes because the preparations are always too sweet for dinner time.  I scaled back on the flour (1T), added a 1/4t chili powder, and a heavy pinch of kosher salt.  I also tossed the potatoes on the sheet after the first 10 min of cook time to give them a little roll in the oil.  Serving these with a dollop of plain greek yogurt is a great alternative to sour cream.  Big hit at my table!!

Very nice flavor.  I like the mustard powder.  I halved the recipe but kept the same amount of spices except the flour--I used about 1 or 2 tablespoons of flour and added some crushed red pepper.  Worked very well.  I baked them for about 1 hour and flipped the sweet potatoes at 30 minutes.  Still, I made big wedges so if the recipe meant small wedges they would've been done sooner.  Bf and I ate these plain; no dipping sauces or sour cream needed and we enjoyed them very much.  Thanks for the recipe!

Loved these!! I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and forgot to add the flour but it turned out fine in my opinion. Served with a bit of sour cream on the side, and it was a hit!

After reading reviews, I made this recipe as directed, but dotted with butter.  The flour came out brown and crispy.  I would make this again.  But don't forget to dot the butter.  Otherwise the flour doesn't brown.

I used 2 sweet potatoes and 3 turnips.  It worked well but decided I'm not a fan of turnips.  I liked the sweet potatoes.  The amount of flour was perfect for this amount of food.

Didn't want the oven temp that high as I was reheating some BBQ Pork so I parboiled the sweet potato for about 15 minutes, sliced it, sprinkled with the mustard, paprika, pepper and salt, drizzled with olive oil and baked for about 20 minutes at 350 degrees. The slices weren't crispy without the flour, but even so it was a tasty side dish.

I should have followed the reviews and decreased the amount of flour. DRASTICALLY. Ugh. I used a little cumin, a little curry powder, a little chili powder and some salt. The spices were nice with the potatoes but there was definitely too much flour. I'll try again with little (or even no) flour, maybe.

I really enjoyed this recipe and I'm not a fan of sweet potatoes. Made it for my in-laws and 1/3 of the wedges didn't even make it to the table they liked it so much. But I did switch the dry mustard for chili powder and added 2 tblsp brown sugar

This is an awesome recipe, but I , personally,  preferred to bake with no seasoning and serving with BBQ sauce. I did this it this way the first time, however, and did enjoy it! Just skips a step without seasoning. BBQ does it all.

These are great! I cook them all the time, but be careful not to overcoat (a light dusting will do) otherwise the flour doesn't cook and you get dusty potato wedges.

Delicious! We followed the recipe exactly, and didn't feel they needed any sauce for dipping. Even the child that doesn't like sweet potatoes loved this one. Thank you for the recipe!

Very good! I can't stop eating them. These will be a great appetizer for my next get together. I did follow the advice of one other reviewer and spray (coat)with (olive) oil prior to shaking in a bag and they came out perfectly coated. I had to cook mine for closer to an hour for the thicker pieces, so be sure to check for doneness. Also, I tried dipping in dijon mustard, YUM! Great recipe, thanks!

Skipped the flour, went with chili powder instead of mustard. Ended up with a simple savory potato, very tender. It didn't overpower anything else on the plate and let the strong flavors from the other items stand out. I'll try it with the mustard next time instead.
