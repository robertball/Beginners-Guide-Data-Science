These were really tasty treats! I used cream cheese instead of cheddar. I used HOT sausage. They were excellant reheated for a quick snack the next day.My kids of course would not go near them. Make sure that you have plenty to drink!

This recipe was delicious.  I brought it to work for a Goodie Day and everyone
loved it.  I did use mild jalapenos so that even those who don't like spicy food
could enjoy it.  The only thing I had a problem with is that I could only use a
half jalapeno for each "egg," a whole jalapeno wouldn't get wrapped.

I made these for a church reception - I used the mild canned green chilies instead of jalapenos. They were a hit.   The next time I make them for me, I'm going to add pepper jack to the green chilies to spice it up a little, but not too hot

Maybe using fresh jalapeno's would enhance these?  I was looking for a little more bang.

If you are looking to spice this up....try browning sausage links, put link and pepper jack cheese inside cleaned pepper, wrap the "egg" in a croissant instead of biscuit.  It is a lot spicer, so some may want to mix the cheese half and half.

Tasty! I did wrap them in crescent dough, but that was my only change. I think these would be even better w/ some cream cheese and spices mixed in with the cheddar, so I may have to try that. Of course, the guys really, REALLY liked these, so I will def be making them again! Thanks for sharing. :)

These took quite a bit of work for a just ok dish - my opinion,of course.  I used fresh & baked half an hour.
