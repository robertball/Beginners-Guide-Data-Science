These are delicious! I used kalamata olives, which aren't called for here but that's what I had. Surprisingly, the olives didn't overpower the seasonings & after sitting at room temp for about an hour, the flavors just melded together. Wonderful recipe & next time I'll use the olives that are specified. Nice job:o)

Loved these olives and it took no time to make. The green cerignolas olives were especially good.  Thanks for sharing MIZDIZ.

These nibbles are fantastic!  Made them (along with several other munchies) for a weekend cocktail party and these were the first to go!  Try them, you won't be disappointed!

They are ok, I don't think I liked the mixture of olives and orange juice. They would have been better without the juice for me. Thank you for sharing!

If you like olives this is a quick appetizer. Pretty high in salt so I rinsed the olives and let them sit in cold water a bit. Next time Iâ€™ll mix the Kalimantan

Soo Good!  I used one can each green, black, and kalamata olives with a semi-sweet wine and only 1 T olive oil.  They get even better after sitting a few days.

What an awesome make-ahead party nibble! They're delicious, they're super-easy, and they go with any Mediterranean cuisine! I've tried them twice. The first time, I followed the recipe exactly and they were perfect. If you have time, that's definitely the way to go. The second time, I had only a few moments to throw something together the night before a family gathering, so I just threw everything in a sealed jar, shook it a few times, and let it soak in the fridge overnight. They weren't as good as the cooked version, but it was still tasty. You do need to increase the liquids if you're going to do it this way, though.
