Sounds great! Being a diabetic, I do something very similar: cup of almond milk; scoop of protein powder (low-carb); a splash of black coffee; 1/2 Tbs of pure Stevia; AND add BIG Tbs of organic Peanut Butter (low-carb). I have used oats before too. I used 6-8 ice cubes. I blend it smooooth with my Vitamix. Delicious. I call it my Power Smoothie (low-carb) as well! :-)

My son loved it.

I thought this was very good. I pulverized my oats in the blender before adding the rest of the ingredients. I used only 1 cup milk and added 1 packet of Truvia. Will make again.

It was great! The second time I made it I added a couple of dashes of cinnamon. It turned out really good also, just a tip for cinnamon lovers.

I used a packet of Starbucks Via Coffee and needed to add just a little sweetener, but this was easy, delicious, and quick to make.
