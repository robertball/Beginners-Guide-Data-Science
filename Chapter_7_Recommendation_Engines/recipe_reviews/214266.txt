I skipped pineapple, for gelatin I used unsweetened strawberry jello and for the cup of ice cubes I only used the juice from the strawberries, Delicious! will make with other fruits too.

Delicious!  People tore through this pie and were disappointed that there wasn't more!  Excellent!  They said the best thing about it was that it wasn't overly sweet.  I mashed an extra cup of strawberries to add texture so the glaze wouldn't look so "Jello-y."  I also added 11 more crushed wafers (25% more) and 1 tbsp. butter to make the crust thicker.  A big hit!  Thanks!
