The recipe "as is" is good, but you notice sweet first and taste second (not ideal). I added another Tbsp of butter (total of 1/4 cup) and a dash more of milk, and 1/2 tsp of vanilla - the flavor was so much better and more rich (less pure sugar taste). We really enjoyed this recipe with those tweaks.
On another note, DON'T let it boil - the texture becomes grainy (I unwisely thought I could do dishes AND stir occasionaly... but out of sight, out of mind. The flavor was still great, though, and we'll make this again)
Thank for the recipe :)

Very good, but follow instructions exactly!  If you let it boil, it gets gritty.  Also, I added a little vanilla, but it tasted better without it - does not need vanilla, nor salt!  An extra tablespoon of butter does not hurt, however.  I made it a second time using margarine, and that worked well, too.

Very easy and wonderful.  Cook a little while on low until sugar disolves for best results.

I used honey for the corn syrup, just because we didn't have any. My kids loved it on vanilla icecream. My son insists we keep this recipe forever.

This is a very thin sauce. I cut back the milk to 1/8 cup and did not boil.  Paired it with the Super Duper Easy Apple Cake recipe.

This turned out to be quite wonderful....I had never made my own Butterscotch sauce....my kids really enjoyed it very much. It was hard not to boil it, but I just kept stirring until it thickened like I thought it should. It had a wonderful buttery taste to it. All I had was unsalted butter, so it took longer for it to melt down, but man did it look great, smell great, and it was still warm when I topped the ice cream. Thanks

Yummy & easy! For a less sweet version I used 3/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup milk and add 2 tsp cornstarch (to make it thicker).

Yum!  Just beware: if you are looking for a sauce that is thick and syrupy, this isn't it.  It's quite liquidy.

Very simple to do, but tastes more like a thin caramel sauce to me than butterscotch. Still, it is very tasty.  I followed the directions precisely, tasted it, and then at the end added a pinch of salt and a splash of vanilla. Used for a drizzle over pound cake. Will make again. Thank you!

This is very good and VERY sweet.  I used margarine instead of butter and added an extra tablespoon.  I kept it over the heat for a while after the butter melted until the sugar wasn't grainy anymore, but I was careful not to let it boil.  I tried it over ice cream and popcorn and enjoyed it both ways.  I saw a review saying that this was a very thin sauce.  For me, it was thin when it was hot but it thickened up quite a bit when it cooled.  On ice cream, it behaved more like hot fudge than a syrup.  I think this will be more popular with kids than adults because it's so very sweet.

This is very good. I started putting my ingredients together and realized I didn't have any light corn syrup so I substituted the only thing I had on hand with the same consitancy - maple syrup. I knew that would alter the flavor slightly so I added a tablespoon of Butterschots to counteract plus a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla. Delicious! I'm going to get some corn syrup and try again. One thing to note though...for those who came out with a thin sauce, you didn't cook it long enough. Even though the recipe says to heat until the butter is melted, if you simmer it for 15 or 20 minutes (no boiling) and stir constantly, this turns into a rich sauce that thickens as it cools.

Not as buttery tasting as I was looking for, the flavor got lost on vanilla icecream. Even tried adding another  tb. butter.  Update: Adding a touch of butter flavoring helps with this recipe. I used a combo of brown sugar, white sugar and syrup to make a better color and then followed the recipe as usual. Adding a drop or two of yellow food coloring makes it prettier if you do this. But that's up to you. Remember brown sugar muddles the color but adds richer flavor. However, just adding the butter flavoring helped the most.

YUM.  I added a splash of vanilla and it tastes like a cross between caramel and butterscotch.  It's very thin when it cooks, but thickens up to a nice consistency when it cools.

Yum,yum, yum! Trying to stay out of it while waiting for it to cool. Followed previous reviewers suggestion and added 2 tsp of cornstarch. It thickened it nicely!  Will definitely make this again.

This is a delicious sauce, and is so incredibly easy!!  I was doubtful that it would work because it was so simple, but it was perfect!  I added a pinch of salt, which I though balanced it out nicely, and increased the butter to 4 T.  Yumm!

This is good. The best in the world? Hmm, don't know about that. It's easy to make tho. I also made a hot fudge topping from this site and made sundaes. WOW, they were good and definitely hit the sweet tooth spot!

This is absolutely delicious! I made it with margarine and added a teaspoon of vanilly, but next time I will try butter and leave the vanilla out.  The vanilla changed the flavor away from a true butterscotch taste, but still so yummy.  We ate this on ice cream, toasted english muffins, and in peanut butter (and butterscotch) sandwiches! A very decadent treat!

So easy and made with ingredients on hand.  I used 3 tablespoons butter and 2 tablespoons margarine.  I substituted white sugar for corn syrup, only 2 tablespoons of milk, and added 1/2 teaspoon salt.  Be sure to cook long enough without boiling to fully melt all sugar.  Nice consistency and flavor.

Delicious and easy. For a good dessert that is easy and everyone in my house loved, saute apple slices until just tender(about 1 small apple per person) in a couple of tablespoons of butter, sprinkle with cinnamon and a splash of Grand Marnier. Serve warm over good vanilla ice cream, drizzled with this sauce. Tastes wonderful! thanks for the great recipe!

This is SO delicious. Rather than adding vanilla like some people said, try a couple tablespoons of strong, black, cold coffee to the finished product. Really "enriches" the flavor. Enjoy.

Sweet buttery goodness.  I spooned this over Old Fashioned Apple Dumplings (featured on this site) instead of the white-sugar syrup from that recipe because I wanted something richer.  Thanks!

Good. I changed the recipe a bit. I added some cornflour to thicken it. I used glucose syrup because we didn't have corn syrup. I added some more butter too.

It's a great baseline recipe, which is perfect for me because I like to take a recipe and tweak it to make it my own. I thought it was super sweet as is - I used half and half instead of milk and added about 1/2 cup instead of 1/4; which made it thinner, but brought it to a boil and let it simmer for awhile to thicken. Thanks for sharing!!

Yum, with alterations after reading reviews.  I used 1/4 cup butter, 1/2 tsp vanilla and instead of milk, 1/4 cup of whipping cream.   I followed the rest of the directions and cooked without boiling.  No problems thickening as it cooled.

Use half and half instead of milk and just a pinch of salt really made it!

I wanted a small batch of sauce to drizzle on butter crunch ice cream. I used 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1 1/2 tblsp butter and instead of milk with corn syrup I added 2 large heaping tblsp of ice cream. Melted on medium heat until bubbling. It is thick, creamy and buttery.

Simple and easy, but this is not butterscotch.  It tastes ok for what it is, but no thanks...

Really easy and made it with cream instead of milk. I do prefer caramel sauce since it was more buttery.

A great success. We added 1 tablespoon of butter for extra awesomeness and 1/2 of a sliced jalapeno for a little extra kick! It was delicious over vanilla ice cream. Will definitely make again.

More liquidy than I would have liked.  Good flavor, will try adding vanilla next time as others suggested and perhaps less milk.

So Delicious! And I'm not even a big fan of butterscotch! I did make a little change - I only added 1/8c of milk. Also added 1/2 tsp vanilla - yummy with peaches and ice cream!

It was a good sauce, very sweet.  (Almost too sweet for my taste) I'll probably make again.
