I love this!  This is now my favorite pesto recipe to put up for the year.  To keep pesto; freeze in an ice cube tray, then pop out and store in a ziplock bag in the freezer.  Each ice cube is about an 1/4 cup.  This is fantastic for my grilled pesto chicken.

I had a ton of basil that I needed to use up.  It doesn't tolerate cold at all, so it's streching it to keep it into October in Minnesota.  I was struggling to choose a recipe, so I decided to try three different pesto recipes from this site.  In A-typical allrecipes fashion I actually stuck exactly to each recipe so that we could truly judge them fairly.  The recipes were Easy Pesto by Rebecca Jane Thompson, Pesto Sauce by Sara, and Simple Garlic and Basil Pesto by FuzzyGreenMonkey.  My favorite was Easy Pesto.  It had a nice nutty flavor because of the toasted almonds.  It's also nice if you don't have much basil on hand because it uses half as much as the other recipes.  My husband liked Simple Garlic and Basil Pesto the best, it was my close second.  The parmesan cheese and pine nuts really make that recipe.  We both agreed that by far our least favorite was Pesto Sauce.  It was very bland compared to the other two.  I would attribute that to the 1 1/2 cups of walnuts.  I would not recommend that recipe at all.  It was a fun experiment and the other two recipes will go into my permanant file.

Ditch the chilli power, it just takes away from the flavor.

Toast your pine nuts first, then chop them all in your food processer a bit, but not too much as you want texture. 

I somtimes use walnuts instead of pine nuts, also never use brazil nuts.  Can't tell the difference.  Most any type of hard oily nut will work.

This is perfect. I've already made 8 batches! The chili powder is such a great addition, adding zip but no noticeable flavor. (try adding a few dashes to a tiny spoonful if you're reticent; you'll see!) Less oil has worked fine as well, as well as fewer pine nuts when I was short. I haven't yet, however, used the Brazil nuts. ***TIP: I have heard that pesto should not be frozen with the cheese in it; it makes one of the ingredients rancid. Freeze and add cheese later.***

Due to a big basil sale at the farmers' market this summer and our market had grated parmesean on sale too the same week, my husband and I were called to task for Pesto!  Especially, after his mom gave us about a dozen heads of Italian Red garlic (home grown).  About 12 cups of this pesto by the end. We love it so much!  We didn't have the brasil nuts when we made it during summer (added more pine nuts), but we will this summer.  We added just a pinch of crushed red with the chili powder, and maybe a tiny bit less oil.  SO YUMMY!  I look forward to the sale this coming summer, as our frozen stock of pesto is running out!!  Yes, this does freeze well, but be sure to freeze in small containers or plastic bags, not a giant 2 qt thing I did the first time, then had to thaw and refreeze.  Also, we might a bit of lemon juice next time to help preserve the color, but that's because we are big "make and freeze" fans around thse parts.  =)

I added some seasoned salt and red pepper flakes as I blended.  Very easy to make and a great way to clear out my basil plant, which is going crazy this year. I also toasted the pine nuts first (roll around in a very hot pan until lightly browned on some but not all sides) - intensifies the nutty flavor.  Delicious!

Fantastic! I warmed it and added some heavy cream and served it over gnocchi and it was scrumptious.

A good basic recipe - I added some crushed red pepper in place of chili powder. Also i recommend roasting the pine nuts first, and adding a bit of salt. But DO NOT put this in a blender - it will taste like pureed grass. Chop it fine or use a mortar and pestle - it is worth the extra work.

I made a half a batch of this because my basils are just babies. I omitted the brazilian nuts because I don't have any. Wonderful flavor!!!!

I've make this all the time and keep in on hand. It's very good! I use all pine nuts - toasted first - just a preference and never have brazil nut on hand. I use a pinch of cayenne instead of chili powder. It makes enough to freeze for later. I don't use an ice tray - takes up too much space even if just temporarily. I spoon the rest in the bottom of a quart freezer baggie and fold it over to make a "log". Next time I cut off what I need and put the wrapped "log" back in another baggy in the freezer. It only takes a couple minutes for small amounts to defrost.

Good.  Your average pesto sauce.  I halved the oil because 1 cup seemed like way too much; I'm glad I did. I also didn't use brazil nuts, but made up the difference with more pine nuts.  And I used roasted garlic and was heavy handed with the parmesan.

I thought this was quite good and easy. I've made it twice with different nut combos each time.  Both were good, with no real discernible difference.  I also add a little lemon juice for color preservation and to lift the taste..and a few red pepper flakes, the seocnd time..both batches were good.  For those who thought there was too much oil, it may due to how you measured the basil.  I found that 3 large, tight, fistfuls of whole leaf basil, provides me with 3 generous "chopped" cups.  But, if you measure 3 cups of whole, then chop it, you will get fewer than 3 cups chopped, as chopped food fills a smaller volume than whole. In which case, just use a smaller amount of oil.

I followed the recipe to a T the first time I made this, I did not enjoy the taste of the Brazil nuts and found it extremely oily.  On the second attempt, I omitted the Brazil nuts, used roasted pine nuts, and a lot less oil and found it much better tasting :)  I suggest as others have, to add the parm cheese when ready to serve, otherwise it causes your pesto to spoil faster.  Cheers!

I just made a very similar version of this pesto minus the chilli powder. Considering the positive feedback here, I may try it next time. To my recipe, I added heavy cream for variety and it was divine! So creamy and tasty. I used penne pasta for this dish and topped with fresh tomatoes, toasted pine nuts, and freshly grated parm cheese. Reserve a cup or so of the water in which you boiled your pasta. Mix water little by little to the pasta and pesto as the starch in the water helps the pesto adhere to the pasta. YUM!

Very easy and basic. The hint of heat os something I always enjoy and put in many foods that yould not expect it. Not HOT just a "What is that?" feeling. 

Walnuts work fine although we prefer the toasted pine nuts alone. The restaurant I work at makes and freezes a year's worth at a time with the cheese with no problems at all. If you use the oil right the color is preserved perfectly, if you want the added security put lemon juice in it. A food processor is much better than a blender and hand mincing is best if you have the knife skills. Finally, there is a Pampered Chef recipe that uses chicken stock instead of oil which is amazing in small batches and still really good if used 1/2 & 1/2 in the smaller batches. 

Great Foundation recipe!!!

I used only the ingredients listed, I didn't experiment and add a bunch of stuff and then try to rate your recipe.  The taste was very nice, everyone liked it.   It was as good as any pesto I've had at restaurants.  Next time I'll toast the nuts before I add them.

Four stars is only because I couldn't get the basil to "paste" in my blender.  I ended up adding everything just to get it to blend.  It could just be my blender.   I'll try adding the basil in slowly next time.

This is delicious!! Very easy and super yummy! Just used pine nuts and added extra garlic as we are garlic lovers. Made in the food processor this was a great sauce to use for pasta, sandwiches, or even as a pizza topping.

delicious! I doubled the garlic and added salt. Can't imagine this without salt. It's a good basic recipe. I think I might add more parmesan cheese next time. I'll definitely make this again.

I made this recipe tonight with fresh basil from my garden. It was very good, the only thing I did different was sprinkle with a 1/2 tsp. salt and I omitted the brazil nuts. Made enough for dinner and some for another night. Thanks for the recipe, I always wanted to make homemade pesto.

how the recipe is written exactly- you could play with it. I enjoyed this pesto sauce with grilled chicken and rotini(spiral) pasta. The oil is a bit much and i would recommend to cut back some(maybe 1/2 to 3/4 cup). A little salt is needed also. But over all, i will make this again and will edit and tweak it next time. Thanks for the good recipe. I also couldnt find brazil nuts so used a handful of walnuts instead.

I omitted the brazil nuts and chili powder.  Also added salt and pepper.  Didn't measure the olive oil either.  Just added it until I liked the consistancy. With these modifications, this is a fantastic traditional pesto.

Liked this recipe a lot.  I did find, however, that the pesto I made was a little thick for the dish I was making.  (I had a heck of a time trying to mix it into pasta.)  Maybe more oil, or a little water would have helped.  Tasted great though!  I put chicken on top of the pesto pasta, and it was a hit at dinner time!

Made this once as directed but minus the chili powder.  Thought it was good but too sharp from the parm.  Made it again using mostly romano and a little parm instead and it was excellent!! Also toasted the pine nuts, added a little salt and lemon juice.

I used a cup of raw almonds and half a cup of sunflower seeds instead of the expensive pine nuts. Toasted 'em then ground 'em. Still spectacular. This recipe is a keeper. :)

I have made this repeatedly over the past few years and am just now getting around to rating. As it stands, the recipe is maybe a three-star, but with a tiny bit of modification, it becomes much better. I add LOTS more garlic, some seasoned salt, and more parmesan. It's a good starting point, then play around with it until you're satisfied. I have found this freezes well in ice cube trays for future use. I have also poured a thin layer of olive oil over the top and frozen in a plastic container with good results, but I don't typically need a large amount all at once.

This is the 2nd year I made it, and it is fantastic. I did not use the chili powder as my kids can smell and taste that from a mile away, I find that using 2 TBSP of the fresh garlic gives it enough zing. Toast the pine nuts and have omitted the other nuts. I have frozen it in the ice-tray and then moved to a freezer zip-lock bag. I served it with grilled chicken strips on top of fresh pasta and my guests and family could not stop slurping it! 
When you sautee the chicken strips or just after you removed the pasta from the boiling water, add 3 cubes of the pesto and it will melt within minutes.

Hi, I'm from Genoa (Liguria) where pesto sauce was born. The recipe is fine and right but we don't use chili. A suggestion: use pesto as pasta sauce (better linguine or penne) and top with boiled potatoes and string beans.

took this to a wedding reception and it was a hit. Only thing I changed was omitted the brazil nuts and just added more toasted pine nuts.

Lovely! It's my first time making pesto. Used walnuts instead of brazil nuts, and added a bit more oil.

This is wonderful!!  A great use for my fresh basil plant.  I omitted the brazil nuts because mine were no longer fresh.  I actually measured my garlic and used a lot more cloves than I thought.  I found 3/4 cup of olive oil sufficient.  I also toasted my pine nuts first.  Used this on Pesto Pizza by Ann Miner for a delicious meal!!

Great recipe! The first thing you notice is the dark green colour, not like store bought pesto which is usually "fluffed-up" with oil, nuts etc. One point though, be careful with the chili powder, I think I added a bit too much (or the chili powder was too hot) and it masked the other flavours to a degree. Will add it gradually next time to taste.

I've tried a number of basil pesto recipes and there was always something just a little off. With the omission of the Brazil nuts (I didn't have any), this recipe was simple and tasty, and is now in my recipe box. I used some of the pesto on pasta, which disappeared at dinnertime, and I froze the remainder in an ice cube tray. Thanks for the recipe!

Great!  I added salt and pepper and more garlic.  I only needed 3/4 cup of the olive oil, as I usually add chopped sundried tomatoes (packed in oil) to my pesto dishes.

Editting to add that the second time I made this, I subbed 1 Cup of lemon balm (got it in my CSA box) for 1 cup of the basil.  Nice variation.  I also only used 1/2 cup oil and it was plenty.  Love this recipe!

Editting again.... used 1 cup of fresh chives the last time I made it.  I also used walnuts in place of the pine nuts because Costco was out of them  Worked nicely!  Also added the juice of one lemon and was able to cut back on the oil a bit more while still keeping the right consistency.  This recipe is so versatile!

This is a great recipe! I made a couple small changes. I used 3/4 C of toasted pine nuts and no Brazil nuts. I doubled the minced garlic as I LOVE garlic and used 3/4 C of good Reggiano Parmesano. I was reluctant to try the chili powder but did and I didn't detect any chili flavor. I'm not really sure what the purpose of the chili powder is but there were no adverse effects. I will definitely make this again and again!!

Followed other reviews and toasted pine nuts at 300f in oven for 10 minutes and then crushed/grinded them using the back of a spoon. Added them in at the very end (do not blend these in the machine ... found out the hard way that if you do it taste like grass). Left out brazil nuts (didn't have any) and will add cheese when I serve this since I'll be freezing the batch I made. Also added juice of half lemon for taste and to keep the color nice while frozen.

This was soooo GOOD! I had been using jar sauce and always had less than satisfying results. I made this pesto and added it to some ricotta cheese, mozzarella, parm, salt and pepper and used it in home made ravioli.  WOW, awesome! Thanks.

Excellent. Doubled the ingredients, but didnt end up using, or needing all of the oil. I also added fresh rosemary and a dash of lemon juice! I poured it into ice cube trays to save for individual servings... My kids love it!

Great! I didn't use Brazil nuts.  I toasted the pine nuts before using.  I didn't use 1 cup olive oil, I only used enough to give me the consistency I wanted.  These flavors are great together.

This was phenomenal!  I left out the Brazil nuts and just used about 3/4 c pine nuts, which I toasted on the stove.  I also added just a pinch of salt, about 1/8 tsp.  I tried to follow some users' suggestions to leave out the chili powder, but it was much too bland without.  It adds just the right amount of zing without being too spicy (even my 4-year-old liked it).  A dash of lemon juice might be a good idea for color preservation because the bright green did darken quite a lot very quickly, but that's just for aesthetic value.  It took all my willpower to keep myself from eating it straight out of the blender with a spoon.  I am going to make several more batches for canning and give them as Christmas presents to my family.  It is so delicious!

I like this recipe, and it worked well with the substitutions I had to make. I had no nuts, so I ground up a half cup of oats and added an extra TBS of oil. It tasted surprisingly good, and I hardly noticed the lack of nuttiness thanks to the Parmesan.

This is the first time I have made pesto from scratch. I loosely followed the recipe I toasted the pine nuts, omitted the brazil nuts, used 4 cloves of garlic (which was a bit too strong so I'll reduce that next time to just 2), and lastly I didn't measure the oil but poured it in the blender until it was the consistency I wanted.

It would really help if the serving size were given. I need a specific amount of pesto, and this gives me no clue of what I'll end up with! Grrrrr.
Ok...now it's a day later and I made this. It made 11 oz for me. So the serving size is 1 oz per person. Recipes ALWAYS need to have the yield; the number of servings alone is meaningless.
The taste is ok; next time I'll cut back a bit on the oil, which I find a little overpowering. Or, cut to the chase and buy jarred, which I'm guessing can be even better. Maybe this needs more cheese?

I've been craving turkey pesto sandwiches so this recipe came in handy.  I mixed the pesto with Hellman's mayo to put on the sandwich bread.  Also added a few dried cranberries into the sandwich.  It was simple, easy and the taste was exactly what I was looking for.  I've probably eaten six pesto sandwiches in the past two days if that tells you anything!

This was FABULOUS - esp. for a hot summer supper. Basil from our garden. Fresh cut tomatoes, celery and cukes, yummy crusty multi-grain bread, goat cheese, and we added the watermelon salsa (goat cheese on top of that also). My grandson is allergic to pine nuts so we used what we had - almonds and walnuts. OH - and he's the one who actually made the pesto. Can't wait to make it again.

I didn't use chili powder or the brazil/pine nuts or parmesan cheese in my version.  I did use everything else, PLUS I added sun-dried tomatoes and ground black pepper and simple ground peanuts surprisingly enough, because I had no other nuts available.  Oh it was so tasty... I put it over Penne pasta and the family ate it up!  :)

Absolutely my favourite so far - used really fresh garlic/added fresh cracked pepper instead of chili powder -used walnuts instead of pine nuts (That's what I had on hand)   Try a small stir fry of any combination of zucchini/onion/bell peppers/black olives/chicken tossed with good quality tomato sauce on top of linguine -    Add pesto ...red wine... :)

I used a mortar and pestle and added sea salt as I blended. I also added oil as needed, so didn't use the full amount. This tasted excellent tossed with linguini.

This is a good pesto recipe. I modified it a little adding only pine nuts and not adding all that oil. I like my pesto to be more of a paste consistency. Sometimes I add a fresh tomato to substitute for part of the oil. I also added some black pepper and I always skip the chili powder.

Thank you so much for this recipe!  I made a large batch and froze all of it in an ice cube tray.  I put the cubes in a ziplock and froze.  Yesterday I thawed some and used to put on brochutto for my daughter's 21st birthday Italian dinner party.  Again, thank you.

Good recipe. Easy ingredients (except the Brazil Nuts) make it easy to do when you get the gumption. Good flavor, though next time (and there will be a next time) I'll add maybe some pepper or more garlic or something. It just wasn't a strong enough pesto.

I used this as a base but I went wild with my own stuff after it seemed too oily.  I may not have used enough basil.  Anyway, good stuff nonetheless!  Thanks!

Before I tried this recipe, I was a "red" sauce type of guy. This Pesto is simply amazing! Added bonus: Everything fit inside my Mini-Prep processor - so no need to dirty the large one.

Even after a couple of attempts and adjustments my pesto seemed far oilier than necessary.  The flavor was good but not excellent.  With some more tweeking it would likely come together.

Make sure that your garlic isn't too strong or cut in half (1 Tbsp) and if you use Parmesan in the shaker reduce by 2 Tbsp.  I tried Tia Basil the first time and it is not as strong so the other flavors were prominent.  I also reduced the virgin olive oil by 2 Tbsp and used Walnut oil and substituted the nuts for Walnuts.  I used what I had.  Next time I will try sticking to the recipe. It still turned out good.  I am going to let it sit for several days and if still too strong will add more basil possible some spinach leaves to cut the garlic.

This recipe is excellent. I actually subbed walnuts the second time since I didn't have any pine nuts and I didn't notice any real difference. I just use walnuts now every time to saved expense. I do prefer it without the chili powder and 3/4 cup of oil instead. Really yummy!

Overall, this recipe makes for a nice pesto. I omitted the brazil nuts, and I used a food processor (blender just didn't work as well). I also used minced garlic from a jar (was in a hurry), and the result seemed a bit bland. Next time, I plan to use fresh garlic, salt, pepper, a little less oil, and a little less Parm cheese. I might also experiment with a few drops of lemon juice. I will definitely make this again. It worked well in the Pesto Chicken Penne Casserole recipe from this site.

Easy, yummy pesto recipe. Will definitely make again! Toasted the pine nuts first in a dry skillet, shaking constantly over medium heat (oven toasting attempt ended poorly - method not recommended). Omitted the chili powder and brazil nuts - not needed. Served a little dollop alongside fresh tomatoes and fontina cheese with a drizzle of balsamic and salt/pepper to taste. So good!

Terrific w/or w/out brazil nuts or chili powder.  I freeze extra in ice cube tray (then put in freezer bag) and use it all year long!  Freshly grated parmesan makes all the difference.

Fantastic pesto! I used macadamia nuts because my supermarket didn't have pine nuts in small quantities, and I omitted the Brazil nuts, but everything else stayed the same. It was great. Used it on "Pesto Hamburgers" from allrecipes and my husband said it was the best burger he's ever had.

I made this after a bumper crop of Basil in my garden!  It was awesome.  I froze a bunch and gave some to my Aunt.  She said it was to die for and wanted the recipe.  My family and I thought it was awesome and are growing more Basil for another batch.  I found the pine nuts to be expensive but also made another batch using almonds instead which also turned out good.

I cut the recipe in thirds and spread it over thin chicken breasts before rolling them up and baking. The pesto was the best part. Will be repeating this one as soon as my basil plant recovers from the harvest.

All I have to say is WOW.  I left out the chili powder and substituted pecans for Brazil nuts and WOW.  I'm sure it would be good the original way, but I only had pecans! The garlic really gave it a kick, so if you want it with more heat, up the garlic amount!  The husband fired this down in minutes.  Will definitely make this again soon and often!!

The brazilian nuts and chili powder have me scratching my head. I used red pepper flake for the heat instead, and toasted the pine nuts over medium-low heat until they started to brown and they gave off a nutty aroma. Be sure to use a high quality olive oil (I use Axienda Olearia del Chianti) and real Parmigiano Reggiano (I used Montanari & Gruzza).  If I could get raw Brazilian nuts, I'd be willing to try it, but they just aren't in high demand in Italy.

I think I'll cut back on the oil a tad next time - perhaps I just didn't blend it long enough. I also omitted the chili powder since I was looking for a really basic basil recipe. I think next time I will try adding nutmeg. My parents were really impressed with this recipe! I tossed some elbow macaroni noodles in the pesto, added some quartered cherry tomatoes and feta (my favorite pasta dish) and froze the rest for later. Thanks for sharing!
UPDATE: will definitely cut back on the oil, as the pesto did not freeze all the way when i put it in the ice cube trays as one reviewer recommended

I made several batches of this pesto at the end of summer..I had 3 large, very vigorous basil plants and wanted to use them up.  This is a tasty pesto, but too hot with the chile powder, so I omitted it and it was perfect. I also used walnuts instead of pine nuts and Brazil nuts.  I froze most of it and it has kept well.

This was a great recipe, but I had to halve it because 3 cups of basil is A LOT! It did turn out great, added a little salt and a little extra cheese. Also, followed the advice of someone else and froze the pesto in ice cube tray for easier thawing and serving. Great tip!

Yum! I loosely followed the recipe, and the result was delicious. I used 3 cups fresh basil, 1/2 cup EVOO, 2/3 cup pine nuts (which I toasted on the stove in a dry non-stick skillet), 2/3 cup fresh grated Parmesan cheese, 1 tablespoon minced garlic, and 1/4 teaspoon chili powder. It was so easy to make in my Magic Bullet -- I placed the basil and EVOO in first, then added everything else and blended until smooth. Thank you for the great recipe!

I left out the pine nuts (didn't have any) and the chili. Added 1/2 cup of the olive oil at the begining of the process since I couldn't get the basil to grind in the blender using the called for TBSP. Also used less garlic (just my taste) and added some salt. Very tasty pesto by is self, but used a cup of pesto mixed with some alfredo I had already made and served it with chicken, pasta with roasted asparagus. I froze the rest of the pesto spread out in an ice cube tray to use another day.

Made it exactly like the recipe and it turned out delicious. I saw where another reader waited to add the Parmesan cheese but I didn't and it froze just fine. I didn't have an ice tray so I froze small 1/4 cups of the sauce and then took them out and put them in baggies. Now when I need pesto sauce I just grab a baggie and heat!

Great pesto!  I used it in "Creamy Pesto Pasta Salad with Chicken, Asparagus and Cherry Tomatoes" by Pam Anderson from this site.  I've aldo spread it on crusty french bread and in a pesto cream sauce for whole wheat pasta.   I did use all pinenuts, but that was my only change.

EDIT:
This is now my go-to pesto sauce. My mom sent me 3 lbs of Louisiana pecans so I always use that for the pesto.  I like to slather this pesto on top of white fish before cooking in the oven.  YUM!!!

It was so easy and quick. I didn't have pine or brazil nuts, so I used sliced almonds instead for crunch. It worked out perfectly. I will definitely be making this again.

Pretty much your basic pesto sauce. Instead of the chili powder I added fresh cracked pepper to it for a little kick.

This pesto is really good on crackers. This is the first time we've ever made it.  We had it for a snack one day on crackers and another time on noodles.

I've made pesto with these basic ingredients before.  The chili powder made this version a little different and I thought it gave the pesto a little extra flavor.  I didn't have enough pine nuts so I also used some slivered almonds.

I just finished making this recipe. Turned out great. I reduced the amount of olive oil just a tad. Also added a pinch of salt for more flavor. Will definitely make it again.

Great idea roasting the pine nuts. ALso did not use the Brasil nuts. Who keeps those on hand? Otherwise, really liked the pesto. Great on anything!!

Simple, tasty, a classic. I use jarred garlic on this one has a nice flavor with out the bite of raw garlic. Go easy on the oil at first, until you get the hang of it. I use any kind of unsalted nuts except for peanuts. Salt to taste.

A good base recipe, but I made some changes: no chili powder and no brazil nuts. I cut back on the oil to about 2/3 cup and also added 2-3 TBS fresh lemon juice. To me, the lemon perks up the flavor much better than chili, but to each their own! ;-)

Very easy and tasty recipe but I would use less oil than recommended. I just used this one and found it to have far too much of an oily taste for my preference.

Just made this for the first time.  Delicious!!  I followed the recipe exactly except used all walnuts instead of the pine nuts and brazil nuts, as that was all I had on hand.  This will be my go to pesto recipe in the future.

My new pesto recipe! However, I have some issues with the measurements. Firstly, why would I chop or mince anything if it's going in the food processor. Secondly, instead of 12 servings,I would have preferred amount in cups. I started with 5 medium cloves of garlic and threw into the processor with the blade running. Stopped processor and put in 3 cups of basil leaves, good handful of walnuts, the cheese, a good shake of red pepper flakes instead of chili powder, salt & pepper to taste. Started processor and poured in 1/2 cup of evoo, which seemed to be enough. Since I was using this as a side dish, I cooked a 1/2 lb. of rotelli pasta, tossed with the pesto and only had enough leftover pesto to fill 3 ice cubes in an ice cube tray. That all said it was delicious and will be making again.

This is a fun recipe,i had no Brazil nuts but I added Tahini, then I decided to add some lemon juice, thought that would brighten the flavor  I am going to serve it with salmon tonight, nice recipe that I will use over and over. Bet I could use crunchy peanut butter also , love recipes like this.

Deliciously fantastic. I left out Brazil nuts and only used 1/2 cup of extra virgin olive oil. I used 1/8 teaspoon of chili powder so my daughter would enjoy it. This is the recipe I will use from now on!

It came out more like a pesto-y cheese spread, which is delicious, but not quite pesto.

Easy and delicious! Both my husband and I love this. We omitted brazil nuts because they weren't available at any local stores, but it was still amazing. Great to mix in with ricotta for stuffed shells or with pesto chicken pasta.

I had a basil plant and didn't know what to do with all the basil. I use this recipe with the pesto cheesy chicken rolls and the family loves it! My mother is on a low carb diet and she can eat this and enjoys the flavor. As others said, I make extra and freeze it for later. I didn't have much luck with the freezing in the ice cube trays, so instead I put in the smaller portion sized tupperware and it worked out just great. It's great with the chicken, great on just plain noodles, anything your imagination can think of. Really great recipe.

I made this without pine nuts as I didn't have those on hand, and it turned out pretty great anyway! I did have to add a bit of salt though. Froze in an ice cube tray then put the cubes in a freezer bag. Cut a cube in half and placed each half on a couple chicken breasts I baked tonite, letting them bake with the chicken. Soo delicious!! Super easy to make and I love that I can have pesto anytime I want.

How yummy! I will never buy pesto from the grocery store again. I didn't really measure anything except the basil. I also added about 3 tablespoons of olive oil to blend the basil into a paste. After that I threw in 1 package of pine nuts, 6 garlic cloves, and a 5 ounce block of parmesan cheese cut into cubes. I blended it all together then added in the rest of the olive oil, omitting the brazil nuts and chili powder. So good and easy to make!

Good pesto.  Only used half the amount of chili powder and there was still a descent kick.  Also did not use any Brazil nuts and replaced pine nuts with walnuts.  I gave this recipe four stars because it called for too much garlic- I suggest using 1T or 1-1/2 T at most.

I loved this, it was the first time I've made pesto. I used all Brazil nuts because I live in South America, and pine nuts cost a fortune while Brazil nuts are cheap. It still came out great, I took another person's advice and left out the chili powder, but next time I might try mixing some in. I'm freezing half of it!

Maybe I just don't like pesto, but this seemed dry to me and way too much basil. You couldn't even taste anything else. Sorry, but I was actually being generous by giving it two stars.

This was so tasty!  I used pine nuts, since I always have those handy.  I used up all my summer basil and made pesto "ice cubes" to freeze for a taste of summer during the winter.

What makes this recipe great is that the ingredients are simple (I never add Brazil nuts--I would if I had them on hand) and it always turns out perfect. I have to give five stars to a recipe where I never measure anything but it turns out great anyway.

Delicious! I used walnuts instead of brazil nuts (too lazy to shell and couldn't find any shelled) and it was just wonderful.

I halved the ingredients to make a pasta dish for two.  I omitted the brazil nuts and used a hand immersion blender to put it all together.  The sauce was completed in 5 minutes flat and came out perfect.  I added some coarse grey sea salt and heated it in a saucepan, adding a little heavy cream, and tossed it with papparadelle pasta.  Delicious!

This is wonderful!  I added way too much garlic and still loved it.  I froze it in ice cube trays then popped the frozen cubes into a freezer bag.  One cube is enough for most recipes.

This is the first time I made pesto.  There are two large lemon basil plants in my back garden.  I created the paste like texture from my Kitchen Aid food processor.  I did not use any Brazil nuts, only pine nuts.  Like other reviewers, I did not add a full cup of olive oil.  I experimented with the oil by starting with only a half cup and increasing it to almost 3/4 of a cup.  Like anything else, it's easier to add than remove.  I also added 1/2 tsp of black pepper from my pepper mill to add some zip to the pesto.  Finally, you just need to add enough pesto to coat the pasta.  Anything more will be too overpowering.

This was pretty tasty, tossed with penne. Suprisingly, it did need a little salt, even with the parmesan. I'm serving the leftovers with pasta and shrimp tonight.

Before I review a recipe I always follow the directions exactly as the author request.  My family and I says this was the best tasting pesto sauce ever.  It was very rich and nutty.  It was very easy to make. I used it with penne pasta shrimp and chicken. YUMMY DELICIOUS!!!!  Next time I think i wll use sausage and bowtie pasta...If its wonderful I will let you know!

A good starter recipe, though I found it bland, having left out the chili powder, which my family doesn't like. To brighten the flavor, I added some fresh lemon juice and some sea salt. Then, it was awesome! I doubled the recipe and froze quite a bit for winter.

Good base for pesto recipe, I did make a few changes; used less olive oil than called for, toasted the pine nuts until lightly browned over a skillet. Added a little extra garlic, and substituted chili powder for crushed red pepper and omitted the brazilian nuts. I served this with cubed chicken breast and fettucini.

Thanks for the great recipe.  Couldn't be easier. Only change I made was to omit the Brazil nuts and use a little less oil. My garden basil is very aromatic and a litle spicy this year and I found the proportions perfect to marry the flavors to enhance the basil. The consistency was perfect. This is a keeper.

A very very good pesto. The Brazil nuts were hard to find, I ended up picking them out of a can of mixed nuts but they added such an interesting crunch we decided they were worth the effort.  Defiantly a do over, only next time we decided to cut down on the chili powder to please our son.

Thank you for a super pesto recipe that doesn't have 2 dozen ingredients like the rest on this website. If you are looking for a very tasty & easy recipe, this is it. I followed the other reviewer's suggestion to freeze leftover portions in an ice cube tray. Left out the brazil nuts and I highly recommend toasting the pine nuts before adding them.

This recipe was great, the only thing missing is the salt.  I left out the Brazil nuts and added a bit more cheese.  When I was done making the sauce I threw it in a skillet with cooked fettucine and mixed it to coat the noodles.  My boyfriend is an avid pesto lover and he thought the only thing missing was the amount of salt, but you can easily fixe that by adding it to your pasta dish.

I never made my own pesto before and this was surprisingly easy, not to mention extremely good.  Done in minutes.  I used half the oil and used pine nuts only.  I was hesitant about the chili powder, but ended up adding half at the end - really good!  Used the entire batch on Pesto Cheesy Chicken Rolls, also on this site.

This was a very easy recipe and very tasty.  I did however make a few changes.  I cut the Extra virgin olive oil in half, a whole cup made the pesto very oily.  I eliminated the brazil nuts and the chili powder.  I added a little extra parmesan cheese which added good flavor.  I also added salt and pepper.  Don't forget to toast the pine nuts.

This was great! The chili powder was a great addition for a nice zing.  I omitted Brazil nuts, added a dash of lemon juice and a bit more garlic and it was fabulous!!  Served it as an appetizer at a dinner party and it was gone in minutes!!

I can't say the 4 stars are for this recipe exactly, since we made some heavy modifications. We had no pine nuts and my husband ate the last of the almonds, but I had basil to use up, so he suggested using tahini instead of the nuts. I wasn't sure about that, but it turned out pretty tasty! I made a 1/2 batch and used about 1/3 c. tahini and a little less than 1/2 c. olive oil, and 3  cloves garlic. Also added a pinch of salt and about a tablespoon of lemon juice. The pesto had a really rich flavor and was delicious with eggs.

This was an impulse decision, and I had to make a few substitutions. I had no Brazil nuts and I don’t eat dairy, so I used a bit of chopped hazelnut and a dash of salt. Oh! I also added a touch of mint. Mm-mm! This was delicious over baked chicken breast. It was gone before I thought of snapping a pic.

I had a bunch of basil to use up from my garden so this recipe worked perfect.  My husband and I loved it!  The only thing I did different was to add some extra olive oil and a bit of sea salt.

Love it recipe! So much better than buying it premade at the store. Used it on linguine with shrimp and it was so, so good! Super easy to do in your NutriBullet!

I made it exactly like the recipe except omitted the Brazil nuts. It is excellent. When serving tonight, I intend to offer more olive oil and toasted pine nuts with each dish, as desired. I’m serving it tonight with sautéed chicken, broccoli and tomatoes over pasta.  This pesto sauce tastes exactly like the one used in a dish I used to get years ago at my favorite Italian restaurant in Oklahoma City. He called it Broccoli and Tomato Basilica.

Easy and perfect! My picky family (including a 6 year old) loved it.  My husband doesn't like rich, creamy sauces with pasta so this was a great choice.  I use fresh basil from my herb garden.  I put this with penne and seafood.  Thank you for submitting this!

I made this with the following changes: about 3/4 cup toasted pine nuts, 2/3 cup grated pecorino-romano cheese and 2 very large fresh whole cloves of garlic (in addition to the fresh basil and EVOO). I did not add Brazil nuts nor chili powder so I guess my version is more of a traditional pesto but I love it. Thank you for the inspiration though!

Excellent pesto. I've been making it for years.  I make a couple of small changes based on ingredient availability and personal taste. I use macadamia nuts instead of brazil, because I can never find them. (Accidentally bought salted nuts once- and just rinsed them good. It was fine.) I toast the nuts to bring on the flavor. And, I use a little less garlic (1T-1.5T), and I increase the cheese to a full cup...just because, who doesn't love more cheese? My boys wait to lick the bowl like it was chocolate cake batter.

This recipe is amazing! My family loved it on pasta, and I plan to use it in my chicken parmesan.  The only nuts that I had was toasted sliced almonds, and the nutty flavor was still good. I forgot the heat, but I will probably add it next time for an unexpected flavor. Also, I don't' have a food processor, so I used my blender. Clearly it isn't the preferred tool, but it worked with a bit of persistence.  I only added oil a bit at a time. I do not think that I used nearly as much as the recipe suggested.  My family asked me to make it again, and I plan to do so soon and freeze a portion of it.

This is a great recipe to use as a basis for a pesto. I usually don't have the pine nuts or Brazil nuts but I sub whatever I have sunflower seeds, pecans, walnuts etc. comes out great every time. I make a big batch and freeze it in ice cube trays. Makes a nice single portion for meats, pasta, seafood. Thanks!

I used about half of the oil that was suggested. I added extra pine nuts in lieu of the brazil nuts. I added cayenne pepper instead of chili powder. This is very delicious on top of homemade corn tortillas.

The recipe doesn't say how tightly to pack the cups of basil.  I packed the measuring cup tight to the top with basil.  The end result tasted like raw basil. I let it sit for a couple of days in the fridge and tried it again, adding some extra oil since it was so thick. The result was still  too strong.  Maybe I needed to pick more mature basil leaves and not pack it so much.

Wow! I absolutely love this!! This is my first time making pesto from scratch and I tell you I am never going to buy store pesto again. I now know how easy it is to make this fresh and store it.  I did not have any brazilian nuts so I used more pine nuts. The pesto leftovers I placed in an ice cube tray to freeze and will put in a ziplock bag later to store for later use. I think next time I will also toast the pine nuts first (roll around in a very hot pan until lightly brown) and then put in with the pesto to blend. I am so glad I found this recipe!

Love this.  Left out chili.  Used walnuts instead of brazil nuts.  Very easy!  Good use of overgrown basil plants at end of summer.

I did not like this at all.  It smelled like artichokes and no I did not put any in it.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Just not for me I guess.

This is Fantastic!  Very flavorful, even w/o the brazil nuts (I used extra pine nuts).  I used fresh garlic and did include the chili powder, though not as much as called for.  Came out great in the blender.

My all-time favorite pesto recipe! All the measurements were perfect as-is. I did have a hard time finding Brazil nuts, and ended up buying a can of mixed nuts, then picking out the Brazil nuts, both times I've made this. Since that's pretty expensive (and a hassle), next time I think I may omit the Brazil nuts entirely. I added about half the oil with the basil, as it was difficult to get it to blend, but that could just be my blender. Wonderful recipe though, a favorite of my family :)

Good flavor for chicken and pasta dishes!  I froze mine in ice cube trays and enjoyed it all winter.  I did leave out the brazil nuts and I like it this way.  No other changes to suggest.

Great base recipe and very flexible.  I made it in my Cuisinart instead of the blender and tossed most of the ingredients in at once instead of gradually.  I omitted the chili powder and used extra pine nuts (which I toasted first) in place of Brazil's.  I also used Grana Padano cheese instead of Parmesan, which has a bit more nuttiness. All together it was really yummy!  Am serving it over cheese tortellini.

Delicious! This is the best basil recipe yet! I toasted the pine nuts and brazil nuts for about 4 minutes in the toaster oven at 425. I added some kosher salt and pepper to taste, and was generous with the garlic. I was reluctant to add the chili powder, but I went ahead and it really is very subtle. I have made pestos with walnuts, pecans, etc so in a pinch you can use just about any nut, but pine nuts are traditional. Thanks for the recipe!

It was excellent.  I did however use extra Basil because we love love love basil and I put less nuts in it.  I also put a little less olive oil.  Thank you for sharing.

Good recipe. I only used pine nuts and I omitted the chilli powder. My food processor is broken so I tried using a blender, that didn't work so well. I ended up chopping the pine nuts which I had toasted first then putting them in the magic bullet. Turned out great. I'm planning something with the leftovers.

I served this at a party to a very picky, non-adventurous crowd.  When I finally got them to try the pesto on bread, they loved it!  Turned out to be the hit of the party!!!  I'm definitely going to freeze some for winter enjoyment.

I love this Pesto, I'm so pleased with it.  I used it in the Penne with Chicken and Pesto Recipe and made a yummy creamy Pesto sauce with cream, I am just learning to cook and I know I will now make this at least twice a month for my family or maybe once a week, I can't wait to have it again.  Love it!

Really awesome pesto!!! Made it last night...had no brazil nuts so added abit more pine nuts as another reviewer suggested...turned out great!!! Wasnt sure today what I wanted to make with it so I experiemented and it turned out super!!!! (even my husband who doesnt like pesto ate it all!!! I sauteed the vegggies I had available in my fridge (in my case mushrooms, green pepper, onion and celery) I also chopped two medium tomatoes fresh picked from the garden. Mixed all this together with the pesto over low heat. Then I added half a can of whole plum tomatoes really mashing them up.....I also added all the tom juice from the can. Brought all to a boil and then simmered for 15 minutes addoing salt and pepper to taste. Chopped up some leftover plain chicken breast and served the meat and sauce over some fussilli pasta with garlic bread!!! SOOOOOO GOOODDDD!!! thx for the recipe:)

This was good, but I would add the garlic a little at a time. I like garlic but I don't like my mouth burning from it! It was very easy to make and my husband really liked it besides the garlic comment. I also did not use as much olive oil.

Pretty good base...but I used just pine nuts, omitted the chili powder as many reviewers suggested, and added a splash of lemon and garlic salt.  My husband likes strong flavors...I thought the lemon was a nice addition.

This pesto was AWESOME. I omitted all nuts due to allergies in the family, and instead added a bit of chopped sundried tomatoes. Also added a little salt, but otherwise used all ingredients in proportion. I used it as a sauce for a white pizza and my entire family raved.

My kids thought this was too spicy.  Our fresh farmers' market basil (green and purple) did have quite a bite, as did the fresh garlic.  I mixed in a little cream to soften it and that was really tasty.  I didn't have brazil nuts so I used a few walnuts, and I toasted them and the pine nuts first to improve the flavor.  I tried the recipe as suggested in the blender to begin with and it just didn't nicely turn into a paste.  I finally just dumped everything in and blended, and it took less than a minute.  Next time I won't waste 5 minutes with the first step.  :)

Loved this pesto!  I used pecans instead of walnuts and didn't have quite enough cheese but it turned out great! A great way to use up extra basil from the garden. I tossed some with Whole wheat penne and froze the rest in an icecube tray for a later use!  YUMMY

This recipe is wonderful.  I make it in my food processor and add more fresh parmesan cheese than is called for and I add double the toasted pine nuts.  My high school daughter and her friends are always asking me to make this for them. It's one of our favorites.

This is the BEST recipe for Garlic Basil Pesto out there!  It makes more than you will need for a dish or two, so I would recommend freezing the left over portion for later use.  Once you have used this recipe, you will not go back to store bought pesto.  I find that pine nuts are a little hard to come by at times so when I do find them I get extra to keep on hand.

I toasted the pine nuts, added some ground pepper, kosher salt, and lemon juice.  Great recipe though not quite as flavorful as other pesto I've tried.  Altogether a great simple recipe.

This was great, but it called for WAY too much garlic. One tablespoon is plenty. In the future I'll use one or less.

This was a great recipe, but I did make a few changes.  I eliminated the brazil nuts.  I roasted the pine nuts first.  I also added 2/3 cups of asiago cheese.  I reduced the olive oil by half.  I also eliminated the chili powder.

Awesome recipe.  I had three huge basil plants to use up and made five batches of this stuff!  Worked well over sauted chicken on top of Romaine Salad.

This was a pretty good pesto recipe.  I made a few changes myself however.  For one thing, I left out the chili powder.  I like a traditional pesto and the thought of chili powder in it didn't sound appealing to me.  Also, I used shelled pistachios in place of the pine nuts and brazil nuts.  I've also substituted pine nuts as your recipe stated and walnuts to great effect.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used walnuts instead of Brazil nuts then froze the leftovers in ice trays so I can use a perfect portion all year

This is really good.  I only used one clove of garlic and about 1/2 the chili powder.  I was a little reluctant to use chili powder, but was glad I did.  I think more than one clove of garlic would be too much.  I also ground a little sea salt in, which I thought added a bit more flavor.  Will make again.
