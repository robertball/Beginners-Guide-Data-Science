While I love each of the individual ingredients, I wasn't a big fan of cauliflower prepared this way. It definitely was simple, but I found the end result was dry with weird pasty areas where the curry mixture had cooked on top of cauliflower.  It just seemed like the mixture should have been very evenly and thinly spread over the cauliflower to prevent the clumpy texture. I ended up scraping some of the mixture off after it was cooked. The tops had tons of curry flavor, while the rest of the florets were still white with no flavor. A sprinkle of salt definitely improved things. I almost would have preferred heating the sauce separately and using it as a dip for the cooked cauliflower. Thanks for sharing your recipe Griz!

I've made this recipe a couple of times, and my youngest kiddo (13 at the time) has made it twice.  HUGE hit with myself & the youngest.  I haven't been able to find a place to buy authentic curry, so we have to use extra of the name-brand big spice company version.  Recipe is simple, and really REALLY good. :)

This was great! I often do curried cauliflower in the microwave but knew it needed a little something (fat?) to give it more oomph.  This was perfect!  I did individual cauliflower florets because I prefer to prepare it that way.  Didn't have yogurt, but it didn't matter.  Turned out perfect just using the mayo! This one is a keeper!

I love this recipe!  Simple to make,  good curry flavour and quite an eye catching  presentation.  Especially in my white square bowl, one head of cauliflower really stands out. Have made several times.  Plan to experiment with different spices ion place of curry.

Edible, but not a fan. I did cook in oven instead of microwave. Followed recipe then put a little water in bottom of casserole dish, covered with foil and baked. The sauce kind of dried up on the cauliflower. Luckily, I had extra sauce (which is tasty) to slather on after cooked. Might make again and microwave.

I love Califlower and curry.  I used regular yogurt instead of Greek.  Came out delicious and made two dinner side dishes for my husband and me.  So quick and easy and special.  Will make again and again.
