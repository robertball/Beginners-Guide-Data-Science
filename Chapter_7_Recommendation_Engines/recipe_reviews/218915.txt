This was incredible. After I baked it, I threw in a heaping half cup of organic raisins. The kids and I thought this was like eating oatmeal cookies in a bowl. VERY good.

Great recipe! I love granola and making it homemade is perfect when you need a healthy snack or something to perk up your yogurt or oatmeal in the morning. This has a really nice blend of flavors!

AMAZING recipe! I chose this because there's no sugar in it. So glad I did, my husbands a chef and now he's asking me to make this as our staple granola.

I love granola and this recipe is super simple and very yummy.  

Quick update:  I made a second batch of this with a couple of alterations.  I added 1tsp pure Mexican vanilla and a beaten egg white.  I poured my mixture onto a cookie sheet and pressed it down.  Then I baked it uncovered for 12 minutes after that I covered it with foil, pressed it down again and baked another 15.  The vanilla added nice flavor and the egg white helped the granola clump.  A very good recipe I will be making regularly!

I have been making granola for the past few months, changing each time to find just the right one. I don't need to search any longer. I found it! This is fantastic. I did not have enough almonds so went with 1/2 cup of almonds and 1/2 cup of pecans. Also did not have almond oil so used grapeseed oil. It came out perfect.   Thank you!

This is my first time making granola from scratch! This was very good! I love almonds. Different nuts would be good in this, pecans, walnuts, etc., or raisins. very good! be careful not burn this. I baked at 350 for 15 minutes, then lowered teh temperature to 325. keep an eye on it and mix frequently, every 10 minutes or so.

Good base recipe.  I added about 3 T of brown sugar, some vanilla, and about 1/4 tsp of salt before baking.  When it was done in the oven, I added some raisins and dried cranberries.  I did have a problem with the baking time.  It was WAY TOO LONG.  I had mine in for about 17 minutes and I still questioned whether it was a little overdone.

Easy starter recipe. It lacked some flavor so I added almost 1/4 c. light brown sugar and increased the cinnamon to 1 1/2 tsp. I also toasted both slivered almonds and coconut and increased the oats to 3 c. I used a bit less than 1/4 c. oil and mixed in some golden raisins the last 5 mins of cooking and mine was done in 25 mins. I stirred it every 10 mins. Very good basic and easy granola recipe I will make again. Great in yogurt, oatmeal and cereal...and just eating out of hand!!

That was wonderful!  Totally didn't need any sugar added.  My daughter LOVES it.  I do think I toasted the almonds a bit long but even with that it tastes fabulous.  I only cooked mine for 25 minutes as other reviewers suggested and it was the perfect amount of time.  We like to make apple granola sandwiches with it.  Slice apples, spread peanut butter, and sprinkle with granola. Yummy!

This is one of the easier granola recipes I've made. Turned out beautifully. I added about a half cup of dried fruit (blueberries and cranberries) and used sweetened coconut, whole almonts, and a little salt to taste. Magnificent!

I am more than positive that I did everything right but your recipe not only had my almonds burn but the whole batch of granola itself burned as well. You should really check your recipe.

This was my first attempt at homemade granola, and it was a hit!  The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars was because I haven't quite mastered the "chunky" effect for my granola.  I didn't realize how much more it would chunk together as it cooled, so I added additional honey/oil to help with the bunching.  It was a little too sticky and I will be trying this again with no additional honey - just letting the granola cool!  I had also taken the advice of some other reviewers and added raisins and brown sugar.  Delicious!

This is by far the easiest granola recipe I have found and one of the most delicious!! 

* make sure you don't let this sit in your oven after timer goes off it burns easy after 30 minutes! First time I made it I almost cried because I got distracted and it was burnt.. =( but other than that AMAZING!! =D

I made this as a "thank you" gift for the women who help out in my classroom.  One recipe was the perfect size for four small gifts.  

After reading other reviews about it burning, I baked it at 300 degrees, stirring every ten minutes.  It was perfect after 30 minutes.  Quick and easy to make; I lined the baking tray with foil, and clean-up was a breeze.  It smelled very floral from the honey while it was baking, so I was concerned the honey would be overpowering, but once it cooled it was fine.  I added some dried cranberries while it was cooling, and I will probably try it again with some additional spices and dried fruit.  It's definitely a good base recipe that can be adjusted to satisfy individual tastes.

have tried a bunch of granola recipes/none were just right...til this one! A keeper. My local groc store does not carry almond oil but they did have walnut oil and I had another recipe I wanted to try that called for walnut oil.....so I sprang for the 7.00 a bottle since I at least had TWO things i could use it for. So glad I did. Yum. Only commnet is on the baking time of 30 min. I stirred mine every 5 min and left it in for 25 min. Really it could have been pulled at 20 min.....30 would definitely have been overbaked.

I made half the recipe since I only had a cup of rolled oats on hand, used chopped walnuts, unsweetened flaked coconut, I mixed the oil & honey & cinnamon in bowl them tossed in the dry ingred & mixed, baked it on parchment in a 300 oven for 15 min, stirred it around then 10 minutes later Perfection! (No need to toast the nuts & coconut first, as it all gets toasted beautifully as delicious granola)

Easy to follow, instead of honey I used molasses (which is rich in iron and vitamins) and I added 1/4 of walnuts and 1/4 of unsalted cashews, I also added a 1/4 of pure maple syrup and a tbs of chia seeds!!! Taste delicious!!! And super nutritious!!!

I thought that this was a fast and easy recipe but I prefered it when I added in raisins after cooking.  I cooked this completely in the microwave so I eliminated the browning of the almonds.  Watch this near the final cooking stage (7-8 minutes in) as it turns quickly, and make sure that you stir all the way to the bottom so that it browns more evenly.

Super yummy! I've made this a few times exactly as written and also subbed half the almonds for pecans once. I like it both ways and pretty much you could sub in nut. I chose this recipe because I pretty much like everything in it and I like that it doesn't have added sugar. I'm not a huge coconut fan and honestly found that it is more a filler than a major contributer to taste. I've also done both oven and microwaave methods and both work well. It's nice to be able to just pop it in the microwave and I think it tunrs out just as well. Just make sure to stir often. I didn't the first time and some in the middle ended up a little burnt.

The recipe is great - I added 2 tsp of vanilla for some special flavor and substituted walnuts for half of the almonds.  The cooking temp, however, is much too high.  After 20 mins the granola started to burn.  I'd recommend lowering the temp to 250.

Excellent base recipe to modify from. Like others, my favorite thing about this recipe was that there was no sugar added!! I did do some changes: I didn't have almonds so I did half cup peanuts chopped and half cup sunflower seeds (both were unsalted). I cut back the coconut flakes to 2/3 cup and added 1/3 cup flaxseed. And i added a little salt and 1 tsp vanilla. Turned out super yummy. Stoked i found this basic granola to go off of!

I'm thankful everyday I found this recipe!!! I've made it a dozen times and it's always great. At first I was adding brown sugar like some other reviews suggest but once I tried the recipe as is I realized there's no need to add the extra calories. My son and I eat a batch in less than a week in yogurt or just by the fist full. It's even great as a cereal. Thank you!!!!!

This is very good but is anyone having a problem with it being chewy?  I am storing it in an air tight container (or maybe it's not). Any suggestions?

Good recipe, I added 1/2 cup almond butter and vanilla based on geigtm's suggestion. Bake time was way too long, I took out after 20min.  May try reducing heat to 325 next time.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I swapped 1 cup of the rolled oats for 1 cup of natural puffed rice. I also toasted the coconut separately first too. I found that when blending the oil and honey, you really have to whisk it fairly briskly until it all comes together smoothly. Overall a great recipe, would not hurt to add dried fruit etc as well. I store it in the freezer and just get out a spoonful for breakfast. When it is all gone i will definitely be making some more!! I found that it was sweet enough already, didnt need any additional sugar. Mine didnt clump together at all really, but that may have been because i didnt let it cool down before stirring it.

This was very good! It burns quite easily, so be sure to keep a close eye on it towards the end.

This is simple, easy and delicious.  It didn't quite take 30 minutes to get done in my oven.  It was more like 25.

I've also made this  adding dried cranberries and using less honey.  I love this recipe.  I'll never buy granola again.

This is a delicious and easy granola. For several years, I owned a bed & breakfast and served this granola to my guests, sometimes with milk and sometimes in a parfait with homemade yogurt and fresh fruit or a homemade fruit compote. And you can change it up with dry cranberries, raisins or candied ginger. Best of all, this granola is low in sugar.

Ooohh this came out good! I used coconut oil, added sunflower seeds and a little chia along with some vanilla to the honey and oil!
Baked a little lower and checked every 5-10mins... cooked for just under 20 minutes.
So yummy!

This turned out so yummy.  Following other’s  suggestions,  I added 1t cinnamon, 2t vanilla, salt, and 1 egg white.    Wisk the egg white, oil, and vanilla together  vigorously.   
Reduce the oven temperature and  watch it so it doesn’t burn.  
I didn’t have enough oats so I added 1/2 C  Trader Joe’s  multigrain hot cereal (rye, barley, oats, and wheat).

Super easy.  Stirred frequently and took out at 20 minutes.  It does need a little sweetness - fruit helps.  Definitely will make again.  Thank you!

Followed the recipe but added some of my own personal touches.  Instead of almond oil I used extra virgin olive oil  . I also added lite brown sugar & vanilla extract for added flavor.  The recipe cook time is way to long, after 15 min the oats were brown. You have to watch it checking every 5 min so It doesn't burn. Once done cooking I added dried cranberries & raw cashews.  This was extremely easy & very good! My kids love it!

I followed the recipe word for word and it still didn't turn out well. The entire batch tasted burnt and was a complete waste of ingredients.

This is such a simple recipe, but it makes a very good granola. I increased the cinnamon to 1 teaspoon, used sweetened coconut and baked it at 300 degrees for 25 minutes. The granola is still soft when it comes out of the oven, but it crisps up as it cools. It browns in the last 5 minutes of cooking, so you need to keep an eye on it so that it doesn't brown too much. The sweetened coconut added just enough sweetness that it didn't need any additional sugar.

Perfect base recipe! Made exact recipe first time and it tasted great, but thought temperature was a little high. After a few other tries, learned 325 is better for 20-25 min, stirring every 10, then before cooling.  I've changed it up by mixing in pumpkin seeds and sunflower seeds, I also use coconut oil. So many possibilities with this recipe! No need to buy  granola anymore. Thank you!

I was not a huge fan of this.  I followed the recipe exactly, but shortened the cooking time.  I felt like it needed to be just a little bit sweeter.  My husband said it had no flavor.

I used a bit less honey, coconut oil in place of the recommended & I used Almond Ext. I baked some and left the rest raw. I like the Raw the best. But I did toast the almonds & coconut. The only problem is you tend to eat more since you don't chew as much  ;(  My grandson liked it raw better also.  Try it - you may like it that way.  I will be making this Many more times!!

Awesome. I threw in about a half tsp of cloves, because I love their spiciness, and this was delicious. I'll make this again for sure.

I have only made granola a handful of times but maybe I should have known better. It tasted DELICIOUS before cooking. Cooking absolutely ruined it. I stirred it frequently but didn't realize it was burning (except around the edges one time when I didn't spread it out evenly). By the time I let it go the last few minutes it was a goner. I will make this recipe again for the flavor but the baking instructions were way off for me. I know everybody's oven is different but I've never had this issue with a recipe. A more experienced granola maker would have used their judgment and common sense. Both of which were lacking on my end. I will probably use a lower temp and shorter bake time.
