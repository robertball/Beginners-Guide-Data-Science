A very good recipe, although the recipe would be better if there were no hummus!!

This recipe was ok.  It seemed like it needed "something."  I added salt and pepper, then paprika, then cayenne pepper but it still wasn't right.  It tasted OK on multigrain crackers though.  Also, my blender wouldn't chop any of the ingredents so I had to use one of those hand crank choppers that you see on tv (the Smart Chopper). If I make it again (that's "if"), I'll probably try adding red peppers or something.

I used 1 bulb of roasted garlic instead of the 3 called for in the recipe. I should have used the 3, 1 bulb does not give this enough flavor!  Instead of red onion, I used a yellow onion--I think they have more flavor!  I'm surprised that with all the herbs, there just wasn't enough flavor, not  when freshly made or after it had been refrigerated.

I added an extra 1/4 cup or red onion & 3 tbsp of Balsamic Vinigrett and it was good.... it had a little bite to it.

I like the roasted garlic flavor, but 1 T lemon juice and a T of olive oil is not enough to make this a hummus-like consistency. I only used 1 can of chickpeas, and I still had to add extra olive oil and water.

Not very flavorful. I had to alter recipe substantially to get the taste I desired. However, easy if you're short on tahini!
