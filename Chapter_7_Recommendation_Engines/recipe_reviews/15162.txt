I was seeking a recipe for a carrot cake that did not contain oil so when I saw this recipe, it appealed to me. I used a fresh carrot from the garden that was so largeand juicy, it was ideal. The cake froze well and proved to be a great winner with every person at the party making complimentary comments on the moisture level and the quality of the cream cheese topping

This is a delicious cake. It's very dense and moist. The icing is TO DIE FOR! I left the raisins out because of others' tastes, but I'm sure they would be delicious as well.

I made an apple cake recently that was too oily, so I liked the fact that this recipe uses butter instead of oil.  However, I found the batter extremely dry and hard to stir.  Mixing in the grated carrots was like kneading dough for bread.  I had to use four times the amount of juice called for and it was still very hard to stir.  I suppose it could have been because I used store-bought grated carrots, which are probably a little drier than freshly-grated carrots.  The end result wasn't too bad, but I think I will try an oil-based recipe next time.

Excellent recipe!  I used the juice of one fresh lemon instead of the orange juice.  I did not have any problem at all with the batter being too thick.  Be sure to thoroughly cream the butter and the sugars together -- this should take as much as 5 or 10 minutes using an electric beater.  (The color will change visibly to a much lighter shade than it was when you started creaming.)

I love the fact that it uses raisins and walnuts, plus when I make it the cake is so moist and delicious

Very disappointed compared to other carrot cake recipe that I could not find. This cake can be dry. I could tell by looking at the batter it was too dry so I added 1/2 can of crushed pineapple which helped. The icing recipe is a good one and especially since I added the other 1/2 of the can  of pineapple. There are better recipes out there, I suggest you choose one.

I found this cake way too dense for my tastes.  I agree w/ a previous poster that it was very hard to stir and came out almost like a carrot "bread".  I will not be making this again.    It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't the best carrot cake either.

I have not made this so I can't really comment on it too much but as a couple of other posters have said about it being dry I can see why if you're not using oil. The oil is where the moistness comes from. Carrot cakes are so supposed to be moist, not dry. I had to give it a rating or I couldn't post so that's why I chose the rating that I did.

Delicious! Make sure all ingredients are at room temp otherwise batter will be thick. I used low fat cream cheese, just as yummy. Check at 50 minutes so you don't over bake. Very good!

Yes I made it!! taste delicious.  However I too used lemon instead because I had no orange juice.  Left raisins and walnuts but put sliced almonds .  Next time would put more nuts and more carrot.  This was my first try and texture came out great.  I love it  although I did not do the frosting ..

My first time from scratch. This is very good, but a bit on the dry side. Added an extra dollop of icing and all was good. We live in a very dry climate, so I willl put the blame there.  I will make it again. Everyone loved it.

My family loved this recipe. It was very dense and moist but that is what made this recipe different and better then anyone I have ever used. And I too, agree, the icing is to die for. What I did do that could have made the icing amazing is, I whipped it for about 15 to 20 minutes. I have never had any icing that compared to this one.
