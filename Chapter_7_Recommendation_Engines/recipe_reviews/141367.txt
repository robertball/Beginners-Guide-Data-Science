It really needs cardamom to be authentic, in my opinion. I add a pinch of ground and it's much more to my taste.

I blended everything together, including the ice cubes, which I added last.  I used half as much sugar (good call I think) and Greek strawberry yogurt.  I also added fresh raspberries and a few drops of red food coloring to make it particularly pretty and pink.  Not that other, similar, smoothies are bad, but what I especially liked about this one was its simple berry flavor - no orange or cranberry juice, banana, or other flavor additions.  Hubs slurped this down in a New York Minute!

Cool, refreshing, healthy midday "pick me up" drink. Not too sweet. I did use agave nectar (syrup) instead of sugar, because agave is a low glycemic natural sweetener, which won't give you a sugar rush-then-crash. There was a nice strawberry taste, as I used most of the berries in the drink, with only a little chopped on top. I also mixed all the ingredients together at the same time.  I thought that  2 servings was just right for me as a single serving! Highly recommend.

I really love mango lassi, but wanted to make something a little less exotic for my husband, so this was perfect.  I felt like all the flavors were in good balance (not too yogurty, just right sweetness), and would diagree with the previous review that said it was not flavorful.  Of course, I was lucky to have big juicy summer strawberries, so maybe this could be a factor.

This drink lacked good strawberry flavor. I even added a few additional strawberries.  I did use 2% milk and agave in place of the honey for sweetness.  After tasting decided to drink it anyway and added 1 tsp. ground flaxseed, 1 tbls. soy protein powder.

I LOVED this recipe. Since I am a huge yogurt fan (love the tartness of yogurt), I'd cut the sugar to 1 TBSP. But, that is totally personal peference, understanding many aren't crazy about tart drinks like me. Thanks for sharing Radhika. A keeper for me!

Awesome!  As usual, because of my obsession with nutrition, I use conventional recipes as a place to start, and modify with more whole or local foods than those called for.  I used raw honey instead of sugar, frozen strawberries that I had bought at the farmer's market while in season, and raw milk and my own homemade raw milk yogurt (which is more liquified than conventional yogurt).  I ended up using less milk because of the viscosity of my yogurt, and no ice because the strawberries were already frozen.  It was fantastic!!

I loved this smoothie, but I had to make a couple of changes: I didn't use any sugar, I just added 1 scoop of protein supplement strawberry flavor and that sweet enought to my taste, I used frozen strawberries and fat free soy milk instead of whole milk. So delicious and refreshing I definitely will make this again.

The recipe wasn't like the Lassi at my local Indian Restaurant....It tasted more like liquid strawberry yogurt than anything...But it was good nonetheless.

We liked this.  I only had vanilla yogurt, so I didn't add any extra sugar.  I definitely recommend the cardamom as another reviewer suggested.  Otherwise it just tastes like a smoothie, yummy, but boring.

I thought it was pretty tasty, it could use a little something else like orange juice or another flavor of yogurt.

Firstly I would like to thank Rhianna who recommended this recipe to me via RE when I posted a request for a recipe to use up some strawberries.  The only changes I made was to use low fat peach yogurt in place of plain.  The taste was just what I was looking for, thank you for sharing.

Yum ! it is a simple and healthy drink. My kids love it.
I did some modification:
1. instead using sugar, I use date !!! you'll be amazed something so healthy can be so yummy.
2. I squeeze juice from half a lime.  The little tiny citric does add interesting favor.

This was great but the recipe was more of a smoothie than a lassi.  I added a spiced salt blend that I use for Raita and it worked out well.  Next time may add some cardamom as well to make it more authentic.

Really good. I didn't have much strawberries left so I only made one serving. It was just enough to fill me up :)  I think my kids would really like this one. Next time I may add a bit of banana. Thanks

Okay, I totally cheated on this one - I didn't have any strawberries, so instead I used strawberry yogurt with fruit pieces in it. Although not exactly the same, the lassi was delicious. Also, instead of ice, I just chilled the lassi in the freezer for a 5 minutes (enough to make it very cold and not frozen).

I started out making a different strawberry lassi recipe, but we didn't like it, so I kept tweaking until it was just right.  In the end it ended up with almost exactly the proportions of this recipe.  The only difference is that I double the amount of ice and blend it in with everything else.  So delicious!  We can never get enough of it!

I have been making this for a couple weeks now (since I got my daughter a smoothie machine) and didn't realize it!  I use 1 tablespoon of sugar, and aside from that one change I do pretty much by the recipe.  I don't particularly count and measure, though.  Today I followed the recipe, and found that it tasted the same as what I had been doing.  Great recipe!!!!!!

I really like this lassi. I subbed 2 pkts of Splenda for the sugar and used Greek yogurt. I used frozen strawberries, so I omitted the ice. It was refreshing and light. I made it as a Valentine's dessert.

Delicious! I added a half of a banana, used one cup of Vanilla low fat Stoneyfield yogurt (in place of greek) and one fourth of a cup of almond milk (in place of regular low fat milk). I also add my whey protien to the shake for pre and post work outs. Drink 1/2 of the shake before and the remainder after. I don't care for the taste of the whey  protien drink alone. Take my vitamins with amino acids before I drink the shake pre workout. Thanks for the recipe! Oh, I use a Stevia in place of sugar.

So great!  My kids and myself loved this recipe.  I would have never thought to make lassi with strawberries, but we love the mango version, and this one didn't disappoint.  Like another reviewer, I just blended ice with everything else, even tho that's not how we get it when we go out.  I just like it that way.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!
