I was skeptical about these, but there were pretty good! The butterscotch chips went well with the strawberry, which was a surprise. I would like to try these with regular chocolate chips sometime and compare them. Heads up, these are super sweet, so just know that going in, but they are fun and different too! Thanks for sharing. :)

I only had a 15.25 oz strawberry supreme cake mix and no butterscotch chips so I omitted that and I was skeptical at first too but they turned out perfect and looked just like the picture. I measured everything out precisely it irritates me when people donâ€™t measure. Next time I will add the white baking chips. Also I did not time them I baked till they looked right about 15 minutes.
