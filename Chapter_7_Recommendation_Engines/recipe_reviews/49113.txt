I tried this recipe recently and it is absolutely the best!  Everyone was very pleased with this tropical side.  I never thought of grilling bananas, but they were very good and the pineapple was delicious.  The sauce is just right: sweet with a little heat.  Excellent summer dish!

Great recipe, I used Dark Rum because it's all I had around, but still turned out fabulous.  Careful not to over-cook the bananas like I did, most of them got mushy and fell off the skewers.

Just made this for 6 people using 2 bananas, 1 1/2 mangoes and 3/4 pineapple, all cut into chunks and put on one skewer (MISTAKE-use two like the recipe recommends). It was very tasty & guests raved about the smell, but think doubling up on the sauce would make them even better.  As is, there was a slight rum/sweet/spice flavour. Doubling it up would be better.

We also microwaved the pineapple for about 4 minutes on high before threading. That way, they needed less time on the BBQ, and we wouldn't turn the bananas/mangoes to mush.

Loved the spicy kick. Very good but a bit more work than I expected due to the effort required to skewer the fruit.  I would cut the pineapple into discs next time and skip the skewer.
