I love this recipe....it's a great dip, although I made a few alterations.  
I left out the beans (didn't have any), cut the milk in half, and added black
olives.  YUM!!!

This was a great tasting recipe. I added the full 1 cup of milk, I added 1 1/2lbs of hamburger and a package of taco seasoning to the beef instead of using the sausage. I also used the full 15 oz. can of black beans and everything turned out perfect. I will definately be making this one again. Thanks Jeff!

Made this for several holiday and Football Parties.  Everyone loved it.  It is quite large so I started making just 1/2 the recipe.

Great recipe, but a couple of cautions to take into consideration: 1) I used spicey sausage, spicey salsa, and Mexican inspired diced tomatoes which created an EXTRA spicey dip (too spicey for me). I will use a few "regular" flavored items next time.  2) This recipe makes A LOT of dip as-is, be prepared for left-overs!

This is an awesome dip recipe!  I made a few alterations to tailor to the crowd I was cooking for who likes really spicy foods.  First, I halved the milk like most suggested.  I added one whole pound of spicy italian sausage instead of the 12 oz. of pork sausage, added fresh jalapenos, and added a can of diced tomatoes with habaneros.  Also, I used about 3-4 lbs. of cheddar cheese.  Everyone absolutely loved it!

Served this at the Super Bowl party tonight and it was a smash hit!!!!  I also cut the cheese in half and left everything else the same.  I added taco seasoning also and they all loved it! Will be making this again for sure! Thanks for sharing!!!

As is, the recipe is mild. Like others said, consider using spicy whatever (sausage, salsa, jalapenos) or add taco seasoning to it. I halved the cheese and milk amounts and left everything else the same and it still was cheesy enough, and plenty! If you find the dip a bit thin, let it cook longer. Thanks for sharing!

I made this for my boyfriends poker night. All the guys loved it. He brought my Crock Pot home empty!!  I used no onions, but used pico de gallo instead of salsa.

My guests really enjoyed this dip!!! I substituted the sausage with ground beef. I also added 1 pkg of taco seasoning. I recommend scaling down the recipe b/c it makes a lot.

I took this recipe to a tailgate party and it went over great!!!  I made 1/2 batch which still said served 40 and 6 of us pretty much finished it off.  To save time, I melted the cheese in the microwave, browned the meat on the stove and threw everything in together and refrigerated over night.  At the tailgate party, I just heated it up.  Will definitely make again.

Good stuff!!! I halved the recipe- but used the entire amount of sausage & beans. Also used slightly less than 1/2 c. milk. I would recommend using either 1/2 c. chopped onion OR the green onions- not both. Thanks for the recipe!

Dip was very runny and not very spicy.  I would cut out some of the milk and add spice.  We did not care for this dip very much and we have tons of leftovers!

Very tasty! A little thin at first, so be sure to let it cook for the hour stated. After that it thickened up nicely and was deliciuos over tortilla chips.

This recipe was good but next time I will try with olives as another reviewer suggested.  My husband loved the stuff and thought it was even better the next day.

Easy to make, tasted wonderful.  Took other peoples advice and put in a packet of taco seasoning, didn't put in onions (don't like them), made with ground deer meat, and it was a hit at our Super Bowl party!  Got asked for recipe a few times!

Thought this turned out great. It wasn't too thin for me. I used 3/4cup milk at first b/c I read others saying it was too runny, but then I had to add the other 1/4 cup milk later. Nice flavor too. I still have to cook it for another hour, but I think the sausage flavor will get stronger after an hour & it will be even better. Thanks

Delicious! I made this for a group of 25 and it was gone quickly. Great flavor and easy to make the night before, store in the fridge and plug in the slow cooker in the morning. I used green onion instead of white onion and omitted black beans as well as took the recommendation of another reviewer and reduced the milk to 3/4 cup. Tasty and better than regular cheese and sausage dip!
