First off, when you peel your shrimp save the shells and boil them in about 5 to 8 cups of water.  Bring to Boil and simmer for about 5 minutes then run through a strainer, reserving the water.  Use this water in the soup and you won't believe the difference.    I have been making a similar version to this soup for about 20 years.  However, this one takes the cake!  Other than the boiled shrimp shells I also left out the chicken and Ham.  I doubled the shrimp to 2lbs and also added about 1.5lbs of white fish filets that I'd cut into bite sized pieces.  Doesn't matter what kind of fish you use (just has to be white).  I bought whatever was on sale at the fish market.  Perfection in a bowl!  I also made the jalepeno cornbread recipe that I found on this side.  Crumble that into your bowl and it's amazing.  WONDERFUL recipe!  This is a must try for everyone.  I guarantee it will make it into your personal recipe book as it has mine.

This is one of the best jambalaya recipes I've made. The spices used and the chopped jalapenos give it a wonderful flavor & just the right amount of heat. I've made it with only the chicken and shrimp (leaving out the ham & sausage), which is my favorite. This is now a family favorite.

Very good, pretty easy to make, lots of improvising opportunities.  Needs more rice, though, to thicken the mixture.

This recipe got rave reviews at my Mardi Gras Party this year.  I doubled the shrimp and left out the ham and chicken.  Like other reviewers, I used 1.5 cups of rice and used a can of chicken broth and a can of water.  People called me the next day to get the recipe.

Loved it, loved it, loved it!  I am a cook who often tinkers with recipes as I follow along in the kitchen, but I left this one exactly as described.  My husband and I really enjoyed it, but the true test was when I offered some to my friend from Louisiana.  She said this Jambalaya was "very authentic" and "tasty", which is high praise from her, indeed!  Kudos!!!

What can I say?  AWESOME!!!  I will admit, I added a fresh, chopped habenero pepper for a little extra kick and used peeled and deveined cooked shrimp as a shortcut but wow!  This is a great recipe!  Quite a bit of prep work but it was well worth it.  I have already shared this recipe with all of my friends and will be making it often.

I scaled in half, used chorizo sausage, used chicken stock instead of water, added saffron shreds., left out the ham, used frozen cooked shrimp, added a little bit of minced habanaro instead of the hot sauce and jalapeno.  Very good.

This has to be the best Jambalaya recipe that I have come across!  It would be a great pot luck dish since it makes such a quantity. This makes a flavorful, hearty dinner!  Very, very good! Thanks for sharing this one!

This was the first time I had ever tried to make this dish.  This recipe is so much fun to make and a great starter recipe.  I did change and add some things...I used 2 lbs of shrimp, about 5 cups of chicken, one c water, one can red-sod chicken broth, 29 oz diced tomatoes, red, green and yellow bell peppers, 6 cups rice (the kind in the bag that you pop into the microwave...it was all we had) and chicken sausage...lower in fat and sodium.  It was really good.  My husband loved it.

An excellent jambalaya. Lots of great flavors working together. For those folks on a low carb diet just leave out the rice, cook it seperately and it can be added at the table. The taste is still great and it will please everybody.

This smelled wonderful cooking on the stove, and tasted just as great.  It was very simple, and definately worth all the chopping.  I put the tomatoes in a blender, since my husband and I don't care for them whole.  I also left out the shrimp, because I served it on the side with the remoulade sauce. I finished the meal with sweet Beignets. It was the perfect Mardi Gras meal!

Easy to make, tastes fine, but needs more rice.  I think it tastes better if you cook it for a while without the rice and then add the rice 20 minutes before you want it done.  That said, I've almost eaten the whole thing in two days, even though I forgot to add the shrimp!  (No one else in my household likes hot or spicy stuff.)

I made this recipe for New Years and it was a hit. I have tried to make jambalaya before and it came out mushy. I followed everyone's suggestions and used 1.5 cups of rice. I used Uncle Ben's Converted rice. I elimnated the ham and increased the shrimp to 2lbs and the chicken to 3 cups and used 1 can of chicken broth and reduced the water by one cup. It was not spicy enough so I added two teaspoons of Tony Chchere's cajun seasoning and it came out great. I highly recommend this one and will continue to make it

I made this for a party i had recently and ended up having to make a 2nd pot (everyone ran out and grabbed the ingredients to make more!!!).  I took out the jalapenos, and I used 1 whole smoked sausage along with 1lb of uncooked chorizo (which i sauteed first and removed before cooking the vegetables.)  I served it over rice instead of cooking it together and I added garlic powder and Cajun seasoning at the end.  What a recipe!

This was a very easy recipe. It was good not enought kick or spices for my families taste. I will kick it up a notch next time and I am sure it will be a family favorite. i made it to the exact directions. I did think it needed more rice but the next day reheating it, it was better and I felt the rice was fine. I might make it the night before we are going to eat it next time and reheat it and put the shrimp in then. I bet it will be awesome.

Really yummy.  I followed this recipe except I left out the jalapeno peppers -- personal preference (but I served them on the side for those that like it spicy). This was really good and very easy.  My family gave this a thumbs up - not an easy thing with two teenagers in the house!

A very tasty recipe.  After reading the reviews that suggested more rice could be added, I kicked up the rice to 1 1/2 cups instead of one.  I also followed the advice of another reviewer who said to let it simmer for a bit before adding the rice, so I simmered it for about 25 mins before adding the rice.  The combination of additional simmering and rice caused me to have to add about another cup of water during the course of the cooking.  The one other alteration was to double the cayenne pepper to 'kick it up a notch'...

We served this meal at a dinner party and it was a hit!  A couple changes: I was out of long-grain white rice, and used a box of Zatarain's red beans & rice, but kept water quantity the same.  Also used most of a large bag of Pictsweet's frozen pepper and onion mix (it saved on chopping).  Lastly, we splurged and used 1.5 lbs. shrimp.  Will definitely make again.

Very good meal.  I modified the recipe by omitting the ham, jalapenoes, and hot sauce.  I used italian sausage, 1.5 cups of brown rice, 1 can of tomato sauce and 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  My family prefers sweet over spicy.

I made this for a group of friends and it was a big hit.  I substitued spicy fresh sausage for the ham and used the tomotoes w/jalapeno and use Zataran's jumbalaya rice w/seasonings.  This was the first time I made this and was very glad I did.  Thanks for a great recipe

This jambalaya is absolutely delicious! I've tried several jambalaya recipes before, but this one turned out as a perfectly balanced blend of all the right flavours - nothing is stronger or weaker than it should be. My picky husband rates it a 10 out of 10. Today it's a 'cold to the bones' winter day here in Ontario, Canada and this dish was the perfect comfort food for us - it was a satisfying meal and it warmed us up after being outside most of the day. As well, it makes your home smell delicious and cosy! I will use this recipe again and again. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

A very good recipe.  I  made a half recipe, substituted chicken stock for the water.  Watch the amount of herbs, a touch too much will overpower the flavors.

This was very good, although I changed it so much my version hardly resembled the original.  Between this and another recipe on the site I created my own version.  First I precooked the shrimp and sausage, precooked and blackened the chicken and left out the ham.  I then added all the meat at the end and let it simmer a bit.  I also left out the green pepper and jalapeno pepper and used flavored canned tomatoes.  I put the hot pepper sauce on the table so my family could spice it up if they wanted, but I selected a spicer canned tomato so it really didn't need any more.  I made a seperate bowl of rice because I like a lot of rice in my jambalya and did not think there would be enough in the pot - there was.  THis will be part of my regular rotation.

This recipe has a wonderful flavor!  I followed others' advice and 1) cooked everything for an extra 20 minutes before adding the rice 2) used 1 and a 1/2 cups of rice.  I also eliminated the chicken and shrimp.  This is definitely a keeper, and rivals anything I've had in a restaurant!

This recipe didn't 'pop' like I expected it to - jambalaya with no butter?  I think diced tomatoes would have been better.  I used butter, chicken sausage, and dropped the ham entirely.  I also used chicken stock in place of the bouillon cubes.  It tastes nice enough, but the best part is the sausage, which would have tasted nice all on it's own.  There's just nothing special about this recipe.

I scaled this down to 6 servings. I picked out certain changes from each review. I used one can of chicken broth and 1 cup of water. I used one cup of rice and 1 8oz can of tomatoe sauce. This dish was great. The worst part of the recipe is chopping. Otherwise very good. Hubby loved it:)

My 12 year old son made this for Father's Day dinner with minimal assitance from me.  He used about 1/3 cup of jalapeno, plus a jalapeno flavored sausage since we like things really spicy.  It was delicious and very easy for a beginning cook.  It does make a LOT of food which is nice if you like to take leftovers to work for lunch!

Made this today and is was fantastic !! Full of flavor and spice. I modified the recipe slightly. Omitted the ham. Only used 1 cup of onions for 8 servings (not a big onion fan). I boiled the shrimp separately and  used the stock to replace the water for extra flavor. Next time I would add more rice. Would recommend for a pot luck. Next time I will make jalapeño cornbread to accompany this dish.

I've been making this recipe for about 12 years now. People are awestruck when they taste it. They think I am the best cook they know. LOL I might be but its nice to be told. I dont measure exact but I use all the ingredients except some other variation of bouillon powder as we dont have that kind here. Some times its hotter and some times its less hot but no matter what, even those who dont like hot food, cant resist it as it is so flavorful. You dont need any other Jambalaya recipe. This is the one.

I made this for a dinner party of 12. Incorporated many of the suggestions: using diced tomatoes, extra shrimp but no ham, chicken broth instead of bouillon, and let the rice cook longer. Served crusty french bread along with it. It was absolutely delicious and got rave reviews from all the guests.  I will definitely make again!

I made this for Mardi Gras.  My husband (who claimed before dinner that he wasn't hungry) had three servings because it was just so good!

I have had Jambalaya a few times and liked it  pretty well, but this Jambalaya is to die for and the aroma is to DIE for!  I made it almost exactly as written--I didn't have any basil and so left it out and put the rice on the side for some low-carbers in the group.  I made it the night before my party (except for the shrimp which I added a few minutes before serving) and the flavors were deliciously blended and everyone raved and raved about it.  I now have the job of making this jambalaya for an annual get-together of several friends!  It was spicey enough for those who like heat without killing those of us who don't like it super spicey!  My friends from New Orleans could not stop talking about this Jambalaya.  Mmmmmmm!

Outstanding combination. Makes enough for a whole week of leftovers and the next day after the flavors infuse it is even better as you would expect. Try about 1/2 cup more of rice and a little red wine while sauteing the sausage and add about a 1/2 cup to the pan also,,, lol. This is a definite keeper.

I love this recipe! I made a few changes, I used a little more garlic. Used 1 cup of jasmine rice and I was the perfect consistency! I also used smoked paprika (that's definitely just a personal preference). I used chicken stock instead of water. I also added a little more cayenne pepper. It was so flavorful! I was told by several people this was the best Jambalaya they've ever had!

This was a big hit!  I have a house of 6 boys and a husband who all loved it.  I eased back on the cayenne for the little ones sakes, but if you want an easy supper with 3 of four food groups present, try this!

One day a few weeks ago, my husband said "I've never had Jambalaya.  I'd like to try it sometime."  So, I used this recipe for my first attempt.  It was wonderful!!  The recipe is very easy to follow and the results are awesome.  Jambalaya will now appear on our weekly menu regularly.

I subbed 2 cups of chicken broth for the water and bouillon and used petite cut tomatoes instead. I also did not use the ham, but used more chicken and sausage. Everything came together perfectly.  Not to the fault of this recipe, next time I might not use smoked sausage, but plain instead.  I did not like the taste of what might be liquid smoke.

This was pretty easy and good.  The jalapeno was too spicy for us, so next time I'll leave it out.  I also used a can of chicken broth instead of the tablespoon of bouillon.  I also omitted the ham and chicken, and it was still a hardy meal.

I love the cuisine of New Orleans, so in light of the Katrina tragedy, I wanted our family to include some Bayou favorites on our Christmas menu. I modified the recipe by stewing a whole chicken with spices to create my own stock. I eliminated the ham and added more shrimp than the recipe calls for. This was definitely the show stopper, although the low country grits and shrimp were also a big hit, as were the fried catfish and orange cornbread. We never got around to the Bananas Foster.

Left out the ham and used instant rice. I had to add some cajun seasoning because it wasn't hot enough. I really like hot stuff.

Very yummy. I cut the recipe in half and adjusted some of the seasonings and used brown rice. It took longer than the recipe indicated to cook, due to using brown rice. I added diced tomatoes with chillies rather than stewed tomatoes. Quite spicy but we liked it. Will make again.

Pretty darned good! I did make some variations...I did not use ham. Instead of ham I added an extra cup of sausage and chicken breast. After cooking it it looked a little too thick for our personal tastes. I like it hearty but not so thick that there isn't any "sauce". I added 24 oz of chicken broth, and 16 oz of tomato sauce to give it a more tomato-ish base. It went over really well and there were barely any leftovers! (It makes a LOT!). I am giving it 5 stars even though it was pretty time consuming to chop/cut all of the ingredients.
