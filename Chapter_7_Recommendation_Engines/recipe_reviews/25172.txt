Do bother with the homemade mayo unlike the other person suggested. It's great!! Made this for a baby shower and printed out extra recipes because I knew I would need them to give away. Sure enough - I gave all of them out. Wonder flavors but you do have to like blue cheese. Recipe is good as is - no need to deviate. I have made this several times.

This is a wonderfully unique and flavorful recipe! I've made it several times. I have only needed little more than 1/2 cup olive oil to get to a consistency I like and still had a lot of mayo left over. Works well with wheat bread or just lettuce.

I made this recipe following it exactly.  The mayonnaise just tasted awful so I used regular mayonnaise (with a little sugar) and it all turned out great.  Really delicious.

Didn't bother with the homemade mayo; I also used canned chicken as a timesaver. I added dried tarragon and a lot more blue cheese. Just didn't get any of its flavor otherwise. Also added more grapes.

This was delicious!  ALthough, I did alter it a tad.  I used 2lbs of chic breasts, 1/2c lite mayo, 1/2c plain greek yogurt, 1/2 t dry mustard, the white wine vinegar, grapes and 1/2c blue cheese and added chopped red onions since I left out the pecans.  My husband doesn't like nuts.  I got TONS of compliments and many requests for the recipe.  We'll be making this one again!  Thanks!

I make this with Helmans mayonaise and can't keep it in the house!  My family loves it.  I'm looking forward to making it with leftover turkey after Thanksgiving to see how it compares with the chicken.  Its fast and easy to make and the flavors blend so well together.

I add craisins to this recipe which reminds me a bit of thanksgiving -- chicken and cranberry.  I have made at least 25 lbs. of this stuff since I discovered it a few months ago!  The family loves it.

Very easy recipe and tasty too, except I would not make the homemade mayo due to raw eggs and salmonella so I used a name brand mayo which worked just as well.  I gave it four stars!

I agree that the mayo wasn't very good. It was thin and didn't have much taste (besides being oily). The rest of the ingredients were great, though.

Yep, the homemade mayonnaise makes this. It took forever to make, but it came out delicious...however, DO NOT use just extra-virgin olive oil! I started out using extra-virgin because it was all I could find, and tasted it and it was WAY too strong. I ended up making up the difference with some canola oil I found, and that helped a lot. Also used some Danish blue cheese (my favorite!) and toasted the pecans before adding them. Forgot to buy grapes at the store, so I had to go without...maybe next time! My husband and I both tried a little bit with some crackers and it's delicious - looking forward to having it for lunch tomorrow at work on honey-oat bread. Yummy!

Absolutely wonderful but made adaptations! Nice texture and contrast of flavors makes this a fun salad. I especially loved serving it as a stuffed tomato recipe. I used Vegenaise http://www.followyourheart.com/vegenaise.html and a fat free blue cheese yet the texture was rich and creamy. Loved it!

Good but the mayo was off. I wouldn't recommend using olive oil at all - just use decent quality vegetable oil. I had to use a full cup and even a bit more as it just wasn't thickening up - or maybe I just don't know how to make mayo properly - who knows! But even with the very small amt of olive oil I used - it permeated the whole batch. To cover that up I added some curry powder and sugar. It was alright! I used 2 cups of grapes as well.

I did not use the mayonnaise recipe, I used sour cream.  I like this as a base recipe, but it had too much chicken and cheese.  It needed more vegetables.  I added 2 stalks of celery but should have used more.  I also only used 3/4 c blue cheese and it still had a pretty strong cheese flavor.

I have been making this recipe for years and always am asked for the recipe.  I don't make my own mayo (eggs and oil) I just use premade mayo.  It is a crowd pleaser!!

I have made this salad many times.  I use tarragon vinegar and add green apples.  It is truly delicious. I save time by using the breast of a barbecue Costco chicken.

This turned out amazing !  I made one change because I didn’t want to use that much olive oil. I substituted the olive oil mixture for half mayonnaise and half ranch dressing.  I also added three green onions chopped.

The mayo recipe was horrific, way way too much vinegar. However, the combo of chicken, pecans and blue cheese was delightful. I used regular store bought mayo. I will make it again. With regular mayo, it was delicious!
