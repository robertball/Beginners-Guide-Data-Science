I just made this soup for dinner and it was delicious! I added a couple of small peeled, chopped potatoes .  I didn't use feta garnish for total vegan meal and it was perfect. The easy Garam Masala  recipe from Kitchen Barbarian was a life saver for quick use. Thanks

Mmmmm! I wish I would have made a grilled cheese to go with this! A nice change from the usual tomato soup. The spices are perfect. I made the recipe exactly as written, except I was unsure whether to use dry or cooked lentils. I decided to go with cooked, and used a pack of Melissa's steamed lentils (about 1.5 cups - I used the whole package). It's not til after I made the soup that I decided to check ChefJorge's personal version of the recipe and I saw that he calls for DRIED/UNCOOKED lentils. This was omitted in the editing process. I imagine cooking the dry lentils in the broth would thicken the soup a bit. Mine was a little thin, but definitely not a bad thing. The flavor was amazing and I'll definitely be making this one again. I loved the added tang of the lemon, and saltiness of the feta. YUM! Thank you ChefJorge for the delicious recipe!

Great flavor!  Nice and spicey, the right amount of spice too!  I was alittle nervous with so much cinnamon but it was perfect.
Now I will make some scones to have with this soup.

I have never used red lentils and normally don't care for Indian spiced foods. I have no idea why I tried this recipe but I am glad I did. I made this soup exactly as written and it was delicious!

I followed the recipe but didn't have garam masala.  At first the aroma seemed a bit weird and strong so I didn't serve it to some friends.  A few days later, my husband and I had it and it was great!  Spicy, but not too much.  I used brown lentils since that is all I had so it had to be cooked longer, but it was very tasty!

I didn’t have the garam masala but substituted a little ground cloves, nutmeg, pepper and a bay leaf. Very interesting flavor and unique. I enjoyed and will make again!

Excellent recipe - definitely a keeper!  

This is a very flavorful dish.  Sweet-sour-spicy=yum!  Only thing I added was more tomatoes and a few more lentils and I always add Asian fish sauce to all my soups/stews for an umami boost (personal preference).  Nature's MSG.

I thinned mine with V-8 but tomato juice or more broth would work well too.  

PS make your own garam masala blend.

Very tasty. I'd add a little more spice and maybe a little more salt. A little chili garlic sauce did the trick for that.  But I like spicy food, so that's just me. 

Very solid recipe.

I made this quick and easy recipe.  I liked it lots and kept on eating it.   I did NOT add the lemon, or top with feta.   I don't know how lemon  would change the flavor.  ??  Anyone like it better with the lemon?  I will definitely try again on this soup in case I messed up the amount of cinnamon. Had a little too much cinnamon flavor.

I doubled the spices and added cumin. It was delicious! I like Indian spices a lot so it was perfect for us. I honestly thonk anyone can do that and be ok except the cayenne. Doubling the cayenne might be too much for children or sensitive palates.

I loved this soup.  I thought it had great flavor.  I did add salt to the dish, but other than that I made the recipe as is.  I was surprised by what a great touch the feta cheese was to the dish.  I look forward to making this dish again.

I made the recipe without any changes and it was marvelous.  I thought it was okay until I added the lemon which kicked up the flavors a notch, and when the feta was added (I know it sounds weird) it was perfect.  I will be making this again.

OK guys, a lovely recipe with lots of character and taste. But I have a real problem with the quantities shown for the ingredients that really create the taste (chile, paprika, cumin etc). The quantities as shown (1/2 teaspoon and such like) are  absolutely arbitrary. Some products will be very strong and others too weak (often dependent on how fresh they are. . The art of the chef is to get these quantities right on the basis of his chef's innate sense of 'how much is right'. My experience is men do this quite well, typically overdosing. The ladies tend to keep rigidly to the recipe.  A Brit in the West.

I think this is a good base. A tad boring as it is written (though certainly edible and I will eat it), and I followed the recipe to the letter. I think it needs more spice and a little salt, to start. Next time I'll also add some carrots, maybe some diced potatoes, and probably some sausage.

Very tasty and flavorful.  Quick to make, too. I think this goes well with yogurt rather than feta cheese.

So good!  I made exactly as called for, and after tasting I added additional cayenne and garam masala as we like things on the spicy side.   Will keep this recipe to make again.

The only change I made was the roux.  Couldn’t find a mix so made my own.
This receipt made a huge pot.  Next time I’ll cut in half.  There are only two of us.  My husband added hot sauce.
Healthy meal.

I used chicken broth instead of veggie, added celery to the onion, and passed on the feta. Really enjoyed this soup! Tasted even better the next day.  Great recipe. I’ll definitely be making this a lot.
