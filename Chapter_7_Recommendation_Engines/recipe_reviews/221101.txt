Mine came out awesome, but I did do some tweaking, so I gave 4 stars cause I'm not sure how it would have come out with my adjustments. Here's what I did--  first off, I cooked down the frozen strawberries for about 10-15 minutes then strained out the solids with a sieve, pressing out every precious drop of juice ( I had only about a 1/4 cup solids left to discard from about 24 oz berries) I was left with about 1/2 c strawberry reduction.  I used 1/2 c whole milk, 1.5 tsp vanilla, 1.5 tsp strawberry extract, 1/4 tsp red food coloring then with the eggs... I only used the whites, and rather than blending them into the milk mixture,I beat them (at room temp)  with an electric mixer/whisk attachment, till they had soft peaks and blended them in at the end, only for a short time till they were evenly blended, but not enough to chase out the air.  I baked mine in a 10 inch round wilton pan that is 3 in deep, so it took about 40 minutes to cook but will be thick enough to slice through the center to fill. this is THE lightest and airiest cake I've EVER made! Beautifully pink and strawberry flavored!

I am happy to be the first reviewer of this recipe! It is quite tasty and VERY rich. A small piece is plenty. The description of this cake says it is light. Though I followed the directions to the letter, my cake was rather heavy and dense. It also took much longer to bake than stated (about 35 minutes).  The cake does not have a strong strawberry flavor and the color is far from the usual pink color of most strawberry cakes. The frosting really makes the cake.

I made this recipe twice.
The first time, I made the cake exactly as the recipe specified, and I found the cake to be delicious and light, but somewhat lackluster in strawberry taste. My friends could hardly tell it was a strawberry cake, apart from the icing, which was store-bought strawberry.

The second time, I made the cake again in the exact same fashion, but put in considerably more strawberry purée (a little over 2 cups), and completely melted my butter before adding it (just added that to be fair, though I highly doubt it really changed anything). I also added a small handful of diced strawberry pieces to further accentuate the missing strawberry flavor.
I decided to actually make the recipe's icing this time as well.
The second yield was an enormous improvement over the first. So, as long as you make those small adjustments, this recipe is quite tasty and a strong recommendation.

The cake lacked flavour. The texture was eggy. Not as moist as I had hoped. Colour not appealing. Sorry I would not make this again.

Thanks to LDamien's advice about whisking the egg whites this cake came out nice and light. I also added the extra strawberry flavoring and didn't blend my strawberries completely so the cakes has some little strawberry pieces which makes it look really nice. Frosting is addictively delicious!

I haven't actually tried the cake yet, but it looks and smells fantastic.  However, with the addition of the 1/2 strawberry puree to the frosting, it's very thin.  I added about another 1/2 cup of powdered sugar, plus almost 1/2 cup of flour and some cream of tarter, but it's still pretty loose.

I made the cake portion of this recipe, with no changes except I only had AP flour not cake flour. I made cupcakes from the batter and they were delicious. Cooked for 20 minutes. They didn't have a strong strawberry flavor, but were moist. Will definitely make this recipe again, and might have to try the frosting next time.

Yum!  I made a sugar-free version using Just Like Sugar (baking version).  I also used blueberries instead of strawberries, and used a lot more purée than the recipe called for (omitting the milk as well).  It came out great!  Nice and buttery, and not "eggy" at all in my opinion (as was stated by some other reviewers).  The frosting is a little bitter due to the Just Like Sugar (I'll use powdered xylitol next time), but it's still good.  At least my husband & I like it -- we'll see what the kids at my daughter's b-day party tomorrow think of it.  Also I made this into cupcakes + one heart-shaped 8" (approx.) cake -- the blueberries resulted in a deep purple cake (so cool), and I'm frosting it pink, which shall certainly delight my very girly girl and her girly buddies.  And finally, I used cake flour, and it worked very well, though it's probably fine to use all-purpose or even whole-wheat if you wanted to.  I may try this again with almond flour -- since we normally eat low-carb -- though I wonder if it will hold its shape.  Still, fun for an out-of-the-ordinary birthday splurge.  :-D

Followed the recipe exactly and it was the heaviest, most dense cake I have ever  had. Not light and fluffy at all. The taste was ok, but not what we expected. Frosting was a winner, though!

When I made it it didn't rise properly and, although the others thought that it tasted great, I thought it tasted okay. The next time I make it I'll add 2 teaspoons of baking powder and 2 teaspoons of baking soda instead of 4 teaspoons of baking powder.

I used about 1.5 cups purée and 1.5 tsp strawberry extract. The flavor was really good, but the cake was too dense. I was disappointed for my birthday party guests that ate it. Not sure I’ll make this one again.

I don't know if it was the recipe or my ability at baking right now, I will come back a remake it once I have gotten a better understanding of how to make moist fluffy cakes.

I totally wasted my money on this recipe. The cake was heavy and a very dull color.

Too dense and not that great overall. Too complicated, too.

I made 1/2 recipe to test it out. I doubled the puréed strawberries as one person suggested. Halfway into the recipe I realized I only had whole wheat flour, so I added two Tbsp corn starch, removed two Tbsp of flour (per directions for substitute for cake flour) and sifted it. I added a little coloring. I didn't have high hopes, but kept going. I got 18 beautiful cupcakes. They came out very moist and not at all dense, but not light (as in cake mix) either. It is a good, homemade texture. The flavor is fruity (if not clearly strawberry), fresh and not overly sweet - it is a very nice cake. I may get some strawberry extract (and cake flour!) for next time. I think of the lack of strawberry flavor is due to March, imported berries. Good, local, ripe berries would make this amazing!
***update: it's the next day and this cake (even with whole wheat flour ) has a more delicious strawberry flavor and moist texture. I think it needed to sit for a day. I'll give it 5 stars.

This cake turned out terrible!  It was dense, thick and had the consistency of bread pudding.  I even took the advice of making it with egg whites, adding more milk, and cooking and pureeing the strawberries and it still turned out thick and dense.

I love this recipe! I've made it several times now. I don't know why the description calls it light and fluffy, because every time I've made it, it's very dense & rich -- that's my favorite part! The frosting is delish also. The flavor of the cake itself isn't super strawberry-y, especially if you're used to cakes with strawberry gelatin flavor, but it tastes great anyway, and after I decorate it with strawberry halves, it doesn't make much difference. It's great in thin slices with tea. One of my favorites!

This is a moderately tatsy cake, but to refer to it as strawberry is an overstatement. There is no real strawberry flavor to this cake, much to my disappointment.
