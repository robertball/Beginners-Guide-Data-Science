This was my first time making lamb... I was skeptical about the mint bc I dont like many things that are mint...I meal prep and even after reheating it--it was amazing. I used lamb loin chops bc I couldn't find shoulder and I looked all over town! Still was awesome! Would make a great romantic dinner! Followed the video exactly. Yum!

Very nice flavor combination with the marinade and then the sauce after they're grilled. I made it for a party of 10 adults, I used pork chops instead of lamb chops due to the cost difference for such a large group. Came our very nicely with pork instead. Everyone enjoyed them!
Marinated the meat overnight.

I made it for Easter , it went over very good. 
I always follow the recipe exactly as written, at least the first time unless a lot of reviews state they made the same changes.
This time I did add more cayenne, a  1/2 teaspoon and it was delicious. Thank you for sharing.

Well, I didn't exactly make it but I followed the seasonings to make ground lamb patties to serve gyro-style. I want to try it with the orange mint sauce as well.

Beyond! Strange combo of flavors make for phenomenal lamb chops. I cut back the cumin to one teaspoon for sensitive palates. My go to recipe for lamb chops. Don’t omit the mint!

I had a boneless leg of lamb that was already marinated in rosemary and garlic. I roasted the lamb and used this orange mint sauce. It was delicious! I will use this full recipe in the future.

This recipe is excellent! I have made it many times and is a go to recipe for a dinner party. I also like the sauce much better than mint jelly.

It was very good but not one of Chef Johns best recipes.  Next time  I will cut back a little on the garlic  and be certain to add some more Himalayan salt to both sides right before cooking.  I think the salt actually complements the orange mint glaze better if it goes on right before grilling.

I loved everything about this... except the cut of meat.  I want to try this again, but with a different cut that has less fat on it.  For some apparent reason, I cannot get my wife/daughter to enjoy fatty meats... :(  thank you again chef John!

The meal turned out perfect.  I did Oder a special mint sauce and mixed it with the Marmalade and spread it under the lamb chops and also garnished the top side.  I prefer the well done over the medium well done because it seemed like the meat was easier to cut from the bone.

Wonderful...I marinated the chops about 1.5 hours before grilling them. I did add Greek herbs from Pampared Chef and 2 TBSPS of Worcester shire sauce aside from a 1/4 of olive oil.... I did not have coriander....the finishing sauce was AMAZING...!!! Very tender lamb chops with great taste..Thank you for sharing your recipe!

Used curry powder instead of the separate spices and herbs, as it contained most of the same stuff. Didn't do the sauce, as I didn't have most of the ingredients. I'm sure it would add some wonderful dimensions, but the spice rub did a nice job by itself. Middle of February, so I used a grill pan on the stove instead of outdoor grill, but it worked fine at medium high heat.
