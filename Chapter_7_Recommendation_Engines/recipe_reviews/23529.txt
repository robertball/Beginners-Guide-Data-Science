The spices made the drink taste wonderful!  However, since the butter and the cider don't mix, the butter just floated on the top of the cider.  It didn't taste that good to drink in a sip of cider and get a mouthful of butter.  It coats your mouth and doesn't blend well with the cider.  I would omit the butter and just use the spices if I make this recipe again.  Also, I didn't use the maple syrup because I don't like to drink super sweet drinks.

This was pure Heaven!  I had never tasted hot apple cider and thought I would give this recipe a shot.  It looked very simple to make and I was extremely pleased with just how simple it truly was.  My husband tried it and has now made a rule to always keep this beverage on our menu, regardless of the weather!  Thank you so much, Karen.  You've made my husband and I a couple of apple cider addicts!  :)

This is the first time I had ever made my own hot cider, and it was great...with the exception that I wouldn't use the spiced butter. I agree with the comment left at 10/22/2002 that the spiced butter really doesn't do anything for the drink, but maybe only the spices could be used next time.  Other than that, it was really nice for my first!

This is some tasty stuff! I totally reworked prep though. I cut the recipe in half and combined the maple syrup and apple cider in a glass pyrex dish, and microwaved it for 1 minute. I couldn't understand the benefit of lugging out the slow cooker and waiting 20 minutes for it to warm up. Then, I just took a pat of butter, topped the drink with it,and sprinkled in allspice, nutmeg, and a heavy dash of cinnamon. Yum yum yum.

I have to say that the cider has good flavor, but not if you add the butter. If you add the butter, it doesn't mix with the cider. My Mother-in-Law and I tried this one night to see if it would warm up our winter blues... The butter makes it too sweet. I'd make it again, but without the butter.

I tried this recipe with a couple of friends for a tree decorating party....too too sweet.  We ended up diluting first with cider then with water.  Does anyone have a dilution suggestion?

This is like drinking warm apple pie!  Delicious!  I tripled the amount of cider but only used 1 cup of maple syrup.  Turned out great and has been enjoyed at several family and holiday get togethers!

I'm rating this a "4" because it *inspired* the recipe I evenutally made up from a bunch I've found on the www. The butter was NOT a problem and it was a huge hit among a diverse crowd of guests:

2 Gallons of Cider

Crush slightly and wrap in cheesecloth:
Cinnamon sticks
Green cardamom, pods removed
Star anise
Whole nutmeg
Cloves
Allspice (I didn't have any...)

Toss the packet in the cider.

Wash and puncture multiple times:
1 orange
1 lemon

Cut up and throw in:
Dried pears
Dried mangoes

Pour in about: 
1/2 cup maple syrup

Start it cooking slowly, and when it's hot, THEN throw in:

1/2 stick of UNSALTED butter

Then, just let it stew away. I started mine about 9 a.m. for a 2 p.m. holiday open house party.

The butter is just a creaminess in the rich spicy fruit. It wasn't too sweet because of the other fruits, and the spices didn't make it bitter because of the butter.

So, THANKS for the great recipe inspiration!

This was very good. I made it by the cup, so I only used 2 tsp maple syrup, 1 tsp butter and a dash of allspice and nutmeg.

My "unsweetened apple cider" tasted an awful lot like "sweetened apple juice" so I omitted the maple syrup. I also used more cider, having decided from the get-go that 16 oz of cider vs 1/2 cup butter would not work for me.  I've had a similar drink to this before done in the slow cooker, and the butter remains liquidy, though it never mixes in (it's still terrific). I did also add rum to mine, but it tasted good even before that. I do think cinnamon, ginger, and cloves would improve this drink and will add them in the future, because I do plan to make this again during this holiday season :) Thanks for the recipe!

Really good;really buttery;  But you may have meant to use more apple cider.  I did not even use the entire 1/2 c of butter.  that is a whole stick and it would have been way too much.  did you mean 64 ounces of cider?

I really liked this drink!  The first time I made this, I only used 1/4 cup maple syrup and thought that was a bit too sweet.  The second time I omitted the syrup altogether and liked it better that way.  The butter was perfect.  I used about 1/2 tsp. per cup, let it melt, and stirred well.  If you let it sit, yes, the butter floated to the surface and I can see how you might get a mouthful of butter.  Just give it another quick stir and it's all mixed up again.  I will be making this again next season!

Well, I combined two different recipes, using only the spiced-butter from this recipe.  I used the other apple cider recipe that got rave-reviews (and it was awesome - the one with the lemon and orange zest in cheese cloth).  The spiced butter from this was wonderful!!!  I used non-salted butter and it was fabulous.  I think the salt would detract from this a lot, but the non-salted butter just melted and left a yummy creamy taste to the cider that my guests could not stop talking about!  I was VERY pleased and had to hand out a lot of recipes that night!!

This didn't turn out well at all.  I followed the recipe exactly, but we could only taste the butter.  Also, the recipe says this serves 8, but it only made 2 cups?  Next time I'll try a simpler recipe which calls for cinnamon, no butter.

The butter make is so rich and is a nice contrast to the sweet. You have to stir it around before each sip. Very much worth the effort....Thank you for such a wonderful recipe!

I cut the recipe in half & only got two teacups full. I heated up my cider & maple syrup in the microwave (will decrease syrup next time...we thought it was wayyy too sweet) & then poured it into vintage teacups & used a teeny tiny whisk to whisk the butter in until it was well-blended. I cut the butter in half & made sure it was well-blended so I didn't have the buttery film problem others experienced. I added a capful of brandy to my cup & loved the addition. I think it helped cut the sweet, fruity taste some. Thansk Karen!

i heated the maple syrup and butter together in the microwave until it's nice and hot. stir it up well then add it to the crockpot. whenever i  make myself a cup i use the ladle to stir things up in the pot first, so if there happens to be a little butter here or there (there won't be if you do it like i do) just stir it up a little, sheesh. no reason to not enjoy the buttery goodness.

Wonderfully delicious. I bought some low-sugar apple drink and added half agave syrup with the maple syrup and spiked it with spiced rum. Outstanding on a cold night like this.

Ohhhhhh my goodness this is delicious!  We served a couple of gallons of it at a public event--the crock pot was totally emptied twice!  For the second batch I reduced the amount of butter and syrup because the sweetness was a bit overwhelming.  This definitely needs time to heat thoroughly so that the butter can mix with the cider.  It may even be helpful to heat the cider first, then microwave the butter and add it to the cider.  The butter will still separate after it sits for a minute, so the mixture needs to be stirred before serving.  The spices didn't dissolve completely so it was a bit gritty--I'm not sure if there is a way to get the spices to dissolve completely.  Having spoons or stir sticks ready would be a good idea.  The addition of the butter and syrup made a unique and delightful drink.  IMO, it was more appealing to me than most versions of apple cider, and apparently it was a hit since our customers drained the crock pot twice!

This was really tasty! I tripled the recipe but only added one cup of the maple syrup. Then I added the spice mixture as directed and it was a surprising just how good it is. I favor this over traditional mulled cider! Thanks for sharing your recipe! I'll be making this through the winter!!

I personally thought it was too sweet, but everyone at my party loved it! Next time I would definitely use less syrup.
