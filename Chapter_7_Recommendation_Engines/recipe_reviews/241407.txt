I was very skeptical of this recipe when I saw it. But I was looking for a side dish, and I wanted it to be like an unusual slaw. So I tried it. Am I ever glad I did. Yes, you do end up very red from grating beets, but it is worth the extra washing up. Skin, counters, dishes and sink all cleaned very easily. I didn't get any on my clothes, so no promises there! I used a homemade Dijon Mustard with Szechuan peppercorns, which seems to have worked well in this recipe. There is a tiny bit of heat from both the mustard and the garlic, but not overwhelming. I didn't realize how wonderful raw beets tasted. I will be making this one over and over again.

I like beets and they're so good for you. But I only knew of 1 or 2 ways to use them. So I was really happy to find this recipe. This turned out great! I've made it several times now.

This was very good. I must be honest that I used raspberry balsamic and dark balsamic vinegars as well as French honey-balsamic mustard and a German dijon made with red onions.  That's all I had on hand and three huge organic beets. I used a mandolin and after combining all of the ingredients I microwaved this mixture for 7 minutes until the beets softened up a bit, without being too 'cooked'. This was great.

This was terrific.  Love the fact that you get more nutritional value from using raw beets. Get some every 2 weeks from a farm share program, and wanted to make something in addition to pickled and roasted beets. This was great! Made it exactly as written. Don't forget the black pepper, as it seems to set off the other flavors. Just made it and without letting it sit in the fridge, it is already very very good. Think I'll top a lettuce leaf salad with them this evening. Great recipe, thanks!!

Our family loves this recipe - even those that normally don't like beets. I serve it frequently to guests and the reaction is usually surprise and then a recipe request. To make things easy I carefully chop the beets in my food processor. Sometimes I add a dash of honey. It is better if you first peel the beets, but I have made it both ways.

I didnt have dijon mustard so I subbed a tsp of yellow mustard and a tsp of worcestershire sauce. Used apple cider vinegar. Kind of tastes like a beet ceasar salad!

Easy, quick, and tasty. The raw beets are pleasantly crunchy. I'll make this again.

Never made anything with raw beets, (and I love roasted and pickled beets) so I HAD to give this a try. I added cut up leftover chicken breast and some tiny fresh mozzarella balls. Let the flavors blend a little before serving. Will definitely make again!

I too was sceptical about the raw Beet thing, but this is delicious. I pretty much stuck with the recipe, but as the author did, added stuff I had on hand. I added an onion and an apple. I had Rosemary Olive Oil which went well with all the other flavors. will be making this again.

Love this delicious salad. When I'm in a hurry I just add some vinaigrette and the sweet and tangy is awesome. My favorite so far is wishbone Greek viniagrette (not promoting, just like it) lol.

I made no changes and I did not microwave the beets at all as I love the super crunch!  Be sure to let it sit a while to well marinate the beets. Definitely will make this again!

This is so tasty!  I spiralized the beets and then chopped them into smaller pieces.  I also split the balsamic vinegar with rasberry balsamic.  It was so refreshing!

I'm not a beet lover but this was delicious. Reminds me of a pretty Coleslaw.  Only substitute was parsley flakes for fresh.

This is delicious and refreshing - I used yellow beets and white balsamic vinegar and just a tiny bit of garlic,  The dish emptied fast at our barbecue.

This was very flavorful. I did substitute cilantro for the parsley because it is what I had on hand.  Each family member commented positively on this recipe so it will definitely be repeated.

I just had to try this after reading the great reviews. I have been looking for ways to use beets and found a keeper.  The only thing I changed was to mix apple cider vineyard and red wine vinegar.  I didn't have any balsamic but am definitely putting in on my list. 
Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!

Very tasty! The balsamic and mustard add a little punch to the earthy beets. I used garlic powder because I don't care for raw garlic.  I'm looking forward to the leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

Excellent tasting salad served with a boiled egg, slice of sourdough and cheese for a perfect luncheon with a business associate. It was a hit.

These was a very good cold beet salad. I am Polish so beet salad is a favorite among Poles so I did make a change. Polish cooking uses plain white vinegar so I substituted that in place of the balsamic vinegar and added two more tablespoons and one more tablespoon of olive oil. I also did not add parsley something you would not see in Polish beet salad. My husband and I loved it and I would make it again.

I am not a person who eats beets. I wanted to try the recipe since it was raw and I know that there are a lot of really good health benefits to eating beets. I was very pleasantly surprised. I guess I like beets after all. I made the recipe just as it was originally written.

We love beets and even like raw beets but we just could not eat this.  I think this is not for Southern taste buds.  I made it by the recipe and really tried to like it but just couldn't.

Made as instructed. A nice slaw type relish; good on sandwiches (try roast pork). Or as a side dish.

No I didn't make any changes. I might try backing off the balsamic vinegar a little as it sees a little tart for this dressing. Or add a little sweetener.

I used raw red wine vinegar, spicy mustard, and fresh parsley.  It wasn't so disgusting I couldn't gag it down, but rather ate it out of obligation so as to not waste money.  Was not appetizing.  Did not enjoy the taste.

I made this for Mother's Day for my mother in law...she LOVES beets. I was a bit hesitant to try this just because I've never had beets; well after making this not only do I like beets now, but my kids do too!

Very good and I'm not crazy about beets!  I normally don't have parsley, so I replaced it with cilantro and lime juice instead of balsamic vinegar

I had another recipe for beets so I bought the only ones I found at the store.  Then I decided not to use the recipe.  I found this and it was so easy.  I was surprised when I grated the beets and they were yellow so I don't know what kind these were.  I didn't have parsley so I substituted some chives.  My husband loved them.  He grew up on German food and tons of food with vinegar.  He has asked for this again.  Oh I forgot to put in the mustard.

This was an excellent and different way to use beets! We had not ever eaten them raw and they were excellent.  The only change i made was I tosses the slaw and dressing together let it sit for a little bit and then tossed that mix in with the chopped up beet greens and made a nice salad.  The beet greens are just as yummy as the beet so I don't waste them.
