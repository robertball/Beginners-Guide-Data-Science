I followed this recipe exactly..I had high hopes but was dissappointed. Took it to a BBQ and it was eaten by a couple of people but unlike everything else I took, I had to bring the pan back full. I decided maybe I should taste it myself to see the deal. The orange part had a decent flavor, but the crust was NOT good. It was very gritty and didn't go with the filling. I do not think I will make it again.

I made this recipe for a family gathering.  Everyone really liked it!!!  Next time I might try making it with a graham cracker crust just for something different.  I used two 14 oz. cans of mandarin oranges in my recipe!!  Delicious!!!

I looked up this recipe because I had too many cans of mandarin oranges in my pantry.  Looking at all the good reviews I thought this was definetly going to be a hit!  Unless I did something incredibly wrong -which doesn't seem possible because my sister and I both made this together, this came out inedible.  It was too sweet, almost tasted like someone poored sugar all over it, ruining any hope of something edible.  I followed the directions and unfortunately came up with something that had to be thrown away that same night. (AND I'M EASY TO PLEASE!)

Very good!!! I have grew up with this salad and it is always a hit!!! Couple hints, the individuals who thought the orange taste was too strong....this calls for a 6oz can of concentrate, most are 12 oz, so if you're putting in the whole can, then that is why the taste is so strong. Also, I only put in about 3/4 can. of condensed milk due to the sweetness, use brown sugar in the crust, and 2 cans of 16oz. oranges.  Hopefully this will help!! Thanks again for the post!!!

This was pretty good. I thought the orange taste was a little strong so next time I will only use half a can of concentrate.

I used a 12 oz. can of orange juice by mistake, so mine was a little tart, but still good.  I can't wait to make it the right way!  I'm sure it will be delicious.  The crust was awesome!  Thanks for the recipe.

Love this bright creamy orange salad. Could be dessert or salad. Does tend to be sweet but the salted butter crackers balance the flavor a bit. I put a bit more concentrate in mine and two 14 oz oranges. Surprise everyone with this salad tonight, they will ask for it again. Also, lighter versions of ingredients like fat free or low fat work fine in this recipe and shave off some calories.

12-05-15 ~ Made this salad for Christmas 2015. It is very good and it was very well received, but it is really, really sweet. I did mix the crust indigents and pressed in the 13x9 pan and then I baked it at 350° for 10 minutes. I wanted the crust to stick together like pretzel salad crust does. It is best served with a spoon as it doesn't set up enough to serve in squares. If you like the taste of orange, this is a good salad for you to try.

Have made this recipe for several years now. It never disappoints!! I am so glad that I could find it here on; AllRecipes.com. I had given up trying to find my old cookbook that I first found it in! :)
