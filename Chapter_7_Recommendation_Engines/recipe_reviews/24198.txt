This is a great recipe. This past Thanksgiving, I decided to make several different kinds of pumpkin pies. This one was the overall favorite. I couldn't find toffee baking bits, so I improvised using Werther's Originals candies, that I broke up in tiny pieces. They got nice and gooey.

I didn't really notice the toffee like I thought I would.  I added extra spices because I like a spicy pumpkin pie.  It was tasty but I'm not sure it was any different then a regular pumpkin pie.  I did notice the toffee gave it a little bit of a nutty flavor though.

LOVE IT!!! Had several organic fresh sweet pumpkins and needed a recipe that would fit my taste since I am not a huge fan of pumpkin - found this recipe and decided to give it a try ...I decided to make pie and mini-tarts as well! Just fabulous...right balance of spice and sweet! Definitely a keeper!

I made it with milk substitutes since one of my company cannot eat anything from a cow.  It was good, but we both thought it was too sweet so I would add less sugar next time,

This recipe is tasty and easy to make. I didn't have a hand mixer, so we just whisked it together and it worked fine. I used the Keebler mini Graham Cracker Ready Pie Crusts with the same recipe for the 9 inch pie and it filled about 18 of them. I baked them for 60 minutes, but that was too long for the graham cracker crusts. I would say try baking them for 45 minutes and see how they're doing and add 5 minutes until they're done.  The recipe above was good and I would say you can reduce the sugar just slightly if you don't like things too sweet. I also substituted So Delicious Coconut Milk instead of regular cow milk and it worked grreat. I would make this again and I think I would try a different sweetener like coconut sugar to see how it tastes. We generally don't like super sweet desserts.
