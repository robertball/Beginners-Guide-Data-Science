Every once in awhile a recipe completely takes you by surprise, this is one of those recipes. We love to grill and are always looking for a new grilling recipe. I did half the recipe for just the two of us. I pretty much followed the recipe except did put some ground pepper and a bit of Old Bay along with the salt on the fish. The cooking instructions were a bit confusing, so we cooked at 350Â°, over indirect heat for 15 minutes and then turned the pan for ten more minutes. The fish and vegetables were perfectly done in the 25 minutes. Simmering in the medley of vegetables gave such a wonderful flavor to the Tilapia. My husband took one bite and said, "this is amazing". This was also pretty simple to put together, served over Ann's rice pilaf on AR.  We will make this one again. Perfect summer grilling recipe. Update: We have made this  many times now using our cast iron skillet with foil covering, a favorite when were camping. Works with other fish also.

I loved the ingredients in this recipe, but my husband and I thought it was a bit bland the first time I made it (we love spicy/foreign foods). I also always replace butter with coconut oil, for zero cholesterol. The second time I made it, I added a half teaspoon of white pepper, a teaspoon of old bay, 10 sliced Spanish olives and teaspoon of hot sauce. I also made jasmine rice and replaced the water with chicken broth, so it has more flavor alone. We topped the rice with the fish mixture, and we both loved it.

It was off the charts good. I added some lemon pepper and "daves famous rib rub" on the fish because I thought the fillets needed a more flavor. I dont think I put enough cilantro but the dish still came out very good. Make sure to blanket the dish with celantro.

This is a pretty dish when served with either crusty bread or pasta/rice. I chose to serve with fresh crusty bread.  I made half a recipe, lightly seasoned the tilapia loins with a bit of salt, pepper and a sprinkle of garlic (along with the lime juice), then added the mixture of bell peppers, onions, tomatoes, jalapeno and cilantro (which I didn't measure, just used about 1/3rd of a small bunch), fishing off with the rest of the lime. It was pouring outside, so I baked in the oven, figuring 350 was about medium heat on the grill.  WRONG!  After 20 minutes, the vegetables were still very crunchy and not even warm.  Turned the heat up to 400 and cooked for another 20 minutes which wasn't quite long enough to cook the fish throughout.  But another 5 minutes and the fish was done, but the bell peppers were still kind of crunchy.  Next time I'll very thinly slice the bell peppers so they cook faster and plan on cooking at least 30 minutes at 400 before checking.  Now tilapia loins are thicker than fresh tilapia, so perhaps that explains the cooking time difference.  We did enjoy it though and will have again, perhaps with fresno peppers for a slightly different taste.  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe was amazing! Our entree of choice is fish so I'm always looking for easy and new ways to prepare it. I will definitely use this recipe again. I did add shrimp to it, and placed the fish on a bed of Spanish rice because I was out of wild rice. It was delicious!! Thank you for sharing your husbands recipe!!
