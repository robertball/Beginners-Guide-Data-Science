Loved this recipe! One thing I wanted to mention is that I added mushrooms to the mix because I think they go hand in hand with snap peas. Again, the recipe turned out perfect for me BUT I do feel it would be a bit too oily as written without the shrooms to soak up some of the oil. You can always add more oil so if I ever do it without the mushrooms, I will start with 1 tsp. of the sesame oil and go from there.

Just a bit oily...will cut back a little on the oil the next time.  We enjoyed these snap peas, and they really are a snap to prepare (no pun intended).

I think the flavors were too overpowering for the snap peas. I'll just keep making my snap peas more simply.

I omitted the chili oil because I don't like spicy food- but crisp and excellent!

This was good, but when I added the garlic and onions and sauted all together I was told it tasted "bitter".  I enjoyed it, but my company didn't.  Oh well, lesson learned.

I didn't have chili oil so I added some Tabasco to grapeseed  oil.  I also added 1 clove of minced garlic.  Yum! Side dish for miso glazed salmon.

Excellent side dish to baked teriyaki chicken and rice! I added a couple of cloves of minced garlic simply because we love garlic. So simple to make as well. Will definitely be making again.
