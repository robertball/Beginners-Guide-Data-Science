I got a similar recipe from a newspaper. It's really good without the wine vinegar, just a little more olive oil and use rotini instead of fettuccini - it catches the flavors better. In addition, I used one wedge of regular brie and one herbed one.  YUMMY!!! And if you are a garlic lover like me, add more!

I scaled back to 4 servings.  Used only a pinch of black pepper and fresh picked roma tomatoes. I love brie and this adds a wonderful flavor to this dish! The second time I made this pasta, I used penne, which made it easier to eat! Added fresh roma and heirloom tomatoes! Soooo Good!!

I LOVE this recipe with a few changes. I saute the garlic because I don't like it raw, to which I add some chopped onion and some red pepper flakes. I substitute balsamic vinegar for the red wine vinegar. I never would have thought that brie would would work so well with pasta!

"AWSOME" this is the pasta i've been looking for, has a taste all of it's own. Not 
your typical alfredo pasta. I love it and so does my family. Thanks Lisa for our 
new favorite!!!!
If you don't try it you are missing out on something great.

Awesome.  I'll likely roast or saute the garlic next time.   It was a bit strong.  Great summer dish to use basil and tomatoes from the garden.

I would give this 3 1/2 stars. It did quite have the punch I expected it to have. I cut the oil in half added about half of a pint of halved grape tomatoes and used a half of a head of roasted garlic from a recipe I found from this site. I'm glad I added the extra garlic otherwise it would have been to lifeless.  I think I'll stick to making bruschetta and adding that over pasta.

I think if I had waited to make this dish in the summertime, it would have been a 5 star one. Since I made it in wintertime, in Wisconsin, I realize that the tomatoes and basil that I used were probably not top quality, and this is the kind of dish the requires every element to be at the peak of freshness. I'm going to store this one away and try it again during tomato season and re-review.

This recipe is similar in style to "Fire and Ice Pasta."  Although I prefer the latter, my husband liked them both equally.  A good quick and flavorful pasta.  Cheers.

Wonderful.  Made it for a friend and we both thought it was unbelievably fresh and flavorful.  Loved how the brie just melted into the pasta.  So easy to throw together too.  Has already made it to my recipe box.  Can't wait to make it again soon...  Thanks Lisa!

ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!  Even my finicky son liked it.  It is light and extremely pleasing to the palate.  I substituted freshly grated romano for a lighter touch.  FABULOUS!!!!

I enjoyed this recipe. After reading reviews, I chopped TONS of garlic and added to the marinade. (Also cut the recipe in half to serve 4) I made this for me and my husband. He prefers red sauce for pasta, so he would prefer red over this clear/white sauce. However, he enjoyed it (except too much garlic - my fault). I enjoyed and will make again. I would probably add shrimp or scallops or chicken when making again.... =D

I made this tonight for my sister's birthday dinner and it was very well received!  I didn't change anything except to use balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar and capellini instead of the fettuccine.  I think good quality ingredients like good Brie and garden fresh tomatoes are the keys to this recipe.  I'll be making this every summer when the tomatoes and basil are in season.

One of the best, most refreshing meals I've made from AR.  Loved the taste of the fresh tomatoes (I didn't bother seeding them) and fresh basil.  I had never purchased Brie cheese before, and it was delicious in this dish.  It melted just enough to make the dish creamy, but leaving cubes to taste.  We ate this hot the first night and I had it as a cold pasta salad the next day.  It was great both ways.  I fixed this for our 24th wedding anniversary.  This is definitely a keeper in our house.

I LOVE this dish! I made it with mini penne pasta, used two tomatoes instead of four, used a little bit less of the brie and less of the basil and it was still amazing and one of my favorite pasta dishes now. Will definitely make again.

This is a very good pasta salad. Thanks for sharing. I gave it 4 stars because I think the fettuccine is awkward. I will make it again but use a smaller noodle like a rotini. Also, I did not like it warm because it was too oily - it is best served cold, imo, when the noodles can soak up all the wonderful flavors.  The fresh basil an tomatoes were wonderful!

Loved it but made a few small changes, as usual, based on what I had on hand. I used chopped spinach instead of basil and doubled the amount and rice vinegar instead of red wine. Otherwise followed the recipe and it is definitely a repeat!

This was very good and a nice fresh dish. I used more basil than the recipe called for, used Rotini instead of fettuccini (as someone else recommended) and threw in some peeled and deveined shrimp with the pasta as it cooked. Everyone loved it.

This was DELICIOUS!!! I made 2 small changes to this recipe: 1) cooked the garlic in the olive oil 2) added grilled chicken breast pieces. I couldn't believe how good and easy this was. It tasted better and fresher than anything I've had at a restaurant. I will be making this a lot!

This recipe was okay.  We followed it but had a few less tomatoes but I don't think that would make a difference.  Using the same flavors, I much prefer"Tuscany Pasta Toss" from the Pillsbury website that tosses hot pasta with chopped tomatoes, garlic, basil, mushrooms, walnuts, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and blue cheese.  There is no equal comparison between the two.

This was fantastic! My hubby & I had never tried brie before. We tasted it straight out of the package & didn't like it very well. But when prepared with this recipe we loved it! Definitely a keeper! So easy too!

I love brie.  I love pasta.  I love basil.  But this was just ok.  It felt like a waste of expensive cheese, and I wished I had used it for something better.

Tasted a little to bland for me, I think were I to make it again I would up the basil and brie substantially. It makes for a pretty healthy meal, just doesn't have enough of a taste for me as is written.

I think next time I'll use less oil, but, regardless, it was fantastic! I actually warmed the whole dish in the oven for about 30 min. on about 225 to melt the brie.  Wonderful!

This was so tasty.  I made this as a last minute meal and only have 20 minutes, so I put the sauce ingredients in a pan on low.  I also didn't have any fettuccine so I used rotini.

I didn't have time to marinate for the 1 or 2 hours but it was still yummy! I didn't have fresh basil either so I used the frozen cubes of basil from Trader Joe's instead. I also added in some asparagus and a lot more garlic. Will definitely make again!

Family enjoyed this.  Great with garden tomatoes.  Added calamata olives, sundried tomatoes and substituted brie with low fat cream cheese.  Made sure to toss everything together in the hot pasta pan.  Great left over.  Might try goat cheese next.

First five star rating I have given out on this site.  

Would I make this again?  Yes

Would I do it differently?  Yes but only from time to time, maybe throw in some crumbled bacon or chopped polenta.  

Using brie in this format is ingenious.  Beats mac and cheese by a mile.

This was terrific! I added the shrimp as suggested in another review and topped it with crumbled cooked bacon- YUM!  The only fault I found was it was a little oily- definitley will cut it to 1/3 cup next time.

SO GOOD! It's my husband's favorite. Very easy and tastes wonderful. Sometimes I add grilled chicken to add some meat.

We really liked this recipe but thought it could do with a couple of adjustments the next time around. It is a HIGH fat dish, and would probably taste just as nice with less olive oil and about half the required amount of Brie. We'll see next time!

This was yummy! I used goat cheese though because, although I love brie, I didn't know if I would like it in pasta.I found that simply tossing the noodles in the room temp"sauce" didn't make it hot enough so you may need to heat it through.

Came out way too thick - cheese coagulated very easily. Tasty when it was still hot but got pretty nasty once it started to cool down.

I made this recipe for a family get-together of both adults and kids.  The adults loved it -- all the cooks wanted the receipe.  It was easy and quick to make and by marinating the brie for about 3-4 hours it became creamy enough to lightly coat the pasta without being too heavy.  I would defintely make it again!!

Delicious!  I was looking for a simple recipe to compliment a pricey reginette pasta that I splurged on during a weak moment ($12 for a small box, what was I thinking!).  This recipe is perfect as is, the only thing I changed was using roasted garlic instead of minced (for a more subtle flavour) and parmesan flakes instead of grated.  No need for exotic flavoured pasta with this recipe.  Can't wait to use fresh garden tomatoes next time!

This is my all time favorite from this site. I sometimes change the vinegar to balsamic and add sautéed shrimp or chicken to the recipe. It's my go to meal when I don't want to fuss around all day but still want something that tastes like I did. Love love love it !!

Very good. I added extra garlic and some plain yogurt to substitute some creaminess since I didn't quite have enough brie. I used half the oil called for and I still did not like all the oil in this recipe. I will look for an oil substitute. Suggestions welcome!!

This pasta dish was wonderful! Delicious when served hot or cold as left-overs! I think I may also try to substitue feta for the parmesan next time, just for something different. What a great dish!

I'm pleasantly surprised.  In all fairness I had to make quite a few changes but I did try sticking to the recipes as much as I could it's really tasty.  I used goat cheese instead of Brie, warmed it up on the stove and added the garlic (because I was starving and another reviewer suggested it, thank you!)  Ultimately I left out the oil and vinegar because the goat cheese is so nice an creamy that it wasn't needed.  So...I'm sorry for rating this when I changed the recipe, but I have to say that it's a nice base recipe that seems to be easily adjustable to whatever you have on hand.

I was looking for a recipe to use some brie leftover from a party and this looked very appealing.  It was very easy to make and came together quickly.  I was out of red wine vinegar and so used balsamic which provided a wonderful flavor.  I plan on using even more vinegar next time.  I sauteed some shrimp in garlic, fresh parsley and white wine to serve alongside and it was a nice compliment but not neccessary.  My husband found the brie favor bitter though he enjoyed it immensely.  I am going to try this fontina and cheddar next, as the basic concept would work with so many cheeses.  This will be added to our menu with many thanks!

Made this for dinner last night. Used cherry tomatoes halved.  Added shrimp which I sauteed with a second clove of minced garlic.  Overall, very tasty.  Will make again when we have extra Brie, which is not too often.

We loved this one with some changes.  I used 1 can diced tomatoes, about 1/2 cup feta cheese with basil and sundried tomatoes and about 1/2 cut goat cheese (I love goat cheese).  I also used whole wheat penne pasta.  I sauteed about 1 pound shrimp in 1 Tbls. olive oil and 1 Tbls. butter seasoned with lemon juice garlic powder and Cavenders.  When the pasta was done, I put the shrimp and tomato mixture in the pot with the drained pasta and mixed togeter.  Served with a sprinkle of goat cheese and extra basil.  I agree with one of the other reviews that crumbled bacon on top would be a nice touch.  It was delicious!!!  I also think it would be good with seasoned grilled chichen.  I'll definitely do this one again.

This is a great recipe. My husband and I have made this when having people round to dinner. It's so fast so we can easily make it after work. The only thing to change may be using less oil because with the cheese and oil it can get a bit greasy. But as a whole Beautiful dish!!!!

I love this recipe. I originally found it from a friend but recently saw it on here. I use the gemeli pasta instead. In the summer I use fresh tomatoes from Jersey but right now they arent in season so I used the diced can tomatoes and they work just as well. Delicious and very easy to make

I realize I am in the minority about how I feel re this recipe.   Used very fresh ingredients (grow my own herbs). good brie and lots of garlic, but to us it did not have much taste.   Perhaps we prefer pasta with a hot sauce and more creamy.   Perhaps using pesto would be more to our liking.   
Anyway, it is not for us, unfortunately.

My mom has made this recipe for years and it is now a summer favorite in my own household.  The brie cheese melts on the hot fettuccini and there is nothing that says "summer" like fresh, ripe tomatoes and basil.  If there is any leftovers, I like to put the mixture on toasted french bread for a quick lunch the next day!

At the last moment, I realized I didn't have any fresh basil!  Otherwise,  I followed the recipe.  I love fresh tomatoes, and those made the recipe.

However, it hit my tastes, but was otherwise average.  I might make it again for me, but probably not company (the ultimate test).

This was good - but I'm not sure I would make again - the brie didn't seem right - I might use goat cheese next time.  I used angel hair pasta instead also.

We liked this alot - tastes good and looks beautiful!  The brie cheese was a nice change and goes well with the tomatoes.  I added a little extra garlic and some cooked shrimp but I am sure it would be just as good without.

I wasn't a fan of this.  I love all the ingrediants, but the brie was too strange for me. I didn't think the flavors complimented each other at all.  There is another recipe almost the same, but with mozarella that I did really like.  I'm giving this two stars because my French boyfriend loved it.  Although he ate a big portion, and that much brie made him feel ill.  So I don't think we'll be making this again.  Sorry...

Very good.  I would use a little less oil, and a bit more vinegar next time.  Tomatoes taste so good after marinating!

The sauce really adds a summer fresh taste to Pasta.  This has become one of our favorites to make anytime of the year.  Best of all, no heating required so our young-ones can make it with us from beginning to end. I find that Plum tomatoes work best and that in the winter months using frozen basil leaves and vine-ripe tomatoes from the store can bring back that summer fresh taste.

I made this dish for a womens night and it was a hit.
Everyone wanted the recipe. I heated the pasta in the microwave for a few mins
so the Brie melted over the pasta. This dish is absolutley delicious. I will make it
over and over.

I did not like the raw tomatoes and garlic over the pasta. I might try this again with these ingredients but use a very different approach. I would cook the garlic in the olive oil, add the tomatoes and cook it down a while. I would then add the basil and brie with the salt and pepper to make a sauce. I would skip the vinegar (didn't add anything to the taste).

Would be 5 star had I access to fresh home grown tomatoes. Even with the store-bought tasteless ones, it was pretty good! Will make again with better tomatoes.

So simple and delicious. I normally would use feta or Parmesan in combination with tomatoes and basil, but the marinated Brie was so delicious and melted beautifully into the hot pasta.

This was very good. I used an herbed brie, and also fresh tomatoes and basil from the garden. It turned out great.

This was so delicious.  I used Roma tomatoes and held off on the garlic.  Added thin sliced chicken breast cooked in a batter of Parmesan cheese, basil, tyme, minced garlic, and sage - sautéed in olive oil on the stove top 5 min each side.  This is one of our new favs.  Gonna try it again with a mixture of shrimp and chicken.  YUM

This is amazing! Used tri-coloured fettuccini, already cooked (tomato, spinach & egg) which only took 4 mins to cook. Used twice as much parmesan & fresh corn kernels. Delightful to look at & delicious!
