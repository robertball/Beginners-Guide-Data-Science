I needed graham cracker crumbs and since it was the only graham cracker recipe that did not ask for whole wheat flour, I tried it. I doubled the cinnamon, but except for that, I followed the recipe. I used light brown sugar but I think dark would give more flavor and a deeper color. Since I needed crumbs and not cookies, I just rolled out the dough and did not cut it in pieces. Big mistake! The outside got crunchy but the middle remained chewy. So I cut the middle part in pieces and put them back in the turned off but still warm oven for 5 more minutes, and I got golden brown, crispy crackers. The crackers were not quite as nutty as store bought (I guess that's why other recipes use whole wheat flour) but they were a good enough approximation. Next time, I'll use a bit less sugar, although this is a matter of personal taste. Thanks, Steph, for the recipe.

These were really good, but I changed it up a bit. Instead of the water, I used milk. I also added a little extra cinnamon, half a teaspoon of salt, and a teaspoon of honey. The batter was quite sticky, but don't let this discourage you! Just keep flouring the surface and the rolling pin.  I did have a problem with the crackers only getting brown at the corners when they were in the oven, so I took those out and put the rest back in. It may just be my oven. Also, I recommend you poke holes in them with a fork before you cook them so they don't get any bubbles.  I also topped them with cinnamon sugar... I made a mix in a bowl and used 3 tablespoons sugar and 1 teaspoon cinnamon.  They turned out not too sweet and not too bland, in other words "lagom" for all you Swedes. At least that is how I felt.  Be sure you don't leave them in the oven too long. If they start turning a darkish brown (before a dark dark brown) then they will taste a bit burnt. You want them to get golden! I'm thinking about trying them with cocoa powder next time. =)

I can't rate this actually 'cause I haven't tried them yet (I don't know how to give a tip on here), but I do know that you can buy graham flour in the store or online.  The brand is Hodgson Mill in a brown bag.  This might be the difference in it tasting like graham crackers you get in the store.

These were good, but not quite as good as store bought.  A little hard to cut in to shapes because the batter was so sticky.

I give it two stars because they taste good, but I want to give it one star since the recipe is not what I woudl expect from a graham cracker recipe.

I was looking for a cracker recipe that was chewy enough for my 1 year old. These are perfect. I will probably play around with flavor a bit the next time I make them, but they are still good as is.

Very easy recipe and tastes good too! Not exactly like store bought, but good to have on hand and brag about. I did double the cinnamon.

This is a good recipe but I added part whole wheat flour and wheat germ for texture and they were delicious.  I had to cook them on parchment because they were crumbly, but it was worth it.

I am making a cheesecake recipe from a magazine and the crust is with amaretti cookies and graham crackers (I bought graham flour especially for making the graham crust but I see no one using it). Has anyone tried making graham crackers with the flour mentioned above? Can anyone suggest whether the whole wheat may be substituted for the graham flour? I will post my results (even if no one has had enough time until Easter to answer my question) when I will make the cake.

It stuck to my table and I couldnâ€™t roll it out. I winded up making them into cookies, which ended up pretty good.

I liked them very much. Much like everyone I did change some things up. I added honey, vanilla and some milk. I made the batter in super thin layers and they tasted like graham crackers to me with or without the wheat flour or graham flour. Thank you for your recipe!

I did make them using only the Graham flour and I loved them!   However my husband was not a fan of the "mealy" texture.  I always make a whole wheat crust for my pumpkin pie (my sister in laws favorite appetizer before the Thanksgiving feast,lol) And it tastes very similar to that.   Next time just for hubby, I will try using 1/2 graham & 1/2 white four.
