I found this recipe tasted better after it had a chance to marinate a few hours.  I also added about 1/2 teaspoon of garlic salt and used the Zesty Italian dry dressing mix.  It was a hit with our guests!

Try not changing anything else, but making one addition...a standard size package of cream cheese :)  Makes it really good.

Out of five appetizers - no one ate this. The shrimp and the italian flavor with potato chips just didnt work together. The most of it went in the garbage.

I agree that this recipe is easy and perfect to take to parties.  I made it to take to a Christmas Eve cocktail party and it was gone in no time at all.  I do have to confess that I did something I never do, I changed the recipe.  I used a pound of shrimp not the ½ pound the recipe called for.  Come on, who doesn’t love shrimp!  Also, I don’t eat potato chips but served this with whole wheat grain crackers.  Great recipe and I know for a fact I will be making this many times again in the future, thanks for sharing it with us!

This is just ok.  Even though it's italian dressing mix it really tastes like ranch.  A basic ranch dip with shrimp mixed it.  If I am going to go through the trouble of using shrimp for something I'd like it to have a little more punch.

I make this but with the addition of cream cheese, 1 cup of sour cream, dry Italian seasoning & cooked shrimp & garlic salt.  It's better the next day.
