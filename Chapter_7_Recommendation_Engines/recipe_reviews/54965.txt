I spent 20 min. online searching for a curry recipe similar to how my Dad makes curry - this was it! I love a saucy curry, no coconut milk, more in the mideast tradition.  I used this recipe as a base & doubled the chicken broth, added garlic, 1/2 cup raw carrots, 1 cup fresh broccoli & tripeled the raisens, and then I let it simmer for about 40 minutes. Also, I did not use apple & used olive oil not butter.  It was great!

This is not a curry like the traditional Indian curries I usually make, but it is very good!  I used 4 chicken drumsticks and added a little extra curry powder, and some coriander and nutmeg.  I used regular raisins, not golden.  Served it over rice, topped with chopped peanuts, which added a nice flavor and a little crunch.  Overall, this is delicious!  I will make this again...

This is so good!  Both my husband and I loved it.  I used sweet onion which added to the curry/sweet contrast, and took another reviewer's advice of adding more curry.  I also used plain old purple grapes because they were on hand and I can't imagine what the difference would be.  We had trouble finding out what wine to serve with this, but eventually settled on a light chardonnay from Australia, with little acidic bite so it wouldn't complicate the spicy curry.  I could eat this every day.

I added my own touches to this recipe and it came out great! To boost the flavour I added 1 cup of chopped carrots, 1 tablespoon of nutmeg, 1 cup of regular raisins, 1 garlic clove, 2 TABLESPOONS of curry powder and lemon juice when I serve it. My husband and his friends loved it! It tastes just as great as left-overs also. I like to serve it with jasmine rice.

Leftovers are great when cut into pieces and used for curry chicken salad..just add mayo and be sure to include the apples, raisins, onions and all. Very, very good.
