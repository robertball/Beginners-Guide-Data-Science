I'm rating this recipe as 5 stars based on the following modifications: sautee chopped onions and mushrooms (added by me), and seasoned chicken (greek seasoning, salt, pepper) in olive oil and white wine, then add soup, worcestercshire, about 1/4 cup mayo, nutmeg, and some garlic powder (no cream!). Mix in the blanched asparagus, then mix in parmesan cheese.  Pour the whole thing into a casserole dish, top with a sprinkling of cheese and bake at 375 for about 25 minutes.  Serve over rice - it was sooo tasty and my whole family devoured it.

This recipe is wonderful.  I followed the directions, except for a couple of changes.  I omitted the nutmeg, as my family doesn't care for the taste, and I mixed the cream and mayonise with the soup mixture; added salt and pepper.  Absolutely delicious served over rice, there were no left-overs.  Thanks

This dish is very rich and flavorful. It's simple to put together and I suggest staying with the recipe without  adding too many variations. The simplicity of it is what makes it great. A few things I would suggest are cutting the asparagus into 2" pieces after blanching them in the water. It will make serving it a lot easier. I didn't cut them down and created quite a mess trying to plate it. Another suggestion is to cut the chicken in thin slices before cooking it. I did this and then just stir fried the chicken in a little oil before adding it to the casserole dish for the oven. This allows you to cook the meat evenly and also control the texture of it. I prefer this method rather than taking a change on overly rare or well done conditions that can happen with oven baking breasts of different sizes and cooking requirements. It also prevents you from having to slice the chicken while it's still hot. This is a great recipe and a big thanks to "Jeanne Koelsch" for submitting it. The kids loved it!

I made this recipe because my 21 year old daughter loves asparagus and I rarely cook with it.  The entire group (5 of us) loved it and wants me to make it again.  I used half and half instead of whipping the cream and it turned out lovely.

This wasn't bad. We try to keep our recipes on the healthy side tho' and this is not low-fat, cal, etc. I was stepping out of the box and hoping for something so good that we could splurge with once and a while but this one won't make the cut.

I made this last night and it was really delicious. I'm a huge garlic fan so this was a great change of flavor for us, although next time I may decrease the amount of nutmeg just a bit and add more chicken. My BF had three helpings! Thanks for sharing

As recipe calls for this is very bland but has a good start to something incredible.   I souped it up a bit with sauted with olive oil and butter....garlic, onlion, fresh parsley, oregeno.  Added flour and 2% milk into the existing oil/butter and made my sauce from there.  Blended that with the soup mix and set aside.  From other reviews I decided to slice my chicken in thin slices and saute for about 6 minutes.  Pour the chicken over the chopped asparagus (in a 9x13 baking dish) and went from there.  Baked covered at 350 for 20 minutes and the final few minutes uncovered and broiled to brown.  

Wasn't bad but everyone still complained it was too bland.  I'm saving this recipe because it's a good start but next time I'll be adding more garlic and herbs to punch it up.  Don't hesitate to play with this one!  I know I will.

This was absolutely delicious. the only thing i added while preparing this meal was garlic powder (garlic freak here)  and salt and pepper. While making this dish, i really did not expect it to taste as good as it was. I cant wait to make it dinner guests next week!!!!

This truly amazed me since it seemed an odd combination of ingredients, but my goodness it was so heavenly!! We are huge asparagus eaters here and it is just the perfect veggie for this combination of flavors. I wouldn't dare change a thing as it is perfect as is...and a really great company dinner to boot as it is delicious and not too time consuming and can easily be adjusted to fit any size dinner party. Thank you so much for posting!! Oh yeah,  it also got rave reviews from all 5 of my kids aged from 6 to 21 and also loved by my hubby!!

I found this easy to put together and absolutely loved the flavor.  I plan an working with the seasoning a little just to see what I can come up with, but I do already love it as it is.

This recipe is a definite keeper. I used fresh asparagus and a little less mayo for my tastes. This was a big hit with my teenage daughter!

Everyone who ate this loved it!  I've made it twice.  The first time we substituted fat-free half and half for the whipping cream, no nutmeg, and shredded parmesan rather than grated.  The second time we used regular half and half, and about half the amount of nutmeg the recipe calls for.  Both times we served it over rice, which tasted great!  I'll definitely make it again.

We enjoyed it, but would do a couple of things differently next time.  I wouldn't cook the asparagus ahead of time (it got mushy on us).  I would also cut the chicken a little thicker, so it stays moist.  I like the idea another reviewer had of adding stuffing- will try next time!

Excellent recipe!  My husband raved over it and all four kids devored it, asparagus and all!  The only real change I made was to use ramano cheese instead of parmesan but only because that was what I had on hand.  Will definitely use this recipe again and again.

I had pencil thin asparagus so I did not blanch it before cooking in the oven.  I did not care for this recipe nor did my children, but my dh loved it.  I found it hard to serve, the soup and topping became quite runny.  Overall the flavors were good but I will make several changes in the future.  I will cut the asparagus into bite size pieces and add some spices to the chicken before roasting it.  Will try this again in the future.

Recipe was ok.  Sauce was a little much.  I would use less mayo next time.  Wasnt worth making again.

Incredible! I did it a little different, cooking the chicken in olive oil and then mixing in all sauce ingredients and asparagus. Then put the whole thing in a dish and baked at 375 for 20 minutes. Served over penne and it was FANTASTIC!

YUM! I followed the recipe except that I grilled the chicken in 1" pieces in a grill pan with a little salt, pepper, onion powder and garlic powder for extra flavor. It was great. I'll definitely make this again!

I'm rating this recipe pretty high 5.  I modified it a bit.  Added hot sauce instead of worcestershire sauce.  Left out the nutmeg, and sprinkled the chicken layer with balsamic vinegar.  I also used fat free mayo, skim milk and served it over brown rice.  Yummo!

OMG sooo good!!!  I took the easy route though, and had to change some ingredients due to what i had on hand.  First of all, it's easiest to cut the asparagus into bite sized pieces.  Then, I used ground beef instead of chicken, cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken, and omitted the nutmeg. Also only used a little spoonful of mayo & used a splash of milk instead of cream.  I mixed it all up in a pan on the stove and served it from there with rice.  My 2 year old DEVOURED it - asparagus and all!!! :)

I'm giving this 4 stars because I thought it was really good!  DH didn't care for it though  I am not too sure about the nutmeg, I will probably only put a tiny bit in next time, it's kind of a weird flavor in a casserole.  I also seasoned the chicken before broiling and put s&p on the asparagus after placing it in the baking dish.  So with a little tweaking this is a great recipe!

Just made this and it turned out yummy!!  I was a little skeptical of the mayo/whipped cream combo, but even that turned out alright.  The nutmeg really makes this dish special and flavorful.

This recipe is very good.  I used 2 lbs chicken and 1 lb of asparagus- hubby is a meat lover.  I also added 1 cup of pepperidge farm herb stuffing to the parmesean topping. Next time I would maybe add some ham and use cheddar instead of parmesean- then maybe the kiddos would actually eat it. (My kids are very picky.)

This was an excellent recipe.  I had to make a few adjustments based upon what I had on hand, but Yummy!!  Used chicken bone in breast and added favorite spices.  Then I cooked in the oven for 45 minutes.  When the chicken was complete, I removed it from the pan, drained most of the juices and mixed the remainder with the soup mix.  I returned the chicken to the pan, added 2 cans of asparagus and pour soup mix on top.  I forgot the cheese...but let it cook for 20 minutes.  I then added the mayo/cheese mixture and popped it in the broiler.  Served with rice.  Yummy, yummy...and it looks beautiful.

Delicious. I left out the nutmeg because my family doesn't care for the flavor, and served it with caesar salad. It tastes exactly like the same thing in a restaurant. Thanks for the recipe!
