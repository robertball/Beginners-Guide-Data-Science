Sliced the sausage instead of diced but that is the only change I made. This is good but it needs more cajun seasoning in my opinion. Easy fix. I also thought it would have benefited from a thicker more firm pasta. Regular spaghetti over the angel hair maybe?

Made this for my family as I had some andouille sausage to use. It was so good! I used chicken instead of shrimp because my toddler has an allergy with shrimp and doubled the Cajun seasoning. Topped off spaghetti noodles with it and we all loved it. Definitely recommend ?? Great recipe!

Very good, but will make a change per our liking. I will saute the andouille sausage by itself 1st before adding onion, celery & pepper. I'll also use the dutch oven because once everything is in the pan it is hard to stir together if you don't in a dutch oven. Will make again.

Set it for 15 and fed a dozen with kids mixed in. Easy because I watched but it went together. We did all fresh vegs and cooked them a bit longer and also the appreciated authentic Cajun sausage. 5 minutes at the end for shrimp and some crab we threw in.
