My roommate and I LOVED this recipe. We didn't have butter, sprinkles, or white bread, so we subbed pita for the white bread, feta cheese for the butter, and chopped lamb for the sprinkles. It was so easy to make and my kids were also able to help, which I really appreciated. All in all it made for a great dinner, and I would definitely serve it to any guests. Thanks for a great, easy-to-follow recipe!

4 stars for cuteness and probably about 3 for taste - this is definitely a kid friendly recipe. With that in mind I cut the bread into cute shapes using cookie cutters I had laying around. I dusted these with a bit of sugar as well as brightly colored sprinkles. My niece thought these were great especially when paired with an ice cold glass of Sunny D!

My son won't eat this as is.  But, when I toasted the bread and used peanut butter instead of butter, we had a winner!

I LOVED the idea of this as we were about to have 6 little kids for a week-end breakfast. We toasted Texas bread, cut it into big circles, squares and triangles. We spread with a variety of things, all spread thin; peanut butter, honey, butter and greap jelly. Then we used a scattering of mult-collored sprinkles and finished with a light dusting of clear sugar crystals. It made them sparkle and the kids gobbled them up. I was even able to coax most to eat some scrambled eggs and fruit, just to get more "glitter-bread". Will for sure use this idea when the G.kids visit!

I saw this recommended the other day on the exchange and I went to go make it for my sprinkle-loving toddler and she wouldn't eat it!  I was so disappointed!  She picked off a few of the sprinkles then gave up.  It's a good idea though, just not for us.  I never thought to put sprinkles on anything but cakes and stuff so now I may have to try putting sprinkles on things she won't eat like peas...

This was a great breakfast treat for my son and his cousins. We used reduced fat spread and various leftover decorating sprinkles. Next time I might even let them use cookie cutters to cut the bread into fun shapes.

"Yummy yummy yum!" is my four-year-old daughter's review of this. :) I toasted two slices of bread, spread them with Country Crock, and then she started to sprinkle. We noticed the sprinkles (Easter-themed ducks and bunnies and some purple and pink sugars) didn't want to stick to the toast, so we tapped them off and spread a thin little layer of grape jelly on the toast. She then resprinkled to her heart's desire! A fun little breakfast for a rainy day, thanks so much for sharing, Mermaid In Oz. :)

This was simple and fun. I used unsalted butter. It was just boring so I added a sprinkle of white sugar and it helped with the taste. The candy sprinkles are mostly waxy and needed the dusting of sugar. Thanks, this was a cute snack.. Not for the discerning palate but I'd eat it again, as I like bread and butter.

Can't go wrong with Fairy Bread! I also use Nutella or Cream Cheese instead of Margarine. If I have been backing and I have some leftover Buttercream Icing, I add a few tablespoons of Peanut Butter and use that! The Kids (young and old) love it!

Tip:  Must use very fresh soft white bread. Real butter tastes better than margarine.

I'm gonna be honest here I didn't try these (made em for the kids) something about bread smothered in margarine and covered in sugar sprinkles just doesn't scream good eats to me lol.  My kids and boyfriend LOVED it! I did toast my bread and we used clear shimmer sugar, multi color sprinkles, and chocolate sprinkles. Super cute idea and it was a middle of the movie,  movie night snack that didn't cause me to miss half the flick like the usual  snack does. I'm not sure a kid or manchild alive wouldn't love this for a quick simple snack!

This truly is an Aussie kids party must have. As an Aussie, living in Australia I can honestly say I've not been to a kids party that hasn't had Fairy Bread.
The recipe works just as well with Butter (I prefer the taste of butter) but Fairy Bread really needs to be eaten within a few hours of making. Otherwise the colours in the sprinkles will run and the sprinkles themselves become a bit soft and unappealing.

My son's second grade class was studying Australia. We made this fairy bread to share with his class (complete with new vocabulary--100s and 1000s). It was a tremendous hit, and so simple to make with kids!

Fairy bread always brings fond memories of "home."  Always served at my childrens'b/day parties, and our American guests just loved this Aussie treat.   Now adults, my son and daughter still ask for fairy bread.

As a kid I made these using sugar instead of sprinkles. I just called it sugar bread. When I heard the phrase "fairy bread" and how good it was, I just had to find out what it was and try it. Only to learn I'd been eating an edited version since I was small.  Now, using gluten free bread coconut oil, I can try this childhood dessert in a new way.  I was not disappointed.

A kid favorite
We didn’t have white bread butter or sprinkles 
So we substituted pizza dough, marinara sauce  some basil and mozzarella cheese and then baked it in the oven for about a half hour. Was great !

This was definitely cute, but I thought the butter could use a little sugar. I thought the "100's & 1000's" sprinkles were too crunchy. When I was in Holland, they used chocolate sprinkles that were really good. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

It's a fun treat for the grandchildren. We made hearts since it's February, the month of love.

we do the same thing, toasted or not but we use the chocolate sprinkles and to us its called moushes dutch for mouse tirds. The kids find it amusing to think they're eating something they can refer to as mouse tirds!

This is such a cute recipe! I did half with non-pariels and the other half with sprinkles. My little guy loved it, so that's good enough for me! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is a great recipe for young kids to help with!

I cut whole wheat bread into stars, spread with tub margarine, and sprinkled with colored "shots".  

My 1yr old licked the candy off, my 3yr old ate his stars in record time, and I took a few bites, but wasn't all that impressed.  Next time I'll try toasting the bread.

I thought that I would not like this, and that my toddler would love it. Actually,  it turned out quite the opposite. My son just stared at it!!! I wound up eating it, and making him cheese toast. LOL, I'm going to try this again in few months. Thanks.
