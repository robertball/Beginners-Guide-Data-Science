We had a huge turkey dinner on Saturday and had plenty of left-over turkey.  So, I searched this site and found this recipe.  Yummy!  It then ended up I babysat our Mexican friend's 3 children.  So the 8 year old wanted to help me cook dinner.  This recipe does take some work so it was nice to have the extra hands for stirring, etc.  She also taught me how to roll a "mean" enchilada in no time!!  I didn't have yellow or orange peppers but it was still awesome.  We will eat these again.  We topped them with more sour cream and salsa.  I did not heat the tortillas in oil, we just popped them in the microwave for a minute to save time.  All I can say is everyone loved these - delicious!

i love it. only suggestion is to skip the frying of the tortillas. its fine to microwave them with a damp hand towel on top. takes about 3 minutes for 24 tortillas. the first few on the top may not be great but the ones underneath are pliable.

Don't let tje LARGE number of ingredients intimidate you. It's not difficult at all. This is a great dish for left over turkey. Everyone loved it. Of course it is not low calorie in anyway, but it's a nice dish for a special occassion. I have also made this with chicken breast. I did not fry the shells either.  I didn't have the 2 types of chilli pepper. I just used traditional. I didn't use the 3 coloered peppers either.

This recipe is excellent. I made a few changes however to suit my tastes. Instead of the ground chipotle and ancho chilli powder I used 2 tbsp of pureed chipotle chilli's in adobo sauce. Instead of paprika I used 1 1/2 tsp chilli powder. I put two cups of the cheese in with the turkey meat mixture, but the last half cup for over top. Also when you fry the corn tortillas, use one or two tbsp of oil at a time. You don't need a lot of oil to soften corn tortillas.

Seasonings and creaminess perfectly complement the turkey flavor.  I didn't have chipotle or ancho powders so I subbed a chopped chipotle in adobo and there was appropriate heat and flavor, I think.  Will make again with chicken leftovers too.

This was very tasty and very rich! Love the cumin flavor, and just the right amount of heat from the chipotle/ancho spice.  Thanks for the recipe!

Unbelievably good.  I omitted the cumin and doubled up on the onions, Chipolte and ancho chile peppers.  By far the very best Enchilada I have ever eaten.  Highly recommended.

Very Good! I Left out the Chile peppers and exchanged it for a jalapeno pepper (seeded).

Very good, I had some left over filling so I mixed cooked rice, chicken broth, and filling. Topped with cheese made a delicious creamy Mexican soup.

Very Rich and Creamy!!  I still wanted it hearty but did not care for all the different types of peppers,  So I kept the Green Peppers and the onion, and added diced tomatoes and black bean, a little fiber doesn't hurt!!  Yummy

Didn't use ancho chile powder, just regular but still tasty. Froze these and thawed for later and they had great flavor.

This was a great way to use up leftover turkey!  We all liked the smokey taste.  I ended up using some jalapeno jack along with the cheddar.  The only thing I would do different next time is add some verde salsa to the meat mixture and on the bottom of the pan to even out the flavors a little.

It did not work at all: the meal was sloppy, gluey, tasteless and unappetising in appearance.

We really liked the filling on these enchiladas!  I did think it could have used a little more spiciness to it, but hubby was just fine with that.  I used flour tortillas because that's what I had on hand, and I didn't have a green pepper.  I did have some diced green chilis handy, so I added that to the filling.  I wanted a little more "stuff" on the top of these.  I don't think the use of all three -- the cream cheese, sour cream, and heavy cream -- was totally necessary, so if you were short of one you could make it up with the other two.  All in all, served with a little salsa on the side, these made a very satisfying meal!  Thank you for the recipe!
