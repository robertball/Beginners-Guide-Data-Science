This sounds great but can someone tell me whether "powdered chocolate drink mix" means hot chocolate mix or something else?  Thanks!

Tastes good and makes a nice gift in a jar. Put the whole mixture through the food processor to further mix it and to make the mix smooth and even. It makes a lot, so you'll have some for yourself, too!

You will need a huge bowl to mix this.  I followed the suggestions of the other reviewers and put it in the food processor.  By doing this I was able to use a gallon size zip-lock for storage.  It is a nice smooth and tasty drink. I will enjoy giving this as a token gift to many.

I don't like coffee but I wanted to make this as Christmas gifts. My husband loves coffee but not mocha so much so he became my guinea pig. Bless his heart, he tried 4 of these coffee/drink mixes from All Recipes. This was his favorite by far! I would trust his word on this one:-)

I have made this for several years to give as teacher gifts at Christmas time.  It is always a big hit!  If you mix it all in a blender, the volume will decrease and you will need to use less in each cup.

This is good, a mild chocolate flavor and not overly sweet. It does taste a little weak coffee wise, but I suppose that is simply a matter of personal preference. I do think it would make a terrific gift, however I'm hoarding this first batch for myself. ;) Additional Note: If you halve this recipe, it takes exactly 1, 10.9 oz. container of Nestle Quik - and you STILL need a big bowl to mix it. I also used the French Vanilla flavored powdered creamer and I think that worked nicely.

Very good!  Just the right balance of coffee/chocolate/sweetness for my taste. I used the store brand of chocolate drink mix (matter of fact, all ingredients I used were store brand!) & it tasted great and saved money too, or you could use Nestle Quik. This will make a nice gift.

Looking for a mix that my teenage daughter could give to friends as a gift for Christmas.  This was Perfect!!  It has a mild chocolate flavor with a hint of coffee.  Very smooth for the young.  I would prefer a little more coffee but she loved it as is.

This is delicious and took the advice of reviewers and blended it all in the food processor to make it powdery and smooth.  I also added cinnamon and nutmeg to spice it up and it was great!

I love making this during the holidays! I make a bunch and give out to friends as gifts. Make sure to use chocolate drink mix - NOT cocoa mix. The cocoa mix recipe will make this too milky/creamy and not enough mocha/chocolate flavored. I think the recipe is just right as is. However, if you like your coffee strong, you can add a Tbsp or two to every 1/4 cup of instant coffee called for in the recipe.

Fantastic. To answer the "chocolate drink mix" questions, think Nestle Quik.  Not hot chocolate powder.

My daughter and I made this and loved it.  We left out the coffee granules and use it as a mocha creamer for our brewed coffee.  This recipe made so much, we were able to split it and each have tons!

This recipe is so forgiving. You can customize it to your own taste. It tasted too sweet for me, so I upped the coffee granules (to 3/4 c.) and added about 1/8 c. cinnamon. Just right for me! I plan to package some as gifts for Valentines Day.

This is a perfect blend!  I had to get out the stock pot because I didn't have a bowl big enough to stir without making a mess.  These will make great Holiday Gifts!  Thank you for sharing!

I added 2 rounded cups of instant coffee instead of 1 1/4, which gives it more of a coffee flavor. This is a holiday favorite. I give it to my nieces and nephews who are in college and they love it. I found really cute little jars at Ikea. I put the mixture in the jar, and top it off with mini marshmallows. They love it!

i have to give this a 3.5 stars because it seemed too bland-my husband said it tasted more like hot chocolate- so I had to add additional coffee and sugar. took the suggestion to add cinnamon which added to the fragrance.  An economical gift with supplies from Costco and jars from Ikea.

I just have to tell you that I LOVE this recipe!! I made it last night for presents for people and of course I had to try some of it before I packaged it up for all to have and I was in heaven! It is a light flavor, not overwhelming and not too heavy on the coffee. I think this is something that all will love. My sister doesn't usually like mocha and she was head over heals for this. I was very happy that it turned out so well because the recipes yeild more than I kinda thought it would have, which is a good thing. Thanks for the recipe Bea!

I increased the coffee to 1 1/2 cups because I liked the flavor better.  I made this for Christmas gifts for friends in pretty jars.  It was a big hit!  Thanks for the recipe.

LOVED this recipe!  I was reluctant, but thought it would be nice for teacher gifts.  I only had 1/2 the ingredients which only yielded 3 to 4 gift mugs.  I bought cute holiday cellophane bags to put the mix in.  I used vanilla flavored creamer as suggested and added a tsp of cinnamon which was delicious in my sample mug!

I added some caramel into my cup and put some whipped topping on top with a little more caramel for decoration and it tasted almost like a famous companies caramel mocha.

I used this recipe to make christmas gifts...put into personalized decorated gift jars. I did add just a bit more coffee for flavor, it was one of the better-tasting recipes for an "instant" mocha. You do need a really big bowl. Thanks!

I liked a little additional coffee.  After making the recipe as stated, I scaled it for about 16 and was able to use up most of the rest of the ingredients I bought.  yay!

I did scale this down to 1 serving (which might have something to do with it) as I'm tired of 'wasting' ingredients on recipes I'm trying out. This was very light and I really couldn't taste any chocolate. So I added about a teaspoon of cocoa powder to my cup. I think I should add another 1/2 teaspoon sugar though now. lol

Tasted quite good - might increase the coffe and the sugar, but otherwise, a very good flavor.  Even my kids liked it!

This is great. I was looking for some sugar free hot chocolate and this is great. I also use it in my coffee for some chocolate creamer. I changed the Splenda to 2 cups and the unsweetened cocoa powder to 1 1/4 cups. I love sweet and chocolatey. If I use it in my coffee I amy add a packet of Splenda.

I'm not sure what it is, but there's a flavor in there that I'm not fond of. Others have tried it and love it, though!
