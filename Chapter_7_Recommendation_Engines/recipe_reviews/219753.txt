Turkey Taco Soup Haiku: "Perfect as it is! I had to sub a few things. But wow, awesome soup!" My only changes were 1 lb. turkey, "Taco Seasoning I" instead of packet, a can of diced chili peppers (no fresh on hand), and less broth. Left my soup in the crock-pot for the afternoon and by dinnertime, it smelled sinfully-good. I love that it was so colorful, and almost wouldn't have minded even more veggies, but this soup was great, and the cook's notes at the bottom are very helpful too. (I also froze half for another night, but truthfully, I wouldn't mind having some leftovers in front of my face right now.)

1st time on website & made this soup.  My family loved it.  I switched the kidney beans for pinto beans (canned) - this is a recipe for your box.

This is great!  Something different!  The only problem we had was it is spicy.  I used Mild Taco Seasoning and it was still spicy, especially for the kids.  If I did it again, I would put a little bit of spices/taco seasoning in at a time.  Very easy dinner.

This is one of the best soups I have ever had!  YUM!  The thought of Taco Soup never appealed to me, and boy was I missing out!  

Thanks for sharing this fabulous recipe!

I made a few minor changes based on what I had on hand and personal preferences.  

* I used a can of drained corn instead of frozen corn.
* I used pinto beans instead of kidney beans.
* I used a small can of green chilies instead of a green chile pepper.
* I left the lime juice out.

Very tasty soup! I didn't have taco seasoning so I simply added more chilli powder, cumin. Some garlic powder, and a dash of clove and cinnamon--and I sauteed the garlic and spices with the turkey first. Luckily I had some chicken stock on hand from a left over roast chicken. Highly recommend---I will make it again.

So, this is hands down the best recipe I have found on Allrecipes.com and it is the only one that I have not made changes to the second time around.  I guess that is why I call it the best.

Not the best soup ever but good.  To be fair, I did not follow directions exactly.  I browned turkey (1LB) with onion and carrot, then spices, then the remaining using only 2 cups chicken broth (low sodium) as it would have been very runny using more.  I didn't have celery or corn and only used a small can of olives and black beans instead of kidney as that is what I had.  Very versatile!    I added up all nutrition info.  Made a total of 8 cups.  A 1 cup serving = 179 cal, 1.5 fat, 888 sodium, 23 carb, 5.5 fiber and 19 protein.  Overall healthy.... will use all low sodium next time.  Very filling too.

Great soup! I had to make a few subs due to what I had on hand but I followed the basic guidelines of the recipes and we loved it. I used Rotel for the tomatoes, no celery or olives, Penzey's Bold Taco seasoning, some frozen Hatch green chiles. It was definitely not too spicy even with the Rotel but the chiles we used weren't very hot. I'll be making this a lot this winter.

Great recipe!  We made the following changes in order to make it more kid friendly:  3 carrots & 3 stalks of celery instead of 2, 1/2 of an onion instead of a whole, 3 cloves of garlic instead of 5, 1/2 of a diced green bell pepper in place of the chile pepper, no chile powder, 1/2 packet of taco seasoning instead of a whole, 1 can of drained corn instead of the frozen corn.  Also, 1 lb of ground turkey is fine, since that is usually how it is pre-packaged.  It was fabulous and not spicy at all!  Also, the soup does not need any extra salt, just pepper for the adults.  Great with fresh cilantro and crumbly Mexican cheese on top!

Wonderful! Delicious!! I used my Thanksgiving turkey,cooked-down carcass and broth from it.  The few changes I made were mostly personal preferences.  I used pinto beans, because I think they're more taco-y than kidney. And hominy instead of corn, again--more taco-y.  I put in a chopped red bell pepper, and a chopped, seeded jalapeno. This would make a wonderful soup to serve a crowd! Yum, yum!!!!

Best Turkey soup my family ever tasted. Used Turkey carcass for a rich stock, leftover Turkey meat chopped, and doubled the veggies since I had 8 cups of stock. Added crushed tortilla chips to soup bowl,then ladled soup in, topped with grated cheddar, dollop of sour cream & a sprinkle if fresh chopped cilantro.

So good! It was a bit too spicy for the kids, but us adults loved it. Instead of kidney beans I used chick peas and black beans and I didn't have any chiles so I used the rotelle diced tomatoes with chiles in it. I also added green peppers too.

I’ve made this a few times, and it’s been a hit in the house every time. I love that it doesn’t call for a wimpy amount of garlic. Props to you, my fellow garlic hound recipe writer!

Loved it as written, but today I made it by breaking up about 10 corn tortillas, added 1/2 cup fresh cilantro and the onions to sauté together. Made it a bit thicker.

AMAZING!! Truly one of the best soups. I had ground turkey on hand and did a search. This delicious recipe popped up! I think it’s perfect as is, but is also one of those recipes that’s very flexible if you don’t have everything on hand. My husband and son went crazy over it. I sautéed the onion, garlic & seasonings and then added the ground turkey.  I subbed black beans for kidney beans, cut up Italian stewed tomatoes in place of tomatoes & celery. No carrots or olives.  Served with crushed tostitos and shredded nacho cheese. Three individual bowls left for tomorrow! Definitely a keeper! Thank you!

This was an awesome veggie, spicy taco soup!  I used leftover turkey from Thanksgiving and it was nice and chunky.  I used the hot taco seasoning, tomatoes with mild green chilies and a small can of hot hatch green chilies. I didn’t have cilantro but we didn’t miss it al all.

Like the other reviews suggested, i did use a small can of the green chile; great suggestion. Also I used about half the amount of taco seasoning and it was still full of flavor. I will definitely always use less.  I also made a little bit of wild rice separately and added a small scoop of it in my bowl to give it a little more depth to make it a little more filling. I didn't add it in the pot of soup because i didn't want the rice to soak up all the broth. In the future, i would consider adding it to the pot but will definitely remember to add more liquid, which would mean adding more of the taco seasoning, etc..

Made this with left over dark meat from our Thanksgiving turkey and worked great!  Doubled the recipe cuz this local bird had lots of dark meat.I shredded the meat well and added it after sautéing onions, celery and carrots.  Mixed the turkey well with the cooked onion mixture and then added garlic, spices, etc. in the order given.  Oh...added some smoked red jalapeño spice instead of the chili powder.  Turned out really yummy with loads of flavor!  Makes a lot so I will be sharing.  Love my mama but this is not her post Thanksgiving turkey soup!

Very good. Was looking for a recipe with ground turkey. Only thing I changed was omitted lime juice and added 2 cans of cannellini beans due to taste preference. Would definitely make again.

Excellent recipe.  I added zucchini to the soup and chips and cheese as toppings.   Everyone had seconds and asked for the recipe.  It freezes well also.

Low fat & very soothing.  I cook the turkey, seasonings, garlic, and onion on the stove then transfer everything to a crock pot for 6-8 hrs. Pro tweaks: omit the olives (salt control), use 4 limes for juice, double the healthy veggies (of your choice) and cover with water/broth. Makes sure you tie half the cilantro bunch with kitchen string before tossing it in the pot (it becomes very bitter upon re-heating) and throw out the bunch once you're done cooking - you can add chopped cilantro on each bowl. If you have kids, I omit the chili, jalapeño and the Taco Seasoning packet - you can search online how to make your own Taco seasoning packet to control the hot spices that go into it. Super good! Freezes well, and you can customize the toppings to personal taste (hot sauce, chopped green chili, chopped red onion, sour cream, chips).

Excellent recipe!  I plopped in 4 chicken thighs and simmered for 20 minutes until cooked through, then removed them, chopped up and put back in to the soup.  I did not add any extra salt, the seasoning was perfect.

I had to work with what I had on hand, so I used canned corn and left out the olives. I served it with a few corn chips and a dollop of sour cream. We loved it!

Love this!  One of our family favorites and wonderful all year round.  Great for a recovering new mommy meal train!  I make my own taco seasoning from one of the AllRecipes and follow the directions- have substituted beef but like the turkey better.

This soup was delicious and had well-balanced flavor and spice. I added in just over a cup of sliced sweet yellow, orange and red peppers and used pinto beans instead of kidney beans. I did not use the extra cup of water (it didn't need it.)

So flavourful!  After reading the other reviews, I added an extra 1/4 tsp each of cumin, chili powder and oregano although I don't think it needed it.  Other things I changed: 4 cups of chicken broth (that was the size I had, didn't want to refrigerate the rest), 2 cups of corn (it all tumbled out of the package and I didn't want to try putting it back in), I threw in a bunch of green onion (chopped) as well as the onion in the recipe, mainly because I had to use up the green onion.  I threw in the whole bunch of cilantro that I bought, at stage 2 (didn't separate and add later, no reason).  I bought pre-sliced olives in a jar and included the liquid from the jar in my 1/2 cup of olives.  Also, I didn't have green chilies so added 5 chopped jalapeño peppers (seeds in because I Iike it spicy) at the fourth step.  Oh, and I used pulled chicken breast instead of ground turkey.  Topped the soup with some shredded Monterey Jack cheese although again, it didn't need it.  I used Club House taco seasoning.  Lots of soup left over, out on the balcony freezing as I write.  Will definitely make this again!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is my boyfriends and my favorite soup and it's my go-to recipe whenever we have guests. We like putting in Greengiant's "mexicorn" instead of the  frozen corn as  the recipe suggests; it adds something that it somehow lacks with the frozen corn. 
Over all a great recipe!

If you want taco flavor...just make tacos. This soup disappoints. Lacks flavor. I used Mrs. Sages Taco packet so maybe that's where I went wrong. But, I followed the recipe to a "t". I'm a personal chef and I've been cooking most of my life...since a young child. I went over the recipe ingredients list a few times to make sure I didn't miss anything before posting this and sadly, I didn't. Without adding HEAPS of salt or more hot sauce, this soup just DISAPPOINTS.

Yummy.  I did modify slightly. I used tomato sauce in lieu of diced tomatoes because my kids are afraid of the tomato chunks but have no trouble with a tomato sauce.  Great recipe that I will use again.  Thanks for sharing.

I used diced black olives instead of sliced just to make the texture a little smoother to compliment the kidney beans, celery, and tomatoes. Next time I will definitely add some more chili powder for more spiciness but other than that it turned out great!!

Not only delicious, but healthy. My son and I had this for supper, and he gave it two thumbs up too. I love cilantro, but didn't have any on hand, but can easily imagine how the cilantro would make it even better. My son said that this could be served as a side at a nice restaurant, very nice compliment. It has an almost exotic quality, with a nice little bite. I didn't have the green chili pepper on hand, so one of the two (14.5 ounce) diced cans of tomato that I used was diced tomatoes with chili peppers. I'll come back to this one again and again.

has become my favorite soup!! okay I changed some things. I use either turkey or chicken, instead of onion I use onion flakes, I always leave out:
celery, cilantro, green chile pepper, and olives and sometimes the carrots. many reasons those left out, celery just doesn't go to me, never have cilantro, green chiles replaced with salsa, husband doesn't like olives and carrots sometimes I don't want. 
I use 2 tbs of garlic powder because I never have cloves of garlic. I use 2 cans of kidney beans, instead of one.
I put in 1/8 cup of taco seasoning the old el paso kind. 
And instead of diced tomatoes I use salsa, On the Border salsa to be exact, and the salsa is the difference people!! I have tried another salsa not as good as On the Border salsa!! you can get it at sam's club. trust me I love this soup will drink to the last drop!

Delicious! I did however have to adapt it for a family that includes a Vegetarian, and improvise based on what I had. I browned the ground Turkey separately. I sautéed the onion, garlic and 3 ea. of the celery and carrot in the Olive oil, and a chopped red bell pepper. I used 2 cans of chicken broth, 1 can of diced tomatoes, 1 med. can of tomato paste along with 2 cups of water.  I didn't have taco seasoning, so I improvised by doubling the listed spices. I let it simmer until carrots were tender. Served the turkey on the side as a garnish along with Cilantro and green onion. I will definitely be making this again!

Excellent! I didn't have celery or cilantro on hand, and used a canned chili instead of fresh. I also used taco seasoning I from this site instead of the package. I used two cans of chicken broth, and just a pound of ground turkey. I'd prefer less broth and more turkey (like the recipe calls for) for a thicker consistency, but it's harder to do with how things are generally packaged. Excellent, excellent! My 11 month old daughter even loved the black olives. :)

This is so good, with the perfect amount of spice.  I made this for some a friend whose husband just had heart surgery.  They loved how healthy it was and the how many yummy veggies were in it.  I used half low sodium chicken broth and half regular so it wouldn't be too salty.  It was perfect!
Thank you for the recipe!

Wonderful soup!  Have made this a few times and added a few things.  Added my favorite jar of salsa, a tablespoon of our favorite hot sauce, extra chili powder and cumin!  Perfect soup!

I really liked this hearty soup, but I skipped all the seasonings except the packet of Taco Seasoning.  My husband adds hot sauce to his own bowl of soup, and I prefer mine without many spices.  I did use cannellini white beans instead of kidney beans, just because that's what I had on hand.

So good, I didn't have broth, so I used 4 chicken boullions and 2 and one half cups of water,it was perfect. I left the beans out too. Now on I will only used ground turkey for taco soups.

I made this soup right to formula with the exeception of subbing 4 chicken breasts for the ground turkey, and it was fabulous. Next time i am pondering the juice of 2 limes instead of 3 which equalled 1/4 cup, also a diced avocado and some dried ancho peppers might be a good addition, but the soup was delish as per formula for anyone looking for that perfect recipe. :)

Super YUMMY and Super EASY!!!!  The only changes we made were skipping the chili pepper since my kids are picky about food being too spicy and we used a can of corn since it was on hand.  We ate this with tortilla chips... What more needs to be said when your kids "gobble" it up!!!!

I added a can of diced green chilies, rather than using a chile pepper.  And used Lemon juice in place of lime.  The soup had such great flavor, perfect comfort food for a crisp fall evening.  Thanks for sharing!

my first bowl was ok, but i decided the canned tomatoes were the spoiling the dish for me.  i removed all of them and loved the dish after that.  i will make again with/out canned tomatoes.

I deducted a star only because it calls for prepared taco mix instead of just including the spices in the mix..  Otherwise, we enjoyed this soup and will make it again.  Yeah, I'll tinker with the ingredients but, all in all, this soup is delicious as written.

I got the taco seasoning recipe from this same site, specifically here:

This is an excellent soup! My family can`t have dairy and it is such a relief to find such a good recipe!! I spiced mine up a bit and used spicy taco seasoning and traded up the olives for mushrooms :) I`ve never used cilantro before and I love it! Try this recipe for a great meal!!
