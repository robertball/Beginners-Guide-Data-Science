This was a great recipe.  I modified it by using left over pork and instead of peppers and mushrooms I used bean sprouts and green beans.  I would make this again using left over chicken or meat.  I sprinkled top with chow mein noodles.

I love chop suey and this recipe is as good as I have had from any chinese restaurant. I am making this for the third time today and can't wait until dinner time. I am going to modify the recipe today to use a can of straw mushrooms instead of fresh. Thank you Sandee.

I've been looking for a good pork chop suey recipe and have found it!  I followed with what some other reviewers did and used 2 cans of bean sprouts instead of bok choy...also I don't care for mushrooms and left them out.  All the veges came out tender crisp and the brown sauce had a wonderful flavor.  I added green onion on top along with chow mein noodles.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This recipe was great!  The sauce thickened just right.  I didn't use the sherry or water chestnuts (my sister doesn't like them) so it could have had a little more flavor with those.  I used cut up pork chops instead of tenderloin and it was fine.  This recipe went over great and I will be using it often.  Thanks Sandee!

This was delicious!  I didnt have Sherry so I asked some members of AR and substituted vinegar and red wine.  Turned out great.  I will make this again.  I served it with rice and chow mein noodles.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is an excellent recipe.  I have made this several times and my wife, who can be picky, always loves it.

The cooking goes quickly.  Be certain to leave lots of time for the chopping.

I used this recipe for its sauce -- I used what veggies I had on hand and left over cooked chicken breast. We both enjoyed it very much. (Don't understand why some other reviewers are leaving out the bok choy!) Next time I will make it with fresh minced ginger.

I thought this recipe lacked flavor.  It was very bland.  None of my family cared for it and we usually love stir-fry recipes.

This recipe was pretty tasty.  I used chicken instead of pork and green peppers instead of red as I didn't have any red peppers.  I also added about 1/4 cup chopped onions.  Very simple and quick to put together on a week night.

Good, quick, easy. I used boneless pork spare ribs and it worked fine. I also subbed fresh ginger and added a little sriracha for some heat. I would recommend doubling the sauce. There wasn't enough to pour over rice for us.

My family loved this.  I didn't have any bok choy so I added sliced bamboo shoots in place of it (what I had on hand).  Also had no sherry, so just omitted it.  This still turned out great! Will make again and again.

All of us really enjoyed this recipe and can't wait to make it again.  I loved it the way it was but it would be easy to alter with what you have on hand. I served with chinese noodles.

Tried this today using some pork chops we had on hand.  My wife and I really enjoyed it.  I just made sure to trim up the chops really well and remove all the fat.  Simple, but great tasting

I didn't have mushrooms, water chesnuts, and celery, so I used yellow and red bell pepper, green onions, edemame, bok choy, and sugar peas. For the sauce I used tamari, chicken broth, fresh ginger, orange juice and I am allergic to gluten and corn so I used my own gluten free flour to thicken it. And for meat I used shrimp, SO YUMMY!

Very delicious!  Some modifications: used chicken instead of pork but think it would be good with shrimp or just vegetarian.  Added a little more garlic and chicken broth.  Added 2 TBS of brown sugar.  No dry sherry.  Family didn't like the celery and red bell pepper so will omit next time.  Added a sweet onion, straw mushrooms, and mung bean sprouts.    Husband loved it.  I loved it too.

I didn't have all the veggies called for in this, so I just left out what I didn't have and added in one for a sub.  We bought some white asparagus recently that tastes more like water chestnuts than asparagus, so I used that instead, and weirdly enough, it worked incredibly well.  I left out the bok choy and celery and used orange bell peppers.  I also used less pork than called for and more veggies--healthier for us that way anyway!  This comes together pretty quickly (minus all the chopping--don't forget to build that into your cooking time!) and the sauce is pretty good.  I used red wine vinegar instead of sherry and we didn't notice at all.  I served this with a healthy portion of rice and some egg rolls.  Very good. Thanks for the recipe!

Any combo of veggies will work. I used carrots, celery, red bells, mushrooms, sugar snap peas, and bean sprouts. Sauce needs 2 scant tablespoons of sugar for sweet note.

This was so yummy and very quick to cook up!  I used Elk steak instead of pork and added smoked paprika to the flour.  I left out the mushrooms and added some summer squash.  I also added a tablespoon of hotsauce.  Next time I think I will put in some pineapple and sprinkle seasame seeds on top.  I served this over brown jasmine rice.  BIG HIT, even my 3 year old had seconds!

This is a great recipe.  I left out the bok choy, and added a can of bean sprouts.  I marinated the pork in some teryiki sauce for a while before cooking.  Comes together quickly and very tasty. Better than any chinese take out, that's for sure!  Enjoy!

Simple and tasty.  Was a great way to use left over pork roast. I'll make it again but with low sodium soy sauce and more bok choy and water chestnuts for extra crunchiness.

Best pork chop suey revipe ever! I had everything on hand to make this recipe except for the bok choy so I substituted cabbage. I also doubled the ingredients because I was cooking for a larger than expected number of people. There was nothing left over! The taste was perfect! Everything melded together in a delicious harmony. The texture was pleasing with just the right amount of crunch from the fresh veggies. This is a keeper! I know I will make this many times! It was so delicious and so easy to make that now ordering chop suey out from a restaurant seems a waste of time!

I have made this recipe before, I made it today AGAIN... and it is really good.  Cut the vegs before you put the pork on. It makes the cooking process a pleasant one !  Double the sauce. I used pinot noir because I did not have cooking sherry.

This was very good! I had to change things to suit what I had on hand. I left out the mushrooms and celery and used a frozen mix of peppers and onions.  I forgot to add the water chestnuts, ooops and used green cabbage. This still turned out very good, and suited my taste. I did not put the flour on the pork before cooking it in the oil.. used all soy sauce and no chicken broth. This was very fast to cook, and pretty cheap too. I added chopped carrots.

This recipe is terrific.  The only thing I missed were the bean sprouts that my mother always used in her recipe.  I'll use them next time and it'll be a 5 star for sure.  Great flavor, great textures...thanks!  In New England, where I grew up, we would get chop suey sandwiches at some of the beach stands.  You put the chop suey over an old fashioned (gummy-type) hamburger bun and it soaks up the juices.  Just an alternative to rice if you'd like to try it.  Thanks again!

I thought this was ok, but Husband didn't like the taste of the sherry in the sauce at all. I should have also reduced the amount of celery, as he isn't a huge fan. Thanks anyway.

I thought it was just "OK".  Not very flavourful.  Was my first time cooking with bok choy and I will definately include it in my stir frys in the future.

My family enjoyed it, but I felt it needed more zip, I did use low sodium soy and chicken broth, it may have taken away some flavor.

I marinated a pork loin in olive oil and Greek Seasoning for 4 hours and cooked it on a charcoal grill.  I also added 1 or 2 TBLSP of Oyster Sauce, one can of bean sprouts and one can or baby corn cob.  I added the pork after the vegs were cooked.  Family raved about the flavor.

Good but very salty. I think either using low sodium broth or soy sauce would help. Good to use as a base recipe and add whatever you have on hand.

Delicious!!!! Trying to cut back on sodium, so upped the chicken broth to 1/2 a cup and used 1/4 cup of low sodium soy sauce. No Sherry so just used rice wine vinegar as a substitute. Used a bag of bean sprouts and a bag of broccoli-slaw as the veg.  Amazing. This one is a keeper!

I dr'd this up a little. I doubled it. We like more gravy, so I used a 32oz size container of chicken broth. I let the celery cook a little longer then the rest of the veggies, so I added them first. Didn't have Bok Choy, so I used a half a bag of baby spinach.Also added a small sliced onion, and two chicken bouillon cubes. Added bean sprouts and baby corn to it also. Wonderful recipe.

I followed the recipe, sans the dry sherry because I didn't have any on hand. I found the flavor to be lacking something... But it DID taste better than most of the attempts I've made before I found this recipe. I *might* play around with this some more until I find what works for us... Overall, it's worth the effort, but I don't know how often I'm actually going to make it.

I believe in saying thank you when I find a recipe as good as this. Although, I will admit to tweaking it somewhat, it was top notch and very much enjoyed.  As I didn't have pork tenderloin, but did have boneless pork chops I cut them into bite sized pieces. I did not have the red bell pepper, nor the dry sherry, so I will have to remember to add both next time. I also added a third clove of garlic (personal preference) and bean sprouts. As my grandmother use to make chop suey when I I was growing up (and this was her secret ingredient), I added a 1 Tbs of molasses to the sauce. 
All in all a true success and a treat to watch the surprised looks on my family's faces. Will definitely by making again. Thank you for sharing this great dish!

My boyfriend and I thought this was awesome. I didn't think I liked chopped suey until I made this. So much better than I ever have had.  I added more veggies so I thought I should double the sauce. I'm glad I did.  We used a cast iron pan and I think it all cooked better because of that. Next time I will use fresh ginger. I made it again 9/19 and my husband didn't like it as much . He said it needed more flavor and we even served it with some sesame flavored Japanese noodles. Next time I will make sure to add enough flavor.

This was wonderful.  I substituted fresh bean sprouts for bok Choy because my store did not have.  Added dried hot pepper flakes to spice it up.  Used left over pork tenderloin..  Simply amazing.   The sauce is what made it delicious!  Will make again and again.

I found this recipe to have wonderful flavor.  I did, however, make a few changes, mostly regarding the veggies:  I've never had chop suey that did not include a can of bean sprouts, so I added those.  In an effort to increase the veggies, I also added thinly sliced carrots, diced onion, and some sugar snap peas.  None of these additions would effect the flavor very much, but they added a lot of vitamins and fiber.  I did add some freshly grated ginger (1 T) with the garlic, in addition to the ground ginger in the sauce.  I would have given the recipe the fifth star if I had been able to cook the pork for only three minutes as stated in the directions, but in order to brown the meat, it took at least 15 minutes.  Plan to cook the meat in two batches if your pan is not extra large.

I made this recipe except I used venison tenderloin (the back strap for all you hunters).  It was delicious and so tender.  My husband, the hunter, gave it his thumb's up approval.  I will make it again soon.

This was a very good recipe. I doubled the sauce. Didn't have sherry, used some red wine vinegar with about a Tbsp of honey and a tad bit of brown sugar, did not double the soy sauce. Used the chicken broth. I used water chestnuts, baby corn, bean sprouts, carrots, celery and a bit of onion, and sugar snap peas cooked in the bag in the microwave to make sure they were tender. Served over brown rice. Turned out great! Would make again for sure. Definitely have everything prepped before starting to brown the meat.

Had to substitute mashed potato flakes for corn starch. Thickened fine that way.

I made it exactly per the recipe, and it was fab. I thought the soya sauce would add enough salt, but it needed a bit more. I'll definitely make it again but will add a red or green chili for a bit of heat. I served it with jasmine rice, my family loved it.

Very good. Added bean sprouts and used shrimp instead of pork.

This is my go-to chop suey recipe.  You can use whatever veggies you have on hand, and I usually use leftover pork chops instead of fresh pork.  It is easy, economical and delicious

Quadrupled sauce & added sugar to balance salty/sweet. Very salty due to amount of soy sauce. May halve soy sauce with teriyaki sauce next time. All in all, very good!

Very easy to make! I used low-sodium broth and soy sauce. I used a can of fiesta corn to add a little flavor. Will definitely make again!

Excellent! Doubled the sauce amount and only just eyed up the veggie measurements but this turned out great tonight served over steamed fried noodles.  Adding to my regular rotation of stir fry's.  Thanks for posting!
