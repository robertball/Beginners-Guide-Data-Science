This is an excellent and simple clam chowder recipe!!  I have 4 boys and they LOVE it.  I always have to triple it so that I have enough for leftovers.
My only caution would be to watch your flame level because the milk very quickly scalds to the bottom of your pan.  I am not sure if it can be avoided, but it is a pain to clean up.

I have used the same ingredients for years with some additional ingredients.  I brown 4 oz side pork cut in very small pieces, add a little of the grease, cut 4-5 medium red potatoes, parboil and add, use 1 pint of half and half and additional milk to taste.

I read some of the reviews and added 1 cup half & half and 1 cup 2% milk. I didn't have white pepper so I added a bit of black pepper & this was excellent. I could not tell the difference from the time consuming from scratch clam chowder that I usually make. This is a gre8 recipe

This chowder was great, and my 5 year old son got to make dinner. It was a nice break for me, and it made him feel extremely important.

This was a very nice soup. It's hardly "from scratch", but it's quick and easy and made a nice thick, tasty chowder.  I made it exactly as written. (That "1 teaspoon butter" is an odd amount; I thought it was probably a typo for "1 tablespoon", but I followed it as is.) It made two big bowls for each of two dinners in a row. I would have liked even more clams though! Recommended.

Amazingly delicious! I halved all of the cream because as I was adding it, it seemed too heavy but I thought the amount I used was perfect. Plus I added a can of corn since I love corn in my chowder and it added a nice sweetness to it.
And I added about two or three tablespoons of scotch bonnett pepper to add a little kick since I like my soups to be a little more spicy.

Not home made, but great in a pinch! Fast and hearty, good for a quick weeknight meal. But don't expect it to take the place of your fresh from scratch Clam Chowder.

This recipe was excellent. It was so easy and tasted great. I will definitely make this again and again.
