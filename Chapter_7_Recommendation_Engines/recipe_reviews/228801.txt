I don't have almond milk--what I did was use 3/4 cup of lowfat milk (I wanted a thicker smoothie--1 1/2 cups of milk was a little too much for me) and added a touch of almond extract. I did use Trader Joe's Almond Butter and raw honey. Delicious smoothie! I just love the combination of peanut butter and honey.

This is so delectable.  I made one today just to try the recipe but I think I will have it for dessert next time.  It tastes like a high end milk shake.

This is our FAVORITE!! Frozen bananas almost are custard-like once in the food processor. When I'm craving ice cream or something sweet, this is my go-to!

I made it as written except reduced the cinnamon to 1 tbsp. It was really strong so I can't imagine what 2 tbsps would be like. The consistency is very thin so if you want a thicker smoothie you should reduce the almond milk or add some ice cubes or an additional frozen banana to the blender.

I just discovered this recipe; and Love it!!  I like my smoothies a little thicker so I only used 1 C of almond milk (used vanilla flavored) and added an individual size container of plain Greek yogurt...Delicious!

I tweaked it by using Almond Milk and 8 ice cubes instead of the almond butter mentioned here. It was delicious!

pretty good. It's higher calories than make it worth it for the flavor though
