Outstanding little cookie, great with coffee.  Just a note on saving money.  If you have an Asian market nearby, buy the sesame seeds there at 80% less than the normal grocery store.

Thank you, thank you to the person who posted this recipe!  When I was a little girl, my grandmother's neighbor made these same cookies.  They are wonderful, and the recipe is perfect...they are just as I remembered.  I highly recommend them!

Wow! My search has ended, too! I got some sesame seeds from our local bagel shop (he gave them to me already toasted) and they made all the difference in the world! Absolutely the hit of my Holiday cookie tray! Thanks!

These cookies were perfect!!! I made them exactly as written except I used half the butter. I agree with Marcelle2...this recipe only made 40 cookies. Also, you don't have to dip the dough in milk to get the sesame seeds to stick. I did it with and without. The only difference is that the dough gets more heavily coated when dipped in the milk first, but its so much more of a mess! The photo shown is without dipping them in milk. You can see they have plenty of sesame seeds on them. This is a great recipe that I will pass down to my daughters!

Diane, you've won my heart!! I've loved these cookies since I was little and was so thrilled to find this recipe to add to my Christmas cookie collection. They're amazing! The amount of anise extract is perfect. One reviewer said that her little logs got huge. Mine turned out fine but maybe it's because I make all of my doughs the day before so my cookies go into the oven a bit chilled from being refridgerated all night. I can't thank you enough Diane for submitting this wonderful recipe! Happy Holidays to all!

By far this is the best recipe for sesame cookies!  And I've been baking italian cookies for 60 years.  The dough is the perfect consistency for rolling in your hands.  You won't need the milk, just roll right into the seeds.  I used my favorite ''Fiori di Sicilia'' instead of anise extract.  It's an unbelieveable combo of citrisy & vanilla flavoring, like nothing you've tried before!  It can be purchased on line.  There should be a 10 star rating for this recipe!

I just made these cookies for the first time and they are an Italian favorite and delish.  I may have a suggestion to make prep time a little faster.  Instead of taking walnut size pieces of dough grab a handful of dough and roll it out on the counter until desired thickness.   You can then cut the strip into 2" pieces. This is the way I do Viennese Baton cookies and it goes very quickly.  Do be sure that your hands are not wet from the milk once you get going.  Thank you for this great recipe.

As the baker of the family, I was requested to bring Italian cookies to my Italian in-laws for Mother's Day.  Yikes!  However, I was told that these cookies tasted just like the ones from the Italian bakery.  Success!  My one recommendation would be to buy the sesame seeds in bulk so that they are cheaper.  I used almost two full spice bottles from the grocery, and that was not inexpensive!

The dough had a pronounced anise smell but when baked they lacked flavor.  The cookies were very easy to make.  I omitted the milk wash and had no problem with the seeds sticking.  A pretty cookie but needs more flavor.  Perhaps a little vanilla and more anise.

These are YUMMY!, I married into an Italian family who always made sesame cookies for Christmas.  My mother in law is 85 now and doesn't bake much anymore.  I made these cookies for the extended family last Christmas and they were a big hit. Better then the cookies my mother in law used to bake.  I love them and took to eating them for breakfast with a nice cup of coffee. :)

Great recipe, but here are my suggestions based upon my mother and aunt's recipe handed down by their mother and  grandmother (all from Sicily.)  Instead of anise, use vanilla.  Instead of all white sugar, use half white and half brown sugar.  Instead of dipping the rolled cookie in milk, dip in sugar water before rolling in the sesame seeds.  Oh, and they use crisco instead of butter.  One last note - before making these, rinse the sesame seeds, then spread on cookie sheet and lightly toast in oven.

This cookie is wonderful.  I rolled it in skinny logs, chilled it, sliced it, brushed with milk and sprinkled with seeds, then stacked 10 cookies and wrapped in plastic wrap, then tissue paper twisted shut at the ends.  Very festive on a tray for any party.  :). Today I'll make them as written just to stuff in my face!!!

Very nice cookie.  Almost like a biscuit -- not too sweet.  After reading other reviews, I added one teaspoon of vanilla extract.  I also bought the sesame seeds at an oriental market as suggested by another reviewer.  In the supermarket, they were over $4.00 for a small bottle & I was able to buy a full cup's worth for less than $2.00.  After baking the first batch, I very lightly toasted the sesame seeds to bring out more flavor.    I have added these cookies to my holiday cookie gift plates which is a nice addition & also a good contrast to some of the other sweet cookies.  Good to eat with a cup of tea!

sesame and anise go wonderful together.  I used slightly less anise, and the flavor was still plenty strong enough.  I would not bother with the milk unless you want a really thick layer of sesame seeds.  I rolled the dough right in the seeds and they stuck fine.  Bent the sticks into candy-canes for the holidays - kept there shape nicely.  Delicious!

This was a nice change to all the cookies out there. We made our cookies about the size of a thumb, they grow only a little in size, so you can crowd the cookie sheat. I will make these over and over again. They're nice with a hot cup of tea.

Addictive!! Note:  My butter was too soft which made the final dough too sticky to handle, but after a bit of time in the fridge, it was fine.  I've found that it works well doing a round shape too...easier to make uniform cookies

These cookies are SO EASY to make.  I found them to be a lot sweeter than the traditional Italian sesame cookie.  Next time I will cut the sugar in half.  Also, the cookies are much better the next day so if you're making them to bring somewhere keep that in mind.  Also, I used vanilla instead of anise and the flavor was fantastic.  Hint:  don't over pay for sesame seeds at the grocery store when you can get them for 1/4 the price at Penzeys spices.

I did one batch with the dip in milk step and one without. It is not needed - the sesame seeds stayed on just fine. They smelled wonderful, but did not taste as intense as they smelled. Next time I make this recipe, I will double the anise flavoring. A nice cookie to add to my recipe box!

very tasty cookie! I used almond and vanilla extract instead of anise and did not dip in milk.  Also only needed about half a cup of seasame seeds.  Very quick and easy.  Would be good with coffee/tea!

Very good, EASY cookie.  I like cookies that are "just a little bit sweet" and that's what these are.  Anise flavor is mild.  I skipped the milk step, but sesame seeds still seemed to stick pretty well.  I would make my logs a bit shorter next time...the first few I made were short and I liked the appearance better.  Plus, the very middle of the longer logs wasn't quite cooked enough after 20 minutes (not enough to make me not eat them though!).

I don't think sesame & anise go that well together, will try poppy seeds next time. My tastebuds may prefer a drop of sesame oil along with the sesame seeds & one of the following extract or flavouring....buttered rhum, brandy, butterscotch, caramel, coffee. Refrigerated dough is better as is now very popular with bakers & easier to handle. Ghislaine

Delicious cookies.  Everyone doesn't like anise flavoring, so I repeated the recipe with almond extract and they're just as good.  They don't last long here!  Will try lemon flavoring also.

This was very easy to prepare, refrigerate and then shape with my five-year old grandaughter who had fun rolling them in the seeds.  Everyone loved the anise flavor - just a light and delicious cookie.

I made this for the first time last year & I couldn't seem to make enough of them. They were met with rave reviews from all tasters. I now make double batches each time I bake. I need to make them all year round. They are truly a crowd pleaser. So easy & since they don't spread much, you can bake a lot at one time. Great time saver.

Wow.  Awesome cookie!  I toasted the seeds at 350 for 10 mins. Watch them closely to be sure they don't burn.  I added 2tbs of Ground anise seed.   You can buy ground anise seed and crushed anise seed online at Penzeys Spices. Thank you for posting this receipe!

I have been looking for a recipe like the ones from the Italian bakery.  These are close but something just missing.  I can't put my finger on it.  Probably won't make again.

Great recipe! wonderful texture and flavor, I didn't have anise extract so I added pure anise in the dough (about a tablespoon) and some drops of vanilla extract, the cookies didn't have a strong anise flavor but they came out great!

I really liked these, and gave them to several people who really like them too! Even people who claim to not like anise flavor! 
The only changes I will make in the future will be to use pre-toasted sesame seeds - they didn't get quite as toasty as I would have liked in the oven.
And to chill the dough before rolling it. I didn't at first, and the dough was sticking to my hands really badly. Next time I'll let it sit in the fridge for an hour or so.
The only change I made was to add a little lemon extract along with the anise. Delish! Thanks for the recipe!

I became a member of allrecipes just so that i could rate this wonderful recipe.  Everything about this recipe is just right, but for religious purposes, we do not consume anything with alcohol, so i eliminated the anise extract and opted to grind 1 Tbs of anise seed instead (perhaps a minute difference in flavor intensity, but I'll never know.)  Small imperfections in the shape bake right out as they rise a little, making it super easy to make a beautiful cookie!  I brought these to a party and was told that they look too good to be homemade...  I've made them twice this week and I have MULTIPLE requests to bake them for upcoming community events.  The flavor and texture are perfect for coffee/tea time.  Really, these cookies have improved my baking reputation.  I can't thank you enough for posting this.

Just tried this recipe today and here's what I did..
decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup, used 2 tsp almond extract, 1 tsp vanilla (I had made anise flavored pizzelle's earlier so did not want a duplication of flavor) refrigerated dough briefly. I did not need to use milk to make the sesame seeds stick.  Baked for 15 minutes until light brown on the bottom. They came out airy and nutty with plenty of flavor. Next time I will try it with the anise flavor which I am sure will be fantastic as well.  Thumbs up on this cookie!

These were a lot of work.  My "logs" kept getting bigger and bigger.  When I took them out of the oven they seemed grossly undercooked.  So I put them back in for what was apparantly too long.... although they didn't appear brown they were now as hard a logs.  Nobody really liked them.

Yummy!!  I'm very impressed by the way these turned for our cookie swap.  The only thing I messed up with is that I didn't have enough sesame seeds.  I bought a canister thinking it would be plenty, but the recipe calls for ONE CUP.  I ran out.  Oh well, still yummy!!

good, but not enough cookies for a large, Italian family's get-together. you've just got to have enough for everyone to take some home. otherwise, dough is silky, easy to handle, and very tasty.

Oh my God!!! These were delicious. Better than all the Italian Bakeries in New Jersey!! Loved the texture and the Amise aroma filled my house!! These will be great for the holidays coming up. For me the recipe made about 40 cookies not 60 as stated though.

I used raw seeds and since it was not specified I did not toast them first, when the cookies came out of the oven the seeds were very golden brown so I thought, "ok if I had toasted them first they would be over done."  I wish the recipe would specify if the seeds should be toasted first or not.  I also used vanilla extract instead.  I had to change my opinion about these cookies after a few days, I tasted these again and they are delicious, I stand corrected, this is a very good recipe for this type of cookie.

I had anise seed so I substituted 2 Tbl. of that and put in 1 tsp. vanilla extract.  Very nice subtle flavor and not too sweet.  The next time I will toast the sesame seeds first to bring out their flavor.

They are awesome I used anise seeds ( Like 2 tablespoons instead because where I live is a little hard to find the extract, dough consistency was perfect they continued crisp and perfect until they were all gone, Bravo for this recipe! I will make these again soon. If you have not tried it, start fixing it , you will not regret it!

Another 5 star review.  Really good, really easy to make.  I think butter should state room temperature otherwise how would you cream butter and sugar. Didn't do the milk/sesame step and seemed to have enough seeds.  Didn't have anise extract so used almond and 1tbs ground anise seed. I only made 20. Definitely be making again.

These were delicious! They remind me of the sesame cookies you get at fine Italian Bakeries here in New Jersey. I made the recipe as written. I didn't however, form them in sticks. I dropped them using my cookie scoop and formed them into squarish balls . My great-aunt was over when I made these and even ask for the recipe! This is a great recipe that will be used again and again!

Perfect recipe. I use less sugar to reduce the sweetness, and it turn out great! You can also mix the sesame seeds with the batter so that they won't come off easily.

Great flavor, but I think it's essential to toast the sesame seeds (on a cookie sheet for 10 min at 350 degrees) before rolling dough.  I ground 2 tbsp anise seed in place of the extract, and next time I will use at least 2.5 or 3 tbsp.

This is my favorite sesame cookie recipe.  I think the traditional Italian name is Giugiulena.  Great with or without the anise.

This recipe as submitted by the host is PERFECTION. Don't change one single thing. I LOVE to save time, so instead of individually cutting into walnut sized pieces, I divided the dough after I chilled it for an hour into four logs, rolled by hand on the countertop to about 12" long x 2" wide or so, rolled without the milk into toasted sesame seeds, cut into 12 pieces and was done in about 4 minutes.

I made several batches of these cookies for my church's Christmas fair. They sold out very quickly, prompting me to bake more that night for the fair's second day! Not too sweet, just right.

I've been looking for a good recipe for these, and this one hits the spot. I noticed a number of other reviews mentioning that the milk is not necessary for the seeds to stick. While this is true, I would still not recommend omitting it; in my last batch I tried A/B testing with and without, and the ones made without the milk  didn't form the classic cracked tops, and didn't have as pleasing of a texture. While it is a bit messy, it's not that bad, especially if you use a fork or slotted spoon for dipping the cookies in to the milk. I also found it most effective to first form balls, dredge those in the milk and seeds, and then roll those in to logs; doing it this way, you can get full even coverage just by tilting the bowl/plate to roll the wet balls around in seeds.

These cookies are fantastic!!  I made the recipe just as stated and would not change a thing.   Some previous reviews state there was not enough anise but I did not find this to be the case.   Just the perfect amount.  Will definitely make again.   Have included some photos of these great cookies.

Wonderful cookies. I made 2 batches with a few minor changes. I added pure vanilla instead of anise flavoring. I used a size 70 scoop and shaped into balls. I then rolled in the sesame seeds w/o the milk. Thanks for sharing.

Excellent recipe.  Much better than the recipe that I had from my mom's recipe since it didn't spread out when it cooked and better flavor.  I did increase the sugar to 1 cup and they still were not too sweet.  I also used almond extract instead of anise since I am not a big fan of anise.

I love this recipe!  The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because I altered it, so I can't judge the recipe exactly as given.
What I did ~ changed the sugar to 1/2 cup honey, changed the flour to a gluten-free blend, left out the milk.
Also, I found it easier to drop balls of dough in the sesame seeds, and then roll the dough into neat little logs.
These cookies were amazing.  Made them last night and they are already gone!  These are going on my permanent goodie list.:-)  Thanks!

A very tasty cookie that is really easy to bake.  My store didn't have anise extract, so I used anise seed (4 teaspoons).  I also skipped the milk as the dough was moist and sticky enough that the sesame seeds stuck to the cookies in a thick layer, no problem.  I will be making this recipe again, and will probably add another teaspoon of anise seeds.  
Yum!

Very, very good.  I didn't have anise extract so used almond.  Tasted great but anise would have given them a more authentic bakery taste.  Highly recommend.

Very good. 2 tsp seemed like a lot of anise extract so I used only 1 tsp. It was subtle. I'll try 1.5 tsp the next time and see. I used 5 oz of sesame seeds. Diane, thanks for the recipe.

Perfect for coffee, was a hit for the family. Was told that "these cookies are different" which tells me these are the kind of recipes I'm looking for.

loved these, Just like my grandma used to make. I ran out of sesame seeds so I used poppy seeds for the remailning which also tasted good but were black so not as pretty for Christmas. I think a cinnamon sugar would probably work also.

I followed the recipe exactly and they were just what I expected. Didn’t need the milk at all as the seeds stuck pretty well on their own. The only issue I had (if you consider it an issue) was that the dough didn’t spread at all. So the little logs I rolled stayed just that...logs. The pics from others seem to be somewhat flatter cookies. No big deal but they look more like mini breadsticks than like cookies!

I made these cookies twice. The first time, I followed the recipe to a tee and it wasn't bad but it lacked flavor. I didn't taste the anise. The second time I made it, I doubled the anise, added 1 tsp of vanilla and 1 tablespoon of lemon zest. It was amazing this way! I highly recommend making it this way.

Turned out well.Deciding the thickness of the roll and then cutting the dough to make a shape took time .They do not spread out as they bake,so they can be placed closely.Time for baking varies depending on color..they are tasty,not much of a sesame taste,but a good cookies and milk treat.

These are fabulous!!!  My only complaint is that I can't taste the anise extract---but I will just increase it in the next batch.   They are light, crunchy, and are fully flavored with the sesame seeds. Yum!!

This is a beautiful cookie!  I made it exactly as posted, and the anise flavor is very strong!  I love anise, so that's a great thing.  I didn't dunk them in the milk because I read the other reviews and it seemed like that would be a mess! For me, this made exactly 34 cookies.  I will make them again!

I made these for the first time last Christmas and now they are one of my Christmas cookie staples.  As another reviewer said, the anise flavor wasn't very strong so maybe I'll add a little more this year.  I also skipped the milk wash and the seeds stuck on just fine.  These are amazing cookies with a wonderfully crisp and almost airy texture.

Very east (for me) to make.  Reminds me of my grandmother's recipe, but much smaller scale.  I've made this recipe and shared it many times.  The only change I made was by not dipping in milk before coating it with the sesame seeds.

Tasted just like the cookies my grandmother made when we were growing up. Next time I will go to an Asian store for the sesame seeds to save on the cost. Definitely will be making them again.

I'm not sure why, but I added a 1/4 cup tahini paste and rolled the logs in the seeds without the milk.   These are a little time consuming, but so good.

I used part granulated sugar and part brown sugar.  I prefer vanilla extract for flavoring. I also used part of the dough and formed balls (also dipped in milk and rolled in sesame seeds) and made thumbprints using my strawberry jam. Be sure to add jam before cooking. Absolutely delicious!!

This recipe is AWESOME!  I didn't have anise extract so I used Vanilla and it was great.  I didn't did them in milk either.  I rolled them into balls and then rolled them in the sesame seeds.  They came out evenly coated and baked into a nice round cookie.  My daughter loves them plain as well (with no sesame seeds).  It's a great cookie.  Next time I may try lemon extract or almond extract.  I made some with roasted sesame seeds and some with unroasted sesame seeds.  Both are wonderful.

just like my grandma used to make, however, I make them with LARD to get the crisp texture I remember. I also turn these into frosted butter cookies , by using butter and vanilla extract. I think I increase the sugar in the butter version to 1 full cup.

Turned out really good. I used less sugar and butter (1/2 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup of butter) and substitute milk for fresh orange juice. Also added vanilla and cinnamon powder (1 teaspoon of each) the smell of anise is really beautiful.
