This is almost exactly the same recipe my dad made for us when I was a kid he would use mayo instead of whipping cream though. A basic carrot salad that's great with almost any meal and of course you can add other things if you wanted more variety.

I was not clear on what was meant by whipped cream.  I used fat free cool whip. I put extra rasins. Was good. I will make again.

Very tasty salad quick and easy. I did use an extra cup of whipped cream. Will definitely make this salad again.

great idea but I substituted the whip cream for non-fat plain yogurt. I also added walnuts and extra raisins (1/2 of which were golden raisins)

Its fast and easy. I substitute all purpose cream to whipped cream then I added salt and pepper to taste and double up the volume of raisins. Its great!

Not bad not great. I didn't waste the carrots with this dish because well I love carrots so I'll eat them anyway.
