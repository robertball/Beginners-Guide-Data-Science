Despite the simplicity of this recipe, it turns out a gravy which is lump free, rich, golden brown in appearance, and most importantly, delicious. I was skeptical that a recipe with so few ingredients would be worthwhile, but not to worry, it was excellent in every regard. If you are using drippings from the pan, I recommend straining the drippings into another bowl to get rid of any meat, vegetables or foreign matter that may be in the roasting pan. This will produce a smoother gravy. Finally, I was in a hurry so I combined all of the ingredients while they were at room temperature and whisked before placing on the stove and it worked fine, causing no lumps whatsoever.

B+. Good recipe although no need for so much flour- a few teaspoons will suffice.

I used the broth and drippings from a heavily seasoned bone-in turkey breast that I made in my crockpot.  Extremely easy and delicious!

FABULOUS! The taste was PERFECT! This was my first time cooking Thanksgiving dinner and this was SO easy and I got rave reviews. We had 10 people for dinner, next time I'll double the recipe (even though it says it makes it for 16), thank you SO MUCH!

This was oh so simple, and indeed it turned out delicious! I was roasting a boneless turkey roast so there was not much dripping to use. However, that was not a problem and the whole thing came together nicely. I like my gravy not too thick so I just used 1 tablespoon of flour and actually still had to thin it out some more with a few tablespoons each of water and vegetable broth. Overall, I would definitely use this recipe again! P.S. I used Knor's turkey gravy mix

A really good gravy. It's a bit on the thick side, especially after refrigeration. If you don't have enough turkey drippings, just supplement with chicken broth. It's very savory!

I have made this gravy every Thanksgiving for the past 5 years and it never fails me. I make double and triple batches depending on the crowd. Once complete I put into a crockpot to stay perfect. Family always comments on how good it is! There is nothing better than a crockpot full of gravy!!!

Definitely a hit on garlic sour cream mashed potatoes; easy to prepare. I used a cup of whole milk with a cup of water (instead of two cups of water), a pinch of salt and pepper,  I will use again.

Followed recipe exactly it was delicious, easy to make, smooth, and not to salty. Ever since I first made the gravy, I'm asked to make the gravy any time their is a family gathering  that involves a turkey dinner.

This was good gravy and my family said they liked it too. It seemed a little too salty. This may be from the brine I used to prepare the turkey. I'm not sure. I followed recipe as instructed.

I thought the flavor was GREAT! It was a bit on the salty side, but I attribute that to the salt used in the brine prior to cooking. Good stuff!

Fantastic! I was worried about using gravy mix, but the use of turkey drippings made this very flavorful, with a smooth texture. Plus, it’s super easy! Followed the recipe exactly.

Sooo good! I didn’t even add water... just pan drippings. It was pretty thick, so I thinned it with Swanson’s chicken stock. I’ll never make gravy another way again!!

Had our menu planned ahead of time for Thanksgiving and I totally forgot about gravy at the last minute.  I needed something super quick using the turkey drippings.  While the turkey was baking, I went ahead and threw the other 3 ingredients in a pan ready to go.  I used roasted chicken gravy mix because that's all I had.  Also added a dash of black peppers.
