The recipe proportions are a little off for me. I think that there is too much buttermilk egg and butter for the recipe. However I made it for two. We had about 4 ounces of halibut each. I used about 2/3 cup of buttermilk and only one egg. I used about a teaspoon of melted butter for each fillet and if I weren't watching my health I would have used more but 1 teaspoon each was enough. I used Triscut Rye/Caraway crackers. I wasn't sure that the caraway would be a good mix for the fish. Oh my goodness....my first bite I thought wow this would be great on chicken and then I had another bite and I have to say the flavors really meshed for us. I will be using this basics of this recipe for many other recipes for both fish and chicken. Thanks!!!! Plain Ole Bob and Thank you for your service too Sir!

I have made this numerous times and it always comes out very moist and tastey. Everyone who has had it loves it.

I too like to experiment and my husband has the one taste bud he is guarding so I changed the seasoning to Tony's Creole seasoning the crackers to saltines and used chicken thighs as the meat. It was easy and my husband loved it. Finally! He gave a thumbs up on my chicken. Thank you!

Everyone in the family including my five year old grandson ate and ate until there was no more. They all agreed that although it was saltier than we would have liked it was the best fish recipe ever. I used Triscuit rye crackers and followed the recipe exactly. Next time though I'll try using a less expensive fish of similar density.

I certainly did a double take when I read this recipe set oven at 250 degrees?? really?? I liked the coating and the fish turned out great nothing like fresh halibut fillets I baked the fish for 20 minutes at 400 degrees turned out perfect.

Needs some gravy was the hubby's observation. But I think it tasted well.
