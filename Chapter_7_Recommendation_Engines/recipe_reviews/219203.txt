While the recipe did take some time, everyone loved this. I used a bit more garlic and more of the dressing, otherwise this was great. I ended up sprinkling more of the cilantro on top as part of the presentation.

I  thought these were delicious. I did not have less sodium taco seasoning so i used sloppy joe. Tons of flavor and hardly any calories. The cilantro is rockin' in it.

I didn't have any taco seasoning, so I substituted 1 tsp. "Arizona Dreaming"  (a Penzy southwest salt free alternative). I also used taco seasoned cheese.  These were delicious!
