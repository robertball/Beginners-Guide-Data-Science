I used a 14 oz can of peaches, and even added a small amount of the syrup. It stretched the sauce out, which was great, as the sauce on rice was very good.

Would add some spice (cayenne?) next time for zip, but otherwise a tasty recipe.

I made a whole lot of changes to this recipe and was really pleased with the result. I used 1/2 tsp lemon juice instead of a lemon (added with the water) and halved 8 ripe apricots instead of the peach.  I also changed the cooking method, after browning the chicken, I put it in a dish in a medium oven whilst I made the sauce, according to the recipe, up to addding the water when I also added the apricots.  All this warm sauce was poured over the browned drumsticks and baked for around half an hour.  The sauce thickened in the oven so I didn't use any cornflour. The chicken was so juicy and the flavor beautifully ballanced, not too much of any one.

Very good, though it had more of a honey-lemon than peach flavour. I added a tablespoon of cornstarch instead of a teaspoon and liked the consistency of the sauce that I got. The peaches we had on hand were pretty small so I used two instead of one.  When I reheated the leftovers on the stove the next day, I cooked a little extra sauce and added more peach since we had eaten most of the fruit when we ate the dish fresh.  This brought out the peach flavour nicely. Thanks for a great recipe!  I will be making this again.  Edit: The second time I made this I used 2 regular sized peaches - I was glad I did.  They were not overpowering but gave a nice flavour.  I put in 1 tsp of cornstarch, like the recipe calls for.  I found the sauce very runny and will be sure to use 1 Tbsp in the future.  Even though the sauce didn't thicken like I hoped it would, we still really enjoyed the meal.

Really good.  I would make with chicken thighs the next time, so you don't have to work around the bone.  I also used canned peaches and would add more peaches next time.

It was delicious, but next time I will use much less lemon (one or two slices), because lemon covered the aroma of honey and peaches.

Instead of using drumsticks I cut breasts into strips.  I also followed another suggestion and used a Tbsp of cornstarch instead of a tsp.  I served it over white rice and my husband loved it!  Even better as leftovers after reheating.  I think next time I'll try dicing the chicken after browning the strips.

This recipe is "just okay" as another reviewer aptly put it. Nothing to brag about, it's not delightfully infused with this delicious peachy taste... maybe if you double the peaches and the honey and marinate everything a really long time... I don't think I'll be making this one again though.

Thanks for posting this recipe! I have to say: my rating is for what I made -- which was not this exact dish, but one inspired by it. Had to make variations allowing for what our freezer/pantry held, but this was a forgiving recipe.  Used 4 drumsticks and 2 bone/skinless thighs. Subbed fresh grated ginger (which I sauteed at beginning w/ garlic and onions), and 1/2 lime thinly sliced.  Used large can of pineapples instead of peaches which seemed to go very well with the Asian flavors. Decided to broil the drumsticks for a few minutes while the sauce was simmering down, and I'm glad I did as it added a nice color and texture to the skin.  Next time I'd marinate the chicken in the juice from the can of pineapples (plus a little soy sauce, and maybe garlic and ginger)...if I plan ahead!

Taste was not what I was expecting - somewhat bland.  The chicken did come out moist.  I don't think I'll be making this again any time soon.

I followed the instructions to the letter and needed more cook time. I use a gas stove and it cooks slower than others I've had.  I left it in for 1 1/2 hours and they were tender and tasted great.  Next time I'm going to jam to the recipe for some sweetener.

Yum! Made this tonight and it was a huge hit, even with the kids! I did use light canned peaches, and added just a little bit of the juice.

I made this almost exactly as written, except I used "peach honey" instead of honey and peaches. I also used stock instead of water. So I guess not exactly as written. Very flavorful. Officially in the dinner rotation!

This was very tasty.  I used canned peaches because I didn't have any fresh.  I think it worked out better because I added about half of the can both peaches and juice and the flavor came through wonderfuly.  I didn't use any cornstarch to thicken the sauce since I put the whole pan in the oven to help cook the chicken.  (Mine were still a little frozen when I started cooking.)  I will be making this again.  The chicken skin was glazed and crispy and wonderful.

i wanted to try a new recipe for drumsticks and this was great. i followed the recipe but added a tad bit more soy sauce, honey and ginger. also i added a dash of hot pepper flakes. my family loved this dish and i will make it again for sure. also, i'm thinking of using just the soy/ginger/honey mixture as a summer marinade for bbqs...thanks!

We really like SE Asian foods so I was interested to see how this turned out. I left off the lemon (mainly because I didn't have any fresh ones on hand), used home canned peaches and 2 Tbsp honey. I also sprinkled with lemon pepper after it was all on the serving platter. I thought this was lacking in flavor and you couldn't really taste the peach *or* the honey. A 3-star by my tastes, but I'll give these a 4 because my husband thought this was good (he liked the sweetness) and wants me to make it again.

We didn't care much for this recipe.  Of course, I didn't have ginger or the lemon (hubby doesn't like them anyway), so maybe that's the problem.  Also, the garlic at that heat got burnt.  Still, it had a wierd combo of flavors for our liking.  Hubby and the kids wouldn't even touch the peaches because they said the sauce made them taste wierd.  Also, I found eating drumsticks through such a sticky sauce messy and tedious.  I really wanted to like this, but didn't really.  Unfortunately, I won't be trying it again.

This recipe was super easy and delicious. I served it over rice, which was great. I used canned peaches as well, which was fine and the syrup added to the sauce. I used a bit more cornstarch though, to thicken the sauce up. Great dish - even my toddler loved it. :)

My kids and I weren't fans of this. I think you may need very ripe/sweet peaches Either way, the sauce was a too starchy and a bit bland.

Sooooooo delicious!  I used canned peaches and substituted the water with the syrup from the peaches.  I didn't have the lemons, but I really didn't need them.  Served over brown rice and it was so delicious.  Will be making this again and again.  Thanks for sharing.  :-)

This was really good. Didnt add the peach though as my kids thought it would be gross,but used some of the juice from a can of peaches. Also didnt add ginger because i dont like it and i had no lemons to add either. Other than that i follwed the recipe and it was good.

This was pretty tasty! After salting and peppering the drumsticks to taste, I increased all of the flavor components by about double based on some people saying it was bland, and I used chicken broth instead of water. I did two Tbsps. of cornstarch as someone else recommended. I also did what some others suggested and put fewer lemon slices after first juicing them into the sauce (about half a lemon), but it would probably be good the other way too. I followed the cooking method mostly as written (I did add the garlic later with the onion step) and the drumsticks came out tender and delicious. I used fresh peaches and did four instead of just one so there was lots of fruit. Overall, it mixed the flavors of tangy, sweet peaches and a mild Asian ginger sauce, and it all tasted great over rice. Wasn't too hard, either.

I thought it was good.  I used a can of peaches and added some of the syrup to the sauce.  I also didnt add the lemon (as I didnt have one at home) - and it was still pretty good - thank you

I did this recipe with 5 drumsticks. I did not use any onion and I used a tad bit more soy sauce then directed and I also only squeezed in some lemon juice (maybe a T worth)... ABSOLUTLY DELICIOUS!!!

I gave this a 4 because we liked it, but weren't 'wowed' by it as I had hoped.  I doubled it since I was making twice as many drumsticks than in the recipe.  Since we're in Canada, fresh peaches are not possible in February so I used two cans of sliced peaches and used the sauce in the cornstarch and water mix.  I did use more cornstarch as was suggested by others.  I really liked the peaches and honey taste (I used more honey).  However, if I was to make this again, I think I would skip the onions and garlic all together.

Initially I was really unsure about ginger, but was I wrong!. In the end all of the ingredients came together nicely.Great and easy to prepare.

I used an entire can of peaches and agree with another reviewer who said it could be a little spicier.  It was good, and I will most-likely make it again
