I made this for my husband and we both loved it!  I would recommend cooking the vegetable seperately since the rutubaga needs more time to cook and the other vegetables need less.  I didn't pre-cook the peas at all and just added the frozen peas directly to the meat along with the other vegetables.  I also would use a 15 oz. can of tomato sauce rather than 8 oz. because it didn't seem saucy enough (I added some left over pasta sauce we had in the fridge and it worked great).  For the potatoes I used a whole package of the frozen Ore Ida steam and mash potatoes and they worked great :)  Yummy!

This recipe made a quick, cheap meal that fed four people. To speed things up a bit, I used a frozen peas/carrots mix instead of fresh carrots and parsnips. I also used ground turkey instead of ground lamb. Be sure to use enough milk that the mashed potatoes are slightly runny.

I have been looking for a traditional version of Shepherd's Pie- this one was the closest I found. I used all the named ingredients, but I prepared them a little differently. After I browned the lamb, I took it out and drained it. Lots of fat. :) Then, in the pan I browned the lamb in, I added about 1/2 c white wine and threw in the other vegetable ingredients to cook through. I ended up adding about 1 cup of chicken stock as things progressed. I didn't want things dried up and I wanted a stew like consistency underneath the potato topping. I also went very heavy on the thyme, as the absolute best Shepherd's Pie I have ever tasted was at O'Lourdan's in Westminster and I racked my brain for days before identifying the most distinctive flavor as the lamb combined with thyme. I hate to be second guessing the original cook, but my question is, "Why, after going through all this to make an authentic SP, would one use instant, or prepared mashed potatoes?" I chose to do homemade, as have some others. The results were most astounding. And, if O'Lourdan's is in the least authentic, we got pretty close here. Thanks for a GREAT base recipe.

My husband and I loved this recipe as did my mother and father. I baked the pie in a 13x9 pan. I used hamburger in place of ground lamb. I think it would also be good with deer burger. The "with meat" review is based on the feedback of 3 family members. I also made a small dish without meat for myself, and I review that at the bottom of this post.  The pie is very filling, so I gave some of the pie to my mom and kept some of it for my husband and myself. All told, we got four (2 person) meals out of it. It also freezes well. I'm making it again tonight, and my mother requested the recipe.   You do taste the rutabagas alot, as I was hoping. It's a bit of a strange taste if you've never had them, but they are very good. (I had a rutabaga sandwich in London, but since I couldn't find a recipe for that, I decided on the Whitechapel pie.) I highly recommend this recipe as it is good for you, filling, rather cheap to make, and freezes well. It takes some time to cut up all the vegetables, but the result is well worth it.  VEGETARIANS: the recipe is great with soy "burger" crumbles. I've made it that way several times now, and I love it.

Curious - why do so many people substitute beef for lamb? It is called shepherd's pie for a reason. Look for Cottage pie recipes if you want to use beef. I like the modern method of using fresh ground lamb as most of us don't cook a roast so don't have the leftovers to grind for making this later in the week.

I actually substituted Ground beef for the lamb and used frozen peas with pearl onions and added a small can of portabella mushrooms as well as twice the tomato sauce.  Wow!!!  It's wonderful and easy to make.  It will become a regular at our house, Thanks!

Made it with half lamb and half beef. I was afraid all lamb would be too strong. Added extra tomato sauce as suggested. Cooked the parsnip and rutabaga in a separate pot for 15 minutes as suggested. Having never eaten these I was a bit nervous about using them for a dinner party, but they were good. Made the potatoes a little runny as someone suggested, but do not recommend this. I probably used more than 3 cups of mashed potatoes. It's a good recipe.

This was good, but it bears repeating that this dish is only going to be as savory as the spices you use to flavor it.  I used garlic powder liberally, as well as onion powder and about 1/2 tsp. of Old Bay.  I also added a little soy sauce, dry mustard (NOT the same as prepared mustard), chili sauce and a TB of brown sugar to the beef and I let the meat sit overnite in the fridge so the spices could really meld together.  To the beef and veggies mixture I added some of the starch water drained from the taters and I topped it with cheddar,  as Parmesan is just too bland to put on top of such a hearty dish.  I'll definitely make this again - it's a keeper.

We loved this sheperds pie. The rutabegas and parsnips really added a great flavor to this pie. I did make garlic mashed potatos to go on top and used ground beef instead of lamb.

Wonderful.  I had some leftover mashed potatoes with rutabagas  and that gave me the incentive to try this recipe. I did not have peas, so I used edamame, and I can't eat lamb(but love it) so I used ground turkey. Very tasty! I would make this again-hubby and I ate this two nights in a row.

I used Irish cheddar instead of Parmesan, and mixed it in with the potatoes.  I also added a small amount of fennel seed, and that really made the dish pop.  It looks and smells very nice, and was a big success at the table.  A keeper recipe, and quite affordable.  Having a food processor makes it easy to prepare.

I've made it several times now as per the recipe and wouldn't change a thing!  Very tasty!  ETA.  I've read several reviews that interpreted "prepared mashed potatoes" as boxed.  I assumed it meant already prepared from scratch, which is what I did every time.  :)

I like Shepherd's Pie with a crust on the bottom and sides; if you don't want to make you own, buy the refrigerated Pillsbury crusts - they're great and easy to use.  Then just line the baking pan/pot before putting the other ingredients in.

I pretty much followed the recipe exactly, except I used beef instead of lamb and I forgot to add sage and thyme, it still came out great but it probably could have been better. 

I used homemade mashed potatoes as opposed to prepared, because they are super easy to make and I can control what's in them.

I've never had rutabaga or parsnips before (one of the reasons I chose this recipe) and I found that I quite like them. Here's to expanding horizons, I guess.

This is a good basic comfort food meal.  I used ground beef instead of the lamb, and like many other reviewers, I doubled the tomato sauce and probably could have used more.  The filling was quite good, but I really regret using boxed mashed potatoes on top.  I haven't made boxed potatoes in a long time and they just didn't taste that great to me (little flavor, watered down), especially with all the milk to thin them out a bit.  I tried to salvage them with more seasoning, but oh well.  Luckily the rest was good enough to cover them up a bit.  But with all the pans on the stove (three pans and a casserole dish all said and done) I don't know if I'd want to take the effort to make them from scratch.

This was a very good dish. I didn't have celery or parsnip; but would throw them in if I did, no biggie. In my opinion tomato sauce detracts from the end result, and I never use it. I also opted for worcestershire sauce instead of sage or thyme, again just personal preference. And I have no problem substituting any ground meat on hand for the lamb. Very tasty recipe that you can tweak to your tastes.

I'm not a fan of lamb so we used buffalo/bison. This is one of our new, easy, yet so flavorful favorites! We could easily eat this every week. Highly recommend.

This worked out really well. I made the potatoes from scratch and didn't have the rutabaga, but everything else was great. I agree with the other reviewers that one more can of tomato sauce should be added to the recipe. The Parmesan cheese is the key here -- I would say the more the merrier!

I thought it was pretty good, everyone ate it with no complaints but I'd have to say I am more of a gravy type sauce rather than the tomato base one.

This was very good! I substituted the following:I used about 1/2 small bag of baby carrots,leftover sliced mushrooms for the parsnip and rutabaga.  Instead of frozen peas, I added a small can of peas to the beef mixture. I also used a 16 oz can of tomato sauce.

Easy to make and quick to serve.

Very good, I will use real potatoe next time, this time I used instant just because i was pressed for time...I don't know how I feel about the rutabaga, it tasted so good but I have never cooked with them before and had a lot of trouble cutting it, lol...It was super good though!Thank you!

I tried this recipe and my family loved it.  I didn't have a parsnip, but next time I'll try it with that. I added some sharp cheddar to the top before cooking....delicious!

This was good but there was way too much rutabaga. I would definitely not use a whole one. It also took longer than 15 minutes to get soft. Other than that, this is a good recipe.

I forgot to put in the peas but it was EXCELLENT! I cooked the rutabaga & parsnip a little longer than the carrots and celery as recommended by some others. Highly recommended. Don't substitute other meat, the lamb was great.

A hearty meal and makes great left overs. This was my first time cooking with rutabaga and think I put in too much. It is very strong and over powered the other veggies.  I took another reviewer's suggestion and used the larger can of tomato sauce.

Really good!  My eight year old daughter ate a third helping.  I didn't mention that it contained lamb, parsnips and rutabagas (any mention of these would make her turn up her nose).  I followed the recipe closely, but used store bought prepared mashed potatoes which I thinned with a little milk and added cheese. I made it a few days ahead and popped it in the oven covered in foil at around 300 degrees for almost 2 hours (I had to leave the house for a bit).  When I came home it was hot and bubbly, I just took of the foil to let the potatoes get a little crisp on top.  I think letting it cook slowly really let the flavors come together.  Great comfort food for a cold January MN night!

This was okay. A bit bland, in my opinion though.I used ground beef instead of lamb, and kernel corn instead of peas. Based on other reviews, I increased the tomato sauce to about 12 oz, but found it a bit liquidy. It also required a 9 x 13 baking dish.

After a few modifications this recipe turned out wonderfully! I used instant garlic mashed potatoes to save time. I didn’t use any rutabaga, but added a whole can of early peas, doubled the parsnips, and added a can of mushrooms. I also used a 15oz can of tomato sauce. 
I’ll definitely be making this again!

Have made this three times now. Most recently adjusted the ingredients to make it low FODMAP. Swapped out green beans for peas, used the green part of green onions, skipped the garlic, made tomato sauce from tomato paste. My diet sensitive son LOVED it.

Good basic recipe. I scaled it up and used equal parts pork and venison. I'd also cook the parsnips and rutabega separately as they need more time and I'd skip cooking frozen peas. I folded the veggies into the meat in a large bowl before putting it all in the baking dish. I used red potatoes for the mash and used sour cream and butter to taste to make them spreadable. Would also add more sauce.

Delicious. Though, since neither grocery store near me had any lamb, I had to make this with ground beef instead (hence, it was actually cottage pie). I also used a few fresh tomatoes instead of tomato sauce, since my partner doesn't like canned tomatoes or sauce - and I made full-on mashed potatoes, with almond milk, Earth Balance, salt, and pepper (we're lactose intolerant). Oh - and they didn't have any rutabagas, so I used a turnip instead. And fresh thyme instead of dried. But pretty close to the original recipe, and quite delicious!

Will make again for SURE.  Glad I used the ground lamb. Just has a different taste, steps it up to a different level.  I, too, put a bottom crust on it, (bought premade at store) and baked it without filling for about 12 minutes so it wouldn’t be soggy. Used a jar of premade chicken gravy instead of the tomato sauce. Used 2 premade mashed potato packages found at bacon/sausage section of store. Roasted  the cut veggies on sheet pan ahead  of time so they’d be cooked through. We LOVED it.

Made this the first time as written, and it was devoured and complimented by the whole family. Have made many times since, using various mixed veg proportions and leftover roasts. Delicious every time. Depending on the age of the spices, I often increase those proportionally. It seems impossible to make this come out badly.

A hit with my family;  they were amazingly quiet during dinner which means they were enjoying their food!  I didn't have tomato sauce so I used 6oz of paste and diluted with roughly 4oz of water with good results.  I used 3 large baking potatoes to make the mashed which probably yielded 5-6 c of mashed potatoes, so a nice generous amount on top.

I had never made Shepherd's pie before, and this was an easy recipe to follow. My husband loved it. I did not have the parsnip or rutabaga, and I used ground beef instead. I added a little Worcestershire sauce to the mix too. It still turned out to be delicious!....

3/16/2017 So, I made this again only this time I did have the parsnips and the rutabaga! I still used ground beef, but it was absolutely delicious! I took it to work for a St. Patty's pot luck and there was nothing left!

I made this thinking my boyfriend wouldn't really like it because of the vegetables but he loved it. I did as some of the other reviews suggested and doubled the tomato sauce, and used white wine and chicken broth to cook the vegetables in. I also doubled the mashed potatoes. It was very good and I will definitely make it again.

Simple to make & delicious. I used ground beef but I can't wait to try it with lamb! I also used about 13 oz of tomato sauce to insure moistness. Leftovers eat wonderfully.

Very good and hardy.  Like others have said I used a 16oz can of tomato sauce and 11x9 baking pan.  Lol at 4 servings.

My first attempt making Shepherd's Pie; total success!!! Omitted peas, substituted ground turkey for lamb. A few other tweaks, but overall a really awesome recipe.

I loved this. I was home sick with a cold and didn't want to go shopping so I did have to improvise.  I didn't have parsnip or rutabaga, I did have a good lb of mushrooms, I cooked them separately in olive oil with garlic.  I added them to the vegetables before baking after draining them.  I didn't have sage, I did add a bit of cinnamon.  I used both sweet and regular potatoes.  I used beef instead of lamb.  There is way more then 4 servings.  6 conservatively.  VERY good, I also added chopped chives to the mashed potatoes.
