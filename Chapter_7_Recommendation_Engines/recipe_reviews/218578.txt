Definitely taste the Kool-aid!  Wouldn't recommend using even half the packet in the dough!

Makes a lot, easy to make and really enjoyed the "brings me back to being a kid" flavor.  My 7 year old grand daughter loved them!

Made exactly by recipe, yet no matter how small I made the donut, they would turn dark brown with a raw center.  If I ever make these again, they will not be deep fried, and yes, I used a deep fat fryer thermometer.  I will buy a donut pan and bake them.

These were so much fun to make.  My kids mixed while my hubby fried.  It was a nice change from the usual choc chip or peanut butter cookie.    Using the Kool-Aide as instructed gave it a rich flavor that was completely diffrent than other cookies.
