This recipe is delicious...however I double it and use one can of whole kernel corn and one can of cream corn. It makes the texture just right!

This was very easy to make but got really good feedback from my guests. I didn't put any bacon in it but didn't feel it was missing a thing.

I did this entire dish on the stove top b/c the oven was already occupied.  I made the cheese sauce first by adding some flour and let the bacon flavor the sauce, then added the corn at the end til heated thru. Hubby was in love.

I was a little dissapointed with this.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using a 15 oz can or corn instead of 10 oz (it was all I had on hand),  the cheese and milk did not come together to form a sauce like I was expecting.  Hovever, I am giving four stars, as the flavor was good, and my boyfriend loved it, he gobbled it all up before he even touched his chicken (totally unheard of for him to eat his veggies before his meat!)  I will probably make again, just because he loved it so much, and it was quick and easy.

This one I am not sure I did it right, it did not turn out with a creamy sause or anything, the cheese did not want to stay mixed with the corn, but clump together. Maybe I goofed it. But THANKS for the recipe anyway.

I loved it. I cooked this dish for my mother and almost ate it before she could fix a plate. It's so quick and so easy to make, you don't have to cook the corn before or melt the cheese or heat the milk or anything, you just mix and heat the oven. It's great.

Not a fan; it was way too salty for my taste. Perhaps if the salt and bacon were omitted it would have been better...?

Picked this recipe to use with my special education students because of its simplicity. Turned out ok, would not recommend using Bacos.

This dish was very easy to make. I enjoyed but my husband didn't care for it. He is a very picky eater but i thought I'd try it. He didn't like the bacon bits in it so next time i'll try w/out the bacon bits.

Chopped up 4 slices of bacon and cooked with the suggested 1/2C chopped onion. When done, turned off heat and added about 1C (heaping) frozen corn to let the corn thaw, while completing other prep.  Followed recipe as directed, aside from not adding any salt, and came out perfect.
Enjoyed the flavors, though given the fat and sodium content with the bacon and the cheese, wouldn't make it often, but since we were eating as a side to very lean meat, felt a little better about this dish.
I think that adding some diced green or jalepeno pepper and a clove of garlic would be a nice variation too.

I love that I found a new & interesting way to prepare what could otherwise be a boring side dish: CORN. I used 10oz frozen corn because I don't do canned veggies. (Nutritional content is slightly better with frozen veggies!) And we only drink almond milk in this household, so since I wasn't sure how our Vanilla Almond Milk would taste in this recipe, I put a splosh of almond milk in, and also generous dollop of sour cream. I think the sour cream really helped make the dish tasty and substituted well for the cow's milk.
Normally not a fan of bacon bits but we happened to have some in the pantry, so I am really glad to have a recipe to use them in!

Maybe it was because I used frozen corn but the dish was very watery with chunks of cheddar and bacon stuck together. It tasted "O.K" but probably won't use agian.

As others have said... it's corn, cheese, and bacon.  The cheddar didn't create a sauce, it just became stringy.  Perhaps a different cheese and a different vegetable, but then that would be a different recipe.

This tasted good but it was basically clumps of cheese mixed in to the corn. I never could get it to smooth out into a sauce.

This recipe was basically just corn and cheese, and that is what it tasted like! I omitted the bacon bits because of reading past reviews. I thought it was good, however my father didn't care for it. It's a very simple, quick, side dish. I thought it could have used a little extra of something else.

I love corn, cheese and bacon, but together in this meal is very wrong.  I will end up just using what I made in another dish just to get rid of it !
