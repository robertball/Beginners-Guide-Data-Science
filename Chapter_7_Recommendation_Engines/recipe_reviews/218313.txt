You can also use a garlic press to squeeze jalapeno juice out of thick slices.

Did some work in the garden today and I have Jalapenos galore!  Stumbled across this recipe and WOW what a great afternoon treat to beat the 90 degree heat!  (hehehe I am a poet and didn't even know it).  The Margarita was delicious-- I didn't have agave and used Sweet and Sour Mix with some Rose's Lime Juice.  Very Good although I think I will try to muddle the jalapeno on the next batch.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Minus the jalapeno we call these Skinny Rita's. I'm going to give this a try this evening. Lots of jalapeno's in my garden. I'll let you know. BTW I would use lime to moisten the rim of the glass.

LOVED THEM.  SO DID MY HUSBAND.  WHEN SHAKED WITH SEEDLESS BUT FRESH JALAPENOS, YOU GET A NICE MILD SPICE.  IF YOU WANT A MORE BURNING YOUR LIPS KIND OF DRINK, MUDDLE THE JALAPENOS A BIT IN THE SHAKER BEFORE ADDING OTHER INGREDIENTS.  FIRE!

Easier to prepare and better tasting with Tanteo Jalapeno-infused Tequila.  Tanteo blends 6 different jalapeno macerations using natural whole jalapenos and 100% agave blanco tequila so that we can all enjoy perfect spicy margaritas without the consistency issues of using jalapenos in the shaker.  Try it.  It will change the way you drink margaritas at home.

Excellent drink!  I cut my half jalapeno into pieces before shaking the whole thing and it's nice and zippy on the lips!  Also, I used a big glass and made one jumbo margarita out of the recipe; that way one is plenty!!

Not bad! Next time I'd muddle the jalapeno a bit to get more of the spicy flavor. Also I didn't have agave nectar, so I subbed Rose's sweetened lime juice; but I think it'd be better with the agave nectar+lime juice. It's definitely a strong margarita!

If you love this recipe you should try Tanteo Tequila! They make an AMAZING Jalapeno Tequila. You just need a shot and a half of Tanteo Jalapeno, juice from a lime and some agave nectar and of course ice.

I skipped the triple sec and fresh Jalapeno and used Tanteo Jalapeno Tequila instead.  That made it fantastic!

I've had a similar margarita using chipolte chile powder.  They also rimmed the glass with a mixture of the chipolte chile powder and salt.  It was yummy and so addicting, however, my lips were burning by the end of the second drink.

I, too, used the Jalapeño tequila Timoteo and followed the recipe without the actual jalapeños.   Excellent.

I liked this recipe a lot! I like things to be pretty spicy, so the first time I made it I left the seeds in and let it sit for a while but it still wasn’t quite hot enough for me. The second time I made it I muddled the jalapeño and that made it perfect!

I used diet sprite only to leave out the sugar it probably is the best as written with the triple sec and aguave nectar but it was great with a little diet sprit if you want to lower the sugar

I used green thai chilies instead of jalapeños.
I garnished with a whole red thail chili in each glass, which looked rad.
Not too spicy, but has a great kick. 
I'll make it again!

The garlic press for the jalapeños is a great idea; I also add a little cilantro.  I've made these for a number of people and everyone wants the recipe!  If you aren't able to juice your own limes, I measured mine and it was about 4oz worth.

I was looking for a recipe similar to the Popper Margarita from OTB and this is it. I added a bit more agave nectar and garnished with a couple of fresh jalapeño slices and this is an excellent recipe! A little strange sounding, but once you try it, you'll love it!
