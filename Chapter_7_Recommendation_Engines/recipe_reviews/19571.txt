This is very good and easy to make but you either need to wait to make it until serving time or reheat it at serving time. It thickens and becomes unpourable as it sits. I had made it early and had to remelt it-which took about 5 minutes. But is was such a great addition and made a lovely presentation that it is definitely worth the little effort it took.

This was really good, but a lot gooier than I expected.  I think a little less corn syrup would make this easier to pour.

I made this recipe to a T and had problems.  I put this on some crepes and the sauce got so hard in a matter of seconds it was unedible.  I even warmed it up and dipped right into the bowl and it still started to harden up while I chewed and got so chewy it felt like it was going to pull my fillings out.  I'm guessing A LOT less corn syrup...but I don't know...I'm not sure I'll even be attempting this one anymore.

I had some issues getting it to stay pourable because it thickened quickly and it was not fun to glob it on the pancakes I made.
