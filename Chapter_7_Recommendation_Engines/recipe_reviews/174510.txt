These are good. I didn't use BUITONI products because I already had some frozen cheese ravioli and pesto. These are tasty and pretty fun to make (I pretended mine were hats and called them the Church Ladies), but I didn't like how the oil from the pesto seeped into the ravioli as they sat. You wouldn't want these to sit around too long at a party or they start looking tired. Still, fun idea. Thanks for the recipe!

Went over welll at book club just breaded, baked with a side of marinara, but they were a little tough and not too much flavor.  Need to be served/eaten right away or they get tough.

good, easier way to make toasted ravioli in bulk and probably a little healthier too since you don't fry them.  Even my little girl thought they were yummy, she snuck some from the pan!

H ate some but wasn't impressed.  I thought they made an attractive presentation, and will use again when son comes home from college.
