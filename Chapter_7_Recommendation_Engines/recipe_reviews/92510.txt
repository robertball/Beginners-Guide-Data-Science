one of the best salads I've ever had. Added jalepenos and avacado to teh salad, and used olive oil, a little white vinegar and a glop of sour cream to make the dressing thicker, it was PERFECT!

Then let me be the first reviewer.  I customized up to 42 servings and served it on a large tray in a buffet line with some other mexican dishes.  Made it pretty much as stated in the recipe.  I'd say it did the job and they ate it all.  I only got a little bit of scrapings that were left for me at the end (I usually eat last when I make these big dinners), so my rating is based on the fact that they ate it all and seemed happy.  It did make a very nice presentation because it was quite spread out instead of confined to a bowl and turned out to be a very visually appealig dish to open up a buffet line.

This was delicious! If you wanted to, you could substitute the salad ingredients to suit you (think avocado, etc.). This went great with our Mexican themed night. Ole!

The dressing was fresh, light and delicious!  I used parsley instead of cilantro, simply because I don't like cilantro.  I'll make this again.

This turned out well!  Loved the dressing.  It was light and tasty, and all the ingredients were something I always have on hand.  I would definately make this again!
