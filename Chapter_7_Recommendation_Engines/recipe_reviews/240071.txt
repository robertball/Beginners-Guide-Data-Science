Made as written except  mine was ready in 8 hours. I think 12  hours is too long. Other than that, this was perfect as written.

Delicious. I also shortened the time to 8 hours and it was perfect. I let my meat sit in the brine overnight to lock in some extra flavor as well. Would highly recommend this recipe!
