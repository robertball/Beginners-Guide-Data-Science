Quick and delicious! This was really hit the spot for lunch and I didn't feel guilty about it either! I used a plum tomato that I lightly salted and instead of balsamic vinaigrette I just drizzled with a little olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  Very easy and tasty!

This is a good, baseline, inspirational recipe. I am running low on groceries, so I literally used what's on hand: regular bread + sliced american cheese! It was still so good and very satisfying. I omitted balsamic altogether, although a little may have grounded the sandwich. I also eliminated pepper. Looking forward to making it again with quality bread. Yum!
