I disagree with the previous comments.  We have this recipe quite frequently with nothing extra and my family loves it!!!  In fact, my daughter is an extremely picky eater and she loves it as well. Thank you Del. :)

My ex-boyfriends Grandmother made these and they are delicious. You might want some salt and pepper but to keep it simple and light don't over season them, let the salmon speak for itself.

This would be tasteless.  Drain the salmon and add 2-3 slices of bread that you have soaked in water.  Add garlic powder, about a tbsp of worcestershire sauce, egg, onion or minced onion, and one shot of hot pepper sauce.  Make the patties, dredge in flour and then fry in oil.  I always keep canned salmon in the pantry and the family knows that when I make these, I've run out of everything else!  But we love them!

I think this recipe is great as is or to add a little spice per your flavor preference.  I love that this uses the self rising flour rather than corn meal or bread crumbs.  I can flatten these patties out real thin and they still puff up nicely.  My Kids LOVE these.  I sautéed a little onion and put in a little old bay seasoning and they were fantastic!  The Kids call them “Fish Cookies” (they are 2 and 4years old).  Also, don’t fret if you don’t have self rising flour, make your own. It’s a ratio; for each cup of all-purpose flour, add 1 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon of salt.

My mother made salmom patties like this and I have continued the tradition.  My family loves them.  I would not recommend adding anything to the mixture.

this was a great tip..using the self rising flour. I used pancake mix and it worked very well.made the patties light. i did however add dill weed and chopped onion, as well as garlic and some cilantro i had on hand. thanks for the flour tip Del. I will try this with crab too!

After bing snowed in for a week, I was raiding the cupboards in search of food and found a can of salmon.  I looked for a recipe that didn't call for bread crumbs or saltines, cornflakes...because I didn't have them on hand.  This recipe was perfect!  I did add some onion, dill, garlic salt, and pepper.  I also dredged them in flour before frying and they turned out crispy on the outside-moist inside-& very flavorful!  YUMMO!

This recipe is an old fashioned Southern style one.... I love it just the way it is.  If it's too bland, just add a little salt and pepper, and a dash of Worcestershire sauce.  Otherwise, I love it as is.

I could not believe the reviewer who had not even tried this recipe and said it would be tasteless, and then wrote her/his own!  I use a recipe with the same ingredients (but with a slight variation) and I also add onions (because we like onions!), and it is great.  You get the flavor of the salmon, not a bunch of other stuff.  One should not knock a recipe before trying it! If you don't think it is good just post your own!

These almost made me cry, they were so evocative of my childhood.  They tasted just the way my mom and my grandma made them.  My husband said the same thing about his mom, I guess these are such a part of growing up in the south.  Everyone in my house loved them.  I had to use bisquick instead of self-rising flour, but really, isn't it about the same?  I also added a few shakes of onion powder, old bay, salt and pepper.  Although they would have been fine on their own.  The patties fried up brown and crispy on the outside, creamy and delicious on the inside.  Everyone loved these, even the picky 8 y/o.  Thank you so much for this childhood favortite!!

Proof positive that you don't have to add a bunch of vegetables and  to fish to enjoy it.  All I added was some garlic-flavor Mrs. Dash, and used cornmeal instead of flour. Keep it basic, and you're fine!

I chose this recipe for salmon patties because I had all of the indgredients on hand.  I will never make my old recipe again!  It was super easy because you don't have to bread the patties, and the self-rising flour made them bind together perfectly.  I added a little onion powder just because of personal preference, but otherwise didn't change a thing.  Delicious, and my kids loved them!

Reminds me of the simple but fantastic Salmon Patties mu grandmother used to make.  I spent YEARS trying to copy her and just now figured out that I tried to use to much in the recipe!  Thanks so much!

These turned out so good.  My husband loved them.  My batch made 6 big patties.  I used 1/4 cup of flour and 1/4 cup panko bread crumbs, which made for a crispier crust.  Everything held together without any problems.  Next time, I'll add finely chopped celery for a little more texture.

Very, very, good.  My modifications: I used thawed, boneless, salmon skinless filets; I broke them up with my fingers.  To that I added coarsely chopped onion.  I used two eggs as well.  All that ended up being a pretty sticky mixture so my patties really benefited from being dredged through more flour prior to placing them into the sunflower in my wok.  Surprisingly good considering how easy they were to make.  I can't wait to make them again.

When I saw only 3 ingredients I did wonder about flavor, but after reading the reviews gave this recipe a try.  It is wonderful!  My husband said, "why put in other ingredients to mees with the flavor of the salmon?"  They were puffy, tender, crunchy . . we lloved the patties.  Thanks for this recipe!

Very easy.  A little bland but would probably be excellent with some sort of lemony sauce.

This is the best and only salmon cake recipe for me. But I did add a lot of extra black pepper and some chopped onions.  I served with a dill sauce which was sour cream, a little horseradish, some lemon juice and dill.  I think it would work nicely with hush puppies with a little green hot sauce.

I have made these salmon patties several times and they are delicious!  The only variation I have made to this recipe is I sprinkle some fresh ground black pepper on each patty as they are frying in the pan.  If you are cooking for one, the leftover patties freeze very nicely in a ziplok freezer bag and they thaw out in no time at all.  I reheat them in my toaster oven as I'm cooking tater tots as a side dish.

These are fabulous. I've been searching for a really good - but simple - salmon patties recipe because every time I make them, they fall apart. The self-rising flour is a great idea because it's much finer than regular flour and it holds the salmon and the egg together perfectly. All I added was a little salt & pepper and served them with pea sauce. If you think they're too bland (I think they're perfect as is) then simply add your own spices to taste. This simple, yet delicious recipe is a winner.

This recipe was great! I've got 2 young kids (10 & 7) that loved it & my husband gave his approval since he's the only one of us that had ever had these before. The only change I made was to add about 3 tbsp green onion. Next time I will probably add 1/4 tsp salt, just to enhance taste.

very bland, and sorting thru the canned salmon was a real pain.  I don't think these are worth the effort of making again.

Thanks for the flour tip! I have made these for years and everyone in the family loves them and eats them hot or cold. I use saltine crackers crushed real fine with a roller, then season with salt, pepper, and garlic salt. I then fry them in olive oil. This is a recipe that the entire family will love and beg you for.-Richard

These were good, but I added green onions, salt and pepper.  The inside was a bit to flour tasting for me, but they were still good.

This is exactly what my DH wanted me to make. And because they are so easy and tasty I won't mind doing it regularly. I had never had salmon patties before and didn't know what to expect but I really enjoyed these. So did my two little kids. This could easily be a go-to dinner on a busy night.

My 3 year old is having seconds and my 6 year old says they are "kind of good". They finished these without a fight and that's amazing! I added 1 tsp seasoned salt, a spoonful of garlic and 3/4 tsp baking soda. Just great, thanks!

This is the way my Great Grandma used to make her salmon patties and boy have I missed them!  A fantastically simple Southern recipe.  Now if I could just make up some biscuits to go with them :)  Thanks Del and Dad!

This was good. Now, I'm a southern girl so I like my food to taste like the food I'm cookin.  This was perfect because there weren't a bunch of ingredients to overpower the salmon.  I did add onions and used Italian Bread Crumbs instead of flour.

Very good and simple. Add seasoning to your own taste. Good standby when you haven't taken anything out of the freezer or need a quick dinner.

Made two batches: one as written and one adding salt, pepper and green onion.  I love green onion, but my kids don't.  So even though I love adding spices and seasoning to everything, I love getting my younger kids to eat fish.  5 stars as is!!!  Served with ketchup for the younger crowd, cocktail and tartar sauce for the traditionalists and a cilantro-lime mayo for me

I made gluten-free salmon patties a la Del's Dad, and used Ashley Adams' DIY self-rising flour instructions. I then added only a pinch of sea salt and pepper, 

Del's Daddy's patties were so delisch, I grabbed one to gnosh on while watching a DVD -- instead of a cookie!

The ingredients look too simple but it works and makes great slightly puffed very crisp salmon patties. My husband won't eat them any other way now.

A classic! I love this recipe! I grew up having the exact salmon patties.  I've tried other recipes.  Using bread crumbs or adding things for flavor,  but out never turned out as good as these.  Why fix it if it ain't broken right!?!

I made these with egg replacer (since I am intolerant) and rice flour (for my son who can't eat wheat).  So yummy! My family loved them. I followed some of the other reviewers and dredged in the rice flour and since rice flour is a little gritty, made it very crunchy.

Great recipe.  Four star rating due to lack of seasoning.  Definitely add a simple seasoning to the salmon and it will be perfect!  Even my pickiest eater (she's 9) had 4 of them!!!

First time I made this I noticed the texture and taste wasn't what I was used to so I called my Mother. She told me to use half cornmeal and half flour. Turned out perfect! I also added dried onions and salt and pepper. Have added finely shredded cheese. My children and grandchildren ask me to cook it for them often.

very good base recipe which can be spiced up to your preference.  I added some Old Bay and a little garlic and onion powder. I did like using the self-rising flour instead of cracker meal. I think it gave the exterior a better "crunch"  while pan frying.
I'll make this again.

Like another commenter said, it seemed pretty bland so I added garlic, onion, S&P, worchestershire, and a dash of hot sauce. I also realized I had no bread crumbs or bread so I used a seafood breading/powder. I fried them in coconut oil. They were great and my 2year old even loved them! I guess this recipe just needs to be tweaked to your own liking :)

I will admit only made this to use up cans of salmon I had, did not expect to like it. So many possibilities for future uses and my  picky 6 loved it! I will make this again loved how simple this recipe was.

I grew up eating salmon patties served for breakfast with grits. I add an egg, flour, diced onion and bell pepper (red or green) garlic powder, pepper, old bay seasoning,  and a dash of salt for seasoning. Sometimes I make salmon patties or scrambled salmon, both are delicious!

there are many varations to this recipe. I added basil onion and salt and pepper with mine. I served it with mashed potatoes and gravy with lemon juice as a side. Also making it with tuna is a great substatute.

This is how I grew up eating them except my dad would add diced onions. I have baked them but they are so much better fried. Add purple hull pea juice and fresh sliced tomatoes and this is a meal fit for a country king.

Amazingly easy -- and the whole family liked it. I did add a few drops of Worcestershire sauce, onion powder, and a rib of finely chopped celery -- but I think if you don't have on hand, it can do without. I used Jiffy mix -- and rolled finished patties in Panko Crumbs. The panko added body and texture. We will definitely be making these again and again. Economical too!

Fried in coconut oil, these are awesome without any extra spices. I didn't use self-rising flour; I followed another commenter's advice and added 3/4 tsp baking powder and 1/4 tsp salt. I actually didn't use flour at all (diet preference) and they still puffed up! Cool! Because I didn't use flour, I added a glob of cream cheese to help keep them together. They were delicious but a bit dry, so I topped mine with a little more cream cheese, but they'd be great with some kind of sauce. These are so easy and versatile! Instant favorite!

I am usually one to add or subtract ingredients from a recipe, but this one is great just the way it is.  Admittedly, I added just a *dash* of garlic powder, dried parsley, black pepper and cayenne, but other than that, I did not deviate from the recipe (no onions, bell peppers, etc.) and I would imagine it doesn't even need my small additions.  I would consider this more of a salmon croquette, due to the crispyness that the flour adds.  I didn't have self-rising, so I just used cake flour with a little bit of baking powder and salt to compensate.  I also halved the recipe, using leftover salmon from dinner the night before, and still included a full egg.   I'm sure it is just as good with canned fish, which is what I normally use for salmon patties.  Thumbs up for a super simple and tasty recipe!

I was intrigued by how simple this recipe was, and yet had so many stars. I tried it out of curiosity. YUM! This is delicious. The flavor of the salmon really stands out, you don't need anything else. I omitted the egg and they cooked up fine. Give it a try!

This recipe was simple and easy to follow. If you like your food a bit on the plain side then make it as is. I added a bit of chopped onion and a bit of tarragon (maybe 1/2 tsp?) and I didn't need nearly that much oil. Also, a lot of salmon patties call for bread crumbs but the flour gives a finer texture. Overall this was a very good recipe.

This is a great traditional recipe for salmon patties. The only thing i add is a small amount of finely chopped onions, and some salt and pepper. I think if you added too much seasoning previous comments have suggested, that you'd ruin the flavor of them.

I added Cayenne pepper and some onion and absolutely loved this. So did my husband. Also, I made a sauce of mayo, relish and garlic chili sauce. These would be great with a nice lettuce and tomato salad.

They were ok - a bit rich for me, but I suspect that had more to do with the fairly low-quality fatty salmon I was using. Definitely good for knocking up a quick meal on a cold evening.

I was as hungry as a bear when I prepared this recipe so anything would have tasted good.  However these patties lack something, perhaps a little more seasoning.

I used this recipe, and the patties were way too puffy, and it needed salt and pepper badly. Use all purpose flour instead if you don't want puffy patties. And don't forget to add salt and pepper!

I didn't make any changes and they were really good. I made them again and added a 1/4 cup of mashed potatoes mix and a 1/4 cup of bread crumps with 1 egg and they were really differently good.

This is also my dad's recipe. He is also in his 70s and still cooks it.  He was the primary cook due to my mommas work hrs growing up. Great recipe and all time favorite. He cooks it and my son Cameron is 22 and still comes running. Gotta love these family faves  that we all enjoy passing down

The only changes I made was using crushed saltine cracker crumbs, some hot sauce and lemon juice to cut down the "fishy" taste. Coated with flour and fried. Thank you for sharing your Father's recipe!

I followed the recipe...no self rise flour, just regular multi use, added creole seasoning and used egg whites only, browned with olive oil.  Mmmmmm...simple and perfect.

I really liked the ease and using self-rising flour. These held together great which is my usually challenge with Salmon Patties. There was something missing in the flavor however.
I usually add a little paprika to the pattie just before slipping it into the pan so maybe next time I will do that again. Not sure if the salmon should be drained and some of the liquid added back in to obtain right mix.  Quick and easy for those fast meal nights.

I made this for the family last night. I made it just as written and it's delicious. I decided to try it simple first time so I could see what it tasted like by itself. this recipe could be easily adapted to a lot of moods by adding some different ingredients. I like the idea another reviewer had about coating them with panko crumbs. I'll probably do that next time I make this; sick will probably be soon.

I've never been a huge seafood patty/cake lover, but this was pretty good.  I like how the self-rising flour held things together and cooked up well-that was a great tip I will use again.  Personally, I think this needs more flavoring, but I can see how the simplicity could be appealing, especially if served with a nice sauce.

I thought this was a nice way to prepare salmon.  But I think it could use more spices.  We served it with a sauce of mayo and chili sauce, and that made it much better.

I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of doubling it.  I did make a mustard dill sauce to accompany the patties, but they were exceptional without it!  Other reviews that give it a bad rating are expecting to much from a simple recipe.  I am usually not a salmon fan, but I will be making these again.  Even my 10 year old, who traditionally won't eat salmon at all ate 1 1/2 of them.  I would give it 10 stars if I could, if for no other reason but it got my child to eat something different from our norm!

Pretty good recipe, very easy to make. I added Mrs. Dash and Italian seasoning to the salmon/egg/flour mix. I also made a split pea soup (using a combination of recipes I found on here) to go over top of the salmon patties.

Great, easy recipe.  My 10 year old daughter made the patties, I fried them. Check your can of salmon and be sure it's a big one -- my cans were only 6oz, so I used two cans and the patties were delicious.  Added a bit of salt and pepper into the batter. We made 8 patties with the recipe and served with some tartar sauce.  Yummy.  Thanks for a keeper :)

Great! My mom made these but used bread crumbs. I think folks back then used what they had. Thanks for sharing, they were great and I would make again. I used left over salmon that we grilled and it was yummy! Will do again.

I have always made my salmon patties like this, so did my Mom, they are great. I dont need nearly that amount of oil though to fry them. About 10 yrs ago became allergic to egg so I now make them with out the addition of an egg, the texture is a little different (softer inside) but still same great flavor.

Good not great.  I'd like to try and find a more low-fat version of this.

My family and I loved this recipe.  Simple and very tasty.  Didn't have to add anything extra-the salmon gave them plenty of flavor.
