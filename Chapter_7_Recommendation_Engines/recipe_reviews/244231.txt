Great and easy recipe, but we do this for a once in a while treat as it's not too healthy.  However, it can be even faster --since hot dogs are already cooked in the package, no need to boil them -- just poke a couple of holes in each one with a fork before you wrap them up in the dough.  Skip the step of boiling them -- they get plenty hot in the oven.

Hot Dog Mummies Haiku: "Gourmet food, it's not. But serve to younger diners? They'll scarf them down!" This recipe is as basic as it gets, and my 7-year old and her slumber party pals enjoyed helping put them together and eating them in a most kid-friendly fashion, w/ buttered green beans. Would be a cute, fast supper b4 trick-or-treating.

Super simple and kid friendly. I skipped the boiling step and just rolled up the cold hot dogs. They were perfect!

What a fun lunch with 4 of my grands, ages 7, 7, 9, and 9! They each made their own mummy with no help from me (except I did cut the crescent roll strips). I used the crescent roll baking sheet rather than the individual rolls. No need to boil hot dogs first. Just an unnecessary step.

Three and one-half stars would be more like it.  Looked like a fun and tasty recipe so tried it today using Aidell's chicken and apple sausages as those were on hand and hot dogs were not.
They come four to a package, and are pretty large.  Sauteed just a few minutes in a skillet first, then halved each one to fit the crescent roll.  Something wasn't quite right with the crescent rolls, as they didn't cut easily into triangles as they always have previously, plus it was not so easy to wrap as suggested.  Baked as directed but found the dough not quite done enough so next time will bake according to package directions, which is 375 for 9-12 mins.    Thank you for an interesting, fun Halloween treat.

These were really tasty! I cut the hot dogs in half and we had them for a snack before trick-or-treating. They almost completely disappeared! I will make these again next year.

I did not cook the hot dogs and just wrapped them with the crescent dough.  I would recommend letting the hot dogs come to room temperature before wrapping and baking. A few of the hot dogs were a little cool in the middle.

My six year old son helped to make it as well. It turned out very nicely. Please note that the recipe called for eyes that are mustard, where the pic has sugar eyes. If you like that look, pick up some eyeballs at the store as well as the rest. It was a hit at dinner. What the boys and myself didn't finish my husband did! I would do this again next year for sure.

Sooo cute and sooo yummy!! A Halloween tradition! If using the candy eye balls, make sure to add them after baking. Mine melted the first time, which I guess you could say made them spooky gooey! LOL

Super good! My whole family loved it. My little brother loved them the most. I recommend making these. Didn’t have any premade croissants so used pizza dough, works just as well!

I left a great review earlier and realized I forgot that I didn’t boil the hot dogs. They are “cooked” so I just popped (8) them into the microwave for 1 minute to start them warming up. The 10 minutes at 350 worked great. Super simple recipe. The kids loved them.

Super easy and quick. Not the healthiest, but there weren’t any leftovers even with my picky eater. I will definitely make this again next Halloween and maybe a couple of  times in between!

Super cute! We found they just needed a couple of extra minutes in the oven to brown up, but delish! Very funny to put them in kids lunches on Halloween!

These were a fun time to make with my kiddo. I always appreciate recipes that he can be amused and excited about. My mom got a laugh out of them as well. By the last hot dog we were making zombies and vampires as well!

I liked this recipe. It is a cute idea for a Halloween party. I ended up making this for some of my friends. They enjoyed them.  I did make some changes. I used polish dogs instead of traditional hot dogs. I don't really care for hot dogs, and I thought that polish dogs worked just as well. I did end up cutting them in half as Polish dogs are a little longer than normal hot dogs. I did have to cook them longer than the recipe said. Mine took about 18 minutes or so to cook in the oven.
The only thing I did not like about this is that it was kind of salty. Crescent dough is a little salty anyways, but then mixing it with hot dogs/polish dogs made it even saltier. 
But overall, cute recipe.

Very easy.  The kids made it themselves and loved it. The bottom side of the crescent roll did not cook as much as the top. We are talking about ways to rehab the recipe into something more healthy.

My son does not like hot dogs at all but my daughter and husband loved them. I added Velveeta slices (only sliced cheese my daughter eats) in the middle and cut the corners when I pulled them to make the eyes. My daughter does not like boiled so put the dogs in the micro.
