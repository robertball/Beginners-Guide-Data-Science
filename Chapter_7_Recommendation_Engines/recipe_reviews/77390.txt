This was really good. I did not like the idea of using water...even though it called for condensed milk, so I used half evaporated milk and half 1%.  I doubled the recipe to fit a 9x13 inch pan.  The rum sauce is definitely a must.

The recipe calls for too much water. 2 cups of water will do. It was pretty decent. I added marshmallow on top instead of the rum sauce to save some calories. It made the house smell very sweet:)

This is a very good recipe!  I made it last week and followed the recipe - it was very good but also very "wet."  I did cook it a bit longer to dry it out a little.  

This time I left out one of the cups of water and it was perfect.  I am giving it 4 starts because it is very good but because of the additional water stated it needs a bit of tweeking.  It was a HIT at work.

Way too wet, even after cooking an additional 30 minutes.  Use only two cups of water... it tastes great!!!

Great recipe -- I divided the sauce and put rum extract in half (for those who don't like rum and for the kids)then poured it over the bread pudding.  I doubled the recipe thinking I'd have some left over - no such luck -- I'll definately make it again!!

Definately LESS WATER!!! I doubled the recipe, then only added 4 cups and it turned out great! Make sure you watch it for cooking time, mine took a little longer then I expected, even after adding time because it was doubled. It should look slightty wet with the edges brown. I also used reduced-carb bread and egg substitute and it was yummy!

I gave this recipe 4 stars and have not tried it as written.  I made the following changes and would give it 5+ stars:

I doubled the recipe and put it in an 9 x13 pan.  I used frozen blueberry muffins for the bread.  I ommitted 2 cups of water (used 4 total).  After mixing the wet ingredients I did not use 2 cups of the mixture as it appeared that it would be too wet.

The rum sauce was spectacular the way it states.

This recipe is so easy and turns out very good.We are not into the rum sauce though. I used the vanilla sauce recipe and added a little cinnamon to it for more flovor
