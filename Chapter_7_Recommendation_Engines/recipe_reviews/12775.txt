I really think the 1 tablespoon of salt is a misprint.  I've used this recipe for years mincing the garlic with 1 teaspoon of salt and with that small change the recipe is a five star-er.  Actually, a couple changes.  I buy fresh frozen shrimp (split and deveined but NOT peeled) and thaw them in salted water (brine).  Scientifically, this causes the protein in the shrimp to bind with the water and plumps them up.  Leaving the shells on protects the delicate shrimp from the high heat of the grill and although it's a little work for your guests to peel their shrimp, it's finger lickin' good!

The spices were just right for this recipe.  It had a really good flavor.  I did leave the shrimp in the garlic, salt, spice mixture to marinade for awhile and then I added the lemon juice shortly before cooking (if seafood is left in an acid for too long it can get mushy).  Furthermore, I used my George Forman grill to cook the shrimp; it is winter and I was too lazy to stand in the garage with the regular grill.  It only took about 2 minutes for the shrimp to cook.   through.

Very delicious and easy recipe. 
I made a few departures from the original. First, I did not put any caynne pepper (didn't have any at the time); then I added 1/2 tbsp salt, not a full tbsp. I minced 3 cloves of garlic instead of one and added an extra tbsp of olive oil. The proportions of the rest of the ingredients remained unchanged.
The sauce was enough for 1 pound of shrimp, the salt and spice were just right. 
I cooked my shrimp in a broiler for 3 min on a foil covered lightly with cooking spray.

The SALT issue...
1 tbsp coarse salt is NOT a typo.
There is a big difference between COARSE salt and REGULAR salt.  1 tbsp coarse salt would be equivalent to 1 tsp regular table salt. The recipe calls for coarse salt and if you choose to use table salt, it's up to you to know the difference in the two and not assume that the poster made an error.

Ive made this several times and have discovered that I need to watch my times very closly.  Setting too long in the salty mixture can ruin it. 
I have passed this along to friends, who all enjoy it very much.  
I usually serve 4 shrimp on top of a 4oz. piece of peppered and grilled buffalo top sirloin, roasted rosemary potatoes and a crisp cold mixed salad.

Great flavor. I cut down the salt to 1 tsp. and added 1 tsp. of Old Bay Seasoning (because I can't imaging shrimp without it). Make sure you don't overcook!

I used less salt and more cayenne.  I then prepared 2 batches - I wrapped half the shrimp in bacon before I skewered them.  Both were good, but the bacon wrapped were THE hit!

I cut the salt in half like everyone else.  This is spicy, but not as much as you'd think for there being 1/2 tsp of cayenne in it.  My shrimp ended up sitting in the garlic/pepper mixture for an hour b/c I wasn't ready to cook them....I was worried it would make it too spicy, it didn't....they were great.

Excellent!  Lots of zip!  Works great with lime also, for a different twist when you're up for a change.

This was a quick and easy recipe, great for seafood lovers such as myself :) The only thing I did different, was I used a 1 whole fresh lemon, squeezed, rather than lemon juice. It made more of a sauce that I could pour over white rice with the shrimp. My fiance loved it.

I've made these many times; it's simply the best grilled shrimp dish I've ever had, including those at high-end restaurants.  As Barbara43 said, the COARSE salt (1 tbsp) is not a typographical error, but to use that much FINE salt might ruin the dish.  (I always use shell-on shrimp, though, and I'm sure that makes a difference in final saltiness scale.). Both the garlic and cayenne pepper amounts may be increased, according to your particular tastes... I do; they just make the shrimp "yummier", in my opinion.  I always grill these in a seafood basket for for both ease and more product consistency.  As others have said, do not overlook your shrimp!

My shrimp wasn't spicy because we don't do cayenne in our house, but this simple lemon and oil seasoning was just right and not imposing, allowing the delicate flavor of the shrimp to shine. The paprika gave it great color.  We grilled the shrimp on bamboo skewers on the charcoal grill and served it over a bed of baby arugula and "Rosemary Rice," also from this site.

It may be because I left the shrimp in the sauce for around 20 minutes before cooking, but these were way too salty. (And I love salty food.) I love the rest of the flavors, though.

Made this for Mother's Day BBQ.  What a hit!!  I couldn't get them off the grill fast enough!  I made exactly as is, only in a larger quantity (4lbs and split into 2 bags).  I mixed everything right into ziploc bags and threw the shrimp in and let them marinate all day.  I don't like spicy and this was perfect..a small kick to them.  Thank you Suz....this is permanently in my recipe box!

This recipe was delicious! A little spicy for my 2 and 3 year olds, but the rest of the family enjoyed it! We grilled ours on skewers with some yellow onions, pineapple, zucchini, red and green bell peppers and then served over brown rice! We'll be making this a regular meal in our house now for sure!  We also defrosted our frozen shrimp in salt water so we reduced the salt to 1 teaspoon.

Really easy, simple and full of taste. If you like spicy you can increase the paprika. What I loved the most was the ingredients (you have everything in your kitchen). As another reviewer suggested I held back the lemon juice from the marinade ( I marinated for 2hrs) and added it 20min before grilling. Will definitely make it again.

Great recipe overall! I used 1/2 the amount of salt and added a 'splash' more lemon juice and an extra tablespoon of olive oil. Since it is way toooo cold out to BBQ I broiled for 4 minutes. While broiling I put foil down on a cookie sheet and poured the excess mix on top of the shrimp while cooking. Turned out GREAT! I served with rice!

I doubled this for 4 pounds of frozen, cooked shrimp, and let the shrimp marinate for a few hours. We put the shrimp on short skewers, and grilled them  for appetizers at a pool party for a group of older teens. They loved the shrimp...it was a great hit.   I  added extra olive oil so it wasn't actually a paste.

Really yummy! I've made it twice now, one time using the instructed amount of salt, the second time taking hints from other posts and using only 1 teaspoon, and wow did that make a difference. The 1 tablespoon is way too much!

Great combo tossed with pasta!!!  the  flavors reminded me  of spicy asian food.  Don't over do the lemon juice!! I would imagine a little honey or coconut  wouldn't be bad at all. (but not both)
The Brand; 'Coco Real' Cream of Coconut.

*at the restaurant we used the Coco Real with  crushed red pepper flakes and grilled the shrimp, thats all and it taste so good.*

This was really good but I will suggest cutting back on the salt or losing it altogether. I didn't use any and doubled the cayenne and they turned out perfect. The only reason I am giving a 4 instead of 5 is because they were flavorful enough and a tablespoon of salt would have ruined them. I made another shrimp recipe on this site the same night I made this recipe and we devoured both because they were so good. Oh, and I did end up using the broiler as the submitter suggested but I am looking forward to doing them again on the grill.

By far the best shrimp recipe ever.  I made this 3 times since finding this recipe, and I'm reminded every time how YUMMY it is. 

Unfortunately I haven't had the chance to try it on a BBQ, will do so this weekend. But if you spread the shrimp out on foil lined (no cleanup!) baking sheet on the top rack under the broiler for 4 minutes (flip after the first 2) - it's still AWESOME!

My son who HATES spicy food loves it, and I even caught my cat stealing a piece off the plate when my back was turned.  The darned cat sat there and gave us the "I'm starving to death" stare the whole time we at dinner.

Excellent recipe and very quick.  I didn't have Cayenne Pepper so I just substitued dry red pepper and it came out amazing.  I also pan fried this and used the extra sauce to pour over the shrip and wild rice.

I used 1 tsp sea salt + 1 tsp old bay seasoning INSTEAD of 1 Tbl salt.  The shrimp were spicy & delicious! I grilled some veggies, added a slice of fresh sourdough bread and couldn't stop eating!

I put all the ingredients in a mini food processor and it came out perfect.  Thanks to my husband's perfect grilling technique (top rack, lid closed), this dish was the hit of our friend's BBQ.  The shrimp was moist and had just the right amount of heat for everyone.

Made this tonight for dinner exactly as is.  Wow was this good.  I only rated it 4 stars because of the salt. Next time I would use half the amount of salt.  We will be making this again...

I was looking for a new recipe for Chicken and this was the recipe of the day.  Looked interesting so I tried it with Chicken and it was great, we all loved it.  Spicy but not too much.  We grilled bite size pieces of tenderloins, skewered.  1 tsp of sea salt was good.

This is a very good and simple recipe for shrimp. I'm pretty sure the amount of coarse salt called for is to aid in crushing the garlic into a paste. The abrasive sharp edges of the salt help grind it up (thank you FoodNetwork), and I've never had to actually use a whole tablespoon. If you skip the grinding part and just mince the garlic, you could just add salt to taste.

Absolutely AMAZING!  This is my standard shrimp recipe for the grill.  We make this at least once a week and it never fails us.  I never add the salt the recipe calls for since I feel shrimp have enough of their own natural salt flavor.  I also add more garlic than it calls for (personal preference) but this is a NO FAIL AMAZING shrimp dish!  Thanks for sharing!

I expected more of this recipe given the rave reviews. I found that the only real defined flavor in this one was the pepper and paprika. I made it exactly as the recipe stated. I suspect that those who found it too salty are using table salt rather than coarse salt. Still looking for that perfect grilled shrimp recipe!

This mix of spices is totally awesome when applied to the shrimp and skewered on the gril. I have made these multiple times and they always turn out great.

I marinated the shrimp for a couple of hours and used an indoor grill. They came out great! I served them with rice pilaf and broccoli. A really delicious, light, healthy meal. Thanks!

This is a great and easy recipe for shrimp. I usually make as is but double the cayenne and add some pepper flakes as we love heat in our food. I use fresh shrimp and let marinate for an hour or two before throwing them on the grill. When I don't have lemon on hand I have used lime with the same great results.

These were pretty tasty!  I opted to use lime and chopped cilantro opposed to using lemon.  I think if you use Shrimp, or large Prawns which we used, and they are still in the shell, the salt amount is fine as you tend to just peal it off anyways!  Licking your fingers as you go!

These were great, and my husband was just in heaven after working out of town, eating restaurant food for 2 weeks!

I served with additional limes and cilantro, Basmati Rice, and a marinated veggie salad...Yumm!

(Sorry this pic was taken on my cell phone as my camera had run out of battery power)...typical!

It is too salty. Would probably work with about half the coarse salt. As my 10 yr old daughter put it, "it has a good bite, but the salt is competing with the spices." We want to try this recipe again but will use about 1/2 tbsp coarse salt.

Great Flavor.  Not too spicy.  I followed the advice of only 1 tsp salt, and let them soak for a few minutes in the marinage (minus the lemon juice)... and added the lemon just before cooking.

I thought these were very good.  I cut down the salt, but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter.  I like my food spicy, and thought these could use a bit more kick, but the husband and I still enjoyed these.

Seriously TOO MUCH salt! Great mix of flavors but definitely cut salt down to 1 TEASPOON. If you don't like spice, cut the cayenne down, too. I use the Foreman and I have dinner in 20 minutes. Kids love it, too! Delicious (once you cut down the salt)!

This is a quick and delicious marinade that my family really likes!  I have made this several times and it's great to throw together in a few minutes before grilling.  My only change was to cut back on the cayenne because of the kids.

Notice that the recipe calls for coarse salt; if you use regular table salt it will be too salty.  That being said, I still cut down on the salt even though I used coarse sea salt because we don't like things too salty.  I used three cloves of garlic, ground chipotle pepper instead of cayenne, a Tablespoon of tomato paste from a tube, and a bit more olive oil and lemon to thin the tomato paste.  I allowed the shrimp to marinate for about 30 minutes.  Shrimp do not take long to cook on the grill and they are done as soon as they turn pink.  Great recipe!

This is an outstanding recipe.  Tried it on friends for Super Bowl.  Note, these are spicey hot so careful with the cayenne! Full recipe will please only a few in a group.  I am making more as I type this.  Whew! they are good.

Loved this great recipe.  Put shrimp in zip lock bag with sauce for 1 hour in fridge.  Added a little ginger as well.  Fried up quick and easy in skillet on stove.  Great, fast, and easy recipe.  Will be making this whenever we have company.

These were wonderful!  After peeling my 2 lbs of shrimp, they weighed much less, so I cut the ingredients in half and was SO glad I did (especially the salt amount).  I used just a pinch of cayenne, just as a personal preference (I don't like spicy).  I just mixed up all the ingredients in a small dish, then dumped it in a frying pan.  After heating it up, I added the shrimp (mine were large), and cooked them just a few minutes.  Awesome!  I served this with rice and "Sesame Parmesan Zucchini" from this site.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used smoked paprike for some extra zest.  Easy and delicious recipe.  Butterfly the shrimp for some extra-nice presentation.  I sometimes substitute the grill with the broiler depending on the weather, it's tasty either way.

i didn't have coarse salt so i used 1 tsp. table salt, it was still just a bit too salty- but i don't cook with salt and don't salt food after, so i'm sensitive to the taste. it was spicy, good amount, not too much or too little. i put the shrimp on skewers to turn easier since i made a lot and didn't want to over cook. i'd like to try the variations next, like lime instead of lemon juice. a good easy recipe.

We normally don’t use a lot of salt so we thought the salt was excessive.  And yes, I did use coarse salt.  If we had used less salt than indicated in the recipe, it would been a five star recipe.

This is now my "go to" grilled shrimp recipe.  I made the follow few changes:
Only used 1 pound of shrimp, kept all other amounts the same.  
Used 1 tsp garlic salt in place of the crushed garlic and coarse salt called for in the original version.

Perfect!

We seasoned the shrimp with this mix, then pretty much immediately sauteed them without marinating.  They were great, and my boyfriend especially loved the spice.  Since we only cooked a pound we were pretty greedy with them.  I saved a bit for the next day and I think they're even better cold.  I do wonder what kind of dipping sauce might work for these..maybe a cool sour cream dip to offset the spicy flavors?

I dont know how people say this is a good recipe.  Way too salty, only used 1/4  teas salt, would have been better with out the paprika. I will stick with my own recipe.

This was fabulous! I used the exact ingredients, marinated in everything EXCEPT the lemon for 6 hours then added lemon in the last 30 minutes. The color was beautiful and the taste was a perfect flavorful combination of moderately spicy and a little bit sweet. Excellent!

We loved this recipe.  It was so easy. I marinated the shrimp and also some chicken for about 2 hours, then grilled them on skewers with onions, peppers,and tomato.  I highly recommend this recipe.  Happy Cooking!!

Excellent!  Used pre-cooked shrimp, leaving them in the paste for a couple hours before grilling 1+ min/side.  Served with a pouch of Uncle Ben's 90sec brown rice & steamed asparagus for a quick, healthy and delicious meal.

Another great recipe - I only give 5 stars for the ultimate recipe, but this is really close - easy, fast and delicious.  I converted the recipe to serve 2 people, and as recommended reduced the salt, I also reduced the cayenne pepper slightly.  I tossed the shrimp in the marinade about 5 minutes before putting the shrimp on wooden skewers. Grilled as directed.  I served these with orzo tossed with homemade pesto.  Yum!!!

This is really good shrimp!  Definitely doesn't take long to get the flavor through the shrimp, so don't marinate too long.  I've done them on the grill and in the broiler and both came out terrific.  Difficult to get the ALL from the grill to the table -- make extra!

These where so easy to prepare, as well as eat! They had a little too much salt, but other wise, great. Instead of puting paprika, I put Cajun seasoning instead. Great with BBQ sauce for dipping!

These were really good and so fast and simple to make. I also used skewers as they are much easier to turn. Will be making them often. I only put in 1/4 tsp salt and the taste was just right for us.

One word: WOW!  I also cut down on the salt, added more cayenne and uped the garlic. I also marinated it for about  30 minutes then put them on my george foreman grill for about four minutes.  EXCELLENT!

Four and a half stars, really.  This was good and everyone enjoyed it.  However, it was not spicy (in spite of using habanero infused olive oil for 1 tblsp of the olive oil in addition to the cayenne) and we could not tell there was any garlic at all.  Using caution indicated by the reviews of others, we only used a teaspoon (not tablespoon) of salt.  We did peel (leaving the tail intact), devein and butterfly the shrimp.  They were perfectly tasty, just not the flavor indicated by the title.

I give this a five star rating although I, like others, reduced the salt to 1 teaspoon.  I let the shrimp marinate for about an hour before grilling.  Everyone thought the shrimp were perfect.  The simplest recipes are often the best.

This was wonderful, I will make this again! Followed exactly except only used 1 tsp salt. Perfect. I marinated longer than 30 min w/o the lemon juice, then added it and marinated for additional 30 min. DH loved it, we had no leftovers! be sure to use raw shrimp and do not overcook! Awesome!

Delicious! We thoroughly enjoyed the dish. We prepared it as stated and thought it was too salty. Next time, we'll cut it in half. The spiciness was just right though. This recipe is a keeper!

Perfect! This was some of the best shrimp I've had in a while and so easy to make! Made them in the broiler about 6 mins per side. I love heat so the spice was just fine for us, BUT if you don't care too much for spicy foods or are feeding young children, I would highly suggest bringing the red pepper down a notch. Also I cut the salt in half as suggested by other reviewers and it was plenty salty even w/ this adjustment! Thanks for a great dinner recipe!

I tried these yesterday and made the recommended changes: more garlic, less salt. They turned out pretty good. Would have been superb if I could have used a grill instead of broiling them. Still, healthy and tasty.

I really liked these, and easy!  I used the broiler, I think if they had been done out on the bbq I would have thought them a 5 star.

This recipe is excellent!  I thought it was salty like many of the reviewers said.  I used 1 tablespoon of extra course like the kind you get for salt grinders and mixed everthing in my morter and pestle I think I would cut the salt in half next time.  I'm still rating it 5 stars because I really think this recipe is that good.  Even with it being salty we still ate them all.  They are also great cold left overs or on a salad.

We made these for valentine's day to go with our steak and they were awesome, my dad can't go one day without saying we should buy some shrimp and make some more. The only adjustment we think is necessary is maybe decrease the salt by a teaspoon or so.

Absolutely wonderful. Add just a bit more spice than is called for because we like our food to have a bite, but other than that we cook it exactly as recommended.

If it's not spicy enough for you, try doubling the marinade. I only made 1 pound of shrimp, so I did not need to double the recipe. I tried it with 1 Tablespoon of salt and it was WAY TOO SALTY. So I used 1 teaspoon of salt instead of 1 Tablespoon and added 1 teaspoon of Old Bay seasoning (any cajun seasoning will work or omit if you don't have any). If you want it spicier, add a pinch more cayenne pepper.

Of course, ratings are from personal preference. Some would give this a 5 star. I made this exactly as per the recipe the first time, and found it lacking a bit in the "sweet" department and WAY too salty.
The next time I made it, I upped the Honey and Orange Juice by a TBS, added a splash of cider vinegar, and cut out the salt. It was PERFECT! Thank you very much for this recipe!

Wonderful Flavor!!!  The shrimp have a great kick.  I will always use this recipe when I grill shrimp.  I also left the shell on and the were moist and not dried out.  Be sure to use less salt though.  The amount of salt over powered the shrimp.

Made this dish for the second time this weekend for a party of 12 20-somethings. They all loved it! The only change I made was doubling the amount of garlic..it really cut down on the shrimpy smell & added a bit of kick. Thanks for posting it!

Very good, very spicy.  Use wooden skewers, pre-soaked 20 minutes in water, for easier handling at the grill.  I have found that I prefer fresh lime juice in lieu of the lemon juice.

I thought this was an excellent and really easy shrimp receipe.  Like others I only used 1t of salt instead of a Tablespoon. I also doubled the garlic, and I used lime instead of lemon.  I added 1 teaspoon of crushed red chili flakes for an extra kick as I like things pretty spicy.  I sprinkled these with more lime and added cilantro in the end.  YUMMY!!!

I used bay seasoning as suggested (a heaping teaspoon) and reduced the salt to about a teaspoon.  Let the shrimp sit for half an hour in the marinade.  On my indoor grill, it took more like 5-6 minutes to get thr shrimp done.

I do the same thing only I use the Crab boil by Zatarain's - Just a light sprinkle of the powder before you set it on the grill and it is the same great flavor and so easy to do.  If you want it hotter, then use a bit more sprinkle.  It's the perfect combination

This is so fast, simple and delicious! I didn't have cayenne pepper so I used a few drops of Franks red hot sauce. It was amazing. Will definitely keep this one.

So good! It does have some kick - cut down the cayenne if you don't like spicy, but don't be afraid of it because it works with this dish. Next time I will use this shrimp recipe to build a Po-boy.

Great recipe! I agree with others that the 1 Tbsp salt must have been a miss print. I make it with 1 tsp. salt. The first time I made it my husband came home late from work so the shrimp sat in the 'paste' for an hour resulting in some very spicy shrimp. Tonight we are trying to add one more clove of garlic (we like garlic :) ) and only let it sit for about 5 mins. 1 hour or 5 mins this recipe is delish! {Oh and we cooked in in a small amount of butter on the stove in a medium sized skillet}

Love this. I didn't use as much salt, added more Cayenne and threw in a dash of Sesame Seed Oil for a nutty flavor. Skewered them and thru them on the B-B-Q. Then off they went into a salad with avacado, beets, tomato and Feta. so good!

Loved this!  We used fresh caught jumbo shrimp, skewered them and devoured every bit.  Having the skewer worked out very well and made grilling easy.  Will be a regular recipe we make on vacation where fresh seafood is REALLY fresh!

Easy and delicious.  For simplicity prep the shrimp and toss them in a big bowl then just pour all the ingredients in and stir together.  I let them all sit for 10min then skewered and grilled.

This is a great marinade but I like to make the recipe with a twist! Skewer the shrimp with freshly cut pineapple, red onion, and green bell pepper. Sprinkle with freshly chopped cilantro then a squeeze of fresh lemon juice right when you throw the skewers on the grill. The sweetness of the pineapple marries very well with the spiciness of the shrimp!

I'd give it 5 stars but there was too much salt (for most people). I love salt ;) and loved the recipe as is but hubby and kids requested less salt next time. 

I'd like it with more cayenne to be Fiery...so at least 1 teaspoon next time although my kids liked the fieriness as the recipe indicated.

Thanks for the simple and fast recipe!

I made this tonight for dinner and it was a big hit with hubby and kids. Made exactly according to recipe (using the Tblsp of COARSE salt) and felt it was great. All agreed it was a keeper. I served with the easy arugala salad also from this site and had a delicious healthy meal that the whole family enjoyed.

Delicious! Based on comments I reduced the salt to 1 tsp of coarse Kosher salt. I used 3 cloves of garlic, crushed through a garlic press. Also per recommendations, I held off on the lemon and let the shrimp marinade in the refrigerator for an hour. 10 minutes before grilling, I added the lemon juice and tossed them. This isn't spicy at all and has a wonderful flavor.

The recipe was great but next time I'll use half the salt or even a fourth.  It's bordering on indelible with two tablespoons.

I followed the recipe exactly and as others had suggested - I marinated in all the spices and then just before grilling I added the lime juice.  I grilled them on a grill pan and served them room temp as an appetizer with cocktail sauce and an aioli for dips.  Very good!

Like others said: use half the salt. I used three cloves of garlic, added extra cayenne and paprika and a tiny bit of cumin and chili powder. Lime instead of lemon juice. Delicious.

I personally hate shrimp but my fiance loves this dish. It's fast and easy, just the way I like to cook. Especially because half of the things a recipe calls for, I have never heard of in my life. I strongly recommend this dish.

These were delicious! I prepared this for lunch with a salad and my husband raved! I followed the recipe just adding a pinch of cayenne (we don't like too spicy) and a pinch of salt - otherwise did not change a thing. Absolutely delicious! Will be making again very soon!

Cut the ingredients in half due to the amount of shrimp I was preparing for the two of us. Way too much salt!  I believe it would work with 1 tsp verses 1 tbsp of course salt.  Otherwise the taste was good and I will try it again with these revisions.

Great recipe for the grill! I made these the first time and they were the smash hit of the BBQ. I left the shells on (they peel even easier after cooking) and put them on skewers. We couldn't cook them fast enough.

So good!  Only used 1 tsp salt and only 1 lb of shrimp.  Baked the shrimp for about 10 minutes at 425 degrees with the shells on.  Could eat this every week!!

This was killer!  I cut back on the salt like everyone else but followed the recipe otherwise and it was the perfect amount of spicy.  Grillmaster husband did a fabulous job cooking them and this will be a favorite way to cook shrimp.  Hope there are lots more sales on extra large shrimp in our area!  We ate a LOT!

I was looking for a simply and fast way to cook up some shrimp and I found my go-to recipe! I served this for our Easter get together yesterday and everyone came back for 4ths and 5ths! The only changes I made to the recipe were: I used 3/4 tbsp. of regular iodized salt and I made two batches of the 'sauce/marinade'. I used the amount it lists out for 4 pounds of shrimp for TWO so there'd be even more kick. We like spicy foods. It worked out great, thanks so much!

We made this on vacation at the beach (paired w/ some spiced salmon) and it was a huge hit.  The ingredients joined well to form a paste which covered the shrimp well. I used chili powder.  My only regret...not getting more fresh shrimp!

I made this for a cocktail party as an appetizer.  I was still working the grill when my wife informed me that all four pounds of shrimp were gone.  From what I've heard they were fantastic and I can guarantee you that my guests raved about them.  Even my kids asked if I could make it again because they didn't get enough.  Other than changing the salt to 1/2 T, I didn't change a thing.  Good luck and enjoy!  I wish I got to.

I made the marinade with 1 tsp. salt, but exactly the same otherwise.  Marinated for about 10 min. & tossed them into "Creamy Chorizo & Chicken Soup" (shrimp instead of chicken)  They were stellar!!  Juicy & very flavorful for only cooking in the soup for a few minutes & they made the soup unbelievable, can't wait to make it for friends!  Just what I was looking for!  Can't wait to try them on the grill, Thanks for the recipe! :o)  *UPDATE*  grilled em'! LOVED EM'!!!  will use this recipe often!

OUTSTANDING -- and so crazy simple!  I even forgot to buy garlic and had to substitute powder, and it was still incredible.  Almost identical to my favorite shrimp at a Crowne Plaza hotel in Houston.  Thank you so much for sharing -- I'll be making it all summer!

Awesome! I scaled the recipe to 1 lb of shrimp and I used shrimp that was already fully cooked then just put it in a hot skillet to heat it through. I used extra cayenne, it was REALLY spicy but me and my husband could not get enough. He and I ate 1 lb of shrimp in one sitting! This recipe made it into my favorites cookbook.

These shrimp are the best! Cut way back on the salt though. I have made them as written, and they are way too salty. I use 3/4 of a teaspoon and it's just right. I make them in the George Foreman grill, or on top of the stove with a grill pan. Either way, my family and friends devour them. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

This was great. I added lime, as someone else suggested, and broiled the shrimp. Definitely a quick weeknight keeper.

This recipe was wonderful!  I kept asking my husband, "Now, just how much do you like this???!!??"  We ate the whole bowl.  I served it over egg noodles.  I also added a little worcheshire (sp?) sauce.  Very, very good!

these were so great-- tasty, perfectly spiced and SO easy. i wish i liked shrimp more because i'd make this all the time.

i did cut down on the salt and add more cayenne. 

i've also adapted this to make a kind of shrimp scampi, making a bit more of the sauce to mix in with angel hair pasta. i am going to try the same marinade on other meats, that's how much i love it!

These were very good and so easy! I marinated the shrimp in a ziploc in the fridge for an hour, then added the lemon juice and I also added Old Bay Seasoning. Delicious !!

This recipe was great.  I followed the recipe to a T and wouldn't change a thing about it, it had wonderful spice, but wasn't too hot and the perfect amount of lemon flavor came through.  I marinaded the shrimp for about 15 minutes before cooking and used an indoor grill pan.  The only thing I'll do different next time is make more!! Thanks for the keeper!

Delicious!  Followed the advice of other reviewers and cut down on the salt and these came out just perfect.  Will most likely make this again.  Tastes even better with a sauce that you pour over consisting of hot sauce, butter, and garlic.

This recipe was the hit of the party!!!!  My guests were begging for more!  I thought it was delicious.  I marinated the shrimp and the vegetables (in different zip lock bags) for a couple hours before I grilled them.  The meal was outstanding and I will definitely make it again!

This was very easy and very good.  I used lime juice because I didn't have any lemons, and I added a dash of Old Bay.  My favorite grilled shrimp recipe is still "Grilled Marinated Shrimp" from this site, but I will likely make this again as well.  Warning, it is pretty spicy as written, which we liked, but if you like milder things, cut back on the cayenne!

Great recipe!  I am drooling thinking about it.  My husband and I usually leave this recipe for our camping trips.  We usually put the shrimp and all of the ingredients into an aluminum foil package to cook on the campfire.  These are always tremendously good.  I love the garlic and the Cajun spices.

YUM!  so fast, so easy, and SO delicious!  Only change I made was to cut some of the salt.  I accidently added 2 tsp instead of 1 tsp as recommended, and it was too much.  1 tsp should be perfect.  Can't wait to have again!!!

Fantastic ! I always marinate my raw shrimp in 2 TBS sugar and 2 TBS kosher salt and then refrigerate for two hours. Rinse the shrimp in cold water and then I used this recipe. I did cut my salt in half and it was perfect !!! I didn't think it was too spicy at all, my family loved it. By the way, marinating the shrimp in salt and sugar makes the shrimp tender and adds flavor. This is a great recipe.

Very good.  I prepared the recipe as directed.  I made these shrimp for a southwestern salad- lettuce, grilled corn, black beans, tomatoes, tortilla chips, cilantro lime dressing. Wonderful.

This is excellent.  Very short prep time, just spicy enough to be tasty and not overwhelming.  A keeper!!

Eye-balled the salt, broiled on skewers, served with red beans and rice.  Absolute success!  Loved it, as did hubby!

A great addition to my BBQ repertoire. I go a bit easy on the salt, though. I'm sure this recipe would taste just as good with chicken as it does with shrimp.

REALLY delicious! I made these last week, followed the recipe exactly, although I did add a dash of dried basil. I skewered (used 2 skewers side-by-side for each batch I cooked so it would be easier to flip them) and grilled them. Very spicy, such a great flavor. I served with parmesan angel hair pasta and steamed fresh broccoli spears.

I really liked this recipe!  It was too spicy for the kids, but my husband and I thought it was perfect.  So easy, too!  It's definitely going into heavy rotation.

This was Excellent with a few tweaks, thanks previous reviewers! Doubled the garlic (I just finely chop mine with the salt), 1 tsp of salt, 1 TSP just sounded like it would be way too much, then I did half paprika and half old bay. Also added 1 tsp of pickapeppa sauce for that extra little sweet/spicy kick you can only get from pickapeppa. Marinated for about half hour or so while the rice was cooking. Went great with the rice also cooked with some pickapeppa in the water.

Oooohhhh Doggy - I keep making this and making this.  I catered the garlic to taste as well as the pepper.  My Summer BBQ friends love this recipe.  I have handed it out too many times to count.  Serve with great Cab or a Pinot to bring out the true taste.

It was good, but not as good as I expected.  I wanted a bit more kick to it.  I think I'll add a cayenne sauce to the marinade.

This was excellent! We made it as an appetizer and it was a huge hit. A little spicy, so next time I will make it I will add a little less cayane pepper, but other then that it was great! I will definately make this again!

Very good!  I used pre-frozen shrimp, which was a mistake.  I'll use fresh shrimp next time...  I also cooked them in my counter-top rotisserie, since it is winter.  Still turned out great!

This is a great quick way to spice up grilled shrimp.  It may be a little spicy for kids, though, depending on how much cayenne you use, or the type of cayenne that you have.  But it is YUMMY!

This is one of my favorite recipes. I have made it many times and have given the recipe out quite a few times. I have always made it exactly like it is posted because it is perfect. The only difference is that I do not use it for shrimp. I use it on salmon. I spoon on a generous amount and completely cover each piece of salmon before I put it on the grill or in the oven or in a frying pan. It is delicious! The salmon turns out crispy on the outside and flaky on the inside with that luscious bit of spiciness and it is wonderful. Guests have raved about my grilled salmon. This recipe makes me look good. Thank you!

I have made this twice so far and love this recipe! For those of you saying it is too salty, did you use COARSE salt like the recipe stated? 1 T of coarse salt only equals 1/2 T table salt. The first time I made exactly as stated, except I just threw everything into a ziplock bag, and it was great. Not too salty at all. Second time I added 1 T honey and sprinkled some dried Parsley (for some color) and it made it even better. I love a little sweet with the heat. Thank you so much for this simple recipe! Best part is that I had everything on hand.

This is a GREAT recipe!
I made this for Father's Day as my father is big sea food fan, and not only did he eat it, but so did my mother, and typically she strongly dislikes all sea food. 

I DID modify the recipe a little. I chopped up a small handful of cilantro, one jalapeno pepper (with seeds), and added about 1/4tsp of habanero powder. I let the shrimp marinate all day as well, about 10 hours give or take. We also drizzled the leftover mixture on the shrimp as we grilled it. 

Highly recommend this for the shrimp lover in your life, and for the person who doesn't yet know they're a shrimp lover.

I used regular table salt for this and ruined it! It was soooo salty! I mixed everything together and used it as a marinade. I refrigerated it for two hours and it should have been great! I will use table salt again but probably 1 tsp salt.

I made this last night for dinner and OMG! This is terrific! I only used a tsp. and a half of kosher salt. One tbsp. would have been too much. I also used 3 large cloves of garlic. I am making it again tonight and we are having shrimp tacos. This one is a keeper!!!!

This recipe is delicious!  There is too much salt, however.  I would reduce it at least by half.  I also didn't grill the shrimp.  I wiped a non stick griddle with oil (just enough to coat the pan) then pan broiled the shrimp.  They came out awsome!

This was just perfect. Followed recipe exactly and it did not disappoint! I wasn't sure at first if it was enough oil but it was. I used jumbo prawns which were de-veined only and let it marinate for about two hours. Used kosher salt and didn't have any salt issues as discussed in some of the reviews. I would not change a thing and will make these again. Made them for dinner guests and they were all impressed and enjoyed the shrimp. Served with bbq mushrooms and bbq asparagus. The only downside (not recipe related) was that the guests had to peel the shells off but they didn't mind the mess.

I little spicy for our taste and may tone it down just a little next time. Used it as part of a salad and it was very good.

Wow was this salty! Will try again, since the spice combination looks good, but I will GREATLY reduce the amount of salt.  Wish I had read a few more reviews before I made this.

This was delicious and easy. I let the shrimp sit in the mixture for 5-10 minutes before grilling. I used seasoned salt instead of coarse salt and SMOKED paprika. YUM

We've made this delicious shrimp recipe a few times now without changing a thing.  It's so easy and spicy as we like it, and also so versatile; you can put over salad, in tacos, over pasta, or simply alone.  A go to recipe for sure!

I love how easy this was. Per the advise of several other reviewers I only used 1 tsp of salt. It paired well with roasted veggies and basmati rice.

This is a wonderfully easy and quick preparation for shrimp.  Thanks to all those who suggested to reduce the salt.  I used 1 tsp. coarse salt and it was perfect.  After the shrimp are coated with the paste, I also gave it a light shake of a spice blend I had on hand that includes chipotle pepper, red pepper, jalapeno, and smoke flavoring.  That gave it an additional pop of flavor in our household that likes spicy.  I used our indoor grill with bamboo skewers and it works great!  It was delicious with red beans and rice.  I will definitely make it again and again!

Great base for grilling rub! Definitely cut the salt to 1 tsp. I have so made it with my twist: use pineapple juice instead if lemon. Add 1/2 tsp of Old Bay seasoning ( I can't have seafood without it!) and depending on your love of heat, I add 1/2 a chopped Serrano pepper. My family loves it!

My husband loves salt and hot spices, I do not.  The previous ratings and reviews caught my attention when looking for a recipe to grill shrimp.  I made the recipe exactly as stated.  I was surprised that I enjoyed it, to me it was an excellent appetizer. It's original in flavor, unlike any other shrimp I've made.  My husband for several days kept mentioning that it was the best shrimp he ever ate and he would prefer it as a meal.  It's a "keeper" recipe for us. Thank you for posting!

I sure wish I had read the reviews before I made this. I followed the recipe and used the tablespoon of course salt. The flavor of the spice is fantastic and hubby loved it but it was just too salty. Next time I make this I will definately be cutting the salt way down. Other then the saltiness the flavor of this recipe is really good, just don't use a Tablespoon of salt. :-)

We make this a lot.  These are really good.  I do add 2 cloves of Garlic instead of one & leave the shell of the shrimp on. Everyone who has tried them always raves about how good they are.  Thank you for the recipe.

This was pretty good. I thought it gave good flavor but was a bit bland for the " spicy" title. I marinated my shrimp for several hours so I did not add the lemon juice till a half hour before. I will make it again but will combine with another spicy shrimp recipe that I have.

Delicious!  The only thing I did differently was sprinkling a little Lemon Pepper seasoning directly on the shrimp before grilling.  I also used regular salt, as I didn't have any coarse salt.  Very good recipe!

As SKANDREWS mentioned i also think the tablespoon of salt is a misprintThe first time i made this recipe way to much salt.The next time i prepared this recipe i used less salt and it was fantastic.

Probably the best shrimp I've ever had.  Wound up pan frying it, next time I'll do it on the grill.  Also, changed servings to 3, and used 1lb of shrimp instead of 2, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.

This is a great recipe, but I ended up really cranking up the seasoning on these - and I skewered them to make them easier to grill. After putting them on wooden skewers I had soaked for about 15 minutes, I generously sprinkled both sides with a cajun seasoning and a little sea salt. They were wonderful, but I think if I hadn't added the extra seasoning, they would have been a little bland and needed cocktail sauce.

These were really good. I didn't have paprika so I didn't add it but I did have everything else. I'm not incredibly fond of spicy but this had just the right amount of pepper. I served it with grilled zucchini and it went great together. My other loved it too so thanks for an awesome recipe- I'll definitely be using this recipe again in the future.

They turned out great!! I broiled them bc I didnt have a grill, but still they turned out great. I preheated the oil with some garlic for 2-3mins and then added the shrimps! I plan to add a little bit more lemon for the next time!

Made these ystrdy wit charcoal grill 4 Dinner with 18adults - The guests "fought" over who wud get the last 1!!! They all asking when's the next get-together so i can do shrimps 4them again! Only change was using 1/2 tsp salt per lb. (way 2salty with 1T). Next time i'll add more pepper & marinate a little longer (my preference). Great, simple recipe!

This is a great recipe. Like everyone else, I cut the amount of salt in half. I don't see how that's not a typo. Do that and the recipe is perfect. I think you can be pretty liberal about the sauce to shrimp ratio and you can't go wrong. Just the right amount of spicy, mmm!

This is a great recipe, with a couple slight modifications. First, I don't grill the shrimp, I saute it. I think it picks up more of the flavor and spice.  Second, I add about 1 T. of low sodium soy sauce. The soy sauce adds a good flavor that is otherwise lacking. I cut back severely on the "coarse salt." I only use a few sprinkles as the soy sauce has a salty taste already.  My husband and I enjoy this and serve it most often with flavored rice.

These were delicious!  I put them under the broiler for about 5 minutes and they were perfect.  Just the right amount of zing.  I will be cooking these at least once a week.

Do NOT use the full amount of salt, it is WAYYY too salty.  I would cut it in half, if not, less.  It's such a good recipe that is ruined by the saltiness, but would be delicious with less salt. (we doubled the recipe for the same amount of shrimp and it came out good).

I think the recipe is good but the amounts are a bit off; I'd double the oil and lemon and then half the cayenne and salt! :)

I made this for my boyfriend the other night. I only used 1 lb of shrimp, but I used the noted amount of spices, which meant it was pretty spicy. Totally my fault. Also, I made more like a stirfry and tossed all the shrimp in a pan, since we don't have a grill. I served it with plain white rice, which did help cool it down a bit. It was really delicious! Spicy, but tasty. I'll definitely be making this one again -- but I'll have to remember to halve all the spices. :)

I ALWAYS read the reviews before making a new recipe and in this case I completely forgot because I was rushed.  I just checked the reviews because everyone is RIGHT - it was WAY too salty.  I put some Yoshidas sauce over the shrimp to tone down the salt - but otherwise it's a good recipe and I will make again.

Excellent! The only changes I made were to omit the cayenne and paprika, substituting creole seasoning instead. I also added some parsley flakes to the marinade as well. Marinate for about 20 minutes, and the end result is very similar to the shrimp on the barbie served at the Outback Steakhouse. Serve with remoulade sauce for a winning combination!

I love this recipe. I have made it 3 times in the past 2 weeks. We went to CT for the Fourth and I made this for my in-laws and they loved it too.  The only thing I do differently is to add more garlic and to let it marinate for about 30 min to an hour. I just eyeball the ingredients and it comes out perfect every time.  I highly recommend you try this recipe! UPDATE: I used this paste mixture on some grilled veggies and it was outstanding!! This is a must try recipe!

I'm reviewing this for my BF.  I don't like shrimp so this one is all him.  He LOVED it.  He said you could really taste the lemon and then the kick of the cayenne pepper jumped in.  He gives this a 5 stars and has already asked me to make it again.  Only change I made is I used regular salt.  :)

Excellent, easy recipe. I did not have cayenne pepper so I substituted red pepper, I used only 1 tsp of salt, not the 1 tblsp that it calls for, definitley a misprint. Mixed the paste and put it on the shrimp, let it sit for about 10 min. then put it on the grill. Just the right amount of seasoning.

I love this recipe.  I never use the salt and never have paprika on hand, but all the other ingredients together make for tasty shrimp!  We use a lot of crushed red pepper because we love spicy food.  It is the easiest shrimp marinade ever.

This was pretty yummy, but I do have to admit that I was halving the recipe and forgot to halve the cayenne pepper! Wow! So it was a little too hot for my taste (and I had to rinse it off for my kids), but I can't wait to try it again when I can also taste the other spices on it. I also completely left out the salt. And next time I would probably use precooked shrimp. The peeling and deveining adds so much time that the quickness of this recipe is quickly lost in the prep time. I cooked it with pineapple chunks on the skewers, and it was a good thing I did in this case since the heat needed a little tempering. I served it with a side of brown rice and asparagus mixed with some terriyaki sauce and also added some of the pineapple and pineapple juice from the can.

This recipe is easy enough and quick, but on the bland side.  Cut back on the salt per suggestions of previous reviewers and ended up adding china blue pepper sauce to pump up the flavor.

My husband loved this recipe. I didn't get to use the grill, because of the weather, but I bet it tastes even better when grilled. Thanks for sharing!

I only used 1 tsp of salt like the other reviewers reccomended.  I also doubled the garlic and cut the cayenne pepper in half, as my husband doesn't like really spicy food.  It was PERFECT!  This is most difintely a recipe I will use again and again.  Thank you SO much!

This is the best shrimp marinade!  I've made it many times.  The ingredients are perfect as written.  We like to let it marinade in the fridge for 2-6 hours before grilling.

A quick and tasty dinner. I doubled the garlic, used 1 tsp of salt and added 1 additional tbsp of olive oil. I broiled the shrimp for 3 minutes on one side and two on the second. Delicious with basmati rice and roasted asparagus.

Easy, great flavor...did I mention easy?! It was a great shrimp dish that was easy to make with ingredients I always have on hand...a nice kick. Just served with white rice and a veggie to make a nice light meal.

Not sure I would make this again. I used a sea salt grinder and I followed the recipe with no changes at all. I thought it would have a lot more flavor than it did. I love spicy food, but this was just *spicy* there was no depth to the flavor. I couldn't even taste the minced garlic. Pretty disappointing since we used fresh caught local shrimp for this recipe. I'll keep looking, thanks

I made this recipe for my boyfriend's birthday, and he absolutely loved it!  I didn't have sea salt, so I just used regular.  Also, I doubled the marinade even though I only used a pound of shrimp for the 2 of us.

This is truly a restaurant-quality dish!  So good, and so easy.  I soaked some bamboo skewers in water for about 20 minutes then threaded the shrimp onto them.  This made grilling them a breeze.  About 3 minutes per side and they were perfect.  This is so delicious and will be part of my family's menu rotation. Thank you for posting!

Definitely cut back on the salt. Even one teaspoon was too much for our taste, it just overpowers everything. But the other flavors are really good with a nice spice.  Easy and quick.

This is my go to recipe for grilled shrimp. Absolutely delicious and highly recommended by my family. The only thing different I suggest is only using about 1/2 teaspoon salt...just simply don't need a full tablespoon! I like to leave this marinade on my shrimp in a zip-loc bag for several hours..simply delicious.

This could've been great, but I followed recipe EXACTLY which was a mistake.  Way too salty, everyone agreed and I like salty food!  Even though this could've easily been five stars I can only give it three because the recipe AS IS, calls for way too much salt.  I think a five star recipe should not have to be tweaked in a major way, like reducing 1 T of salt to 1 tsp to make it delicious.  I would make again but with 1 tsp or less of coarse salt.

Absolutely delicious, I have used medium size shrimp also, whatever is on sale, and I do not use all that salt either, I just season to taste, and I let the shrimp marinade for 30 min. But just watch the salt!!

Excellent recipe for Shrimp that tastes great, is a fast marinade and easy to make. Complete recommended with everyone on the salt. The original recipe asks for a tablespoon. I went with a teaspoon and thought that was just a little too much. I increased the cayenne pepper which was just right. During cooking, I cooked it for 2 1/2 minutes on each side and it was perfect but I think that each grill's heat pattern is different. Be careful not to over-cook the shrimp.

Not quite as good as the Thai BBQ Shrimp but still four stars for good taste, simplicity and healthy. Again, I use the pre-cooked, already peeled frozen shrimp for extra ease.

So glad I read the reviews about using less salt.  I reduced the salt to 1-tsp. and we thought it was still too salty.  Next time I won't use any salt.  A few squeezes of fresh lemon helped cut the salty taste.  I used equal amounts of paprika and cayenne and it was perfect for us.  Prep shrimp and marinade/paste the night before and you've got a really quick evening meal.

Tasty!  I added another 1/4 tsp. of cayenne, let it marinade for about 1 1/2 hrs.. Turned out great.  Note: it is for those who like spices and spicy.  Sprinkle some lemon on it too.  :)

The marinade was very easy, and went well with the shrimp. My only complaint was the spiciness, we expected it to be much spicier. Next time I'll switch the amounts of cayenne with paprika.

This is my new favorite for grilled shrimp. Because I wanted to skewer the shrimp, I basted them after I had them on the skewers instead of tossing them in the sauce beforehand, which still worked great. I'll definitely cut back on the salt next time, though.

This is one of my DH and my favorites--gives the shrimp a nice flavor, has a little kick and is perfect for the grill as the shrimp get a tiny bit crunchy on the outside.  Perfect in warm weather.  Don't serve to spice-phobes...we have one in our family who thinks pepper is too spicy so he won't eat this.  His loss--more for us!

Amazing recipe! I'm from the UK and this is a superb dish whether it's a family barbie or an entertaining barbie. The combination of spices and flavours is excellent for fresh raw tiger prawns/shrimp. I marinaded this for about 2 hours for extra zing!!

This is great. I didn't crush the garlic. Instead I used this as a marinade, adding some hot sauce and marinaded it for about 3 hours.

This was delicious. Everyone loved it. We added a bit more lemon juice than called for. We would recommend only using half of the cayenne the first time you make it. It is pretty hot. You can always add the rest the next time you make it if you want it hotter. We used the same marinade to glaze fresh pineapple and veggies that we also grilled. They were delicious, especially the pineapple.

We enjoy this recipe and I have made it a few times. The first time we thought it was too salty so I now use only 1 teaspoon of sea salt and that's  plenty. It's spicy and we like it that way. It's easy, quick and tasty.

Excellent shrimp recipe.  I used crushed garlic from a jar to save a little time. We had some left over so I diced it up and put on a salad.  Yummy

I only used 1lb of shrimp, but kept the marinade ingredients mostly the same Per others suggestions I used 1tsp salt instead of 1Tbsp, but it was still too much. I also used ground chipotle instead of red pepper flakes...I just love the smokeyness of chipotle. I will definately make these again!!!

I would actually give this 3 1/2 stars if possible.  It was pretty good, but I think it might have been better with marinating for 30 minutes or so.  But beware, they are a bit spicy like the title indicates!!

I had to double the garlic paste because it wasn't enough to cover them all. I used Old Bay which others suggested.  I didn't realy measure the Old Bay and these were realy realy spicy, but that may be why.  I made spegetti with olive oil and garlic and I steamed aspargus.  Since the shrimp were so spicy I mixed the shrimp, cut up asparagus and the spegetti together, which lessened the "heat".  I served it with sprinkled lacateli cheese and boy was it delicous.  My daughter and husband loved it too.  Great recipe.

Used OLD BAY instead of paprika like some others suggested. Also cut down on the salt.  My boyfriend LOVED it.  I made it in our hotel room in Lake George, so it was SOOOOO EASY to make.  Great recipe.  My boyfriend would have like it if I put butter in it, but he likes butter in and on everything!

OK so the issue with this recipe is that it takes a lot longer then three minutes per side. My husband cooked these on low on the BBQ, and although they were divine, it took a good 15 minutes and a lot of basting, which he loved doing, overall it was a good experience and a good appetizer, but the time was to far off to give it a 5***** :)

This made an awesome marinade from the shrimp I made the other nite. We broiled our shrimp on skewers and it was so very tasty!

Very delicious.  This was a hit with my family.  I already had the jumbo shrimp...next time I will be sure to buy peeled and deveined.  I didn't have paprika so I used a 1/2 tsp of Old Bay Seasoning instead.  Very Spicy and Yummy!!! Thanks!

We liked this recipe very much, but thought it was much too salty.  Next time I will use 1/2 the salt and more cayenne.  I doubled the recipe for 2 pounds of jumbo srimp.

Amazing taste.. this was the first meal ive ever prepared in my life and everyone had big smiles on their faces from the amazement of how good these taste... they taste like something you'd have at a restaraunt. GOOD STUFF.. make these things... watch them close though a few of mine burned on one side pretty quick.

We had company on Saturday afternoon before our son's rehearsal dinner.  I fixed the Spicy Grilled Shrimp and salad and iced tea.  What a wonderful luncheon!  I made no adjustments to the recipe and it was great.  Thanks!

I don’t mind salt but this definitely was too salty. I used only 1 tsp of Kosher salt. Also, definitely not spicy, per ingredients listed. I thankfully had some limes to neutralize the saltiness

O. M. G. this shrimp is absolutely AMAZING!! I broiled it in the oven, and I made it along with salmon, green beans, and I paired the shrimp with some linguine pasta. It was so good. I definitely recommend the shrimp with some buttered noodles. It complements the spiciness of the shrimp perfectly. Overall, absolutely delicious and would recommend to anyone!!!

Followed recipe exactly but disappointed with result. We like spicy dishes & use lots of garlic but all we could taste was garlic and heat with this one. We salvaged by being overly generous with lemon squeezes and dipping in tangy shrimp cocktail sauce. Too many other great recipes to showcase shrimp, won't make again.

This was a huge hit with the shrimp lovers.  I was afraid the cayenne would be too spicy but it was not. Made exactly as written but added 2 more cloves of garlic.  I grilled them in aluminum pans vs directly on the grill.  I had about 60 shrimp so I was not paving them on one by one. :) I’ll make it again.

We LOVED this recipe.  Delicious.  We modified it by using heaping teaspoons for the cayenne pepper. We have made it twice since July 4th and will make it again.

My only changes were: 1 tsp of salt, and I used smoked paprika. 
Great recipe!

I've never cooked shrimp before. It was so simple that i thought I must be doing something wrong. It was the best I've ever tasted. I put it on my gas grill. Everyone loved it! I forgot the lemon at the end but didn't feel like anything was missing.

I wish I'd read the reviews first. One Tbsp of coarse sea salt made it much too salty and we could taste nothing else. I would cut the salt down to one tsp next time and see if that helps.

This is amazing! So quick and easy. Better than most restaurants seaside. Just be sure that if you don’t have coarse salt, to adjust down. We used 1 tsp sea salt and it was perfect. Making this again for certain.

Yum! Quick and easy meal that's packed with lots of flavor. I added a smidge of Old Bay, a tad more cayenne though. I don't use or purchase olive oil. I prefer grape seed oil. Also I cooked them inside using my  2 burner cast iron grill/griddle which I preheated and oiled well. My hubby and I both loved this recipe.

The Bomb! I put everything, but the lemon juice in a plastic bag in the morning, and placed in the fridge for later.  Came home from work, tossed in the lemon juice, and then I went to fire up the grill.  Cooked them on the grill just until done, and they were amazing with grilled asparagus and dinner roll.  So fast and easy with very little clean up.  Thanks  for a great recipe! We will be making this again and again.

I agree that 1 tablespoon of salt seems wrong.  I used a teaspoon of salt and used Old Bay 1/2 teaspoon of Old Bay seasoning instead of the cayenne pepper.  I used a grill basket on the grill and it came out perfectly done.

I made this last night & it was way to salty!!!  I don't like to give bad reviews but shrimp aren't cheap.   I could barely eat it!  The salt cannot be 1 Tablespoon like the recipe says.  Can someone please tell me if that's correct?   Every recipe I have made from Allrecipes has been absolutely delicious & this is the 1st on that wasn't.  Please someone change the measurements to 1 teaspoon instead of 1 tablespoon so someone else doesn't ruin their expensive shrimp.

Followed the recipe as written but added a little more spice. Salt was fine, use sea salt or kosher salt, marinate for an hour or so and I put them on skewers. DE-Lish_ous!

I love spice,  shrimp, and grilling so this is a summertime favorite!!
Recipe is very easy.  I doubled the cayenne pepper, added some turmeric,  replaced lemon juice, with several drops of lemon essential oil, and garnished with fresh grilled pineapple instead of lemons.   Served over quinoa and brown rice!  OMG... sometimes think I could eat this every night!

Spicy! I used half of the cayenne pepper mentioned in the recipe and felt the shrimp was perfectly seasoned, however, my husband felt it was to spicy. I served the shrimp with a lime dill yogurt  sauce which complimented the shrimp beautifully cutting out some of the spice and adding an extra layer of flavor. Delicious!

Absolutely delicious.  Thankful that another cook pointed out it is coarse salt, I used 3/4 of a TB and it seemed just right.  Another cook suggested marinating longer  BUT putting lemon on at end since  the acid starts to break theshrimp down, I did this, too.  We had extra and will definitely use for shrimp tacos, the flavor is perfect for tacos.  We ate it with some of Trader Joe's parbaked rolls, tasted amazing nestled in the warm bread.  Would be a great appetizer, too.  Thank you!

Fast and delicious.   I cut back on the salt as recommended, and used lime instead of lemon because it's what I had on hand.  Husband said to hold onto this recipe, it's a keeper!

This wonderful recipe is by Mark Bittman and was featured in New York Times Cooking. Credit should be given when using someone else's recipe.

Loved this and so did my husband and 17 year old daughter. Just the right amount of spice from the cayenne pepper and a nice smoky flavor from the paprika. Used a fresh lemon instead of lemon juice but otherwise followed the recipe. Will definitely make again and again.

We put these on a skewer and grilled them with fresh asparagus for a fabulous and easy dinner.  It tasted like Spanish garlic shrimp (gambas al ajillo,) but with more flavor since it marinated in the rub for awhile. Pair it with a nice caesar salad and a sauvignon blanc.

I too reduced the salt to 1.5 tsp.  as it seemed excessive.

Really good!  I let the shrimp set in the spices for just a couple of minutes and they were very flavorful.

I followed this recipe except that I only had  one pound of shrimp and used two cloves of garlic (huge garlic fan.) It was a bit on the spicy side but was wonderful for me as I love spicy food. I combined all ingredients in a Ziploc bag instead of bowl. Let it rest for about 10 minutes while I waited for the grill to heat up.  Very easy and quick.

This was my first time grilling shrimp. I've always pan fried it or made shrimp cocktail.  We really enjoyed this easy recipe. I did tweak it a bit:  2 tsp of Kosher salt, 3 tsp lemon juice, 2 cloves of garlic and 3 TBS olive oil.  I skewered the shrimp for a couple of minutes on each side and.... voila - done and delicious.  

Will definitely make this more often

I thought this shrimp recipe was too salty...and I love salty foods normally! I used 1 Tbsp coarse kosher salt  (along with the other marinade ingredients) with a little over a pound of peeled, deveined shrimp. I let it marinate for about 30 minutes, so maybe that was the problem. I probably will not make this again.
Edit: I see that the recipe calls for two pounds of shrimp...I only used 1.25 pounds so that was probably the problem.

This got a "make this again" from the family. Cut the salt down to 1 tsp and it was more than enough. I served it over pasta and zoodles for an easy nights meal.

I tried adjusting the salt as others recommended and only added 1/2 tsp table salt. I probably should've used 1 tsp. Otherwise, the spices were just right.

Fast, easy and delicious. I skewered them and cooked them on the George Foreman because that's what we do in Minnesota when it's below zero and several inches of snow outside.

This recipe is perfect!  I use double the amount of garlic, because why not?  Everyone we've served it to has raved about it.  It definitely has a kick, so if you're a wimp when it comes to spice, you will need to tone down the cayenne.

I did use coarse salt and like many others would highly recommend halving the salt amount. The saltiness is overwhelming.  I'll try it again with the reduced amount and try to remember to post an update

Love this recipe for my shrimp (: the first time I made it, it was still a little too salty for me even with 1tsp table salt. The second time around I probably added about 1/2 tsp table salt instead. I pan fried instead of grilled & it still came out great!

I followed the suggestion to use 1/2 teaspoon salt.  Marinated about 15 minutes.  Loved the charred flavor and spiciness of the shrimp.

We loved it. Will definately make it again. The marinade makes this a very addictive dish. Extremely easy to prepare. Definately 1tsp not 1 tbl of salt.

Everyone at the party raved about this shrimp and begged for the recipe - I was gonna hold off and put the lemon juice in 15 min before cooking so the shrimp wouldn't get rubbery, and the name I nevertheless remembered to add it - still was awesome!!

I made these and they were to die for!  They went quickly and everyone loved them.  
I doubled the marinated sauce and just added a dash of salt, instead of what the recipe called for and barbecued them.
I also marinated them for an hour.

I needed a recipe to flavor shrimp without  having to marinade. I followed the recipe exactly but should have taken the time to read some of the reviews so the shrimp would've have more flavor. As written, we found the shrimp to be bland. I would certainly make this again but use the reviewers tips to increase the flavor.

I used coarse sea salt but only half a tablespoon and it was still too salty.  Next time I'll use less than one teaspoon.

I t was good. I will make again. I only had 1 pound of shrimp. Only recipe change was halving the salt based on the comments. That was plenty of salt. I used the broiler since it was too steamy outside.

I agree, 1 tablespoon of salt  must be a misprint.  I followed the reviews that said only use 1 teaspoon of salt and this recipe was perfect!  Very easy, very tasty and my family loved it.  This recipe is a keeper!

These were great. We are a spicy family so the heat didn't bother us at all. I wouldn't even say these are particularly spicy. They're just right. Delicious. Will make again. Followed recipe exactly.

I made this recipe exactly as listed and I didn't really think about how much salt it called for.  The shrimp were so salty, that I couldn't even eat them.  The spice was also very strong.  With the saltiness and spiciness, the flavor of the shrimp was lost.

My hubby requested shrimp on the BarB for father's day.   I used smoked paprika and since I don't handle capsaicin well, I skipped the cayenne pepper.  Everyone raved about the delicious  shrimp.   We will surely make this again.
Made this recipe again 2 months later using Cayenne but slightly less than 1/2 tsp.  Delicious!

I know someone mentioned that the 1 Tbs of salt isn't a typo, that you just need to use coarse salt.  Well, I used coarse salt and I still felt it was waaaay too much.  I would definitely cut back on that next time.  Other than that, it was easy, quick, and I think with that one minor adjustment, it will be awesome.

These were so easy to make and  delicious. They can go great in a salad, or can be amazing appetizers/sides. I used 1-pound of Gulf Shrimp and didn't have any problems with the shrimp being dry or raw.

This recipe is way off with the salt....1 TABLESPOON....is outrageous.  If in fact it is a t/o....this is a very bad issue to have since a lot of people might not have even challenged it when they read it.  My being a professional Chef don't use measurements when I cook so it is not a problem but for the novice home cook who wants to make something different might follow the recipe verbatim and have to throw it out.  Pretty expensive recipe to have to throw out.

This has been my go to recipe for spicy grilled shrimp for a few years now, replacing one I used forever. It looks too simple to be special, but it's dead easy and brilliant tasting. Use coarse or kosher salt, as she states or cut way back. I'm not sure why people struggled with that. You can play with garlic and dried pepper a bit to suite personal taste. And don't leave those shrimps on the barby too long. .

Other than too much salt, this is a great recipe for grilled shrimp. And I did use coarse salt, not regular table salt. Even though I halved the salt, I will reduce it even more when I make this again. And I'll definitely make it again! The only other change I made was to use smoked paprika rather than plain paprika.

Added smoked tabasco for additional heat and flavour (and to empty the bottle!), very tasty result. Will definitely save this recipe.

Great flavours! Loved every bite of it. Only suggestion would be to marinate them for a while first. No longer than 2 hours though or the lemon will start to 'cook' the shrimp. 
Yummy!

I loved this recipe! I tend to like things spicy, so I added at least an extra tsp. of cayenne pepper, and it was amazing! It didn't have too little or too much spice at all. I did follow one of the reviews and cut the salt to 1 tsp., and it still came out pretty salty-- I can't imagine that using a full tablespoon would taste very good.

I halved the recipe and followed it exactly.  It has way too much salt.  I'd use a 1/4 amount of salt next time.  I made a summer corn salad and mixed the shrimp in trying to make it less salty tasting, but it is still too strong.

quick and easy to do on the grill.    I took the advice of others who suggested the use of less salt and it was perfect.  I served it as an appetizer on a platter with thin lemon slices which dressed it up and my guests raved about it.   I'll definitely make it again!

Excellent!  I do cut down on the salt. I've been making this for about three years and am always asked to bring it to picnics and family gatherings. When I make it for myself, which is often, I always make sure to have plenty leftover for lunch the next day.

My wife, kids and I all loved it with ribeye steak.  Only change I made was to add a tablespoon or so of sriracha hot chili sauce.  After brushing on, I didn't have any left, as it JUST covered the whole 2 lbs of shrimp (perfect proportions on the recipe, I'd say).  I will be sure to cut way back on the salt next time.  I used a coarse kosher salt.  I could have used one third to half the specified amount, and the shrimp would have been plenty salty for us.

I generally pat the shrimp dry with a paper towel, the mixture sticks to the shrimp much better. I also omitted the salt.

I can't believe I've never rated this recipe.  Other than using 1 tsp. of salt (vs. one tablespoon) and using smoked paprika, I follow the recipe exactly.  This has been our go-to favorite recipe for grilled shrimp for shrimp tacos. We serve them on fresh, warm corn tortillas with homemade salsa, pico de gallo, sour cream, avocado and shredded cabbage on the side for people to add as they'd like.  So easy, quick and delicious.  I thread the shrimp on skewers before grilling to make turning them easier.  A wonderful recipe!

Pay attention to the Salt.  As other users have stated, Coarse Salt is NOT the same as Table Salt.  I used 1 TBS of Coarse Salt and my shrimp were just right.  I broiled, on a foil lined cookie sheet and recommend 3 minutes, pull the cookie sheet out and flip the shrimp, broil another 2 minutes.  They come out PERFECT!

My husband said the best part was licking his fingers while eating!

Way too much salt. I will make it again because it sounds really good but I will probably start with 1 tsp and work my way up.

Will definitely make this tasty, quick shrimp recipe again.  I used only used enough coarse salt to make a paste of the garlic. And, as my taste buds require, I added a pinch more cayenne!

The smokey flavor of the paprika coupled with the cayenne pepper was the perfect combination!!!  I let the shrimp marinade for 15 minutes before grilling them.  A keeper for sure.

This is a great recipe! After reading the reviews I did reduce the salt to 1 tsp. I also used coconut oil instead of olive oil. I'm going to use this recipe again only instead of shrimp I am going to use tilapia.

Tried recipe as is, skewed shrimp, maybe 3 minutes per side on medium to hot grill (400 deg.). Excellent! Wouldn't change a thing, the spices gave the shrimp a nice bite, not too hot. Served as surf and turf with a nice grilled tenderloin! Yum!

This is so easy and so delicious! There's too much salt in the recipe so put in just a teaspoon instead of a tablespoon. I also add a little sugar so it makes the shrimp's coating a tiny bit crunchier without adding sweetness.

Wow...this was WAY too salty, especially with the lemon juice added. I didn't leave the shrimp in the sauce at all, just tossed then put them on a skewer to grill.

This had a great spice level. I didn't have any course salt, so I used table salt and added only 1/2 teaspoon. On the side, I made an extra batch of sauce but doubled the olive oil and lemon juice. I heated the extra batch of sauce. I then tossed it with cooked pasta and put the grilled shrimp on top. I then garnished with a sprinkle of freshly grated Parmesan. 
This was very good and we will definitely be making this again!

Way too much salt as other reviewers have said. Next time I will try it with 1 teaspoon of salt instead of a tablespoon. The spicy flavor was good and I am anxious to try it again without so much saltiness.

Have made this recipe a couple of times recently and we can't get enough!!!  So spicy and good.  Couldn't be simpler, too.  I highly recommend for that night when you want to cook on the grill but are tired of the same old beef/pork/chicken!!

I love this recipe and make it often.  I haven't changed the recipe at all.  If you use Coarse Salt like it says, it's not too salty.  I mix all the ingredients together in a ziplock and then add the shrimp.  Awesome appetizer!!

Very good and simple recipe.  I did let them sit for about half an hour in the fridge and they did seem too salty but still delicious.  I will cut down the salt next time.  Served over a nice salad with a simple light lime dressing.

Way too salty and I used the course salt . There is not enough salt. I reduced the salt by one third. Doubled the red pepper and added red pepper chile flakes. Tripled the lemon juice and made one third of the juice lime instead of lemon. Added 4 cloves of garlic. I tried the chilli sauce as some cooks recommend but used half the bottle. This is extremely salty and bland if you follow recipe? Use Jumbo shrimp bc they shrink so much on the frill. The medium shrimp become tiny and tough.

Made this for the first time, served it over wild rice and topped with grilled pineapple salsa. The flavor of the shrimp was delicious, and paired nicely with a slightly sweet counterpart (the salsa). We'll definitely use this again!

Delicious! I really liked the flavor and plan on adding a little more cayenne pepper for a little more kick! I did cutback on the salt. I put the shrimp and paste in a ziplock bag and let it marinate for about an hour. I plan on trying this with chicken!

So I didn't know the difference between coarse salt and table salt and ended up putting a full tbsp of table salt in. However having tasted the marinade, I decided to leave the shell on the shrimp to perhaps help with the saltiness. This worked out perfectly!! The shrimp tasted fantastic and I loved the well balanced spice in the marinade. I didn't leave the shrimp marinading in the sauce either - I only briefly coated in and then put it straight on the grill.

YUM.  Just a few twists of our salt grinder.  Let sit for 20 min in marinade, added lemon juice last 5 min so shrimp wouldn't get soggy.  Served with zucchini noodles.

As written this is too salty, I cut the salt down to 1/2 tsp kosher salt and used slightly less cayenne pepper as a personal preference as the first time was slightly too hot.  With those changes we loved this over rice.

Been making this for years! I leave the shells ON. That helps temper the heat. A bit messier when eating, though!

I doubled the sauce and omitted the paprika.  Marinated in the sauce one hour before putting on the grill.  Next time will double sauce with the exception of cayenne and omit paprika.  Really enjoyed these shrimp, even though a little hot for our tastes.

Excellent.  Don't let it marinade with the lemon for more than 15-20 minutes as it will wreck the shrimp.  It can sign in the other stuff and add lemon at end or better yet, mix marinade in ziploc and throw shrimp in 20 minutes before grilling.

I read previous reviews and made the adjustment from coarse salt to regular salt, so I used 1 tsp regular salt.  It was still WAY TOO MUCH SALT.

This was super easy to prepare and cook.  I didn't use as much salt and I think I used more cayenne pepper, sometimes I just dump and don't measure, this was one of those recipes.  I let the shrimp set it seasoning mix for about 30 minutes adding the juice of half a lemon the last 5 minutes and grilled, they were wonderful!

Like this recipe a lot.  Thank you for posting it.  I'm learning every time.  I had frozen cooked shrimp in my freezer and thought it would be simple to use what I had.  I recommend not using cooked shrimp.  You have to thaw and make sure they are not wet but worst than that is the fact that they cook way to fast on the grill.  Of course, now the shrimp is over cooked and a little rubbery.  But the recipe was great and we still enjoyed it.  Thanks again for the post.

Great recipe!  For those saying that it is too salty, are you using regular salt?  You need to use a coarse salt such as Kosher Salt.  This is a very easy recipe that everyone loves.  I am asked to make this each time I am invited to an event!  Enjoy....

Made this last night...delicious and if you like spicy you will like this recipe. Followed the marinade exactly and made shish kabobs.  I used pineapple to balance the spiciness of the shrimp, along with green peppers and onion which I par cooked in the microwave so they would be more tender. I also tossed the pepper and onions in olive oil and kosher salt before adding them to the skewers.  Very pretty too!  Will make again!

I reduced the serving size to 3 because I only had 1 lbs of shrimp.  I prepared them and let them marinate for about 8 hours.  Everyone loved them (even our friend who is a really picky eater!  Will definitely be making this one again!!

This recipe was simple and tasted great.  I let it marinate in the refrigerator for 45 minutes before grilling.  I accidentally put in twice the amount of cayenne so it was VERY spicy.  For those aren't familiar with making the garlic paste I recommend reducing the salt to 1 tsp and just mix it with minced garlic instead as others have suggested.

I used lime instead of lemon (no lemons) which I did not measure (just used the juice of one small lime) and no salt since I was using warm water shrimp (which I find are too salty if additional salt is added).  The flavors were spot on and a big hit - it was gone before I had a chance to get a photo. We will definitely have again.

Got this recipe emailed to me just in time for some shrimp I was going to grill. Must have been a sign as they were very well liked. After reading some reviews I didn't use a tbsp of salt, instead I used a heaping tsp. Used frozen shrimp that had some ice on them, next time I might thaw them first or marinade them longer, the flavor was faint but it was still good. Will be using this again.

Loved it, no modifications needed! Would serve for guests but maybe reduce spiciness for them.

Delicious! I had 40 shrimp and doubled the marinade. I let them marinate for about 5 minutes before putting them on wooden skewers    ( that had been soaked in water to prep them for the grill).Grilled them for them 2-3 minutes as recommended and they were perfect.

I served it with kale salad,sweet rice and a spicy mango coconut sauce which was a sweet heat to the kick of the shrimp. Definitely saving this recipe and definitely making again.

Yes, I love it!! I think when recipe list coarse salt, some people need clearer info.  Coarse salt is usually sea salt or kosher salt.  Much bigger grains that normal table salt, therefore, you need more!!!

I have been making this exact recipe for 20+ years!  It has been passed around forever - good cold or room temp over salad with a light vinaigrette or as an hors d'oeuvre with a ketchup mayo worschestershire dip.

This recipe is awesome!  I'm from the south and have had shrimp all sorts of ways...but this recipe is spicy and delicious..  Sometimes shrimp can be bland, but not with this marinade!  Spicy enough, but not overpowering!! Yum!!

I thought this was really good, but I'm sorry it is TOO SALTY! I did use 1 T. coarse salt, not regular salt.  I am one who likes salty and this was just too much.  Next time I will cut it in half.  Otherwise a really good and easy recipe.  I skewered mine because I don't have a grill basket.  I will definitely make this again.

Made this tonight for my family.  It was a hit!  I had to make a double batch of sauce since my 1kg of shrimp needed more coating.  The first batch I had used the lemon however, my second one, I ran out of lemon and substituted lime.  Both ways were great!

Somewhat spicey but really good! And easy! We put them on skewers and that is what took the longest. Will definitely make again!

Once again, I love this recipe. It's also good to plop a small amount on oysters while they steam.

I have enjoyed this recipe for a couple of years now. Like others, I cut the salt in half. My twist is that I placed them in a foil pan, added butter and put them in my electric smoker for approximately 20 minutes @ 225 degrees. I have used a variety of wood chips, and all work well. Generally I use a combo of oak, hickory, applewood and just a bit of mesquite. Every time I have made these, they have lasted less than 5 minutes. The last two times I only got to eat 1 maybe 2 for myself. Definitely worth trying, whether on the grill, in a smoker or in a broiler. One last thing, last time I added Tres Chile Cilantro seasoning from AJ's fine foods. Delicious!

Great recipe.  I used 1tsp salt and added the Old Bay which I think was critical to the recipe.  I also added 3 cloves to one lb of shrimp.  Fabulous recipe.  Will be making it and serving over cheesy grits (with a little applewood bacon tossed in).

Delicious and  very easy to prepare. I used homemade Emeril's Essence and a lime instead of a lemon, then I marinated it for a few hours before grilling. It was a big hit!

A real keeper, one you will pass on to family members, it is so good. I will cut the salt to 3/4 T next time. I used Kosher salt and maybe should have used coarser salt. We put the shrimp on a caesar salad (in a bag from the grocery store) with 1/2 the bag of dressing...so good.

This was really good.  I only used a pinch of salt... the tablespoon salt must be a mistake by the author.  I did try this recipe once before and it was WAY too salty at a tablespoon.  So salty I could barely eat them.  A pinch was just right.

Yummers!  Everyone at the table loved these.  I can see lots of possibilities to use  in other recipes as some of the other reviewers suggested.  There seemed to be some questions about the amount of salt.  I did use about 3/4 T. & increased the amount of garlic.  I thought the shrimp was a bit salty, but, everyone else said "NO!..they where seasoned perfectly!!"

This had a wonderful flavor. I didn't feel that the salt was too much at all. Maybe other reviewers are using regular table salt instead of coarse salt. I will definitely be making this again, thank you!

These were very good although 1 tblsp salt is way too much.  I would cut it down to half or less.  I also sliced some Italian bread, spread olive oil on top and grilled both sides.  Topped this with the shrimp and it makes a great appetizer or meal.

Wow - these are VERY spicy, but very good!  The only thing I changed was only using 1/2 tsp of salt after reading the reviews and I added a couple of dashes of Old Bay.  This may become my standard quick and easy shrimp recipe!

This is a great recipe! It was exactly what I was searching for. I did add a bit of butter to make the flavor a more rich and I let it marinate in the mixture for a few hours after the shrimp had dethawed. I peeled the shells off before marinating and then we used our charcoal grill to grill them up in a grill pan. DELICIOUS!

This recipe was too salty (and my husband and I are both salt lovers), but otherwise very flavorful and worth using agin. The salt is an easy fix for the next time.

This was fantastic! We all loved it. A bit less salt would be good.

I guess it's really my fault that these weren't as great since I've never grilled shrimp before...let's just say they were a little crispy--next time I'm turning the temperature down on the grill to around medium-low.

Very easy and tasty Shrimp dish, I found it a little on the salty side and might modify next time. My GF thought it was perfectly fine so it might just be my opinion.

This was very quick and easy. Made it for our cookout on July 4th it was an instant hit.  Will be making it again this weekend but will add more spices and let marinate longer.

WAY TOO MUCH SALT!!!  I would cut the salt down to 1 teaspoon.  Aside from that, the flavor was good.

Very good.  I didn't follow the recipe (I rarely ever do) but read the recipe, then headed to the kitchen to throw it together.  But it was very good.  Used veg oil, as I was out of EVOO, used crushed red pepper instead of cayenne.  Nice and spicy.

Fabulous. Very easy and delicious. I cut the recipie in half and used a one pound bag of frozen cooked, tail on shrimp (I thawed the shrimp under cold running water for 5 minutes first). Served with grilled veggies and Basmati rice. Excellent!

Excellent recipe and simple as others stated. It was a hit with the family. I like it in that the shrimp does not have to be marinated very long for such a delicious flavor.  Only thing I cut back on was salt after reading other reviews. I used half a tablespoon of sea salt.  This is going to be a keeper. Served mine over an herb flavored rice. Yummy!!

These were really good! I didn't have any cayenne pepper (didn't realize till I started making these) so I added chili powder and red pepper flakes.  They still tasted great and got rave reviews!  I let them marinade for about 15-20 minutes.  Then put them in a grilling basket on the grill.  There were no leftovers!

Amazing. For whatever reason, doesn't taste like you'd expect it to based on the ingredients.  I let it marinate for about 10 minutes before grilling, added 1/2 tsp of Old Bay but otherwise followed the directions.  The result is slightly spicy but mostly rich, buttery and flavorful. This is a keeper.

Really good!  Only change I made was to double all ingredients except the salt.  I had to broil these due to the weather and they were still delicious, but I'm sure they would be even better on the grill.

We broiled these and marinated them for about an hour ahead of time. For us, we liked it in a salad with a vinagrette type dressing, and alone, it was okay...but not the most flavorful as we expected. It was an easy and quick marinade to make with things around the house, so that was nice, I may add a bit more cayenne next time for a lil more zip... overall I would make it again, its a nice base to personalize..

Very good recipe for shrimp. I did make changes based on my own personal taste preference. I added an extra garlic clove, a litte more cayenne pepper and olive oil. I also minced a small shallot. Added in a little dried parsely. Delicous!!

This is one of the better recipes for shrimp that I have found. The spices and flavor was good. I was looking for more spicey than this, but next time I will add red pepper, and more cayenne pepper. I cooked it on low broil in my oven. Turned out so moist. Leftovers were great the next day...

When my husband pulled this off the grill, he popped one in his mouth and said "This may be the best shrimp I've ever had.!"  Combine that with how easy it was and this is definitely a 5-star meal.  I reduced the salt to 1 tsp but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Served with brown rice and broccoli - very healthy dinner to boot!

pretty darn good.  my changes: 1) 3 cloves of garlic, 2) 1 teaspoon of salt, 3) 1 tbsp of oil, 4) juice from 1 whole lemon, 5) 1 lb of shrimp (thawed frozen uncooked), 6) added 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper.  pan-grilled shrimp over medium heat for 2 minutes per side.  def would make again, especially since it is so easy and requires very little prep.

Absolutely delish! Used a little more of all the spices to make the mixture a little thicker, it stuck on the shrimp better that way. I also wrapped in bacon. A strip of bacon enough to wrap three shrimp. Very spicy, bacon countered spiciness a bit.

This was a great recipe!  I didn't grill but instead broiled them in the oven. They turned out great.  I made some couscous and served the shrimp over the couscous with some of the sauce.  I listened to other reviews and only put about 1/4 t salt if that. Will definitely make again.

I'm a big seafood eater and it was so nice to incorporate the spice to the shrimp. I made burritos and added the Serano Cilantro dressing shared on allrecipes.com. Last, I did not add any salt and was still very rich. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Very flavorful shrimp. I will definitely make these again! Though next time I will allow the shrimp to merinade for at least thrity minutes before grilling them. I used about 1/2 a tsp of salt, not the 1 tablespoon stated.

TOO SALTY AS IS! I read the other reviews, but forgot to change the recipe to cut the salt when I re-wrote it onto my recipe cards. Otherwise, from what I can taste past the salt, its pretty good.

These were sooo good! I followed the recipe exactly. I grilled them on my george forman gril & they came out awesome! I can't wait to make them again/ Except I used small frozen precooked shrimp. They were good but too small & easily dried out. I cannot wait to buy some fresh bigger shrimp & try this recipe again, it was delicious!

These were SO salty.  The recipe as it is, is awful!  I suspect if you reduce the 1 tablespoon of salt to 1 teaspoon then it will be much better.

I was looking for a quick and easy recipe for shrimp and found this.  Didn't think it was going to be anything great, but I was proven wrong.  The shrimp turned out delicious!  My tastebuds were very pleased.

I wish I read the reviews first and adjusted the salt.  Way too much!  I would cut it in half.  The flavor was great though.  Will definitely make this again with less salt.

I keep forgetting to rate these. I've made them so many times and they are REALLY good. They come out perfectly on the Foreman grill. 

Thanks for a great recipe!

This is so delicious!! We have been eating this once or twice a week now.  Had to make one important change though. There is way too much salt.  I cut it down to 1/2 tsp and it is plenty.  I would give it 5 stars if it hadn't tasted so salty the first time I made it.

Delicious and simple.  I also reduced the Kosher salt to one tsp, and substituted Chili powder for Cayenne.  I grilled it on a counter-top Cuisinart grill and everyone loved it.

I substituted chili powder for the cayenne pepper and added a little bit of teriyaki sauce and it was great, though I think I will reduce the salt a little next time.

This was great.  I used 1.25 pounds of shrimp so I basically eyeballed the seasonings but used 2 cloves of garlic since I love it.  Easy to make and the whole family loved it.  Served with grilled asparagus.  YUM!

I made this for a large party which included other barbecued items, and thought these were very good...not too spicy, not too bland.  They were perhaps a bit too salty for some of my guests, but it seemed to depend upon the person.  I will use this recipe again, maybe try reducing the salt and adding a little Old Bay seasoning, as another reviewer mentioned.

All in all it is a great recipe, but 1 tablespoon of salt is too much. I will make this again, only I will reduce the salt to 1/2 tablespoon next time.

My family loves this.  I alternate shrimp & scallops on skewers with this recipe.  Quick easy and delicious! Each time I make this I am asked for the recipe.  We have this at home at least once a week and I'm requested to bring to to all get togethers.

This shrimp ROCKED. It had the perfect blend of spice and heat. Although it had a little to much heat for the husband. If you like it hot & spicy well this shrimp is for you.

Made these for our cookout yesterday, and everybody loved them. Nobody had mentioned they were too salty like some of the other reviews I've read. I used the full tablespoon of coarse kosher salt. I did cut the cayenne in half because I didn't want them too spicy. They were so good!

This was great!!  I made it for Father's Day and my husband loved it.  It's definitely a keeper!  I didn't have a garlic clove on hand, so I used garlic infused Olive Oil.  Next time I make it I'm going to halve the salt - it was a bit on the salty side for our taste and my husband needs to watch his salt intake.

I am normally a "follow the recipe exactly" person, but I didn't have cayenne or lemons for this recipe.  I put a dash of red pepper flakes in the marinade and all of the other ingredients, minus the lemon juice.  I let my pound of prawns marinade for about 40 minutes and then squeezed the juice of a lime over them just before grilling.  Wow, they were fabulous, simple and quick.  I paired it with filet minon and my husband said it was the best meal I have ever cooked!

Unless your flavor preference is primarily salt.. then i would not reccomend this recipe. Just ruined a pound of shrimp with it. Only Marinated 10 minutes but just way too much salt in the mix... I give it two thumbs down!

Very tasty and easy to make.  Had a bottle of minced garlic instead of garlic cloves, so used that with regular salt following the suggestion of another reviewer.  Put the shrimp on skewers to grill, and had a yummy, spicy dinner.  Thanks!

this recipe is excellent just as it is!  Thanks!

I'm sometimes annoyed when folks take a good recipe and then make a million changes to it...  So, I was a bit reluctant to add this...but...

I happened to have a small, already grilled  filet mignon (left over from last night), I sliced it and put pieces of beef between the shrimp...  

Served with some sesame/ginger rice and some sauteed yellow squash with a bit of onion..and a bottle of merlot,  one of the best meals I've done in months!

But, as mentioned, even without the beef this recipe would have been great.

This was a hit with my family and picky children but I made it a bit different. I used only half the cayenne and half the paprika but all the salt and it was too salty. I did use fresh lemon. Good flavor but a bit too salty and I LOVE salt. I am making it tonight  for grilling catfish. This time I am using half the salt but all the other stuff the right way. Hope we like it. Maybe if I would follow it right, it would be good!!

My husband and I love shrimp and enjoy 
trying different ways to prepare them. I have to say this recipe was okay, but nothing special. I don't think I'd go out of my way to make them again though. I guess after reading the reviews, maybe my expectations were too high. We love spicy and combined with shrimp I thought this would be a winner, but it fell short and lacked the WOW!

yummy, definitely a keeper, just one hint to those making this recipe. Dont baste the shrimp with the remaining sauce unless you like your food really hot.Other than that its an excellent recipe.

I used lime juice and skewered the shrimp first.  Rubbed the paste on about an hour to marinate a little.  These were excellent!

My husband is nuts over this recipe. Every time we cook out this is what he requests and he's actually taken over the preparation and grilling on this one. I'm not a huge shrimp fan, but this is delicious. We like spicy food so we add a little bit more red pepper than is called for. It's perfect and easy especially since we buy the shrimp already skewered.

I very much enjoyed this recipe. I had everything in my kitchen except for the coarse salt, and I used 1/4 tsp. of regular salt instead; that was plenty of salt for us. I did the crushing with my mortar and pestle, mixed everything in it and the paste came out great. It isn't the best grilled shrimp recipe, but it's nice, really fast, easy and it has very common ingredients. Will definetely make again!

Awesome.  I loved it!  If you are not a really "spicy" eater, cut back on the cayenne pepper a bit.

YUMBONI !!  This was VERY easy and very yummy.  They are quite spicy though, so be aware of that.  Thanks for the recipe.

I couldn't believe how mixed the reviews were over this recipe..so had to try it for myself..we made this using about about 1 1/2 ts of coarse salt. (this was a dinner for 4 and all agreed)...it was unfortunately too salty for our liking. (and I'm a salt fan)..marinated the shrimp for about half hour and used Old Bay instead of cayenne and omitted the paprika. Used bamboo skewers and threaded the shrimp for easy grilling.  We will make this again because the prep was so fast..but will reduce the salt to 1 tsp, and will use the paprika next time as well. Loved the idea of making the paste with the salt and garlic.

The flavor is good, not wonderful. I used skewers for easy turning on the grill and they cooked beautifully.  Marinated shrimp 30 minutes with less salt and cayenne.

This is a great recipe!  My husband loved them, too, and he's not the biggest seafood eater.  They were spicy, but not too spicy - just right.  I'll definitely make them again - super easy!  You would pay a lot for a meal like this in a restaurant.

Excellent recipe.  Easy and yummy.  Takes very little time to prepare and is great to feed guests.  It's a keeper.  Be sure to crush the garlic with the salt - otherwise it's just not the same.

This was o.k....I marinated it for 24 hours and it was not as flavorful as I thought it would be..maybe I did something wrong...But .my 9 year old daughter gobbled it up so it wasn't a total waste of time or shrimp :)

Obvioulsy from reading the reviews my husband and I are the only ones who did not care for this recipe. Followed the recipe exactly, but the taste did not "click" with us. Maybe the cayenne?We love shrimp, prepared any ole way, but not this way. As expensive as shrimp is I will not be making this again. Sorry.

This was great!! My fiance didn't even think he liked shrimp, but he really liked this and said he would eat it again. I didn't use coarse salt and jumbo shrimps due to what I had available, I just used regular salt and smaller shrimps and it was really good. Thanks!

We made this last night without the salt.  You absolutely do not need it!  This was so good - we kept sneaking back into the fridge to eat the leftovers.  I can't wait to try it as a filler for shrimp tacos.  Thanks!!

Super yummy! Everyone raved about the shrimp at Easter dinner! Great taste! Used 2 garlic cloves, 1/2 tsp. table salt, and 1 tsp. Cajun Seasoning instead of paprika. Yummy!

Wonderful! I inadvertently marinaded the shrimp for about a half hour, and they turned out extra spicy and really good. I grilled four to a skewer (soak bamboo skewers in water to avoid burning). This is a great way to prepare shrimp for shrimp tacos or shrimp enchiladas. I'll definitely make these again.

Made exactly as stated but let the shrimp marinade for about an hour before cooking them.  My oldest son thought they were too spicy but the rest of the family really liked.  Thanks Suz

I also added more garlic and lemon and lime juice.  I cut back a shade on cayenne, but next time I won't.  I grilled on my indoor grill on skewers, but just a tad too long.  Will make again, but next time I'll watch them a little closer.

Great recipe for shrimp!  The first time I made this appetizer was for a 4th of July get together.  I recently made this again for a group of my girl friends and they loved it.  I have passed it along to all of them.

This was great --- a large hit at the BBQ.  Will definately make again.  I was out of Old Bay & will try that next time.  But the paprika certainly didn't let me down!

Pretty good but not as good as some other shrimp recipes i've tried. Thanks and will probably make it again.

What a great recipe!  We didn't have Kosher salt, so I used table salt and used 1/2 TBSP. The shrimp were flavored, but not really spicy.  

It took about 1/2 hour to devein 24 shrimp.  Perhaps I am slow or just a perfectionist, so the prep time was a little longer for me. 

The result was SO worth the time! Will certainly make this recipe again!

These are the best spicy shrimp!  I coated the shrimp but the sauce was too runny so after I broiled them, I poured the shrimp and sauce over pasta with a little (okay - a lot of) grated parmesan cheese...it was yummy
