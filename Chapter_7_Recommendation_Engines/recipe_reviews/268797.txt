Excellent! I use Sazon often and keep in in my freezer. Now I can make my own, it is so simple, AND there is no MSG. Perfect! Thanks for sharing!

Quick and easy. I suggest you double or triple the recipe if you plan to save it for later use.

I'm happy this recipe worked out for Soup Loving Nicole and Cookie Lover! :-) As the author of this recipe, I want to point out an error in the ingredient list. If you are using annatto, omit the turmeric. If you do not have annatto, use 1 tablespoon paprika and 1 1/2 teaspoons ground turmeric.
