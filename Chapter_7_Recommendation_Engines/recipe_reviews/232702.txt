The recipe is very good. Excellent garlicky taste . Although instead if water I used chicken broth and no salt. I decreased the butter by two tablespoons and added 8 oz sharp cheddar. We love cheese but lots of packages come in 8 oz so I used what we had. We will definitely make this again and again. Yummy!!!

As a Southern girl, I do love me some garlic cheese grits, just not this much garlic. Perfect otherwise. Of course, using less garlic powder or substituting real garlic is easy enough to do. I also do not like grits cooked as firm as cornbread. I checked them at 30 minutes and then cooked them just barely past the jiggly stage.

I made this a couple of days before a Kentucky Derby party.  I refrigerated it unbaked until the day of the party, then baked it to serve.  It worked out great.

Five stars as a great base for consistency and flavor! I did use low sodium chicken broth in place of water, about 1/2 cup of crumbled bacon and 1/2 cup parmesan cheese in addition to about 8 oz of shredded cheddar. The biggest notation here, though, is the GARLIC! I love garlic but, heeding other reviews, I reduced the garlic by half and it was still a little too much IMO. I use a premium, American grown garlic with zero filler - maybe it's just stronger than some other brands. I did not put the cheese on top because we like to fry our grits before serving them, so I added a little more to the grits, as noted above.

I absolutely loved this! The flavor is amazing, and I'll definitely make it again! My only problem is that I live at high altitude, so I need to figure out what to do to make it set correctly.

It turned out to be a go to recipe.  Great, a good sub for rice as a side dish.

Excellent recipe.  I made a double batch  as a "just in case" but found that I really didn't need that much for 9 people.  I used less of the garlic (about 1 tsp) as other recommended and I'm so glad I did.  It would have overpowered the dish. I really like the flavor of hot sauce so I added more.  I'll be making this again.

I have made this recipe many times and it is always good. I had them on the menu for New Years Day dinner along with blackeyed peas and ham, biscuits and greens. Yum!

Delicious!  I used 8 oz extra sharp white cheddar, put the mixture in 2 round casseroles, topped each with a round slice of provolone cheese, and baked.  Very pretty result as the area with the provolone browned in a circle and I garnished the center with a sprig of rosemary.

DELISH! A little strong on the garlic... Next time I will halve the Gilroy Garlic as per previous reviews. But this recipe is a keeper!

I  remember my mother making these when I was a child. This recipe was just how she made them. I now have it saved to my favourites and even copied in my recipe box.

Wow, these were amazing! I did not read the recipe thoroughly before I made it and didn't realize you had to bake it, so I just cooked the grits and added in the other ingredients. I added half the cheese and sprinkled the rest on top, then re-covered it to let the cheese melt. They were still amazing even if I made them wrong. I served it with grilled shrimp--such a great combination! Thanks for the recipe!

I had trouble finding instant polenta so I used regular yellow polenta, cooking it about 10 minutes, subbed half of the water with broth and baked as directed. Will consider adding  a little onion, mushrooms and or peppers. Thanks for providing a versatile and forgiving recipe.

I made this recipe twice this past weekend - the first time I made it x6 and the second time x2. So the first thing I'll say is that it scales up well. I found that the result was not firm like cornbread either time, but it was still tasty and people liked it. The second time I left out the butter entirely because the butter just formed a large pool of melted grease on the top. The second time I also didn't put any of the cheese on top - I mixed it all in. The second version was much better. I used half extra sharp cheddar and half pepper jack. I also used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder. Next time I will add even more hot sauce.

This was very good and easy to make.  I used old fashioned grits instead of quick cooking grits and turned out great.

This was a great recipe to serve with my Baby Back and St Louis style ribs (cooked low and slow on my smoker).  As others noted, I only had an 8 oz bag of shredded cheddar, and that worked out great. I used about 2/3 in the recipe and 1/3 on top in the oven. The top layer added a nice crisp to the texture.

Reading the other reviews, I decided to substitute 2 tbsp minced garlic for the garlic powder.  This got rave reviews from my visiting southerner relative!

This was, I am sad to say, absolutely horrendous. There’s far too much garlic in here. In addition to that, I found the egg/milk mixture completely unnecessary. It added a strange texture to the grits.
