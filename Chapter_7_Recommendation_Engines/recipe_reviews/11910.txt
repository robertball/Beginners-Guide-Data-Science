I gave this recipe 4 stars because we hated it the first time I made it. It was WAY too garlicy and salty plus the texture was mushy with bits of chicken and cashews. The second time I made it I read the reviews and made the according changes. I also added a few of my own changes as well...
The biggest change was that I did NOT cook the noodles. I just crushed them in the bag and added to the salad raw. I also substituted sunflower seeds for the cashews. I added the chicken  hot right out of the pan which wilted the spinach some. 
As for the dressing, I cut the garlic down to one clove and only used one flavor packet. I also added one teaspoon of red wine vinegar, one tablespoon of sugar and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper. We ate the dressing on the side...because of its intense flavor not everyone liked the same amount of dressing so some used less of it than others. With the changes I made, my hubby and I give it a 5 star rating.

I followed others' advice and only used one seasoning packet to cut salt.  I also substituted feta for gorgonzola (personal preference) and water chestnuts for the cashews (to cut calories and I already had them on hand).  Result = delicious and a great new way to use a college student staple!

OK, I loved this salad. Absolutely, positively loved it...it was really that good! I followed the advice of another reviewer and let the dressing sit in the fridge for half an hour for the flavors to mingle, put ONE seasoning packet in the dressing instead of two (which remedied the "dressing was too salty" complaint I saw from a lot of other reviewers.) My noodles fell apart when I cooked them, so I broke them up with a fork when adding them to the salad. Instead of red pepper, I used an orange pepper, cut into bite-size cubes, since that was what I had on hand. I think I might have a new favorite salad. Thanks so much for submitting this recipe...we love it!

WOW!!!  .  only made a few changes.  mixed everything but chicken and spinach together....  i crushed ramen noodles but did not cook.  substituted red wine vinegar for the lemon b/c i didnt' have lemon.   i put lemon pepper in the dressing to make up for not having lemon in it...  i let all this sit for about 2 hours and that softened the ramen.  I mixed all that with the spinach and chicken and it was one of the best recipes i've tried in a long time....  loved gargonzola, but may try feta next time per hubby request...

I love this combination of food; but I made one major change to keep it lower carb, and those noodles are so not good for you!  There are many salad recipes that call for ramen noodles, and I often leave them out,  add extra nuts and seeds (sunflower, almond slivers and sesame work well) I 'brown/roast' them in a non stick pan first.  You get the nice crunch that the noodles give, but the nuts are tastier and healthier.  For the dressing I play around with different seasoning salts, or chicken or veggie broth powder  and get the same or better results as with the seasoning packet.

The salad part was good but the dressing was too garlicy (and I love garlic). Fortunatly I put the dressing on the side. I will try something with lemon and mustard and oil.

This salad was okay, but the dressing was horribly salty.  I added sugar and thinned it with water and it was still too much.  Ruined the salad.  I think it could have been delicious with a different dressing.

This was very tasty. I added some pepper and dried oregano and I also drained the noodles. It was VERY tasty, and I didn't feel bad about my health afterwards!

Different, but not bad. I only used one package of ramen noodles, and had to sustitute or completely omit many of the salad ingredients. I left the dressing on the side and only used the one seasoning packet, but it came out surprisingly well. After letting the lemon, garlic and seasoning sit for fifteen minutes I whisked it with the mayo and olive oil and then let it sit in the fridge for a half hour. It mellowed considerably and thickened a bit, as well. Not for everyone, but I would probably make this again.

It was a tad time consuming, but the results were really good. The dressing was delicious, I made it without the grapes and the bell pepper and it turned out great.

Added green onion and celery; used olive oil, red wine vinegar, mustard, 1 clove garlic, salt, and pepper for the dressing; did not cook the noodles; added no packets or mayo; used feta; had only an 8oz container of spinach on hand. Delicious. Will make again.
