This recipe is very similar to my dad's very popular bean recipe that has been a family favorite for years. What I really liked about this recipe is the unique combination of beans--it makes for an attractive medley of colors and flavor. The peppers are great addition too. (I added a yellow pepper for extra color and flavor as well.) To kick it up another notch, I also added some garlic, dash of ground mustard and used spicy italian sausage instead of pork sausage. (I was worried the italian spice would compete with the BBQ flavors, but it blended perfectly.)  Overall, it was great and everyone loved it.

This recipe is great! Even finicky Hubby loved it.  I even left out the brown sugar and it was still yummy.  The next day I took the leftovers and added a cup of v8 juice, a cup of water and a can of stewed tomatoes and turned it into a nice bean soup.

Oh my goodness. This recipe is FABULOUS!!!! I took it to a church function and everyone raved about it, including my husband. The only thing that I did differently was I cooked it for 12 hours on low and added about a 1/2 cup of water to thin out the sauce a little at the end of the 12 hours. I cooked it this long only because our church dinner was right after morning church so there wasn't enough time to cook it in the morning. I will definitely use it again, no changes at all!!!

I got this recipe via the "Dinner Spinner" iPhone app and it was a true winner!  I made it as written, only changing the brown sugar content to only 1/4 cup of Splenda Brown Sugar Blend (had to make them friendly for diabetic loved ones).  Fantastic!  I was wary of the wax beans and green beans in them, but no - don't leave these out, they really are great!  I'll be making these again for sure!

My family loved this dish, and I have plenty of left overs!  The only changes I made was reducing the amount of brown sugar to 1/2 cup; however, it was still too much sugar for me.

These beans turned out great for a party and a lot of people asked me for the recipe.  I used only half of the brown sugar and it was plenty sweet.  I also used spicy chili beans, and substituted half of the sausage with hot sausage.  I didn't have any fennel, so had to leave that out.  They turned out great.  (The picture of the recipe above does not do this dish justice!)

My first time making baked beans, I chose this recipe because it seemed foolproof and used a slow cooker. I followed it pretty much as written, except for halving the sausage (though I wished later that I hadn't because it would have been meatier), and I substituted a can of navy beans for the limas because it seemed a bit weird to have all those green vegetably beans in there. And I cooked it for about 10 hours instead of 5 hours -- a girl's gotta work all day, after all! Turned out fine though and I got several compliments.

These are awesome! I bbq almost every weekend during the summer and these are a staple on our menu now. I will never serve baked beans out of the can again.

Pretty good.  I used fresh green and wax beans, and frozen black-eyed peas instead of black beans.  Followed the recipe the rest of the way- cooked on the stove in my dutch oven instead of a crockpot.  Flavorful, sweet and savory, but the fennel was a bit much, next time I'll leave it out.

The only thing I didn't put in here was the cut green beans, mostly because I forgot to get them from the store. The more I thought about it though I wouldn't have added them, 5 hours in the slow cooker is way too much for green beans, yuck! I only added 1/3 cup of brown sugar (I didn't want them too sweet) and these turned out great. I thought there wouldn't be enough liquid, but after 5 hours it was delicious.

Greatest beans ever.  Have made them many times and everyone loves them.  I add andouille at times and that's good instead of the italian sausage.  I also use Sweet Baby Rays Chipotle BBQ sauce.

I was nervous about these but I trusted the good reviews and the beans were delicious!  I forgot to buy a large can of baked beans so I left out the small can of black beans and did a 28oz. can of black beans instead.  Then I added a bit of ketchup and mustard and called it a day.  This makes a full crock pot full- I fed 30 people and had lots of left overs!

I fixed these as a side dish to a brisket for my husband's birthday.  They were so good the brisket paled in comparison.  My husband asked me to add them to our regular menu as the main dish from now on.  Perfect as is!

This was NOT a hit at our house.  Definitely wish I would have left out the fennel seed. Make sure to leave it out if you do not like black licorice.  I think a dish with a lot of these same ingredients could be really good, but not this exact recipe. I ate it, but it definitely was not "love at first bite" which is what I was hoping for.

OMG these beans are out of this world.  My baked beans have always been good, but these beans rock.  They are my husband’s favorite; he had them for dinner and then lunch the next day and said he wouldn’t mind having them for dinner that night.  I dropped the lima and green beans and substituted other beans I prefer.  I had never used fennel so I  asked my neighbor for a teaspoon of it and liked the flavor will definitely be adding it to my spice rack.  Great recipe and easy.

So easy to make! I took these to a BBQ and was passing out the recipe by the end of the evening. Everyone LOVED them. I did take other suggestions and omitted the green beans. I also used a spicy/tangy BBQ sauce and not a sweet sauce just so they wouldn't be too sweet. Perfect. This is going to be a family keeper.

WOW!  Made it for the holiday and everybody LOVED IT! I made it exactly as is, except regular pork sausage, and no fennel seed or lima beans (my guests hate them!).  It smelled so good that people started digging in before it was even done... and it was still amazing.  We were a little worried about it with all the random beans, but it was amazing.  Thanks for the recipe so I could get all the compliments!

This was tasty. I made it with venison and omitted all but a tiny amount of the green pepper. It was easy and quick and I'll make it again.

I took this to a potluck and it was one of the first dishes to be finished off.  I did make a couple of personal preference changes....I used turkey Italian sausage, cut the brown sugar in half and used both green and yellow peppers.  I also did not use the fennel seed but next time I make it I probably will.  The only reason I left them out was the thought that some would not care for the licorice taste of fennel.

I'm a vegetarian so I left out the sausage that this called for. Following some other reviewers' advice I also cut the brown sugar in half but threw in a jalapeno along with the peppers. I still found this to be too sweet so will probably leave out the brown sugar next time and add some more spices for some zing. Great easy recipe though! Thank you.

Excellent recipe...the only thing I changed was to replace the green beans and wax beans with light and dark kidneys beans and lima beans with a 2nd can of black beans. I made this over the labor day weekend for my families BBQ and it was so hearty and delicious and everyone loved it including all of the kids. I am using the leftovers for chili tonight. This will be the only baked beans I make from now on.

Found this while looking for something to do with beans. The first time I made it I followed the recipe to the letter and from the first bite I knew I found a regular side dish for me (and in fact, have used it as a main dish as well).

I absolutely love it.

Since the first batch I have added 2 ingredients, but this is a personal preference and not necessary.

Minced garlic - simply because I love garlic.

Some heat - in the form of one of Emril's seasoning mixes. Not too much - just enough to add a very slight bite. Again, just because I love a bit of spice.  If you are not a spice lover this could possibly ruin it for you so keep that in mind.

A Must Try Recipe...The only thing different I did was omit 1/4 tsp fennel as we are not real fans of fennel...This is very similiar to calico beans,but better....Thank U so much for this recipe..I will make it often.....

Excellent!  I didn't add the brown sugar, and used a 22 oz can of baked beans since I wanted it to be a little more on the savory vs. sweet side.  I'll def make this again!

I felt these were just "OK" but not a recipe I'd care to repeat.  Too many ingredients, for one thing, that didn't really make sense to me.  Were the edible?  Yes they were but my own baked beans recipe is more to my taste.  Also..........the recipe makes a TON!

This was way more interesting than the usual baked beans.  Sort of an italian chili/baked bean combination of tastes.  I used Italian Sausage, too and didn't bother with the fennel.  My family loved it.

Slight alteration.  I found sausage with fennel in it.  So due to the reviews, I just used that and omitted the 1 tsp seed.  This is really special, easy and delicious...thank you!

This is awesome, it is perfect to take to a picnic or church function.  I skipped the fennel seed, I'm not a fan of the black licorice like flavor of that spice.   Otherwise, followed it exactly.  Super easy and the leftovers warmed up great!

If I could do 1/2 stars I would give this a 3 1/2 rating.

It wasn't what I expected, it is very much what I would call "chili" rather than "baked beans".

The end result isn't bad, but it is quite sweet for my tastes.

In the end, it's not a bad recipe, I just can't rate it higher than 3-4 as it didn't provide me with the baked beans I was looking for.

I DO like the nice variety of beans in it though, very hearty and nutritious.

Definitely a different take on your typical baked beans. I loved all of the different textures and  colors that came from it. My only complaint that I cut the brown sugar in half (we don't like our baked beans too sweet) and it was still way too sweet for us. Next time I will reduce it even more, sub more chili beans for the canned baked beans, and use jalapeno instead of green bell. Oh and I didn't  add the fennel because, well we just don't do fennel.

these were a big hit with my family.  I added half a teaspoon of liquid smoke.  I mentioned that next time I would cut the sugar in half and leave out the fennel but my mom and husband said to leave it as is.  Since my mom and I are diabetic, I used Splenda brand brown sugar.  I think I will double the amount of pork sausage next time.  There will definitely be a next time.

I love recipes that add lots of veggies. This is great for potlucks or big family meals. It's a crowd-pleaser. The only thing I leave out is the lima beans, since a lot of people don't like them, and just use the whole can of BBQ beans instead. I crush the fennel seed with a mortar and pestle before throwing it in.

This was pretty good, but not sure it's worth the effort because it ends up tasting like baked beans.  I added a jalepeno based on some other reviews, which I think was a good addition, it gave it just a touch of bite, but not too much.  I cut the brown sugar in half as suggested, which was also good, it would have been too sweet.  I used a small can of tomato sauce instead of paste, I think I might try diced tomatoes if I make this again.

Just as stated. Was vary good.I will make it my main bean recipe. Will add a little hot sauce to spice it up. Also I found do not add green or yellow beans until the last 30 minutes. Do not break up so fast then.

This was really really good and easy to make! The only thing I did was use 1/2 teaspoon of Fennel Seed instead on 1. I would have to say 1 would have been too much!

It turned out great! I added ground pork to "beef" it up a little, and red pepper for a little color...almost didn't have room in my small crock-pot! This'll be in my regular rotation of meals.

Made this for an employee lunch. Big Hit! I omitted the fennel seed; to me that is a very strong flavor that wouldn't complement baked beans. Also used spicy pork sausage and added the whole 28 oz can of baked beans. I think you could mix and match the types of beans depending on your preference. I like to use all the different kinds of beans called for; makes it a nice colorful dish.

My family loved the combination of beans and the sausage makes all the difference.  Husband thought it could be a little less sweet so I'll cut back on the brown sugar next time, but will surely make it again.  Also, I left out the fennel and didn't miss it a bit.

These beans are the best baked beans I have ever had. It was just spicy enough, just sweet enough, and I just found out that I like lima beans! (very surprising) It's very easy to make. The only change I would make next time would be to halve the fennel, or not put it in at all. It's just a weird flavor when you accidentally bite one in half.
