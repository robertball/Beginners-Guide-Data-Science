I LOVED THIS RECIPE!!! I absolutely hated my stupid cookie press from pampered chef and I found this recipe and it worked! They tasted great too. They were really light and just crumbled in my mouth. Kids loved it too. Definately try this

I love to use this recipe whenever I need a quick, easy cookie!  I found that adding mini-chocolate chips and pecans makes a wonderful addition and my husband can't get enough!  He even came home and told me, "Oh yeah, I told the guys at work how good those cookies were.  They asked if you could make some!"  So I just made a batch of 50 last night!

Not sure if anyone mentioned this tip, but it's easy to tell they're done when they're hard to the touch in the oven.  You're not looking for a golden brown at ALL - just give it a light touch and if they're stiff, you're done!

This is the easiest, best shortbread recipe I have come across.  Worked easily in the cookie shooter.  One hint - spray the decorator tips with PAM-type spray to keep them from sticking to shooter.

These are delicious and melt in your mouth.  A very pretty addition to a cookie tray.  I didn't have any trouble with them being too delicate.  I added 1/4 powdered sugar to make them a bit sweeter.  I added another 1/4 flour or so to get the consistency right for my cookie shooter.  To test the dough's consistency, give it a pinch.  If it doesn't stick to your fingers you're good to go.  I colored one batch green and used a tree stencil for my press.  I decorated with non-pariels (sprinkles that look like tiny, colored balls) and put a star on top for darling Christmas trees.  The other batch I left white and sprinkled with colored sugars. Lovely. UPDATE: My husband proclaimed these the BEST shortbread he's ever tasted!

I found this a great tasting shortbread and nice to work with in a press.  The only recommendation I would suggest, is to keep the dough on the cool side so it breaks off the press easier.

BEST!  and EASY!!  I also added cocoa to half the dough then experimented with putting half white half chocolate down the cookie press.  Then I rolled the white around the chocolate and they made cool patterns in the cookies.  I added 3 TBLS. of the Cocoa and the dough was drier so I'd add a little less next time.  This recipie is definately a keeper!!

I just bought a cookie press specifically for shortbread cookies this holiday season.  I was a little disappointed with this recipe when the dough was so thick it wouldn't go through my brand new cookie press!  I make shortbread every year, but never with a cookie press.  I made the kind you bake whole in a deep pan, then cut into bars.  Anyways, my solution with this one was to add another 1/2 cup of butter.  The cookies needed closer to 13 mins to cook, and in the end I got 4 dozen out of a 2 dozen scaled recipe.  Overall taste was pretty good, but I think this one is more a bar cookie recipe.

I used to be a Pampered Chef consultant.  This recipe does work well with the cookie press but as soon as you are done whipping them up, you need to get them pressed asap.  The discs are in order from easier to most difficult to work with.  I used a #7 (Christmas tree) which was moderate in difficulty to use.  I find that if you give the press a 1/4-1/2 squeeze, then a full squeeze (unti it clicks), the cookie comes out beautifully.  Just make sure to press out all of the dough at one time, use parchment paper if needed.

These cookies were the perfect texture for my cookie press and were a snap to make.  The only bad part was that they didn't have much flavor.  They were kind of bland and powdery instead of buttery.  I made 2 seperate batches and they were consistant in their texture and flavor.  My kids really liked them though.

"Quick"?? No. It took 45 minutes to get the dough together, and 
then the time to press and cook the cookies.
I nearly burned out my mixer trying to get this to blend through. 
The resulting cookies looked like they would be good, but they 
were very dry and bland.

Can you say "Walkers"?  Because these are pretty darn close to that famous Scottish shortbread!  These are more delicate and not as saturated with butter flavor as Walkers, but I actually liked these better.  I had no issues with making them whatsoever and followed the recipe to a "T".  Room temperature butter is essential, I think.   For those who say this is not sweet or does not have much flavor, shortbread is not a sweet cookie.  It is a butter cookie with a hint of sweet.  And I thought the butter flavor came through very well.  I used a cookie press which worked as well with this dough as it does for spritz cookies.  I also rolled some into little balls and pressed them down with my finger making a thick disc.  That also worked well.  Thank you for the shortbread cookie recipe I have been looking for!

This was the first recipe I tried using my new cookie press. I actually halved it because I had never used a press and it turned out great! I added orange zest to the dough and dipped them in chocolate, so melt in your mouth delicious!

Absolutely great recipe.  These were perfect for my cookie press as non-refrigerated/chilled dough works best in mine.  The only change I made was I upped the amount of vanilla to almost a full teaspoon.  Very good cookie and they really do almost melt in your mouth.  I made wreaths and trees with these so I added the green coloring right into the dough and popped them out in a jiffy.  So easy and so good...this one is definitely a keeper for my collection.  Thanks for sharing!

These are my new fave cookies. I put out 4 dozen cookies in less than 15 minutes! (well, not cooked).  My pampered chef press is perfect for this recipe.  I will add a tad more sugar to sweeten them up on the next round, but these cookies are GREAT!!  THANK YOU FOR SHARING THIS RECIPE!!! ~~ I also like that this recipe has no eggs. I didn't mind when I found my kids sneaking tastes of the dough!!~~

I made this recipe to use with my cookie press. Well I gave it a whirl because it looked simple enough, well it was but the taste wasn't that great. So I made a secong batch and used vanilla and granulated sugar in stead and increased it 3/4 cup. Perfect! A little greasy though but I just added powered sugar. I made another batch and crushed pecans in it.

We have never had any cookie press recipe work -  but this one does! One thing that we found is that you can't use parchment paper. You have to put the cookies on a cookie sheet. Did need to add a tiny bit more sugar to get the right consistancy.

recipe was decent.  I prefer the pampered chef recipe..I think they taste a little more buttery and the yield is much higher.

This is a great egg-free cookie press cookie recipe.  They melt in your mouth, delicious little cookies.  We make these for holidays (especially Christmas).    I have had no problems with this dough.  Note to those who have struggled:  Sometimes I think people don't wait long enough for the butter/sugar to cream together before adding in the flour.  It should be well incorporated, fluffy before the flour is added.  I usually do use my hands to bring it together in the end - massage it a little and add to the cookie press.  Don't despair if you have crumbs; just massage it, it will come together and you'll be able to make them.

These turned out nicely. Very brittle, but it melts in your mouth. It has a subtle sweet flavor and everyone enjoyed them.

I found the taste of this recipe very good: very buttery and not overly sweet. I did add a pinch of salt as I find in general that it helps bring out the flavor in pastry. The texture is very smooth with a delicate crispiness. As other reviewers have noted it does give a rather fragile cookie. Worth it though n my opinion.  For me this recipe is not very well suited for the cookie press: much too sticky even after putting the dough in the fridge for about 15 minutes. In the second batch I added 50 g more flour but the dough was still too sticky for the press. Perfect for rolling balls by hand and flatting them a bit on the cookie sheet.  Will definitely make this recipe again because of the texture and taste, just not with the press. Therefor on 4 out of 5 stars.

SO good!  These are so easy to make- once you know how to operate a cookie press- in fact, I considered throwing mine out the window until these came out of the oven and I tried one-- they just gave my cookie press a new hope! Delicious!

This is a very good and easy recipe. Keep in mind it's shortbread, not the standard sugar cookie - some of my guests expected a different texture. These are light, buttery, and wonderful with a cup of tea!

Worked great in my press, even with coloring added.  Watch cooking time closely or the cookies are very crumbly.

Excellent.  However this recipe does not take 25 min of prep work!  I had made the dough, filled the press, and had cookies baking within 10 minutes.  Absolutely excellent and very tasty!!!

The cookies came out of the press really nicely, but they are a bit bland.  Even tried adding some extra vanilla and cinnamon, but they still don't taste great.

Dry and flavorless! I've no doubt it's on account of the 1/2 cup of cornstarch. I've just wasted 2 sticks of butter on this recipe. NOT worth it.

We found the taste and consistency of these cookies to be just awful. I think the half cup of cornstarch was just too much.

I had my doubts about this recipe after reading the ingredients, but my hubby and I liked them a lot.  Instead of stirring in the flour and cornstarch, I kneaded them in with my hands.  It was very quick to make.  I took one pan out after 9 minutes and they were totally white.  The other pan I left in for about 2 more minutes til they were light brown on the edges.  I thought these tasted best.  They are very fragile!

I just started using this recipe last year, but my girlfriends said I'm not allowed at their holiday parties this year unless I bring these with me! I added some peppermint oil and food coloring to these to give them a different flavor, since they are truly very bland. I love the texture, but my hubby hates it, so they're either a love or hate there. They are buttery and crumbly, which I love. Plus yes, super easy.

First rate cookies!  Just the right texture--my English husband even likes them!  I added about a tsp ground rosemary to every batch, which provided some depth to the flavor, plus the smell throughout the house was outstanding!  Great recipe!

Delicious and so easy!  Perfect holiday recipe to do with young kids because there aren't too many ingredients.  They just came out of the oven and are melt in your mouth.  This one is definitely going to be a Christmas regular.

This worked only with the ribbon disk of my Pampered Chief cookie press.  They were fantastic!  They weren't hard and crumbly like ones I've made before.  I drizzled them with two different kinds of chocolate but they would have been fine alone.  I made sure to touch them when they were done.  They were completely white but firm to the touch with only a slight springiness.  Perfect!

"Quick"?? No. It took 45 minutes to get the dough together, I nearly burned out my mixer and then the time to press" TIPS - butter must be SOFT. Add flour gradually. If too stiff for mixer, finish mixing flour by hand.You might  need a little less flour, because butter varies in amount of water it contains.  Shortbread has buttery taste, & using confectionery sugar & corn starch should give a melt-in-your-mouth texture.

Melt-in-your-mouth good!  Very fragile though.  I packed them in little baggies, dropped one, and it all but disintegrated.  Well, let's hope they make them half way around the world because I included them in my husbands care package.

Wonderful! I added almond flavor and turbinado sugar to the top. The day after is best once the moisture "equalizes". These are buttery and super light.

I have tried dozens upon dozens of recipes for my stupid pampered chef cookie press and this one made me literally jump up and down in my kitchen from excitement because it actually worked! I've made this recipe twice now and it's bookmarked in my browser.  The only thing I tweaked was I substituted almond extract for the vanilla. I think it helped round out the flavor of the butter better.

I just tried it...The dough isn't quite sticky enough to stick to the cookie sheets so I could use some of my shapes with it but not all of them. Overall it tastes good and makes a decent cookie you just have to work with the dough for a bit to get it to stick to the cookie sheet.

This recipe was really disappointing. I was really excited to use my cookie press for the first time. These cookies formed really nicely but when I took them out and sampled one, they tasted awful. They were bitter and tasted like flour. I had even added a bit more sugar than called for.

These shortbread cookies are pretty tasty and addicting. Once you get your hands on them you can hardly stop yourself! I have been looking for a way to utilize my cookie press a little better and this is the perfect way! I am pretty happy with how these little babies turned out, but I think there are some parts that can definitely be improved.  For example, the taste of these shortbread cookies are a bit plain and bland, and almost too buttery. I felt like I was going to die from a heart attack after munching on ~5 of them, and I am only in my early 20s! I think next time I will try adding some more sugar and vanilla and see if that makes it taste better. The dough is also a bit sticky so it took me a while to get it in the press and repeat that process over and over again. The cookies also feel a little bit too delicate; I had to be very careful when I removed them all into my tableware. I will probably also add a fair amount of flour next time to fix the consistency in addition to the "too buttery" problem.   I doubled the recipe to make 4 dozens, but I ended up getting way more than 4 dozens. I tried to count but I sort of lost track; I am pretty sure I had around 10 dozens though. But then again my cookies were a bit cutesy tiny. Anyways, this recipe is definitely a keeper!

Perfect shortbread recipe! Just be careful they can get over cooked fast! One min you think they need to be in a bit longer and then the next you wished you would have checked sooner!

This was yummy!  Don't expect a sugar cookie though - this is definately a shortbread.  I found my cookies were too thin with the cookie press.  This would be yummy baked as bars of shortbread though!

This is the recipe I have been looking for for a very long time. My mother had one just like it and I lost it during a move. Had to find one very close to it and this is it. Was raised on them and will never again loose this recipe. Best ever Send it on to your freinds and family, they will agree.

This cookie is delicious!  I've made it twice in the last week for Christmas gatherings and gifts.  They are so light and buttery.  This is defintely a keeper.  I don't have a cookie press.  I used an accent decorator by Pampered chef.  It worked like a charm.  I did not change a thing in the recipe.  I don't know what people did that resulted in a "floury" cookie.  May be they didn't measure their dry goods acurately.  They are so quick to whip up.  Thanks Heather!

This was my first time using a cookiepress and so I tried out this recipe--it worked wonderfully. The cookies had a  light, delicate texture but a satisfyingly rich flavor. They rival the shortbread my aunt from Scotland makes--and hers is the gold standard!

Very delicious.  Qty of the  Only ingredient I modified was sugar. I reduced to 1/4 cup  instead of 1/2 cup and I used brown sugar. Came out perfect.   Everyone in the family loved it.  happY holidays and thank you for sharing such  simple and tasty recipe.

This recipe worked okay in my pampered chef cookie press We sprayed the press disc first which helped a lot. The taste is not great. Very bland. We had fun any way even if they weren’t that great.

Made this pretty much to the T minus adding a hint more vanilla & powdered sugar, due to previous comments saying they "lack flavor". Well....they look great/beautiful.!! They hold their shape, but "lack flavor".  Very easy to make which is a huge plus! I just need to find a way to add some 'it's a cookie flavor'!!! I really wanted to LOVE these. (Pic Added)

These were quick and easy.  I used a Wilton bite size cookie press and baked the cookies for 5 min. I also used 1 tsp of vanilla.  They came out great!

Loved this recipe, they just melt in your mouth. The only reason it didn't get five stars is that it needed more vanilla. It's even better with some almond extract.

Ok so I added 3/4 cup confectioner's sugar and I also used a full 2 teaspoons of vanilla exctract and 1/2 tsp of almond extract...The other thing I did as a result of reading other reviews is I whipped the butter for a full 2-3 minutes until it was really fluffy and almost white. I then added the confectioner's sugar and both extracts and continued whipping for another 3 minutes...the whole thing was almost white in color and then I added the flour and cornstarch. I whipped another 2-3 minutes and everything was very white and fluffy. I then divided the dough into 3 bowls, added red food coloring to one and green food coloring to the other. I used the cookie press,  after making sure each bowl was mixed well...I ended up with green cookies, red cookies and white cookies that we ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!! make this recipe, let them cool completely on parchment-lined cookies sheets before even trying to remove them. You will not be disappointed, they are awesome. I am definitely making more, because while I got almost 40 small cookies, they were still not plentiful enough. I had a rough time keeping my daughter and husband (and yes, even myself) away from them!

These turned out gorgeous the first time I tried them - today - in my wonderful Marcato biscuit maker.  I actually put slightly more cornstarch in them because I added lemon jest to the creamed butter and sugar and used 1/2 teaspoon fresh lemon juice and 1/4 teaspoon lemon extract instead of vanilla (I was hungry for lemon cookies).  These cookies went through my press easily without refrigeration and are so tender I actually broke two while taking them off the pans.  This is a keeper and I will make them again!

This was my first time making spritz cookies and I must say, the dough worked very well with the cookie press. The cookies kept their shape wonderfully! These were almost shortbread like with how delicate they were and just seemed to dissolve in your mouth as you ate them, but they were kinda dry. Also, the flavor is what I had the most trouble getting past. There wasn't a lot of taste to these cookies and they kinda left a little bit of an aftertaste in my mouth. I will say, some of my family absolutely loved them, but I feel like there is room for improvement.

Wonderfully easy to work with! Added a bit more extract for flavor. Great flaky texture.

I only gave the recipe 4 stars, because, as is, the dough was too crumbly to use in my cookie press. However, I mixed in one tablespoon of milk and then it was perfect. They baked beautifully and tasted great, with a good shortbread texture. With the milk added, it's a 5 star recipe.

Cookies looked very nice, they formed well with my cookie press. Cookies themselves were a little chalky. Good cookie for the low # of ingredients. Next time I will substitute half of the cornstarch for rice flour.

We are having a 'When life gives you lemons' sermon at church so I decided to make these and I tripled the recipe and I added lemon extract along with lemon zest and juice and a little bit more flour to compensate the extra liquid. I chilled my dough for a little bit so it would come out easier in the press. So good!! 
FYI...any dough is good enough if you know what you're doing when it comes to baking. If you don't know, I would suggest reading reviews for tips.

My family loves this  cookie so much, to speed up the process, I even just roll them in balls, flatten them,  sprinkle sugar on top and bake them as little round cookies.  Great tasting recipe.

I have fond memories of my mother in law (who just turned 90) making her Xmas shortbread. She would beat the butter with a wood spoon for a long time, add the flour and cornstarch  and then nead it as she walked round the house :)  This recipe is just like her shortbread only much easier to make. The secret is beating the butter and sifting the flour and neading it with your hands. It worked perfectly in my cookie press. Those who found it dry and crumbly over cooked  it. It shouldn't look brown. 8 min was enough for mine.   It improves in taste as it ages if you can keep it long enough without eating it all.

Agree with another reviewer that "these cookies were the perfect texture for my cookie press and were a snap to make. The only bad part was that they didn't have much flavor."  They look beautiful, but they weren't sweet at all. I will use a different spritz butter cookie recipe next time.

I didn't care for this recipe.  I followed the instructions and it turned out to be very dry.   I added water and it was so thick it broke my cookie press.  Maybe I should have used melted butter.

Husband and friends liked this. Took some to a function and everyone seemed to enjoy them. Some of the comments...oh you can tell these are not store bought, wow these melt in the mouth, these are so good. 
I didn't care for the chalky texture left behind by all the cornstarch. However I am a shortbread snob. :)

I love, love, love this recipe - like many, it helped me have a new relationship with my cookie press :-) I made them tree-shaped with green food colouring for son's class event. Can't wait to use it again! Only note of caution: they brown easily, so watch them closely. Mine only needed 6 minutes.

They do melt in your mouth, like other reviewers say. They do not have much flavor but I knew that going in.). They leave a floury taste in  your mouth afterwards.

I made one batch without any changes to the recipe, they were not bad and they weren't great either. Dough did go through the cookie press just fine though.  For the remaining dough I folded in another 1/2t of vanilla, 1/2 cup of confectioners sugar and a cap full of vegetable oil.  Then baked again it it was so much better.

I wish I could give 2.5 I made this for my press because I wanted a short bread cookie, not just your regular spritz cookie. Only change to the recipe was to use home made icing sugar, as I realized I didn't have any in the pantry. Dough turned out ok, was hard to get the cookies to stick to the pan out of the spritzer though. 

When I baked them however, they refused to keep their shape. Not even remotely did they keep their shape. They ended up turning into Cookie Chips. Literally. I tried putting the dough in the refrigerator, and I tried making balls instead of the spritz cookies and they still turned into cookie chips. They tasted good but they certainly did not look good. Maybe I will try this again for Valentines day or something.

This recipe is super simple to make and works perfectly with my cookie press. The flavor is light and buttery, perfect topped with sugar or iced, but also good plain. The taste and texture is best a day after baking and is lovely with a glass of champagne!

Better than my moms family recipe.  Don't be afraid to whip the heck out of it, the more you whip it the better it will work with a cookie press. Absolutely amazing melt in your mouth shortbread!!! 5 out of 5

I followed the recipe to a T and the cookies came out bland and crumbly. So the next batch I added just a bit of sherry to make the dough more pliable and sprinkled chopped pecans on top.   Still bland and crumbly.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was very dry and bland -no flavor whatsoever . My family didn't like them either.  The texture of the dough was ok-a little odd, but worked with my press.  Very chalky cookie though-I will not be making this again.

These turned out extremely well even though I was 2 about tablespoons shy of the full cup of butter.  I baked them a little longer so they were lightly browned, melt in your mouth morsels.  I used the leftover dough to make regular cookies by rolling them into balls and pressing them down.  If you don't have a cookie press, these make great butter cookies.

This is the best recipe I found yet for my cookie press.  Came out perfect!

I rated it a 4 due to the concerns I read about the "bland-ness" of the cookies.  To compensate, I increased the vanilla to 1/2 t and added 1 t of lemon extract.  YUMMY!!!!!!!

Best. Recipe. Ever. It's super easy due to the short list of ingredients, yet the cookies turn out beautifully. A tip: use unsalted butter for the light and fluffy, melt-in-your-mouth texture, and go for a quality brand that will help the cookies maintain their shape when baked. I've tried this recipe with many different brands of butter, and the cheaper ones tend to be thinner and the resulting cookie dough needs either a little more flour, or a little longer baking time at lower temperature to maintain their shape without getting burnt. Oh and I've added twists of lemon zest for a twist of flavour, but since I used a cookie press, lemon essence works better unless you can be bothered chopping the lemon zest very very finely :)

I agree with those saying it wasn't very tasty. The taste was off, perhaps I was tasting the cornstarch I don't know. If I try this again I'll up the sugar and consider more toppings besides the crystals. 

The recipe worked great through my Norpro cookie press yielded around 30+ cookies with two complete fills of the press though.

I tried this recipe today.  Sorry to say all I could taste was the corn starch, and my mouth immediatly went dry.  My neighbor tried one and didn't care for it either. 
I tried this to see if it worked in the cookie press better than the recipe I first tried. The dough was great, made lovely Christmas cookies, but I just don't care for the flavor.

I used this as my first cookie press recipe - and they pressed great! I didn't play around with ingredients on my first try, just wanted to see how they would work out. I used unsalted butter and wished I'd tossed in a pinch of salt to balance out the flavour a bit. They are nice and soft and melt in your mouth - but they are a little floury tasting. I think I might try a bit of a blend with a different flour, like rice, on my next try. Lots of compliments on them, though - thanks for the recipe!

This was a great recipe.  I have tried quite a few that were made for cookie presses, but none measure up to this one.  Gonna make tons of these for Christmas.  I substituted half of the corn starch for arrowroot as I have a bunch of arrowroot left over from another recipe.

Awesome recipe! Easily comes out of the cookie press. It could use a little more flavor, and I did notice they took longer than 8-10 minutes to cook. But they look beautiful and the texture is great!

This was a wonderful recipe!!  The dough was fast and worked great in my cookie press.  The cookies were delicious and looked so pretty.  I'll be making some of these, drizzled with melted chocolate, for our Christmas cookie exchange and I can't wait.

I thought this was fabulous. The dough worked perfectly in my Williams Sonoma cookie press. Quick and easy to make, buttery and melt-in-your mouth good. These are like the holiday cookies I grew up with. I get closer to 4 dozen from the 2-dozen scaled recipe, I guess that is because of the size of the press? Will make many more to decorate and to freeze.

I was looking for a cookie press dough and stubled onto this one. I doubled the batch and it is a good thing I did. My wife and kids gobbled these down as fast as I got them out of the oven and cooled. 
This is an EXTREMELY fragile cookie. I had to slide them off the sheet but they absolutely melt in your mouth. These dissolve so fast we could actually let out 9 month old try them. (he wanted seconds and thirds too)
I made white stars and green trees but I would be shocked if they last 'til Christmas.

The dough is a dream for a cookie press!  Quick and easy.  I think on a scale from 1-10 on taste, these cookies rate a 6 in my opinion.
