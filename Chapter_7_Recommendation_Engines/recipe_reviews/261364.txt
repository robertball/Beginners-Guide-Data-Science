Absolutely delicious! I'll be making this often. Now, I did change the procedure a bit because it seemed a little backwards to me and I didn't want to dirty two saucepans and a skillet when just the skillet would suffice. So, instead of the order prescribed I cooked the drumsticks in the skillet FIRST, removed them, then sauteed the onions/chickpeas/rice in the same pan and poured the stock/thyme directly into the pan before adding the chicken back in and popping it into the oven with a lid on it. I did, however, omit the second addition of salt/pepper/cayenne because I felt 1 teas of each was sufficient and it was still extremely rich and flavorful with just a bit of heat . I served it with a dollop of sour cream to cut the spiciness and it was heaven!
