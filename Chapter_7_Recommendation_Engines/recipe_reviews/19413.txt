I had a lot of fun making this dish - and the results were good.  I guess the prep time (for me) was a little more than what's suggested here, but the cooking time was right-on.   I did the prep a little ahead of time, so that when company came (and we were having drinks) I was able to turn the water on to boil... then toss the chicken in the pant... etc.  In short, it was a great (easy) dinner to prepare while people were over.  The meal itself?  Terrifc flavors.  Will definitely do this one again.  Word to the wise:  This is filling - so don't make your servings too big (like I did)... Also, my partner thought the chicken was bland.  (I didn't...)  So, keep that in mind when preparing the chicken.  I thoroughly enjoyed this dish, however - everything about it... the taste, as well as the appearance.  A+

everyone enjoyed this.  I added artichokes and substituted grape tomatoes for sundried.  since there alot of mediterranean flavors here, i marinaded the chicken in greek dressing and Cavender's greek seasoning first.  Chicken came out very tasty.  To make more of a sauce to coat the noodles i added chicken stock and a small amount of tomato sauce at the end. Great recipe!

This pasta was good; however, I do recommend making w/the chicken as the recipe calls for.  I didn't have any and made it vegetarian style.  I also didn't have basil and replaced w/oregano and didn't have parsley and had to leave out.  Had I had all of the ingredients I believe this would have been very good!  Nonetheless, I would definitely add twice the green onion, garlic and olive oil it calls for to add more of a robust flavor.

This was a great meal. Make sure when you cook the chicken that its in small bites. I made the mistake of making them a little big and so it was hard. Also i think i would of changed the noodles to soemthing smaller, because it was very filling. I really liked this recipe, and i dont like chicken or olives. I was orignaly going to take out the olives but at the last second i kept them in. They help with the taste and you can always do what i did, put them to the side. Try it, see what you think.

Nice flavor combinations.  I also added green olives - my daughter gobbled it up!  Thanks for a simple keeper for busy weeknights!

I made this last night and it was delicious! I used angel hair pasta, doubled the garlic, more olive oil (eyeballed it), 1/4 cup parmesan cheese, and added artichoke hearts...very tasty!

This is a dish I make sure I always have the ingredients on hand for.  My kids love it!  I do go heavier with the garlic (about 3 cloves ) and parmesan (double).  Overall, this is an easy meal with reliably tasty results.

This is fabulous!  The only ingredient I didn't have was fresh parsley; but I did have fresh basil so used that instead of the dried this calls for.  And all I had was canned chicken, but it still turned out WONDERFUL.  I threw in a little Italian seasoning to help the chicken along.  A great & easy combo of flavors.  I will definitely try other stuff with it like green olives & feta cheese, etc.  My hubby said, "You DID keep this recipe, right!?"  "Yes, dear."

Delicious. My husband said he'd eat it every day. The instructions didn't say to add oil to cook the chicken, but I added half. I used garlic infused oil and regular olive oil - didn't have a whole garlic. The instructions also didn't say to chop the sun-dried tomatoes but I did. Substituted a few tablespoons of chipped fresh basil for the dried basil and parsley. When I buy parsley I end up wasting most of it and it's irritating to chop. (Did I admit that?)

Quick and easy. I also used green olives, lots of garlic too. Added some frozen peas to the pasta in the last couple of minutes it cooked. Also added some pesto.
Flexible recipe.

This rocked my universe - used green olives instead of black (just what I had), feta and threw mine over a big bowl of lettuce (I'm chubby).  My husband had his over pasta (he's skinny - I think there's a nursery rhyme about us) and loved it!  Best meal in a long time!

My family was skeptical, but ate it all! I did add some green olives with the black and was pleased with the result.

This recipe was delicious and easy! So many flavors bursting in your mouth. Feel free to add other delicious vegetables to this recipe. Adding Italian seasoning made it even better.
