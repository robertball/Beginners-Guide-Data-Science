This is definitely up there in terms of frosting for cookies-- frankly, its the only stuff I use--I've made this 3 or 4 times now.  I make this with the recipe on this site: "The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies" and it is just fantastic!  If you aren't a big fan of sweet stuff, however, I would suggest halving this recipe-- this really makes way more than necessary for that recipe.  If you are a big fan of sweet stuff, however-- glop it on!  I seriously suggest putting in the shortening, then slowly adding the powdered sugar about half a cup at a time.  Once it starts clumping up, add the milk/ etc, then add more sugar if you want to make it a bit thicker.  I've found that if it gets too clumpy, it won't dissolve the clumps, and you have to smooth it out with a spatula, which takes forever.

Sugar cookie icing is really a matter of personal taste, so I can understand this not agreeing with everyone. However, I though this was the BEST SUGAR COOKIE ICING I'VE EVER MADE! I've tried the confectionary sugar recipes a dozen different ways and they always come out sickly sweet. Just keep it a scant measure of the shortening, and whip it up real well and this icing is fantastic. Not only that, but it held up well enough that I could pack these up and pass them out. Everyone who tried my cookies loved this icing.

Delicious!! I used this icing on the Easy Sugar Cookies and it was a huge hit with everyone.  I used unsalted butter instead of shortening though, it gives a much better flavor to the icing.  The one time I used shortening the icing dried fairly quickly and I was able to put all the cookies in layers (with tinfoil in between) within 15 minutes of icing them.  If you want to add sprinkles or anything to the top of the icing be sure to do that right away or they won't stick!  If you use butter, the cookies will stick together if you stack them but there's no trans fats!

Halved the recipe and used butter instead of shortening. Great and easy.  My daughter had a blast adding food coloring and decoring cookies.  Using this for this season's batch of holiday cookies. Thanks Kathy.

This was a good cookie frosting, but not exactly what I was looking for. My husband said it was too sweet, but the kids and I loved the sweetness.  However, I was on the hunt for more of a glaze/icing that would be stackable. The frosting was thick and was more like a frosting for a cake.  It was yummy though and easy to handle.

I liked this recipe because I often use royal icing.  The cream of tartar gives it that twinge and its not very good with a sugar cookie.  So this was a better choice.  I also added some Wilton's white white. It makes it perfectly white.  If you add a little glycerine it comes out glossy ;)  thanks!

This frosting was fantastic! Finally I have found a cookie frosting that is thicker, and hardens, and its tastey. Thanks so much for the recipe!

I have been searching for the "perfect" frosting recipe - the search is over - this is IT! It's easy to make, tastes great, easy to apply and dries hard (but not as hard as royal frosting).

This was a great frosting.  Just the right consistency, easy to spread, slightly shiny.  I used butter in place of the shortening, and I also added some lemon extract which I highly recommend.

I've used this recipe for about 20 years.  I think I got it from an old Pillsbury cookbook my mom had when I was a kid growing up.  Super easy!  I whip the shortening in my mixer for a minute and then add the powdered sugar gradually.  I mix the vanilla in the milk so it gets evenly distributed.  I add the milk after I've added about two cups of sugar and then add the remaining sugar to the desired consistency.  I divide it in little bowls and color.  I usually make a double batch when we make Christmas cookies and be sure to save some white for Santa's beard and snowmen!

Some of the other reviews said this recipe dries hard.  Mine didn't.  One batch of ruined bake sale cookies later I have to start with a new recipe.  If you are going to go ahead and use this recipe I would suggest less shortening and also substituting butter.

PERFECT! I used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup shortening for flavor. The best part was that the icing dried enough to stack them, but didn't actually dry out. Definitely my go-to recipe now when I need frosting for cookies!

This is the best basic cookie frosting. Just change out extracts for different flavors (starting at 1/2 tsp to taste)and add your food coloring. Great for decorating, the frosting set up nicely after a few hours, SLOWLY add more milk if it is too thick to get the consistency you want. Just remeber this is not a glaze it is a frosting!*** Just a quick update I use this recipe but now only do about half the confectioners sugar. Not to sweet just enough to compliment the cookie with out the frosting being the only thing you taste. I first cream my shortening (smart balance is transfat free) then add the sugar. when It turns crumbly I slowly add the milk to the consistency I am looking for.

This frosting was excellent on the soft sugar cookies from this site.  I used water instead of milk so i could leave it out of the fridge.  It hardened up nicely and tastes similar to the filling of an oreo.  Will definately use again.

This frosting is wonderful! I split this recipe & made half with vanilla and the other half with almond--both were delicious! I can't wait to try it again with lemon. A+!!
PS-when combining the shortening & confectioners sugar, mine did not take on a creamy texture--but don't be discouraged, go ahead and add the milk & it turns out fine. :)

This was very good.  I tried it exactly as written, then I tried it with butter instead and added a dash of salt.  Much better the 2nd way.  Sets well.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used this icing on "Easy Sugar Cookies" and it tastes great. I used butter for the icing instead of shortening and cut the recipe in half (we had just enough icing to generously ice 3 dozen cookies).

This frosting is lick your fingers, spatula and bowl good - and exactly as written save for using clear vanilla and adding a pinch of salt.  But I can't stress enough how important it is to use hi-ratio shortening, easily available online, for superior quality.

It was a great base to begin with, easy, fast and no fuss. and it tastes great! I only used 3 cups of confectioner's sugar and swapped the shortening for butter. I also left out some milk using only 4 tbsp. I am making this my new go to frosting. the vanilla flavor is very prominent so if you are wanting to add an extract I would half the vanilla. enjoy!

EXCELLENT!  I used butter-flavored shortening and it came out perfectly.  Dried on the cookies just right so I could stack them.  Tasted delicious!

This is my go-to icing recipe for sugar cookies! It is perfect because it sets well, and allows you to stack cookies in a container without messing up the icing. It tastes great too!

I was very disappointed in this frosting.  1-it tastes awful...tastes like shortening. 2- it doesn't harden up enough to be able to stack the cookies without them smearing and making a mess.

Love this recipe!  A couple little tweaks I use though... unsalted butter in place of the shortening, and add 1/8 tsp Almond Extract -the almond gives the frosting such a nice hint of added flavor.  Most people who try them love the flavor but can't quite put their finger on the reason they love it...it's the almond!  :)

very good recipe.  Didn't have shortening on-hand and used butter and still turned out great.  Used coloring and made  Valentine's cookies.  My boys loved it!

Loved this frosting on the Sugar Cookie Cutouts from this website. It makes a ton, so I halfed the amount and had enough to ice 3 dozen cookies. I also used half vanilla and half almond extract as a personal preference.

This frosting was awesome, I used it with Delilah's cut-out sugar cookies and I think it made the cookie. I used butter instead of shortening, I only had butter flavored and didn't want the frosting to be yellowish (thanks cammysauce!) for my ghost cookies. At first the frosting seemed to separate a bit, but I was in a hurry making it and don't think I beat the sugar in slowly enough to let it mix well. I made half of it orange for pumpkin cookies and they looked great, the frosting was super easy to work with. At one point it seemed to separate more so I micro'd it for a couple seconds and the cookies after that were super glossy and dried really quickly. They ones I frosted thick took a while to dry completely, I left them out overnight and by morning they were perfect!

This was a very good recipe. I prefer butter to shortening and used salted sweet cream in place of the unhealthy trans fats of shortening. I would note to slowly add in the milk. For those who did not like the consistency of the icing, it is easy to make it thicker or thinner by simply adding more/less milk. I used this on top of soft sugar cookies, and I had no problem stacking the cookies on top of each other. You just need to give the icing an hour or so to dry completely. As a final note, I decided I wanted some color and additional flavor and added cinnamon to half of the batch and 1 TBSP of an instant lemon pudding mix to the other. Both turned out delicious and pretty.

I thought this frosting was really good! It complimented "The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies" recipe very well. At first I thought it was going to be more of a glaze, but it's more like cake frosting, but does dry fast enough that I could stack them without making a mess, while still not tasting dry at all, which was great! I brought the cookies to a family get-together and everyone had at least two or three!

I followed the recipe exactly and ended up with a bunch of sugar left over.  With the addition of more milk, it took on a frosting consistency; however, the vanilla extract seemed pretty strong tasting.  It was okay, but I'm not sure if I'll make this again.

This recipe is AWESOME!  I will never use another frosting recipe again, this is the one I've been looking for!  I used 1/2 & 1/2 (all I had) and real butter!  I'm wondering if those who colored their frosting used color paste or food coloring.  I used food coloring and didn't get a deep red like I would have liked.  Would someone who has used paste please comment?

This frosting is excellent.  I used butter instead of shortening and it tasted awesome.
I used this frosting with the Easy Sugar Cookies recipe and everyone loved them.  You will not be disappointed if you make this frosting.

This is the perfect sugar cookie frosting! Sweet and creamy and it sets up enough so you can stack them without smearing the designs. Yet it is still soft when you bite into the cookie. I substituted the vanilla for almond extract. You could probably use lemon as well. I also used butter instead of shortening.

This turned out exactly as I had hoped. The icing tastes delicious, and it dries just enough to where you can stack the cookies without them sticking together. I used butter flavored Crisco, and was happy with the result. I can finally make powdered sugar icing!

I loved this recipe!! It is amazing!!!  I did half and half of the vanilla and then die the other half with maple!!  They tasted like maple bars!  I have made it with both butter and with shortening and I prefer the butter.  I used butter flavored Crisco and it tasted too much like shortening and left a funny film in my mouth!!

UMMMM... works perfectly to describe this frosting. it spread so easily and didn't make the cookies soggy. the one problem i had was i couldn't get enough of it, it was too delicious. I made a batch of cookies, whipped up the frosting and took them to a christmas party and within the hour they were gone every single cookie was devoured. Perfect for any cookie in my opinion. :)

We used this recipe exactly as it was written.  It turned out great and we've never made cookie frosting before.  We colored it using Wilton icing colors.  

It was pretty easy to work with.  We used some in icing piping bag with a small round tip, and some we spread on with a knife and sprinkled with colored sugar.

We left the decorated cookies out on the counter overnight and in the morning it was dry enough to be able to stack the cookies without ruining them.  They turned out beautifully and was still soft and yummy to eat.

THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS RECIPE!

I used butter and was out of milk so I had to use half and half.  Rich and YUMMY!!!!!  This frosting is sooo good.  
Takes color well IF you are using professional colors not the crummy ones you get at the grocer.

My 10 year old daughter and I found this to be an excellent cookie frosting.  I added 1/2 tsp. of almond extract but other than that I followed the recipe.  The frosting dried enough to stack the cookies with no problem.  Kids will love this!

Pretty good, and easy to make even without a mixer. I used butter flavored shortening, which makes the frosting a creamy colour that I think is pretty :) Didn't bother with food colouring; sprinkled with coloured sugar right away, and then the frosting dried up just enough to stack the cookies which makes it much easier to pass them out to friends!

Maybe because I used butter instead of the shortening (like others), but this recipe did not turn out for me at all! Appeared very runny, and even after beating 5 minutes it was still a runny gloppy mess. Because I was pressed for time, I sent my husband to the store and buy the canned frosting. My personal opinion is that 5 tablespoons of milk is way too much...maybe it should be 5 TEAspoons?

This was a two thumbs up!! I usually use the butter frosting recipe that comes listed on the powdered sugar. This was so much better. For some reason my sugar cookies, didn't turn out as good as usual, but this definitely made it. I will never use that crummy buttercream frosting recipe again.

Oh lord this was awful. My friend and I googled "Easy Sugar Cookie Frosting" and clicked on this thinking it was simple... and edible. Oh boy were we wrong. First of all, we didn't have "shortening" so we subsituted it for butter. After reading some reviews, I have come to the conclusion that this was a bad idea. Second, the recipe wasn't very clear on how to mix the ingredients. Should you decide to make this, use shortening, MUCH less sugar than called for (let's be realistic, 4 cups of sugar is too much for anyone), and do not beat too much. Our frosting seemed to have a bunch of clumps of sugar, so we mixed it with an electric mixer on "Whip." This made it into a weird liquidy consistensy. So, long story short: don't make this recipe and pick something alot more edible. Unless of course you like frosting that tastes like overly buttery, sickly sweet toothpaste. Lastly, we named our frosting "The Nuclear Hazard," which should give you an idea of the quality...

I made this with butter instead of shortening, knowing that because of this, it wouldn't harden up enough to stack the cookies, but it didn't matter because it tasted SO good!  I added a little lemon extract and yellow food coloring to the recipe, and used it to frost the Easy Sugar Cookies recipe from this site, to which I also added some lemon extract, and while not super-lemony tasting, it gave it a little "something" special....this is one of the best frosted cookies I've ever made!

I used Butter instead of crisco. And instead of milk I used heavy cream. It was delish!

There is nothing "special" about this frosting, that being said there's nothing much here to improve. Tried and true! I mixed it up a bit - I made my cookies with some GROUND CLOVE and CINNAMON - Then for the frosting I replaced 3/4 of the MILK with EGGNOG then sprinkled NUTMEG on top! Next time I might even split the MILK and EGGNOG HALF & HALF

Meh. The flavour was good -- not too sweet -- but it was hard to colour this icing. I had to add several more tablespoons of milk to get it to a piping consistency, and found that the shortening melted in the bag as a piped, leaving white streaks in the coloured icing. Not quite the look I was going for. 
I would definitely use this again for baking projects that involve only white icing, but I don't recommend this for colouring, unless you have ice-cold hands!

I used this recipe to decorate Halloween cookies and rolled out Pillsbury sugar cookie dough, used a pumpkin cookie cutter, let cool and added this icing.
The only CHANGE that I made was to used butter in lieu of shortening.  It came out real "pearly" and shiny....simply gorgeous!  The toddlers in my daughters wee school and the trick or treaters are gonna love 'em!

GREAT!!!  Will be using this at Christmas too.  Only change I made was using butter instead of the shortening but that was only because I didn't have any.  Worked out so well, I'm gonna keep using the butter.

Absolutely delicious.  This frosting is light anf fluffy, and a dab adds just the right amount of sweetness to sugar cookies.  One note:  I used the whisk attachment on my mixer and whipped the icing very well for lightness.

Easy to make, great consistancy, and very very good taste.  I couldn't get shortening here so I used butter.  It still looked white.  I used it for my sugar cookies and had enough left to frost a loaf of gingerbread, so if you're not making too much, 1/2 the recipe.

Delicious!  It turned out great.  I used butter shortening instead.  It works great with the "Soft Christmas Cookies" recipe.  It was the right amount to frost all of them and a little to spare for tasting :)  A keeper!

Very good frosting, turned out perfect and easy too.  I added a tablespoon of butter and 1/2 a teaspoon of extra vanilla for extra taste. I think this frosting could also be used on cakes.  I will definately add this to my collection.  Thanks so much for sharing Kathy.

I never thought the day would come when I would say this, because I LOVE sugar, but this icing was a little too sweet.  However, it does have a good consistency and does dry firm.

I won't be making this again, purely because of the taste. It whipped up nicely, frosted nicely, and hardened properly for transporting cookies, but just didn't taste very good. Also, I used gel food coloring, and it seperated after awhile, which usually doesn't happen. I suspect that it was because of the shortening, rather than using butter as I usually do.

Very good recipe. Took the advise of another review and added the milk once the shortening and confectioners' sugar got too lumpy, then added the rest of the sugar. I added Almond flavoring instead of vanilla and it turned out great! Great consistency, easy to work with.

I used this recipe, but halved everything except vanilla then added powdered sugar until it was the right texture. Still made plenty of frosting for 18 cookies of about medium size. Didn't turn out as white as i thought, it's more of a beige but again I did fiddle with the vanilla and powdered sugar proportions so that could be why.

I made this recipe exactly as written but all I could taste was the shortening, yuck.  Made another batch using butter instead and liked it MUCH better!  Didn't care for the original shortening version at all but did like it with butter!!

Awesome. I used it to decorate a large cookie with writing.  YOu may have to play with the consistency alittle with powdered sugar so it will come out a bag and through a writing tip. EXCELLENT!

super easy and tasty! I never use shortening myself. I just do the same measurements but butter... and it's fine. I do recommend letting your butter soften by sitting out though. If in a hurry microwave on the lowest setting and check a lot so it doesn't burn or melt too much. That way it's soft and not liquid lol It DOES make a difference! :D

This was really easy to make and set up quickly. My kids loved it. I did use unsalted butter since I didn't have shortening, and it still worked well.

The BEST cookie frosting recipe I've found. Turns out well and actually tastes good too! Most sugar cookie "icings" are dreadful concoctions that taste like a confectioners' sugar nightmare (that stuff just doesn't taste good) and are too shiny or transparent. This frosting, because of the shortening, turns out softer and doesn't attack you with the flavor of powdered sugar so you can actually enjoy the taste of the cookie. And, amazingly, it still dries. It takes a little longer than more glaze-like icings - I let mine sit about 30 min., and they're ready to pack. Also, halving the recipe is a good idea if you're not making a huge batch of cookies. Have made it twice and it worked great both times!

This tasted like liquid powdered sugar, so we didn't like it.  I found it way too sweet, also. It did have a nice texture, though.

Very good sturdy icing. The only drawback is the greasiness Crisco gives it. But all in all, highly recommend this frosting.

Good recipe for Sugar Cookies.  I added a bit of real butter so it had that extra taste...but very good as it is. Dries hard and cookies turn out beautiful!  Thanks for a great recipe.

Fast, easy, and delicious.  We decided to make holiday cookies this weekend.  And we didn't have any frosting.  Found this, had the simple ingrediants, made it.  So yummy too, perfect for cutout sugar cookies.  Sets up quickly.  We made red and green.  Fun activity for the kids to do too, make sure you have lots of sprinkles!

I do love this frosting.  Easy to work with and tastes great.  I use almond extract instead of vanilla to flavor it.  Doesn't tint the frosting,tastes wonderful, and smells good.

Really good.  I subbed butter for the shortening as others did, because I didn't think it would taste good.  I started with 3 T milk so it wouldn't be too thin.  I was making red icing so I knew it would thin a lot with the food coloring.  The red was perfect, I think the the pink was a bit too thick.  It dried up nice and hard in a few hours.  Great taste.  I decorated 45 heart cookies and only used about half the icing (I didn't cover all the cookies, though - about 2/3 I just did detail icing on)  It was wet enough for sprinkles to stick very well.  Great icing!!

This is a great recipe for frosted cut out sugar cookies.  I used butter instead of shortening per another reader's advise, I think it was a great idea.  It did take a little bit more milk than the recipe states.  I added a tiny bit more vanilla too. Frosting tastes wonderful!  I made Valentines Hearts and decorated with sprinkles after frosting. YUMMO!

This was really good and easy to work with.  I used Crisco and it turned out fine.  It took a little while for the cookies to "set up" once I frosted them and once they did, they were great.  I am making more cookies this week for a party and will try the other reviewers suggestion and use butter to see what I think the difference is.  All and all, a very good recipe for frosting on cookies.  Thank you.

I dont know what I did worng but the frosting would not harden at all.  But the flavor was great.  We ended up making cookie sandwiches with this frosting in the middle.  The kids loved it.  We had leftover frosting (refrigerated it) and used it when we made cinnamon buns....it was yummy.

I made this, and it came out too tacky. So I tossed it, and omitted the shortening and it hardened quickly but not too quickly. Next time I'll try to use half the shortening, and using butter instead of shortening so I have more time to work with it on each cookie before it gets hard.

I used butter flavored shortening as it was the only kind I had on hand.  I was quite nervous due to another reviewer saying it did not turn out well, quite the contrary! I doubled the recipe, split it into two bowls, and flavored one with vanilla extract and one with almond extract.  Everyone loved it.  The perfect topper for sugar cookies- not too sweet- perfection!!

This frosting is very easy to work with and hardens relatively fast.  I had to add a little bit more powdered sugar to make it stiffer for the decorating I was doing, but it turned out great.  I will definitely continue to use this recipe for all my sugar cookies.

Used this with the Best Rolled Sugar Cookies recipe and the frosting added the perfect amount of sweetness to the cookies.  This may be TOO sweet for other cookies that are very sweet by themselves.  I only had butter flavor shortening and it turned out just fine, except it made it a bit difficult to color a yellow frosting the way I wanted :o).  Creamy and smooth and SWEET!

This frosting was great on the Easy Sugar Cookie recipe.  My little one had fun frosting the cookies!  (I used butter instead of shortening, as our family doesn't eat partially hydrogenated oil.)

Nice texture, firm and dries very quickly.  Flavor is quite sweet but does compliment some of the sugar cookie recipes for kids nicely.  Really easy to work with.

I used butter instead of shortening, and added more vanilla because the flavor of the butter was a bit strong.  It dried up very nicely!  I'll definitely be using this again!

YUM!  Turned out great!  The frosting dried very well (just enough so they could be stacked without being messed up).  Pair this with the Rolled Sugar Cookie recipe on this site.  One recipe of this is enough to frost that entire recipe.

This is wonderful for decorating! It works best with bags and tips for decorating becuase it is so thick. But it dries well and tastes great!

PERFECT FROSTING! All my other poor excuses for frosting recipes are now in the garbage - THIS one's a keeper! I only changed 2 things:  Used 1/4 C. softened butter AND 1/4 C. butter flavored Crisco shortening. This made the frosting very flavorful and handled that shortening only flavor other reviews remarked upon. Also,  I used Very Vanilla Silk Soymilk instead of plain milk - it enhanced the vanilla flavor - extra yummy! PS the best sugar cookie recipe on the site is "Grandma Minnie's Old Fashioned Sugar Cookies" by Jessica McDonald - these 2 recipes are a match made in baking heaven! My family and I thank you Kathy & Jessica!

Okay, not a big fan. Tasted like the frosting grocery stores make flowers out of on cakes. I made it a second time using butter and liked it much better. Will still continue looking for a better recipe.

A Fantastic icing recipe!  Very versatile for icing a cake and stiff enough for professional cake decorating.  I really beat it with a mixer and it was sooo light and fluffy.  A classic recipe!

It is all a matter of taste, but I thought this recipe was the perfect sugar cookie frosting. It is not too sweet and hard, but some people like it that way, if you are one of them, don't use this recipe. If you like soft frosting that isn't so sugary, use this, and you will almost certainly like it.

Very good frosting recipe.  I didn't think it was quite firm enough for stacking cookies though.  I put the cookies in individual cellophane bags tied with ribbon, and the frosting did not smudge.  The softness is good for the kids though, very tasty.  Tastier than royal icing.

WONDERFUL! WONDERFUL FROSTING!  It is the most wonderful frosting I have ever tasted, I added 1/2 tsp. of almond extract like someone had suggested and it gave it a nice flavor, but it is just as wonderful without.  I will definetly use this one over and over again!

This is the Best home made icing ever! I made the Soft Sugar cookies for Xmas with this icing. They were a big hit! Also, dont just use for Xmas cookies, you can use for any occasion...Valentines, Easter, 4th of July, Back to School, Halloween, birthdays, etc. . Just change up your cookie cuters & add the food coloring of your choice to the recipe. Enjoy!

I absolutely love this frosting, only wish it would harden a little faster.  It was a little too watery so I added about an extra cup of conf. sugar.  Other that that I loved it, the taste was great! Even added some parlour rainbow sprinkles. I don't have a sweet tooth, I have a FEW sweet TEETH.

Used butter in place of shortning. Husband LOVED it. If you wait a day or so the frosting will harden and make it possible to give a plate of frosted cookies.

The frosting tasted flat and waxy.  I added 1/4 stick of butter and 3/4 brick of softened cream cheese along with a 1/4 t. of almond extract and that saved this recipe.

This was my first attempt at making sugar cookies and frosting them, and I was very pleased with the results.  The only thing I did differently was that I used 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon of pure almond extract.  (I did this because the vanilla I have was purchased during a trip in the Caribbean and it is so strong, it tends to overpower any frostings I've tried to make.)  The almond added a very nice balance.  At first I wasn't thrilled with the frosting when I tasted it on a freshly frosted cookie,  but the next day when it had set for 24 hours and hardened, I liked the taste/texture much better.  I made this frosting for The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies by Jill Saunders.  A friend of mine tried one and said, "Sugar cookies are my absolute favorite cookies....and these are some pretty kick a** sugar cookies."  Definitely will make again someday!

I found this frosting to be incredibly greasy, the texture was very strange. I don't think the shortening worked out very well.. if I tried this recipe again, I would use butter instead.

The consistency of this frosting is great and I would recommend it for kids to decorate with. If you want to eat the frosting however, this is not the recipe to use the shortening has a tendency to coat your mouth despite being mixed well with the confectioners sugar. Don't expect mixing a ton of confectioners sugar with a small amount of other basic, flavorless ingredients to make a delicious frosting.

So far so good with this recipe. It was a bit hard to get clumps of the sugar smooth, but in the end it was fine. My vanilla made the entire thing a pale yellow though, which was convenient since I needed yellow anyway, but if you're looking for white, you'll have to use extra methods. The measurements here makes a TON. I made four dozen cookies and I only used a little over half of it. VERY sweet, but good.

I've made this several times now and it is GREAT! (I make it to put on The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies from this site - and I'm ALWAYS highly complimented on the cookies!) A little goes a long way with this frosting, so I usually halve the recipe.  Thank you for sharing it!

Didn't care for this at all...too sweet.  I prefer a slightly denser, less sweet frosting, so I will keep looking.

I used butter instead of shortening because that's what I had and it was delicious!  I don't know if I'll ever try the shortening, because I'm hooked on this recipe made with butter!

This frosting was just ok. I followed it to a tee, but it tasted too much like shortening and I had a hard time getting it to stick to the cookie. I used it to frost Michelle's Soft Sugar Cookies from this site. Maybe I would have liked it better made with butter.

This was my first time making our own frosting for "Santa's Cookies" and my special needs son helped me make the frosting. It was super easy and we had a lot of fun making it together. It was very tasty as well. Thank you Kathy for a great recipe to add to our family traditions of "Santa's Cookies"!

I am the cookie baker in my family and everyone loved it!  Followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious.  It is very sweet, but we didnt mind at all.  I used it to frost the Soft Sugar Cookies IV from this site and they worked really well together.  I will be making this again!

this frosting is good, but good in small amounts good. even though i have a major (and i do mean major) sweet tooth, this was almost too sweet for me. it was hurt your teeth sweet. my husband wouldn't even eat more than one cookie cause he said they were just too sweet. i think you could make this with less sugar and probably come out with a better result.

A great cookie frosting. I think it tastes better the next day, and it dries up very well for stacking. I've had these cookies for 5 days and they really taste better and better each day.

MmMmmm! This frosting was addicting. Goes so well w/sugar cookies. It is easy to mix w/coloring as well. It dries a bit crispy but still soft when bitten into. Perfect for cookies that go in bags or tins! They won't stick together. Make sure you let cookies set overnight.

Thanks for sharing this recipe!  Since I love the taste of butter over shortening but I since I want the bright white of the frosting I made this one change.  I used shortening but I added Butter Flavoring to it.  I buy this flavoring at Sweet Inspirations but I believe that WalMart carries it now, too. Luckily Sweet Sensations has a website since they moved their store here halfway across the state, I swear!  :-) It comes in tiny bottles; just add a bit at a time until you get the butter flavor you like.  Thanks for sharing!!!

this frosting worked well for a batch of sugar cookies i made today.  the texture and consistency are just about perfect, and they hardened quickly so i could stack and store them.  as others have said, you have to decorate with sprinkles quickly because they set so quickly they may not stick.  my only complaint is the taste - they are sooo super sugary they make your teeth ache!!  my kids gobbled them up but they're just too much for me.  thanks though!

Delicious!  I bought one of those 24 packs of pre-everythinged sugar cookies for me and my 3 year old to have for a snack tonight.  She got to put them on the pan (the only step in baking) which I looked for a recipe.  Since there were 24 little cookies, I quartered the recipe and used butter.  2TBsp of butter softened, 1 cup of powered sugar, 1/4 tsp of Vanilla and about a TBSP and a half of milk.  Mixed it in a little bowl for about a minute and just a minute or two later, we are now happily eating out late night snack.  Great easy recipe.  This is the same one my mom makes...I just needed the specifics on it.

Super sweet.  It's a good recipe when you don't have frosting on hand and you don't feel like going to the store.  I prefer store bought over this recipe for cost and taste.  I'll keep this recipe as a back up.

Didn't like this at all. We didn't defer from the recipe, and it tastes like you're eating shortening. Maybe sweetened shortening if I am being generous. Disappointed in this one, and confused at why it has so many high reviews!

I loved this frosting. It was sweet but not too sweet; I admit, I snuck more than one taste of it while frosting my cookies.  :) I only had a dozen cookies, so I scaled down the recipe to 12 servings and still had some left over.  The only problem I had was creaming the sugar and shortening.  It was dry and just not blending, so I added an extra tablespoon of shortening and that did the trick.  I used the frosting to add some flavor to a batch of gingerbread cookies that turned out a bit mild and dry for my taste.  I don't know if this icing and gingerbread sounds like a strange combination, but it was good to me! Thanks for the recipe! I'll keep it on hand for cookie decorating in the future.

I made this recipe along with the best rolled out sugar cookie recipe on this site for a family party, and everyone loved them! the cookies tasted delicious and they looked great! i just put some frosting in a sandwhich bag, cut a hole in the corner, and started piping! i couldn't of asked for a better recipe, and will always come to this one for cupcake or cookie frosting!  Note: I added an extra tablespoon of milk for better consistency. Make sure to use vegetable flavored shortening, and not butter flavored!

The taste was ok but it was very very very runny... I even added more sugar to try and compensate! :(

Made exactly how recipe stated,everybody has different taste and this just didn't quit have the best taste.  It tasted too much like shortening for me.  I think next time I'll use half butter.  Great texture though, that is a 5!

this frosting was great all around. i used it for piping my cookies as well as filling in between the piping. it dried nicely so that the cookies were stackable. i can't imagine a more perfect frosting.

Recipe was "okay" but not what I was looking for.  Wanted more of a glaze.   Too rich for my taste and you can't stack the cookies on top of each other.

Great icing, stays soft, but still stackable. I used butter-flavored Crisco (which is now trans-fat free) and I thought the flavor was just as good as a buttercream recipe. Thanks!

This is basically a cake frosting in my opinion.  For cookies, I prefer something that hardens so I can layer them in tins. It's good frosting but not for cookie decorating.

I will always use this recipe from now on.  Thick, amazing icing.  Allow time to dry.  Added in the confectioners sugar slowly.  Also added a little extra milk so it was creamy.  Great recipe if you need to separate the icing for different colors.

The flavor of this frosting was good, but it came out thicker than I had anticipated. I just added a little extra milk to thin it out a bit so I could spread it on the cookies easier. Otherwise I definitely liked this recipe.

This recipe did not work for me. The frosting turned out so thick that it did not even stick to the cookie. I ended up throwing out two batches and going with a frosting that would stick better. I would not recomend this at all.

This is fine frosting but it was definitely missing something: BUTTER flavor!  I had doubled the recipe with just shortening but decided to do the recipe over substituting butter for shortening and then mixing all three batches together.  It worked well and tasted much better.  By the way, 5T of milk seemed to make the frosting a bit on the thin side.

Excellent frosting recipe!  I used butter instead of shortening, but otherwise followed this as written and it was fantastic.  Like another reviewer said, it's a thick "frosting," and not an "icing."  It was exactly what I was looking for, set up well enough on the cookies so that I could stack them, and tasted great.  I'll be using this one over and over again.

Make sure to not use  ton of this on your cookies - very tasty, but very sugary. Other than that, this was an awesome recipe and perfect for decorating, or just spreading over the top.

This recipe works great but I also have a tip... When mixing your ingredients, always mix the wet ingredients together first... then add your dry. That way you avoid the lumps that others have mentioned. If you just mix the sugar with the shortening and add the liquids later you're going to get lumps! Also, always sift your powdered sugar to get the lumps out of it before you even start. If you have a Kitchenaid mixer (like I do) you probably can eliminate the sifting step since the mixer is a miracle worker and never gives me lumps.

Not too runny, not too thick. Although, I found it does not dry well, if you are wanting to stack them. Very tasty and perfect for spreading.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was easy and tasty! The consistency was nice and thick and it dried pretty fast. I was a little freaked out about using shortening but if I try not to think about it it's a delicious frosting. I'm curious how it would taste with butter instead.

This tasted awesome.  I reduced the recipe, I think by half, and it turned out great.  I do think I left it in the blender a little too long because it had a lot of air in it when I went to spread it on my cookies, and that made it difficult to spread nicely.  Luckily, it was just 3 year olds decorating gingerbread men.  It worked perfectly, and wasn't as running as icing.  I would DEFINITELY use this recipe again.

I'm a big sweet tooth so I figured I'd try this recipe out since it got a lot of good reviews. However the frosting wasn't like I expected. It kind of tasted like sugar cubes if you could turn it into frosting, which isn't really my kind of flavor.

I changed it just a little.  I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening.  I also used 4 T orange juice and 1 T milk.  It turned out fabulous with the gingerbread men recipe - the one that calls for orange zest.

This is a simple recipe that is a huge step up from the plain powdered sugar + milk that I was using before. I just dumped everything in the bowl and beat on high- no problems with clumping. Put in a small ziploc freezer bag, cut off a tiny bit of the bottom corner, great for piping! My Christmas sugar cookies and gingerbread cookies look and taste great! Thank you for such a simple, yummy recipe!

I combined some of the suggestions others have made.  I used half shortening and half butter, rather than just one or the other.  I also followed the suggestion of mixing the shortening/butter by hand at first, adding the powdered sugar a half a cup at a time.  I also added a wee bit of salt.  The frosting turned out the perfect texture and tasted great.   This will be the only cookie frosting recipe I ever need.

The recipe is awesome! I've a frosting for cookies thats not to sweet like the typical powdered sugar and corn syrup, but something that wasn't as think and heavy as buttercream icing. This is it! Tastes fantastic, but not to sweet and not to heavy. I added a little corn syrup to it though which helps it crust over for easier stacking.

This frosting was GREAT!  I did listen to some other reviews and thought of a way to add more flavor so I added 1/2 tsp. almond extract, used butter in place of shortening and it was wonderful!  If that ingredient was in the original recipe this would have received 5 stars from me.  Thanks, this is a keeper!

Yummy frosting! Worked great for icing and decorating sugar cookies. Love how it stiffens up without getting hard. Made it twice - once following recipe exactly and once using 1/2 shortening and 1/2 butter instead of all shortening. It tasted better the second way, I think.

This is a good and easy recipe, especially if you don't want to bother with softening butter.  I added a 1/2 tsp. of almond extract and it was perfect!

I used this to frost the cream cheese sugar cookies from this site.  I added 3 more tablespoons of milk to make it easier to frost.  This was delicious.  I have had difficulty in the past with various frostings.  This was perfect and I will definately be using it again.

This icing wasn't brillant. I followed the recipe exactly and I didn't seem to get the results I was hoping for. 

The main problem I had was it was just took plain. I would recommend either using an additional flavoring or like other reviewers suggested, replacing the shortening with butter.

I love this frosting! I made just a few adjustments. I cut the recipe in half and that was more than enought to decorate 3 dz. average size Christmas cookies, including a base color and piping.

This is perfect and so good. The only chnage I made was I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening for the shortening. I also started to add the milk and vanilla (I had mixed these two earlier to save a step) after the sugar and butter/shortening started to resemble crumbles (just a few minutes if that). Very easy and great

Kathy, thanks so much for submitting this recipe- it was just what I needed to frost my rich cakelike Chocolate Jumbos (a Schoharie County, NY favorite). I wanted to imitate the storebought consistency with a stark-white frosting that was sturdy enough for stacking big cookies but not TOO stiff and brittle, and not too sweet either. This was creamy and easy to spread but hardened just enough on the outside to resist smooshing. One thing: I started out following the directions for -gradually- mixing sugar and shortening, but I was barely half-way through when the stuff was too dense for my Kitchenaid to cream properly! I used some of the milk early and it turned out fine, but I don't know how one could do it otherwise... Overall a good recipe, just in time for my Thanksgiving dessert!

This was pretty good.  I also halved the recipe. When I tasted it I didn't like the taste of the shortening, so I added 1-2 tablespoons of room temperature unsalted butter.  That helped.  I also used heavy cream instead of milk.  This made it more creamy.  Finally, I added a touch more vanilla and few tablespoons more pwdr sugar to compensate for the added butter.

This was a great recipe! I used it to frost "My Favorite Sugar Cookies". I divided it into 3 bowls and colored each differently. Some of it I put into plastic baggies with the tips cut off, and decorated the frosted cookies with that. It worked really really well. Our foreign exchange student and I had such a fun time frosting these! I got a lot of compliments on my cookies from when I brought them to a church dinner. :)

This was a great frosting recipe.  It smoothed on the cookies wonderfully!  It also worked great to pipe embellishments onto the cookies.  I blended the shortning and milk then added the p-sugar 1 cup at a time.  Smooth and creamy!  They were great on sugar cookies found on this site.

I loved this frosting.  The ratios were spot on.  Dries very quickly for a buttercream type frosting with very good flavor.  Used butter crisco.  This volume frosted 2 batches of sugar cookies.  Divided up into several dishes and tinted accordingly.  You can play around with the extracts.  I added some vanilla, rum, and hazelnut.  Thanks for this great recipe that made frosting 2 batches of cookies quite easy.

I have tried TONS of frostings for cookies. My hunt is over. This frosting is excellent! Not too sweet & not too hard. It dries JUST hard enough to stack. I do prefer almond extract over vanilla in cookie frostings so I did substitute the vanilla for almond. I also added 1 tsp of light corn syrup. Perfect. I am so addicted to this frosting that I have made cookies 2 x's a week for a few weeks now!!! Thank you for such a great recipe.

I've tried over 50 recipes for sugar cookie frosting for my 19 year-old son who claims to be an expert in this area.  This recipe (according to my son, also) is, by far, the best we've ever had!  You won't be disappointed!  We'll definitely make it several times each year.

This frosting is AMAZING!!!!! I've tried more than my share of frostings and such and they were always so dense and sickly sweet. This one, however, is neither of those. It's light and fluffy and everything that a good frosting should be. I followed the recipe exactly, and used the whisk attachment on my mixer like one review said to do. This frosting is soooo much better than anything out of a can. I definately recommend it!!

This looked great and piped easily. I used half butter and half butter flavored shortening. They only problem I had was we piped on top of a powdered sugar, milk glaze that was spread on the cookies first. Some of the decoration broke off when stacked, but maybe it was still too soft when packaged. I will use this recipe again.

A nice icing for cookies. Made quite a bit too. My sugar and crisco never got to a smooth texture, all I was getting was a big white cloud in the air, LOL, so I just added the vanilla and milk and this turned out very nice and fluffy. Thick and easy to spread, nice texture, tasty too! Dries nicely for stacking cookies for transport..

Cheryl, I just wanted to tell you that when you use a paste or gel, you will get a much stronger result.  They also deepen in color quite abit while they are drying, and you do not have to use as much as you do when you use a liquid coloring. Hope that helps you for next time.

The is a good recipe for a nice white frosting that sets up well. The recipe called for shortening so I used regular white crisco (not margarine) and I also used colorless vanilla exgtract, this produced a very nice white frosting. I agree with some of the reviewers in the fact that it lacked flavor. I added about 2 tbls butter and some almond extract which seemed to help add some flavor with out affecting the consistancy or the white color. I would probably use this recipe again.

I used this recipe to frost some gingerbread cookies and it was terrific! I would definately suggest halfing the recipe.  The frosting tasted great, firmed up well for my cut out cookies and was easy to decorate with.  I will use this recipe again!

very good frosting, a little thick but very tasty. i added almond extract instead of the vanilla for a different smell and taste.

this will be the frosting i use for my sugar cookies from now on!

This is a very good frosting for sugar cookies! Very easy to work with! I added some raspberry liqueur to part of the batch & that was YUMMY!

Easy to make, but tasted too much like confectioner's sugar. I would suggest using Almond extract, or similar to improve flavor.

Perfect recipe!  Exactly what I wanted in a sugar cookie frosting.  Went great with the Easy Sugar Cookie recipe from this site.  I will be using this for years to come.  Thank you!

I have used this recipe every time I have made "The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies" from this site, and they are a perfect match! I also like it made with butter better though. I have made both ways and have never had any complaints. Thanks Kathy!

A wonderful frosting!  This worked great on my sugar cookies.  I did add 1/4 teaspoon of salt, and subsituted a 1/4 cup of butter for the same amount of shortening to give it a better flavor.  But this is a great basic recipe.  I will definitely make it again!

This is a great frosting for sugar cookies.  It is not too sweet like some of the others I have tried.  I did use butter instead of shortening..(I like the taste better). I have even used this on frozen store bought sugar cookies to give it a "homemade taste".  It is always a hit!!

So easy and turned out great -- I halved the recipe and used butter (I don't use shortening when I bake), and the frosting was gorgeous.  My frosting also hardened a bit, just enough to be glossy, and also made the cookies easier to store :)

This frosting is absolutely perfect!  I used it for Christmas cookies this year and it turned out beautifully!  I only made one batch, but I made three colors/flavors by separting it into different bowls.  I made chocolate by adding cocoa powder (for baking) and red, green, blue and yellow food coloring (you have to be careful to use a bit more red than green or it will look like poo, as I discovered). I made butterscotch by adding butterscotch extract/flavoring and colored it a baby yellow (this was my favorite). And plain vanilla, as called for.  The texture and spreadability are just right and wonderful for sugar cookies.  This is definitely going in my "To Keep" file!

Perfect!

I used this on top of "Delilah's Frosted Cut-Out Sugar Cookies" from this site, and they were a HUGE hit -- everyone thought I bought them. Made them for Halloween, and now my relatives and co-workers are begging me to make them for Christmas.

NOT what I was looking for!  I liked the consistancy of the frosting, but, it had no flavor.  Just tasted like powdered sugar and Crisco.  I did like how it set up.  I was able to stack the cookies and the frosting didn't stick.  I will keep searching for a similar frosting with better flavor.

Fabulous, fabulous, fabulous! I made giant sugar cookies for my son's grade school classmates for Halloween and I used this icing on top. They came out beautifully.

When the recipe tells you to cream the shortening and sugar together, it doesn't come together as you would expect it to. I was afraid that the icing wasn't going to come out, but as soon as you add the milk and vanilla it smooths out beautifully. Before the wet ingredients it basically looks like powdered sugar with a few lumps of coated shortening. Don't worry. Everything will work out fine.

Thanks for the recipe Kathy! It's a keeper!!

This is a great recipe for sugar cookie frosting! It tastes like the frosting that is on the Lofthouse sugar cookies in the store. It's very soft and creamy. It is ONLY good for cookies.  Do not use it for anything else!  I used it on cake and then realized it was not right at all for any other application besides cookies.

I have tried many frosting recipes and this one is THE BEST. It is not runny at all and very easy to make. It is soo delicious. My husband ate the whole bowl, so I had to make more. It dries very well.. I will use this everytime I need a frosting recipe!

I have made lots of frostings for cookies and this is by far the easiest and best tasting.  We let them air dry on a plate and then were able to stack them in an airtight container with a layer of waxed paper between the layers without messing the decorations up too badly.  My husband and daughters thought this frosting was better than the grocery stores and most bakery's.

Terrific frosting!  Made to recipe, except using butter flavor shortening.  Turned out perfectly!  It set up wonderfully (not hard, not squishy but just right)& tasted just like at the bakery.  This does make a very large batch though - I generously frosted 4 dz cookies & still had 1/2 a batch left.

This frosting turned out very smooth. I used butter-flavored Crisco and could just eat the frosting alone (but I won't, at least not that much of it). I'm using it to frost Dora's Christmas Cookies.

Yummy!  This is really great frosting for sugar cookies...it's not too sweet and dries hard enough to stack.  I put them in piping bags and decorated my cookies...they looked great!  I used the sugar cookie glaze as a base coat.

I have no idea how this recipe has almost 5 stars.  It is the most disgusting thing I've ever tasted in my life.  Sat down with my kids made sugar cookies made the frosting then they tasted the frosting and they made a face and said, "do you like it?". It is so gross anybody that gave this 5-star should be taken off of Allrecipes permanently and never allowed to rate anything ever again!

I love this recipe! It is best to let the cookies sit out overnight so the frosting has a chance to set.  It is still soft but they are easily stacked between parchment paper without ruining them. I am not a fan of royal icing and this is a great alternative. You can't get as intricate as with icing, but you can still get your point across. I like to put it on there a little thick with sprinkles on top.

This was ok. The frosting tasted a little greasier than we like. However, It was easy to dye, spread, and store.

This is a good go-to recipe. It tastes good and is a workable, nice-looking frosting. Not sure if it's because it's cold here today or not, but we noticed very small molecules in our frosting (probably the shortening). This made the frosting look a little sparkly when mixed with rich, bold colors (I used Wilton's cake frosting gels that I purchased at a craft store.) I like that this doesn't have almond extract.

DEFINITELY use butter rather than shortening.  Tried it both ways and my family and I prefer the taste of the butter - shortening tasted too "commercial" and not home-made.

If you add 1/2 cup of softened butter you'll get the old Wilton Buttercream Icing that is great for decorating. It won't be as "white as this but the flavor will be a bit better and it'll knock down the sweetness just a tad.

I made this frosting to go with the Easy Sugar Cookies, also from this site. Wowsers, they are a great pair. The recipe made plenty, I have quite a bit leftover. That's okay, my no-sugar-diet cheat day is tomorrow. I will eat all of the frostings.

Shortening in frosting… skip the Crisco and go for the butter.  The difference is palatability.  Butter just tastes better; does anyone put Crisco on their toast?  The second most important ingredient is the vanilla.  Frosting is basically vanilla butter.  This frosting also dries well, but not immediately, leaving time to add on the yummy Halloween decorations.  Time for frosted fingers!

I loved the recipe. I have never made sugar cookies due to the mess. I found an excellent (easy, no mess) cookie recipe and used this frosting. I did use half shortening and 1/2 real salted butter with food coloring. I was able to stack the cookies and freeze them to keep them fresh. I cannot wait to make another batch this weekend!

When I'm not making fancy royal icing decorated cookies...this is my go too! It's SO good when you just want a quick icing to go with some quick sugar cookies. Dries well enough to be stacked but is not hard to bite into. Perfect texture! I have done some variations in the past too. Instead of vanilla, I have used other flavor extracts. Sometimes this colors the icing but I don't mind. My favorite variation is strawberry extract. On Valentine's Day I make heart cookies with this icing using Strawberry extract. Gives the icing a lovely pink tint and it tastes SO good. I also usually use butter flavored shortening. I have used butter when out of shortening and it does give it a more rich flavor, but the icing never dries enough to stack. I have also used half shortening and half coconut oil....turned out delicious! I recommend this simple and classic icing to all my friends. And people always want the recipe! Good for any occasion or holiday! Always a hit with The Best Rolled Sugar Cookie which can be found on this site too. Happy baking!

Worked out fine and the taste is what you would expect from the ingredients used.  Dries quickly, so keep it covered if you are taking your time to frost with different colors.  I found it to be a very stiff frosting, but that is what I wanted.

I don't know if it was my shortening of what, but it never combined with the sugar correctly.  It just ground into a sandy, nasty mixture.  When I added milk I had to add 3 times the reccommended amount to even get a workable frosting.  The vanilla didn't cover the vegetable oil flavor that made me want to gag  :-/  I must have done something wrong.

This turned out to be absolutely delicious frosting, but I did have to add a pinch of salt to balance the sweetness. The frosting stays soft, for the most part, so you either need to cover with sprinkles or wrap them carefully when storing.

I used hardly any on one cookie to test it and the next morning it was mushy and dried almost clear. I followed it exactly, no question. I decided to start over because it was the right consistency before all that milk. And this time I only added 1/2 tsp of vanilla and 1.5 tablespoons of milk so it would be thicker and THEN it was perfect. Good frosting, thanks!

I used half butter and half shortening and it was still 'wet' enough after 30 minutes to add sprinkles. Add the milk/vanilla liquid slowly because you may not need it all, depending on how spreadable you want the frosting.

I didn't like it because using shortening leaves a greasy and thick taste. I didn't use all the confectioners sugar it asked for either rather I tasted it as I went because I don't like overly sweet frosting. I needed a quick white frosting and chose this because of the high ratings. I will not use this recipe again and I will avoid using recipes calling for shortening in future.

I have made this recipe twice. The first time I didn't correctly incorporate everything in the best order for the best consistency. Watch the video! It helps! Alternating sugar and milk helps and makes it turn out perfectly. First time I made it I would give it 3.5 stars and this most recent time I give it 5! :) Very simple and great!

I used butter in place of shortening and subbed 1/2 t almond extract and 1/2 t vanilla. I let the frosted cookies sit on counter overnight to set frosting before putting them away.  Delicious flavor.  This recipe is a keeper if you like lots of frosting instead of a light powdered sugar icing.  A big winner with my family!

This is the BEST icing i've ever made. I made this exactly as the directions call for. It is very sweet, but paired with a bland sugar cookie it's just perfect. It's even better the next day when it has "set up". Will be keeping this one

Good consistency if your looking for a soft frosting but all i can taste is the shortening in this recipe (i used crisco) I will def. be using recipes with butter from now on.

This frosting grew on me after I made it. When I first whipped it together, I wasn't sure I liked the shortening. But, when I added it to cut-out sugar cookies and sprinkled some mini chocolate chips on the top, it was a huge hit. This may have been partly b/c the cookies themselves were not so sweet, so they were a nice compliment to this mega sugary fluffy frosting.

Honestly, This is the most amazing sugar cookie frosting recipe that i have ever tried. I need a last minute easter snack save since the last cake i made ended up having nuts in them (which my mother-in-law is apparently allergic to) and i will say, this was quite a save. I am so happy with it.
 i will agree with Chloe and say that I also alternated milk and icing sugar.
This was amazing!

Yum!  This frosting was exactly what I was hoping for.  The flavor is perfect, and so is the consistency.  The frosting didn't harden completely, just enough to help it hold it's shape, which is great because I like my sugar cookie frosting to be soft when I bite into it.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Perfect frosting for cookie decorating parties - the frosting sets well so you can even stack the cookies. Used butter instead of shortening for better flavor.

This was not a hit with our family.  The shortening not only adds a yuck flavor, but a greasy after taste.  We used these on Santas cookies and nobody wanted to eat them.....including Santa :(  Next time I'll stick to using my recipe with real butter.

WOW!! I just got done making this and it is the BEST frosting I've made!! I used butter instead of the shortening and used the tips that others suggested about craming the butter first then slowly adding the sugar and it turned out perfect! Not sure how someone can mess this one up. So tasty!!

Excellent cookie frosting!  I used 1/4 cup of shortening and 1/4 cup butter.  Perfect consistency for decorating cookies.  This (along with the Best Rolled Sugar Cookie recipe) will be our new Christmas tradition recipe.

easy to make and frost! Hardens nicely and takes food coloring well! It's easy to make it taste too much like powdered sugar, so make sure you put enough milk and vanilla in (I had to add an extra tablespoon or so of milk)

Holy frijoles this was sweet!  I took a nip before I put it on the cookie and ran to the fridge for a glass of milk.  I added 3 oz of cream cheese to the frosting to tame it a bit, and once paired with the cookie it was better.  I think that I will add more cream cheese next time or keep looking for a frosting recipe.

Good, sewer. Used butter kids love it. Not white the vanilla turned it a little. I love cream cheese frosting and I was not sure I was going to like this but it's great for the Halloween cookies we are making. Thanks

The icing had way to much vanilla flavor. I think a buttercream icing would have better flavor for a sugar cookie.

I used this frosting on Sugar Cookies IV from this site and changed the fat to 1/4 c unsalted butter and 1/4c shortening.  Tinted the frosting and this recipe frosted 24 large cutouts.  Really good!

Very sweet, but delicious frosting! I used margarine instead of shortening and I also only added 3 tbls of milk as I wanted a thicker consistency to the frosting. I am usually not a "frosting" person, but I LOVED this and found myself licking the beaters after mixing.

So easy to make and frosts cookies nicely...good consistency.  make sure to layer your cookies with paarchment paper in between cookies if storing in layers or the icing will stick to other cookies.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Following the directions exactly resulted in a frosting that tasted mostly like wet confect. sugar.  I had to add cream cheese to this to make it taste better and spread smoothly.

I really enjoyed this frosting.  It spreads easily & the consistency is great.  However, I do think 4 cups of confectioners' sugar is too much for this recipe.  I would recommend cutting it down to about 2 or 3 cups.  Or simply start at 2 cups & add more as you go along while tasting it.

I wasn't impressed at all with this recipe and could really taste the shortening.  Was a little better after the cookies sat a few days, but who wants to let sugar cookies sit?  They're too tempting.  Needless to say I'm still looking for a good sugar cookie frosting recipe.

This frosting was perfect. The flavor was delicious and it was easy to make. I used butter instead of shortening and the frosting still hardened just fine after you allowed it to set up. I was able to stack and pack the cookies to take to Christmas parties. It was also easy to pipe on details with the frosting and it colored very nicely. I will be using the recipe again.

I made this recipe 2x in the last 2months.  I like it because it is easy to work (I added just a little water in a small bowl to make a icing wash) with and it hardens up nice but not soo hard its like eating glass like royale icing. The only thing i don't like about it is the shortening. I haven't tried using just butter yet. While making; there are little clumps. To get them out I had to mix very fast with a rubber spatula for a good 10mins. My arms hurt. The clean up was a little difficult cause of the shortening, very oily.

This is the perfect sugar cookie frosting. The creamy goodness of buttercream, but it sets well enough that you can stack cookies on top of each other. Beats the pants off royal icing in the taste department.

The consistency was perfect! I don't even really generally like frosting but this was tasty. My only issue would be that one batch makes enough to frost about 8 dozen cookies rather than 4. I made one batch and colored the whole thing green thinking it would only do half of my cutouts and I'd make another batch and color that one red. So basically I ended up with all green cookies which wasn't really a problem I just would have like to have known. Other than that awesome!

This is SOOOO good!!  We didn't have shortening, so we substituted unsalted butter, which was perfect.  It takes longer for them to set up in order to stack when using butter (so I hear), but after a couple of hours they did set up well and stacked with no problems of smudging on each other.  I also used almond extract instead of vanilla, because it's my favorite...divine!!!  This recipe + Best Rolled Sugar Cookies = Sugar cookie perfection!

This was easy and tasty! My 2 year old loved decorating and eating the frosting!  It takes to colors really well.  I did use extra shortening and accidentally used a TBS instead of a TSP of vanilla, but it still came out great!

Pretty good frosting. Sweet, but not to sweet. Dries fairly quickly so cookies can be stacked, but doesn't get hard. My only issue was with the taste, it seemed a bit off. Maybe next time I'll try substituting half of the shortening for butter. Made half of the frosting chocolate by adding in some cocoa powder and it tasted great.

Just what I was looking for! Perfect for the sugar cookies I made. Did halve the recipe, though. Thanks!

doing my test run of cookies for x-mas before mailing them out. Made Mary's sugar cookies but never turned out like b4, dough turned out too sticky for my cutters so just rolled cookies for the family, but wanted to try different frosting. So far this is good, worried about have a shortening taste, but never happened, added some orange extract and tasted good. Love the consistency for frosting, better than sugar cookie icing(whenever i do this one its runny but does harden nice and bright) This kids tried some before totaly hardening and love em. Just seems to take awhile to harden, but wait and see. A beautiful bright white for my snowmen. Will use this year. Do need to add more shortening to blend.

This was easy to mix up and work with.  I also added a teaspoon of almond extract because I like the flavor.  Would use again on cut out cookies.

This frosting was great for frosting cookies made from the sugar cookie recipe on a box of Jiffy baking mix. It stays creamy, yet slightly firm on the surface. I replaced a quarter of the crisco with butter to give it a hint of butter flavor.

this is the best simply icing recipe I have found. it stays maleable long enough to use throughout the day -- I put it in ziploc baggies with the corner cut off and used it all day in a variety of colors. yummm!!! would be tasty with almond extract too...

I have used this recipe many times, and it turns out great every single time.  This time I used it to top the rainbow clown cake cupcakes for my son's birthday.  It piped on very easily and made enough to frost all of the cupackes.

i only give it 3 stars because of my own lack of cooking experience. the flavor was perfect but my frosting came out too soft/runny. i used butter instead of shortening. maybe i softened the butter too much over over mixed it. i really want to make it work because it tastes great on a sugar cookie!

This was an easy, tasty recipe. You can't taste the shortning at all. It was a good consistency for piping onto cookies with an icing bag. The only substitution I made was using rice milk in place of the regular milk because of a dairy allergy and you really couldn't tell the difference. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was good tasting, but it hardened so quickly that I couldn't get sprinkles to adhere.  I would prefer it to be a little creamier.

Two words: USE BUTTER. Shortening makes this greasy and slimy, but real butter is fantastic. This also is a good basic buttercream to use on cake or cupcakes, not just cookies.

Perhaps I needed to add more milk because though the frosting was good, it was a little on the dry said. Followed the directions to the letter but our dry Utah weather probably didn't help. Will try it with butter and a little more milk next time.

Ooooooh... boy, is this stuff da bomb!  I followed the recipe exactly except used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup shortening.. so glad I did!  I didn't think this was too sweet, but I spread the frosting rather thinly.. but it developed a lovely crust and a creamy center.. tickled the taste buds!  I used it with Best Rolled Sugar Cookies recipe on this site.. the combination was stellar!  Thanks for sharing.

This frosting is great paired with the "Soft Christmas Cookie" recipe!  Tastes delicious!  If you are from FL, pairing these two recipes will get you the taste of the Publix sugar cookies!!!  They are great!

really thick, but i thinned it out with more milk.  I also cut the recipe in half and still had entire bowl after icing 3 dozen large cookies.  Looked and tasted great.

The flavor was great! I beat the frosting with an electric mixer and the texture still seemed a bit grainy. It did not adhere to the cookies very well either.

This frosting was really easy to make and tasted delicious. The only problem I had was that the powdered sugar started to show through when I added darker food coloring. Not sure why, but it didn't look appealing. The light colors worked out perfectly.

This worked pretty good. I  used this to outline cookies for a baby shower.  I was hoping it would harden more based on reviews but it worked out.

Absolutely perfect!! I hate the greasy aftertaste from shortening but in this recipe you couldn't even tell. I colored some black, orange and purple for my halloween sugar cookies and they came out beautifully. It only took about 30mins for the frosting to set to that the cookies could be stacked. This will be my go-to recipe for cookie frosting!!

Great recipe!  I loved how it dried hard enough to stack the cookies, but still soft enough inside to be creamy.  Very sweet, but I made it with a pretty un-sweet cookie, so it balanced out well.  I did find that 5 tbsps of milk wasn't enough, so I basically just pour little bits of milk from the carton as I went along.  I stopped when I had the consistency I wanted so I don't know exactly how much it took.  I also liked the way it coloured with my colouring gels.  It held a really nice vibrant colour.

This frosting came out perfect. I followed some others' tips and halved the recipe; I still had more than enough!Wonderful texture, pipes and spreads very nicely. I will definitely be using this recipe again for all my holiday cookies.

I used this frosting with the 'Soft Sugar Cookies IV' from this site. The icing was perfect, not too sweet as to overpower the cookie, and not so bland that you didn't notice it had a flavor of it's own. The woman I made the cookies for absolutely loved this. This icing is it!

This is a great frosting to work with for sugar cookies!  I typically use Sugar Cookie Icing from the site but needed something sturdier to do monogram cookies for a christening.  This was perfect and very easy to use.  I will use this again and again!

This is a great recipe.  I "tweeked" it a bit by using 1/4 cup shortening and 1/4 cup butter.  I also add about 1/2 teaspoon of butter flavoring.

Very good tasting frosting, nice and creamy and my friends all loved the cookies (used the Soft Chrismas Cookies recipe from this site - wonderful cookie!)  I just wasn't too happy with the way the frosting looked on the cookies, not real smooth like I like for sugar cookies, had to add some colored sugar sprinkles on top.  I'm still looking for the perfect frosting...

Very simple recipe to make.  I don't always add the shortening and it works out fine.  I find I need more milk than the recipe calls for.  I just keep adding it (very slowly) while mixing until it reaches the right consistency.

Excellent, excellent.  I stole someone's idea and used butter instead of the shortening.  I also took someone else's advice and cut the recipe in half, as well as added the sugar to the butter in 1/2 cup increments.  I only made 30 sugar cookies, and I still had a good 1/2 cup of frosting left over.  YUM!  It does dry fairly quickly, so if you are putting on sprinkles, etc. it's great to have a kid around who is willing to sprinkle right after you frost.  Thanks!

I've always had a hard time finding sugar cookie frosting recipes until I found this one. I absolutely love it as does my family! It's not too sweet and sits well on the cookies so that you can stack them in a container and not worry about them getting all messed up. I definitely plan to use this for all my holiday sugar cookies!  Nicki

Very tasty.  My only issue is, after it sits for a few days on cookies (even in sealed container), it gets very hard.  Weird to have a soft cookie with that hard icing.

This is a fantastic recipe. I have already used it several times on my sugar cookies. It makes for a thicker frosting(this is NOT an 'icing')that is perfect for using on a more cake like sugar cookie.

This is very yummy frosting. I used this with 'The best rolled sugar cookies' and it turned out awesome. I used lemon extract to add some zing. It dried in about 20 minutes, so I could place the cookies in storage containers.

This is the perfect frosting!  My husband doesn't usually like frosting because it is too sugary and sweet and even he likes this recipe.  Thanks Kathy!

I used this recipe to frost the thick cut-out xmas cookies and it was fantastic.Best cookie and frosting ever. I did tweak it just a bit. I had French Vanilla creamer (the liquid)to substitute for milk. I bet the Hazlenut and some of the other flavors would be great also, just as a change.

Simple and delicious.  I added almond extract because I love the flavour in a good icing recipe.  Easy to make with the directions as is, and it will turn out perfect.

I am rating this 3 stars because I really didnt like the way the shortening tasted with this.  I switched to butter on the second batch and it was much tastier. I frosted the cookies when they were still warm so it melted the frosting a little and left a shiny smooth surface.  I will proably try the royal glaze next time.

I've been looking for a sugar cookie frosting for a long time now...well, the search is over...this is the one!!!  I used this on the The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies recipe that I also got here at allrecipes.  They turned out great!!!  And, if you are looking for an icing that dries nicely, this is it.  I even shipped some of these to my nephews.  They did great via USPS from Texas to PA...nothing broken and icing still intact.  Definitely will be using this recipe again.

I used this frosting on 1/2 of my Halloween cookies (Sugar Cookie Icing on the other half).  This is easy to make and decorate with, I piped an outline on the cookies and then microwaved frosting so it was easy to spoon onto the cookies.  I used butter instead of shortening.  Although this frosting doesn't look quite as polished and shiny as the Icing, the taste and consistency were better and they still look great!  I will be using this recipe from now on for my sugar cookies.

This was my first attempt at making frosting and it was so easy and good.  I was a little scared from the look of the sugar and shortening but once I put in the milk and vanilla it was right on.  I divided the frosting up into three bowls and added food coloring.  This was enough for all the cookies that I made, perfect amount.  I used this on the best rolled sugar cookie recipe from this site and they were a hit.  Thanks!

This is the BEST frosting recipe I have ever tried.  The only substitution is that I used butter instead of shortening.  It was very firm, dried quickly, and tasted fantastic!  Thanks for putting this one on the site!  It has become my new favorite butter cream frosting!

Wonderful recipe! I made one little alteration. I used 4 Tablespoons of milk and 1 Tablespoon of lemon juice. It gave the frosting a slight lemon finish. It was a hit at my Mason Lodge!

This worked out great for what I needed.

I changed out the shortening for butter,
to make it a little richer. I halved it,
which wasn't difficult at all. I needed just about two and a half tablespoons of milk to get it to the consistancy I needed.

Not to sweet and easy to spread.

Great frosting recipe! The only change I made was to use butter-flavored shortening instead of regular. 

I split the frosting into two and colored one red (which took a whole tub of gel!!) and one blue, for our family's July 4th celebration. The recipe made more than enough to decorate a strawberry sheet cake with about 25 blue stars and about 13 stripes (not exact, I know! ;), as well as about 50 Mama's Sugar Cookies! Plus, we had some left over.  

I'll definitely be using this one again. :)

This icing was so easy to work with, and like other reviewers stated, it dries pretty quick and packs well once on the cookies.  I did change the shortening to unsalted butter though, because of personal preference.  Yummy !

I halved the recipe, which made enough to generously frost 2 dozen cookies with some leftover.  It didn't harden completely, but that may be because I put too much on.

Wow, this recipe is great! I've tried quite a few cookie frosting recipes and this one is by far the best.  I split the recipe in 1/4 since the original recipe makes quite a bit of frosting.  Before I mixed the shortening and sugar with an electric mixer, I blended it together with a rubber spatula against the side of the bowl.  This greatly cut down on the amount of powdered sugar flying out of the bowl when I used the mixer.

I doubled the vanilla and also added one teaspoon of coconut extract. It was absolutely delicious. It becomes a little harder to stack the cookies if the layer of frosting is very thick - so the thinner the frosting layer, the easier it is to stack. 5 stars

This was very good frosting.  It had the right consistency and dried nicely so I could stack my cookies on top of each other with no problem.  It is pretty sweet (of course, it is frosting!) so I only halved the recipe for my set of about 32 cookies.  It was just enough.  Thanks for the recipe!

Makes a very glossy, pretty icing.  Pipes well.  I'm not a huge fan of the taste, though.  If you're going for pretty, you'll be happy with this icing.

These were really great but I like my frosting MUCH more thick than what recipe calls for.  I will tweek it next time.  Use this frosting with the Best Sugar Cookies Recipe (they truly are the BEST)  that I have rated.  You won't regret it!

I don't know if it was me, but I had to add more milk to the frosting, b/c it was not "spreadable enough."  Either way it tasted good, and made the cookies very yummy!

This was so easy to make and tastes sooo good!  It tastes very similar to those sugar cookies you can buy at the Walmart bakery with the thick creamy frosting and sprinkles on top.  This worked very well for frosting with a spatula and for piping through a bag.

Great recipe! I'd add the sugar slowly because otherwise it can be very hard to mix and it can get very clumpy, then you gotta spread it out with an spatula... takes forever!

I used this frosting with the "Best rolled sugar cookie" recipe from this site...it was excellent!  I did add a little more milk.  Used green & red food coloring and we used basting brushes to "paint" the cookies.  I highly recommend this one!  Thanks so much for sharing!

I used this to ice sugar cookies and gingerbread cookies.  I added a little more milk to make it thin enough to pipe with a decorating bag and tip.  It spread really nicely, too.  I will use this recipe over again many times.

This is pretty good.  It's exactly what I was looking for.  I halved the recipe and it made plenty for 3 doz. sugar cookies and had enough left over for about a 1/2 doz. more.

I substituted orange extract for vanilla and lemon juice for milk & the frosting is fantastic!  Otherwise I followed the recipe and just added lemon juice until I got the right consistency.  The cookies I made are not so great but the frosting can hide anything.

I thought the taste of this was really nice.  Not too sweet.  But when I added food coloring to it for some reason it didn't mix in well.  It was new food coloring too.  
 Even though my husband said that is was just an ok recipe, I would probably make again.

this recipe went really well with the Best Rolled Sugar Cookies recipe.  It was a lot easier to get all of the clumps of powdered sugar out when I used a hand mixer.

This is delicious just as it is.  I did use the scant cup of Crisco otherwise exactly as written and it was wonderful!  No need to use butter at all, this is the way frosting was meant to be.  It got rave reviews at my house on our Halloween cookies - we used Soft Sugar Cookies IV - just great!

Wow - I agree with many others here - really great recipe! Followed directions exactly and the frosting came out perfect. I used this recipe for Halloween to make ghost and pumpkin cookies and they were a hit because I added the almond extract.  Makes me want to start my own cookie business :o)
Thank you so much!

I made this w/the Best Rolled Sugar Cookies as well.  I also substituted butter for shortening b/c I didn't have any.  I had trouble getting it to harden.  Not sure what happened. I thought it was the butter, but after reading other reviewers maybe it wasn't.  The frosting tasted great, and even decorated ok.  The cookies couldn't be stacked, but were better the next day.  I took them to a play group and everyone liked them. I am going to try again.

This icing was GREAT! Although, I would just dump everything in the mix master bowl and mix it up. I found it kind of stiff in a way and added about 3 tbsp. more milk to make it more creamy, but, it wasn't runny at all. It makes alot of icing but I think it's fine, you can use it for cupcakes too! I made it with The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies, as another review said, and it was DELICIOUS! Hope I was helpful!

Very good with the recipe for Best Rolled Sugar Cookies from this site.  I used Crisco shortening which made the frosting pure white and didn't tint it.  Instead I iced each cookie and then sprinkled with colorful sugars!  Beautiful and tasty results - everyone raved!  Yum!

This year I had my neices, nephews and sisters out for a cookie baking party.  We had a blast.  This is the recipe I used.  We used the frosting for sugar and gingerbread cookies.  I plan to use this recipe next year.  Thanks.

This is a great frosting.  I did have a little trouble getting it to stick to the cookies.  But overall it had a great flavor and went well with The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies from this site.  Thanks Kathy!

I was just making heart-shaped cookies for Valentine's day and was in a hurry and wasn't sure what I did with my frosting recipe so I quick went on line and got this one and tried it.  It really wasn't very good.  Next time, I'll look harder for my own.

Delicious---was looking for frosting for my husband's grandmother's sugar cookies and this was perfect!  Not too overly sweet, perfect consistency.  I used butter because I like it better and paste food coloring as others had suggested.  Made little footballs and helmets for superbowl party---Yummy!

I used this recipe with The best rolled sugar cookie from this site. This frosting was nice because once it dried, you could stack the cookies, and they would'nt stick together. Will use this again, thanx!

A great frosting for cookies! I used butter instead of shortening, and followed the rest of the recipe. It turned out great and was perfect for the sugar cookies we made,(Soft Sugar Cookies IV, also on Allrecipes).

This was way too sweet for my taste.  I ate one sugar cookie frosted with this and after a couple bites my stomach had that icky feeling from too much sweetness.  I will say the consistency is good. It spreads very easy and makes for a pretty decorated cookie.

I quartered this recipe because I didn't have nery many cookies to frost. When I first tasted it I thought it tasted way too much like shortening, so I added some more powdered sugar, vanilla, and milk. It ended up tasting pretty nice, but it's not the best cookie frosting recipe I've ever made or tasted. I did like how it dried hard and glossy, though.

This is a reat home made frosting recipe, especially if you want to decorate and use pastry bag and tips.  I often have bought store bought cream cheese frosting, I think I can skip doing that now and use this.

This is pretty good stuff.  I added a few drops of lemon juice to cut down on the sweetness and it was just right.  The consistency is perfect for kids to work with.  We put this on cream cheese sugar cookies and gingerbread men.  Yummy!

This recipe is just right, its not too hard or soft. I added some lemon extract to it for decoration and got many compliments on how it gave the cookie that extra 'someting'. One of the best frostings i have ever used by far.

This frosting is the perfect thickness. I did find it too sweet so I added more shortening to taste and a tad of milk to bring it back to the original thickness. I love almond extract in my frosting, so I added that to taste as well. I will deffinately use this again!

I used this recipe to decorate a chocolate chip "vegan" cookie cake for my son. This icing turned out delicious and very easy to work with when I piped in the details I wanted on the cookie. The only change I made was to add soy milk instead of regular milk, and the end result was as good as the orginial.

I found this recipe to frost a lot more cookies than it said it would.  It tasted great and had a great consistancy!

Hands down the best sugar cookie frosting ever. I use it with the same cookie recipe someone else mentioned (grandma minnie's) and they are the first gone every time. When I added them to my catering menu, I started making them by the droves because they go just that quickly. This one will stay in my recipe box for a long long time. *****!

Amazing. Simply amazing. This stuff is great. It hardens to keep it's shape and is great for my elaborate decorative cookies and cakes. I also replace the vanilla with a little maple sometimes... awesome!

This was the best frosting I have ever had!!! I used butter instead of shortning. I made so much of this recipe for my daughters playgroup, and all the moms had fun licking the frosting off their kids fingers! Delish!

Used this frosting on some soft sugar cookies and the combo of the two was delicious. I tinted the frosting pink, and I used butter instead of shortening. Why anyone would want to use shortening is beyond me!!

Yummy Yummy!  This is a great frosting that hardens just enough but still soft.  I added an extra 1/2 cup of confectioner's sugar to take away that shortening taste.  It was perfect.  I was able to frost about 80 2" heart cookies with the recipe.

This recipie is great although I found I needed to play around with the amount of sugar and vanilla to get the taste right. Tastes too much like shortning if you don't put more sugar in it. Overall it's a great starter recipe. I will be using this for my main frosting recipie. Thanks!

With all of the great reviews I was surprised to be so disappointed.  The consistency was good but I did not care for the flavor.  Someone else mentioned that it just tasted like Crisco and powdered sugar and I agree.  I will not use this recipe again.

I only had 2 cups confec sugar, so did a half recipe and was still able to cover 72 cookies with quite a bit to spare!  I also added some lemon juice instead of vanilla (I always add lemon to my sugar cookies instead of vanilla) and it tastes great.  Thanks for the great recipe Kathy!

This frosting was ok.  I liked the consistency, it spread well on cookies and looked great but it lacked in taste. It tasted like hard powdered sugar and distracted from the taste of the actual cookie rather than compliment it.  Needs more vanilla or maybe almond or butter flavor.

This frosting was ok. Sorry, but I wasn't blown away by it. I wound up adding a lot of extra milk (probably twice as much) and added extra vanilla because otherwise it had very little flavor. The consistency still didn't seem right, so I wound up adding about 3-4 tbpns of corn syrup. It's not hardening quite the way I expected, but it is a quick and easy recipe to whip up when you're in a jam, or feeding kids who like anything sugary anyway.

Tastes wonderful, however, I needed to add a bit of milk to make them easier to spread.  Quick, easy, and tasty!!

Very good.  Try using almond extract in place of vanilla for a nice change.

I used this recipe as a glaze for scones - I added a bit more milk - worked out wonderfully. put the icing in a baggie, snipped off the end and drizzled it over them! I made 2 different scone recipes and the icing went from counter to fridge twice without a problem!

This is an excellent cookie frosting recipe. The ease of preparation, taste and consistancy are remarkable. For a different taste, I add a teaspoon of almond extract. This is the only cookie frosting recipe in my recipe box!!!!!!

I’ve been using this basic decorator’s frosting for forty years. I use almond extract instead of vanilla. I think it gives it a more festive flavor, as I usually make frosted sugar cookies at Christmas.

My favorite sugar cookie frosting recipe! I use butter instead of shortening and it's much creamier. I also add in 1/2-1 tsp of almond extract for an extra yummy flavor. This beats store-bought frosting every time!

I don’t have much to compare it to. I will say it was easy to make and spread on the cookies I made. One batch I made the recipe as is and my second batch I split the extract measurement between vanilla and almond. Both batches were delicious. I used the frosting on a sugar cookie recipe I found on all recipes, for the best rolled sugar cookies. One batch of the frosting was plenty for that recipe. The recipe is worth a try.

I made this frosting last night and my daughter did not like it, I thought it was ok. Then I read some of the reviews and used butter instead of shortening and WOW what a difference! The taste is better and the consistency is better. So I recommend using butter instead of shortening. My daughter loves the recipe with butter.

For me, this was a perfect replica of the "white frosting from a can" that we frosted cutout cookies with when I was a kid.  Made it for my Christmas cookies this year and it spread well, hardened beautifully, and tasted like childhood memories.  Thank you.

I did as a few view reviews mentioned and used butter instead of shortening. I made less cookies than the icing is for, but that's ok cause I accidentally dropped my mixing bowl and lost about a cup of icing ?? my kids and husband are enjoying the cookies with the icing while i clean up the mess. They seem to enjoy it so I'm a give it a A+ since they're picky about their sweets

Good frosting.  I read the reviews and thought I would be fine using the butter flavored Crisco that I already had on hand.  Made a half batch and my family did not like it for cookies.  It was a good "buttercream" frosting but very much disliked on a sugar cookie.  Also, keep in mind that if you use butter or butter flavored Crisco, the end product will be yellowish, not white.  Went to the store and bought plain Crisco with better results.  Yes it was very sweet. The Crisco was nice and white but the vanilla changed the color slightly so be prepared.  I had some people tell me the frosting tasted like shortening but it was overall well liked, especially once it was on the cookies and covered in sprinkles.  I liked the texture.  It was very soft, wet, and velvety and the sprinkles stuck nicely, but it eventually "dried" as much as a fluffy frosting is going to.  It will not get hard like royal icing.  It will smush if you push it hard enough, but it will get dry to the touch and not come off on your hands unless you push and scoop.  You will eventually be able to stack these, but the stacking will smush your sprinkles into the frosting.  I think I will try a few more, but this is a good frosting and very easy to make.

It tasted good, I did add a touch of meringue powder to help harden, not sure if it effected it much. I also doubled the vanilla.  My experience, it was easy, it hardened, (not to hard), it was easy to spread and put in frosting bags, my one complaint was it may have been too moist for sugar cookies, they need to be crisp and extra moisture is not good for them, next time I will cut back on the milk to compensate for the extra vanilla.   I am not giving up on this frosting as it is very close to perfection.

This is a fluffy frosting that is a joy to work with. It spreads nicely and holds decorative sprinkles well. We weren’t able to get all our cookies frosted on the same day so I covered the bowls with foil to wait for the next weekend. I took the foil off and the frosting remained fluffy for the whole time. Great taste too.

This frosting is just the right amount of sweet. You can be very generous in frosting with this recipe too.  The outside kind of hardens up a bit after some time, but it will still be soft when you bite into it.  I added additional milk because I wanted to work with something more pliable.  Overall this is a fantastic recipe.

Used butter instead of shortening and added a little extra powdered sugar, a dash of lemon juice and a dash of salt.

I use this recipe every year for our Christmas cookies.  It tastes delicious and dries beautifully.  I find I usually need to add about 1/2 cup more powdered sugar to get the consistency right.

Great taste! Sweet but not overly. I didn't alter the recipe at all. We used this frosting on "The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies" recipe found here and it was a great combination. I did double the recipe to have enough for white, green and red frosting but we had a lot leftover. Next time I won't double.

I didn't have shortening, so I used margarine instead and the frosting still turned out great! I'm definitely planning on making it again.
I divided my batch in half and added a few drop of mint extract to it as well, and it added a nice flavor to the cookies + frosting!

Y'all. This frosting is where it's at. I tasted it after just having made it and honestly wasn't a fan--it left a lot to be desired. I still used it to decorate my cookies anyway because I was in a rush haha. Anyway, about a half hour later I check on my cookies and the frosting had hardened up beautifully and tasted INCREDIBLE. It tastes boring on its own, but complements sugar cookies (or pumpkin cookies, in my case!) incredibly well.

I have been using this recipe for many years and it has never failed me. I make sugar cookies with the kids, but I'm not really a fan of them. However, this frosting is really tasty without being overly sweet, so I end up dipping my finger in for a sample. Very easy recipe and compliments the sugar cookies.

This is very similar to the frosting we used for sugar cookies when I was a child, except that it uses shortening instead of butter.  As other reviewers have noted, this is makes a good frosting. Mine didn't harden but they tasted good.  I may die of a sugar coma.

I left out the vanilla extract because I don't care for the taste, and used butter as my shortening as I do for most baking. The icing came out a beautiful white cream colour. I used the rest of the recipe as written to pipe borders around my sugar cookies, then added a little more milk to fill in the designs. The leftover icing went to frost cupcakes, which came out on the sweet side but was still delicious! This will be my go to recipe for cookie decorating next time!

Made mine with butter ornate of shortening. Had no problem with it drying and being able to be stacked and bagged. Great recipe for when you want to create frosting with textures (I made mine with fur for Halloween monsters cookies). If you want the flat shiny coating, you need to use a royal icing recipe.

I've should've trusted my gut.  A glop of crisco + a ton of powdered sugar = Yuck.  Unless you love the taste of vegetable shortening, look somewhere else.

Used on the soft sugar cookies. Sweet frosting, the kids love it. Very easy to make, does get pretty solid. After decorating, I left the cookies on a baking sheet in a cool oven overnight to for, the frosting.  If you like working with pastry bags, this frosting is excellent and does hold the shaped it's piped in.

I halved this and followed the directions. Soooo sweet. Too sweet even. The sprinkles stuck well. I used Betty crocker sugar cookie mix and used very little of this on top and it was okay, prefer without the icng.

Used this recipe with the "The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies" recipe.  Easy, easy, easy.  Turned out great.  Didn't change a thing.  I went as light as I could on the cookie in that we added sprinkles too.  I had to tap my finger on the sprinkles so they wouldn't roll off.  They looked great and it was a fun project to do with my young grandsons.  Thank you!

Perfect, just as it is. If it seems too thick, add a tiny bit more milk. Too thin, increase the powdered sugar.

Can be piped easily with a pastry bag (or ziploc bag with the corner snipped out) or spread with an offset spatula. Doesn't completely harden to a crunch, it stays smooth and creamy, but you can still layer the cookies after it dries -- just use parchment paper between the layers.

I followed this recipe as it said. The frosting came out exactly as expected. It was pretty flavorful. The cookie I made for it wasn't tasteful, but this frosting gave it flavor. The frosting does harden a bit when it's sitting there, so if you are doing sprinkles or whatever on it, make sure you place the sprinkles as soon as you put the frosting on. Other than that, enjoy!!

I love this frosting!!  I follow the recipe to the exact.  It tastes great and sets up nice.  I have tried using butter (which tastes great but doesn't set up as nice), half shortening and half butter, and just like the recipe says.  All turn out great but depends on personal taste.

This is the basic recipe I have used for 40 years in cake decorating .  I used 1 cup Crisco (do not substitute), 2/3 cup milk, dash salt, 1/2 tsp. butter flavoring and 1 tsp. clear imitation vanilla which you can get at a hobby shop or online.  The colorless vanilla allows you to get a true white frosting.  Mix as directed above.  This is a lot of frosting so you can cut recipe in half, however, any leftover frosting can be put in Tupperware or a Lock & Lock and refrigerated for several weeks

This was a very sweet frosting. It wasn't as stiff as I was expecting, which made it  difficult for my kids to decorate with. I used butter instead of shortening because it's what I had on hand, perhaps that's why it wasn't the right consistency. I'll be giving this recipe another shot in the future!

I use salted butter and omit the extra salt called for. I use this recipe when I want to frost sugar cookies for my personal consumption (as it is tasty, stays soft and fluffy when dry, but cannot be stacked/easily transported). If you're looking for an icing recipe that will dry hard and allow you to stack the cookies for easy transport, use "Sugar Cookie Icing".

Just awesome frosting period. We only had half the shortening so we added butter to fill it up and the frosting turned out superb. Not too runny or too sweet.

I substituted butter in for the shortening and the sugar did not ever incorporate into the mix and it was very liquidy.

YUM! I usually don't care for icing on my cookies, but I needed something to finish my tooth shaped sugar cookies for my Dental Assisting class that I was making and this worked beautifully! I didn't have any complications with mixing it at all and in order to get it more smooth spread, I just microwaved each iced cookie for about 5 seconds and it evened out all imperfections! Even after microwaving, the icing set so well and fast! Stacking wasn't at all an issue. Will be making this my go-to icing for cookies from now on!

It's a good solid recipe, but sweeter than other recipes, like those soft cookies sold in grocery store bakeries, so not everyone will be a fan.

This is a great frosting for sugar cookies, it tastes great and sets up nicely. It's not super hard but I was able to stack a few cookies on top of each other at room temp (70 deg) and they didn't stick together. It takes a while to set which is great for adding decorations - I used this to decorate cookies with my niece.

This frosting is amazing!  Everyone who try my cookies absolutely loves them.  I did make 1 little change I added 5 tbsp of light kayo syrup.  I think it makes the color brighter and it gives it kind of a Shiney glazed look finish.  :-)

This frosting held up quite nicely although it did make some of the cookies stick to one another a little bit when stacking them in a Tupperware.  A few cookies ended up sticking completely together to make sandwich cookies.  This recipe was a little too sweet for me but was a big hit with my family and friends.  I  followed another tip here where I added a little of the confectioner sugar along with 1 TBSP of the milk repeating the process until all of the ingredients were added.  I think this helped avoid the white mushroom cloud you get when you add too much confectioner sugar at one time.

I would definitely make this again!

I tried this recipe and was pleasantly surprised. It spread perfectly and was not overly sweet. I thinned it a bit for writing and for small decorations. This recipe is a keeper! Adding colors was no problem. My grand girls and I had a ball decorating our cookies!!!

The only thing I did different was I halved the recipe.  Didn't need that much frosting.  It is not too sweet.  It is just right.  The consistency is perfect for icing sugar cookies.  Will save this one for future use.

I made this with The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies. I halfed the reciepe to see how much it made. Half made enough for atleast 20 cookies, seperated into 5 different colors. I used 2 cups confections sugar, 1/4 cup shortneing, 3 tablespoons of milk and a whole teaspoon of vanilla. It does take a while for the icing to set hard, we made ours the night before an event. My daughter had the best time "painting" with this icing.

Followed to the T. They were so dry & utterly lacked flavor. Except for the taste of flour. Icing definitely is messy (doesn't "set" properly) taste like sugar dumped in shortening.

If you like super sweet frosting like I do, this is the recipe for you!  It makes a lot, so I'll probably half the recipe next time. The changes I made were adding an extra Tablespoon of milk to get more of a glaze consistency, and I used butter in place of the margerine. I put the frosted cookies in shallow baking dishes covered in foil over night and by morning the frosting was firm enough to stack in a tin. I will make this recipe again!

I've been making sugar cookies w/frosting for Christmas for almost 30 years & have found that the shortening just does NOT taste nearly as good as real butter does!!!  Everyone loves my soft sugar cookies & my crunchy ones too (different strokes for different folks, ya know?). Just be sure to keep them in separate tins or they'll BOTH end up soft! 

 I also sometimes roll each cookie Into a ball & then just flatten  w/fork tines in a criss cross pattern & then  sprinkle w/red & green (or whatever color  u desire), before baking them!  Same delicious flavor ...just a lil bit less sweet!!!

This is the perfect frosting for squeezing from a pastry bag (AKA ziplock bag). I have a 5 year old and a 3 year old and this was the right consistency to easily decorate their cookies for Santa. 
I used shortening as the recipe suggested but prefer the taste of butter in my frosting. I was afraid using butter would affect their ability to decorate though. This version tastes fine. If you're purely after taste, butter MAY BE the better option. I can't wait to review this and the perfectly rolled cookie dough on my blog! (my name .net if you're interested.)

I really liked this icing. I did use real butter, though. I think butter is always the way to go. It has better flavor. I will use again!

This is great frosting recipe.  I accidentally measured a tablespoon instead of a teaspoon on vanilla extract, and I also added some butter extract.  I used butter flavored shortening.  It dries enough to lightly stack the cookies, but the frosting is still a little soft. My kids were able to easily decorate their cookies and approve of the taste.

This is a great frosting for sugar cookies. It was easy to mix together and set well. I used butter instead of shortening and melted it a bit to make it easier to mix. I frosted about 36 cookies and had plenty left over, so I think the recipe would be just right for about 48 cookies.

This was a super easy and tasty frosting! To give it a better flavor I used 1/4 cup of butter and a 1/4 of shortening (I actually used lard). It spreads easy and makes for a simple, old-fashioned tasting cookie!

The only thing I did differently is add 1-2 tsp corn syrup and 1/2 tsp almond extract.  The corn syrup makes the frosting shine.  This is a keeper.

This recipe was easy, tasty, and just the right consistency for spreading on sugar cookies.  It also set nicely with a hard crust.  I was able to transport two dozen cookies by just throwing them into a Tupperware container.  I didn't have issues with the frosting getting squashed during transport.  It also took to food coloring well (I used gel, not liquid).  Half of this recipe frosted two dozen cookies (about two inches each) with a little bit left to spare.

This frosting is delicious, it dries hard in no time. Only substitutions I made was add half butter, half shortening and added almond extract instead and added a bit more. The frosting is a bit thick and won't produce the prettiest frosting for cookies, but add sprinkles on top and it is delicious.

Liked the recipe but a little to sweet for my taste so I halved the sugar to about 1/2 a cup and butter to only a tablespoon didn't have any milk on hand so i  mixed about 1 tablespoons of sour cream and 1/4 of a cup of water together and  also added 2oz of room temperature cream cheese mixed all ingredients very well taste fantasticsl

Oh my gosh, this recipe is PERFECT! It's got a nice consistency, especially when made in a mixer, and it doesn't have that overwhelming powdered sugar taste that I've found in way too many other recipes. I used it for cookies, and then I used it for cupcakes, and I also may or may not have sat on the couch eating it at midnight.... =D Also, if you add cocoa powder a little at a time, it can make a nice chocolate flavor.

I made this to ice some sugar cookies for a fall social last week, and it was great. It was quick and easy to make, colored well and tasted fantastic. The only complaint is that mine turned out a little dry, so I added a little extra milk and extra vanilla (I like a strong vanilla taste) and it turned out fine. I made this early in the morning and left the frosted cookies in the cookie container on the counter for about 8 hours before serving and it had hardened a little on the top but was still awesome. I am not a big fan of frostings that contain shortening, but this one was tasty. :) I had a some left over and plan on making more cookies this weekend. Here is a link to the cookie recipe.   http://makebakecelebrate.com/lets-talk-about-rolled-sugar-cookies/

For me it was perfect!!  I wanted something simple that my 4 year old granddaughter could share with me and this did it.  We mixed it together, she frosted most of the cookies with a small amount of taste testing and hubby loved what she did.  A win win for sure that I have already saved the recipe for for next time and many to come. :-)

While this icing is delicious and easy to make, I was expecting, based on the reviews, for it to dry hard - mine did not.  I will still use this icing for small batches that don't need to be stored long-term, but the fact that it prevents me from being able to stack my cookies is definitely a negative feature for me.  I will try this recipe one more time with less sugar to see if that gives me the desired texture - otherwise, I will keep looking.

Great recipe. A little thick to spread depending on how much food coloring you put in.if you don't add food coloring I would add about 1-2 tsp of milk. I also added 1 generous tsp of butter flavoring which made it taste like butter cream but not too strong or yellow. The half batch that I used nearly a whole bottle of food coloring had the best consistency. It also hardens nicely for stacking but not too hard. It is now my go to recipe for cookie frosting.

This frosting compares to the frosting on those  Grandma's Pink Cookies people love, but even better because you know what's in it...

If you love frosting, this is the recipe for you.  It is quick and easy to make and delicious!  This recipe made a lot of frosting, which is good because I wanted to eat the frosting by itself.  It will be my go-to frosting for sugar cookies.

This is the best frosting recipe I have tried yet. I used butter instead on shorting and it was great. It is very sweet so I added a little more butter and it was perfect. Definitely try it. You and your family will love it.

Had amazing flavor! Only issue I had was when I added the food coloring, it gave the frosting a grainy look but I do not know what I did wrong! Still was amazing with my sugar cookies though!

I'm on a low carb diet so cut the batch size in half. However I still wanted to curb my sweet tooth cravings so i added chocolate chips and skor chips on top. Delicious! Also try substituting the shortening for butter.

So good!! Mine didn't quite come out stiff though but it still worked. I used with butter however because the first time i used the shortening it tasted really strong and then realized it was best by 2008 :\ eww. any who, butter turned out just great. you'll have to mix in the milk first before it will be come creamy though or else it probably will just stay powdery.

I don't like sugar cookies, and I always find the icings too watery and sweet.  But this icing is wonderful... I have to say, I dropped the sugar to 3 cups, and I used Crisco butter sticks instead of plain shortening (and I'd agree with the user who said to cream the shortening first, then slowly add the sugar).  But the result is wonderful - sort of like cake icing, and not as sickly sweet as I'm accustomed to!  Thank you!

I attempted this recipe while we were snowed in and found out I didn't have shortening. I used coconut oil instead, and while the end result was thinner and had a faint coconut taste to it, it was a huge hit.  I have since stocked up on shortening and will continue to make this recipe....the proper way.  Very tasty!

This was perfect. My grand daughter decorated the cookies and loved doing it. I had a friend said to try butter instead of shorting. Maybe I will try it next time.

Made this to put on top of refrigerated sugar cookie dough pucks. Halved the recipie, then divided into small bowls to add food coloring. Wasn't sure if the food coloring would dilute, so put in enough powdered sugar to "look right". This recipie is great, husband and kids all loved it!!

I'm rating this as five stars simply because it delivered what it promised: a great sugar cookie frosting that's soft when it spreads and hardens nicely. The only thing that I wasn't that excited about was that it didn't have that delicious buttery taste that I've come to associate with sugar cookie frosting. But, if you're cool with that, there is not reason why this frosting isn't perfect in every way.

Mine dried just fine, A little too dry really.  Becomes flakey and looses it's appeal quite quickly, but if serving within a couple of hours you should be happy with this recipe.

I tried this recipe for the first time yesterday, following the ingredients exactly.  The frosting turned out great, and I didn't have any trouble with it not drying.  We put our goody plates together probably 2-1/2 hours after frosting the cookies, and the frosting and decorations stayed intact.  Thank you for sharing a terrific recipe!

It did the job I guess, but I won't be using this recipe again.  The consistency is not at all what I was expecting.  It's VERY sweet and it was hard to get it to stick the cookies...and hard to get the sprinkles to stick the frosting!

It was okay...not sure if I would make it again.  Texture was a little off.  Didn't spread very easily and had a harder time getting sprinkles to stick to it, had to dip cookies in sprinkles instead.

Way too sweet and too thin to spread onto cookies. 
I subbed butter for the shortening and all you can taste is way too sweet butter.

It was pretty good not a fluffy as I expected but pretty good I halfed the recipe and made it 24 servings instead of 48 , And since I didn't have shortening I used butter maybe that was why it wasn't as fluffy Also a little too sweet but i liked it because i made pretty plain cookies , Yum:D BTW 4 1/2 stars :D

This is a great icing!
Extremely easy to make and mixes very well...I used 1/2 tsp vanilla extra instead of 1/4..and I wouldn't suggest doing that again. lol
Makes it a tad too sweet for my taste but if your receiving party has a big sweet tooth I would def suggest it!

I was looking for a stiffer frosting, and this did the trick. It is not the smoothest looking frosting, but it is tasty. I substituted cinnamon oil in place of the vanilla.

Delicious! Stacks up well! After adding food coloring it did look grainy, does anyone know why or how to fix?

This is the perfect frosting for sugar cookies!  I doubled to frost 7 dozen 2" round sugar cookies for our Easter children's lesson at church and there is a lot left-over.  The frosting took several hours to set up for me to be able to stack them, but it was a little humid where I live.  
The complaint that this recipe is 'too sweet' is a silly complaint since it is FROSTING with 4 cups of powdered sugar.  The ingredients tell you up front that it will be sweet!
I loved it though, definitely a keeper for my house.

Wow, this recipe is so simple yet so delicious! I actually used this on brownie cupcakes- yummy! I would really suggest using it. Although it's not as fluffy as regular cupcake frosting, it's flavor is just as strong if not stronger. I would recommend this to all who like sugar!

Great recipe.  I added another tsp of vanilla for my taste. Also, I didn't want the trans fat from the shortening so I substituted a stick of unsalted butter. Wonderful!!!

My go-to icing recipe for sugar cookies. It's easy to decorate with, sets up stiff enough to stack and actually tastes pretty good, too. I like using this a lot more than royal icing. I will never use royal icing again. This is so much better!

Warning:  you definately need to use an electric mixer to make this recipe!  The recipe does tell you but I tried with just a spatula and now it is a paste...not frosting.  Still tastey.

This icing is so sweet! I'm not sure how to describe how intense the sweetness is, but I'd say on the level of Cadbury Eggs with cotton candy mixed in. I guess I prefer a milder, more buttermilk type frosting, but I was afraid that wouldn't set. This recipe did set, but it was for naught because we couldn't eat any of it. Too bad, it was easy to make and looked pretty. It's a very thick and fluffy frosting. I did cut out some milk. I used maybe 1 tbl and added it slowly while mixing on high. Anymore than that and I noticed it started to get runny and fall apart. Use your own judgement; you'll know when it's ready.

The recipe, as is, is a bit too stiff for spreading and needed to be thinned just a bit more with milk to stay put on the cookie. It had a slightly off flavor, but otherwise quick, easy and something I will definitely use again. Paired excellently with "The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies" here on the site.

I had tried another recipe for sugar cookie frosting prior to this one, and it came out much too sweet. This one was perfect! Easy to make (I halved the recipe because I had a small batch of cookies left), soft enough to spread easily, and stiffened up without getting hard. I will DEFINITELY be using this one again.

I gave this frosting a try because my usual butter frosting makes cookies stick together.  I made 6 dozen a few days ago and the cookies still look nice and no sticking.  Thank you.

Simple enough. I feared that the icing would not set after reading a few of the reviews but it did, took a little longer than other recipes in the past BUT I was making over 54 cookies for an exchange and it gave me time to decorate.

Tasted like shortening.  Even after adding more sugar and vanilla.  In the end it wasn't too bad.  Tasted ok on cookies but not so much on its own (just to taste)

This is an ASTOUNDING icing for rolled sugar cookies!!! I always fiddle with recipes however, and I ended up making this once and adding almond extract on top of the vanilla. Magnificent!!!

Very good frosting! I use butter instead though because I don't like using shortening, and it turns out really good:)

BEST. 
I've been baking for a while now but I could never find a recipe that worked well for me. They either had an awful taste or some other flaw, but not this one. 
It's extremely easy to make and bomb to eat. (dad says it's too sweet) I love this, not only will I bookmark this recipe but I'll actually take the time to write it down. After so many failed attempts at frosting I tasted it with caution, I licked the spoon clean :D 
You MUST try this. 
Note: although I'm usually quite meticulous when it comes to measuring, I was with this and it turned out lovely.

I love this frosting; thanks so much for sharing it.  I used butter b/c I like the flavor better but otherwise used it as is with "The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies" from this site.  They were a wonderful match.  It has just the right amount of sweetness.

I made the frosting and of course had to sample some while frosting the cookie, and I was thinking there wasn't too much taste and couldn't understand the hype about the recipe.  Well let me tell you, I had a cookie after the frosting had time to set up and WOW, what a difference in flavor.  The longer they set up the better tasting!!  Great frosting and it's made it to my kitchen recipe box!!  Definatley recommend for those sugar cookies!!

Perfect. You can eyeball the sugar and shortening. I halfed the recipe but put in  a bit more than 1/4 cup shortening then I just added powdered sugar. Also put in teaspoon vanilla and I always use cream instead of milk. Either way turned out soooo good.

This is the texture and taste I was looking for!  I scaled it down to 12 and had to add another 1/4 tsp of milk, making it 1 tbsp and 1 tsp.  When I made it, I mixed 1/4 c. powdered sugar and the shortening together then added another 1/4 c. p. sugar and 1/2 tbsp of milk, mixing well after each addition.

Made this for valentine's cookies and it tasted a little too sweet to me, but my boyfriend liked it. I would add less sugar. Also, the first step where you have to cream the sugar and the shortening did not work at all. It wouldn't get creamy until I added the milk and I added more than what the recipe called for.

Made this last night.  Used butter instead of shortening but I think I will use shortening next time.  Super simple recipe that tastes great.  My husband and daughter love it!  We decorated sugar cookies for Valentine's Day.  This will be my go to cookie frosting.

Absolutely fantastic!  I ran low on confectioners' sugar and had to split the recipe in half. however I accidentially still put 5 Tbs of milk-it was amazing! I don't think i'll ever buy vanilla frosting at the supermarket ever again.  This recipe makes a fair amount of frosting..almost too much!

This frosting is great! I followed the recipe exactly. I was confused a bit at first when it said to cream the shortening and sugar together. My mixture stayed powdery instead of creaming together. But once I added the other ingredients, it turned out great. For those of you who say it's grainy, I'm wondering if you are using confectioners' suger, and NOT granulated sugar.

I used butter since I didn't have shortening, and half & half since I only had skim.  It still turned out great, and was white enough even with those substitutions to color nicely.  Will definitely make again.

This is an awesome frosting. Everyone loves it! I found that cutting down the sugar by 1 cup made the frosting much smoother. If not, you can feel the sugar granules.

I used the Cream Cheese Sugar Cookies off this site and topped them with this icing. I was about 1/2 cup short of confectioner's sugar but that didn't seem to matter too much. When I was mixing it, I was worried I wasn't going to have enough icing because I had 6 dozen cookies to ice. However, I had way more than enough!   This is definitely a "frosting" like on a cake, but all I did was fill 4 individual bowls with the frosting and add food colouring depending on the colour I needed.

LOVE this frosting!  I have been searching for something close to what my "Cake Lady" always frosted cakes with when I was growing up.  I made this recipe as is a few times, but felt that it had a funny aftertaste.  When I make it now, I substitute the vanilla for more milk.  Whatever is required for shortening (depending on how many servings I'm making) I halve it and do 1/2 shortening and 1/2 butter.

Darn good frosting!  I made 1/2 the recipe and easily frosted 30 drop sugar cookies.   This frosting has a rich buttery flavor and spreads so much smoother than canned.   Thank you Kathy for sharing.

Good recipe! The frosting was very easy to work with and it wasn't too sweet. It even hardened a bit, but still stayed soft. The only thing I did differently was use butter.

I stumbled upon this recipe hoping it was "the one". I was disappointed. This icing has good texture but wasn't sweet enough for me. It just wasn't what I was looking for. I will have to continue my search...

The best icing ever!!!  I really like how it allows you some time to work with it before it hardens.  I used butter instead of shortening, and it still turned out great.  Perfect for sugar cookies.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used this frosting on the chewy sugar cookie recipe. Very good! I think this could be a versatile frosting - perhaps on cakes? I definitely see myself frosting and filling chocolate cup cakes with this frosting in the future!

This frosting tastes great, but it didn't dry as hard as I was hoping. If I were to stack my cookies, some of the designs would be smashed.

Wonderful.  Used both vanilla and almond flavoring to intensify the almond flavor of my sugar cookies.  Left them out overnight to dry and harden before bagging and ribboning them for sister's baby shower.

Frosting is easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out a little thick so I added more milk to thin it out. Consistency is still a bit on the thick side. Dries very nicely, however.

A nice frosting for sugar cookies. My old recipe was a bit too soupy and I was looking for a recipe that was thicker. This was perfect. It also dried nicely for stacking.

The taste was good but I wouldnt say it was awesome. For decorating cookies this frosting worked really well.  Just be prepared to wait for it to dry. It took about 2 hrs to be dry enough (still not fully dry) to place into ziplocs.  I will use this recipe again.

This icing tasted great but it didn't harden the way I had hoped - I ended up having to transport the cookies on a baking sheet rather than stacked in a container. I made it a little thinner so it would spread more easily and not be so thick on the cookies.

I have made this twice.  The first time I beat it with an electric mixer as stated, but the frosting was quite fluffy, not exactly what I wanted for cookies.  The second time I just mixed it with a spoon.  It tastes good and hardens just right, but it is hard to spread and pipe smoothly.  For more professional looking cookies I'd try something else, but this is a good recipe if you don't want one with egg whites or corn syrup.

I used this with the Best Rolled Sugar Cookies from this site and will using this combo every holiday for my sugar cookies. This is just like the frosting that my mom used to make- doen't get hard, firm on the outside so you can put them on top of each other and kinda creamy on the inside. Just make sure to decorate them right away or the candies won't stick. I love this recipe!!

The frosting tasted great!  I used butter and it didn't cream very well.  It made the frosting lumpy.  Next time I think I'll use the shortening.

Yummy icing. Subbed butter for shortening. Cookies were stackable after allowing ample drying time. Used star tip to decorate cookies w/ this frosting.

I used this recipe to decorate gingerbread cookies and it turned out well although I modified it for a few reasons: I didn't have access to a hand mixer and I didn't want to have excess frosting.  I whisked together 1 cup powdered sugar with about 1/3 tsp of vanilla extract and about 1 tbs of milk. It's a great consistency that won't stick to other cookies once it's set but the weight might flatten your design so keep that in mind.  Great basic recipe! I would recommend using this icing with the Butterscotch Gingerbread Cookie recipe by Nestle Toll House - it's a great combination!

If you're a little skiddish about using this recipe like I was (mostly due to thinking it would be too sweet), don't be.  Usually, with this type of frosting, you would use 1 C of butter to 4 C of powdered sugar, but this recipe produces a sweeter frosting that's very similar to the type used on Lofthouse cookies, which I love.  I used 1 t of pure vanilla extract (Watkins brand) and didn't find it too sweet as others suggested.  It's perfect if you want frosted sugar cookies.

Great Icing. Was smooth enough to apply, but firm enough to hold its shape. Was very easy to pipe intricate designs. I was able to stack the cookies I made about 20 minutes after frosting but the frosting stayed soft enough so that they were enjoyable to eat. I am going to continue trying icing recipes out because i sometimes prefer glossy finishes, but I will definetly keep this one on record as an easy, go to recipe.

I've used this twice already this holiday season.  Both times I've used all butter & a little extra vanilla since I add different colors and don't need it to be white.  I weigh my powdered sugar and just follow the rest of the recipie.  I always get a perfect consistency this way.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was absolutely amazing and a simple recipe to use. I didn't end up having shortening OR butter on hand so I used margarine. If you use margarine you'll need to use less milk or none at all as it will be creamy enough. Delicious, sweet flavor. My kids loved painting their Christmas cookies with this!

This recipe is very easy to work with and is great for sugar cookies!  I let my cookies sit for about 30 minutes after frosting before stacking them (with waxed paper between the layers, of course).  It is pretty sweet, but isn't that what frosting is all about?!?

I used this frosting for sugar cut out cookies with a three and four-year-old and they both loved the taste and I loved how easy it was to make!  It stayed well on the cookies - great frosting.

I used this frosting with the "Thick Cut-Outs" from this site, they compliment each other nicely.  This frosting is very easy to work with.  The cookies not only look, but taste like a professional bakery.  I left ours simple, our cookies were all  3 1/2 inches round, so I just frosted with the white frosting, and added different sprinkles.   When frosting I put the cooling racks on top on the baking pan, still lined with parchment paper, the baking pan caught all the sprinkles so the mess stays contained, with easy cleanup.  Especially working with my little one.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  It is a keeper.

I have to give this at least 3 stars for its manageability- it iced and hardened beautifully on the sugar cookie!  However, the flavor was like sweet crisco.  Better but still not great after an extra teaspoon of vanilla and a little butter.  I'll keep looking for a better recipe for next Christmas.

Too sweet!  I halved the recipe and the texture  turned out okay, but it was way too sweet for my liking.  Even after putting the thinnest amount on my sugar cookies, it still gave me a stomache.  Still searching for the perfect frosting...

Not bad for my first try. I followed a previous reviewer and added more butter, which next time I would not do, or not the amount specified (1 1/2 C butter instead of the 1 C as outlined in the recipe).  As a result, the cookie came out more 'short' than I was expecting.  They puffed a little but cutouts kept their shapes; I used some very intricate shapes which worked great (large delicate snow flakes).  I also added the zest of one lemon and the juice of half a lemon and this gave the cookie a lovely flavor. A few other reviewers talked about the cookie being bland and this gave it a perfect subtle flavor.  They were not too sweet at all and I'm now about to frost and decorate these.  Overall, a very good cookie for what I had in mind!

Wonderful recipe!  The icing comes out a little thick, so I added extra milk.  Goes well with the "Best Rolled Sugar Cookies" recipe!

This icing is wonderful. But I was wondering if anyone could tell me why my icing never hardens? What are some tips I could use? I've tried putting the entire cookie pan into the fridge and letting it sit over time. But it just never seems to stay hard.   Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!

PERFECT!! I have been looking for the right icing/ frosting for sugar cookies and I have found it. I first creamed the shortening and then added sugar a little at a time then added milk a little at a time. came out perfect. I piped it on with a pastry bag. Looks great and tastes great too. I always use "the Best Rolled Sugar Cookies" recipe from this site and they are awesome! would recommend for decorating pretty cookies.

This is really a great recipe. You have to love sweet tastes though, as this tastes like pure sugar frosting. Kids love it, but my dad still thinks it's too sweet. Overall it's a great treat to have but not all the time. The ingredients worked perfect for me and provided more than enough frosting to use for 2 dozen cookies. I usually have to half this recipe now.

It was a really good frosting, tasted just like the stores. I made this for my friend's birthday (first time I tried this recipe, I'm such a risk taker..) and she loved them, or at least that's what she said.

This frosting was exactly what I was looking for. My kids and I were making cookies for Halloween and we needed some frosting that tasted better than store bought frosting. So I found this recipe and thought I would give it a try. It is exactly like the frosting I use to have when I was a kid. It reminds me of the Market Basket Sesame Street Elmo and Cookie Monster cookie frosting. My kids are young so their decorating skills look horrible in my photo but the taste is amazing. The frosting is thick but easy to work with. We squeezed the frosting out with those frosting tubes and squeeze tips. It hardens a little after a few hours but just a little.

the taste was good but it didn't look good, and because of it, i only used for my GHOST halloween sugar cookies, cuz somehow i managed to spred the frosting, using spatula. yea, the frosting was too thick, and couldn't use the brush. But from this picture, the dove's frosting looked like my ghosts, so maybe it should look like this. I was expecting the smooth icing, which was easy to work on & decorate nice. BUT i brought those frosted & non frosted halloween sugar cookies, and those ghosts with this frost got compliments, and i'm relieved. The taste was good.

This served the purpose I wanted it to. It is a good, basic frosting that does dry hard, as promised, and is perfect for sugar cookies. The flavor is not strong (vanilla extract flavor), so it allows the cookie's flavor to stick out while still providing moisture. This will likely become my basic frosting for sugar cookies, as I prefer a frosting to a glaze.

After reading some reviews I decided to try this frosting out. It didn't sound very good by reading the ingredients, but it turned out great. I used it on the "Best Rolled Sugar Cookies" recipe from this site. By far these are the best sugar cookies I've ever tasted.

I used this frosting with THE BEST ROLLED SUGAR COOKIES recipe and they work great together.  I changed nothing with this recipe and it turned out great.  It was creamy and fluffy.  It dried quickly and was stackable.  I love this recipe.

This is a very simple, very tasty recipe. I did halve the recipe, and instead of shortening I used butter instead. I used the exact amount of melted butter that the recipe called for of shortening and it turned out wonderfully.   As other reviews have stated, this is very, very, very sweet. But it's frosting so that is to be expected.   I will absolutely make this in the future!

Easy and tastes delicious. I used softened butter flavored shortening, since I don't like the flavor of regular shortening. Skim milk works the best along with the 5 minutes of beating to get it to a good smooth consistency.

WAYYYYYYY too sugary!!!   i had to use super strong expresso to even it out - and it didnt even work!!! im scared to take my cookies to school tomarrow......... ill say i was testing some new recipes out so bear with me haha.   okay - the reason i gave it a 3 was because i used 3 cups of powdered sugar and it was TOO SWEET! imagine how it would have been if it was 4! i suggest next time to use the same amount of everything except the powdered sugar - i would say to use maybe 2.5 cups ....  it may have been a mistake by my part......   thank you anyway kathy!!

Easy and delicious!! I substituted the shortening with butter as another reviewer suggested. I used this on "The Beset Rolled Sugar Cookies" and they were a bit hit with everyone. I found some neon gel food coloring and mixed it into the icing, and made bright pink, green, and purple star-shaped cookies!

I loved this frosting. The texture was perfect. I just used them on a sugar cookie and they set very nice to put in a plastic baggy to hand out as party favors! (hint hint) WILL be using again.

Perfect for the almond sugar cookies I made. I did cut the recipe in half and still had enough for 2 1/2 dozen. I added almond extract instead to accent the almond batter I used. My kids loved them. I bet they will be a big hit at the party tomorrow too! Thanks!

Love this - perfect! Stores nicely in layers between waxed paper. I used this on my holiday cookies last Christmas and it is fantastic.

I used this frosting for Cracked Sugar Cookies I.  The taste was very good but the consistency wasn't quite what I was hoping for...maybe it's because I used butter instead of shortening.

I've used this a number of times - I usually halve the recipe because it makes a lot. I use softened butter in place of shortening with no ill effects. The food processor whirs this together in seconds.

This recipe is yet another reason why I have to go to the gym! It is so good I could eat it by itself. I did add some strawberry flavoring and later added some amaretto. It finishes so well on sugar cookies. It would be a great cake icing too.

Very tasty for a plain sugar cookie. I gave it four stars rather than five because the appearance looked more like a cake frosting.

I also substituted butter for the shortening, and used 1/2 tsp vanilla, and 1/2 tsp almond extract....mmmm. Perfect addition to a plain sugar cookie!

Great, easy sugar cookie frosting. I am curious about another recipe here, but I've bought corn syrup for anything and didn't want to buy just for sugar cookie frosting. This is icing is perfect so I don't really see any point in trying another one!!  hahaha

Perfect!  I scaled it down to 12 servings and it was the perfect amount for 12 cookies.  I frosted some soft sugar cookies and it looked beautiful piped on the top!  The first day it was a little soft to the touch but by the second day it hardened a little and was perfect!

I made this frosting for chocolate sugar cookies over Valetine's day and fell in love with it. It was the best frosting I've ever made. It rivals the frosting on sugar cookies my aunt makes at Christmas time that my entire family fights over. I'll definitely be making it again.

When I've used Royal Icing in the past it can take up to 2 days to set and as I was decorating the cookies for the next morning I had to have something that set overnight.  This did set overnight, held sprinkles fabulously, was easy to pipe and kept its shape.  I didn't think it was too sweet, I added half almond half vanilla flavoring. The reason I gave it 3 stars is that it separated...  I added rose petal pink wilton gel coloring and mixed well and the color separated.  It looked almost marbled (although not as pretty).  I know that shortening can cause this sometimes but I was using all vegetable shortening and all my ingredients were fresh.  It was even a new pot of gel color, I had to remove the foil seal.  In reading the other reviews noone else mentioned this so I'm not sure what I did wrong.

I made this recipe for my younger siblings to decorate cookies with after i got into a baking kick afew days before christmas and i ended up making close to 150 sugar cookies. After i made the recipe i thought it had a very sugary taste to it(like eating sugar right from a spoon) and so did the rest of my family...so i added some Maple extract and that seem to give it a much better flavor.

We found this ok.  I used heavy cream and had to add more than called for to get it more spreadable.  It does harden nicely though.

Per a friend's advice, I left out the shortening and added more milk instead. This makes the icing into a glaze. It was very yummy!

Very good and easy to work with. Applied initially with the clean edge side of a butter knife but would suggest using a bag and tip for application next time. It could have looked a bit "cleaner". I also split the extract to half Almond and half Vanilla.

Fabulous - just like my favorite sugar cookies I grew up with made by my aunt. I added a wee bit more vanilla. Takes food coloring very well too. Thank you.

I added just a splash more milk than this recipe called for to make the frosting a little more creamy and whipped in texture. It turned out really nice!

Very good and simple. I did not have shortning and didn't want to buy any just for this recipe so I took a previous reviewers suggestion and used butter and it worked perfectly.

Took a little practice to get it on the cookies right, but it was just what I was looking for as far as being both Yummy tasting and good-looking on the cookies :-)

It turned out pretty decent! I didn't like that it was so yellow though, perhaps it was the shortening that I used. If it wasn't the shortening then you're absolutely going to have to add food coloring.

I made this for Christmas cookies and it turned out wonderful!  When I make this again, I will make a double batch because we had to stop midway through the cookies.  And, I used the plastic bags for piping.  It dried well and tasted very good!  Thank you!

Great icing recipe!  I altered it just a bit to my own taste ... used 4 c. powdered sugar, 1/2 vegetable shortening, 6 TB w. milk, 2 tsp whipping cream, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/8 tsp almond extract .... came out PERFECT for my big, soft sugar cookies for X-mas!

Very good! I used the sugar syrup as another reviewer posted and it came out delicious, smooth, and glossy! I wasn't successful in piping out the icing, but that is likely just my inexperience.

Wonderful for Christmas cookies. Gets slighty stiff by the next day but good for me since I was passing them out in tins and they were stacked on each other. Will use again!!

This recipe is perfection.  I just used it for the first time and I added 3 tablespoons of heavy whipping cream to the mixture to give it a lighter texture.  It was a dream to frost cookies for a change.  This one is a keeper!

I really like this recipe.  The frosting wasn't overly sweet and my 2 and a half year old son enjoyed helping me.  The only problem that I had was that it wasn't a thick as I thought it was going to be.  It is definately one that I will use again in the future though.

My husband grew up on suagr cookies at Christmas time with a frosting on them, so of course I set out on a mission to find a good recipe.  We tried this last night, and although very sweet, it does go well with a buttery sugar cookie.  If you spread it on thinly, it hardens up enough that you can stack it easily as well, which was a concern of mine for storage.  Overall, great recipe!

I really enjoyed using the recipe for "The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies."  Due to time constraints, I ended up making half a recipe and it covered about half of my cookies.  Something important to note is that you will have to mix by hand for everything to really come together well.  Also, mix the shorting and 1/2 the confectioners sugar first then add the vanilla and milk.  It worked out great!  I ended up doubling the vanilla (which was a little strong), but was fairly good.

very good!yumyum..but I only needed a little so I cut the recipie down to a 1/4.  I used 1 c powered sugar, 1/8 c butter, 1 tbsp milk, & 1/4 tsp vanilla.  It turned out GREAT.  It started out very hard to stir and then when I added the milk all good.  I also did not use a mixer and it was fine.

This is a pretty good sugar cookie frosting recipe! :) It is what I have been looking for. I added almond extract though. Yum! It was even better than just adding vanilla. I added a bit of that too though. :) it was great!

I really didnt care for the taste of this fronsting. it was overwhelmingly greasey and tasted like shortning, the first time i made it i sifter the powdered sugar into the shortning, and it would just not, NOT, cream togather, so that was a disaster. it was lumpy and a pain to pipe through a small tip onto the cookies. i tried it again, put the mixer on high and added a little sugar and then a little milk, until it was blended. i usually use a recipe with butter, but i'm now lactose intolerant, so was looking for a new recipe. i guess it just depends on personal prefrence. maybe next time i'll add butter extract and see if it tastes better.

I used this recipe last year to frost mary's sugar cookie recipe (also found on this site-it is a must try!) and thought it was perfect.  I like a little almond flavor to my frosting so I added a little almond extract to taste.

Well it's the first time I ever made frosting for cookies (they're not such a popular tradition in my country and I wanted to practice before Christmas) and I have to say I am thrilled by the result. I halved all the quantities and added lemon extract instead of vanilla. Oh, and I colored some of the frosting. And after only a few minutes after I finished frosting the cookies I could ornate them! Thank you all for a great an easy solution and for your tips on how to make it even better!

I was in need of a frosting for my gingerbread cookies and found this.  It worked perfectly.  I used butter instead of shortening and used a cake decorating tool to draw on the cookies.  Thanks for the keeper recipe that uses basic ingredients.

Great tasting and looks great on sugar cookies - reminds me of the frosting on a popular store brand cake-like cookie (Lofthouse)that my kids just love.  I always use it on our Halloween pumpkin shaped cut out cookies.

Delish!!  CAUTION: This recipe yeilds 48 servings (a double batch of "Cracked Sugar Cookies" from this site) which ended up being the perfect amount.  I followed everything to a tee and even experimented a bit. To get into the spirit of the holidays, I added a small amount (1/2 tsp) of Peppermint Extract to half of the frosting.  It was a huge hit!  I will definitely use this recipe again!

I love this recipe!  I think it would also be good with almond extract and will try that next.  VERY easy to spread as we first used it for a playdate activity!  :-)  Definately a keeper and the one I will use!

So simple, and so good. As another reviewer suggested I used butter instead of shortening.(noticed only a few flecks of butter that didn't mix in)  Was easy to tint with food coloring.  Will use this recipe again.

The recipe is easy to make when your running for time. But it was way to sweet and i had to keep adding extra milk and butter to equal it out. and it a little to thin for the type of cookie I was making. I would suggest to add a quarter of the sugar and then continue to add as needed.

This icing was really good. It made my cookies look great! Just be careful with not adding the liquid ingredients until later as it was too thick and broke my beaters.

Wasn't that impressed - maybe bc I never use shortening & now I remember why.  Frosting was greasy, melted quickly had to stop decorating frequently to refrigerate it. Made this one bc review said it wasn't as sweet but was extremely sweet - 3lbs of confectioner sugar!

This recipe was okay. I didn't have the problem with it turning brown as some of the reviewers did (I halfed the vanilla) but this icing tastes just like sugar. This frosting is a good base but it needs something else so that it doesn't taste so much like powdered sugar.

I love this icing. It was perfect for my sugar cookies. I iced the cookies, and then put them in the fridge for a few minutes to harden up the icing, and it stayed hard. Was easy to stack the cookies and not have to worry about the icing getting all over.

This frosting was great on our pumpkin cut-out cookies.  I even had a little bit left over that we used on graham crackers.  Please don't tell my mom that I replaced her frosting recipe with this one!  Very delicious!

Oh my goodness! This is the best sugar cookie frosting I have ever tasted. I use this with the Best Rolled Sugar Cookies and it comes out amazing every time and definitely use the shortening and not butter (it makes a huge difference)!!

Okay i had trouble with this recipe but i think the reason it didn't come out was more my fault.  I added all the ingredients and i whipped it around in the bowl a few times by hand and figured that was all it needed.  What i think i did wrong was i was supposed to actually whip it with a machine for a few minutes and not by hand.

This is a really good, but I'm still looking for a keeper in terms of frosting. The only problem I had was that the shortening would not bond to the other ingredients. I beat it for 5 minutes like the directions said, and it looked well mixed. When I went to frost the cookies, however, the shortening had already begun to separate. In terms of taste though, it was good.

Mine was a little thin, and I added more sugar than it asked for, but it tasted better than the sugar cookie icing recipe.
I also used lemon extract instead of vanilla.

I made this recipe this afternoon and it was excellent! I substituted butter for the shortening, which turned out good. I just mixed the powdered sugar and butter together with my hands (I softened the butter in the microwave for just a few seconds) and then followed the rest of the recipe. I will be using this as my standard sugar cookie frosting recipe from now on.

Alone this frosting didn't taste all that great to me. However, I used it to frost Soft Sugar Cookies from allrecipes and it was a nice touch.

Very good frosting recipe...Didn't take long at all to make (especially with a kitchen aid mixer) and had just enough sweet in it! Will most likely make again.

I used 1/2 cup of butter instead of shortening and only two tablespoons of milk; the frosting was incredibly yummy!  I used this to decorate The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies.  Thank you for sharing!

This was okay. I would use butter in place of shortening next time. I think it would change that waxy shortening taste into a more creamy taste.

I tried this frosting for sugar cookies, and it tasted wonderful! It was sweet, not too sweet, and then you could add food coloring to it. It was great. I'll definitly try tis again.

This was pretty good, a bit bland. I used 2t vanilla. I think I would do either bitter flavor shortning or 1/4c butter 1/4c short next time. It took a fair amount of time to dry 30min but dried nice and hard.

Great recipe!!  The frosting has a pretty softness to the colors (I used gel food coloring).  I used butter instead of shortening.  It turned out great!  It took my frosting about 4 1/2 hours to firm completely on the cookies while laying on the counter.  After that time, the frosting is still soft when you bite into it, but holds up well enough for packaging.  I packaged them in celephane and tied a bow on top.  Very Cute!!

This is my new favorite frosting recipe.  I didn't even need to add in the full 4 cups of sugar to get the right consistency. The flavor was great, not too sweet, and goes great on sugar cookies.  If decorating with sugar though, as I did, you better sprinkle it on quickly after spreading the frosting as it sets fast.

LOVE this frosting. The first time I made it it was a little too liquid-y, but the second time I added extra confectionery sugar until it reached a better thickness. This goes great with "The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies" from this site!

This icing is GREAT! I first tried it out at Christmas and then made it again today for some Easter cookies. Both times it was a huge success. It was an easy recipe and with a little food colouring it was perfect for cookie decorating :)

Really terrific!  Easy & tasty.  My daughter, nieces and nephew loved this frosting.  We used the refrigerated cookie dough from the store due to time limitations but even they tasted great with this frosting.  My search for a great cookie frosting ends here.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Super yummy. I used butter instead of the shortening as recommended. I usually don't make frosting at home, but this frosting was so good that I'm never going to use store bought frosting for cookies again! I used the frosting with the Soft Sugar Cookies V recipe, and the cookies turned out perfectly! My future FIL thought that I had bought them at a bakery!

I made this for my Christmas cookies. I used butter instead of shortening, and unlike other reviews, mine came out runny instead of clumpy. However, after adding a bit more sugar and spreading carefully to avoid a mess, it came out great. I used store-brand food coloring and it took it just fine. It took a few hours to fully harden and it only hardened enough so the cookies could be stacked. I will definitely be making this again.

I was a little concerned about it at first, but this really is the BEST for sugar cookies!  If you taste the frosting alone, it has that "shortening" taste; but when you put it on the cookies, it is AWESOME.  Not too sweet, hardens up nicely.  The best recipe I have ever made for cut-out cookies....definitely!  I only used half the recipe, which was more than enough for a single batch of sugar cut-out cookies.  Enjoy!

This stuff is pretty good!  It held color for me as long as I didn't let it get too warm.  I used it on gingerbread cookies, which I chilled in the fridge after frosting.  It hardened just fine.  Thanks for the recipe!

Just like someone else said I did not like it by itself.  However, on top of the "Best rolled sugar cookie" they were perfect compliments.  Just the right amount o sweetness.  Also, I added almond flavoring, in addition to the vanilla, and I did half butter and half shortening.  I also used heavy whipping cream instead of milk since that was all I had.  But this is a great recipe for cookies.  I would not use it for cake though.

Simply delicious and yummy!  I was weary about the shortening in the recipe, but tried it anyways.  Glad I did!  I couldn't help but to eat the icing from the spoon and mixing bowl.  I must say, best icing ever!  Much better than the store bought kind.  Simple, and easy to make!

I messed this up big time which was my own fault but I am still rating it a 4*
It clearly states use a electric whisk which I do not own so it took forever to get the lumps out and I didn't get them all out which ruined it. This is very sweet but nice if you like it like that. My husband liked it but admittedly he was not too keen on the lumps. Next time I will use a whisk and I did not like the shortening so will use butter like others have suggested.

This is a DELICIOUS recipe and works well with many different types of cookies, not just sugar. I don't like the taste of shortening so I substituted butter and they still taste good. I have a huge sweet tooth so this frosting was perfect. If you don't like really sweet frosting, this may not be the recipe for you. Now I think I will go back to licking the extra frosting out of the bowl!

Awesome recipe.  Amazing result.  While the first step (mixing sugar and shortening) was not as expected, the end result was wonderful!  I am a huge fan, and will never stray from this base recipe!  What else can you teach me to cook?

these people aren't kidding. this is a fantastic recipe. let cookies sit out for a few hours before stacking though. Mine seemed good enough to stack within about 30 minutes, but they stuck together slightly the next day.

The sugar and shortening don't get smooth, by the way, more crumbly.
* skipped vanilla extract and added lemon instead-- yum
* needs food coloring, otherwise color is ugly.

This turned out really good.  For better results use pastry coloring.  I had to use more milk than it called for, but turned out great.  Still taste soft but hardens enough that cookies can be stacked just fine.  will use again.

This was super easy to make, but mine came out thick and was a little difficult to spread.  Next time I'm going to use a glaze instead with lemon.  I think it will taste better.

We thought this was pretty good frosting.  It was easy to work with, which is important.  Sprinkles stuck to it and it took food coloring well.  I did use butter instead of shortening.

The consistancy was great and it held food coloring nicely.  The only reason I gave this a 4 was it tasted too much like powdered sugar and too sweet to my liking.  It overpowered my sugar cookies.  Perhaps I will lessen the sugar next time.

This frosting was great with "The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies".  I always make shortbread for xmas but thought I'd try something else this year.  I will use this every year now.  Thanks!  Oh, discard leftover icing in the trash!  ( i used the drain without thinking and the icing all clumped up because of the shortening!)

I give it three only because the batter was good raw. The cookies themselves are a 3 too. But the process is one if you are a novice--get another recipe!
This was my first sugar cookie with roll out and cut shapes. It was soooo sticky. When the dough wasn't sticking to the floured tabletop and counter it was sticking to my floured rolling pin. I just got frustrated and threw more than half my batter away. A complete waste of time!ps powdered sugar in place of flour didn't work either.

I think i might just like cream cheese frosting on sugar cookies.... because this frosting doesnt do it for me. It is fluffy but it lacks flavor other then being very sweet. I will probably keep searching for a better frosting recipe for my sugar cookies.

I needed something to decorate a giant cookie for the Fourth of July and this frosting worked out great. I mixed up half a batch and then colored it and decorated. Easy to work with. Thanks for the recipe.

Average icing- I used butter instead of shortening and it still had a real conf sugar taste to it. Next time I'll add more vanilla or maybe some almond extract for a diff flavor. Consistency was good though for decorating cookies.
It gets the job done!

Made this frosting to go on top of Christmas cookies. I used butter instead of shortening and I think that's why they did not dry very well. Still tasty though!

This was okay.  I think next time I'll try it with butter because this definitely left a "shortening" flavor in your mouth. Otherwise, a great frosting to work with.

This frosting went well with sugar cookies.  It didn't taste like powdered sugar, which is good.  The frosting stayed soft, although it took a little effort to make it stay on the cookie.  My children merely ate the frosting instead of putting it on the cookies, so they loved it.  This would be 5 star if it would have stuck to the cookie better, probably needs a little more milk.

Easy to make. I had the kids paint on the icing. I think it would have worked better if I had something to sqeezy the icing out of to decorate. It's really rich though, so a little goes along way.

This frosting is so good!
I only had 2 T. shortening (butter flavored), so I added butter for the rest.  It was delicious.  I spread the frosting on butter crisp cookies I got from this site.   Yum!

This is great - just what I've been looking for. I always use butter and tonight I ran out, which led me to look for a recipe with shortening. This is perfect. I didn't have any vanilla extract, but I did have some vanilla soy milk, so I used that in place of regular milk. It was yummy!

I just made this recipe for my Valentine cookies.  It tastes great just out of the bowl.  I used butter crisco.  I'm waiting for my daughter and her friend to get home so we can frost the cookies but if they don't get here soon I may just have to make another bowl of frosting. Yum!

I made this frosting for Christmas sugar cookies and it was great!  It hardened nicely on the cookies and tasted great!  I use gel food coloring and butter crisco for the shortening.  That was the only changes that I made.  I will keep this recipe for all my cookie frosting!  Thanks so much!

To give this recipe a more unique flavor I substituted a little maple flavoring for the vanilla and replaced the milk with water. It gives fabulous light flavor. Frosting still hardens normally and is easy to work with, and your frosting won't taste like everyone elses'!

I used this recipe to decorate the "Best Rolled Sugar Cookies" (also from this site) I made at Christmas time.  My Little Sister from Big Brothers/Big Sisters and I decorated these.  This does taste exactly like what you get on cookies from a bakery.  It hardened nicely and everyone enjoyed our cookies.

Good stuff.  Made mine with half & half rather than milk.  Very creamy and very sweet.  Dried to a nice consistency (i.e. not very hard, but held its own shape and wasn't messy).

This frosting was great. I cut back on the icing sugar and it was still very sweet. I recommend it for "Evelyn's Rolled Sugar Cookies" from this site; the cookies are very mild so the very sweet frosting turns them into the perfect sugar cookie. Very yummy.

Mmmm this cookie frosting is perfect in consistancy, and is great for children to decorate cookies with because it's not too thick and comes off the spoon easily.

Super sweet, very good.  I used a cake decorating kit to frost my cookies with this.  At first the icing seemed too thick, but once it started to warm in the bag it is great for decorating.

This is a very easy, very creamy frosting that would even be suitable to use in piping bags if you need a frosting that is soft to medium soft in consistency.  (I didn't have to add more milk, but then I halved the recipe, and sometimes that makes a difference.)  I will go out on a limb and say that this recipe would also be delicious as a frosting on cupcakes.  This frosting is thicker than many folks are probably used to on a cookie, but I enjoy a thicker frosting.  I liked this very much, and didn't find at all that it tasted like shortening.  I will be using this as my standard sugar cookie frosting.

I had to add more milk to make the frosting creamier, but overall very good.  This is the first time I've made frosting.  It goes great with the soft christmas cookies!

I used this on a sugar cookie recipe from Joy of Cooking and it turned the cookies from crispy to chewey after frosting.  Wonderful!

So good!  Just sweet enough - my husband who is not fond of "sweet" sweets absolutely loved this frosting on "The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies" on this site as well.

I loved this cookie frosting.  I substituted almond extract for the vanilla and this frosting got rave reviews.  I used it on "Soft Christmas Cookies" submitted by Georgie Bowers.  After icing the cookies, my kids and I decorated them with colored sugar and had a great time!

It is a great, basic recipe.  My brother's girlfriend couldn't get enough of it!  I also cut the recipe in half and it was more than enough for about 3 dozen cookies.  Thanks for sharing, Kathy!

Perfectly compliments augar cookies. So delicious that a whole batch was gone in 24 hours. Will make again and again.
