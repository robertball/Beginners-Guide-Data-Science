DELICIOUS! So easy and everyone loves it. I sprinkled a pinch of sea salt lightly over each separate candy while still warm.

This is good as is but its really easy to add more flavor with heath bars, butterscotch, or PB chips.  You can pretty much put in any candy that is solid all the way through at room temp.(ie, NOT snickers or milkyway :)   I recently did this recipe with all semisweet chocolate chips, half the white bark (b/c I don't love it) 4 heath bars, half a bag of butterscotch chips, and 2-3 cups of rice krispies. HOLY COW I could not stop eating them.

Excellent! A nice way to make a bunch of candy for gifts. These were so easy. I used a melon ball scooper because I wanted small servings. You could probably add some mini m & m's, or other candy. Very easy to make. I was worried the mixture would dry up before I finished scooping the candy onto the waxed paper. The recipe made so much that I better give some away to prevent me from eating it all.

Good, easy recipe but kinda uneventful.  I think they would be great with 1/2 tsp. almond extract.
Thanks for the recipe!

I have made this recipe for years.  My father loves them.  It does make a very large batch.  I am not a fan of chocolate mixed with peanuts, but even I like these.  I use half salted and half unsalted dry roast peanuts.

Yum; I used a mixture of chocolate & peanut butter chips with the almond bark.  I ended up with about 100 of these tasty morsels!

I completely loved how easy these were to make!  The recipe makes a large amount which is ideal if you're making holiday gift trays.  I used lightly salted peanuts, but will use regular salted peanuts the next time I make them.  Thanks so much for sharing this great recipe, Julie!
