Phenomenal - made for a pie tasting and it definately was the top pick.  Smooth maple flavor, rich, everyone devoured it.

If you like simple, not over-done custard pies, do NOT pass this one up! It really was delicious, especially with some freshly grated nutmeg mixed in, and topped with maple whipped cream.  So simple but so elegant and wonderful! Thanks!!

I'm disappointed with this recipe.  I was hoping to love it and i prepared it with a friend here.  The mixture was really odd-tasting.  I am from Quebec and have had maple-cream pie for years from my grandmother.  I think the ratio of sweet and salt + vinegar is way off.  Is it just me?  I turned out with a way salty pie :(

I made this recipe a few times and had to make a few adjustments to the recipe. I omitted the salt completely after making it twice as directed. It was so salty and so disappointing, as I had spent $38 on the ingredients for two pies to make a double batch EACH time. I found that if you omit the salt, add an extra 1/4C maple syrup, an extra 1/2C heavy cream, and an additional egg yolk it has a better custard-like consistency. Also, I find it helpful to pop the warm mixture of syrup and heavy cream in the freezer for 10-15 minutes stirring occasionally to avoid having to add it so slowly to the egg mixture so as not to cook the eggs. With these adjustments the pie is divine. Thanks for the recipe!

What a marvelous and unusual way to use maple syrup.  The taste is subtle and not overpowering, and the texture is exquisitely smooth.  I have to agree with other reviewers that there is too much salt in it.  I'd say 1/4 tsp. is probably plenty.  I made this for my husband and me, but I'm dying to make it for guests to see what they say about it.  Definitely a winner, and not difficult to make.

This pie was so good, easy to make but the finished product looks and tastes like it must be difficult.  My family wants me to make this part of our traditional holiday meals!  I'm going to try putting fresh raspberries in it next time.
