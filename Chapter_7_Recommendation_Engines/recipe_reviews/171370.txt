Kids and Hubby LOVED this. There wasn't a single leftover and they asked me to make more chops the next time I made it. Served with steamed jasmine rice and fresh sliced cucumber. LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!

Just made this marinade and I'm blown away how wonderful it is...Years ago my husband and I went to Las Vegas and had these thin Vietnamese pork chops that were just incredible...I finally know how to make them! Thank you for sharing! I'll also be using this marinade on some Mahi Mahi...Its amazing!

This was an excellent marinade.  Granted, I took a couple of liberties, like adding Vietnamese Chili Paste and using it on chicken instead of pork, but it was fantastic, and my family loved it.  They can't wait until I make it the next time; I had to fight them away from my griddle while I was cooking because the smell was so intoxicating!

Very good pork chops- These are similar to what my husband and I get at our local vietnamese restaurant.  This is our regular go-to recipe for pork chops, and is especially great on the grill! I wouldn't change a thing! Definitely a keeper!

I really like trying new recipes, and my family is far from finicky about trying whatever I put before them. I'm giving the recipe one star because it's the lowest option.  This recipe doesn't deserve it though.

This was a lot of work for pork chops, but I think it was worth it.  I substituted the vegetable oil in the marinade with hot chili oil, green scallions for the called for scallions, and I left out the salt.  Mine burned on the bottom on med-high, so next time I will cook it on medium heat with more frequent turns.  Left overs were also exquisitely delicious as well!

I can't wait until we eat this!  I've just finished making the marinate and it is EXACTLY what I was aiming for - it smells so delicious!  Summer bbq here we come.  Note: these were delicious sliced up and served with rice noodles, shredded carrot, cucumber, bean sprouts, peanuts.  On their own, they would be a bit sweet for me, but very tasty.  My 2-year old said "yummy!" and that is a bonus.

Didn't realize until too late that it had to marinate for 8 hours. Only marinated for 3 1/2 hrs and it was FABULOUS! Can't wait to try and see how great this recipe is when I marinate for the required amount of time!

So delicious and aromatic. The entire family loved the flavors. I followed the recipe but was short on time, so I heated the marinade in a small pot before adding the cooled sauce to the pork cutlets to marinate for a few hours. I used thin boneless cutlets that I pounded to tenderize. Also, I used a teaspoon of powdered lemongrass as I didn't have fresh lemongrass, and omitted the shallots because I didn't have any on hand. Turned out well. Thank you for sharing this great recipe.

This recipe is okay.  I had the servings changed, and it was very difficult to figure out some of the measurements for the smaller size (I am single, so I don't need or want 6 servings).  Also, knowing that I don't like very sweet main dishes, I did not include the brown sugar, though I slightly increased the honey (it called for 2/3 TBSP and I put in a whole TBSP) thinking that I didn't want to mess with the recipe too much.  I had two problems.  One, it was STILL too sweet for me.  Two, the cooking time was off.  I ended up with the second side completely blackened, and the pork itself was way overcooked and dry.  If I did this again, I'd eliminate the honey entirely, add more spice (either using hot chili oil or hot peppers or both), and cook it over lower heat and possibly for a shorter amount of time.

Excellent recipe even with thick pork loin. Should heat up remaining marinade to serve over sliced pork.

This was very disappointing.  The flavors lack a "brightness" and a "spicy" component that I really enjoy with Asian dishes.  I thought the lemongrass would help with the brightness, but it didn't/  There was too much sweetness and not enough balance with the marinade.  If you are going to try this recipe, I agree with another review, substitute the sesame oil with chili oil.  I would also add in some pepper and some lime.  As for the cooking time and temp - this is way off.  on medium-high heat for 4 minutes per side is way too much.  About 90 seconds each side and it will be done.
