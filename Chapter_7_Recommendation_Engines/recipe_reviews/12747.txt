This was so good, I make it a few times a month! I use bottled italian dressing, though. My 8 year old begs for this recipe all the time!

I found this to be a really great, basic marinade for just about any kind of fish.  We had it with the salmon and it was terrific.

If only it were as good as it were easy......  I was disappointed, especially after all the rave reviews.  Back to the grilled salmon we go.

This must be an easy recipe, because all I had to do was put the ingredients on the counter and tell my husband to put the marinade together before he left for work.  When I came home I had marinading salmon.  It turned out great too!  I will make this again.

Good flavor.  Realized I didn't have any dry italian dressing, used a dry veggie soup mix packet instead.  Also added sliced zucchini and yellow squash with the mushrooms.  Kids even devoured it.  Will make again.

I used tilapia, marinated in Italian salad dressing for 1/2 an hour. I didn't add water, just extra dressing, lemon and mushrooms. 5 stars for ease, 4 for taste - it was moist too. I'd make it again.

Wonderful stuff.  I nixed the mushrooms after the first time and used an italian parmesean dressing mix instead, easy on the lemon.  Fabulous, fast and easy.

Wasn't thrilled with this.  The dressing completely overpowered the fish.  I don't think that we will be trying this one again.  Thanks anyway.

We loved it! It was easy as described and the mushrooms were great. The kids picked off the mushrooms, we expected that, but they love salmon and there were no complaints from them on the fish. It took us longer to cook than the recipe stated, but my husband said the fillet may have still been somewhat frozen.  YUM!!!

to say that this is easy is an UNDERSTATEMENT! to say that this is succulent and moist is another UNDERSTATEMENT. this is absolutely delicious. the mushrooms are splendid. i will definitely be doing this one again...maybe next time i'll add even more mushrooms. i found that the ones that literally stayed on top of the salmon didn't get as much flavoring and didn't soften up as much as those that fell onto the baking dish. thanks so much for sharing!

This was good-- the best quick salmon recipe I've made. I used bottled Italian dressing, no lemon juice, and it worked. Extra mushrooms are awesome!

Wasn't amazing, but very good and easy.  Still debating whether or not the sodium content is worth the flavor.

Super easy and super good!  I used 1.25lbs of salmon and an 8 oz. box of mushrooms.  Everything else was the same.  A keeper for sure.

It was ok, but my husband and I were expecting MUCH more! Especially with all the great reviews. We made extra for leftovers and struggled to eat them. Probably won't make again.

This was not terrific. The best thing that I can say about it is that it would make a good diet food; it doesn't have much in it to make it unhealthy, and it's not awful.  It's just not at all good, either.  The taste of the lemon juice does not mingle with the Italian dressing, and the Italian dressing doesn't mingle at all well with the salmon taste.  We definitely won't make this one again.

I make this with Paul Newman's Italian Dressing - which is not dry. I put it over the top of the salmon then sprinke various spices on top and cook for 15 minutes. Then put some lemon juice over the top when I serve it. It's delicious and very easy to make. I serve with rice and a green salad. This recipe never fails!

When I don't have Italian dressing I using EVOO and any spices I have - tastes the same.

Quite easy but you would never know from the taste, enough flavor without overpowering the salmon.  I will use again and again.

My husband loves this recipe!  I added some mozzerala cheese in the last five minutes!  Wow!  It really made a difference!
I will make this again and I think that next time I will try Ranch Dressing and see how that works.

Quick and easy, but I thought the seasoning would be better suited to a different fish than salmon. Trout might be good.

I changed this recipe a little and it still turned out great.  I made a marinade out of the dry italian dressing, balsamic vinegar and olive oil.  It was very flavorful, my husband loved it.  I will make this again...

This was good but I agree with some of the others that it should be marinated at least 4 hours. An easier way to make this is to use store bought italian dressing from the bottle and simply put salmon in plastic bag and pour dressing over salmon. I have marinated over noght and it is delicious.

I'm still having trouble with how easy this was!  It took me five minutes, literally, to prep this dish and get it into the oven.  I used fresh squeezed lemon juice and it was wonderful.  My friend complimented the meal three times - I will definitely be putting this one in my recipe box. Thank you Christine.

Perfect recipe.  I used red wine vinagrette dressing and I didn't have to add the warer.  I also added some rosemary and sage.  This is a great fish recipe.

Yum!  I'm not a huge fan of salmon, but this recipe was easy and delicious.  The mushrooms turned out excellent.  I served with rice pilaf and steamed veggies, and my husband thought it was great.

This recipe needs a better name.  It is amazing.  I cannot imagine anyone not liking it.  The cook time needs to be longer 20 min. covered and 20 min. uncovered.  I would also add more than one cup of mush.  The whole 8oz. package!  AWSOME!!!

Pretty good dish.  I prepared the dry italian dressing according to the directions on the package (1/4 c oil, 1/2 c water, and vinegar) added some minced garlic and let it marinate for a few hours.

Wonderfully delicious and easy. Rather than using just mushrooms, I used diced green peppers and onions. I loved it, and I don't even like salmon in most cases!

This recipe was fantastic ... I served it with salad and steamed brocolli, and it was delicious .. a few changes ... use Pam Spray instead of butter, do not add ANY salt on the salmon as there is enough on the dressing, and add a little more lemon for a tangier taste, but it was great!

I generally steer away from recipes that call for pre-prepared packaged ingredients, but an impromptu dinner party led me to try this one.  It was absolutely delicious!  I made the dressing super tangy by mixing two packets of italian with 3/4 of a cup of water and 1/3 of a cup of lemon juice.  Next time I will try an assortment of mushrooms rather than just regular white ones.  This recipe is a gem -- thank you for posting it.

Delicious!  Very moist and flavorful, and the mushrooms add a very nice, but unusual touch. This was the first time I made salmon (and used steaks instead of filets), and it turned out perfectly. I will definitely be trying this one again!

I misread the recipe and added too much salad mix... so it turned out a bit tart.  Overall it's a quick and easy recipe... one I'd try again.

I was pretty disappointed with this recipe. I usually make salmon about once a week and this was barely mediocre. The flavor just wasn't there for me. Yes, simple to make...but not worth it.

Great recipe! I used 1/2 cup of water and a whole package of the dry dressing mix adding some oil to it.

Also , I used 2 packages of fresh mushrooms and fresh shrimp.

This was so fast and easy...thanx for that, however it is more like a 3.5 star recipe.  The salmon was tasty, but it would have been better to let it marinade in the sauce instead of cooking it right away.  If you are looking for something quick and easy, definitely a winner, just make sure your family/guests do not mind the fishy demeanor of salmon.  All in all, a pretty good recipe!

Really easy and really good.  I put shredded cheese on it like other people suggested.  I don't like mushrooms but I used some green peppers.  Cooked a little longer than suggested, just because I like it cooked thouroughly.  Served with rice and veggies!

Great tender salmon.  Got the taste of Italian dressing but did'nt lose the taste of the salmon.  Served with green beans and rice.  One of the best salmon recipes outside the barbeque.  I did however have to use at least a 1 inch thick piece of salmon.

I was hoping this recipe would be great since it was so easy to make but I was disappointed. All I could taste was the italian seasoning. When I spend money for good salmon I'd rather have a recipe that brings out the flavor instead of hiding it.

It was quick and easy, but we weren't very impressed.  I think it was the flavor of the seasoning packet.  We just prefer to BBQ fish. But if I cook it in the oven, a little salt, pepper, lemon and butter goes a long way.

I served this for a change of pace the first time my NEW in-laws came to dinner.  It was sooo good.  My father-in-law doesn't even like fish (which I didn't know) and he even enjoyed it!  It looked very elegant and tasted even better!

I feel compelled to write a review on this. True to its word, it was an easy recipe. However, it lacked the "tang" that was mentioned. It was still all right, because salmon itself already has a good flavor. I am still on my quest to find a really good recipe for salmon, though. Don't think I will make again. I am surprised there are so many raves.

Salmon does not smell fishy when cooked this way.  Also easy for lazy summer day.  I love it.

recipe is very easy to follow.  i would have thought that using italian dressing mix would give it a lot of flavor but it didnt.  would have rather used my salmon for another dish.

I must have done something wrong.  I didn't marinate the fish, and maybe that was the problem.

Easy is not the word!!!  Super-super easy!  Yes, marinate it before you cook it.  Why not?!  Followed the recipe to a tee.  Loved the mushrooms on it.  Piled them on.  This is my new "Sunday Salmon" dish.

I'm giving this four stars because my husband liked it.  Personally my favorite salmon recipe to date is the chili garlic one posted on this site.

The strange thing was I thought it tasted better the next day as leftovers.  Usually I only like fish freshly cooked.  The flavors seemed to meld like tomato sauce.  I couldn't really think of much to spice it up.  I did throw in  a splash of hot sauce and topped with some peanut oil while it was cooking.  Also, due to the amount of liquid it comes out soupy.  Maybe next time I will decrease the amount of water and use wine!

Sorry people, Frankly i didnt like the flavor of the salmon, my kids loved it, I may have cooked it longer than expected, like 5 minutes more, being i had thick salmon, flavor was not flavored into the salmon, salmon wasnt moist enough, due to my mess up of cookin it 5 minutes longer, i had to add butter on top the sauce to heighten the flaver and little more hawaiian salt!! Sorry, I Wont Make this again, I will stick with my Wasabe, minced onions, Mayonaise,Dill, Lemon, recipe,(Salmon) if anyone is interested in my #1 Wasabe/Mayonaise salmon recipe, this one is a winner!! Aloha, Marty from kahaluumauka4@aol.com (AGAIN MY APOLOGIES!!).

The first time I made this my husband was blown away. The second time I made it, my friends were blown away. Make sure you get good, fresh salmon. My baking times were a little different too- I think I baked it for 20 mintues covered and 10 uncovered, and it turned out great.

The salmon itself turned out great! The marinade (italian dressing mix), however, could have been stronger. It didn't provide much flavor to the salmon.

This was the best..And this comes from someone who doesn't really like fish.  I also used the lime juice and I put shredded montery jack cheese over the top.  Did this the last 15 mins..Turned out great.  Thanks for sharing.  Even my kids liked it.

My husband and I both agree that this is one of the best recipes we have tried on this site so far. It was absolutely delicious and we will be having this often!  I did use tilapia instead of salmon and 8 oz of mushrooms instead of just 1 cup and will make it this way from now on.

Fantastic!!! I have renamed this recipe The Best Salmon Ever! My family requests it weekly and I have passed the recipe on to several friends. Super easy and Super delicious.  I double the Italian seasoning and lemon juice.  I also have not made it with the mushrooms, I love mushrooms but just haven't made it using them....yet! Christine, thank-you so much for sharing this recipe with us.

Great recipe.  This was my first time cooking salmon, and my whole family was very pleased with the results.  I did sprinkle some shredded cheddar on the top and let it brown in the oven.  I was thrilled with how easy this was to make.  It's foolproof.  Thanks for the recipe.

I used salmon steaks, so I needed to cook longer. Will definately make again- husband and I both enjoyed it, and he's not a real big fish eater.

It was very easy to make, but we'd expected a little bit more flavor at the end. I don't think I'll use this recipe again.

This was fantastic!!! My teenage sons had never had salmon before. They all ate every bite and they were disappointed I hadn't made more. I had to cook it just a litttle longer than the recipe said.

I'm not much of a fish/seafood person, but this turned out nice. I did marinate the salmon. My mother loved it. And it was very easy! It's worth a shot.

This recipe was wonderful.  I doubled all the ingrediants and cooked the salmon skin side up.  The taste was unbeliveable and the mushrooms to die for.  My 18 month old triplets devoured the whole dish.  This will definately be a repeat in our house.

I used this to marinade the salmon, before steaming it.  It was really nice - the flavor was not overwhelming, just enough.

This recipe was very very easy, like the name says, but it was rather bland and unmemorable.  Mushrooms are a must - great suggestion.  I even put some leftover mozzerella cheese on top.  There are way too many better salmon dishes to waste a good piece of salmon on this one.  It was alright, but I probably won't make this one again.

This recipe is sooo easy. I never cooked fish because I was always afraid but I had a small dinner party and I wanted to fix something elegant that they would love and it worked! I was one of the easiest things I have ever cooked and everyone loved it! Thank you.

Itried this out and was disappointed in the results. I will try it again but with a different dried salad dressing.  The flavour I believe is greatly influenced by the type of dressing mix used.  I was not impressed with the brand that I used.  The salmon though,turned out moist and delectable but the flavour of the dressing was overpowering. Caution: Make sure you like the taste of the dressing mix you are using.

This is one of the best salmon recipes I have tried.  Me and my husband are big salmon lovers and we are always trying out recipes.  The salmon comes very moist and delicious.  I would recommend this recipe to anyone who loves salmon.

Instead of a baking, I used heavy-duty aluminum foil and baked on my outdoor gas grill for 25-30 minutes, and it turned out perfectly! Next time I will use half the water recommended, but this was very tasty and sooooo easy!

Excellent recipe... do add some time to the cooking, as I found it wasn't completely cooked at the time given. I used dried mushrooms and it didn't compromise the dish...

Barbara from Northville, NY:  My family thought this recipe was delicious.  However, I agree with the cooks who said that it needed to bake longer.  I baked it at 400 degrees for 15 minutes, then at 350 for 15 - 20 minutes.

This is a truly great recipe. I use it with all firm fish but my favorite is chicken beasts, you just have to bake 30-45 min longer. I use the good seasonings with parmesan.

Loved this!  Good enough to serve for a dinner party.  However, what is a 4.7-ounce package of dry salad dressing????  Could it be .7 ounces?  That's what I used and it works!

DEEEEEE-LISH! My husband and I truly enjoyed this extremely easy-to-make dish.  I needed to cook it uncovered longer than the recipe called for - 15 minutes covered, 30 minutes uncovered.  Worth every minute, it is the perfect workday meal.

It was easy to make and didn't take a lot of time. Also, the marinade and the mushrooms go great with the salmon. I will be making this again!

Wow!  I had an excess of salmon fillets and needed a recipe in a pinch to feed some friends.  This recipe had people who weren't really salmon fans singing its praises.  The mushrooms are a great touch and compliment the recipe very well.  This recipe is absolutely delicious, and very easy to make.

I made this a few nights ago for my family.  I should have KNOWN better! 30 minutes is far too long for salmon in the oven. The flavor was great, but the fish was tough and overcooked. What a disappointment  and waste of good money. Actually, we powered through it, as it was too late to order takeout. I happen to know salmon gets tough easily, so I should have tweaked it and lessened the time. Doing it again tonight, with at least 10 minutes less in the oven, then I'll turn the oven off and watch it after the 1820 minute mark.

I'm giving this two stars because of the ease. Otherwise I'm quite disappointed. I didn't care for the flavor, the salmon was too moist...almost uncooked tasting and that's after leaving it in for another 6 minutes. There are better salmon recipes out there. This ones lacking.

This was a delicious meal. I followed the recipe, but I also added fresh lemon zest, substituted the Italian seasoning for Italian dressing, and added a dash of dried Italian seasoning during baking. This recipe will be served in the future.

The best salmon I have ever had, including at restaurants. I think on some recipes people change things just for the sake of changing them. This one to me is perfect as is. So my advice is to make it as is first.

This is so easy and delicious!  My husband and I have this for dinner every couple of weeks!  Sometimes I will put green onions on if I'm out of mushrooms, but I think it's superb with the mushrooms! Thanks!

We have tried ALOT of salmon recipes and my husband said "This is the best of all the 'different' salmon recipes we've tried". Excellent with Spinach Salad II from this site.

Delicious. We normally make salmon with brown sugar and tons of butter.  This was much more healthy and still tasted great!

This salmon was so east and fast to prepare. My husband, daughter and I all loved it.  I did add a little garlic pepper seasoning to my fillets and tossed the water and seasoning packet, and lemon juice in a ziplock bag to coat. Excellent!

Tried this for the first time and my family loved it.  I took some other reviewers' suggestions and added some green peppers and onions with the mushrooms.  I also marinated the salmon for about 2 hours prior to cooking.  Easy and delicious.  I will definitely make this again.

YUM!  This was very good, very easy, and is definitely a keeper.  Only thing I changed was omitting the mushrooms and that's only because DH doesn't like them.  But I must say thanks for the recipe because DH told me I was "on my way to becoming a master chef".  Woohoo!!  :)

Loved it!  I did not have mushrooms - so just left them out, served a side of broccoli.  My fillet was a 1 pound center cut, which I sliced in two portions - (like dollar bills) and follewed the recipe.  The left over "dressing" I'll used on some steamed veggies tomorrow!

3.5 stars. I would definitely marinate the salmon for at least 1.5 hours and peferably longer. I marinated it for 1 hour and it helps but still needed more time. Wife thought it was a 3, but only would like it once every 3 months. I liked it better, but not a true 4-5. Anyway, thanks for something different and very easy.

I had fresh salmon in the fridge that had to be used today...so I checked this site.  I happened to have zesty itilian in the cabinet and lime juice instead of lemon, and no mushrooms.  I thought it was teriffic.  I took one reviewers suggestion of melting cheddar on top.  My kids loved it w/ peas and rice.  What a quick easy meal.

This was ok for me; I love mushrooms, but I didn't like the way they came out of the oven.  I think the sauce just wasn't as flavorful as I thought it would be.  My husband really liked it, but if I'm cooking, this wouldn't be my first choice.  It never hurts to try something, though.  Right?

I did not like this at all.  I followed the exact directions.  I thought maybe it was just me, but my husband didn't like it either.

I have to say that my husband and I were not too crazy about this dish. I have other favorite Salmon dishes. It was so easy to make but we just didn't like it.

Oh my god!  My husband and I thought this recipe was to die for.  It was extremely easy to make.  I had a recipe for something like it long ago but it had several more ingredients and steps and was always a pain to make although it was tasty.  This Easy Salmon recipe tastes even better that that old one and so much easier.  This will become a standard in our house.  I have to admit that although my 9 year old daughter loved it, my six and three year old boys took one bite and said yuck.  But what do they know?  :-)

This came out pretty well.  It was pretty much just as advertised--quick, easy, and tangy.  Just enough sour to be tangy and taste good.  I will make this again in the future.  Thanks!

This was an easy, healthy and flavorful recipe.  My "meat and potatoes" husband enjoyed it.  I also served it to friends who loved it.  I served it with a salad of mixed greens, french cut green beans.

Very, very good.  I had never attempted to cook salmon before and I thought I would have a chance because of the name of the recipe.  I didn't think it would be so tasty!  My husband will only eat salmon cooked this way!
