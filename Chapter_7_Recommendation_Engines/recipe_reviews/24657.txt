Overall, very good!  I cut the recipe in half and used low sodium soy sauce and rice wine vinegar.  Since I could tell by the recipe the amount of oil was a bit on the heavy side so I used only a Tbsp. of veg oil along with the sesame oil.  I also added a pinch of brown sugar and ginger.  Perfect with dumplings!

I served this as a dip for beef. Sesame oil is so strong!!! I added some sugar and fresh ginger and it still wasn't very good. Maybe as a dressing this is ok.

Thank you! I have been trying to figure out how to make this ever since my favorite chinese restaurant closed down! I was missing the vinegar everytime. This is exactly what I was looking for and easy to make. I also have a feeling that your slaw suggestion is another thing recipe I have been trying to find for years (I had it at a potluck and the woman left before I could ask her for the recipe)I only made a 1/4 batch tonight for 10 potstickers, but I will make the full recipe and try the slaw next week!

It sounded good but this didn't turn out the way I had hoped.  I may try again to see if I can improve it.

Not a huge fan. Too much vinegar, overpowers everything else, and I didn't much care for the sesame seeds, although I usually like them. My husband didn't like it either. Won't make this one again.

Replace the distilled vinegar with rice or rice wine vinegar.  it tastes a lot better.
