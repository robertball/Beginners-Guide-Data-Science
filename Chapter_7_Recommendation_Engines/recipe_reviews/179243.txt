These RK treats were delicious! To make them extra gooey (which everyone loves), I added another 1/2 cup of marshmallows!

These didn't turn out quite like I was expecting. They were much drier than what I prefer Rice Krispie treats to be so next time I would add more marshmallows. They didn't have all that much peanut butter flavor either. I did drizzle melted chocolate on the tops after they had cooled. Thanks :)

I took these to a cookout and they were devoured.  I didn't change any ingredients but I did melt the peanut butter along with the butter (on low/med low heat to avoid scorching) and it worked just fine.  I think it probably makes it easier to stir than when you add the peanut butter after.  I also melted some chocolate and put a coating on the top, refrigerated for a few hours, and cut into squares. I find the squares hold their shape better if you press the mix into the pan pretty firmly.

These were way to dry, not moist and sticky like regular rice crispy treats. I think I'll stick to the original.

I made these for a family gathering since Rice Krispies Treats are always a hit with people of all ages.  The peanut butter flavor was good, but I would suugest using more marshmallows since it did come out a bit drier than the original rice krispies treats.  Enjoy!

These aren't bad. They aren't my grandma's, who's recipe I've been trying to duplicate my whole life, LOL. Her's didn't have marshmallows and had vanilla, but that's all I can remember.

i have been making these in different variations for a long time. they are so good!!! just a little alternative to the regular treats. also my mother used to use cheerios instead of rice krispies with peanut butter and a handful of peanuts, it makes a heartier treat and is really awesome!

I used a HEAPING 1/2 cup of chunky peanut butter and an entire 10 ounce bag of mini marshmallows.  To microwave which is much easier, put butter and marshmallows in large microwave safe bowl and cook on high for 2 minutes.  Warning the marshmallows do expand and the whole mixture will rise so use a large enough bowl.  Stir after the 2 minutes and stir in the peanut butter while mixture is still hot.  Stir in Rice Krispies and pour into prepared pan.  Easy and delicious!

i followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great. super easy and delicious. the only reason i didn't give a five is because it wasn't quite peanut buttery enough.

These are great. I made them for our playgroup today. I followed the recipe exactly. I pressed M&M's into the top and stood Teddy Grahams in rows to decorate them.

I used this recipe to make a special treat for my husbands birthday (he LOVES peanut butter!). It was so easy and turned out great! I used a high quality, all natural peanut butter which has more of a peanut taste than regular brands. To add a little more to the presentation I cut the finished squares into a monkey and used various chocolate to decorate it. It looked almost too good to eat!

I really liked the flavor, but they were definitely too dry for my liking. I will take other's advice to add more marshmallows next time and I think that I will then be able to give it a higher rating!

I couldn't get all the Rice Krispies mixed in before the wooden spoon broke! Jazzed them up a bit with a package of mint chocolate chips on top, melting them in the oven.  My friends and I loved them!

I liked the addition of the peanut butter.  I wished they had more of a peanut buttery taste vs. a peanut butter marshmellow taste.  Overall, we liked these and they went quickly followed with lots of compliments at our family gathering.

I added extra peanut butter and it was too overpowering, otherwise they came out great. Next time, I'll just follow the recipe, though.

When I made this recipe, I used 6 cups of miniture marshmellows instead of a whole 10 oz bag. They didn't come out dry at all and the kids loved them! I have to say they were very good!

I made two batches for my co-workers and they loved them! The recipe is so easy...they taste much better when I used butter over the margarine.

Like other reviewers, I found these to be really dry and not peanut buttery enough. Other recipes I have looked at call for more butter, perhaps that's the key?
