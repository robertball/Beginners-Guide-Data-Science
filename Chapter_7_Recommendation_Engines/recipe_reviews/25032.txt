These are so good!  After reading the reviews, the consensus seems to be 1)Use a smaller pan (8x8") and 2)skip the frosting.  I agree!  I made them in a 11x8" pan and think they would be even better (thicker) in a 8x8" pan.  I did not use the frosting, instead I melted some chocolate chips and drizzled on top.  This was only for decoration, as more chocolate really was not needed.  Next time, I think I will skip even that.  My description of these bars is like pecan pie, only with chocolate chips instead of pecans and a cookie crust!  So gooey and good!  P.S. The recipe does not say to grease the pan, but I would.  The brown sugar mixture tended to stick to the pan.

Used light margarine, and had good results.  Skipped the frosting directions, and just sprinkled choc. chips on top as they came out of oven.  Simplified the recipe... I'll make again.

My son needed to take bars for a sports potluck and they were gone by the time the pan hit the table...Coaches have already said they have to be returned for the next potluck!! I didn't change anything from the original recipe & they turned out P*E*R*F*E*C*T!! Thank You

Gooey goodness!  I substituted a peanut butter glaze for the chocolate one and it was great.

These bars were super easy and very yummy!  Not at all too sweet for my family.  We thought they were a really great treat for the calories (only 170 each if cut into 24).  I did add 5 minutes to baking time and that gave the top a nice caramelized effect and browned the bottom a little.  Will definately make these again!

I added baking time to get these to set.  After cooling and cutting, the bars began to 'weep' in places which turned people off.  Flavor was good, although very sweet, but I don't think I'll make these again.

This was much faster than making cookies and tasted delicious. Next time I will cooke the bottom layer for 1-2 extra minutes to make it a little firmer.

This didn't seem to have enough crust mixture for a 9x13" pan, so I baked in in an 8x11".  These bars turn out very soft and gooey.  I also skipped the glaze, but I did sprinkle a few chocolate chips on top of the hot cookies and, after a couple of minutes, swirled the melted chocolate.  Not my very favorite chocolate chip cookie, but very good, and easy to make.

I made these in a 8x11 pan and they are wafer thin and taste like pure sugar.  I won't be making these again.

My daughter's volleyball team all loved these and have already requested that I make them again.  I did get to try a little corner, and I thought it was very good.  I used a combination of milk chocolate and semi-sweet chocoalte chips.  I didn't have a problem with these setting up.  After baking, I let these set up overnight on the counter and then added the frosting in the morning.  I refrigerated for about 15 minutes after adding the frosting to let it set up.  They cut easily and came out of my greased pan very nicely.

Delicious! Followed a lot of the comments. Doubled the recipe and made it in a 9x13 pan. Came out perfectly. Also let it set for a few hours in the pan and didn't add the frosting on top.

This was an interesting flavor. It didn't blow me away but it wasn't bad, either. I'd try them again. Thanks so much for the recipe!

FANTASTIC!!! I took the advice of other reviews and have used a slightly smaller pan (although will never go to 8x8!).. they came out thick enough for me and served them warm with some ice cream on top.   Also skipped the glaze and instead just dropped a few milk choc chips on top to melt right out of oven.   Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This was perfect! Between my husband and a friend that came over the night I made it, almost the whole pan was gone in just a matter of hours! Best thing is we have everything typically on hand, so I can make this as a last minute idea.

Yummy! These were best next day. Contrary to some reviews... I only had 1/3 cup choc. chips, so I made and used the glaze, Mmmm. Based on other feedback, I used an 8x8 dish and greased it with butter for no stick. Next time I make these, I think I'll try 1/2 c choc chips and 1/2 c pecans. Recipe is easy too, seems complicated but really easy! Enjoy!

These were awesome.  I didn't bother with the top layer and since I had no vanilla extract I tried it with peppermint instead.  I would even give peppermint a go next time.  I will for sure make them again.

These were too gooey.  They didn't set.  Maybe if I made them the day before... I think the recipe has potential but needs some tweeking and because of that, I am only giving 2 stars.  Sorry.

Really great, almost too chocolatey. I used an 8x8 pan so it would be thicker, it was just right that way.  I didn't do the glaze, it wasn't necessary and it disappeared really fast. Update: I make it whenever I want to have a surprisingly impressive and yummy chocolatey dessert.  I switch most of the margarine in the crust with peanut butter and that is the adaptation which I use every time.

These are reminiscent of a pecan bar, with chocolate chips instead.  I used half white sugar in both the crust and the filling, because I don't like a toffee-like flavor. I also lightly greased an 8x8 foil lined pan.  I don't think the icing is necessary, but it sure adds to the presentation.  I would use half the amount of cocoa, butter, and water because i ended up using 2 c of powdered sugar to get a good consistency, which left a lot of left over icing.  Since the 8x8 pan makes a deeper cookie bar, I cooked them for 20 min, then lowered the temp to 335 and cooked for another 10 (or until firm).  My husband and I both prefered these chilled as to room temp.

Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, but instead of baking the recipe in a smaller pan, I just increased the quantities of everything to 1.5 recipe and used a 13 x 9 pan as stated.  It was the perfect amount for the pan.  However, although they were yummy, the crust came out really hard and crispy.  I think next time (and there will be a next time) I won't cook it as long before putting the topping on, or maybe I'll add a little milk or less flour.  Oh--just remembered, I added some chopped pecans, but other than that didn't change the recipe.  Even with the hard crust they were deliciously gooey and different!

Followed the directions, and they were okay.  I might try them in a smaller pan next time if I make them again.  Easy recipe and there weren't any leftovers when served at a church supper.

Followed what other's said to make in a smaller pan. Never baked all the way. It was so liquidly still that we couldn't bring ourselves to really eat it. I won't be trying this again.

Very good recipe--followed to a 'T' except I skipped the glaze and drizzled on melted chocolate and coated with a dusting of cocoa and confectioners sugar.  Would make again maybe with a shortbread crust.

I followed the directions on this recipe exactly and hoped for the best. What turned out was a layer of crust, (which was decent) followed by a layer of plain chocolate and a weird spongey and sugary sweet cake like thing on top. All of the chocolate chips had settled to the bottom while the rest of the mixture had risen to the top. As someone with a sweet tooth, I could take it, but  for my other family members it was inedible.  I have gotten chocolate dream bars in coffee chops and they have all been much superior to this. Would not recommend.

Disappointed! These looked and sounded so good. I followed the recipe exactly. I cooked them for 15 minutes as they were quite golden brown so I didn't want to over cook them. I figured they would set up more after cooling off like regular cookies do, but unfortunately, they remained too gooey to really handle. They were also very thin (not like the picture at all.) The crust tasted like a layer of pure brown sugar. I didn't like it and I wanted to so bad. The chocolate glaze was really good and I will use that for other recipes, just not this one.

I really liked this recipe. I used Skor bits and added 2/3 cup of walnut pieces. Baked the bottom 15 min and the top 30 min because I like crispy not  gooey.  No icing needed. It tastes perfect. In fact it's addictive and I didn't even have any vanilla to put in. You could call this version toffee dream bars. :-) oh and baked 8x8 pan greased

The bottom crust was great. The middle layer was easy to do. I had a little bit of a hard time drizzling the topping because it was too thick. I ended up making another batch and just spreading on the top. I have to say that the taste was good because it was like fudge and everything was gobbled up. Not so sure I would do again because it frustrated me.

Good recipe but definitely needs to be tweaked to fit your tastes. I doubled the recipe, and cut down the brown sugar in half in the crust and the filling. I also put it in a 8 x 11 pan. Still too sweet for me, but my 6 year old loves it (of course). Next time I'm cutting down on the sugar even more. Cooked for about 25 minutes and was real gooey when I pulled it out of the oven, but I let set for 15 minutes and we each had a bar. Was still a little gooey but I am sure it will set up fine for tomorrow.

So, in short:
(Like everyone else has said here) 
Skip the frosting unless this is going to be made  for sugar crazy 6 year olds.
Double recipe and cut brown sugar in half.
Use smaller pan.

I did not really care for these very much.  The review that says it tastes like pecan pie but with chocolate chips is right on.  After trying them that's exactly what I thought.  My husband ate some of them but they did not go over too well.

I've tried to describe these to friends and family after I made them and I've realized that there aren't enough great words in the human language that gives this dessert justice!!!  It's just GOOD and you should make them, and double the recipe as ours were gone in a matter of a day.  I did everything EXCEPT put a glaze on top.  Only because I didn't have cocoa powder but realized that they didn't need it.  So in lieu of that I put some shredded coconut on top before baking to counter the lack of sweetness the omitted glaze provided.  Besides we're always looking for an excuse to put coconut on something.  Anyway, SUPER easy, SUPER great, SUPER!!  Going to be making them this weekend.

Yum! These were ooey-gooey and delicious! I followed the recipe as written, except for using a smaller pan (8x8) and greasing it. I didn't bother with the frosting, but will definitely drizzle some melted chocolate chips over the top next time (and there WILL be a next time!) as it looked kind of strange without anything there. Thanks for the recipe!

I followed this recipe EXACTLY.  I'm sure they would be tasty, but I couldn't try the bottom crust, as it was cemented to the pan.

These were good but the next time I make them I will make two changes:  I will add pecans or walnuts and I will use a smaller pan since they were very thin.  I'm taking them to work tomorrow so I'm anxious to hear what my coworkers have to say about them.

Loved these! Made as written other than leaving out the glaze as others suggested. They turned out sweet and chewy.

Not what I was expecting-but I'll give it three stars just because it has chocolate chips.  I made it twice but the first time they were too gooey and the second time too cakey.

These looked so good, but they turned out NOTHING like the photo. I was really disappointed in them as they were overly gooey (normally I love gooey!) and had no depth to them. I used a much smaller pan than a 9x13 and the bars still turned out really really thin. I didn't even bother with the chocolate sauce since they weren't good enough as it was. My husband loves everything and he didn't like these bars very much. I will keep looking... :(

I thought these were very sweet and wasn't expecting them to be gooey. I used an 8"x8" pan and I would probably use a smaller one next time. I also think these would be better with melted chocolate drizzled on them, instead of the chocolate glaze, to cut the sweetness. I probably won't make these again.
