Quick, easy and good.  Next time I make this I will switch pans when simmering with the other the other ingredients - had a slight chicken juice taste.

Also, I sauteed some mushrooms and threw them into the mixture - added flavor and color.

My family refused to eat it.  I thought it was OK- a little slimy for me though.  I would prefer  grilled lemon chicken with fresh asparagus on the side.

This is one of my husband's favorites!  Lots of flavor and super quick and easy.  I also add mushrooms for a bit extra.

I ended up chopping up the chicken to speed up cooking time. By the time you cook some pasta to go underneath and the aspargus the meal cooking time is closer to 40 minutes than the 20 the recipe claims. 

The dish was kind of bland, but still overall tastey I would make it again but maybe kick it up with some minced garlic and white wine.

Super quick, easy and kid friendly.  I have been making this for my picky eater from the time he was 6 until now, 24.  Great weeknight favorite & lifesaving simple meal.

I was surprised at how tasty this was. And it was super easy! I did saute some mushrooms and green onions and add it to the sauce. I thought it tasted great, my husband loved it, and even my somewhat picky 3.5 year old ate it along with my very picky 1 year old. I served it with/over brown rice.
