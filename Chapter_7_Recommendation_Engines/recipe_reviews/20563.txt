Just discovered this (at a bar) via my ex-husband.  Holy moley, that is one TASTY cocktail! I've always seen it served as a shot.  Don't be askeert of the amaretto if you don't like it (I don't) - the flavor doesn't stand out.

I totally had my doubts about this drink, I'll admit. But, it works. The amaretto mellows out the Crown, which both combine well with the cranberry. And it's really smooth. I'd make this again. It'll be nice to have a couple more bottles of amaretto and Crown to make this our Christmas cocktail this year.

Felt like eating some "red snapper" after a few of these!  Thank you!

Wow, these were very good. I used light cranberry juice to make them and by the end of the night we ran out of alcohol to make them they were that good!

Order this at a bar and pay about $6 here in ATL and the size is about a forth of this recipe. Most bars use Crown although I made it at home with a good quality Canadian blend and it is awesome! Highly recommend!

LOVED this!! Had a touch of Crown leftover, so decided to give this a shot. Went based off of memory as to the amounts of what to use - mine was a touch stronger than intended (used all equal parts whiskey/amaretto/red sugar cranberry juice) - threw in some frozen blueberries for a patriotic drink and loved the taste!

This is delicious. Next time I will add a little more whiskey, I thought the amaretto was the most dominating flavor.

As a bartender myself this drink is much better with equal parts of crown, amaretto, and cranberry juice.

I preferred this to the Red Snapper II, the additional juice gives a smoother taste.

Tastes just like cough syrup! Not something I'd give to someone else.

These were popular for a long time. They are good as shots too. I used to know a  bar owner who sold them for  $10 for the whole jigger and you could serve several people for that amt! They call em red snappers because they snap you in the butt later if you have a few lol

This is the perfect Christmas drink! I poured it in to a shaker with ice and made two martini style drinks. Not too sweet and the alcohol doesnâ€™t overpower the drink. I used Forty Creek copper pot reserve  whiskey and Disaronno. Loved  it!
