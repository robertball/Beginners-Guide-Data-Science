Great idea! My pears discolored a bit in the pot despite following the lemon juice instruction. I cored them from the bottom to keep the stems intact and only cooked mine for about 5 minutes before removing them from the heat - and they were perfectly tender without being mushy. I skipped the coffee liquor and maraschino, added a little vanilla to the chocolate and garnished with lemon zest and sugared almonds. Very pretty and delicious, thanks!

I don't understand why you don't core the pears.  This is a tasty recipe but could be easier to eat.  Next time I will core them (and keep an eye on them in case they don't need 15 min. of cook time).  Good chocolate sauce!

This was very good, but I ended up making a different chocolate sauce. I do not care for bittersweet chocolate, so I made it again with semi-sweet, a sliver of butter and a little milk. Much better. I cored the pears before cooking, and they were sweet and tender. I also garnished with fresh strawberries. Easy and tasty!

I really didn't care for this recipe, but then I'm not a huge fan of pears.  I found it a little too difficult to make for a so-so result.

These were very good but I did use semi-sweet chocolate instead of the bitter since I didn't want my guests over powered with dark choc.

I thought the semi-sweet chocolat sauce worked very well with the sweeter pears. Will be made again!

Awesome recipe even when using only 1/2 the sugar recommended in the recipe. A favorite from everyone in the family!
