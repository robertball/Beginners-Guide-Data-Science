I really love this dish. I have made it a few times. The first time, I followed the directions exactly. It had really good flavor, but I didn't like the way the flour on the chicken got slimy on the chicken. The second time I still followed the original recipe but I left out the flour and it was perfect and that's how I'll make it from now on. The balsamic reduction was delicious. I always use portobellos as the mushrooms. Fantastic! This is one of the best recipes I have tried off this website! Other than omitting the flour this recipe needs no variations! Thanks Colleen

I am giving this 10 stars!!!!! I loved this. Very easy to prepare and it just reeked of professionalism. Next time, I may leave out the whole flour thing because it didn't really add anything to the dish. Also, I only ended up with enough sauce for two chicken breasts instead of four (think I reduced the sauce too long). Beautiful recipe. Went great with a California Zinfindel (Campus Oaks, Lodi, 2000).  Also, I did flatten my breasts before seasoning and flouring so they would cook more evenly. Very  tender and moist chicken. Can you tell that I loved this recipe? I am planning on making this many more times for friends and for parties. THANK YOU!!!

I love this, it is my favorite recipe from this site! If you're not a vinegar lover I suggest using only 1/8 cup of balsamic vinegar. I love the vinegar flavor so I wouldn't change a thing. I use white balsamic vinegar (looks nicer). And... I use 1.5 lb. of mushrooms, 1 cup chicken broth and 10 cloves of garlic.

Absolutely loved this recipe!  Very impressive dish that was easy to prepare with ingredients that are normally found in one's kitchen.  Used baby bella mushrooms and pounded out the chicken so it would cook more evenly.  Serve over linguini!  Fabulous!!!

OMG! This is restaurant-quality fare for certain!  I didn't flour the chicken and after removing from the pan, I simply thickened the sauce with about 1 1/2 tsp. cornstarch which I poured over the chicken.  To die for.  My husband and I are black pepper fiends so I made sure I used a lot of it. I will make again and again.  Thanks fo much, Colleen!

This was great; cooked it with a friend.  We did change a couple of things, though.  First, we cut the chicken into strips & added garlic powder to the flour mixture.  Then browned the chicken & removed from pan.  Sauteed garlic for just a minute, then dumped in double the sauce ingredients.  We reduced the sauce for about 8-10 minutes, then added the chicken back in and continued reducing for 10 minutes, then added the butter.  We browned the mushroom separately and added them in just before serving.  YUM! **Note:I made this again and didn't bother with flouring the chicken, I just sprinkled a little wondra towards the end of cooking and then added the sauce right to the pan.  Just as good and way easier!

This recipe is a wonderful alternative to the same old chicken.  It tastes a lot like Chicken Marsala.  It is a little sweet and has great flavor.  I let the chicken sit in a little vinegar for aobut 15 minutes before flouring.  I used the whole can of broth. I though the amount of sauce was perfect.  If you are looking for a simple dinner that will impress anyone this is it.

4-1/2 stars as written. However, with a few simple additions you can swing this over into the 5 star stratosphere! No treatment of the garlic cloves is mentioned, so I peeled them, crushed and very finely minced 2 of the cloves (to make the garlic flavor more pronounced,) leaving the rest whole. Also added 2 Tb finely minced shallots, which gave lots of depth of flavor. If you don't have or can't find shallots, green onions will do.  If you find the taste to be too acidic, then look to your balsamic vinegar as the culprit. The only type to use is from Modena, Italy. Others are just imitators. A genuine Modena balsamic is smooth as silk, with no bite. It costs more, but in a dish such as this, it makes a world of difference. Once the breasts are pounded thin, cooking them for 10 minutes in liquid is WAY too much. After you've browned them, they need very little time. Just make your sauce as directed (also added a little marjoram, white pepper, and a tsp Dijon mustard to increase flavor complexity,) turn off the heat, and allow your already-browned breasts to steep in the sauce covered for 10 minutes on top of the burner. This is known as carry-over cooking, and the heat of the sauce is quite sufficient to finish off any undercooked meat. Skipping the flour coating works just fine. However, to thicken the sauce enough to coat noodles or potatoes, whisk 2-3 tsp of flour to the room temp stock, then stir this into the pan, stirring until sauce reaches a boil. Finishing the sauce

This recipe is just wonderful!  My husband and children found it had a bit too much vinegar even when I cut the amount in half.  So the next time I made it I added about 2tbsp of cream when the sauce was cooked.  It might sound strange but it really helped richen the flavor and take the bite out of the vinegar.  This recipe also works well with pounded, boneless, skinless chicken thighs.  Thanks for this recipe, it's a family favorite! :) Barb in BC

An excellent dish! I also doubled the garlic, letting the whole cloves simmer in the broth until they became soft and sweet. For a totally different taste, throw a can of chopped tomatoes in at the same time as you add the vinegar; simmer the whole thing together and you have yourself a similiar but more robust meal. Cuts down on the acidity of the vinegar too. 
A really easy and impressive dinner!

I hate chicken breasts but this recipe was great!  My chicken came out tender and moist.  My only suggestion would be to cut down the balsamic vinegar.  I put in 1/8 cup instead of a 1/4 cup of vinegar.  I was surprised on how much my husband liked it because he is such a picky eater!

I thought this was such a great and quick dish.  The aroma of it cooking made everyones mouth water.  Only thing I will do different next time is pound the chicken breast to get them really thin so they can absorb the sauce more.  Excellent still the same.

Fabulous!!! A new favorite. I read numerous reviews & then decided to do it my way.  I doubled the sauce ingredients since I wanted to serve over pasta.  This includes the vinegar, I don't know what the people that said they cut back or thought it was too vinegary were thinking, they must eat really pland food, because I thought it was good, could have even used more.  As for the comments about not coating the chicken, again I disagree.  This is how I did it:  I wilted the mushrooms & removed from the pan, added a little oil heated it to high, added the coated chicken and cooked until golden on both sides.  Added the sauce  ingredients & mushrooms back in & cooked covered about 5 minutes until the chicken was done * removed it.  Then I simmered uncovered until the sauce was reduced & added cooked pasta.  Served chicken over pasta & sauce.  Getting the coating crispy before adding the sauce keeps it from getting slimy & adds texture & golden brown deliciousness.   Will make again & again, & want to try with some thin pork chops.

I browned the chicken in olive oil instead of butter – removed from skillet & kept warm in the oven.  I then sautéed onion, garlic & mushrooms together for approx. 5 min.  I then added the balsamic vinegar & chicken broth (which I doubled to use for gravy on mashed potatoes) allowing the liquid to reduce for approx. another 5 min. before returning the chicken to the pan.  I turned the chicken a few times in the sauce & cooked covered for 4-6 additional min.  Mashed potatoes & a side salad &dinner was ready in less than 40 minutes.  This recipe is a keeper!

Excellent!! I too omitted the flour on the chicken breasts according to other reviewers and the recipe came out absolutely delicious.The only other change I made was throwing in a few extra garlic cloves as we love garlic and can never get enough of it at my house! I am looking forward to making this recipe again real soon! Thanks Colleen for sharing your wonderful recipe.

Loved it! Served over pasta. I added an additional 1/4 cup of chicken broth right before adding the butter, in order to make the balsamic mushroom mixture more sauce like. Next time I will make more sauce - it was so good!

Everyone enjoyed this, even my 5 year old. I took suggestions from other reviewers and didn't flour the chicken...I'm glad I didn't, it turned out perfectly and very tender. I also used portabello mushrooms, they have a great flavor and don't go "soggy" like regular mushrooms. Finally, I would definitely recommend sticking with the 1/4 cup of balsamic vingar as called for in the original recipe. I was just shy of the 1/4 cup because I was worried about it being too tart (based on other reviews). It definitely requires the quarter cup for full flavor. I served with wild rice pilaf and steamed broccoli. A very simple and quick recipe, light in calories and full in flavor = a keeper

Perfect and impressive. Tip: make sure ur pan is very hot when u put the chicken in the begining to get a nice golden crust, but lower heat before putting the garlic as garlic turns very bitter when burned, it will ruin everything. I forgot to add the flour but it couldn't have been any better, super sophisticated. I make this dish when I want to impress.

I really had some issues with this recipe. First, it was very bitter as-is to the point of utter bluntness. I had to add about two tablespoons of brown sugar to try and tone down the bitterness. It also just lacked flavor overall. Compare this to something like the chicken in red wine sauce recipe on this site and you'll see what I mean. That recipe (if you follow reviewers suggested changes) is full of depth and flavor. This one -- not so much. I wanted to love this recipe but it was just lacking in a big way. There are many better chicken recipes on this site.

Absolutely amazing! We had this tonight and it was wonderful. I, too, didn't flour the chicken breasts as it didn't need it. I also doubled the "sauce" and it was wonderful. One reviewer (EBSEPKE) suggested adding heavy cream to the sauce at the end to take out the bite of the vinegar and to richen the dish, and it sure did! Sinfully delicious! Served this over angel hair pasta and it was perfect. For what it's worth, my family doesn't like mushrooms so I left those out and it was still fantastic!

This recipe is wonderful! We loved it. I didn't flour the chicken and added cornstarch mixed with cold water at the end to thicken the sauce. Great and easy dinner - will definitely make it again. Serve it with mashed potatoes or rice - superb!

I made this dish last night. Following others' recommendations I too omitted the flour but added Paprika to the seasoning mix of salt and pepper. The Bay leaf was omitted also since I had run out of them.
I used Canola Oil to get a higher temperature thereby quickening the browning process of the breasts.

The one thing that I would do differently with this recipe would be to use 1/8 cup of Balsamic Vinegar rather than 1/4.
I felt the vinegar proved a little too bitter so I had to add a sprinkling of brown sugar and some honey to get it back to my taste level.
The "Cucino Balsamic Vinegar of Modena" used had an acidity level of 6% .
I also used a full cup of chicken broth as opposed to 3/4.
6 garlic cloves could be overkill depending upon your love of garlic. Instead I used 2 'jumbo' cloves finely sliced.

To make the dish more visually appealing I added 1/2 chopped Red Bell pepper to the sauce as well as sliced Portobello mushrooms and the regular white mushrooms.

After adding butter to the sauce I opted for a smoother quality with the addition of 1 - 2 teaspoons of cornflour mixed with a little water.
This VASTLY improved the sauce consistency.
Using an electric knife I sliced each breast into 1/4 inch slices and served with a medley of steamed vegetables and boiled 'baby' potatoes.

I loved this recipe!  It was especially helpful that I was able throw it together and have it on the table in about 45minutes tops.  I believe some had commented about a vinegery taste; Balsamic needs to be cooked long enough to cook off the vinegar part but leaves behind the rich flavor that you find in top restaurants.

I was nervous because I am not a huge fan of balsamic vinegar and the reviews all say this has a very strong flavor. This was sooo good! I loved it. I used jarred minced garlic and I wish that I had used fresh, but this was still an amazing dish. You will want to pound the chicken to about 1/4 inch thick. The thicker parts of the chicken do not absorb the flavor as well as the thinner parts.

I let my husband rate this recipe and he gave it a 4. Like other members he would have liked a little less vinegar however I personally think that this could be affected by the brand of balsamic you use(some are stronger than others). Other than that he really did enjoy it. I would recommend this recipe as a good break from the ordinary.

This was good, but not amazing.  Adding cream to the sauce will help it be more substantial.

This recipe has become a family favorite.  Occasionally I chop the chicken into bite size pieces before cooking and double the liquid, then serve it over pasta.  Delicious!

OH YUM! Wow, that is a good recipe. I doubled the sauce and still wanted more so will triple it next time. I didn't know what to do with the garlic so I just flattened it with a knife blade. I also took one cook's advice and added a half of a sliced white onion at the same time as the garlic. I served over pasta. This dish is simple enough for any night and sexy enough for guests. It's going into regular rotation at our house!

***UPDATE*** I made this again last night but quadrupled the sauce. Not a good idea!!! It stayed watery and really vinegary. I even tried to thicken it with tapioca starch. It did not work. Stick to the original recipe or just double the sauce like I did the first time, or use two pans so that the sauce can spread out and caramelize. Aside from last night's fiasco, this is still my new favourite recipe!

This was really good. Hubby and I both enjoyed it. I didn't bother with the flour and was worried that the sauce would be runny, but it wasn't. The only thing I would do differently next time is double the sauce and mushrooms (It was sooo good). A great recipe that is simple to make, thanks!

This was really good, but make sure you cook down the balsamic sauce all the way because it will be strongly acidic and not very sweet.

What a great find--a chicken recipe that's restaurant quality, reasonably low in fat/calories/cholesterol, and my kid likes it as much as my husband and I do!  This was almost too good for a regular weeknight meal, but I've already been requested to make it again soon.

I made this tonight and there was no leftovers!! Even my 4 year old liked it. 

I did make a few changes, but mostly everything I had in my pantry. I skipped the flouring of the chicken and just used S&P. I only had 4 cloves of garlic, but had some minced garlic in the fridge so used 2 TBS of that (we like garlic)
 I used a can of concentrated chicken broth (all I had) and mixed it with 1 cup of water, heated it through on the stove. I used the the amount of broth as the recipe called for, and added 2 TBS of cornstarch to thicken the sauce a bit, it tasted too vinegary for my liking so I added the rest of the broth and 3 TBS of cream cheese, covered and simmered until the cheese was soft and then stirred until smooth. WOW it was delicious. For a side I made plain penne with butter and parmesean but I ended up using half the sauce to top the chicken and mixing the rest in with the noodles. It was DELICIOUS. WILL DEFINITELY MAKE AGAIN!!

This recipe is restaurant quality, I did not alter anything.  I was so surprised how delicious this turned out with very few ingredients and how quickly it came together. My family came back for seconds and they cleaned their plates!! This is definitely "Company Coming Over" type of dish. Thanks!!

This chicken is amazing!  You must like balsamic vinegar in order to appreciate this restaurant-quality dish.  The sauce is very similar in taste to a marsala sauce (which I love).  I did make a few changes.  I didn't dredge the chicken in flour but I did butterfly the chicken breasts so they would be thin, tender, and have more surface area to absorb the sauce.  I added about 1 C. chopped tomato at the same time the mushrooms were added.  Next time I will double the broth, balsamic, garlic, thyme, and butter because I wish there had been more sauce once it was reduced.  The reduction was absolutely delicious!  I served the chicken with roasted potatoes and drizzled the sauce over everything.  This dish would be great with fresh, crusty baguette to dip in the leftover sauce.

This is just fantastic. I did not use the flour as others advised. Next time I may try Panko bread crumbs I find these have a crisper crust. I will double the sauce and serve over rice. So easy to prepare done in a few minutes. If you enjoy balsamic vinegar you will love this dish.

This recipe really reminded me of Chicken Marsala. It was very good! The only thing that kept it from 5 stars was that the vinegar was to much. I only used 1/4 cup too. Maybe next time I'll use a little less Vinegar.. Thanks!

Great recipe but turned out a little on the dry side.  I would recommend doubling the amount of mushrooms, thyme, bay leaves, balsamic vinegar and broth (and letting it simmer for about 18 min rather than 10 at the end).  That way, you can cook up some mashed potatoes and lay a piece of chicken on top and then drizzle the sauce on top on the plate.  I would also recommend cutting the garlic into quarters so that more of the flavor is absorbed and can also be eaten with the mushrooms and sauce, otherwise the cloves/chunks are little overwhelming.  Great recipes and will definitely make it again.

Had I never tried Lisa's Chicken Marsala, this recipe would've been a 5. (wish I could give a 4.9) It's great, my family loves it, but the marsala is just one notch better in our minds.  This recipe is a tad closer to chicken piccata with the acidic ingredients whereas the marsala is more sweet.  I'll make this again I'm sure.

Unbelievable... only thing I changed was that I added a half cup of sweet onion. and put about 1.5 Tbps of flour into the sauce after I removed the chicken to thicken it about a bit.  The checken is so moist and tender and the flavor is outstanding.  My roommate loves my cooking, but was blown over by this one- Thanks so much for the submission!

I thought this was good.  I flattened my breasts a little (just two).  And used a whole pound of mushrooms.  I think next time I will increase the sauce,  I would have liked more.  But overall very tasty.  Thanks Mandy Sue for the recommendation!!

Loved it!!  My husband is not a vinegar fan and he loved it too!!  The only thing I omitted was the butter at the end, basically to cut the fat.  I sauteed it a bit longer than suggested, and the sauce thickened even without the butter.

Great recipe and easy to do.  We opted for just sprinkling flour instead of dredging.  Nice to have so much flavor in such a short time frame.  We served ours with rice in roasted vegetables.

Restaurant quality for sure! I left out the flour as other reviewers suggested.  I also doubled the sauce and I'm glad I did because it was delicious!! I did thicken it a little with corn starch just because I wanted it thicker, but the flavor was delicious either way.  Thank you colleenlora for a fabulous recipe!

Delicious! I used jarred minced garlic and Challenge Tuscan Style butter (it was all I had on hand).
Chicken was tender and moist, sauce tasted great. It's a keeper.

This was very delicious! I'm not eating any flour at the moment (or probably ever again), so I totally cut it out of the dish and it was absolutely perfect. Followed the suggestion of another user and turned the pan up really high and browned each side of the chicken, then I turned it down to low to cook the garlic and mushrooms. Worked like a charm. The chicken got a little dry, so next time I will more carefully monitor it, to make sure it doesn't go above 170 degrees cooking. After we ate the dinner, my boyfriend had the brilliant idea of saving the left over sauce, thickened with a little cornstarch and using it on caprese salad. I had a bite and it was delicious!

This was SOOOO GOOD!! My only complaint is that the sauce needs to be doubled. It is not hard to make and looks and tastes gourmet. Definitely something to make for guests and definitely will make again. I served it over whole wheat spaghetti (angel hair would probably have been better) and red wine.

A keeper. Used a dutch oven and chicken stock, instead of broth. Had to reduce the sauce for a longer time since the dutch oven kept the juices in very well. Served it with roasted new potatoes and a salad with feta and home made french dressing. We love the balance of the tart vinegar in the chicken and the sweet vinegar in the dressing.

My DH and I loved this recipe!  The only thing I didn't do was add flour. Perhaps if I had, the sauce wouldn't have been so runny. Even runny, we devoured it and I can't wait to make it again! Served it with an asparagus recipe from this site and it was fantastic!

This was wonderful! I pounded the chicken breasts a little and added a half of onion cut in small slivers.

I was scared the balsamic would be overpowering after reading the other reviews.  To be honest, I found the chicken to be rather bland.  The mushrooms were fantastic.  I think I would marinate the chicken next time, and add some white wine to the sauce as another viewer suggested.

This was EXCELLENT!!  And it may be the best balsamic chicken recipe I’ve made. I skipped the flour and just sprinkled the chicken with salt and pepper. I also changed the process by completely cooking my chicken and removing it to a warm oven.   Then I browned the mushrooms and added the garlic for about 30 seconds and then proceeded with the sauce.  I got a little impatient waiting for the sauce to reduce, so after swirling the butter in, I added just a little cornstarch mixed with cold water, and in no time I had a lovely sauce.  I think my method is easier and there’s no chance of overcooking the chicken.  Try it!!

This is the BEST-tasting chicken I have ever made!  I make it at least once a week now!  Like other reviewers, I skipped the flour step, it doesn't need it.  I also don't use mushrooms because I don't like them. :-P

Made this last night and my husband loved it!! I added a can of diced tomatoes for a more saucy texture and since I typically like my sauces sweeter, I added a bit of sugar to taste until I felt it was a good balance of vinegar and sugar. I highly recommend this recipe!!!

Extremely yummy. I only used 3 chicken breasts since mine were huge; otherwise followed all directions. The flour dredging didn't seem to add anything, as most of the coating came off while cooking even though I tried to mess with the chicken as little as possible. Seemed like a lot of garlic but it was not overpowering at all; directions didn't say so I just slivered each clove into 4 pieces. I did sprinkle a tiny bit of flour into the sauce at the end to thicken it a bit. This turned out great and I will make it again! UPDATE: Made this again and turned it into sandwiches, which were amazing! Put chicken and mushrooms on a toasted bun, topped with melted provolone and used the liquid for dipping...this time I used portobello mushrooms too, which were excellent. Skipped the flour dredging step.

Ditto to all the raves about this recipe because it is awesome!  I'm surprised about the reviewers wanting to leave out the flour because that is what gives everything something to hold on to and gives the sauce a little added thickness.  I would serve this to guests and I know they would be impressed!

Very VERY tasty and simple to make.  I adapted the recipe to a baked version because we're watching our fat and calories.  I left off the 3 T of olive oil and browned my chicken using a olive oil spray, deglazed the saute pan with chicken stock, baked everything covered in a medium baking dish gently at 375 for 1 hour, and left off the butter. We used the pan juices as they were but next time I'll try thickening them with cornstarch.  Very good recipe, thanks bunches!

Surprisingly delicious! I didn't use the flour that was called for, but other than that I followed this recipe exactly. Very easy, quick & full of flavour. I was surprised at the sweetness of the balsamic reduction! Yummy. I'll be making this again.

Wow, I am SO impressed with this recipe!!!  I was worried it would be too salty, but it's absolutely perfect!  Because I am a mushroom hater, I left then out (Yay, extra sauce for the chicken!).  I also followed others advice and omitted the flour.  Other than these changes, I made the recipe as written.  The chicken was super moist and had exactly the right amount of flavor!  I will definitely be making this many more times, and look forward to impressing guests with it as well!  Thanks for the great recipe!  :) UPDATE 4/16/09:  I made this again tonight, but threw in sliced zucchini in place of the mushrooms, and added a little bit of flour at the very end to thicken the sauce a bit....WOW!!!!!  Best version yet...can't wait to try it with other veggies now!  By the way, the balsamic reduction is absolutely wonderful paired with a glass of Chardonney....it compliments the all of the flavors prefectly!

This was pretty good - my Fiance absolutely loved it - but I agree with some other reviewers that the flour coating is absolutely unnecessary. Initially, it fried up nicely, but as soon as I put in the liquid, all of the coating came off. This is the only reason I'm giving it a 4, next time I will just cook the chicken without the flour, and I am sure it will be delicious!

Really great recipe!  I did not dredge in the chicken in flour - I just browned it in the oil and seasoned with salt and pepper.  Then once I removed it from the heat I added 1 Tbsp of flour to the sauce to thicken it.  I used the entire can of chicken broth and did everything else as written.  Beautiful flavor!

Very good!  I omitted the flour until the final simmer, after I removed the chicken.  The flour, mixed with the broth, vingar, mushrooms, spices and garlic, made a fabulous gravy.  Served with sauteed spinach and wild rice and it was a hit.  Four stars only because I didn't follow the recipe exactly...but it was still an excellent new way to cook chicken.

Chicken Breasts w/ Balsamic Vinegar & Garlic Haiku: "'Gravy too bitter. But chicken was pretty good. Needs changes for me." If I was to make this again, I'd reduce the balsamic vinegar, increase the garlic, and reduce the thyme. The thyme and balsamic overpowered the gravy (I skipped flouring the chicken and instead added a TB of flour that I'd mixed w/ cold water into the pan at the end), but the mushrooms were quite nice. The chicken itself, having cooked it per the instructions, was done just right in texture and taste. I served it w/, as suggested, roasted potatoes, which we dragged through the mushroom sauce, but we weren't overly impressed.

My husband and children cleaned their plates and went back for seconds! Very good. I doubled the sauce and cooked in a slow cooker with the chicken for about 4 hours. The chicken is so moist and sliced super easy. At the end, I did thicken the sauce on the stove for a few minutes with some cornstarch, then threw everything back in the slow cooker with sautéed mushrooms for about a 1/2 hour. This was delicious over angel hair pasta.

I followed others recommendations and did not dredge chicken breasts but did add flour to sauce to thicken.  Also upped the mushrooms to a pound and used 16 oz chicken broth.  Was very easy to prepare and very tasty.  Think I cooked the chicken a little too long because it was a tad dry but will definitely make this again.

I used 2 bay leaves and half as much vinegar and still all I could taste was the balsamic. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  It wasn't bad, just not good either. I won't make it again.

This is great - a quick, easy, and delicious chicken recipe.  I do not like mushrooms (like most of my family), so I tend to throw whatever fresh veggies I have on top of the chicken, and they steam beautifully up there.  I have made it with fresh broccoli, green beans, peppers, and carrots.  Always with lots of garlic and onions.  I skip the butter and flour as some of the other posts have mentioned, and we serve it over a wild rice blend - yummy!

Everyone liked this when I made it tonight. I followed the recipe but the only exception I made was: After I removed the chicken, I added just a bit of brown sugar to the sauce. To cut down on the acidity. I also added a touch of heavy cream. The taste was wonderful, although it was not visually appealing. I served it with hot french bread, a tomato salad and sweet potato fries as someone suggested here. A nice family dinner.

Tasty!  We added nothing to the recipe and it came out perfect!  It's taste is richer than you would expect, also we found that 7 minutes additional cooking after removal of chicken was just not necessary.  It was more like 1 or 2 minutes and that left a perfectly thickened sauce.  Any longer and you will burn your shrooms.

This recipe was ok. I substituted some white wine for about 1/2 of the chicken stock and it gave it a good flavor. Next time I'll definitely add more garlic and serve over butter noodles. Thanks for sharing!

Colleen Lora, thank you so much for your submission!  I made this for dinner tonight and it was a big hit with everyone in my family.  Since previous reviewers stated they didn't have enough "gravy," I doubled the mixture.  I don't think it needed it though.  I ended up with a lot.  Next time, I will make it with the recommended amount.  If you don't care for balsamic vinegar, this recipe isn't for you, the flavor is very strong.  For us, this is a keeper!  Thank you, again.

We love this recipe, and my husband has asked me to make it for a dinner party. I made this recipe with the following changes: I marinated the chicken breasts in the balsamic vinegar in a plastic bag for 30 minutes. I started the sauce ingredients in a small saucepan ten minutes before the marinating time was up. I accidentally added 1/2 teaspoon thyme, but we love thyme with chicken, and I plan to make this exactly that way, next time. I used the George Foreman grill, grilling the mushrooms first for three minutes, then grilling the chicken breasts for 4 minutes.  I added the mushrooms 7 minutes before the sauce  and chicken was done. Other than that, I used all the listed ingredients, and it was delicious. I served this with white and wild rice and green beans. My mother in law, who takes a lot of coaxing to get enough protien dishes, loved this!

I used the suggestion from several people not to put flour on the chicken. When I came time to reduce the sauce, I think the flour would have helped to thicken it. So I used 2 Tbsp of cornstarch mixed into 3/4 cup of cold water and added it to the sauce after it had reduced for about 7 or 8 minutes. This thickened it up just right. I am amazed at the great flavor considering there are no onions. We will be adding this to our recipe box for sure.

I made the recipe as is but used fresh thyme instead of dry and everyone loved it. Will definetely repeat but will reduce the amount of oil and butter to make it lower calorie.

I fixed this dinner for 6 of my dearest loved ones.  (I doubled the recipe to have enough for leftovers the next day.)  I had all six family members RAVING about this dish!  It is SO unbelievably FLAVORFUL!  The garlic and balsamic together are to die for.  I served it with roasted, red potatoes in spices and steamed broccoli lightly dusted with melted butter, some of the garlic and fresh, shredded parmesan.  It was truly a hit!  (Finished it with a lemon meringue pie to cut the garlic.) YUM!

This is a delicious recipe - very simple and easy to follow. I made very little modifications - I added half an onion, a tablespoon of brown sugar, and omitted the flour completely. I felt that the chicken cooked a little bit too long, so next time I will shave off a few minutes in the cooking process. I served this meal over a pound of dreamfields linguine. The juice really flavored the pasta nicely. My husband really liked it. I will be making it again.

My son and I made this tonight.  I did not use flour.  Added a bit of cornstarch and half n half at the end.  We didn't have any mushrooms but will try this again with the mushrooms and more garlic.  We topped this over thin pasta noodles.  It was great!  Garlic and Balsamic - how can you go wrong!

Not bad. Chicken came out very tender. Balsamic vinagar was alittle overpowering. May try it again using 1/2 the amount & add white wine.

LOVE this recipe! I make it about twice a month. The only changes I have made was I add a little brown sugar (no more than a tablespoon). Just a personal preference in our household. Tbe balsamic flavor is good and strong, we just wanted a little sweetness to balance it out. I also use chicken thighs and cook the thighs with just a little olive oil and water. When the chicken is almost done, I follow the sauce recipe from there.

Thanks so much for this!!

CHEERS & GOOD EATS!!

This was a tasty dish and I'll be making it again.  I sliced through the thicker chicken breasts so they would cook more evenly.  Though we enjoyed the vinegar flavor as something different, I'll likely reduce the amount a bit next time, perhaps to 3 tbsp.  I didn't flour the breasts before browning them, but added just the amount of Wondra to the sauce at the end to get it to the consistency I wanted.  I found the amount of sauce to be just right for serving the sauce with the chicken, but would want to make more sauce if I planned to serve it over pasta.

This was great! My husband and even the kids loved it. After reading other reviews, I omitted the flour also, and sliced the chicken breasts in half length wise. I pounded them out a bit as well. I followed the sauce recipe, only adding another tbsp of butter to add depth and take a bit of the bitterness out from the vinegar. I reduced the sauce a bit longer as well. Really great, and would do this again maybe using Portobellos too.

GREAT basis recipe for a fantastic fast meal. I love lots of extra sauce, so I doubled the broth and balsamic. I was out of thyme, so I used Oregano. Piles of garlic more, a couple of teaspoons of sugar to balance the extra vinegar, extra salt to taste...and my family seriously wanted to lap the sauce off their plates! I actually did when no one was looking! Served over Farfalle with brocc on the side and my husband couldn't stop raving. Thanks for this great recipe that can impress in about a half hour.

Just tried it and used tips from other reviews.  Husband loved it.  Used Whole Wheat Angelhair pasta and the sauce hide the "healthy" pasta.  Oven roasted zuchcini and summer squash with olive oil, garlic, salt&pepper as a healthy side.  Sprinkled Wondra over chicken tenders and removed them to a covered plate while mushrooms and sauce cooked.  Will do this again.  This is a great site.

This is one of the first recipes I ever made from AllRecipes. And I keep coming back to it. I've been told by folks in the restaurant industry that the sauce it produces is better than restaurant quality. Follow the instructions to the T and you won't be disappointed!

Use a good quality balsamic vinegar – and feel free to be generous! I always serve this over linguine with some garlic bread….amazing and never fails to please!

I made this as suggested excepting the flour which I just plain forgot. I suspect it's prescence is there to thicken the sauce so add it later, or cornstarch, whatever, or not, if you like a thin sauce. I kept my breasts whole, in future I would suggest cutting them in strips or pounding them flat. The flavour of the sauce is good but needs to be carried further into the chicken. This is a pretty simple dish and you could and probably should expand this a little to include some more complexity, a reduced red wine, some shallots, white pepper and sliced red peppers. For the record I've long since discovered the error of cooking with cheap Balsamic vinegar. Do not make any recipe requiring Balsamic vinegar with cheap stuff.

Very tasty - and easy.  Followed recipe as written.  Only thing I will do different is slice garlic rather than adding whole cloves, and use fresh chicken breasts rather than the frozen I had on hand.  Served over whole wheat orzo - loved it with the sauce.  Will make again!

This dish was delicious - with a few modifications.  
If i were to make it as is, i would have to give it a 3 and a half star rating it just didn't seem to have enough flavor. 
First off i used only 2 plump chicken breasts (i was scared there wouldn't be enough sauce for 4). I not only seasoned the chicken with S&P and Flour, but also with cyan, seasoning salt, and paprika. 
After i had the chicken, mushrooms and garlic going, I then added the remaining ingredients along with 2 tbsp of honey, a few splashes of Worcestershire sauce, a splash of soy sauce, and a heaping tbsp of dijon mustard.  I left the chicken to  boil in this mixture until cooked through. I then removed the chicken and placed in the oven to keep warm. 
I then used cornstarch to thicken the sauce and poured over the chicken and served. 
My boyfriend and i really enjoyed this recipe and look forward to using it in the future.

This came out as good I thought it would by the list of ingredients. I'm a big fan of balsamic vinegar! Only thing I would do different next time is cube the chicken before flouring it, I love the crispy floured texture on the chicken. I did double the sauce ingredients, I'm a saucy lady. I didn't know there was white balsamic, so I will try that too, will look better for others. I can't wait to make this for my siblings, they will be impressed. Thanks so much for the recipe and for the good ideas.

We really liked this... Skipped on breading, and just went straight to frying the chicken. Also, used chicken tenders. Would increase proportions in the future to have more sauce - we had enough for 2 check breasts, not four.

Delicious.  I did not coat the chicken in flour as suggested by other reviewers, just used salt and pepper.  The sauce is wonderful, next time I am gong to put in more mushrooms as that was my favorite part.

We enjoyed this and will make again, but probably not 5 stars, great that I had everything in the pantry, and I served it with long grain and wild rice and peas.  It truly was a last minute "what am I going to make for dinner?" - quick go to Allrecipes (it was in my recipe box) and 30 minutes later it was ready.   I did not use the flour, and did use the whole can of broth.  I only used two chicken breasts, so we had plenty of sauce and mushrooms.  Next time, I think I will stir in some sliced sweet onion with the mushrooms - it should caramelize nicely and add some more flavor to the sauce, for us that make give it the extra star.

Not very good.  The flavors are pretty muted and w/ this much time the chicken comes out fairly dry even w/ a thick breast.  I had high hopes but was disappointed.  I will not make again.

I tried this recipe with 5 large chicken breasts, so I increased the other ingredients by about half and added a can of fire-roasted diced tomatoes, which gave it a LOT of great flavor. Served it over angel hair pasta with steamed broccoli. It made a hearty meal with leftovers for my family of 3.

This recipe depends heavily on the balsamic vinegar you are using - the better tasting the balsamic vinegar you are using, the better this dish will turn out.

This was super yummy and pretty easy to make. I didn't have plain balsamic vinegar, so I used Fresh and Easy's brand "Balsamic Vinaigrette Dressing". I was afraid that would alter the taste, but it still came out delicious! It may have actually tempered the vinegar-y taste some of the other reviewers complained about. As the recipe stands, it makes *just* enough sauce for the chicken. And only for the four servings listed. I definitely wished there was more sauce for the pasta. I will probably try to double that part of the recipe in order to have extra sauce. But this recipe is a total keeper!

It was okay, the chicken turned out really moist but the balsamic vinegar was very sweet in this. Also the picture shows this being served with pasta, while eating this I found it a weird combination. Don't think I'll be making this again.

This was super simple and soooo tasty!! Cooked it tonight for the first time.  Omitted the flour per the popular/helpful reviews, chopped up mushrooms with my SLAPCHOP! lol (I always wanted to use that in a sentence) and served it up with some broccoli and corn on the cob and a side salad.

Recipes like this make eating healthy fun and easy!

Very tasty and not too time consuming. We were looking for a flavorful chicken dish that wasn't cream based - this was perfect. The basalmic is such a nice flavor when it is reduced. Warning: the smell in the house remains pretty vinegry, but the flavor of the food is worth it.

I was very pleasantly surprised by this recipe.  I thought that I'd like it but my daughter would be "meh" about it, but as it turned out, I loved it and so did my daughter!  I did omit the mushrooms since I didn't have any on hand, but I've had mushrooms cooked in balsamic vinegar before and didn't care for them, so I think omitting them was great for us.  I did add about a quarter cup of water to compensate for the lack of mushrooms.  There wasn't a lot of sauce with this recipe, but it was a perfect amount for drizzling over the linguine.  Definitely going into the recipe rotation in my house.  Thanks!

This recipe came out fantastic.  I replaced the mushrooms with green peppers out of personal preference, and loved it.  The chicken came out tender, sweet and tangy.

I would strongly reccomend pounding out the chicken to 1/4 an inch or so.  The first time I made this I had to wait forver for the chicken to cook.  I would also suggest leaving out the flour, if you want to thicken the sauce in the end just add a tiny bit of corn starch.

This was really good.  I was out of balsamic so I used Sonomic Cabernet Vinegar.  Pay attention to the 3 minute per side.  Will make this one again! Yum!

Healthy and tastes great. Only change I made was to add some parsley and cook the chicken set aside, than do sauce, than put sauce on top of chicken. I had a nice sear on the chicken I didnt want to ruin. Meals like these make it easy to eat healthier:)

Amazing! Very juicy, tender flavorful chicken. I left out the mushrooms & added onion. At the end, with the butter, I did a drizzle of heavy cream. Will make this again!

This recipe is perfect. I almost never follow recipes, but the only changes I made to this one were to double the sauce and omit the flour. It smells awesome, looks awesome, and tastes awesome! Delicious!!!

This was fabulous! We love balsamic vinegar so this was a winner! I did change some things, per other reviews. I skipped the flour, mushrooms, and bay leaf. I cut the chicken breast in half to cook quicker, seasoned with salt, pepper and garlic powder and lightly browned on both sides. Put in remaining ingredients except the butter and simmered covered turning once until liquid reduced to half. Removed chicken. Then added butter and a little cornstarch (half Tbsp) to thicken. *If doing cornstarch remember to whip in a little cold water or broth before adding to pan or it will clump. Served over rice and steamed broccoli!

*CAVEAT*  I made a quick mock-up of this last night for dinner, using frozen grilled chicken strips, because I had to get dinner together very fast.  But apart from that, I made it as written and served it over whole-grain rotini.  DH and I both liked it a lot!  I'll definitely make it again, using fresh chicken; I might mess around slightly with more thyme, and possibly some black pepper next time.  I think this is going to become a staple around our house! It's easy, tasty, affordable, healthful, and uses things I always have in stock.   Thanks for posting!

Very good! I used portabella mushrooms. I think the trick for it not tasting to  vinegary is letting  it boil off at the end.

Thank you ...Once again Allrecipes.com (and of course, its contributors) have given me great confidence in my (if the word at all exists) chefability.  This was an easy to follow and delightful to eat tasty dish.  The photo I saw on the website suggested an accompaniment of pasta... but as we had eaten pasta yesterday, potatoes seemed more appropriate today.  This was a new field for me (being such a novice) ... to wit ... putting part of the dish on hold while I 'futz' around with the sauce.  Nevertheless ... a great and tasty dish. Thanks again.  My Yankee Imperialist New York partner (and of course, myself too) look forward to having it again.  Regards from sunny Spain  Highlander

We really loved this recipe!!  The only change I made was out of necessity - I did not have any balsamic vinegar, so I substituted balsamic vinaigrette dressing.   The gravy was scrumptious and the chicken breasts were moist and tender.  A great recipe!!  I served them with crispy potato pancakes (recipe also on this site).  Yum!

This is a pretty good recipe. Could use more veggies, perhaps some asparagus and artichoke hearts. I laid down a bed of Jasmine rice and chopped up the chicken breasts and spread it over the rice before pouring the mushroom sauce over the whole thing. I didn't use the butter, probably tastes a bit better with it. Overall a good recipe :). Thanks!  I also didn't use the flour and coat the chicken breasts before putting them in the pan, as suggested by two fellow reviewers, and it turned out just fine.

Delicious the night we served it and the next day.  Easy to prepare with simple ingredients we had on hand.  Guests we served were very impressed, and so was I!  Will definitely make again.   The flour dredging could probably stay or go, I didn't think it made that much of a difference.

Absolutely scrumptious! This sauce is so heavenly, I could drink it! I follow this recipe exactly as written except without the breading for the chicken and adding a tad bit of cornstarch at the end instead.  This is a must-have with rice.

I must have done something wrong because I found the chicken dry and the sauce a bit disappointing. That said, everyone ate it without complaints.

This recipe was AWESOME. I didn't change a thing. I used a really good, aged balsamic and tons of minced garlic. The smell of vinegar while it was cooking was pretty strong and we were afraid it would taste like cleaning fluid. But the chicken came out ultra tender and the sauce was incredible. My husband actually ate the leftover sauce by itself! I love that the ingredients were so simple and the only thing I ever really have to go out and buy are the mushrooms. This is definitely a keeper recipe.

Very easy & good.  The recipe makes no mention of cutting up the garlic so I sliced them.  I omitted the butter & used a cornstarch whitewash in the sauce at the end instead of dredging the chicken in flour before frying.  I browned both sides of the meat before sauteeing the garlic & mushrooms.  The chicken breasts I used were quite large & took a lot more time to cook than stated.  Next time, I'll marinate the chicken with the salt, pepper & some balsamic vinegar for several hours first to give the meat more flavor.

Like the other raters, I too, omitted the flour and used a little starch for thickening afterwards.  I didn't use mushrooms because I dont like them, but I love vinegar. The flavor is great, not too powerful or bitter, but I did use an above average balsamic. I paired this dish with indian spiced veggies and a side of armanian style rice.  I will def make again.

Great recipe but did change a few things. Instead of flour I used whipping cream. This helped with balancing out the balsamic vinegar taste and made it more saucy. I also added porcini mushrooms and it gave the meal a aromatic and flavorful taste and smell. I placed the chicken on a bed of brown rice and threw in some asparagus to give the meal more color. Everyone enjoyed it. A must try but with the changes I have suggested.

I just finished eating this, and it was amazing.  My 10 yr. old daughter who will never eat any protein actually had 2 pieces! I made the exact recipe except had no mushrooms in the house, so did not use them. My family was estatic since that is their huge dislike.  Next time I will make it with the mushrooms for my benefit, and they can just take them out!  
Thanks so much for this great recipe!!!

I was looking for something quick and delicious and this recipe sounded interesting. The only thing I did differently was add a little onion which I sauted , next time I will add something to make it a little thicker. My husband and I enjoyed this very much. I will make it again.

Deliciously simple - I also made with pork chops.  Just sprinkled with Nature's Seasoning before dredging in the flour.

Holy ! This sauce was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!! Even my "meat and potatoes only" husband liked it! Probably the best recipe I've ever made on here. Like some others I cut the vinegar to 1/8 c but other than that I made it to the t. Thank you for this great recipe!

AWESOME!  Left out the mushrooms and didn't have a bay leaf.  Definitely not too much vinegar.  Fantastic flavor and smelled absolutely delicious while it was cooking.  My kids ate it with no complaints!  Thanks!

This is a new dinner favorite.  The flavor is incredible. Like many other reviewers, I skipped the flour part.  I wasn't sure whether the cloves of garlic were supposed to be left whole, so I roughly chopped mine.  Next time I'll double the sauce; there was barely enough for 2 chicken breasts.

This was very tasty and different. My husband loved it, which I was a little concerned about with the balsamic vinegar.  I didn't have fresh mushrooms so used canned sliced mushrooms. I did add a little cornstarch and water to the sauce to slightly thicken. I think maybe next time I will use white balsamic vinegar so it doesn't turn so dark but I will definitely make it again.

I liked this recipe.  My husband usually won't eat chicken but he liked this one.  I would suggest using thin breats, the chicken breasts I used were thick.  They might cook a little faster and be more tender.  Overall pretty good.

Very good recipe.  Added a bit more chicken stock and 1 tbsp cornstarch dissolved in @ 1/4 cup water.  This made the balsamic reduction more flavorful and a tad bit thicker.  We not only put the sauce and mushrooms over the chicken, but on top of the side of mashed potatoes.  Will definitely make again.

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great. The chicken was moist and the balsamic vinegar was not over-powering. This recipe is also great for kids.  My 7 year old loved it and can't wait for me to make it again.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

AMAZING!  I didn't change a thing.  I'm not even a big vinegar lover and the sauce was PERFECT!  The only thing I'd change is make more of the sauce and mushrooms, and perhaps thicken the sauce a little bit.

Delicious! I didn't have any mushrooms on-hand so I followed the recipe minus the mushrooms. I did have a red pepper - so I roasted the red pepper and just let the sauce cook down after I removed the chicken. I then added strips of the roasted red pepper to the sauce/glaze - IT WAS GREAT!

This was sooo good!  I used a pound of baby bella mushrooms and white balsamic vinegar.  At the end I didn't simmer for the full 7 minutes or all my sauce would have evaporated.  I served it with a big salad with cranberry vinaigrette dressing and chopped walnuts.  I cannot wait to make this again!

I used a portabello mushroom for this; such a great mushroom.  Next time, I would not salt the chicken AND salt the flour; it was too much salt, and I even used reduced sodium chicken broth.  Followed everything as written. The chicken was very tender and the sauce had a nice flavor. Great leftovers too. Thanks so much!

I used veggie broth. I scaled the recipe to 1 serving, and I think that's why all my sauce dried up before I was done cooking the chicken! The flavor wasn't bad, but I've had better balsamic chicken.

I was very impressed with this recipe!  The chicken was so tender and the sauce was so tasty.  I used only 2 chicken breasts but kept the sauce ingredients the same (omitted the mushrooms) and even added a little extra broth and vinegar as it simmered away near the end.  Forgot I was out of thyme so I used rosemary instead.  When simmering the sauce, I whisked in the leftover flour mixture to thicken it.  I did add the butter at the end, but it was so flavorful and thick it probably would have been great without it.  Everyone loved it here, and hubby rated it 5 stars!  Served with brown rice and steamed asparagus.

This was absolutely delicious and very simple to prepare. I loved the presentation and the aroma in the house after cooking it.  The taste was super and my family loved it. It is the perfect meal for company.  I used canned mushrooms and less garlic but it turned out super.

This recipe was easy to make and turned out tasting absolutely delicious. The only part I would tweak is the amount of garlic. I put in three additional cloves for my 8 serving meal.

This was a wonderful recipe.  I liked the flour coating on the chicken.  It made it very moist.  The flavor was wonderful.  I also enjoyed the thin sauce.  I served the chicken with oven roasted new potatoes and used them to scoop up the sauce.  It was a wonderful flavor combination.  This dish will become a regular one for me.  Thanks for sharing :)

This was so easy and yummy!  I took a tip from other's reviews and skipped the flour; I also loaded up on the garlic and thickened the sauce with 2 tsp. cornstarch.  Used a ton of sliced portabella mushrooms - it was easy and delicious!  Served with a side of garlic mashed potatos.

I tried this dish as a special Father's Day meal for my husband and myself.  I was a little nervous serving it to him because he's a really great cook, but he died and went to heaven on the first bite.  The whole meal I kept hearing, "Wow, this is so good."  He announced to me at the end that it was his new favorite meal that I make.  Well done recipe, I'd say.  It was easy, but I felt like a gourmet chef.

Alot of flavor for a little effort! I took the advice of several reviewers and reduced the balsamic vinegar to 1/8 cup - it was plenty. I didn't have thyme, but I used an Italian-herb flavored chicken broth so it probably wasn't even necessary. This is a keeper.

This recipe is deliecious!!  When I made it however, I cooked the sauce for a bit longer than this person suggested and I think it needed it.  It still has a strong wonderful vinegar taste without a tangy vinegar taste.  It is a fantastic dish and myself and my husband just loved it!!!

Excellent meal! I used turkey breasts instead of chicken and it was still good. I will definitely make this again. It was easy because I didn't have to buy and special ingredients--I had everything in my kitchen already.

Recipe is delicious. I made it for the first time tonight. Chicken ended up very moist. My wife loved it and said give it a 5. I agree.

Delicious!  I made the recipe yesterday, but used skinless thighs instead because my husband is not keen on breasts.  Made the recipe exactly as directions.  Fried the thighs with the flour on them to a golden brown color.  Did not have a wet flour taste at all.  The sauce was superb.  Made angel hair pasta with it and had enough sauce to mix in the pasta and sprinkled with parmesan cheese.  End result was just wonderful.  Will definitely make it again.

I skipped the flour & used white balsamic at other reviewers' suggestion. I served it over brown rice. Hubbie says it's a keeper!!

Love this recipe and so does my husband. Easy to make and like others have said, it's like eating a gourmet meal. Cut back on the vinegar if you're not a huge fan. I always up the chicken broth to a cup. I'll be cutting out the flour in the future to avoid making the chicken 'slimy'. I always make this with pasta. Super easy weeknight meal!

Great flavorful recipe, very easy and quick. I omitted the flour and used tenderloins instead of breasts so the chicken would absorb more flavor. I doubled the sauce and put it over rice. I will surely make this again.

This was a bit of a nice surprise for me. I made it exactly as written, but wasn't sure how tasty a balsamic vinegar-based sauce would be; better than I thought! I found it reduced fairly quickly, so people should be advised to be careful lest there not be enough sauce to go around. Worth making again sometime! I served this with cooked brown rice, but perhaps egg noodles would be an even better match.

This was sooo good. My son didn't love it but that's because he doesn't like mushrooms and the balsamic flavor is quite strong. I, however, LOVED it and will make it again and again. I served it with rice pilaf and roasted broccoli. It was very very good!

I thought this was a great recipe and my family loved it. It was very simple and very quick meal to make. I did make it exactly as the recipe was except I did cut the breasts into smaller strips because they were so thick. I was afraid the large pieces wouldn't cook all the way through.

This recipe turned out great. I don't think the 1/4 cup of balsamic is too much at all. I felt like it gave a great flavor. I pounded the chicken breasts and diced up 2 of the 6 garlic cloves and pretty much followed the directions as listed. After the 10 minutes of simmering, I pulled the chicken breasts out and thickened the mixture with a couple of tablespoons of cornstarch (make sure to dissolve the cornstarch in cold water if you do this). The result: a delicious balsamic reduction sauce with mushrooms that complimented the chicken breasts perfect. I've made this twice and served over rice both times and it was delicious.

I really liked this dish. Very much restaurant quality, and so easy and relatively fast. I'd make it again and try it without flouring the chicken -- I don't think it really needed that flour.

This recipe is easy to make and tastes great!! My girlfriend and I made this dish last night and had a lot of fun. Both of us rarely cook because we are very busy so we were looking for something that would be a snap to put together and not take us all night in the kitchen...well, this dish did not disappoint. We also made the asparagus and linguine to go along with the chicken which was a nice accent. The only problem we had with this recipe is that there wasn't enough sauce. But other then that, it was a home run. We would also advise watching the video first. All around great dish!!

Yummy! After going through the previous reviews I omitted the flouring step, doubled the sauce (which, when poured over the chicken, pasta and green beans, was the perfect, light, amount), and after tasting the sauce I added about a teaspoon of sugar at the very end to cut the bitterness a bit. Turned out fantastically. My husband kept raving "I think these are the best mushrooms I've ever had!"

Nice result for being a 30 minute dish. Tried doubling the sauce the second time which didn't turn out well... at least I wouldn't double the vinegar again. My partner said the standard recipe gave a caramelized taste, so if doubling again I would cook as in the recipe and just add some extra chicken stock and flour to thicken at the end. Otherwise the picture shows the chicken served on pasta and there just isn't enough sauce, so potatoes would be a better choice.

This was super easy and oh so good!  It replaced the number 1 spot on my husbands favorite dishes. He could not say enough about how awesome it was. I followed directions but used a jar of mushrooms rather than fresh. Other than that I did not change anything.

After reading the reviews made this as directed but tripled the sauce and mushrooms. I then thickened the sauce with a little corn starch and served over egg noodles. Everyone loved it even my 2 year old grandson had seconds. This is a keeper.

I also did not flour my chicken. It had a good flavor but I wish the sauce was a bit thicker. The flour may have helped with that. I might try making it as written next time to see if it helps.

As written, I'd give this about a 3.5.  It was good, don't get me wrong, but there were some things about the recipe that were a little confusing.  

The garlic.  I threw the whole cloves of garlic into the skillet, but at that point, what do you do with them?  I didn't want to eat whole cloves, so, since they were pretty soft by that point, I ended up mashing them.  Next time, I'll probably run through the garlic press before I add them.

The sauce.  It gave the mushrooms a wonderful flavor, they really picked up the vinegar and were delicious, however, it didn't thicken at all until well after it had cooled.  I'd like to maybe try a little cornstarch/water mix, just to keep it from being so runny.

As chicken does, it took a little longer to cook, but the times listed are good guidelines.  I'll probably make this again with the changes above, because I think this could be a very good dish, but as is, it needs some tweaking.

Fast, easy, very little cleanup. The taste? I didn't expect it to be so flavorful since I used non-premium balsamic vinegar (Heinz). Used shiitakes instead because that's all I had. Put less butter and used the pan with leftover flour seasoning to pour the broth from. Thickened the sauce pretty well. Added French beans in the last 2 minutes since I was too lazy to prepare another veg dish separately. Plated brown rice on the side.

Not bad, but not very exciting. Followed the recipe exactly and can't understand all the fuss.

Pretty good, but not great. It's missing something. Next time, I will try it with the addition of sweet onions and fire-roasted tomatoes. Needs a little more *something* to it. As is, it's still a decent weeknight dinner. Just not as good as I had hoped.

I made this recipe for my wife and I tonight and we absolutely LOVED IT!  I spent the extra money on super quality dark balsamic vinegar from a local Spice and Oil shop where 99% of what they sell is the real deal from Italy.  We tasted the vinegar right there and it was delicious, so we knew the dish would be too and it was.  I can't wait to make this again.  The only thing I will do different next time is I will scoop out the mushrooms and drizzle just a little sauce.  I think I had a little too much sauce and the plate was a mess, but it was delicious none the less. Can't wait to make it again.

I was so hopeful for this one. It was so bland. I followed the directions, but there was little to no flavor. I liked the consistency of the sauce,but as far as the flavor, I don't know what I did wrong.

This is the best thing to happen to chicken!!!  My hubby hates mushrooms and will only have balsamic on his salad! He almost never eats salad either. So he licked the plate!! I love! He love it! And if he didn't I would still make it! Oh I did not us the flour on the chicken cause eww slummy, but next time way more stock cause the sauce is almost better than sex ;-)     Next time I will take a picture for sure!

This was DELICIOUS.  Loved the slightly sweet flavor that the balsamic vinegar added.  I, too, did not use flour, and found that the chicken was perfect this way.  Light, easy to make ... definitely a keeper!

Huge family hit.  Loved using fancy mushrooms instead of usual store-bought mushrooms (mini-portabellos, yum).  Serve with glazed carrots and wild rice.  Man is that sweet!

Fantastic! So delicious! Easy to make! I increased the balsamic to half a cup and decreased the broth to half a cup because we're in love with balsamic. I will be making this again in the very near future. Served it with linguine and steam broccoli. Yum!

For my part the balsamic vinegar taste was overpowering. I just might do it again but with only a tablespoon of vinegar instead of 4 whole tablespoons.

The best chicken dish I've ever cooked!! As I didn't have mushroom on hand, I substituted it with onion and still taste absolutely Devine! I added a bit more garlic too. I'll be cooking this dish to my boyfriend again tomorrow night for sure!!! I highly recommend this recipe. Even though I'm not a big fan of chicken,  I totally love this one!!! All the credit to the contributor of this recipe!

Really delicious recipe! I've never used balsamic vinegar before so I was a bit afraid, especially after reading some of the reviews. But I am delighted to say that I found the dish to be absolutely wonderful. It had a very light, clean taste; not too heavy. I will be making this again!

I did make a few changes: used chicken thighs, which I cut up into big chunks and did not use the flour as some suggested; I made 8 servings and used the "Adjust Recipe" button above to get the ingredients right (12 chicken thighs because they have less meat than chicken breasts); and I cooked some linguini and put everything into a big pot at the end.

This chicken is delicious.  I more or less follow the recipe as written, except I use chicken breast tenders, which are thinner and more tender than whole breasts. I think it is important to use very good balsamic vinegar to avoid the bitter or sour taste that some reviewers commented on.  I have made this dish, refrigerated it overnight and heated it up the next day in a crockpot for a potluck.

Wow! This is one of the best recipes I've made off this site. Great for those nights you want a "real" meal but something that is quick to prepare and cook. Tastes like something you would order at a restaurant. I skipped the flour part but other than that, I followed this recipe exactly. Yummy! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I have made this dish several times and I still always love it. A lot of people have commented about simmering and reducing their sauce to much... Solution, when you make up your chicken broth, whether it be through bouillon or can, and give yourself 1 1/4cup-1 1/2cup of broth. This way you can add more liquid if it reduces down to much with out sacrificing flavor or sauce. I also keep the heat on a mere simmer not medium low, to much heat dries the chicken out. Love this with linguine as suggested by another post. Also lovely with fresh broccoli and roasted potatoes!

I cooked this since I had all of the ingredients at home already. The chicken tasted out a bit more sour than I expected. I guess I'm not a big fan of balsamic vinegar.

Loved it...followed the recipe, I did coat the ckn with flour because I knew it would thicken the sauce.  It did it's job, the sauce was thick and rich. I used Baby Bella mushrooms it just gives it a deeper flavor. I did add a little dijon mustard...just abt 1/2 tsp at the end.  Whole family loved it, served it over thin pasta.  This would also be good with some thin aspargus thrown in at the last few minutes, we realized  this as we had it on the side this time.

quick and easy on a summer evening with little motivation to cook!  I started this dish thinking I had mushrooms, but alas, I didn't.  So I used yellow, orange and red peppers instead, and it turned out very nicely!  I used 1 cup chicken broth and 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar.  Served with potatoes.

This recipe tastes better if you add a teaspoon of baking powder to the sauce because it makes the sauce a little bit smoother on your pallet by knocking the acidity from the balsamic down.

I've been trying to replicate a recipe from one of my favorite restaurants and this comes pretty close.  I pounded the chicken to even thickness, doubled the sauce and since I don't like mushrooms, I sauteed some red & green peppers and red onions with it.

This was just ok with me. I cut the flour and used portobellos so that was a definite plus. The flavors were pretty good but I recommend checking the temperature of the chicken instead of using the time suggestions because mine was overdone. I will try this one again but it probably won't be a regular meal.

This was yummy. Skipped the flour and also used some chicken breast that was cut thinner instead of pounding it. I think I will double the sauce next time or watch before it gets reduced too much. Served it with pasta but will try the potatoes next time. It's a keeper!!! Thank you!

This is phenomanal!!!!! If you use quality ingrediants there is no way to go wrong. I doubled the sauce the first time and family still wanted more. The second time I multiplied sauce by 6 and had just enough to serve over angel hair pasts. I did find it took a bit longer to reduce but again I had way more liquid than recipe called for. This recipe is great for any day of the week!!!!

This was really good just as is.  Most of my family don't like mushrooms so I just left them out and it was fine.
You could easily increase the ratio of balsamic vinegar to broth as it wasn't overpowering by any means.  When I make it again I'll probably go closer to half and half and see what happens.  Overall it's a really good weeknight dish!!

Best chicken recipe I've ever tried! And I don't even like mushrooms! This is now a weekly meal in my house. The only change I make is that I don't do the breading.

0h my! DELISH! F0ll0wed it t0 the tee, and it is perfect! The trick here, after ready many reviews (m0stly p0sitive), is making sure ya use a high quality Balsamic Vinegar. Cheap stuff will make it bitter. Just great!
 
S0rry my ("0" butt0n) is br0ken, have t0 use the # key...

I was surprised how savory this dish came out, and enjoyed it.  I did half the balsamic vinegar though and cut down on the butter like others suggested.  It's a keeper.

Made this last night for something different than the same old chicken.  Omitted the mushrooms since the man hates them (i would of loveeed it) followed everything else along with a few reviewer modifications.  Used only 2 large chicken breasts pounded flat. Used lots of garlic and added a half a can of diced tomatoes/juice.  It was perfect!

Very good--it's a nice, savory dish I've made four or five times, although I've usually made with dried (and rehydrated) shiitake mushrooms--they come out great!

This is a good recipe.  I think the prep time is longer if you coat the chicken with flour.  If in a hurry and want to make a quick main course and have time to prepare the sides, just throw the chicken in the pan and follow the rest of the directions. Great topped with angel hair pasta and green beans.

One of my very favorite recipes, from this site, or anywhere! We make this at least once a month, and I'm getting ready to make it tonight. 

I double the sauce ingredients, because it's so good, but I think dredging the chicken in flour is totally unnecessary.  I'm not a huge mushroom fan, so I just use a slotted spoon, and put them all on my husband's plate.

We serve it over a side of pasta, tossed with a litle garlic, olive oil and Parmesan.

Seriously delicious!

Absolutely delicious! I added more garlic and nixed the mushrooms just bc I'm not a fan.

This dish was so easy to make! I skipped the flour and cut the chicken into chunks.  I cooked the complete dish for 5 minutes covered, the about 15 minutes uncovered to reduce the sauce. I never removed the chicken, kept it to a one pan dish. Then I added the butter and served. My no mushrooms husband even loved it!

This was awesome!  I made it to the recipe, minus a few mushrooms (my kids and I aren't big fans of them, but husband likes them, so I only put in a couple of them in, and instead of just slicing them, I diced them).  Other than that, the chicken and the sauce turned out perfect!!  I served Angel Hair pasta on the side with fresh steamed Broccoli.  For picky eaters (my kids and I), all four of us gave this two thumbs up!  A keeper!!

Delicious! Both of my kids devoured this dish. The 7 year old (who likes his food bland) did not care for the sauce, but the 4 year old loved it. The nice thing about this dish is that you can serve the chicken with or without sauce depending on the tastes of your table. I ate mine with both the sauce and mushrooms and it was wonderful! Also loved how easy and fast this dish was to prepare. I followed recipe except I didn't dredge in flour - seemed unnecessary. It was so yummy, I don't think it needs the flour coating (or the time and mess to apply it).

I loved this one!  My kids weren't keen on the mushrooms as I expected, but they could pick through them, which meant more for me!  As others did, I reduced the amount of vinegar to just over 1/8 cup and added a bit more broth as I was cooking 5 chicken breasts.  I also pounded the chicken so it was even thickness.  This recipe doesn't require a lot of prep (especially when you buy pre-washed & sliced mushrooms) and can be made with ingredients I usually have on hand.  I will be making this one again for sure.

Amazing! This is recipe has become a staple at our house; one of my husband's favorite, and even my toddler devours it. It is delicious and fairly easy to make as it is written, but I have made the following modifications: I always chop my chicken into bite-size pieces so it cooks faster. Fresh mushrooms obviously are best (especially portabellas), but drained canned work just fine (and they're cheaper!). I also serve it over spaghetti noodles tossed in a bit of olive oil, Parmesan cheese, and a bit of Italian seasoning. If you are REALLY short on time, just use a box mix of Parmesan noodles.

I loved this recipe.  It was very tasty.  My husband thought it was good but not great.  Definitely a recipe I would make again.  Oh, and I followed the recipe to a T!  I served it with noodles with olive oil and it was a great pair!!!  Highly recommend - but as another reviewer said if you aren't a vinegar lover, then this may not be the best recipe for you.

I've been making this for 10+ years & shared with a chef at the Viking cooking school.  She now uses as one of the recipes in her class!  It's that good!
I like to add extra mushrooms and make more sauce.  Great served with mashed potatoes and a side of asparagus!

My whole family loved this recipe!  The changes I made: I cut chicken into cubes before cooking (just more kid-friendly), added some chopped green onions, double the garlic, and did not add the butter at the end to keep it healthier.  Next time, I think I will add some spinach and finely sliced carrots to squeeze in some more veggies. :)

This was a delicious quick and easy recipe.  I cut the breasts in half and pounded thin so I only needed 2 to feed the 3 of us.  I served with roasted potatoes, but next time will be angel hair pasta (will be much better with the sauce).

I was so surprised how good this turned out! I have a slight aversion to cooking chicken because I had a bad experience at a cookout (food poisoning). Now that I am starting to try to cook more creatively, I decided to check this one out. I had to leave out the mushrooms (cry) because hubby doesn't like them. But the rest of the recipe I followed exactly, and we ALL loved it, even the kiddo. Thank you for such a delicious, easy chicken recipe, will be using this one again for sure.

Fabulous recipe that is simple, quick, and easy to prepare. I have served it as pictured (with pasta and asparagus), but find there's not enough sauce for the pasta. However, the asparagus does make an excellent pairing for a complete meal.

Made this for Valentine's Day dinner - hubby and I loved it!  I didn't add mushrooms as I don't like them (but may try them next time), but even without it, it was amazing!  I didn't think the vinegar flavor was dominant at all.  I used chicken breast tenderloins instead of whole breasts based on reviews about pounding them flat, etc.  I think this worked great but you should cut back on the simmering in the sauce for 3-5 minutes.  I served with roasted red potatoes as suggested, which was a nice complement.  I will definitely make it again!

Made this for 91 year old mother-in-law, who is having a hard time wanting to do any cooking.  She loved it and will eat leftovers again today.  It wasn't very difficult to make, but I didn't think it was an absolutely wonderful dish-probably just my tastes.  I'm not sure I'd make it again.  But we did enjoy it for the one meal.

This was really good, but next time I would double the sauce as there wasn't enough to go over the rice.  This would also be really good with pork chops!

As others I did not use flour on the chicken . I did put a couple of tablespoons in to thicken up the sauce a little at the very end. I also doubled the garlic and used 2 packages of portabella mushrooms, 20 oz. This recipe is fantastic. Thank you for a keeper.

This was awesome!! We've made it several times--the last time we ran out of balsamic vinegar so we subbed Ken's Balsamic & Basil Vinaigrette and it was also fantastic! I always double the sauce, and if I have them on hand, the mushrooms. YuM!

Followed directions exactly.  Next time will pound chicken breast to even the thickness before seasoning and dredging in flour.  I'll try WHITE balsalmic vinegar.

This was delicious, even my 4-year-old grandson asked for seconds.  I served it with brown rice and a salad.  Very easy meal.

Really good.  I will double the sauce next time.  It was so good you could drink it.  Some complained about the chicken being dry.  If you make sure your oil is hot enough to sear the chicken, it will seal in the juices.  Mine was very moist and tender.

BIG HIT at my dinner party...I did change some though. I did not use mushrooms (no one likes them here) and I did not use the flour. The chicken turned out so moist and delicious all the guest had good things to say! My husband finally rated a recipe with 5 stars for the first time in 3 years!!!!!!

A little balsamic goes a long way, in my opinion. We liked it, but felt it was a little too sweet, and I will cut back on the balsamic next time. Also, I think simmering the chicken for 10 minutes after it already cooked on one side for 3, causes it to be over cooked. After flipping the chicken, I cooked it for another 2 - 3 minutes, then took it out of the pan, kept it warm on a plate, and made the pan sauce seperately....poured over chicken and there was plenty of flavor w/o the dredge/crust getting soggy in the pan. Will make this again; I'll just tweak it a little for our preference.

SO delish! This is a fast favorite of ours & one I make at least 2x a month. I omit the flour & use sliced portobello mushrooms. Love to serve it with fresh baked asparagus & roasted red potatoes. A yummy dinner that can be on the table in 40 minutes or less (if you don't do roasted potatoes).

OMG! This was SOOO delicious! I thought the balsamic would be over powering and really come through, but all of the flavors blended so well together that it was just MAGIC! The only thing I did differently is cooked it for much longer on low heat and added flour to the sauce to thicken it up. I tripled the garlic, added more balsamic, added 4 bay leaves and just eye balled the thyme. It was INCREDIBLE! I am going to be making this a staple in my repertoire.

For garlic lovers, this is an ideal recipe.  Next time I make this, I will use 3 cloves instead of 6.  Garlic was somewhat overpowering.  The balsamic vinegar & mushrooms were a lovely combination with the chicken!

This was very easy to make, but it lacked flavor.  The vinegar was over powering.  This would be much better and just as easy if the thyme is substituted with fresh rosemary and dried cherries added in at the simmering stage.

This recipe is outstanding. It is quick & easy plus, the flavor of the mushroom gravy had delightfully tart, earthy flavors.    The overall tastes of this recipe is a bit different from the usual fare. So, I could serve this on a weekly basis, or I could use it like a baseball pitcher uses a "change up" pitch, just to keep my family form getting in the usual dinner rut.    Furthermore, it could easily be dressed up for a candlelit dinner. Maybe some spaghetti, on the side, mixed with parsley & topped with big shreds of parmesan cheese cut from an old potato slicer.    I don't make changes to recipes until I make them at least once, but this time all I had was canned mushrooms & it still came out fine.

This is  a very yummy meal. The sauce is so good and adds so much to the chicken. The only things I do different is to pound the chicken and double the sauce.

Nice flavor.  We both liked this. Because I was hurrying it along, I did add a little corn starch slurry.  Worked like a charm.  Also sliced the chicken breast and lightly flattened it to get more of the balsamic flavor into the breasts.   Thank you for sharing!

This was absolutely phenomenal!! My entire extended family loved it, from our 22 month old son to my 89 year old grandma! I took the advice of several others and did the following: omitted the flour, sliced the chicken breasts into strips, used portobello mushrooms, added 1 1/2 teaspoons of cornstarch mixed with a little water to the sauce mixture to help thicken it and I also used 10 cloves of garlic. The sauce was still a bit too thin, so I may not have reduced it long enough..will try that next time. The chicken was so moist and flavorful and it was honestly so tender, you could cut it with a fork! Served with butter and garlic rice and fresh steamed broccoli. Yummy!

Delicious and simple!  I wanted to make just enough for 2 people so I only used 2 chicken breasts.  Although many said to omit the flour, I did coat the chicken with flour and it came out great.  I kept the sauce proportions the same and even doubled the mushrooms!  When I removed the chicken from the sauce, I added a slurry (cornstarch and water) to the sauce to thicken it up a little bit.  Then I added the chicken back the pan and stirred everything together.  The taste, texture, etc. was divine.  This is great for a week night because it's fancier but also quick to make and most of the ingredients are ones that you would have on hand.

I followed this recipe but made a couple of changes.  I used 1/2 cup of balsamic vinigar; 1 14-1/4 oz can of chic broth and a 4.5 oz jar of mushrooms with liquid.  I did not coat the chicken with flour but added 1 tbsp of corn starch in 1/2 cup water at the end to thicken.  It was delicious and my husband raved about it as well.  This will be on my list of favs.  Thanks for the inspiration.

only used 2 breasts but kept with the original amount of sauce, also added onions.  Skipped flouring the breasts and added flour to my chicken broth.  Came out awesome! Made oven roasted potatoes and steamed broccoli to go with it.

This was great! Made this for a friend and myself tonight and I'm always worried about feeding people recipes I've never tried before, but he loved it! I wouldn't change anything, except maybe add more mushrooms, but only because I'm in love with them.

VERRRRRY GOOD!   Once you make it, you've earned bragging rights over your  newly acquired superb high class chef skills! I didn't have chicken broth on hand... so I used a lipton chicken noodle soup pkg and strained the broth and discarded the noodles and it was just as good! I also didn't have any fresh mushrooms on hand... only canned and, again, FABOULOUS!   I can't wait to try it with all the RIGHT ingredients. Served with stuffing and peas. YUM-O.

Great dish!  I didn't have chicken broth, so it was not exact, but it was wonderful!  I added some milk at the end, and was soo delicious.  I will again exactly as the recipe states, only like everyone else, I do feel it was a little too much vinegar.  This will definitely become a regular in our home!

I agree with other reviewers, skip the flour or use thin breasts and cook them with the flour coating separately. The coating got too mushy when it I cooked it with the liquid. The sauce was amazing, though, I would double it, though to have plenty!

At first I thought the sauce was going to taste to strongly of balsamic vinegar, but once the chicken was added back to the sauce and the tastes mingled more i realized it was just right.  My family ate this up the first night and we ate the leftovers the next night...still as good as the first night.  The only change was no Bay leaf or mushrooms on hand so I substitued thinly sliced bell pepper and onion.  Also doubled the sauce and served over penne pasta.  Thanks for the recipe!

My husband and I LOVED this recipe!  It will go into regular circulation in my meal plans.  I would only suggest it, however, if you are a big fan of balsamic vinegar and I would recommend spending the extra money to get a quality, aged balsamic.  You get what you pay for and you'll be able to taste the difference in this recipe.  I halved the recipe for just the two of us but used the full amount of mushrooms because we love mushrooms.  I served it with oven roasted potatoes and steamed asparagus.  Together, it was an incredible meal.

This dish was great.  My boys are not big vinegar fans, but they loved this.  I used a high quality balsamic, which I think may make a difference.  I noticed some of the reviews complained of it tasting too vinegary and I suspect the quality of the balsamic may make the difference.

Excellent dish, what we like to call classic California cuisine!  I made only a couple of changes to the original recipe; added in black olives (sliced in half) and artichoke hearts with the chicken while it soaked up all that balsamic-vingary yumminess.  I also added a splash of white wine, just cause I love it.  Enjoy!

Seriously yummy!  Halved the amount of chicken the recipe calls for since it's just the two of us and a three year old.  We used about a half pound of mushrooms, which was quite a lot for the amount of chicken, but since we love mushrooms that was okay.  :D  We also made the whole amount of sauce the recipe calls for and only had a little left over that we'll just use w/other chicken leftovers from another night.  Omitted the butter; try not to add fat where we don't think it's needed.  Did take out a bit of the sauce, added some cornstarch to it, then added it back to the rest of the sauce to thicken it a little.  Served w/baked potatoes and broccoli - great meal!  Thanks for the recipe!!

This was good, but all I could taste was the balsamic vinegar and thought it needed more flavor. But the presentation was beautiful, and added a sweet spice as some other reviewers suggested. It really balanced out the flavor!

This was good.  I did like the other reviewers and omitted the flour.  I chopped up the chicken, added miscellaneous veggies and served it over rice.  And instead of balsamic vinegar, I used raspberry balsamic vinegar and mixed in some brown sugar to cut the acidic flavor.  We will do this again!

Made just as written but used jarred mushrooms.  Fantastic flavor!  Husband really enjoyed, said I could make it for him anytime!  I think the balsamic reduction & mushrooms would be great with pork, beef, you name it!  Thanks for the post!

This is a great recipe! The only changes I made was to add a little over a cup of stock, and did not dredge the chicken in flour, instead I just added a little corn starch slurry after I removed the chicken, and after the sauce had thickened I stirred in 1 tablespoon of sour cream poured over the chicken and enjoyed! Thanks for a great recipe!

Awesome!  This was such a delicious dish!  Per other reviewers, I skipped the flour and added more garlic (used 8 cloves), but everything else stayed the same.  I used crimini mushrooms and they were so yummy!  The sauce has spectacular flavor!  This is going into our top chicken recipes for sure!  Thank you!

I followed previous reviews and excluded the flour. Other than that, followed the recipe exactly and after making it twice, have added it to my "will make often" list. VERY good.

Love this recipe!!  It's elegant and easy! I did what others suggested and did not flour the chicken breasts.  I also did not add butter, trying to cut the fat, and it was still super yummy!  I did use some cornstarch to thicken the sauce and I used at least double the amount of chicken broth and it was perfect!    I served it with Gnocchis from trader joes, salad and artichokes. The whole family loved it!

Absolutely delicious! Was skeptical because it just seemed way too easy...but it was great.  Kept the vinegar & increased chicken broth.  Used a little corn starch at end to thicken sauce.  Served w/mashed potatoes.  Next time will serve over pasta. Thanks!

This was just ok. The chicken turned out juicy and tender. We omitted the mushrooms and served over egg noodles. The sauce was just ok. I doubt we'll make this again.

This was absolutely DELICIOUS! Everyone loved it.   The only changes I made:  More garlic A bit more chicken stock and vinegar towards the end (with a bit more flour to thicken it a bit) Fresh basil instead of bay leaf  I did pound out my chicken, I did dredge it in flour....I served it over egg noodles. This was so easy and so delicious...thank you for this recipe, I'm so glad to have it to pull out on days when I feel like eating something easy to prepare which also tastes DELICIOUS. Just...a tasty flavor...very good!

AMAZING!!! The best dinner recipe I have gotten from this site yet. I didn't dredge it in flour and it turned out fantastic. I never removed the chicken from the pan either since it didnt have the flour on it. Will most definitely make again!

So made this for the family and everyone really didn't like it. I'm pretty sure it was the balsamic vinegar...I guess you have to like it. But I have to say that my boyfriend and I love this balsamic vinegar marinated artichoke at a restaurant we go to, I figured balsamic vinegar could work with everything which is why I tried this recipe but I guess not.

This recipe was great! My family loved it. But since my boyfriend hates mushrooms, I substituted with onion instead. The carmelized rings looked so pretty and tasted delicious with the sauce. I also sprinkled a bit of dried basil because I unexpectedly ran out of thyme.

Fabulous!  I did omit the flour as other reviews suggested and flattened the breasts so they would cook evenly, but otherwise followed exactly and it turned out delicious!  Hubby said definitely add it to the rotation.

Made exactly as stated except I didn't use flour on the chicken. I wasn't impressed. Too much vinegar for me, and I don't like thyme so I will just substitute something else for it next time. Sauce is quite runny so maybe a bit of flour will make it thicker (since i omitted the flour on the chicken per previous reviews). Also, are you supposed to mince the garlic or just stick the whole clove in there? Eating a clove of garlic is not very appetizing, so next time, I'll mince it--provided that there'll be a next time.

Very good!  I fileted the chicken breasts and sauteed them for 5 minutes per side.  Next time I will use half olive oil and half butter for sauteeing.  I will also cook both sides of the chicken and then remove them and keep them warm while sauteeing the mushrooms, as they prevented the second side of the chicken from browning adequately.  I will return the chicken to the pan when adding the liquids.  The amount of vinegar was perfect!  I will continue to dredge the chicken in flour before cooking, as I feel that it adds that succulent texture that I'm looking for in this dish.

This was very good.  I definitely added more chix broth to make sauce the but the sauce was amazingly flavorful.  I am going to try again and omit the flour next time and the butter at the end, not necessary.  I wasn't sure whether to chop or mince or neither with the garlic. I chopped a bunch of it and it was awesome.  I would also remove the chicken (keeping warm) before I put in the garlic and mushrooms and make a sauce on a lower heat.

This recipe is soo tasty!!  I used Light Balsamic Vinagrette dressing as a substitute because I was too lazy to go to the market and I had all the other ingredients here.  LOL

Good. Easy. I didn't put mushrooms in because we don't like them and it was still very tasty. I also didn't flour chicken but pounded it out a bit. Thew the whole bit over pasta and loved it.

This was very good.  The only variation I made: I also didn't dredge the chicken in flour, instead I added a TBS of flour to 1/4 cup of water, shook it up and then added that to the gravy and it thickened up perfectly.  Also, I marinated the chicken for about 1/2 hour in Balsamic Vinegar.  Came out great and I will make this again.

Yummy.  The only thing I changed in this recipe was that I used Wondra instead of flour on the chicken.  Like this, the chicken was very good and not soggy.  I also pounded the chicken very thin.  The balsamic flavors were very good with the portabella mushrooms.  I will definitely make again.

I didn't expect to like this one as much I did!  We didn't have any mushrooms, so I just added onions, but followed exactly otherwise.  Thanks!

I wanted to like this, but I really didn't! I thought the sauce had minimal flavor, and I did like the balsamic in it, but the chicken was tasteless to me. I won't make this one again.

I actually didn't like this recipie.  I'm probably the only one.  I found it to have very little flavor and was greatly dissapointed as I love garlic and balsamic vinegar.  I even added more garlic than required.

Amazing! I am a vegetarian so I made this recipe using portebello mushrooms (I treated them as if they were chicken). They sauce is sweet and savory, and not over powering. My husband ate the chicken version and loved it. He told me that this one is a keeper.

This recipe was to die for! It was so tender, moist and flavorful. So easy to make too.

The only things I did different was that I didn't use fresh mushrooms because I didn't have any. Instead, I used some wild forest mushrooms from a jar. I also didn't have thyme so I used a mixture of a few other herbs.

Chicken came out very flavorful and super tender. I used a meat mallet to thin out the thicker part of the breasts. Didn't do the flour coating. Used a high quality balsamic vinegar so I didn't have a problem with too strong of a vinegar taste when using all 1/4 C. Will definitely make again. Served over rice which soaked up the extra sauce.

This was fantastic!!! I am very picky...and find myself disappointed with many recipes on this site that people rate 5 stars.  This one is worthy of all 5 stars and then some!! Restaurant quality for sure! I did modify just a bit.  I increased the vinegar and broth for extra sauce and added about 1/8 c white wine for flavor. My husband hates when he can taste wine in food and he loved this dish (so it was just enough).  That is saying alot when he rarely comments on anything he eats unless he doesn't like it.  The other modification I made was adding 1 can of italian seasoned tomatoes (another reviewer recommended it) and about 1/4 c half and half and 1/8 c parmasan cheese.  I served it over whole wheat linguini. Yum Yum Yum!

I have just used this as a way of cooking chicken (sometimes with veggies like zucchini & broccoli) and NOT breading the chicken.  It's good! I like to cook it to a nice thick sauce.

If you love garlic you will love this recipe. It was fantastic according to my garlic loving family. This is a simple dish that tastes and looks as though a great deal of time was spent in the kitchen.  The only changes I made included using precooked, italian seasoned breasts which I dredged in breadcrumbs instead of flour. I then gave them a quick sautee.  I also doubled the sauce to have enough to pour over linguine.  This is a perfect dish for an inpromptu dinner party or for unexpected guests.

I made this last night and it was really good.  My family isn't really into things with a sweet taste but it was all eaten regardless. I did make extra sauce like others suggested and used that as a gravy.

This was good - next time I think I'll pound the chicken breast to make the cooking time faster, as my breasts were pretty big.  The only thing I did differently was use cornstarch to thicken the sauce, as I was hungry and got tired of waiting & I omitted the flour.  I served it with baked cauliflower with parmesan cheese for a low carb dinner.  Hubby thought it tasted just like marasala.  Will make again  thanks for the recipe!

This was just ok for us. I left out the mushrooms because neither my husband or I like them. Maybe that's why I felt like it was missing something. Also my garlic had a burnt flavor to it so maybe the heat was too high. If I make this again I will follow the advice of other raters and omit the flour and pound the chicken breasts.

This was good, but not spectacular.  Though my husband liked it. I think it verged on being really good but it is missing something.  I slightly increased the broth and vinegar and added 1-2 teaspoons of sugar to cut some of the vinegar as I suspected it would be a bit tart as is.  I also pounded the chicken becuase I like the tenderness of pounded chicken.  I omited the flour b/c no one said it worked here but used a lot of All Season on the plain chicken.

The cooking method is very similar to chicken marsala, where a seasoned flour dredging is then browned in butter.  I might try to do that next time.  I like the reduced vinegar and garlic flavor, but I have to agree with some others that it was a touch bland.  If you werent getting a mouthful of vinegar sauce the chicken was really mild tasting- almost boring.  I had to salt it up quite a bit after cooking.

There is a more savory similar dish that is Chicken Abdoo with soy sauce and vinegar which is worth looking at if you like this one.  But I am going to try next time to pound, dredge in seasoned salted flour, sautee in butter and maybe double the reduction sauce so you cant help but get it with each bite.  It was a little bit scarce after reducing this time.

I am going to try this again, but as written, Id say its a 3 star.  I think I would have been really unhappy with unpounded chicken as the flattened chicken was at least more exposed to the sauce during cooking.

The only thing I didn't like was that the breading got kind of mushy after cooking in the sauce. Next time I will probably omit the step of dredging in flour. I also omitted the extra butter to cut fat/calories. But, the flavor was still absolutely spectacular, and I will definitely make it again.

This was a fabulous dish!  I went light on the salt but followed the rest faithfully as I have never cooked with balsamic vinegar.  One of the easiest, quickest chicken recipes and my non-chicken eater rated it excellent!  It has already been passed and will be served often!

I found this recipe while searching for something similar we had at a local restaurant. The sauce is a perfect match. To duplicate the restaurant dish, I sauteed some sliced red onion with the mushrooms and added some sliced smoked sausage during the simmering. I doubled the sauce. Served over pearl pasta (acini de pepe)with sauteed spinach. Delicious! Thank you very much.

When I make this again I will pound out (tenderize) the chicken breast so they are thinner and absorb more of the juices.

The only thing I did differently was to completely take the mushrooms out of the equation since half my family does not like them. It turned out AMAZING! My husband has told all of his friends how good this was, and has requested it again often! Thank you for the recipe!

This recipe doesn't need another rave review but I only give 5 stars to amazing dishes.  Always make it the first time as written so I know what is supposed to taste like.  It was DELICIOUS but next time I'll add a touch less balsamic.  Was a bit tangy for my tastes but still great.  Served over egg noodles with a side dish of "sauteed garlic asparagus" from this site, which was also incredible.  One great meal !!

This stuff is sooo good. We use just two breasts with the same amount of sauce we like to have plenty and pour it over homemade mashed potatoes asparagas goes well too

It was very flavorful.  mostly the mushrooms is what saves it.  I might have overcooked it, chicken was dry.  But the sauce and mushrooms that absorb all the flavor still saved it that speaks volumes for the sauce. Don't overcook

Excellent recipe. I needed something fast and easy and this was all that and more. I did not bread the chicken breasts and I used canned mushrooms, but other than that I followed the recipe to the T. It was delicious and omitting the breading did not detract from this dish at all. As a matter of fact I can't see how it could possibly make it any better so I'll probably make it this was from now on. I served it with garlic mashed red potatoes and steamed asparagus. Wonderful meal. My picky teenage son even asked for seconds!

4 1/2 stars. I doubled the sauce and mushrooms and added some sliced onion. I also used a couple tablespoons of my  spicy balsamic vinegar in the measurement for some added kick. I added the flour at the end to thicken the sauce up. Because I was short on time I served it with whole wheat cous cous cooked in chx broth. It was really good that way! I also forgot to add in the butter at the end and I don't think it was needed, I will omit it for future cookings. Definitely a keeper :)

This recipe was a huge hit with the family.  I made a double batch and hardly had any left.  I had to cook it in two batches but it was excellent.  We were a little liberal with the garlic and tossed in a few extra cloves.  We also did the same with the mushrooms.  Our whole family loves Balsamic Vinegar so we kept the amount as listed.

This was a GREAT recipe!!! I made this for dinner tonight and my husband, 16-year old picky nephew, and I LOVED IT!  I didn't make too many variations.  After reading the other reviews, I just totally skipped the step of flouring the chicken.  I just sauteed it with just the seasoning.  I added flour at the end to thicken the mushroom sauce ... worked great!  Also, I used chicken stock instead of chicken broth - stock is just a preference of mine.  Lastly, I added onion only because my family loves the taste of onion whenever garlic is in a recipe.  Other than that, this was perfect!!!!  Thanks for posting!

AWESOME!!  This recipes was wonderful. I used to make a similar recipe with red wine, but now we will probably always use Balsamic Vinegar.  The taste was really aswesome!  I used more chicken broth and then put some cornstarch in at the end to thicken the sauce up a little bit and it was wonderful over the chicken and white rice.  We can't wait to have it again!

This was pretty tasty - I served with carrots and shell pasta. Next time, I'll make more sauce to have over the pasta and the chicken. I also used onions instead of mushrooms (we don't like them).

I loved this and will make it again. It looks and tastes like gourmet. I served it with white rice. Just a couple of pointers: 1) this calls for 4 chicken breasts, and I think it means half breasts, not whole ones. 2)NEVER rinse mushrooms; just wipe them with a paper towel or a little brush -- they're like sponges and will bloat up and release the water during cooking. Maybe that's why some people complained about slimy chicken breasts?

My husband loved this recipe. It was easy to make and the chicken turned out moist and with a good flavored sauce. I'd recommend soaking chicken first in the sauce as some other reviews have suggested.  I'll definitely make this again and maybe try with portabello mushrooms.

Fantastic!! I had chicken thawing and dreaded the thought of another dried-out chicken breast on the panini press. Just minutes before I headed to the kitchen, I found this recipe and decided to try it. I didn't have fresh mushrooms, so I used a red onion, as another reviewer suggested. I didn't have a bay leaf, so I used fresh rosemary. I followed the other directions to the letter, and the dish was amazing!! I have never made decent gravy, but this sauce thickened beautifully and was so tasty. My husband is the cook in the family and he couldn't stop raving about the "special dinner" I had created. I can't wait to try it next time with the mushrooms. What a great recipe!

this is one of the best chicken recipes i have ever tasted!  i only changed one thing.  i did not have mushrooms so i used half of a red onion in large slices.  i don't think i will ever make it with mushrooms because the red onion added such an amazing flavor! and it was very easy too!

Mmmmm, this sauce is soooo good!  I made a pork tenderloin (guy's fave for his birthday) and used this sauce with it. Also, when I made it with chicken, I pounded the chicken breasts and I did dredge them.  I know some people mentioned that there was no point to the flour but I think it really helped keep the chicken moist.  Nothing worse than dry chicken. Also added cornstarch=water cause we like sauces a little thicker.
Update... made the sauce again but didn't have enough mushrooms so I sauteed some fresh green beans with the garlic and mushrooms and it came out absolutely amazing.  Husband couldn't stop talking about it.

I made this recipe more for my wife than myself as she digs the balsamic vinegar/garlic combo and I prefer Mexican-style chicken. It came out pretty good, and although I don't care much for mushrooms I enjoyed it. Needless to say, my wife really liked it. The best part for me, though, was the smell while it was cooking - a really nice rich smell filled the kitchen while the chicken and mushrooms and vinegar cooked together. Will make this again.

Excellent! Chicken comes out moist. I have made this several times and it is always a hit! I did not add the bay leaf or thyme. I made this in an electric skillet. Watch when you cover and let it simmer the it does not add to much condensation/water, which will cause your flour batter to get to moist and fall off. It is fast, easy and tastes great!

Ooooh yum.  This was delicious!!!!!  I wasn't sure what I was supposed to do with the garlic so I minced it.  I didn't have chicken broth (which I realized half way through cooking) so I used beef broth and it was still wonderful.  Even my kids oooh-ed and aaaah-ed (of course, I served theirs without the mushrooms LOL). Will DEFINITELY make this again!!

This was really good!  In cooking for two, I used 2 chicken breasts and made the same amount of sauce.  I used 7/8 C chicken broth instead of 3/4 and 1/8 C balsamic vinegar instead of 1/4.  Also used a 3oz can of mushrooms only because we were out of fresh.  Served this over a bed of plain white rice and the amt of sauce was perfect.  Easy and Tasty...my favorite combination!

So good!  This tasted like marsala, but with a twist.  I've made this several times and i always double the sauce and mushrooms.  Oddly enough, it pairs great with sweet potato fries that you bake in the oven.  The garlic is important becuase it balances the flavor (i tried it without and it didn't taste right).

Oh my goodness, is the least my husband and I can say about this recipe.  It was so delicious.  I told hubby, this is the kind of recipe that would keep me coming back to a restaurant!  I did read other's reviews and took the advice of doubling the liquids...GREAT IDEA!! I used fresh thyme sprigs and gave the fresh garlic a crush with the side of my knife and coarsely chopped it also.  I will be making this recipe for family and guests also.

We really liked this. I used a pound of mushrooms and only 4 cloves of garlic. I also made a vegetarian version using fake chicken and vegetable stock. The only thing I would do differently next time is to make more sauce as it reduced down quite a bit while simmering. I would definitely serve this to guests. Thankyou.

I was very disapointed in this dish.  I love balsamic vinegar and it was still too much for me in this dish.  Even after making the changes suggested by other reviewers, add more mushroom, onion, less vinegar, no flour, I found that the taste of balsamic vinegar overwhelmed the whole dish. I could hardly even taste the garlic (and I used 8 cloves).  It was good enough that we did eat it, but will definately not be making agian

This dish was easy to make and delicious.  It did need more sauce and had to add more broth.  Then thickened it with corn starch.  Served it over rice.

I love this chicken, it's one of my favorite recipes on this site. I love the vinegar flavor so I wouldn't change a thing. 
I usually double balsamic vinegar, chicken broth and seasonings to make lots of sauce I also add in 1/2 teaspoon of Italian seasoning and pound my chicken down to a 1/4" thick. It makes excellent Sandwiches on Italian bread with fresh mozzarella. I give this recipe 10 STARS.

How strange I'm reviewing this exactly one year after adding it to my recipe box! This chicken was lovely, I used a little less garlic (4 cloves) and added some finely chopped shallot to it when frying the garlic. I also used baby portabella mushrooms which were gorgeous. Also added a splash of white wine to the sauce. Served with green beans and wild rice this was a superb dish for company and was also easy to achieve! Thank you for the recipe!

It had a very mild flavor..not strong at all. I took other advice and added cream at the end and maybe it diluted the flavor. I might try it again without the cream. My husband liked it. I chopped the chicken into 7/8 pieces per breast before cooking and they were very tender when it was done. I served it with mashed potatoes which my husband loved with the sauce.

Very good.  I made it without mushrooms and quartered the cloves.  Be careful not to over reduce at the end.  My sauce was tasty, but it was too thick and there wasn't enough of it.

Overall this was a good recipe.  I made a few personal preference changes.  I always, always pound chicken breast, it makes for a much more delicate texture and cooks more evenly.  I took the chicken out of the pan while the mushrooms were going and then added back when the vinegar and broth went in.  Chicken breast doesn't take that long to cook.  The simmering time was less than 10 minutes.  For the garlic, I only had 3 (but they were large) cloves.  Recipe didn't state whether to chop, mince, leave whole, so I just ran a knife through them a few times.  The end result was very good.  I will be making this again.

Delicious and easy. Made only 1 change--didn't have fresh mushrooms and used 2 4oz cans instead. My garlic were big because we like the taste and the balsamic vinegar was wonderful.  However, I would not recommend serving if you're not sure whether or not someone might like the taste of balsamic vinegar.

Good and quick. I didn't add any flour or corn syrup at the end, but instead added 1 teaspoon of sugar to slightly thicken and caramelize the sauce. The only complaint my boyfriend had was that there wasn't enough sauce!

This is fantastic. The whole family loved it. The chicken was really tender. Enjoyed it so much that I made copies of the recipe and handed them out at work the next day. Added a little extra balsamic vinegar and used a whole pound of mushrooms.

An excellent recipe--the whole family gave it 5 stars -- I did cut the chicken up into bite size pieces before cooking to get better coverage on browning and more area for the sauce to cover -- but other than that a very flavorful easy recipe--Thanks!

I made this last night and we were disappointed.  For one thing, the recipe didn't indicate whether to chop the garlic cloves, so I assumed they were not to be chopped.  There was very little garlic flavor.  My husband didn't like this at all - he said it had a flavor he could do without and not to make it again.  I never cook very much with thyme, and this may have the flavor he didn't like.

I thought it was very good, but I would do things a bit differently next time.  I would pound out the chicken breasts before dredging them, as the thicker parts were very dry.  I added 1 can of chicken broth instead if the 3/4 cup, and kept the rest the same.  Very good flavor.  Lots of leftover sauce for rice or potato's. My kids get nervous around mushrooms, so I gave them the chicken with out them, and they ate it!

WOW! This was AMAZING! Presentation is elegant! I used 1 can of mushrooms (drained) in place of fresh because it's what I had on hand. The breasts were rather thick (I could have pounded thin but didn't want to take the time) so they required a little longer cooking time, about 6 minutes per side and then 20 minutes simmering. We just LOVED this dish! Not too much garlic at all - the balsamic vinegar balanced the garlic nicely. I did use a tad more thyme than what it called for. SUPER! This one will go in with my favorites! Thanks for the post Colleen! Excellent!

This recipe is amazing!!!  I did thicken the sauce a little with about  1/2 T. cornstarch and 3 T. chicken broth so it was a little more like gravy.  My husband raved and raved and he is such a picky eater that I hate trying new recipes.  He told me this was a definite keeper!! :)

Great recipe! As others suggested, I omitted the flour and thickened the sauce at the end with corn starch. I also like onions & mushrooms, so they were added to the mix. This is not for someone who prefers "bland".

I didn't have mushrooms on hand but I went ahead and made it anyway, without using the flour for the chicken.  I reduced the amount of the vinegar to about 2 TB.  It still turned out delicious and the whole family snarfed it down.

This was a nice recipe but I found the vinegar flavour a little overpowering (even though I love vinegar!). Next time will reduce the vinegar a little and use no butter - the sauce thickened nicely so I don't think it needs it.

I also thought that the amount of vinegar could have been cut in half...it was too overpowering.  But overall, a great dish...I made garlic red potatoes on the side...there were no leftovers!

Very vinegary, which resembled a Filipino dish, adobo. I added more garlic powder and thyme, but the balsamic vinegar overpowered it. I'm not sure if I will make it again. If I do, I'd half the amount of vinegar and double the garlic.

very good.  followed others' advice to not use flour and cut back on the balsamic vinegar a little.  added another 1/2 cup of broth too.  definitely a keeper!

The recipe is easy to follow and the meal came out well. The mushrooms are amazing in the sauce! They were definitely the stars of the dish.

I sautéed the chicken using the flour and spices and then put them aside. I made the balsamic vinegar sauce in the pan with the flour bits and scraped it up. Once cooked down a few minutes I poured the sauce over the chicken and served. That eliminates the flour from getting gooey on the chicken.

According to most of the reviews I didn’t dredge in flour, instead seasoned with my modge podge of Italian seasonings, used less balsamic vinegar and LOVED the outcome! Saving this recipe to make again & again!

I already rated this as awesome, but forgot to mention that I also flattened the chicken breasts, so they didn't need quite as long to cook through.

Delicious! This is the first meal I have made in 3 years and I found it was very easy to prepare. The mushrooms are a bit bitter due to the balsamic vinegar but when paired with the  chicken the flavor becomes great!

I followed the recipe exactly but both my husband and I found this bland. If I was to make it again, I would use more balsamic vinegar and garlic. However, I will probably just find another recipe.

Really good, but would make a few changes. Half the balsamic, flour was an unnecessary step (doesn't take away but doesn't add either), and I wouldn't serve with pasta as presented in the photo. I think mashed potatoes or rice would be a better option.

Made this two days ago and it has became one of my favourite chicken recipe. Was skeptical about using 1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar as I'm not used to the flavour but I'm glad I did. The flavour wasn't overpowering. There was just a slight tangy taste which made it really tasty!! Also, thanks to the comments that some pounded the chicken so that the middle will be cooked. I cut and opened the chicken like a book. So so yummy!! Will definitely make it again tomorrow.

Nothing special about the chicken itself, but I could drink a glass of that sauce! Great over orzo pasta. I'll make this one again. Tasted great and came together faster than the pasta cook time.

This was easy and yummy. I only used three chicken breasts (granted, they were fairly large), and I felt like the amount of sauce would be skimpy for four. Very tasty.

Made this pretty much according to the recipe except I added about 3X the thyme.  It was wonderful.  The only thing I might do next time is increase the amount of sauce.  We all loved it.

This became one of our "go to" meals after first discovering it several years ago. I often serve it to company and everybody loves it! 
Anyone who would suggest "enhancing" the flavour by adding sugar should stick to sauces aimed at simpler palates, such as McNugget dips.

Made it exactly as written but adjusted amounts for 2 servings.  My husband loved it (as did I).  We had it with leftover rice, green beans, sweet potato and a salad.  Perfect meal that took very little time to prepare.  Thank you for this recipe.

This was wonderful! I always prefer to follow recipe as written if I plan to rate it. The only thing I did differently was to use 3/4 t. garlic powder in place of fresh garlic..tragic I know, but I didn't realize I was out of garlic until I'd already started prepping the meal. I also didn't have thyme so I substituted with Italian seasoning.  This was still a fantastic dish and will most definitely be made again!! Next time with fresh garlic and extra sauce!

I did not care for this recipe and neither did my husband.. I only added 1/8 th of the balsamic vimegar and the chicken was so tart I did not enjoy it at all. I left most of it.
very unusual for both of us to leave food behind... Maybe it is simply a matter of taste, but I will not be making this again.

So, I hhhhhhate mushrooms... Instead, I added multi-peppers (Red, Yellow & Green). I also ended up using 6 chicken breasts w/ribbed meat. Kept everything the same, expect I used Sea Salt, diced garlic & about 1/8 Balsamic. It turned out really well. After taking the breasts out, I let the sauce simmer a couple minutes longer & I served on top of Brown rice, scooping the juice/peppers over both. Had a Mixed Green salad on the side & I am happy-full. Thanks for recipe! Oh, I attached pics..yup, I ate it on a paper plate (didn't affect taste..lol)

This was by far the best recipe ive Ade from this site, which, by the way I love!!!! Anyway, I have little ones, so I used cream of chicken soup on place of the chicken stalk to lighten the balsamic up a bit. Must try! Really did taste like something I had ordered at a restraunt! Everyone else loved it too! This recipe is a keeper in my household!

This was really tasty. I really like balsamic vinegar, but my boyfriend does not and he still thought it was delish. We added cream at the end and I think it really made the dish. We will for sure make this again!

Amazing flavor and pretty easy to prepare.  Definitely company-worthy.
I omitted the flouring and added chopped tomatoes and broccoli which took on the flavors beautifully.  Also put in about a tablespoon of cream to make sure the vinegar wasn't overpowering.  No worries there!
It tasted even better after freezing it and thawing.

This is a great recipe and one that I've made several times.  I cut the chicken down into thinner equal pieces to cook evenly (and I don't like thick meaty chicken).  I also followed the advice of others and did not bread the chicken.  

I added more mushrooms (a variety), I omitted the bay leaf (b/c I didn't have it), and used fresh thyme.  

Delicious!  

I served it with basmati rice and a side salad.  

My 3 kids (ages 7, 5, and 2) loved it plus my husband. Makes great left overs too.

heres the deal----the chicken definitely needs some tweaking or it just turns into a bland piece of poultry (i would strongly suggest cutting the breast into bite sized pieces). however, the sauce was absolutely perfect in terms of flavor and so i decided to give this recipe 4 instead of 3 stars which it would have deserved otherwise.

Fan. Tas. Tic. I've cooked this twice now, the second time adding more garlic (we love garlic...) and doubling the quantity of thyme. It's a superb recipe and everyone who has tried it cleaned their plates. Don't understand those who have complained of bitterness; I can only guess they used cheap, non-Modena balsamic, or something else entirely.

This was awesome, easy, complex! And it was something you would go to a 5 Star restaurant and order again and again!  I'm glad I have leftovers!
My "meat and potatoes" husband REALLY liked it.  I made it just as the recipe prescribed and it was delicious!    This is my first review I've ever offered just because this recipe was sooo good!

Wonderful recipe.  I added onions and used benecol instead of butter.  I also removed the chicken while sautéing the mushrooms and onions and then added it back to the sauce and simmered it, covered, for half an hour.

I feel as though the dredging is unnecessary as the real star here is the mushroom sauce. A simple chicken breast would do!

I loved this recipe.  I skipped the butter at the end and added another cup of broth before cooking it down.  I also skipped the bay leaf.  It was very good.  Be sure to use good balsamic for well balanced flavor.

I really liked this, but my husband said 3 or 4 stars.  I followed the recipe, except I used chicken tenders. I tasted the sauce with every bite.   I had to add a bit of water to the sauce at the end because there wasn't a lot of it. It turned out great.   My young kids gave it 3 stars, which is high for them!

I followed the recipe except for not adding the flour (added cornstarch at the end to thicken the sauce) and adding more garlic as per other reviews.  I found the sauce was a bit too vinegary for our taste. I had to add cream to tone down the vinegary flavour.  My husband was not a big fan...but then again, he's not partial to sour flavours.  To each their own :)

This was a great recipe! I didn't have any balsamic vinegar, so I used balsamic vinaigrette instead and it still tasted awesome! I didn't use any four on the chicken either. I just added a little corn starch as another reviewer suggested to thicken up the sauce and it worked great!

This dish was delish!  Super easy and simple to make. I had all the ingredients on hand but the mushrooms.  So I made it with out and it was still great! I used my cast iron braiser and it cooked perfect.  I love vinegar so I make it with a 1/2 cup and a whole can of broth.  I also added a tablespoon of honey to help with the tang. Served with roasted rosemary potatoes and broccoli, it was the perfect weeknight meal. Some people leave out the flour, but that helps thicken the sauce while it's reducing.

Terrific! I also skipped the four step and thickened sauce near the end with about 1 1/2 tsp of corn starch.  I served it over thin spaghetti with a side of roasted baby potatoes and carrots. I was very impressed with the outcome and highly recommend everyone try it!

I thought this was fantastic!  Very quick and easy and I loved the flavor!  I only had 2 breasts but did not halve the sauce portion of the recipe and found it was the perfect amount to compliment the chicken.

My family absolutely loved it.  I was worried about the taste because it is balsamic vinegar, but I was very surprised.  I wasn't quite sure my daughter who is 10 would love it, but, she loved it and was asking that I make it again next week.  Yummy!!

Thought I made it per the recipe but discovered that I forgot the butter at the end.  I only cooked one chicken breast and it fed my husband and myself with a small portion left over.  Had a wonderful flavor and so easy to make.   I am not a white meat person because of potential dryness but this was so moist.   Will definately do this again.

My family absolutely loved this dinner- rated it a 10! I used pre sliced portobello mushrooms and it was yummy EXCEPT I think they made the sauce too liquidy. It was very tasty just watery. Will DEFINITELY make this again!

This has been in my recipe book for a few years now. It's a favorite. Use a really good quality balsamic vinegar and it's even better.

Excellent!  I pounded the chicken breasts and cut them in half.  Put the flour, salt and pepper in a Ziploc, added the chicken and shook them up.  Easier than dredging each piece.  Didn't have balsamic vinegar so I substituted Newman's balsamic dressing.  Will definitely be making this again!

Take others' suggestions and don't flour the chicken. Because it sits in  the liquid for so long it gets slimy.

I made this recipe for Christmas Eve - served it with a basic risotto and green beans and it was great. I scaled it up in size to feed 6 and no problem. I pre-pound my boneless skinless chicken breasts when I bring them home and freeze individually for quick thaw and quick cooking. I used these which makes for nice even cooking time but that was my only "change" to the recipe. Made as directed and it turned out beautifully - so yummy and everyone enjoyed it. Some people might think that the flavour will be strong with so much basalmic but it is lovely. Enjoy and thank you for the submission. Always love to try new chicken recipes on my family.

I really liked this. Tiny question on it...do the garlic cloves go in whole rather than chopped or minced? Hmmm... I did them whole. Looked and smelled wonderful. On the chicken it was so-so. The mushrooms were where it's at. Yummm!!!  As other reviewers I omitted the flour step. I'll make this again and experiment with the garlic to give it more flavor.

So bland and I added entire onion, cayenne pepper and goat cheese...one star because after adding soy sauce to my plate it was somewhat palatable.

I just made this and I am eating it right now. It is delicious. I will have to do this dish again.  I ate this with spaghetti but I could do this with rice too.  Like most of the reviewers, I am a little intimidated by balsamic vinegar.  Now that I have crossed that hurdle, I'll have to try other recipes using balsamic vinegar

Delish! I was going to make Chicken Marsala tonight but realized I had no Marsala. So I searched and found this and it's a winner!! To Erin who gave it 2 stars, the bitterness would have been from the vinegar. I used a good quality white balsamic and my hubby and son even ate the mushrooms, which is rare. I will make this again for sure!

Love how simple and easy this recipe is and the end product is good!  The chicken is very tasty and tender, I made a little more sauce so that it will be enough for my pasta.  I mix 2/3 of the sauce with my pasta the rest I put over my chicken when I served it, so that the chicken is not too dry.

Loved this recipe, it was easy to cook and oh sooooo yummy! I, like the others omitted the flour. I also added a large onion roughly sliced to the mix. Then in order to thicken it up I added some cornstarch and poured it over the chicken on a bed of rice.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe! My sister and I made this (a very large portion) for mothers day to feed my mother's family of 5, my sisters family of 3 and my family of 3. Everyone LOVED it! We did make two different sauces. My sister had forgotten to add chicken broth to hers and it actually turned out better than mine (I added everything the recipe called for)  I no longer follow the directions when making it, I just guess and check (as I do with most things). I'd definitely suggest this recipe!

It was good but I wasn't crazy about it. I didn't flour the chicken as others suggested and added 4 garlic cloves instead of the 6. The sauce was very tangy because of the vinager, and I couldn't taste any garlic. If I make it again, I would add extra garlic cloves (8).

Wow!  Fantastic.  I too pounded the chicken breasts and did not use flour.   Because I didn't I had to thicken the sauce with a little cornstarch.  The rest of the recipe was made as shown. Don't worry if the mushrooms don't seem cooked enough after the 1st 3 minutes.  It turns out.  Believe me, even my picky teens and husband really liked this.

This was an impressive Valentine's Dinner but was so easy we'll be making this again weekly.  My three year old loved it too.  We halved the chicken but kept everything else the same and there was just enough sauce.  It was so good we wanted more.  If halving this recipe, don't skimp on the sauce.  The mushrooms were insanely tasty.

Wonderful!  Moist.  Flavorful.  Tender.  

I didn't have any mushrooms and our 2 half chicken breasts were 1-pound each.  I made this recipe without any modifications.  Husband said it was so good that he 'licked his plate clean'.  That's a lot for an Englishman!

One of the best recipes on this website, and is staple on my menu!  An easy dish, which looks and tastes gourmet. Would recommend for company or entertaining.. I also use white balsamic vinegar, which has been a nice addition.

This is spectacular. Followed suggestions and didn't use the flour, doubled the gravy with half uf the vinegar. Thickened it with 1T cornstarch. We were licking the plates.

We liked this, but it wasn't as phenomenal I was hoping it would be. I didn't dredge the chicken in flour and used portabello mushrooms. I served it over whole wheat couscous. It was easy and good :)

A quick and delicious dinner.  I loved the pan sauce!  Omitted mushrooms (because we don't like them), and cut the garlic down to 4 cloves - minced.  Pounded the chicken to be thinner per other reviews, and everything cooked and tasted wonderfully.  Served over some noodles.  YUM! Can't wait to make again :)

VERY good but I think I will take other advice and skip the flour next time.

Reduce balsamic by half or
add total of 2c of chicken broth 

Do not increased bay leaf

reduce thyme just under 1/4 tsp
Add half and half and sourcream if too tart

My parents loved it. They wished there was more sauce on the chicken though, so the next time I make this, I'll be adding more mushroom and balsamic vinegar.

Excellent!  Super easy to make and delicious as it was appealing to the eye.  Followed recipe exactly as stated but next time may attempt adding a little corn starch to thicken the sauce.  Then again, I found the thinner sauce elegant as well.  You can't go wrong either way...thank you for sharing.  :)

This was easy and delicious!  I used 1 shallot and 4 cloves of garlic.  I also did not dredge the chicken in flour, but instead whisked some flour in toward the end (like gravy).  I also added Epicure's Pasta Seasoning (although it's perfectly tasty without it); it just added even more flavour.
And it's much yummier on potatoes than pasta (because the potatoes soak up that yummy sauce better).  And, I added a little more butter (3 tbsp) and more chicken broth (1.25 cups) than called for just to make more sauce.  This sounds like a lot of altering, but it's just tweaks to my taste.  The recipe really is very tasty on it's own!

The balsamic reduction is to die for! Next time, I plan to make more since we ran out and my family and I wanted to have it with the noodles as a sauce of sorts as well! The chicken was a bit overcooked, but I blame that on the electric stove I had to work with. Overall, excellent recipe and I'll definitely be making it again!

this made an awesome sauce..next time will do bigger batch of mushrooms though since we all loved how the mushrooms picked up so much of the broth flavor. I might think about merinading my chicken over night though to get more flavor into it. I thought since I tenderized my chicken breasts so that it cooked evenly that it would also allow more uptake of the sauce but mine didnt. Loved the flavor though

If you like vinegar, you will love this.  The whole family enjoyed this one, we had it with pasta, and it was wonderful.  I cut the chicken into smaller pieces, and used 3 bay leaves (one of my favorite seasonings) and it turned out beautiful.  Thanks for this dish!

we are NOT mushroom people, but have a really nice bottle of balsamic that i wanted to find new uses for.  i went ahead with a mix of "gourmet" (that's what the pkg said) mushrooms and we loved it! hubby even said he'd eat it again.  super easy to make and very flavorful.  i also skipped the flower dredging and just browned the first side in EVOO.

The only things I would change would be to pound the chicken to get it to a uniform thickness.  I would also double the mushrooms/sauce, because it was SOOO good.  Will make again.  I didn't have a bay leaf or the thyme and it was still divine!

Made this for the first time today and it was absolutely delicioius. I stayed true to the recipe, since it was the first time making, but used fresh herbs because I had them, doubled the amount, and added a bit of rosemary. The reduction sauce is pure gold, I loved it. Thanks for sharing, will be making this again for sure. Oh, others didn't care for the flour dredge, but I liked it - gave the reduction something to sort of cling to. Just personal preference I guess. Yum.

Was very good, but the chicken was a bit bland and would like the sauce to be more of a creamy sauce.  We are big on hot and spicy foods, so this may be why it seems a little bland for us.  Otherwise, it came out well...loved the mushrooms.

This dish is so delicious and easy! After reading the other reviews, I omitted the flour and felt it was great without. I also used portabella mushrooms (2) that were sliced and added kalamata olives. I'd like to try adding artichokes next time just to see how that turns out.  we served it over linguini and with some Swiss chard and bread on the side. My husband who is purely a meat and potato guy loved it. I will definitely make this dish again

I really didn't like the taste of this dish and I was disappointed because it smelled great throughout the preparation.  I found that I was not fond of the crust after the dredging in flour and found it too oily for my liking - although I only made 3 chicken breasts instead of 4 so that could have been a contributing factor.  My husband liked it but all in all I won't be making this dish again.

I was missing a few things...particularly garlic and the bay leaf.  We enjoyed the flavors, even without those ingredients.  However, I only had 3 chicken breasts and the amount of sauce was just about perfect. I don't think it would be enough for 4 breasts, as the recipe was written.  Additionally, the sauce was quite runny - I would have preferred it a bit thicker (maybe a bit of cornstarch dissolved in broth).  Finally, the sauce was pretty vinegary.  This was fine over the chicken, but I really love sauces and would not have enjoyed it in excess (which I didn't have because the recipe did not make much) because of the vinegar.

Still, it was pretty simple to make (I did pound the chicken with a cast iron skillet like some other reviewers) and pretty tasty.  I would definitely make it again, but increase the amount of sauce just a bit.

This recipe is quite forgiving, and easily customized to suit your own tastes. I use at least a pound of mushrooms, and a full 15 oz. can of Swanson broth for the sauce, thickening it at the end with a little cornstarch. I like to serve this over a bed of thyme infused rice cooked in water and chicken broth. I've done the chicken with and without flour and had great results either way. The extra sauce I end up with mixes great into the rice!  I'm sure it would work with pasta or potatoes just as well. I also like steamed broccoli or asparagus as a veggie side. Delicious, simple, and even a little elegant. Great for a casual dinner with a couple of guests, or a weeknight family meal. Thanks for a great recipe!

Delicious!!  I made this last night and it was a huge hit, the flavors are awesome!  The only thing I would have done differently is maybe make it with rice instead of linguine because the sauce is very thin.  I think rice would soak it up and enhance the flavor a little better.  Other than that, I loved it, I will be making this again!

This chicken is awesome!  Even my children, who don't care much for mushrooms, lapped this up!  I followed the recipe as written and served it with green beans and roasted potatoes.  This is a perfect chicken for those who like sauce!!

Very good recipe!  Wish I had listened to previous reviewers and omitted flouring the chicken before cooking; it really isn't necessary.  Served over whole wheat spaghetti.  Good stuff!

the sauce didn't look the greatest initially, but it was yummy! my chicked came out a smidge overcooked :( Wish I would've added more mushrooms since I made it over linguini. Without pasta(or rice), I'd say the mushrooms were fine.

I rarely coock for my boyfriend for two reasons 1) anyone you ask will tell you his mom is an awesome cook, as in she can heat up water and it taste delicious, great coock and 2) because of his mother being such a great cook he's a picky eater.... but when I prepared this recipe for him he LOVED it.  I followed the instructions for the most part, I increased the amount of chicken broth to 1 1/4 cups, 3/4 of balsamic vinegar and 2 tbsp of butter just to have more sauce left at then end and it was perfect! I recommend it to anyone wherther you are a beginner or a experienced cook!

My son and I tried this for the first time tonight and we loved it.  I used suggestions from other reviewers and they worked well.  I didn't dredge the chicken in flour, using 1 Tbsp flour in the sauce to thicken it instead.  I also didn't have thyme so I left it out.  The only Balsamic I had was Raspberry Balsamic and it was WONDERFUL in this sauce.  I only used 2 chicken breasts and I pounded them flatter then served the chicken and sauce over linguini.  I would double the sauce ingredients for 4 breasts, to have enough.  Will make again and pass it on.

Nice change from othr chicken recipes. Seemed to lack something, though. I like thicker sauces so I used a little cornstrach in it.  I would fix this again but will probably doctor it.  I rarely change a recipe the first time I try it.  It is not a fair assessment other wise.  Wish others would try before changing.

Just made this dish the other night. I decided to dice up the mushrooms, they integrated into the sauce much better, helping to add to the thickness. My husband absolutely LOVED it. This is a keeper!

This was VERY good. However, next time I will double the sauce ingredients. I only had 3 chicken breasts but used exact amounts of everything else. If anything, I should have had too much sauce - but I didn't have near enough as I would have liked to have had. But the flavor of the sauce was AMAZING and the chicken was oh so tender! I served it with Vermont cheddar mac n' cheese - they made the perfect pair!

This is truly an simply amazing recipe. It is so fast and easy; and still delicious enough to serve to guests! I always remove the chicken from the pan and add some flour to the sauce, just to thicken it a bit. Serve it with some pasta and a chunk of bread to scoop up the juice, and it's a perfect meal!

This was a very good recipe.  Very elegant.    I followed the instructions exactly the first time and there wasn't enough sauce for us (we are sauce people).  The next time I doubled the vinegar and broth.  The flour didn't add much to the coloring so it is a take or leave it step.  I have served it with pasta and with rice.  It is good with either.  I did cook the rice with chicken stock and it was a nice compliment to the dish.  I didn't rinse the mushrooms as I have always been told not to put mushrooms underwater as they will soak in the water.  If they need it, I wipe them off with a damp paper towel.

This recipe is great and very easy! I followed the recipe to a T excluding the flour. Some of the reviews recommended using less balsamic vinegar. But, if you are a fan of balsamic vinegar, as I am, I did not find it overpowering. The only changes I would make are only out of personal preference. I would use more mushrooms. Next time I will try portabellas. I will, also, thicken the sauce with a little cornstarch. Other than that, it is a great restaurant quality recipe that I will make again and again!

This is a delicious recipe. Like many reviews, I would avoid breading the chicken, The breading on my chicken fell off after absorbing the sauce. I served my chicken with pasta as shown in the picture, but found out that it's hard to eat pasta with a big piece of chicken on top. Next time, I'll cut the chicken into smaller pieces before serving.

Very good! Easy to make. Like others, I skipped flouring the chicken and I usually double the sauce (except garlic), even when only making two chicken breasts. I add a little corn starch at the end thicken the sauce a bit.

We tried this tonight for dinner and it was delicious! The chicken was cooked perfectly! I will certainly be making this more often!

Easy dish, but not very interesting in terms of flavor - very one note.  The chicken was tender, though.  I didn't change the recipe, served with mashed potatoes and peas.  Also, I agree with a previous reviewer that covering with flour made the chicken a bit slimy.

This is the BEST chicken I've ever had.  I took the lid off and let the sauce reduce more.  My husband thought the sauce could be thicker in order to stick onto the chicken which I will try next time.  Other than that it was melt in your mouth delicious!  My thanks to whoever thought up this one :o)

Honestly I was a little disappointed... maybe less Vinegar next time... and the chicken was too dry... again can be altered... overall being generous with 4 stars.  Was a nice change!!  Maybe playing around or trying it a couple more times... has potential!!

I made this tonight for the first time.  What I loved is that I had all the ingredients easily available.  I will probably make this again.  I think I went a bit heavy on the balsamic vinegar, so next time I will ease up a bit.  I served it over pasta, but I think next time I will bake red potatoes instead.

An easy dish, even for the beginner cook like me. The recipe doesn't show which type of mushroom to use, but I used shitake mushrooms which turned out great.  My party was impressed! :)

So good & easy to make! The only thing I did differently was I added about a 1/2 cup of white wine. I served it over angel hair pasta.

In my opinion, this recipe was pretty good.  My husband and I didn't rave about it, but enjoyed it and will make it again.  The chicken had a very good texture, but it was the flavor that could have been better, maybe tone down the vinegar next time.

Very good.  Follow others advice and omit the flour.  I added spinach and peas right at the end to the sauce and they absorbed a lot of flavor.

Great flavor! I love the mushrooms but my fiance doesn't, and it's fine without it. I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't let the chicken simmer with the sauce because I didn't want it to get overcooked. I added it back in at the end and it was perfect. Do use thinly sliced chicken breasts, and don't skimp out on the garlic/spices. Quick and easy. Yum!

Excellent recipe!  My husband likes extra sauce, so I used 1/3 cup vinegar and 1 cup broth.  I was out of thyme and substituted with rosemary and it was delicous!

I loved this dish.  Having just become a member I am so pleased that the first review I make is a good one.  I love sauce so I just added 1 cup of chicken stock instead of 3/4 and thickened it a little with cornstarch.  Mmmmm.  I had it with asparagus and carrots/sprouts (family likes and dislikes) and rotini pasta.  Enjoy.

Delish! I served mine over top some garlic/olive oil couscous. I also made it w/o the mushrooms and the bay leaf. Im not a big fan of either. I recommend not flouring your chicken, it made mine a bit mushy.

This was a hit with the entire family.  The chicken was super moist and flavorful.  The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars was because I think the vinegar taste was a little strong.  I LOVE vinegar and I just think it could use a tad less.

This recipe is absolutely delicious!  I omitted flouring my chicken breasts, but included onions and diced tomatoes to my sauce.  I also replaced the thyme with some rosemary and basil...you can't ever go wrong with rosemary!  We paired this dish with some asparagus and wild rice and LOVED it!!!

Very good!  I followed the recipe exactly and we really enjoyed it.  I will now invest in some better quality balsamic (I'm just about out anyway!) and it may be even better next time if that's possible.  Served with quinoa and sugar snap peas!

The chicken comes out very moist and flavorful however the coating of flour gets very soggy and almost slimy. My son did not like it at all.

I prepared this as a last minute dinner and what a hit it was!  I did not have fresh mushrooms, so had to use canned ones.  I served it over Jasmine rice and not a morsel was left for leftovers.

Simple and delicious!  I made it as is, and it was great.  I will make a few changes next time, but not many. 1)  I will probably skip the flour on the chicken - it didn't really add much and, as noted by others, it did make it a little slimy. 2) I'll brown the chicken on both sides, remove it from the pan and deglaze with the broth/vinegar.  Then I'll add back the chicken and put in the mushrooms. 3)  Double the sauce and mushrooms.  I served the chicken with pasta, and there wasn't enough to drizzle over the pasta and chicken for all 4 servings.

SUPERB!!! I skipped the flour, as other reviewers did.   For reviewers who though the sauce was too watery... you didn't let it reduce enough!! It should be like a GLAZE! I let it reduce for about 10 minutes, and the result was a thick, balsamic-y glaze. I felt like there wasn't enough glaze at the end though. So, I just threw in the same amounts of balsamic, broth, butter and a bit of thyme as called for in the recipe along with 1 clove of garlic and voila- I had more delicious tasting sauce. This is a keeper!

Great will definitely make again. Skipped the flour as other reviewers did,  used garlic powder (thought I had some but didn't) instead of garlic cloves and used a bouillon cube instead of chicken broth (again, thought I had some but didn't). But nevertheless, came out great.

Loved this sauce!  I also did not flour the chicken breasts ahead of time, as others mentioned and then just added some flour before adding the liquids, and it worked well and was much easier.  The chicken was not particularly tender, so I might take others' suggestions of pounding it flatter first to better soak in the sauce, but still, it was absolutely delicious!!!

I made this tonight for my husband and me.  It was an excellent dish!  We will definitely be making this again and again.  I did add a few slices of onion to the sauce, as my husband and both like the flavor of onion.  I also took the advice of another reviewer and doubled the recipe for the sauce.  I also went with 1/8 cup balsamic vinegar, as someone else suggested, but in doubling it it came out to 1/4 cup..perfect tang!  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

The sauce is too watery.  The only thing you can taste is the vinegar.  The flour on the chicken makes the chicken slimy.  Might have been better if I threw in a can of cream of mushroom soup but I wanted to stick to the recipe before I made any changes.

I was not impressed by the flavor of this.  I assumed there would be plenty of sauce to put on some noodles, but it pretty much all cooked up to nothing.

I think you REALLY have to love balsamic vinegar to enjoy this.  The coating came off the chicken, the garlic was put in too soon (as per directions), and there wasn't enough sauce.  My family didn't care for this dish.

his dish is definitely worthy of special dinner guests. I made it as written, with the small addition of about 1/2 cup table cream just before serving. Very tasty!  I paired it with an unbelievably good spinach salad with roasted beets, candied walnuts and shaved parmesan. Read about it in my food blog, "Eating the Rainbow" at http://superfoodsyear.blogspot.com/2010/10/amazing-dinner-if-i-do-say-so-myself.html

Such a delicious recipe Colleen! I followed the directions exactly with the exception of gently simmering the breasts about twenty minutes instead of ten. The balsamic gave the most wonderful flavor to the dish and the broth mellowed it out just perfectly. Daughter Tyler is home from school this weekend and gave your recipe two thumbs up Colleen. Thank you so much!

I have to start out by saying I hate it when people give 5 stars but change the recipe.  But I'm doing it!  The ONLY change I made was to add the flour to the broth/vinegar mixture as opposed to coating/frying the chicken.  Next time I will add corn starch to the liquid and skip the flour.  But I must say, this was one AWESOME recipe!!!!

This was pretty tasty. The chicken was tender, considering the long simmering time (for breast meat). I followed the recipe pretty closely, but used fresh thyme since I had it on hand. Next time, I think I'll try roasting the garlic cloves ahead of time and adding more butter to the sauce for richness.

This was a fairly easy recipe, which I followed exactly. I have to disagree with the majority of reviewers and say that I wouldn't skip dredging the breasts in flour (which I seasoned), simply because the flour thickens the sauce slightly and gives the chicken a crispy outside. I cooked the sauce down for about 15 minutes to concentrate the flavors and served over angel-hair pasta.

I did spice up the "dredge" with onion powder, garlic powder, basil and oregano, omitted the bay leaf only because I didn't have any and I used organic chicken broth. I thought this was great. I think that if I hadn't spiced up the dredge, it would have been a little bland. It went well with the Portobello Penne Pasta Casserole. I'd make it again. This would make a GREAT sandwich filling, with gruyere cheese melted over the top.

OMG this is soooo good!  my mom and husband loved it too and it tastes like it was much harder to make than it is.  super easy but looks really fancy!  i didn't dredge the chicken in flour either, i just thickened the sauce at the end with a corn starch slurry (1 tbsp corn starch mixed with 1 tbsp cold water).  this is going in my regular rotation!!

Sprinkled parmesan on top. Didn't put the extra butter in the sauce at the end. Also used slightly thawed chicken breasts and put the salt, pepper and flour on them while in the pan.  Put over angel hair pasta.

This was wonderful!  I'm organizing meals for a friend this week, and one of our friends who was cooking said she was making this.  She pointed me here when I asked for the recipe, and we decided to make it tonight.  Not disappointed!  Notes: 1. I used more garlic than called for (probably 10 cloves?) and will probably use even more next time.  My garlic wasn't perfectly fresh, though, so probably 10 really fresh cloves would be ok.  2. I will double the sauce next time.  There wasn't enough - it was delicious!  3.  I served it over fettuccine.  4.  I didn't use mushrooms (not a fan), just fyi for others who don't like mushrooms and might wonder if the recipe works without them.  Yes, it does!!  :)  Thanks for sharing, colleenlora!

Thanks for sharing this fantastic recipe. I just finished preparing it.  All of the flavors meld great together. I did follow someone's advice about adding Rosemary and Crushed red pepper. I did dredge my chicken in flour it helped the texture of the sauce. Oh yeah, the best part is that it's easy and does not take alot of time to prepare. It is a KEEPER! M. Baker

This is a delicious and simple recipe, one you might expect to see on the menu of a good restaurant. After reading the suggestions of a few others, I decided to alter just some of the steps. I marinated the chicken a few tablespoons of vinegar and olive oil hours before preparing the meal, browned it for about 12 minutes, added the garlic/mushrooms/asparagus for another 3-5 minutes, then removed the chicken to a baking dish covered with foil before adding the vinegar and broth to the pan. I also added a small amount of corn starch and 1/4 cup cream to the mix and continued simmering until the asparagus was just right. Served the chicken over pasta drizzled with olive oil and more minced garlic and a touch of salt/pepper. I topped the whole thing with the vegetables and sauce from the pan. This method seemed to solve the "slimy chicken" some others experienced because it had been removed from the pan before adding the vinegar and broth. I strongly suggest anyone go ahead and use the flour mixture to coat the chicken (unlike what others suggested) as it definitely enhances the outcome of the entire dish and helps to contain the juices in the chicken. Just a few minor changes in the order of the original recipe and what an amazing dish!!!

This is an excellent recipe!  After reading the other reviews I decided to eliminate the flour and add a little bit of cornstarch at the end.  It worked out great!  Also, I only made 2 chicken breasts but I made the full amount of sauce.  That was just enough for my husband and I. So, if you like sauce you might want to keep that in mind.

I was worried that the balsamic vinegar would overpower the sauce, but it everything worked together. Very easy and delicious entree.

This was very good. It was great with whole grain pasta. I didn't have any chicken broth so I used vegetable broth and it turned out really tasty. I will be making this again!

I thought this was really good. I used around 10 garlic cloves instead of 6, and added the flour before the chicken stock to thicken up the sauce a little bit. I wish I had added a little less balsamic vinegar though, it was just a little overpowering for my taste. I served it for dinner with linguini, but after having some leftovers the next day with rice, I would suggest serving over rice rather than pasta. Overall, it was good--just not amazing.

I was a little concerned initially about SIX cloves of garlic,  but my crowd for Mother's Day lunch wiped it out!  Even the kids that won't touch a mushroom ate the chicken!  Very impressive & simple!

Love this one!  The sauce is flavorful and the chicken tender.  I don't particularly like mushrooms, but everything else about this is wonderful.  A good chicken recipe to add to the rotation!

excellent dish and very easy to make! I was in a rush when I made this the first time so I ended up using canned mushrooms and it was still delicious. I've switched it around a couple times, cooking just the mushrooms and eating it over pasta noodles with and without the chicken. It's been just as good every time.

The taste was really great. The chicken and mushrooms came out very tender. Even my 16 month old loved this dish. The only issue I had with this is that the sauce was too thin for my liking.

Add a dollop of honey for a sweeter taste. I use honey and balsamic vinegar and reduce it until it's syrupy and use that as a sauce for chicken or strawberries... don't knock it until you try it. I used a can of mushrooms and this came out fine. Good and easy dish.

I just made this last night and it was FANTASTIC.  A few things i did after reading a lot of the reviews: I marinated the chicken in chicken broth, enough to cover the breasts and then also put in 1/8 cup of Balsamic Vinega, and let sit for an hour. This made a HUGE difference in the flavor of the chicken. I only made 2 chicken breasts and i doubled the sauce, i should have tripled it, i had JUST enough for 2 servings. I cooked everything according to the exact times on the recipe and the chicken was so moist! At the end, i added 4 TB of heavy cream, to thicken up the sauce and i also lightened up the color. I served this over whole wheat penne pasta....tasted like something you would get at a fine Italian restaurant! This will definitely be a favorite of mine!!

This recipe was good, but not great.  One of the things that would have greatly improved it would be to use boneless chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts. Chicken breast are always so dry. the texture of the chicken ruin it for us. The sauce itself is good. I added sliced onions with garlic, and about a Tbs of sugar to the sauce right before finishing the sauce with the cornstarch slurry. (as per other reviews I opted for the cornstarch slurry to thickjen the sauce). I also skipped the flour.

This was just ok for me. If you really like balsamic vinegar, like my wife, you may really like this. But, it wasn't as tasty as I had hoped. The balsamic vinegar just overpowered it in my opinion. Not bad, but not on my favorites list.

A suprisingly delicate flavor.  The only change I made was skipping the flour, and that was just out of pure laziness.  Served it over pasta.  Mmmm.  Next time I'll make a fresh loaf of bread to soak up all the yummy sauce.

Turned out great!  I didn't have any mushrooms, and it still tasted great (though I'm sure it tastes better with mushrooms).  I served it over couscous.  It was a pretty easy recipe.  I will definitely make it again.

Super yummy.. Just made this for dinner and the hubby loved it. I didn't dip the chicken in the flour since I always find this method produces a gross texture to chicken. I am going to recoomend this to my family.

My husband nearly cried when he tasted the first bite. He thought it was so awesome! I took other reviewers' advice and added a little flour to the sauce to thicken it and it worked great. It must be the balsamic I used because the sauce had a slight wine flavor. Also didn't dredge in flour, as suggested by others. It was incredibly flavorful and a real keeper. Thanks!!

I liked the flour - but it did turn mushy.  Very flavorful and moist.  I also did flatten and cut in half my chicken breats.  And the sauce was perfect for 2 chicken breats.  I threw in my baby bella mushrooms w/ the broth and vinegar.  I served with sauted yellow squash - pretty colors.

This is a GREAT recipe! We love going to BJs and they make a wonderful balsamic chicken so I made a few changes to make it like that. First I didn't bread the chicken. I also omitted the mushrooms. (I love mushrooms, that just isn't where I wanted to go with this.) I cooked the sauce as is, other than that. After the balsamic reduction was done, I took thin slices of red onion and placed them in the pan that the chicken and sauce had been in. I added some more balsamic, some more chicken broth, and about a tablespoon of sugar. I cook them until they are tender. Then I place some fresh spinach on the plate, add a dollop of mashed potatoes, a chicken breast, and then the onion with balsamic reduction drizzle on the top. The presentation is beautiful and the taste is amazing.

Oh...my...gosh.  Made this for company, and it was a big hit.  I'm not big on vinegar, but cooked sauce for a bit longer, and the acid smell goes away and just leaves TONS of flavor.  Served with roasted potatoes, and was a great compliment to the dish.

In our family we call this "company good", ie great for serving to guests.  I, too, left out the dredging in flour.  The chicken was flavorful and moist and the sauce was wonderful.  Importantly, it's made from ingredients I often have on hand.

This recipe is AWESOME!  Quick and easy!  I made this with cut-up pieces of asparagus instead of the mushrooms, just because its snowy outside and thats what I had in the house.  I also added just a little bit of chardonnay when I added the asparagus to help it steam some more (probably not needed with mushrooms).  It turned out great, I served it over some bow-tie pasta.  I did not flour the chicken.  This recipe is wonderful as it is, and also as a great base for whatever else you may have lying around!

It was great, however I did not flour the chicken to save a little on fat, just browned the skinless boneless breasts, with grilling spices... I also added light sour cream and thickened it with corn starch,and served it over whole wheat penne pasta.

*****This is a good receipe but needed more sauce, also it was a bit salty from the chicken broth--used powdered, perhaps the carton broth would be better

Very good.  Based on reviews, I left the balsamic amount the same but added the whole can of broth and some sugar to counteract the acidity of the vinegar.  I also added a little bit of poultry seasoning and brined my chicken breats before proceeding with this recipe.

Definitely double the sauce, the mushrooms soaked up all the delicious sauce and I had little  left to spoon over the chicken.  I skipped the flour, as others advised.  I served it with brown rice and steamed broccoli - healthy and yummy dinner.  This is a good recipe for those of us who love balsamic and who love mushrooms.  My 5 year old wasn't at all interested, but I couldn't get enough!  I'll make this again when I have grown folks over for dinner!

Very good flavor...reminiscent of a filipino barbeque.  Next time i will try serving over rice instead of noodles.  as much as i wanted to like the breading...i agree with outher reviews, that it was probably unnecessary and maybe better without...will try skipping the flour step next time.

I made this last night.  I was disapointed.  The dish tasted ok, but I was expecting to be more wowed by it.  I like the balsamic flavor, but the chicken seemed soggy with the fried flour.  If I made again, I would either not brown the chicken with flour, or keep the chicken separate after browning, so the outside chicken is crisp. My family ate it, but noone was thrilled.

If there were more than 5 stars, I would give it to this recipe.  My husband flours the chicken and cooks is totally thru.  He removes the chicke from the skillet and makes the sauce.  We like to serve it on rice, so we double the sauce ingredients.  Thanks Colleen for a GREAT recipe!

Excellent!  Restaurant quality for sure, and healthy too!  The only change I made was to leave out the flour, like many other reviewers suggested.  I also pounded the chicken breasts an even thickness, which means that they were thinner and didn't have to cook as long (simmered covered for only about 5 minutes).  I served this with whole wheat linguine and steamed asparagus for a wonderfully tasty and healthy meal.

We were very disappointed in this recipe. My husband calls it "nasty" and that it didn't even deserve one star in his opinion. I, on the other hand didn't hate it but didn't like it either. The chicken turned out dry. Maybe it's the balsamic vinegar, we had never had it before, but I can't be sure. Just didn't suit our palate and I won't be making it again.

This was amazing! I will be adding this to our regular dinner rotation. I made a few changes. I used one large chicken breast half and sliced it in half so I had two thin pieces of chicken. I skipped the flour and butter. I increased chicken broth to 1 cup. Increased dried thyme to 1/2 tsp. Used 1/2 tsp. cornstarch to thicken things up a bit. Served over jasmine rice cooked in chicken broth and sweet peas on the side. Both my husband and I agreed that this was one excellent dinner!

Simple, fast and delicious, though I left out the flour after reading another review. I served with green beans and baked frozen fries which cooked while I was preparing the chicken. The whole family loved it!!

I love this dish.  I've made it four times now, and the last I changed it up a bit by not flouring the chicken prior to frying but adding a little flour to the reduction once the chicken was cooked to thicken it.  It was fantastic.

This was DELICIOUS!!! It is not often that my husband commends me on my cooking, but he could not stop saying how great it was. He even took leftovers for lunch the next day, which he NEVER does. I am a huge vinegar lover, and I loved the taste and how easy it was to make. This is defiantly a keeper!

I omitted the flour based on other reviews and increased the mushrooms to 1 lb. I also used six 4 oz chicken breast portions. Otherwise, I followed the recipe to the letter.  This is an awesome atop some noodles; I used shiratake noodles and spooned the sauce over it. Magnifique!

Tasty. The Balsamic vinegar really mellows. Drop the flour. there's really no need for it except for a sauce thickener and I think I'll add cornstarch as suggested. I thought the flour gave the chicken a texture that didn't bring anything to the dish.  A good recipe, I'd definitely recommend it as well as make it again. Served with asparagus.

I made this when my parents were visiting and my Mom can't stop saying how much she liked it. The only change I made is I didn't dredge the chicken in flour as my Dad needs to eat low carb.

One of our faves! Super flavorful, quick and easy. I omit the flour and just cook in a little oil. Thicken up with a little cornstarch at the end if you want a little thicker sauce.

I made this tonight for our date night along with mashed new potatoes with garlic butter and brown sugar glazed carrots. My husband LOVED this chicken and so did I. Sadly, I didn't have mushrooms but I only missed them because I knew that they were supposed to be in there.  The vinegar  mellows out quite nicely and you're left with a rich delicious sauce and a perfectly cooked piece of chicken. Bookmark this recipe and don't forget about it.

I would give this 4.5 stars if I could. This is not a 5 star recipe though because I had to reduce the amount of the red wine vinegar because it would have been too overpowering as is.  I only used 1/8 cup like many of the other reviewers suggested. I thought the sauce was very good, especially with the mushrooms.  I served with red roasted potatoes and asparagus.

Fantastic Recipe!  I used polmagranite balsamic vinegar from the Naples Olive Oil company in Naples Florida.  They have tons fo different flavored oils and balsamic vinegars.  any would work for this recipe!  The house smelled wonderful and the chicken was a nice variation of flavor.  Will be making this one again!  Thanks for the recipe

Understand that this recipe makes a good (not great) chicken.  We followed the recipe for the sauce as is and did not care for it. We drained the sauce off of the mushrooms and had a very ho hum chicken dish.  When I see a dish on this site that more than 1,000 people have rated greater than four stars, I REALLY expect more.

We loved this.  I added onions and omitted the flour.  I'm not a huge fan of mushrooms so next time I'm going to try artichokes instead of mushrooms.  Great recipe!

I was really expecting something spectacular after reading several of the reviews, but this dish was just a standard week day meal, nothing to really set it a part from all the other reduction type pasta dishes. Like many others, I added 1 tbspn of cream at the end (the sauce was just not thickening properly).  It was good and I may make it again, but certainly not in an attempt to impress anyone with the taste or presentation. While chibi chef's photo is beautiful, and I really tried to make mine look like that, it's just not a 'pretty' dish (look at the other photos).

This was nice.  The only thing I'd change to the base recipe is a bit less balsamic.  Beyond the base, I think I might add slices of onion.

I know this sounds harsh when compared to other reviews.  Let me explain.  3 stars for me means I would try this recipe again, hoping to find the right modifications to make it work for us.  That is to say this recipe is inspirational but doesn't quite work for us as is and I'm a little stumped as to how to fix it. But... I'm willing to give it another try because there was a lot that worked with it.  4 stars means good as is with little or no modification.  5 stars means my whole family wants this recipe any day, anytime. In other words, a 5 star rating is a 'boo-ya'!  This recipe is a 3 star for us, and that's a good thing.  I was very impressed with how incredibly tender and moist the chicken came out.  Also, it was easy and fast, also a plus.  On the minus side, the vinegar over-powered the dish and I am a lover of balsamic vinegar.  I will try this recipe again, perhaps adding some red wine and/or cream to mellow out the vinegar.  Give it a try.  It's worth it.  Perhaps someone more knowledgeable than I will have a suggestion for mellowing out the vinegar?

I would give this 10 stars if I could!  It was WONDERFUL!  It's my favorite recipe on this site by far!  And it's so easy to make.  I pretty much followed the recipe exactly, but used italian seasoning instead of thyme because that's all I had.  I served it with spinach mushroom risotto and it was to die for!  The leftovers were even better!  My whole house smelled like a fine dining experience!  Thank you for this recipe!  It will be in our weekly rotation!

Very good, but if you go too far with the balsamic, you could easily just end up with balsamic chicken. It will have the tendency to override the delicate herbs completely.   If using bouillon instead of broth, use NO salt and cut even further back on the balsamic. Also, I doubled the thyme and bay to counter the bouillon saltiness, as well as using a bit more water to dilute it a bit.   The flour, I put in at the very end using a little sieve, tapping a bit here and then a bit there and stirring it in without lumps. I think I used about a tablespoon all told. A little goes a long way.  I cooked oyster mushrooms that I had cut long and thin (to resemble noodles) separately in 4 tablespoons of melted butter, a 1/4 cup white wine and 1 crushed clove of garlic and used that as the foundation instead of noodles as shown in the photo. It made for an interesting change from the same old same old noodle/rice/potatoes routine. And the earthy tones balanced the sharpness of the chicken nicely.   I served this dish with gingered carrots & dates (found on allrecipes) and we drank a Provençal rosé. I will be making this meal again in the future. Bon apetit!

OMGoodness! This was wonderful! Made it  exactly as written, dredging the chicken. Got a nice syrupy tasty sauce and moist, tender chicken.  Hubby said "Ravishing!" and had seconds.  Made Orzo and roasted zucchini/tomato side dishes. A restaurant quality dinner at home! This is definately a new "go to" keeper.

Very nice flavor and the chicken cooked beautifully. I cut down on the garlic and added the leftover flour to the sauce for thickness. If you like this, you'll LOVE the chicken marsala submitted by Lisa.

Amazing!!! No one could stop eating this. I didn't have any mushrooms, bay leaves, or garlic cloves and I didn't miss them. In place of the garlic cloves I used garlic powder. I doubled the sauce and added a little brown sugar and a squirt of ketchup to it and it was wonderful. I omitted the flour and added cornstarch after taking the chicken out. We're having the leftover chicken over our salad tonight.

Delicious! Used fewer mushrooms with regret... did use baby bella, though. Next time will cut chicken after initial sautee. Used penne pasta. Husband and I both loved this recipe. Even kids liked the flavor of the chicken. May use white balsamic next time, it does have a very dark color with regular balsamic. Also, doubled the sauce portion.

I was so excited to try this recipe. After taking the first bite, I was extremely disappointed. I love the ingredients in other dishes, but the amounts requested for this recipe did not work. The vinegar was overpowering. Too many mushrooms for the amount of chicken as well.

Just cleaned up from this meal and there are no leftovers.  I will put this chicken recipe in the rotation to make a couple times a month...wonderful.  Used canned mushrooms, garlic powder and only 1/8 cup of vinegar other than that followed exactly.

This was a very simple, quick dinner that got 2 thumbs up from my fiance and myself. I marinated the chicken while it was thawing out and didn't include mushrooms (fiance hates them) and followed the advice of others and didn't dredge in flour. I see this being a family get together favorite.

This was very good.  I made a few changes based on the suggestions of others.  I omitted flouring the chicken breasts. I pounded them flat before cooking so that they would cook more evenly. I used sliced portabello mushrooms and just a little bit less (1 TBS) of the balsamic vinegar.  Nice flavor.  Great quick and easy recipe for chicken breasts.

The recipe was very good. I loved the sauce and the chicken was tender. The only thing I might do next time is marinate the chicken in a garlic mixture so the meat inside has more flavor. Overall, it was very good!

This is a FANTASTIC dish! I have made it several times already since I found the recipe a month ago. I use 2 chicken breasts instead of 4 (there are only 2 of us eating it). Be careful - follow the quantities in the recipe and the timing, regardless if you are using less chicken. The last time that I made the chicken, I followed the timing to a T and the chicken was moist and fully cooked. Previous times I had adjusted the quantities of liquid and the length of cooking time - chicken turned out dry and not enough sauce.

The recipe is pretty tasty and easy to make.  I skipped the flour and added cornstach to the balsamic reduction to thicken.  Next time, I'll probably reduce the amount of balsamic vinegar - this was a bit too acidic for me...

This was very good.  My husband and I really enjoyed and I will have to make again when our girls are home.  I did change the recipe a bit with what I had on hand.  I used 1 can of mushrooms instead of fresh and added some fresh parsley and green onion when I added all liquid/spice at the end.  I also filleted my chicken into thin pieces.  Other than that I followed the recipe and will make again

this recipe was really good and flavorful.  I took 1 reviewers suggestion and skipped the flour breading.  I just browned the chicken breasts in oil w/o any breading and they came out perfect.

Wow! This is an excellent and really easy recipe. I couldn't find the balsamic in the cupboard so I used wine vinegar instead.  It was a good substitute. As well I used boneless chicken thighs and they were very tender and moist.  Thanks so much for the recipe. I will definitely make it again.  Even my ridiculously picky teenaged daughter enjoyed it.

Often I have had bad luck with cooking chicken in a saute pan on the stovetop - often it dries out. This recipe made for juicy and flavorful chicken, and great leftovers for the next day - if there is any left! Thanks for the recipe.

I liked; husband said it was "just a smidge away" from being true gourmet; 13-yr old and 10-yr old didn't like (13 yr old will eat most anything; she didn't like the balsamic taste).  I served on fettucine and omitted flour on chicken but stirred some into sauce.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  After reading some reviews I omitted the flour.  We're also not big fans of thyme so I used some dried dill instead.  It came out great, I'm definitely adding this to my recipe files.

As Randy Jackson would say, "I don't know, Dawg.  It was just OK for me."  Maybe I didn't season the chicken enough because the sauce seemed to be missing a little something, a zing.  Maybe a little lemon/zest?  Capers?  I'll give it a try again.

Absolutely amazing!  Made this recipe and followed it to a tee - apart from cutting the garlic down to 3 cloves instead of 6.  Amazing and I am definitely going to cook it again.  Make sure you use high quality balsamic vinegar when making this though, it makes a world of difference!  The sauce really thickened up and didn't taste vinegary at all.  I made linguine pasta to go with the chicken and it really went well, the sauce stuck to the pasta well and tasted delicious - in fact it was one of the nicest pasta sauces I've ever tasted!!!  A really good recipe that is easy to do, doesn't have a million ingredients and tastes like a restaurant quality meal.  Thanks for sharing.

This dish reiterates the fact that I need to start photographing my food! It looked, smelled and tasted great. My only change was omitting the flour, then adding a slurry (cornstarch/water) near the end instead of reducing the sauce. I used baby bella shrooms, fat free low sodium broth, and served over wild/white rice. Even my 14mo ate everything.

I loved the ease of this dish, and the fact that it's a one pot meal. Good flavor, although next time I would add some more spices for extra flavor. It was still a pretty good dish, and a great weeknight go-to.

Very good.  My only suggestion would be to be careful not to use too much flour on the chicken--mine was a little too thick, and the breading fell off and make the sauce a little lumpy.  It still tasted really good, though.

My Dad, who frequents this site, gave me this recipe a few years back.  It has been a a favorite ours, but I hadn't made it for a while.  I stumbled across it on this site and made it again tonight without any changes.  This one is a home run every time.  I've only made it with pasta before, but tonight tried it with wild rice and it was great.  The rice totally soaked up the sauce.  DELICIOUS!!!

This was sooo tasty.  I added garlic powder to the chicken before frying, eliminated the flour and added corn starch to the sauce instead.  I served it over linguine.  It was delicious!

Excellent recipe!  Like other chefs I did not use flour.  For the mushrooms I used the Trompet de Morte variety.  They were absolutely tender as was the chicken.

THIS RECIPE WAS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. I FOLLOWED ALL DIRECTIONS AND MADE ONLY 1 SUBSTITUTION. I USED BASIL INSTEAD OF THYME BECAUSE I WAS OUT OF IT. IT IS VERY VERY STRONG VINEGAR FLAVORED BUT NOT TO THE POINT OF BEING TO MUCH. IF YOU LIKE BALSAMIC VINEGAR BUT ARE NOT A SUPER SUPER FAN THEN I SUGGEST REDUCING THE VINEGAR BY HALF. ALL IN ALL THIS IS DESTINED TO BE A FAMILY FAVORITE. BRAVO!!!

Yummy!!  I skipped the flour and added sun-dried tomatoes and extra garlic. I like that it's pretty healthy and delicious at the same time. Definitely would make this one again.

This was a huge hit with my family!  I didn't dredge the breasts, but otherwise I followed this recipe to the letter. The result was tender, flavorful chicken that my entire family enjoyed. Even my picky 9-year-old loved this, and has repeatedly requested I make it again.  Thank you so much to the original poster for sharing this recipe.

My Husband and I normally do not care for Chicken Breasts as they are usually too dry. This recipe was 2 thumbs up! The breasts were tender. I added a bit more chicken broth as I went along. I added 1/8 cup Balsamic Vinegar instead of the 1/4 with an additional dash here or there. It was just right! I will be making this again!!

I had high hopes for this recipe, being a balsamic vinegar lover.  I anticipated a tangy and flavorful sauce.  Unfortunately it was just tart.  And I mean pucker tart!  The vinegar overwhelmed and needed a sweet counterbalance that was missing.  Sorry, just not our taste.

This definitely tasted good, but it was not as fantastic as I thought it would be with all of the rave reviews, especially since I feel that it took a lot longer than 30 min to cook.  4 stars.

SO GOOD! Easy to make, chicken was juicy and flavorful.  I seriously would have been happy to have been served this in a restaurant, I thought it turned out so great.  Made me feel like a I was a great chef, but I think the credit goes to a great recipe!

If you are a onion lover like me, you can add some sliced onions to the initial stage of the recipe, where you are sauteeting your garlic. I have made this, my way, for quite an array of tastes(and personalities), and every single one of them has said it was great. I have even omitted the garlic and used a combination of onions and leeks with satisfying results, but I really think the onions and garlic is the best combination. Watch the time! This dish is best when the chicken is just done.

I followed the recipe with the exception of the flour, but this sauce did not reduce well.  It never got thick but instead just went away so when I added the butter that ended up making the sauce.

I was thrilled to find this recipe on a week night at 5:30 with no idea for supper, and chicken that needed to be cooked. This was a delicious, quick meal for our family...my husband and my 2 small children wanted seconds! SUCCESS!

I cooked it as is. served over brown rice. so simple, and so delicious.

This was good, but when I made it exactly as the recipe said, the chicken did turn out a little slimy (for lack of a better word) when it was done.  Next time, I'll make it without the flour.  The flavor was really good, and my one non-picky-eater child enjoyed it, but the other three wouldn't touch it, because they didn't like how it looked!  :)

After seeing the reviews on this recipe, I couldn't wait to taste it. Even though I followed the recipe to a "t" (except I used the recommendation of another member to increase the garlic). It was the most tasteless chicken, but we agreed the sauce was ok on the pasta I served with it. I threw the recipe away.

This was okay.  The next time I make it, I will modify considerably.  I know Balsamic is in the name but I think the amount called for is too much as the flavor was too bold for my taste.

This is a fantastic dish!  I agree with other reviewers, this tastes like restaurant quality.  After reading so many of the reviews, I couldn't understand how such a quick dish, with a few basic ingredients, could come together so nicely.  I used chicken breasts I had flattened at the butcher and it came out so tender that the meat was falling apart as I was plating it. I added thinly sliced white onion as it was cooking and used cornstarch dissolved in water to thicken it slightly.  Aside from that, I stuck to the recipe.  I served this with buttered and seasoned egg noodles.  This is an incredibly rich tasting dish.  My husband and I both loved it.  I will definitely make this again, especially for company when we're entertaining.

Very good and very tasty! I added a splash of white wine at the end with the butter to put this over the edge. I'll definitely be making this again.

This is a delicious recipe!!!!  I'm a mushroom lover so next time I cook this (which will be soon) I'm going to add more mushrooms at the end when you remove chicken and simmer sauce for 7 minutes.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

I found this recipe to be pretty good. I, like the other reviewers, also skipped the flour and pounded the chicken breast. I might have pounded them too thin though because my chicken came out very dry. I will adjust next time I make this. I also seasoned the mushrooms(portabellos) with salt and pepper and garlic powder and they came out fantastic.

Both my husband and son enjoyed this recipe.  There were a couple of changes I made, and I will make more for next time.
I used minced garlic instead of cloves.  No problem there.  I served it over spaghetti--but with that there wasn't enough juice.

Next time:  add more chicken broth.  Use salted broth or lightly salt chicken.  I'll reduce the cooking time of the chicken--it was a little overdone by keeping it warm while reducing the sauce.  

Because of the quick cooking time and the wonderful flavor, we will use this again.

I really enjoyed this dish. The chicken was delicious and juicy.  I loved the balsamic and mushroom sauce.  I omitted the flour as others suggest and added a little cornflour to the sauce.  I will definately make this recipe again and would be happy serving it to friends.

We loved this - I made this recipe as written except used only 2 chicken breasts - We thought it was great - however I didn't have much sauce leftover as the mushrooms absorbed most of the liquid.  Looking forward to making this one again soon.

Very nice--and easy.  Love those one-pan dishes.  The sauce was lovely, although mine didn't reduce much, so I added some cornstarch and water to thicken it up.  The chicken was quite tender, and the fragrance was amazing.

I made this after coming off of a 13 hour work day. It was fast, easy, and delicious. I made double amounts of the sauce and added diced plum tomatoes as others had recommended. I also added the leftover flour to the sauce, which helped to thicken it nicely. My boyfriend was (is still!) raving about this. He couldn't believe how good it tasted for me spending only 35 minutes in the kitchen! I absolutely will make this recipe again.

Really tasty.  I didn't make any changes to this recipe.  It can be pulled together quickly after work, which is key.  And to top it all off it tasted even better as left overs!  Definitely putting this one in the rotation.

This was easy to prepare and I had every thing in my staples which is always a bonus.  The chicken is flavorfull and moist.  I only wish I had reduced the liquid down more for a more syrupy sauce then added the mushrooms.  I think the mushrooms were preventing my sauce from really reducing.  Thanks for sharing.

Very tasty! Followed recommendation of another and did not use flour.  Also, I removed the chicken and sauteed the mushrooms and garlic by themselves -- space limitations.  Otherwise followed recipe as is.

Wow! Fantastic...everyone loved this. The extra sauce is great with some garlic mashed potatoes. I did not have fresh mushrooms at the house, so I used 16 oz. of canned mushrooms instead...I scaled the recipe for 6 chicken breasts. I also doubled the garlic and butter...delicious!! The chicken was so tender!

this was excellent. I love balsamic vinegar in my recipes. After reading the debates to flour or not to flour the chicken, I went down the middle. I used an extremely light dusting. It was just enough to put some body in the sauce and reducing at the end was key. When I first put the liquid ingredients together, I saved about 1/4C and used it on chicken shish kabobs as a marinade and and about 3T for basting. Was great there too, really enhanced the vegetables. Next time, I am going to make it using beef broth and smother a couple of beef filets with it! You have got to try this one.

My family really liked this. I reduced the Balsamic and it was still a bit strong but that might be because I bought it at the Italian Market. Hubby observed that the sauce would be good on potatoes.

Super Recipe. Next time I would double
the sauce and fillet my chicken breasts
to absorb even more of that great flavor.
Thank You for Sharing

I would use a thicker chicken breast for this recipe to ensure it stays juicy.

My family loved this dish! I left out the flour per other reviewers but added a little bit of corn starch at the end. So easy to make and loved the sauce!

I thought this recipe was great! I coated the chicken with egg and rubbed it in Italian Bread Crumbs instead of flour. Even my kids ate this! I will definitely put this in my recipe box.

Great recipe, left the flour off because I didn't want the extra calories. I didn' find the vinegar too strong. It was terrific and everyone in my large family loved it. As a matter of fact I'm making it again today! Thanks!

This was good, but it just needs a little extra something. I'm not sure what that is yet, but I will figure it out! Maybe next time I will go a little heavier on the balsamic. This was easy to make and there were no leftovers!

FABULOUS!! My family loved this recipe.  The only change I made was that after coating with flour, I coated the chicken in a bread crumb mixture.  The sauce this makes is so good, I am thinking of what else I could make with this. Maybe pork medallions?? Thanks for a great recipe.

This was just ok.  IF I were to make it again I'm definetly leaving out the flour, some of it came off the chicken  and it left weird floaties in the sauce and made the whole dish really unappealing.

Definitely a 5 star recipe! I started cooking with balsamic vinegar a few months ago as a way to flavor enhance in an attempt to cut other additions that added calories. This is a quick and easy recipe.
I'm not a mushroom eater so I left them out. I did flour the tops of the chicken but will probably leave it out as I don't think it will take anything away from the flavor. I cut the recipe in half since I cook for one, but from now on will make the sauce in the full amount. I believe my suace cooked down faster as my stovetop runs a little hot! I also left out the butter at the end, didn't need it. I did use what sauce I did have mixed in with new potatoes I roasted.Thanks for the recipe! Chicken always needs a boost!

This was just OK for us. My family didn't think it was great. I disliked the way the flour came off and floated around the sauce in slimy little clumps. And, the sauce was fairly weak and did not really penetrate the chicken. The best part was the mushrooms - they seemed to retain a lot of the flavor from the sauce. I have another chicken skillet recipe that calls for Balsamic vinegar and is more of a glaze. I think it is much better than this one.

Very tasty!  It reminds me of filipino chicken adobo.  I didn't change any of the ingredients.  The only things I did different was mix in chicken thighs and added a thickening agent to the sauce at the end.  Yummy :)

This is a nice dinner, relatively easy.  I love balsamic vinegar!  I would probably let the meat marinate a bit if I make this again, that way the flavor would really infuse into the meat.  The sauce was nice, but it didn't really give the meat itself enough flavor for my taste.

I made this for my family.  I used margarine rather than butter and it worked out fine. We love mushrooms so I just about doubled the mushrooms (there's never enough!) and served it with some plain broccoli and white rice.  Definitely a healthy meal.  Everyone loved it.

What a great and easy week night meal. I pounded my chicken breast down so they would cook faster and skipped the whole flour step. I did add a onion with the mushrooms. I used the whole can of chicken broth and thickened it up with some corn starch. I think that really gave the sauce a nice sweet flavor and the balsamic vinegar didn't overwhelm the flavor.

I thought the flavor was pretty good.  The vinegar taste did not bother me as it did some others.  I added more garlic (8 cloves sliced) and I thought it could have used more.  Also, the flour did give it a bit of a mushy texture which I did not care for.  I think I will try it again and see if I can prepare it better next time.

This recipe was very good.  I did cut down the balsamic vinegar to 1/8 cup (2T) b/c it was something new to my kids and I didn't want it to overpower them.  They loved it.  Also, I made it with frozen broccoli florets instead of the mushrooms b/c my husband is allergic.  Make sure you add the florets towards the end of cooking or else they'll get mushy.  Ask me how I know.

Easy, quick, healthy,and scrumptious!  I left out the flour and added extra garlic...I used portibello mushrooms, which created an absolutely decadent effect!  Served over brown rice.  Finally, a sure bet when having the in-laws over for dinner! :D

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I will definitely be adding it to our family cookbook.  However, we do love balsamic vinegar so I added more than suggested along with more chicken broth and also threw in a ton more mushrooms.  Wonderful!!

This was such an easy, delicious meal!  I had some chicken breast, and wanted to try something different.  This was FULL of flavour, each bite was different.  Now, I am not a mushroom eater, and I almost omitted them from the recipe.  DO NOT DO SO.  They are the key to the flavor.  They hold so many different juices in them, it's incredible!  I made this for my wife and myself, she is 6 months pregnant.  She loved it!  And I'm sure our baby did too!  Great recipe, will definitely make again!

I followed the recipe almost to a tee with the exception of I added a piece of fresh rosemary sprig to it while simmering, which added a nice flavor. I did add more juice and mushrooms and it came out delish !!!! Will make it again.

I just made this for dinner, and I am so pleased with this dish! My six year old who doesn't eat anything actually said it was excellent.(although I did not pour the sauce over hers, and gave her the mushrooms on the side.) My husband told me that I "better have this recipe ready for the next time we have dinner guests". I did not add the butter at the end, and I thought it could have added a nice touch to the flavor, but was not necessary.Thanks for a superb recipe!!!

Unfortunately, I didn't have any mushrooms on hand so I didn't include them.  I think the recipe would have turned out a lot better with them.  I'll be sure to give this one another try.

Very good! I didn't have any mushrooms, so instead used red bell peppers, and they added a wonderful sweetness to the sauce. Yum! I also didn't have any chicken broth, so I just made up chicken bouillon. THe reduction was easy, and chicken tasted wonderful. Will definitely make it again!

This was very tasty and had a good mix of flavors.  My 2 and 4 yr olds even ate it.  I did have to make some adjustments (based on what I had in the house)  Since I had no mushrooms or onions I used 1/2 can of diced tomatoes (garlic, basil and oregano flavored) drained and a can of water chestnuts (drained).  I really liked the tomatoes in it (will use those again!) and the water chestnuts absorbed the flavors and gave it crunch--but next time I think I'll try the mushrooms.  I used dried rosemary instead of Thyme.  And I added in 2 tsps. of heavy cream at the end, as some reviewers suggested.  Used 10 cloves of garlic, which was great.  Also, had to use 1 cube of chicken bullion in 1 cup water instead of chicken broth.  But even with my forced substitutions this came out great! Nice easy, basic recipe to play around with.  Served over basmati rice and it was a hit! I will definitely make again--only will make more sauce as it disappeared fast.

it was good. the mushrooms were awesome, the chicken was moist. did 1/2 cup chicken brothe, 1/4 white wine. i would add more mushrooms next time becuase they were so tasty. it was not "vineagery" at all.  served over whole wheat egg noodles and sauteed asparagus. Yum.

We really liked this recipe. I used baby bellas and near the end, I thickened the sauce with a little cornstarch because we don't like thin sauces as much. It thickened right up! I would probably double the sauce next time because we like extra sauce. Will make again!

wow, i've never cooked with Balsamic as the base sauce before and I thought it would be overpowering.  After simmering for almost 20min, the sauce became calming and the chicken was very tender.  De-lish.

This was good. I think I did not use enough garlic.  Chicken breast might have been to thick and came out too dry. I will use a thinner portion of chicken next time round.

I made this recipe tonight exactly as stated. I was very pleased and my family also enjoyed the meal. I served it over a bed of spaghetti noodles. One suggestion, for those that thought the chicken was slimy, I would suggest following the recipe with the exception of fully cooking the chicken and removing it before incorporating the liquid.

This was wonderful! I changed it a bit, didn't coat the chicken, nor did I have mushrooms, so I used green beans. And I added white wine while cooking chicken and to the gravy afterwards. It was so flavorful!  Great and easy recipe. Thanks! My kids both (6 and 4) LOVED it and had seconds!!

This was great. While I was preparing it, I thought "This could be a great 'Thirty Minute Meal'".  It was very diferent from all other chicken recipes and I can see a lot of options for change.  Thanks for something different!

This is my all time favorite recipe!  Extreme flavor is how I would characterize.  I've even gone more low fat by browing the chicken without the oil and flour...simply using cooking spray.  Tastes fabulous regardless!

This was very tasty! We didn't have any mushrooms on hand, so we left them out. I did add a bit of cornstarch at the end to thicken the sauce. We served it with some mashed potatoes and carrots. Even the kiddos loved it. Next time I'll double the sauce. The chicken was very nice and tender.

This has got to be my favorite chicken dish - as well as my husband's favorite. The balsamic vinegar makes the chicken so tender and juicy and how can you not just love garlic? I did omit the mushrooms because my husband hates them and it was still delicious. I served this for a Christmas dinner and everyone raved.

We really enjoyed this chicken dish. The balsamic vinegar, chicken broth, thyme and mushrooms make a wonderfully fragrant sauce. I followed another reviewer's advice and served this with roasted red potatoes. The leftovers were good, too.

Since I didn't follow the recipe exactly I am going to give this 4 stars. I think I probably used too much garlic, water and olive oil as the sauce tasted watery to me.  I will try it again following the recipe exactly.

This is a really good chicken recipe. I was in a big hurry to get dinner on the table, I forgot to put the flour on the chicken before putting it on the skillet, I only had canned mushrooms, and still it was delicious!!!!! I did sprinkle some flour in the sauce to thicken it but I don't think it needed it. Also it cooked even faster using chicken tenders. I served it with pasta and the Italian peas...sooo good!!! Thanks for the post!!!!!

I would give this 5 stars if the flavors absorbed more into the chicken.  Otherwise, this was quite good.  Followed the recipe as written, however I only cooked 2 large (pounded out) chicken breasts and made the regular amount of sauce.

This was great and it tasted yummy! I added a bit of oregano to the flour in addition to the salt and I also added flour at the end to make the sauce thicker.  I made four pieces of chicken breast and doubled the sauce.  It was perfect.  My husband really liked it.

This was a good recipe, though it was a little too tangy for my personal taste; maybe next time I will slightly reduce the vinegar.  I served it with a quick side of Zatarain's Long Grain/Wild Rice.  It went very well with the flavor of the sauce.

Excellent and EASY. You will want to make extra sauce - add some wine to the vinegar and use a pound of mushrooms.  It's even better the next day.

I made this meal last night and found it to be very tasty. There was just enough of the balsamic vinegear to give your taste buds a work out, but not too overpowering. I also added a little white wine which made this dish even more flavorful. I did cut back on the garlic, using only 4 decent size cloves, as I did not want the garlic to mask the taste of the meal. I will definitely be making this meal again. It was very easy!

Very good. Took one reviewers advice and cut the chicken into pieces before cooking. The smaller pieces made it excellent over rice.

I did have to thicken the sauce with a little cornstarch.

Loved it! Great flavor! Used about 12 cloves of garlic. Very easy to make.  I paired it with roasted garlic rosemary potatoes and salad. Minus the cooking, I felt like I was eating takeout from a restaurant.

Followed the recipe & would only make the following change. Says to remove chicken and keep warm. I accidently left a portion of chicken in the sauce as it was reducing. I found that this portion had MUCH more flavor than the rest after I pulled it out of the oven and poured the sauce on it. Next time, I'll leave all of the chicken to simmer in the sauce instead of removing it. Otherwise - very good dish.

This was delicious!! I was thinking ahead and pulled up this website around noon.(love this site)  That gave me time to marinate my chicken.  I too omitted flouring it, but did add a couple squeezes of my balsamic vinaigrette salad dressing.(then only add a tiny bit of balsamic vinegar to sautee) After marinating about 2hrs, I simply sauteed the marinated chicken from the bag for a few minutes,, before adding the remaining marinade mixture from the bag.  I flipped it a few times and it was perfectly juicy after about 15 minutes. *MAKE SURE THE MARINADE BOILS A FEW MINS* We personally enjoyed it with pasta, but any starch would fit; very versitile! Thanks!!

Excellant recipe.  Family loved it and that is hard as my 8 year old doesn't like to try new things.  Recipe is easily convertable as I had canned mushrooms and minced garlic and no bay leaves.  Next time though will use fresh mushrooms and portabellas.

Made this tonight for dinner. The only changes I made was to increase the garlic cloves (used 8) and added some extra broth (I didn't measure, but probably an extra half cup). The chicken was super moist and tender, and the sauce was to die for. I served it with white rice cooked in chicken broth and a green salad. Two thumbs up! Thanks for the recipe.

I have been making this for years ever since seeing Pierre Franey make it on TV.  It is wonderful as written, but also is great with artichoke hearts added.  I always pound the chicken breast before cooking.  If you don't love the taste of balsamic vinegar, the addition of some cream at the end makes it not so strong. Great recipe!

Great recipe. I cooked it just as recipe called and I loved the flavor. The mushrooms took on the flavor of the vinegar and were delicious. I might add more mushrooms next time since they were so good. I served this on a bed of rice with a salad on the side.

Easy recipe, but the balsamic overpowered all the other flavors.  If I make again, I will reduce the amount of vinegar.  The chicken did turn out very tender though!

I made this dish as the recipe states with two minor differences - I didn't have fresh mushrooms so I used canned instead, and I left the chicken in the pan for the last 5-7 minutes of simmer time.  The chicken was very flavorful and juicy and paired up nicely with couscous and steamed veggies.  Those who like more sauce should probably shorten the last few minutes of cooking time or increase the liquid.  Another hit!

YUM!  This was really good.  I made it on a night when the bfriend was working late because he abhors vinegar.  I had to scale it to one chicken breast which was really easy.  I am a huge fan of sauted chicken and I am always looking for another variation (it seems endless!)  This method worked perfectly and the result was soooo tasty.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is my favorite company chicken recipe.  So easy and tastes so very very good.  The only thing I learned the hard way is to be sure and use WHITE balsamic vinegar.  The dark balsamic vinegar is to strong and overbearing.

This worked out perfectly and the sauce on the chicken and mushroom was nice a tangy sweet.  If you don't like balsamic this is not for you, as it is a very dominant flavor.

Nothing wrong with this one! Very good!  I did add a bit of extra liquid (as others mentioned)but still let it reduce.  I can understand other reviewers who were not thrilled with the basalmic vinegar.  If basil and/or vinegar are not on your favourites list then this is not for you.  I too, pounded out two chicken breasts and had plenty to serve three. I did the chicken first, put it aside, then the garlic, mushrooms(and some sweet onion, added the liquid and put the chicken back in. Don't belittle the bay leaf and thyme, they DO add flavour!  Thanks Colleen, this is going in my book.

Oh Yum. Just YUM!. I had this last night for dinner and was very very happy with the outcome. I made a couple of minor changes to the recipe and that was to add fresh chopped spinach during the last few minutes of cooking time and to add some diced red onion with the garlic. Not much better than the combo of spinach, mushrooms and garlic. :) I also chopped the chicken in bite sized pieces instead of cooking the breasts whole. I think did use a bit more stock than the recipe called for. This was a very quick, very tasty meal that will be made again and again.

This really was tasty!  I made this for a friend on  a low carb diet, so I left out the flour...she couldn't believe that this was "ok" on her diet because it tasted so good!  will definitely make again!

Very good - different.  I pounded the chicken breasts thin, use some portabello and button mushrooms, instead of flour I used 2 tsp cornstarch, added 1/2 onion chopped and sauted them w/mushrooms.  I would use a little less balsamic vinegar next time - it's very strong in flavor.  Served with baked potato wedges and green beans.

Excellent recipe.  I let the sauce reduce down a bit more--probably 10 minutes total.  I will be making this again and again.  It's weeknight simple, yet company worthy!

This was a wonderful recipe!  I liked that it could all be made in one pan so clean up was easy!  To make the recipe even better for you, I used whole wheat flour to dredge the chicken breasts in.  I also thickened the gravy a bit with whole wheat flour at the end.  Also, I didn't have enough fresh mushrooms on hand so I used canned.  It was great!

The balsamic vinegar (a flavor that I usually love) really overpowered this dish. The flavor of bay leaf and thyme were undetectable. Sorry, but I won't be making this again.

I apparently put on too much flour, because the breasts ended up slimy.  I thought the flavor was good, but not great.  In my opinion, not as awful as some other reviewers indicated.  Regardless, I don't know that I'll make this again.

I suggest using 1/4c balsalmic vinegar, then add up to 1/2c if needed.  Apparently some brands have more "punch" than others.  We did enjoy the dish.

This was a attractive and easy to prepare dish.  I made it exactly how it was written except I just realized I forgot the thyme.  I didn't care for the flavor of the vinager in the sauce, even as mild as it was, as much as I thought I would but can easily see how the addition of onions and other herbs would be a big plus.

I also omitted the flour, and added more broth and onions. I pan fried potatoes in another pan and added them to the sauce the last few minutes and this recipe was a big hit.
Will make it at my next dinner party.

This recipe is awesome! I'm always looking for ways to kick up chicken breast and this definitely did the trick. This dish is SO flavorful! The only modifications I made was I added 1 cup of chicken broth as opposed to 3/4 cups. I also added the garlic to the pan just a minute or so before I added the broth and balsamic because I was afraid the garlic would burn. My husband and even my 16 month old loved it. This recipe will definitely become a standard in my household.

I wish I could add more stars. This is a truly delicious recipe. I prepared as directed, although I did marinate the breasts in balsamic vinegar, salt & pepper before coating with flour. As it is written, this has the 'feel' of a professional recipe and the taste is superb. My husband was ecstatic!  I served it with a buffalo mozzarella(imported)/tomato/fresh basil salad and toasted bread slices with olive spread.  A bottle of wine was all that was needed to make this a meal to remember. Definitely a keeper.

This was really good!  I pounded the chicken thin, marinaded it with balsamic vinegar and garlic powder for about 10 minutes before dredging it in the flour.  I only used 3 cloves of garlic, but I pressed them through a garlic press first.  I only used 1/8 Cup of the vinegar at first, but after I removed the chicken, I put more into the pan.  I used 1 cup of chicken broth and omitted the bay leaf.  Served it over polenta...mmm mmm good!

This was an incredible dish! I, too, am tired of cream soup chicken recipes and was looking for a fresher tasting, and less fatty, recipe. I followed the suggestion of some other reviewers to cut down on the vinegar, but later wished I'd used the full 1/4 cup -- I enjoyed the tanginess and thought it could have been a bit more so.  Didn't have fresh mushrooms, so used canned, and kept thinking how much better the dish would have been with fresh mushrooms. As others have said, there's not quite enough sauce. I ended up using the whole can of chicken broth at the end when cooking down the sauce, and would have even liked a bit more sauce. The sauce was a wonderful marriage of tangy and savory, and was perfect on the chicken, and on the brown rice I made as a side dish.

I made this last night and found it very easy to make and delicious.  I added
a bit of spice to season the chicken before browning it.  Garlic powder and a very
small amount of Italian seasoning.

Followed the recipe exactly except I used 3 chicken breasts and added a little cornstarch at the end to thicken the sauce. Very good and I will make again!

I've never been a fan of chicken breasts preferring the thighs, but this recipe has made me a convert. The chicken was perfectly seasoned,  very moist, and came together so quickly that I was able to cook before work.

Per other comments, I left out the "dredge in flour" step (one less dirty dish!).  The recipe is very tart, so if you like a mellower flavor, cut back the balsamic vinegar for sure.  I ended up adding cornstarch to thicken the sauce since I didn't have time to reduce it, and it was delicious and just the right consistency. Will definitely make again, but with a little less balsamic.

Ok so I read all the reviews... Good for the most part, I followed the recipe to a tee.  I am a foodie so I was prepared to love it too...let me just say, it's pretty good, but that's because I like vinager.  If you are one that's not a huge fan of vinager, skip this recipe.  You can reduce the sauce till the cows come home... The vinegar will still be there to meet you.

Added 1 1/2 tsp corn starch to the sauce at the last phase. Would do a little less pepper than video. Browning the chicken well is important.  Will definite make again  and for dinner guests.

I used three chicken breasts that were slightly pounded. I also used 1 lb baby bella mushrooms sliced. Increased the chicken stock to 1 cup & the butter to 2 TBS.

It wouldn't be fair for me to rate this any less than five stars because I screwed up which caused the chicken to be dry, but i followed the recipe for the reduction/sauce to a tee and it ended up absolutely delicious. First reduction I've ever done, easy peasy. However, I did find that the reduction was done well before the 7 mins the recipe stated. (The chicken hadn't defrosted before I was ready to make this for dinner so I ended up having to poach it for a bit and then finished it per the recipe. Poached it a bit too long so I wound up over cooking it. Totally not the recipe's fault.)

This was quick, easy, and tasty.  My husband really like it.  I used sea salt and freshly ground pepper.  I just cooked 2 breasts and did not cut the sauce down.  If I was cooking 4 breasts, I would double everything for the sauce.

Hubby made per directions except used half the balsamic vinegar. It was still strong enough for balsamic flavor. We will try just cooking the chicken w/flour, salt & pepper until done. I like coating that isn't soggy. When the chicken is done we'll do the garlic & mushrooms & follow the rest of the directions. When all is cooked then we'll add the chicken without covering it so it doesn't get soggy.

Great recipe!!! Very simple and easy to follow. I substituted chicken tenders to make it more portion sized and I made no other adjustments other then leaving out the cloud which did in turn make it a more watery sauce. Fabulous recipe, thank you for sharing!!!

So so so good! I had a friend’s kids over for dinner in addition to my own, and all of the kids even loved this recipe! I didn’t put the sauce on top of my kids’ chicken, but they just aren’t fans of sauces in general. The other kids loved it sauce and all, and even told their mom I was the best cook ever! Highly recommend this recipe.

I made this with some slight variations (left out the garlic because I am allergic, added sherry to the sauce at the end of cooking). My son's words were something like "this is fantastic -- you have to make it again."

Followed the recipe exactly.  The mushroom cooking time at the end was not as long so watch it so that it doesn't reduce down and burn.

It turned out DELICIOUS. I doubled the sauce and added a tablespoon of corn starch to it to thicken up and let it cook about three minutes. I had leftover pasta and I spooned the delicious sauce over the pasta too.  My hubby really liked it and so did I.

My second time cooking ever! We loved this. Although next time I’d probably exclude the butter. I also added oregano and just a teaspoon of cornstarch to make the sauce thicker. Served it with steamed sweet potatoes to my mother and my boyfriend. Will definitely be cooking this again. Loved it.

My husband and I LOVED this. It was honestly restaurant quality. We only had 2 chicken breasts but used the same amount of other  ingredients. I would double the sauce next time to pour over the pasta (we used spaghetti instead of potatoes...yum!) Didn't flour the chicken breasts but added a sprinkle of flour while the chicken was cooking and the sauce was beautiful. Can't wait to make this for friends. A new favourite!

This is one of the recipes  I make for company.  I also have made this with beef.  I used good quality balsamic vinegar which I think really makes the dish.  Your guests will be impressed when you serve this but it is really easy to make.

This is delicious but only if you really like balsamic vinegar.  I only made one change and that was in the order of ingredients.  I didn't dredge the chicken.  Instead I added 2 T of flour to the mushrooms when I sautéd them so it would act as a thickener to the sauce.  Perfection!

This was super easy and very tasty. It will certainly become a weeknight staple. Only changes I made was to increase the amount of gravy and I did not have whole garlic cloves so I used minced.  I dont remember who posted this recipe, but my family and my tummy thank you!!!!

Simply delicious! Thank you for the recipe and thank you for the ones who suggested to cut the balsamic vinegar (I put only half) and I found it really pleasant. Also, I have to say that I left the flour part, and thickened the sauce with 1 Tb.  cornstarch at the end of the process.
I'll so be making this again!

Delicious and sooo easy to make! I like foods with strong flavors like this one. Before I browned the chicken, I sauted onion and garlic in the pan. I served it with roasted potatoes.

The flavor was good although the chicken breasts seemed a tad dry. I'll likely use thighs or tenderloins next time.

One of my favorite recipes ever!! The sauce was a little thin at the end so I added a little of the flour from the original step to make it thicker. The flavors are tremendous.

This was delicious but I did make a couple changes/additions.  First change was after I did the flour breading, I put it in the refrigerator for a little bit to let firm up.  The breasts I had were double the normal size so I browned them for double the time on each side.  I think the key to making the coating not gummy is to make sure your heat is high enough.  I added some onions and carmelized them along with the mushrooms.  Now, everyone said the amount of balsamic was too much but I actually ended up adding a little more.  I let the breasts braise for 20 minutes instead of 10 and cooked the sauce down for longer too.  Even still, I really don't think this was too far off of the original recipe and  I WILL make it again!

Omitted the bay leaf because I didn't have any in my kitchen, and added another half tablespoon of butter at the end. Everything else was just as in the recipe, and the final product was AWESOME. Amazing aroma in the house, and tastes just as well too! New favorite.

This was very good. I did make a few minor changes. Instead of thyme and a bay leaf,  I used Italian seasonings and parsley. I also added sauteed sweet onions and red bell pepper. After I browned the chicken, I removed it from the pan then sauteed the mushrooms, onions and bell pepper. Then I put the balsamic vinegar in with chicken broth and put the chicken back I  the pot. Simmered for 10 minutes uncovered and voila. Next time I will double the sauce because it does cook out while thickening. I served it with curly pasta (I forget the exact name).

This was an easy, fast and delicious recipe. I did read many of the reviews and followed some great suggestions. 1. I did not coat the chicken in flour as many reviewers said it was not necessary and I have to agree with them. The chicken still came out tender and moist. 2. At least half of the reviews I read suggested using less balsamic vinegar. One reviewer used heavy cream to tone down the tartness of the vinegar and a few other reviewers followed suit and they loved how the recipe turned out. I made 2 batches. I added 2 tablespoons of heavy cream to the first batch to tone down the tartness of the vinegar. It did make a difference and it still came out pretty scrumptious. The second batch of chicken I made was without the heavy cream and just the 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar as indicated in the recipe.That too came out really delicious, succulent and well, not bland. 3. Also, I used chicken stock instead of broth. This really can make a difference in any recipe. It adds a richness and just takes a dish to that next level. Great recipe and thanks for sharing! Thank you to all the reviewers out there! Your comments are always appreciated by those of us who love too cook!

I can't eat mushrooms so I substituted with thick sliced japanese eggplants for texture. Also added a little miso to the sauce to add the umami touch the mushrooms would have added. It turned out great!

We liked this recipe very much.  I cooked brown rice separately, but added the leftover rice to the two left over breasts for our next meal.  I uused minced Garlic in olive oil, which I always have on hand.  I use Bella mushrooms.

This was an excellent recipe.  I did add heavy whipping cream which added richness to the sauce.

I will make this recipe again.

Love the recipe, i have made a few changes  i par steamed 
Carrots , added them with the mushrooms,  also a dash of Worcester sauce, and then a parsley garnish

Try putting the chicken over rice instead of pasta.

Pretty good recipe. My best suggestion would be to have all your prepping done before starting to cook. Things go pretty fast. I served mine over a bed of rice.

Maybe it was our taste buds but this wasn't for us even though it had a few of my favorite ingredients.  Followed to a T but I would omit the flour. It is unnecessary and did not help to thicken the sauce. If you want enough sauce to go over pasta double the liquids and increase garlic.
I wouldn't make again and I wouldn't recommend.

We made this recipe without the flour, like other reviews suggested.  And the balsamic vinegar that I had was a sun dried tomato vinaigrette.  It tastes amazing!

This was such a hit with my husband and me and healthy! Makes a great mid-week dish and would be great to impress company too. I made it just as described and it came out great. The only thing I ran into was that my 4 chicken breast were huge and my pan wasn't big enough to make them all at the same time. I had to reserve some broth and vinegar to cook the rest. Next time, I would use smaller breasts or double the ingredients to accommodate a second batch.  Oh, and I used already seasoned pan searing flour. So easy.

This was a good dish and my wife loved it. After reading some of the reviews, I made a few changes to enhance the flavors. I used 2  bone in chicken breast halves  & cut them in half. I took the skin off & seasoned thyme, salt, and pepper. I thinly sliced the garlic cloves, used cremini & bottom mushrooms. I also added 1 tbsp. of dried shallots. I had some raspberry balsamic vinegar reduction in the frig so I used that instead of regular balsamic. Because the breast contained the bone, I cooked for 15 min. instead of 10 with the  mushrooms and broth with a pinch of cayenne pepper. I was tempted to reduce the vinegar by a 1/4 cup and make up the
difference with white wine to reduce the sweetness.

I make this a lot except I add some rice vinegar,  4 chopped garlic cloves and eliminate the flour. I also use white (or golden) balsamic vinegar instead of the regular brown type. With my little additions it's 5 stars but as is written it's 4 stars which is good too :)

Quite good and very easy.  Agree to not use the flour.  Also, will add some Dijon mustard at the end to give a little more depth to the mushroom sauce the next time.

I didn't have a bay leaf & I did omit the flour, but added some corn starch to the juices at the end to thicken it up as I almost doubled the chicken stock, oops.  I was a bit distracted so I'm not positive about my cooking times being right on, but it was a smidge dry, however we are talking boneless skinless chicken breasts here & aren't they almost always dry?  Anyway, it was a quick & easy dinner for us, served with green beans, carrots & roasted potatoes.  My husband likes to tell us what he'd pay for the meal if we were in a restaurant & he placed this one at 26.99.  (I wouldn't pay more than 17.99 personally.) But it went over well with both my kids, who love mushrooms, and my resident food critic.

So good! I am not the best cook, but it turned out great on my first try! 
I only had drumsticks with me, so I used them. Not a good idea because the sauce kept falling off. All this to say, stick to the recipe. :)

This was very very good. Quick and simple but very satisfying. Served with salad and was really happy with the meal. The spousal unit inhaled it.

Like many of the others, I skipped the flour and sautéed my slightly pounded chicken breasts.  Delicious vinegar and garlic flavor and even better the next day after sitting in the sauce.

This  is a nice, simple recipe.  I made it with dried shiitake mushrooms which I soaked, then sliced like matchsticks.  I used the soaking "broth" instead of the chicken broth.  After tasting the almost-finished sauce, I added a small spoonful of sugar, to tone down the vinegar taste (I did use a good balsamic, but it just tasted strong, even with reducing the measure).  Then, per another reviewer's suggestion, I added a small spoonful of a spicy mustard.   Served over brown rice; husband liked it.  Thanks for posting.

I'm quite surprised that I was disappointed with this recipe.  When I read it, I just knew that I would love it.   We love the flavor of balsamic vinegar and use a better quality balsamic  often.  I basically followed the recipe as-is with some very minor changes.  I had two pretty large skinless breasts.  Rather than pound them out as some others suggested, I cut them in two horizontally making 4 pieces.  I doubled the sauce at the suggestion of other reviewers.   I left off the dredging flour since it seemed that a good number of reviewers found it better without. 

From there, followed exactly and wound up with a sweet but very vinegary sauce.   I had seen that others had halved the balsamic, but I figured that they must be non-balsamic lovers.  Served it with angel hair and sauteed spinach. 

Well, next time, I'm going to try halving the balsamic. I did decide to save out about half of the sauce (with two of the halved breast halves) and tried adding a good glug of heavy cream.   Eating as leftovers, the cream did cut a good bit of the acidity and was actually quite good.  Again, next time, I think that if I cut the balsamic in half, everything will be fine.   Thanks for the recipe...it's given me a good place to start!

I am a working widowed mother of a two year old picky eater.  I followed the original recipe.  It was not only quick and simple to make, but it tasted so good that even my little one could find nothing to fuss about over it.   Mommy got a nice  adult styled meal for a change and her little angel at every bite too.  Definitely a keeper!

Browned the chicken, removed, then added all ingredients, heated up for the 10 minutes, then added the chicken back into the sauce to finish cooking the chicken. Fabulous!!

It was easy and good but not terribly flavorful. One of the critical comments said it was bitter. I think it is important to use a good quality balsamic vinegar. I used cranberry pear white balsamic and my husband asked what ingredient made it sweet. It was the vinegar. As some recommended, I did not use the flour but other than that, I followed the recipe.

I made this, but it was too Tangy with the vinegar so I added about a quarter cup of brown sugar and some Sherry and mixed it together with some flour to thicken it up a little bit it was good.

This was a really good recipe! I followed the directions exactly, except I was maybe a bit generous with the vinegar. I did double the sauce because it turns out that I don't have a pan big enough for 4 chicken breasts so I made it in batches of 2 breasts at a time. I didn't double the mushrooms though and maybe I should have. I bought pre sliced mushrooms, 8 oz of them. Also I don't think I reduced the sauce enough as it was super watery, so perhaps I would add some corn starch next time. Overall this was a really good recipe I wouldn't hesitate to make for guests!

The flavor of this dish is wonderful. As I use organic free range chicken, I only used 2 breasts as they are twice the size. When I make this again, I will double the ingredients for the sauce as it was so good, and not quite enough. Lovely dish.

Yum! Didn't have mushrooms so just skipped that all together.  Pounded the chicken  to evenly cook (my big pan only fit 3 pounded breasts.) Did not dredge with flour. Used at least  1 cup of stock,  in the final two minutes with the sauce I added a few handfuls of fresh spinach.  Served over buttered fettuccine, topped with halved cherry tomatoes. My kids loved it too.

I substituted the chicken broth for 3/4 of scan of cream of mushroom soup and 1/4 cup water and left out the mushrooms. This came out unbelievable. I also added s space of fig balsamic in addition to the regular to give a little sweetness.

The only thing I changed in this recipe was omitting the dredge on the chicken.  I don't usually like the texture of dredged chicken when it's sitting in a liquid.  I did add a bit of flour to the sauce in the pan to thicken the sauce just a bit.  Really delicious!

Good! and pretty quick & easy. Sauce reduction is nice  - make twice the sauce it calls for because it's good over noodles or mashed potatoes and reduces down quickly even with the lid on. I had to add more liquid after the chicken was done to turn the paste back into sauce. Chicken got a bit overcooked - take it out of the pan when it hits 160oF and tent under foil. Consider brining it for 30 minutes to retain moisture.

Very yummy - made it exactly as recipe says. Very tasty, I would be careful not to just eyeball the vinegar amount, as the recipe calls for what I would say is the max amount you can put in without making it too much. We will be enjoying this recipe again and again I am sure.

I read a lot of the reviews prior to making this. I was worried would be too vinegary tasting but it turned out great and savory. I followed most of the recipe with a few tweaks based on my own family's preferences and notes from reviewers.



A few things I did take note of was that lots of reviewers skipped the flouring part. I was tempted but decided to just lightly sprinkle the flour on the chicken to crisp it some during the frying process. The rest of the flour I reserved for later so I wouldn't end up with slimey chicken. 

I also noted one reviewer said she went for a higher end balsamic vinegar. I decided to do the same. I've never worked with balsamic vinegar before but my end result wasn't vinegary. I didn't have the bite that everyone was talking about. I will say I will continue to do the same for this recipe since just a few extra dollars results on a large bottle. I also put in 1/2 tsp of mustard powder to give it a different dimension of flavor.

With the chicken broth, I increased it to 1.25 cups instead for more sauce and to tone down any potential vinegary taste. When it was done, I poured an additional 1/4 cup of broth in a small bowl to mix with the remaining flour. Once that mixture was mixed smooth, I slowly poured it into the sauce stirring the whole time. It thickened the sauce up to just the right consistency. 




The end result was a very smooth sauce that was mild and savory all at once. I paired mine with linguine noodles and a salad (green leaf

This was a pretty good recipe. I made it twice. However I have some feedback. I only needed to use two chicken breasts cut in half lengthwise. This allowed the flavors to better seep into the chicken. I also added more salt and pepper to the flour, as well as more balsamic vinegar to the sauce. 

I am fond of bold flavors so of course it may not be for everyone. Happy cooking!

This is a great quick recipe, I used buckwheat noodles to serve over the chicken. I did not change the ingredients at all, just a little less balsamic vinegar. The sauce was great,  butter is always a finishing touch.

Loved this dish ! For me though I changed only a few things. Need to cook with what I had. LEFTOVER CHICKEN ! ?? I cut up chunks off a whole roaster I had made 2 days ago.  (This recipe) I used ALL the ingredients Except for mushrooms because I didn't have those on hand. My complete dinner consisted of  roasted potatoes w/carrots, green beans & The Chicken w/vinaigrette  . Topped off warm dinner roll.  This recipe for the chicken/vinaigrette is So Delicious  You'll want to make sure you dab until your plate is Dry !!!

I made this recipe "as is" the first time and it was amazing. I've made it several times since and started to add a bit more balsamic vinegar and chicken broth because I like a lot of sauce. 

I also let the chicken cook longer before adding the garlic and mushrooms so that it's crispier on the outside.

I made this recipe last night and while it was cooking I got a little scared... All I could smell was vinegar! I thought the sauce seemed to be a little too thin, so I added a bit of cornstarch, which helped. After serving it over a bed of rice... it was great! My husband said it reminded him of something he would have at Olive Garden. I did add about a tsp of onion powder and a tsp of garlic powder to the mix of liquid and spice before adding it to the pan. Would have been 5 star if not for the potent smell of vinegar that's  still lingering in my kitchen... but I don't know if that's the recipes fault!

My daughter said it was the best meal I EVER made. Wow. We both thought there should be much more sauce for this dish. Will double sauce ingredients in the future. I, as many other's, did not use flour in this recipe but did add corn starch at the end to thicken a bit.

The sauce was very sweet--too sweet in my opinion.  I used a quality balsamic vinegar (the $25-type, not the $200-type). The dish was OK, but I don't think I'll make it again.  FYI - If you decide to try this dish, I recommend doubling the sauce recipe in order to make "enough" to spoon over the four chicken breasts.

Love love love. Used Progresso Tuscany GF chicken broth and Namaste GF baking mix to make this recipe gluten allergy friendly. Impressed my dinner party of 8 with how moist and yummy the chicken was. Very easy, little mess, instant favorite!

Made this for dinner tonight.  Even my picky eaters enjoyed it.  Cut back n the vinegar by half if it's not your thing, but otherwise this was a great family dinner!!  Adding it to the rotation!

I thought this chicken had a very good flavor. The best part was the mushroom topping. I might have cooked the sauce at the end a bit too long as it turned out very think, but I really loved how it turned out and would do that again.

I prepared this as written. It was very good. Next time I will almost double the mushrooms, we like them and they do cook down. Served with rice but next time I'll make linguine.

This was really tasty and super simple to make. Like many others, I pounded the breast thin (but not super thin) and didn't bother with the flour. I thickened the sauce at the end with a little cornstarch. I served it with green beans and roasted potatoes and drizzled the sauce down over all.

I followed the recipe exactly including the flour and used the amount of chicken, garlic, mushrooms to suit my appetite and taste. I halved the sauce ingredients. I like anything vinegar, but am not terribly keen on balsamic, as for me it is too sweet. However I always have a bottle in the larder and so used it. I enjoyed it, but it was just on the verge of being too sweet and therefore inedible.  It is a simple recipe and quite pleasant, but next time I will either use other vinegar, or mix balsamic with other vinegar.

This recipe was just okay for me. It seemed to be lacking some flavor and the balsamic was a little bitter. My husband liked it, but I don't think I'd make it again anytime soon.

My 13 year old daughter made this for dinner tonight.....it was absolutely delicious! You must try this one. We didn't have the mushrooms this time so I can't wait to try it again with them. This will definitely be an addition to our family favorites list. Flavor was wonderful....especially if you use good quality balsamic vinegar :)

I made it just as written. I used butter, not margarine. Next time I would use unsalted butter instead. And I think I'd leave salt out of the seasoning part too, the chicken bullion has enough.

Highly addictive. I double (or triple) the sauce and serve it over spinach noodles. Tonight I'll likely just use wheat noodles as that's all I have, but regardless, I know I will have very little in the way of leftovers. It's a hit every time I make it!

I was really looking forward to making this recipe based on all the great reviews but I didn't think it was too great. I did not use the flour and agree with other reviews- the amount of balsamic vinegar is definitely too strong.

Not bad. I would skip the flour next time. It did not add anything to the texture of the chicken and the sauce could be thickened other ways.

As written I give this 4.5 stars.  I wanted to try it exactly as shown first.  There were suggested changes that really should be done.  First, flouring the chicken is out.  It definately made the finished product kinda mushy.  I will use a white balsamic next time, as suggested because the color is a little off-putting.  

You will know when the balsamic has reduced.  Do not keep cooking at this point or the sauce becomes a little goopy.  I kept cooking because the time was not done.  

The sauce was wonderful and I will actually triple it the next time.  This cooked up fast and was super yummy.  I served it over rice pilaf.

Would give 5 stars except the flour coating didn't work well. Next time I will skip it.

Really good flavor and very easy to make. I agree with other reviews that the flour seemed to only create a slimy film on the surface of the chicken. I did use thin sliced breasts - which may have made it worse... Next time I'll skip the flour and see if it turns out better.

This made a nice chicken, not dry and quite tasty.  The mushroom sauce was pretty good, though next time I may thicken it a little with some cornstarch. Also didn't need quite as many mushrooms.

This was delicious and SO easy! I took the advice of other users and omitted the flour. I did add a touch of paprika while the chicken was simmering as well as some half-and-half to the sauce to cut the vinegar. We had it over rice with asparagus-- incredible!

Tried this for dinner tonight and cooked exactly as directed, except for adding some cornstarch to thicken. Very disappointed, probably the least flavorful recipe I have cooked from allrecipes.  Will not be cooking again.

This was excellent! I followed the suggestions of others and skipped the flour and instead added a little cornstarch at the end. Other than that I followed the recipe. Definitely will make again!!

This recipe is delicious!  I always order Balsamic Chicken at a local Italien restaurant and have tried to find something similar - and this is IT!  Will add this to my regular recipe rotation for sure.

This recipe had an excellent flavor and is elegant and easy enough to serve for company. I did change a few things. First, I sliced the chicken breasts into strips. They absorbed more of the flavor as they were simmering. At the end, I did add 4T of heavy cream to the sauce. Loved it! Served with steamed broccoli. There is so much flavor to the chicken that I thought a simpple veggie that didn't compete with it would work the best. This is a keeper!

I've made this recipe many many times. Its my go-to recipe when I want a savory chicken pasta dinner without the red sauce. I think the balsamic reduction is perfect. Using a good balsamic vinegar doesn't hurt either. Sometimes I throw a splash of red wine in there too add to the richness. I tend to skip the dredging the chicken in flour step and I still think it comes out delish! LOVE this recipe. Thanks!!!

Great recipe & super easy, yet tastes like it's complicated.  I have to adjust this due to local ingredients & use tinned mushroom pieces.  I also cut the chicken breasts into smaller pieces & now leave out the flour step.  I have tried with the butter & w/o and it's fine without (saves calories).  We like this dish on pasta. I have noted that the taste varies with different brands of balsamic, but that is not the fault of the recipe.

This was a solid recipe. I personally would have added even more mushrooms and perhaps more liquid to result in a bit more sauce, but that's a matter of personal taste. Also, take care not to let the sauce burn. I think it could easily do that on medium high heat. I would turn it down to medium low heat when reducing this sauce. It was tasty, and pretty, and we will make it again!

This recipe is delicious and I've made it several times now.  Definitely the kind of dish that gets raves at a dinner party.  I think there needs to be more empasis in the original recipe on how to make the sauce at the end thick and creamy, savoury -- so I deviate from the recipe a bit there, similar to a restaurant favourite of mine.  It comes a close second!

I really love this recipe, it's a staple in our house. I changed a few things to suit my tastes, hence the four star instead of 5 star rating. I don't bother with the flour, because I find it unnecessary. I also use a whole can of chicken broth, because the amount it gives it not a whole can and that's annoying. I also add a can of tomatoes, as well as more herbs like fresh rosemary. Other than that, this dish is absolutely delicious! I serve with with a veggie side and mashed potatoes to soak up more of the awesome liquid.

I really wanted to like this recipe.  I absolutely love Balsamic Vinegard and I'm a chicken fanatic.  Unfortunately the simplicity of the recipe was also its downfall.  There was no depth of flavor at all. It is chicken breast cooked in Balsamic...I couldn't even get the garlic flavor.    I'll probably try and make it again and use some suggestions in the reviews section to see if I can pull out more flavor, but this recipe as written was too bland for me.  Sorry

I messed this up and added too much balsamic and it was still yummy! My three year old gobbled it up, and I can barely get him to eat anything. That's saying something right there! I will be making this again for sure!

I made this tonight for dinner for the first time following the directions. The only change I made was serving the chicken with four cheese mashed potatoes and italian green beans. The sauce was thin, as I understand it is to be served over pasta. However, I think the next I make it.. I may try a different variation with the sauce using onions instead of garlic cloves, garlic powder, and combining butter with onions and mushrooms in pan to reduce first, then adding chicken as directions list; along with more flour to thicken sauce. Any suggestions with this idea?

This was very good but next time I would cut the chicken in stir fry pieces, add chopped red/green peppers and onions as for stir fry and add to mushrooms then to sauce as per recipe. Serve over linguine or angel hair pasta.

btwn 4-5 stars. I didn't flour the chicken, used tenders and added a touch of flour at the end of reducing the broth. Very simple and savory recipe.  Served with the strawberry feta salad and parsleyed new potatoes. Company worth!

Absolutely delicious as written! I used fresh chicken tenders and the timing was perfect. I did add a little flour left over from dredging to thicken the sauce a bit but not much. The reduction is just elegant. And it's easy! I served it with left over scalloped potatoes and fresh green beans. One of the best recipes on this site so far. I will certainly make again probably for company.

VERY GOOD!  I didn't have any chicken broth, so I just used water and it still turned out tasty! I served the chicken over linguine noodles. Great recipe!

Good flavor, but not enough sauce.  Also the cooking times are incorrect unless you are using chicken breast tenders.

Just made this tonight. It was very good. I took the advice of several reviewers and did not dredge the chicken in flour because of the time that it's covered during cooking. I didn't use enough mushrooms though. I bought an  8 oz. package of sliced mushrooms and thought it would be plenty - I was wrong! Next time I'll get at least a pound! Oh, I also used 1/4 teaspoon Old Bay seasoning and left out the bay leaf (I forgot that I didn't have any). Worked out great! Thank you for this recipe.

Very good base recipe. I omitted the thyme and used fresh basil instead. I also added white wine, onions and artichoke hearts. 3 days later my bf is still thanking me for dinner!

What? Yum! This was an awesome meal. Next time I will flatten/tenderize chicken just a little before cooking and double my sauce, which is fantastic. I used Portabello Mushrooms and if you like mushrooms, you better use more because they're really good! Great Job Colleenlora!!!

Following other reviews, I skipped the flour but added some cornstarch to the final sauce to thicken it slightly.  I followed the other instructions completely. This tasted pretty good to me but my husband and kids just thought it was ok.  We all agreed it seemed to be missing some depth that I couldn't quite place.  Perhaps some red wine as others suggested?  It was definitely tender chicken and seems to have good potential, but I'll have to play around with it for next time.

I just made the balsamic vinegar and garlic chicken breasts and they are really good!  I didn't have any fresh mushrooms on hand, so I substituted cream of mushroom soup and it was really yummy!  I will definitely make this again.  Two thumbs up!

I made this exactly as specified but upon tasting the ending sauce found it too vinegary and ended up adding 1/3 cup cream to take the edge off and create more sauce. Delicious!

This was very good!  Although I would have added in the recipe to purchase smaller size chicken breasts or use chicken breast halves.  Maybe I interpreted it wrong.  Oh, and silce your mushrooms (the recipe did say that) I made the mistake of roughly chopping and it would have been better to slice so the taste could be better experienced with the larger mushroom portions.

Delicious!!!  This is a great twist on chicken.  Best with portabella mushrooms.  I added a little italian seasoning with the thyme to taste.  I didn't have a bay leaf on hand and it was still great.  Good with fresh green beans cooked in olive oil and balsamic vinager and roasted red potatotes - great family dinner!  My 2 and 3 year olds even ate every bite!

This is a quick and easy recipe.  I added onion and cut the chicken breasts into bite sized pieces and omitted the butter.  It was delicious!  I will be making this again.  I served it on a bed of brown basmati rice, and peas as a side vegetable.  This is a simple family recipe, and tasty enough to serve to company.

What a fantastic recipe! The chicken was tender and so flavourful. The mushrooms really hold that balsamic flavour as well. I left out the flour after reading some of the reviews, but that was the only change I made and it turned out perfectly. I'll definitely be cooking this again.

I loved this dish and it is a family favorite.  The chicken was so moist. I like to make it and put it over linguini noodles.  Because my family likes a  more sauce over our noodles,  I doubled the vinegar, broth, and butter.  I also added additional mushrooms, I think they soak up the most flavor. Overall amazing!

Pounded out the chicken breast, seasoned w/salt and peper, as well as seasoning the flour. After browning the chicken removed it from the pan, then added in chopped onion, garlic and mushrooms. Followed the recipe as far as amounts of balsamic and broth, but in addition added 1/2 cup white wine. simmered sauce for about 10 minutes, then added chicken back in, cooked for additional 15 minutes along with rosemary, a bit more salt and bay leaf, didn't swirl in the butter at the end. Served with angel hair and roasted broccoli, Very good, the whole family enjoyed!

pretty good. kind of a strong balasmic taste, just a lil different for me i guess. make sure your simmering that sauce on low after you take out the chicken, i cooked the sauce right out by the time 7 minutes was up so i added more. i served it with mashed taters and mixed cheese vegis!

This was a very tasty recipe because I love balsamic vinegar and garlic.  I only gave it 3 stars because my guests did not say too much when they were eating it....and I believe the chicken breast should have been 'thinner' so next time I'll pound the chicken....maybe it would have been tender and easier to slice if the chicken was pounded.

This is an awesome recipe! I only used 1/8 cup of balsamic and 1 full cup of chicken broth because I wanted to cut down on the tanginess of the vinegar. It was great!

I thought this was a fantastic meal.  I made it with brown rice and baked asparagus.  It was fantastic.  Very similar to a marsala but much lighter.

i am a very experienced cook and due to the high amount of people raving about this recipe i figured i would give it a go. i followed it exactly as others had advised and it was probably on my top 5 list of UGLIEST most COLORLESS dishes. it was overly salty and was not at all worth the mess/dishes it left to be washed, the amount of time you spend mincing garlic, or the HUGE sodium intake. the only thing decent i have to say about it is that the chicken was very moist and i also made fettuccine noodles to rest the chicken upon. still a salty dinner not worth the time.

Next time I will use 1/2 the amount of oil, as it turned out to be very greasy.  Otherwise the taste was incredible!

This was a tasty and easy dish to prepare. My husband okayed it, too. I made it without the mushrooms (I didn't have any), so I didn't do the sauce preparation at the end of the directions. The chicken seemed to have enough sauce even so. I served it with spinach linguini and peas.

This was excellent!! As others mentioned, I also had to double the sauce.  I will make this again and use portabellas, less vinegar just so it won't be so tart. This one is a keeper!!  Thanks!!

I really don't know what all the fuss was about with this recipe.  For us, it was just OK - nothing to "wow" about.  Gave it three stars because there is no 2.5.

This is easy, quick, and absolutely delicious. The chicken was moist and flavorful, and I've been making the sauce for other dishes. Five stars, will definitely make again.

This is such an easy recipe... but so delicious. I followed the recipe exactly, except omitted the bay leaf because I didn't have any in the house. Also, I like my sauce to be just a little thicker, so i added a little extra flour and allowed to cook for an extra 5-10 min until the sauce coated the back of a spoon. Served with mashed potatos. Everyone loved it.

I tried this recipe last night and it was a HIT! I didn't have anymore thyme so used dried parsley instead and it was delicious! I didn't see a need in adding the butter and no one noticed anything missing. Quick, easy and super duper yummy!

This is simply FANTASTIC! I have made this over five times already, which means it's a keeper. I sauteed the chicken with minced onion and fried garlic, then added the chicken broth and balsamic vinegar. Here's my variations to the sauce: I added about 2 cups of fresh diced tomatoes (to thicken and enhance the flavor), and about 1 cup of diced mango (it adds a really nice and sweet flavor to the sauce). I set the chicken aside, and simmered the sauce for about 20 mins before tossing the chicken back in. The result is a very tangy and sweet balsamic vinegar chicken dish!!!

Oh MY GOODNESS!  This was sooo good!  I used bone in chicken, and after pan fryng it and making the sauce, I put it in the oven for 45 min.  I then had time to clean up and make the potato and veggies.  WOW- the sauce and mushrooms were awesome!  I used the whole can of broth and added more tyme.  I am keeping this one for when company comes over! PERFECT for company!

This will be my new "company dish" from now on.  Quick, inexpensive, and oh so good!  For the cooks commenting on the vinegar being too strong . . . pay attention to the quality of the balsamic you buy.  I've found that's one ingredient you really can't skimp on.  Buy the best you can afford.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I don't like mushrooms, so I left those out. I also followed the advice of some other reviewers and left out the flour dredging part, which didn't seem necessary. With those revisions it was absolutely delicious over rice!!

Absolutely delicious! This is something that I will cook for company because it's sure to impress. The only thing I excluded was garlic- simply because I'm not a fan- otherwise I followed the recipe. Yum!

A great chicken breast recipe.  I doubled the sauce portion and added a little cabernet to add some richness.  This recipe would be good with any cut of chicken.

Very good and super easy! The first time I made it I followed exactly and it was very good, but I'm going to try without the flour, since it just added an extra step and really didn't do much. I accidentally reduced the sauce too much the first time and had nothing but it was still good, so this time I will be more careful. Excellent!

All in all this was very good. Not spectacular, but very good. I used onions instead of mushrooms just because that is all I had on hand.  I left the vinegar, chicken broth ratio alone and thought it was great as written. No need to reduce the vinegar as some have said. Not at all vinegary. I did flour the chicken as the recipe stated which eliminated the need to thicken with flour or cornstarch as others did. Stick to the recipe as written. It needs no adjusting. I served this over brown rice.

Great chicken dinner.  It was ready in no time.  I used whole fresh baby button mushrooms with the stems instead of the larger ones sliced.  I also served it with baby white steamed potatoes skins on  with butter and rosemary.

I'm on the fence for this recipe. I was attracted to this because I love Balsamic Vinegar - I could practically bathe in it. But I was rather disappointed at how sweet it became with the garlic. I was expecting something savory and ended up adding plenty of fresh Parmesan to the sauce to give it a little more salt and substance.  Other than the sweetness, I loved this recipe. Very user friendly, it still tastes great for left overs (if you can manage to save any). I too forewent the flour on the chicken. I also fried another clove of garlic on the side for garlic-crisps which add a nice touch I think, as well as a welcomed crunch.

This was FANTASTIC!!!! My whole family loved it. I made it exactly as stated. The only negative was I made it with pasta and I think rice would have been better.  This is going into regular rotation. So easy too!

This was a hit with my husband! After a couple bites he said, "Wow this is really good, I'd pay $15.99 for this dish at a restaurant!" The only thing I'd change is that I served it with Angel Hair Pasta and it may be better with fettucini or linguini, I also put corn starch in the sauce to thicken but put a little too much and the sauce turned out like gravy. But my mistakes do not effect the recipe, this was very good!

Followed the recipe to the tee, and chicken and mushrooms both burned. I will try modifying it in the future.

i pounded the chicken breasts before cooking because they tend to be more tender that way. i used a small can of sliced mushrooms instead of fresh mushrooms and though not stated i did a rough chop of the garlic. Served with white rice and french style green beans. Very classic dish. Tender and tasty- the best part is that it's quick

This was a tad bit bland for my boyfriend and I.  The balsamic flavor was strong, but the chicken was soggy and it didn't hold to the meat, so it was kind of soupy.

This dish had some good flavors and was extremely easy to prepare, however the balsamic taste was far to overpowering..and I love vinegar! I would suggest using 1/8 cup instead of 1/4 cup, or upping the chicken broth so the vinegar doesn't overwhelm the dish.

This recipe blew me away!  The only thing I will do differently next time is add an extra 1/2 cup of broth.  (I would've liked a bit more sauce.)  My husband fully enjoyed this dish and mentioned it again the next day.  Can't wait to make it again.  I paired this with Zucchini Noodles that you can find on this site and it was a great pairing.

Very good!  I did not flour the chicken, as suggested by others, and I added minced onions. When it came to reducing the sauce I added wondra flour to help thicken(I figured that was the reason for the flour in the first place)  I like balsamic vinegar but my husband does not really care for it, so it was not his favorite.  We both agreed that it seemed like a dish we would find at our favorite italian restaurant.  Next time I think I will use less vinegar, I will make again for sure.

Good basic recipe.  I omitted dredging the chicken in flour as other reviews suggested.  It seems to get soggy.  I also used onions instead of mushrooms only because my kids don't eat them.  I also doubled the sauce ingredients and served over angel hair spaghetti, which I added to the pan after cooking to absorb some of the sauce.  Quick and easy.

I made this without mushrooms, but otherwise followed the recipe and it was so delicious!  I doubled the sauce and dipped each bite!  Next time I will add the garlic later because it nearly burned before I could get the broth in the pot (and didn't get to brown the other side of the chicken because of it).

This was good, but I'm not as ecstatic as some other reviewers. I used baby bella mushrooms, which were great. I fear the chicken I used (or my cooking technique) was the reason for the star-deduction (chicken ended up being tough and dry).

Loved it!  I made extra and had no left overs, everyone was so pleased with the chicken, served with mashed potatos rather then noodles was a huge success also.

This was really a nice recipe. I felt like the chicken needed a little more flavor.  NExt time will marinate the chicken in the sauce for a while before cooking. I also did'nt feel that the flour added anything to the dish, I will leave it out next time. :)

This was excellent! I gathered several tips from other users - threw it all together - and poof! Thanks for a great recipe - it added interest to a weekly meal that may have otherwise been rather boring.

This is a great go to recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and it was wonderful. I served the chicken with a side of rice. I will make again and again.

I made this dish last night for my family and boyfriend, everybody loved it! I used Portobello mushrooms and chicken tenderloin instead of breasts (2 tend. = 1 breast). I also left out the flour as other reviewers had suggested. It had a strong balsamic vinegar flavor, but I loved it so that was okay. It was easy for me (a beginner)  and tasted delicious! I will definitely be making this again!

Absolutely loved this dish.  I made this for a family dinner, so I doubled the ingredients.  The balsamic vinegar brings just the right amount of tanginess to the chicken & the sauce.  There was not a drop leftover!   Instead of doing pasta as a side, we made mashed potatoes with chives & a salad.  Will definitely be making this again!

Pretty good, but the balsamic was somewhat overpowering after several bites. Would be good to offset the vinegar flavor by having a bland or creamy side dish to serve with it, such as potatoes.

We have loved this recipe ever since we got it from Pierre Franey's 60-Minute Gourmet column in the NY Times 20 years ago or so. Franey had many, many tasty recipes we have used with guests to our lake cabin.

Fantastic recipe.  After reading a lot of the comments I skipped out on the flour and cut the balsamic vinegar in half and it was exceptional.  The only variation was I cooked a little pasta and tossed it in olive oil and black pepper and served the chicken on a small serving of pasta.

Delicious!!  Cooked a few less minutes on the final sauce.  I would leave out the flour.  Mushrooms are the best part.

I will preface with this - I am not a cook, but I desperately want to be because I love food.  That said, even for a novice, this recipe is amazing.  I would recommend making more sauce than the recipe calls for, but the taste was sublime and I think this is the first time my chicken hasn't tasted like rubber.  Delicious!

I made this last night and it was very good. Didn't flour the chkn because it browns so beautifully in EVOO. Added Wondra to sauce to thicken at end. A good basalmic vinegar has NO vinegar taste. It's one of those things where you get what you pay for. I increased the stock to a full cup & used 10 cloves of garlic like earlier posters. This would also be good with Marsala in place of the basalmic and a few capers too. Dry sherry or lemon juice would be worth a try also. Will experiment and report back. It's nice to find a simple, no-brainer recipe that is so tasty and so versatile. Thank you.

This is delicious! Excellent with the small portabello mushrooms and a little extra balsamic and broth. Sprinkle it all with a little parmesan and its perfect. I may omit the flour next time but it was still very tasty...

So so sorry - my husband & I found this to be a little too cloying (if that makes any sense).  Cooked exactly as directed - should never have used the flour, and with time given, my chicken was considerably overdone ... probably my fault, I should have checked it earlier.  Many thanks for recipe...

I enjoyed the tangy vinegar flavor.  I sprinkled the flour instead of dredging; added rosemary and red pepper flakes.

Excellent recipe.  Made it exactly according to the recipe except pounded the chicken a bit to make it flatter.  I kept the garlic whole  as the recipe didn't say to chop it, so I didn't.  Just didn't eat the garlic but took it out with the bay leaf.  Used good balsamic vinegar.  I think the quality of the vinegar can make a difference.  My husband gave this recipe a 10 out of 10.  Me too.

Made exactly as stated and it is delicious!  I did use white balsamic vinegar as i think it is less strong as the dark stuff.  Will make again.

Beautiful recipe.  I served this recipe at two separate dinner parties with pasta and it was a hit both times.  It' my new favorite chicken recipe.   I did not use flour though only because other comments recommended not to...I don't think that the flour was missed at all.  I just thickened the sauce.

This is the first time I have ever reviewed anything here.  In fact this recipe caused me to join.  When some said "restaurant quality" they weren't kidding. WOW!  When I cook this again I will not reduce the sauce as much to give more sauce over the noodles or I could just make more sauce.  :)  YUM!!!!    Thank you very much Colleen.

This is my first review. It was so good I just had to say something : ) I Followed some reviewer sugguestions: left out the flour and pounded the chicken breasts a little. I didn't have any broth handy so I used white cooking wine instead. Came out amazing : )    NOTE* By the time my chicken was done, I hardly had any liquid left maybe because I used wine instead of broth, so when adding the butter I splashed in a little more wine. I also returned the chicken to the pan and let it sit for a couple of minutes. YUM!

I made this for dinner tonight and it was very tasty. I took in consideration the other reviews and did not dredge the chicken in flour and just sauteed as is and it it came out great. My husband enjoyed, as well as my picky 2 1/2 year old.

So good! The only thing I'll do differently next time is to pound the chicken breasts a little before dredging and browning. Served this with the Honey Roasted Red Potatoes and it was out of this world!
edit 10.4.10 The next time I used a package of chicken tenders and it was even easier!

This was delightful! Omitting the flour is definitely a good idea. Portobello mushrooms work particularly well. Goes nicely with rice, pasta, red potatoes, or a vegetable medley, and looks deceptively haute cuisine on the platter. ^^

This was good - both my husband and I enjoyed it. My chicken took longer to brown than in the instructions though. And next time, I think I'd add extra thyme.

Maybe we didn't use high-quality-enough vinegar, but I was slightly disappointed. My family thought it was pretty good, but I wanted there to be another flavor, some sweetness, to balance out the pungency of the vinegar and garlic (six cloves is a lot for four servings).

My family like the unusual taste of the sauce.  If you are looking for a change to ordinary chicken, this might just be the recipe for you.

WONDERFUL!  The three things I did different was add a 1 1/2 teaspoons Johnny's Seasoning Salt  to the flour, used skinless boneless thighs and omitted the butter since there was enough fat from the thighs.  My husband and I loved it.  A keeper for sure!!  ENJOY!!!

Excellent recipe.  I do disagree with some of the other reviewers however---I did dredge the chicken in flour before cooking and thus I did not need to add any thickening agent and the chicken turned out wonderfully.  I also patted the chicken dry before dredging it.  I pounded the breasts first as well and also used 1 cup of chicken broth.  I served it with couscous.

I give this recipe five starts because my husband said, "This is a restaurant quality dish." I enjoyed it also, but I feel as if it were missing something. I'll definitely make again and perhaps add a little more herbs.

Thank you for such an awesome, tasty, and easy recipe.  I will be makng this again and again and again! Can't wait to cook it for company!

I can't tell you how many times I've made this recipe! When I cook it, friends, family and even pets come running because it really smells, looks, and tastes that good. Some modifications: I don't dredge the chicken in flour; I double the garlic; I make double the sauce (at least), I use more dried thyme because I'm addicted to the stuff. Thank you for this recipe!

This is my first review and it gets 5 stars!  This was a really tasty meal- chicken was moist and full of flavor.  I followed the recipe except I omitted the thyme and used a little less balsamic vinegar.  Served over brown rice with the "Easy Asparagus" recipe from this site.  Delicious!

Absolutely fantastic, professional level dish!!  I followed others' advice and didn't flour the chicken breasts.  The dish didn't need the flour.  It stands on its own.  Very easy, quick and wonderful.  An absolute keeper!!

Simple easy dish.  I used used Crimini and Button mushrooms, along w/vegatable broth.  We had big breast and they came out very tender.   Served over egg noodles.

I used two chicken breasts and the amount of liquid was perfect, so I might double it for the full recipe.  I thought this was a very good recipe.  I did not have any balsamic vinegar, so I used apple cider vinegar.  I would give this 5 stars but my husband gave it 5 so 4.5 it is!  By the way, I served it with Roasted Yams from this site (sooooo good) and Sesame Green Beans.

The first time, I didnt realize I was out of mushrooms, but this was just as good without them. My husband is 'sick of chicken' and he ate it all, even commenting that it was good and to keep the recipe. 
Second time I added the mushrooms; again he ate it all and wanted to be sure there would be some for lunch tomorrow!!!Thank you for sharing.

Did not care for. I skipped the flour and thickened the sauce w/cornstarch; otherwise I followed the recipe.  It came out like a bbq sauce that needed sugar. Hubby liked it. Says it was a little acidic but he'd eat it again.  I have been accused of not liking complex flavours - guilty as charged. Way too vinegary for me.

I love this recipe.   It is so simple and tastes like a dish served in a restaurant.  I omit the flour as recommended and I usaually double the sauce part of the recipe as it is so tasty I can't get enough of it.

This was good, but lacking something.  I foured the chicken breast and fried them in some olive oil on both side to brown, the added the garlic and also a tbs of tomato pastelet the paste brown for a minute before adding the vingar and broth and let this reduce a bit before adding the chicken in to finish cooking.  This took about 4 minutes and by then the sauce was a perfect consistency. The chicken came out great, I think if you pan sear the floured chicken first it seals in the juice and alsoprevents the floury taste some are refering to.

Easy and yummy.  I followed the other reviews and did not dredge in flour, did add a little cornstarch at the end.  My picky kids did not like but my husband and I loved it.  Will make again.

I made this recipe gluten free by using gluten free flour and ensuring the chicken broth was gluten free too.  It was really good!  I wish I had served it with potatoe instead of rice, as I found the sauce to be more of a gravy.  I will make it again, and I will serve it with potatoes.

This was very good. The chicken turned out nice and tender. I also left out the flour before a lot of reviewers seemed to think it was better that way. My sauce thickened up perfectly, but I found the balsamic flavour was a little too strong so I added a couple of tablespoons of light cream and I found that balanced it out nicely.

Excellent recipe. Very easy. I omitted the flour and used two pans for the 4 chicken breasts, adding garlic and mushrooms to each pan, and then consolidating into one pan after they were browned. A good move. The breasts browned beautifully and then all fit nicely into the pan with the broth/vinegar to simmer. Definitely has a vinegar kick, so if you're not a fan, this might not be the dish for you.

It was just okay for me.  I am hoping the leftovers taste better and plan to see what other tips were given in the other reviews.  I followed the recipe to the tee.  I did have to cook the chicken longer than given in the recipe.  It may be due to Colorado having a hight altitude.

I can't say enough great things about this recipe.  First off, I'm way more of a baker than a cook...and most of the dinners that I make that don't already come in a box end up coming out pretty poor..I'm fully ready to admit that.  Now that that's out in the open, this recipe was SUPER easy to follow.  I followed it to a T except I subbed rosemary for thyme.  Every step went off without a hitch and by the time I was done, I was super proud of myself, it looked and smelled great...but I had that one burning question left...did it taste good?  The answer is YES, it was delicious!  On par with something my husband might make, and he's a chef!  I highly recommend this recipe to anyone, but especially to the fumbling cook such as myself ;)  If you're a novice cook and need to make a dinner for guests-I'd say this is your #1 fool-proof guest pleaser!  Also great for any occasion though.

The only thing I did different was take boneless chicken breasts, covered with basil and seasoned salt/pepper.  Left out the butter at the end.  Absolutely a fabulous smell infuses your home.  GREAT, easy meal!

great recipe, i added a bit if 10%cream at the very end of the reduction to bring the flavours together and add a smooth texture to the sauce which was nice but not needed. My only suggestion is to double the recipe because you can't have too much of this sauce

It was easy to make and delicious. I agree I skipped the flour as there is nothing worthwhile in adding it. At the end I added a bit of cornstarch in some chicken broth and added it while simmering the sauce at the end, it helps make it thicker :)

Had to simmer the sauce for about 15 minutes to get it reduced to a creamy consistency.  Omitted flour and salt.  It was SO yummy.

SO delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I skipped the flour as others suggested.  I used a bit too much oil and vinegar, so I poured some into another pan and sauteed zucchini to have as a side dish.  Boyfriend said it was "on the next level."

The chicken was nice and moist, however the actual flavor of the chicken itself was a bit bland.  The mushrooms cooked down nicely, though.

Yuk.  This would be good without the vinegar.  Substitute white wine instead.  Vinegar belongs in a salad.

Spectacular!  My husband isn't a huge fan of chicken breast without a fattening sauce but he LOVED this.  He must have said so 5 times.  The only thing I would change next time is not dredging the chicken in flour.  I think it is an unnecessary step and mess and just adds calories.  It might be necessary to help the sauce thicken but I'll work it out with cornstarch next time (if needed).  It was so quick and easy for a midweek meal!  Thank you for this recipe!!!!  Loved it.  Lastly, I didn't add the butter and never missed it.

This dish produces the most interesting, incredible smell while cooking. The only issue I had was that there is no mention of how to cook 4 chicken breast simultaneously in the same pan, I have never seen a pan that big in my life. I had to split the breast into 2 pans and return all back to one before adding vinegar and other ingredients. It came out awesome!

I love this recipe!!!!!!! I will be making this every week for dinner.  I can't wait for my friends to come over for dinner because I know they would love it.  I made it with white vinegar since that's all I had around the house and the taste was amazing. Thank you for sharing this recipe with us :-)

Oh My!!!! Balsamic vinegar is a nectar of the "Gods!"  This is a light version of our favourite Bavarian restaurant in town.  Divine!!!!!!!  The entire family of picky children eaters loved it and the best part is that I wrote it out off the website (as my printer is too far away to move the computer to...) and my husband made this while I was away visiting my parents.  What a totally fabulous meal.  Right up there with Christams and Thanksgiving dinner.  Truly a religious experience.  Can't say enough about this recipe!!!!!  100 stars!!!!

My 14 year old neighbor wanted to have a cooking lesson, and picked out this recipe.  It was a very easy recipe.  It came out great, except didn't produce enough sauce.  Next time I will add a little more liquid.

The sauce was very delicious.  I used 2 chicken breasts, but the slightly smaller one came out quite dry/chewey.  Any tips for keeping it tender would be great.  Still giving it 5 stars for an amazing sauce, and I think the chicken would have both been tender if of the same size.

Very good!  I used far more cloves of garlic - but only the small ones to the inside of two bulbs.  I also didn't have as many mushrooms as the recipe called for, and can't wait to try it out with the proper amount.  I did only make two chicken breast halves, not four . . . and followed the recipe for the sauce.  It was just barely enough for two.  If you are making this dish to serve 4, I would double the sauce part of the recipe.  We served this over white rice - it's what I had on hand.  Next time I'll try wild or brown rice.  I read a few reviews that said that they cut back on the vinegar, because of the flavor being too strong.  Also, some added a touch of cream to cut the vinegar flavor.  I didn't follow these recommendations and thought the sauces flavor was very good.  We did add some additional salt to our individual dishes, to our liking.

Awesome!  My teen son wondered out of his bedroom wondering what that awesome smell was.  I loved this definitely a keeper.  Made as per stated and loved the wang of the vinegar.  Hate mushrooms and so does the rest of the household so I can't speak about how they turned out.  Thanks for the submit.

This recipe was tasty  however a bit bitter.  I think next ime I will use less balsamic vinegar and add fresh basil instead of bay leaf.  I thought it needed some sweet.  I served the chicken over buttered egg noodles.  I will definitely make this again.  anne from oakville

I didn't have any thyme on hand, so I threw in a sprig of fresh rosemary to cook for a bit (not the entire time, rosemary is too strong), and it turned out delicious.    Will definitely be making this again.  Reminds me of chicken Marsala but with balsamic vinegar rather than Marsala wine.

I made this tonight for the first time and just finished eating.  It is a very good recipe.  I followed other user's suggestions and omitted the flour, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  I may add just a bit more vinegar next time as I like a little stronger flavor.  The sauce was great and I made roasted baby potatoes for a side.  This is quick, easy, yummy, and healthy.  This is definitely a keeper.

This is a seriously delicious entree. In fact, it was such a hit that I'm fixing it for the second time in as many weeks. I did follow some of the listed variations: 1. pounded the breasts to an even thickness 2. skipped the flour and 3. reduced the vinegar to 3T. I was concerned that the chicken might be tough; it seemed like a long cook time for a boneless chicken breast, but it was tender and delicious.

one word - AWESOME! I just bought my first bottle of balsamic vinegar and I decided to try this recipe out. It was so juicy and delicious.  I did omitted some ingredients (flour and butter) though as so not to add on calories (I'm on a weight loss plan) and it still taste great!   I wanted to use button mushroom but didn't have any and so I used buna-shimeji and it was good!   I did a minor change to it. Instead of adding the garlic after you saute the chicken, I saute the garlic first, then only saute the chicken  I added cooked rice a few minutes before taking the pan off the stove. The rice would absorb the flavour from the sauce. Tasted good.  Anyway,this is a quick,easy and simple recipe. Good for the health conscious and those who are on a weight loss program

I followed the recipe exactly and it was good. However, the sauce was too watery. Next time I will try thicking with cream or corn starch.

After reading the reviews, I was very excited to try out this dish. I made it exactly according to the recipe. It was good but I didn't find it to be restaurant quality like some others. I had the reduction over rice and that was good. The chicken, even with the reduction, needed something. Not sure yet what that something is but I will experiment with this recipe in the future.

Great recipe! Balsamic ended up being a little strong flavored so I might consider boiling it down a bit more and adding more chicken stock the next time. But this meal pleased my mom, who is a devout believer in delicious sauces. I served it over a bed of lettuce. Yum!

I made this for the first time yesterday and definitely plan on making it again sometime. I didn't use mushrooms at all because my boyfriend and I both hate mushrooms, but did everything else exactly the same. It was absolutely delicious, and easy to make. My boyfriend ate all of his share in one sitting! (That means it was VERY good)

This is SO good!  I needed something to do last minute with some chicken and it was fantastic.  I didn't have any mushrooms, but will definitely do this again and throw them in.  I also has really thick chicken breasts so I had to cook them a bit longer.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly as written.

Made this as written (except I didn't dredge in flour...low carb diet) up until the end when I began to simmer the sauce. I love balsamic vinegar, but I thought it was too strong at this point, so I added more chicken broth (about a half cup) and a few tablespoons of cream to the simmering sauce. Loved it!

This is really good.  I was concerned that it would be too watery to work with the mushrooms but it thickened well enough.  I will definitely use this sauce again

Very yummy, a company dish no problem.  I used fresh thyme, I just prefer fresh herbs.  The sauce is to die for.

I have made this recipe several times!  It has become a staple in our family.  The only thing I do differently, is I coat the chicken in breadcrumbs, rather than flour.  I don't get the slimy effect, and it does add a little thickness to the reduction sauce.

Excellent flavor!  I took the advice of others and didn't bother with the flour.  My chicken breasts were really thick, so instead of pounding them, I butterflied and cut them all the down the middle in half.  I also used marinated jar mushrooms instead of fresh.  It was so tasty!

this was delicious. i liked the flour on the chicken, but you need just a thin layer of it. Other than that it's a keeper and i will definitely make this again.

I love to make this easy recipe! I agree with a previous review and only use 1/8 cup of balsamic vinegar. I also add a large diced onion with the mushrooms and serve it over brown rice. Delicious!!

i really liked this recipe, however I wasn't sure what to do with the garlic.  Unless I missed something I didn't see what to do with the garlic, to chop it, mince it,or leave it whole so I left it whole. Since my husband isn't a huge fan of garlic that gave me the flavor without it being over powering.  I would definitely make this again.

I didn't flour the chicken like most people said. Instead, at the end I thickened up the sauce with corn starch. I had no bay leaves so I omitted that as well. However, I didn't think this was an amazing recipe. I thought it was just ok.  Not something I would prepare if company was coming over. On the other hand my husband loved it, and said he would definately eat it again.  I guess to each his own....

Easy, Flavorful, and low in fat! I Grilled the chicken breast after I evened it out and dipped it in white wine, and took it out early from the sauce to keep it moist.  I used the same amount listed for the sauce but only 2 chicken breast halves, so I would double the sauce if I were to use 4 halves. i didn't have any thyme or bay leaves, so I used sage, and it still turned out good.  Added a teaspoon of honey to enhance the sweetness and thickness.

Tastes great. Even my four year old ate it. I had a hard time getting the sauce to reduce properly. After I had already plated it I realized I hadn't finished the sauce with the butter. This would have thickened the sauce...oops! It was still very good, and easy. I will make this again.

It was yummy, but I made a few adjustments...I followed others' recommendations, and omitted dredging the chicken.  I seasoned and browned both sides, removed the chicken, sauteed mushrooms, garlic (2 cloves) and onions, scrapping up the browned bits.  I added the vinegar, about 1c. broth, bay leaves and tarragon because I had no thyme. I simmered for a few minutes, put the chicken back in to finish cooking.  removed them again, I found the sauce a little acidic, so I added more broth to dilute the vinegar, and flour (approx. 3 tbsp) and sour cream (about 1/2c.) to make it creamier. Tossed it with noodles and chicken and it was yummy! next time I`m going to use a little less vinegar.

we really liked it but I will use a more robust balsamic vinegar next time.  I used instant potatoes instead of flour.  ended up using canned mushrooms and I think it would be much better with fresh.  I just love this site. keep up the great suggestions.  I learn a lot from the reviews too.

Easy and wonderful. The recipe didn't specify if the garlic was to remain whole or chopped, so I did chop it.  Very good recipe.

Used boneless chicken breast filets.  I didn't realize we were out of Balsamic vinegar so I had to sub Tarragon.  It was just wonderful!  We omitted the butter at the end but thickened with flour/water.  I agree with the previous reviewer about making more sauce and putting it over pasta next time.  Chicken was very tender and melt-in-your-mouth good.  Thanks!

This recipe was fabulous.  I really enjoyed the strong balsamic flavor (so if you're not a big balsamic fan, I'd cut it from 1/2 to 1/4 of a cup.)  I think when I make it again I'll make it with more sauce; I had put it with fresh pasta and a little more sauce would have covered it more nicely.  Overall GREAT recipe, I highly recommend it!

Great recipe.  I made it without mushrooms, as my husband does not like them, and it still came out great.

Pretty good.  I might like it better if I substituted wine for the balsamic vinegar.

The flavor was wonderful. I did add a little less balsamic vinegar from reading the reviews, not much less and I do think I would have enjoyed it with the full amount. I also pounded the chicken for a little more absorption of the flavors.

Very flavorful way to cook a chicken breast very quickly. I don't think my sons will eat it, but we'll see about my daughter. Some onions would be good in the reduction too. I don't think you need the flour either.

I made this for my friend and bf and they both loved it! I substituted the thyme for rosemary,added two more cloves of garlic and also added inch size pieces of hand full of asparagus. When I was reducing the sauce I decided to add a couple teaspoons of flour to thicken it. It was a hit and I will definitely make it again.

Two words: astoundingly delicious.  Boy, was this easy to make without fussing around in my kitchen.  I had to tweak it slightly because I'm a college student and didn't have fresh mushrooms or chicken broth on hand. Instead, I added chopped onion with the garlic, and a can of cream of mushroom soup when adding the vinegar.  The resulting sauce was so wonderful my roommates were ranting about it while licking their plates!  This recipe is a keeper if there ever was one!

Delicious and easy - it quite nearly cooks itself!  Perfect for company or a weeknight dinner.  I would, however, caution against the recommended amount of balsamic - the sauce is a little sharp.  Use a bit less/more chicken broth.

I thought the flavor was wonderful.  My husband thought it was good but that the sauce was a little oily so maybe cut down on the olive oil next time.  The kids weren't huge fans but then again they rarely are...

I've done this several times now and love it. I prefer not to cook the liquid additionally at the end,  so it's less thick. No matter how you do it though it's a delicious dish.

Pretty good. Didn't change the ingredient amounts but omitted the flour step like others. I screwed up at the end because it seemed the liquids needed to be thickened to be more "saucy" so I added cornstarch. Well, it was too much and the mushrooms ended up tasted "gummy" like they had congealed with fat on them. I would try this again and I'd be able to make it a 5 star.

Wow, I am so happy I found this. I haven't actually tried to make it. But last week when I was walking through my apartment building, I smelled someone cooking something delious and I wished it was coming from my apartment, but I thought my husband was for sure not cooking. But it turned out the smell was from my apartment! I saw something that looked like an attempt at chicken stroganoff. What I tried was THE BEST sauce I've ever tasted. It was amazing, I was so confused how he made something so good, I felt embarassed of all my past dishes. I'm on his computer now and the only receipe in the recently viewed is this one... he got the receipe here! I don't know if he followed the directions exactly or not, but I do know he added a little sour cream at the end. This receipe is amazing. SO thankful I know how to make it now :D

This was wonderful! I skipped flouring the chicken as other reviewers had mentioned and omitted the mushrooms because I don't like them. Other than that, I followed the recipe and it was very very yummy! I served with garlic sgetti which I think is a must to complete this dish!

Delicious! I, too, omittted the flour as other reviewers suggested. It turned out moist and flavorful. I served it on a bed of whole wheat pasta and my hubby loved it! Even suggested that this would be a great recipe to use for entertaining. I will use this recipe often!

This is one of the best recipes I have ever made on allrecipes!!! Absolutely scrumptious and incredibly easy! I too, left out the flour and simply browned the breast. I used bone-in chicken as it was on sale. After pulling out the chicken to thicken the sauce, I used a fork to pull the chicken meat from the bone. I then added the meat back into the thickened sauce. The other alteration was that I used red wine vinegar, owing to not having balsamic. The meat was juicy and tender, which made me so happy- despite all the yummy things I cook, my chicken has a habit of being like shoe leather, and horribly dry. But not anymore!!! The flavor was lovely. The husband and kids LOVED it~~~ Everyone ate 2 bowls, and are asking me to make it again very soon. Thank you, thank you, thank you, for this fabulous recipe!!! We've a new family favorite!

Delicious! The balsamic adds a nice little zing to the chicken as well as the mushrooms.  The sauce really was delightful, from what I tried.  I ended up letting it simmer for to long and boiling out most of it, which I would advise against because it tastes so good! I will be trying this one again soon!

My family enjoyed this. my personal preference will be to decrease the vinegar to 1/8 cup the next time I make it. I also used italian seasoning & 5 garlic cloves.

I made this for a dinner party of friends and we all loved it.  I feel that the recipe calls for a lot of garlic, but to each his own.  I agree that i will double the sauce next time, because it was so tasty.

I loved this!!! Very flavorful!!! I love balsamic vinegar so I found the quantity to be no problem at all. Only things I did different was added a little flour at the end to thicken up the sauce to make it gravy like as well as leave out the bay leaf and thyme (only because I didn't have any.) I served it with mashed potatoes and green beans.

PHENOMENAL!!! This recipe is restaurant quality for sure! I skipped the flour step and added 1 tbs brown sugar when reducing the sauce. I also used fresh thyme. I was eating the sauce by the spoon full...sooooo amazingly good. Will make this again and again.

Loved this! One thing I changed. Add the flour after you've taken the chicken out of the pan, that way the chicken retains it's texture and you get a nice sauce that coats well.

So tasty, and I don't even like vinegar! I cut the vinegar in half, though just out of my fear of vinegar smell/taste. In the end I wished it more sauce to serve over the quinoa. Next time I guess I'll do the called for vinegar and add extra chicken broth. It was delicious!

The sauce is divine. Used red bellpepper instead of mushrooms, and they soaked up that sauce perfectly with a smooth blend of flavor. You could add any veggie and it will be awesome probably. Substituted dried basil for the thyme. Don't need to flour the chicken, but I did end up adding a little flour to the sauce at the end a thickener. The butter at the end also adds such a special touch. Wish I had made some kind of cheesy mashed potatoes with this, as it just seems like a perfect match.

This was very good!! It wasn't anything special and easy to whip up, which is nice for families. I wouldn't make it for a special evening, however. I also would have added more balsamic... not sure what some people were complaining about on that. Overall, I would make it again for a quick dinner.

My family loves this recipe.  We make it quite regularly.  Today I had to make it without the chicken broth - didn't realize I was all out and it just wasn't the same.  Follow the recipe and the taste is excellent!

This is a great recipe. I used chicken strips and cut them in half to make them thinner.  I used canned mushrooms instead of fresh, thats all I had.  There is a very strong vinegar taste and i used less than the amount called for because thats all I had.  To thicken the sauce I added some corn starch to the rest of the can of chicken broth and added that to the sauce.  Very easy.

This recipe was excellent!  I did change this a little bit.  I used turkey breasts because their leaner and diced them and threw them in the oil with the garlic and canned mushrooms (which was all I had on hand) then added the balsamic vinegar and let that cook in for about 30 secs and then added the broth and spices.  I sprinkled a bit of flour in afterwards to thicken the sauce.  Then after it was all done thickening sprinkled some chopped green onions on top!  Looks lovely and tastes even better.  Thanx for a wonderful but easy recipe :)

I made this as my first foray into using balsamic vinegar in cooking- I'm so glad I did! I made this first time around for my boyfriend & his Mom and a friend of his, and they gave it stellar reviews. The chicken was juicy & wonderfully flavored, and the juicy balsamic mushrooms were also delightful. I am currently making it now for my roommates- this is definitely going to become one of my staple dishes!

Loved it! Not a big fan of balsamic vinegar so I used red wine vinegar. It was wonderful. I did flour the chicken breasts after pounding them a little and to the flour I added some garlic powder, and other seasonings. I doubled the amounts as I had a big package of chicken breasts and then had the left overs for lunch during the week. I did add a little chicken broth to the lunch containers so that the chicken would not dry out during reheating. A big 5 star winner. My family loved it.

I'm trying to learn how to use balsamic vinegar more in my cooking since it is a low calorie way to add flavor to my food. I found the sauce a little too watery for me. The flavor was good though. Next time, I will bake my chicken instead so it's more moist.

Tasty!  I doubled everything in the sauce except for the balsamic vinegar and we thought it was perfect.  I too skipped the whole dredge in flour step.

I love the sauce this recipe makes. I added extra sliced onion and sliced the chicken breasts into bites to make it faster for me and easier for my kids. YUMMY!

This recipe turned out awesome! I followed directions exactly except I added the butter early and simmered it for the 7 minutes. Tons of flavor and easy.

This was one of those dishes that became a 'regular' in my house. The sauce goes well on steamed carrots or brocolli. This was great!

Loved the sauce!  I did not have fresh garlic, so I used garlic powder... still came out delicious.  Cant wait to make this again with the real thing.  This is an easy, delicious weeknight recipie.  I might just make the mushrooms with sauce to serve with steak too.

This was by far the most moist chicken I have ever prepared on the stovetop. It had wonderful flavor, not over powered by the vinegar. We had company over and it was loved by all. I wouldnt change a thing. Until becoming a stay at home mom, I frequently ate at 5 star places in downtown Seattle, and felt this was as good if not better than those $40 chicken breasts! Thankyou!

Like others suggested, I omitted the flour.  I just added a little bit of corn starch to thicken the sauce at the end and it worked perfectly. Flavor was great for both the sauce and chicken.  Easy and quick to prepare.  Great for a last minute dinner idea.

This was good and has 5 star potential. I made this recipe without any alterations. The vinegar was too strong however...and I like balsamic vinegar. Next time I will cut the vinegar by half.

Yummy!  I made this with vegetarian chick'n breasts (seitan) and followed the directions to make it for two.  It was fantastic.  I liked the breading but didn't think it added to the final product.  My seitan chick'n breasts were a little thick so next time I'll cut them in half width wise.  Thank you for sharing this great recipes.  Forgot to add that I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth.  Still delicious.

This recipe was fabulous. I had all the ingredients already so it was a no brainer. It was quick. I used canned mushrooms, instead of fresh, but it turned out really good. I didn't have just balsamic vinegar, but I had balsamic vinaigrette dressing, which made the sauce thicker. My picky 3 year old inhaled it. lol. Great recipe!

I followed the recommendations of others and left out the flour.  I used a spare amount of a salt/pepper seasoning mixture on the chicken prior to sauteeing the breasts, and I also pounded out the breasts to make them as flat as possible prior to cooking.  I also added diced red onion with crushed garlic since I only had about 1/2 lb of mushrooms.  I didn't reduce the sauce much at the end, and there was plenty left over for putting on top of mashed potatoes.  I used dried parsley and a bit of thyme for the seasoning in the sauce.  Very yummy and really easy to make!

It was very good but I did double the sauce to have enough to go over pasta. I did not double the garlic or vinegar though, and thought it was just right.

The chicken is extrememly tender!  I served the chicken and sauce over pasta, and will not prepare it that way again.  The sauce and mushrooms have a slightly strong vinegar flavor.  Next time I prepare this I will serve it with a side of potatoes and only use the sauce spooned over the chicken.  I have never had chicken this tender before, it was great!

This was good. I skipped the flour step and used at 6 oz can of sliced muchrooms because I didn't have fresh. I simmered the 'sauce' for 10 min but it never thickened the way I would have liked. The taste was still good and the sauce went over rice nicely. Give it a try

I've made it already three times. WONDERFUL AND MOIST!! I did reduce the vinegar like some suggested and added some half and half for a bit of creaminess. All in all just the perfect chicken recipe.

Pretty solid.  I drizzled a little honey in the sauce right before i took the chicken out.  I had planned on adding a little cornstarch, but i thought the sauce was plenty thick.  I like mushrooms more every time i eat them!

Loved this recipe and will definitely make it again with the following changes:  reduce olive oil to 1 tbl, eliminate the flour, and reduce garlic to 2 tsp of jarred minced garlic (4 cloves).  Everything else was perfection.  Thank you for such a fabulous recipe!

Wow! This recipe is not only delicious, but it's so easy! I love something I can make in one pan. The chicken was tender a juicy and the sauce made for an elegant presentation. My balsamic vinegar was good quality, but not great and it was still out of this world.  Can't wait to try it with some better aged balsamic vinegar!

Wow, we thought this was great.  It was nice and juicy with a nice mild flavor.  My chicken was thick so it took a little longer to simmer but it turned out great.  Will make again, thanks so much!

This is so delicious!  Love recipes with Balsamic Vinegar & this is one of my favorites.  I tend to make this a little more saucey & serve over rice.  Even if you don't have the Bay Leaf this is a great recipe!!!

I was a tad bit skeptical about this recipe at first, but since I am a fan of vinegar, I tried it anyway. My husband really enjoyed this dish!! I liked it too. We poured some of the chicken sauce on our mashed potatoes & this was a hit too. Enjoy!!

I followed the recipe except omitted the flour and there was WAY too much vinegar.  The mushrooms were almost inedible because of the vinegar taste.  The chicken was ok, but I think every chicken dish is just ok (I don't think I've ever had chicken that was GREAT).  I won't be making this again.

I thought this was decent. I followed recipe as written, and I would agree with other reviewers that the flour really isn't necessary. Chicken was tender, and I thought the mushrooms tasted great, but I didn't feel this was a "wow" kind of dish. Probably won't make again.

Delicious, so good, and easy to make! Made it for the first time last night and it was so tasty! Gourmet cooking at home. The sauce is excellent with rice. Next time, I will probably cut down a bit on the vinegar as it was a little too tangy. Otherwise, definitely a keeper!

The reduction itself was a five for sure; I used a maple balsamic I have and the little bit of extra sweetness was wonderful.  Plenty flavorful.  The flour-browning with sauce, however, left the outside of the chicken mushy.  I had left the breasts VERY lightly floured so I thought I would be safe, but leaving them naked would definitely be better next time.  Won't change a thing otherwise.

My family loved this recipe!  Thank you. I made it according to the recipe and wouldn't change it at all.  The garlic is not overpowering.  I was careful not to let the garlic burn when I added it to the pan.  DELICIOUS!

Very good.  We prefer it with the flour left out.  Instead, I use some cornstarch to thicken the sauce just before serving.  The butter is not needed!

Let me begin by saying I am NOT a mushroom person, in fact the idea of me eating this was slightly repulsive. Well, turns out that I AM a mushroom lover with the right dish and this is definitely it! I thought I was crazy for making something I didn't think I would like, but I'm glad I did because this is one of the most interesting recipes I've made all month. The sauce was delicious and even though everyone said skip the flour, I didn't and liked the thin coating because it helped soak up some of the sauce. The chicken was nice and moist and I served it over pasta with asparagus. Delicious! Also, tasted good reheated which is important because I cook for myself only and always have leftovers. This one is going in my recipe book!

This recipe was quite easy to make and the chicken turned out really good.  I wouldn't say it was worth 5 stars but it was worth making again.  I may add some red wine into the reduction next time and possibly marinate the chicken, since it wasn't too flavorful without the sauce.

This recipe was DELICIOUS! It was so easy and tasted amazing! We actually forgot to add the butter, but it didn't seem like anything was missing. I put some feta crumbles on top, and served it with broccoli and spinach fettuccine. I wish we had enough for second and thirds!

OMG, this received RAVE reviews from the BF.  It's a very simple recipe to follow yet yields impressive "I slaved all afternoon to cook you this fancy meal" results.  Unlike some other people here, I did coat the chicken w/flour...though very, very sparingly.  I probably could have used just a little more to make sure the sauce reduced better.  I also think that next time I will leave out the Bay Leaf - it's just not a flavor that I care for and I think the dish will be fine without it.

We thought this was okay...not the best chicken recipe we've ever had but would probably make again.  The only changed I made were using canned mushrooms rather than fresh and also left out the bay leaf.

It was okay but not what I was expecting.  I used chicken tenders instead of breasts and I think that may have been part of the problem.   Also, the reduced sauce looked like gravy... I think maybe next time I will add some cream like somebody suggested.

This is good. I used all of the ingredients, but browned the chicken and finished it off in the oven. I sauteed the mushroooms & garlic in the chicken pan and finished the sauce there to pour over the finished chicken. I did end up making more sauce since I had of ton of mushrooms I wanted to use. It turned out amazing, mister thrilled. Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this turned out nicely, I followed other reviewers' advice and did not flour the chicken. I thought the sauce was really good but the chicken did not have a ton of flavor itself. I think next time I'll put more seasoning on the chicken and maybe pound it thinner so it can absorb more sauce. Overall this was very easy and a god recipe. Thank you!

On it's own, it's an okay recipe. I'd use less vinigar next time, though. It's really similar to chicken marsala, but not half as good.

This is the best recipe I've made with balsamic vinegar.  My picky, persnickety mother came over for Sunday dinner and couldn't stop complimenting me.  Thanks!

This was such an easy, yummy recipe! I always like to try the recipe as written first, but I only had 1/8th cup of balsamic vinegar and not enough fresh mushrooms, so I used one can in addition to the few fresh that I had. I'm definatley going to make this again, but with the full amount of vinegar and lot's of fresh mushrooms next time. The only thing I found I had to do was add a little flour to the sauce to thicken it slightly. I forgot the butter at the end, but it was still great without it. This is a keeper for sure! I noticed that many people were saying the flour on the chicken made it goopy - you literally just *dust* the chicken...pick it up in your hands and pat the excess flour off - you aren't supposed to thickly coat it or it will end up that way. Try this recipe...you won't be disappointed!

I was shocked by how good this turned out. Added a few other seasonings and some minced onion. I honestly just picked up this recipe because I didn't have to go shopping for any extra ingredients, and ti blew away my expectations. I'll be making this again and again and again!

I loved this recipe!  I took the suggestion of the other reviewer and added a can of diced tomatoes w/ garlic & onion. I also added the garlic cloves from an entire bulb. I added a bit more chicken broth then the recipe called for.  It turned out really moist and flavorful. I put it over orzo pasta which worked very well with this dish.  Will definitely make again.

This was pretty good. I too left out the flour like some suggested and was great without.  I did thicken the gravy after I removed the chicken out with cornstarch.  I may use alittle less balsamic vinegar.

We tried these last night and really enjoyed them.  The only thing I did different is omit the bay leaf.  Even the kids enjoyed them, although they dipped their chicken in ketchup instead of using the sauce. We will definitely eat these again!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I did only put a small amount of flour on my chicken after reading the suggestions.  I was worried the sauce would be a little strong, but it was a perfect combination to the chicken.  I served it with steamed baby potatoes and found the sauce was a great match with them.

I didn't have a mallet to flatten my thick chicken breasts, so I sliced them in half. They were a bit overdone in the end. I also halved the vinegar as many suggested, but I think I might try it full-strength.

I don't usually like chicken breast but this was quick. And a 1-pot, no fuss meal since I used pre-sliced white mushrooms. I had mistakenly pre-seasoned my chicken for something else so I plan to to make this again and pre-season with just garlic before pan sauteeing. Yum!

I really wanted to like this, but I was not hugely fond of the flavor.  I'm willing to try it again to see if maybe it was just a fluke.  On the plus side it was easy to make, and I like that it is a healthy dish for my family.

Amazing! The aroma of this recipe would make any one want to try it. I omitted the flour and used mushrooms from a can, because that's all I had on hand, but it still turned out to be very very good. Next time I will add some garlic powder to the recipe, since my husband and I are big fans. A huge thank you from both my husband and I.

This recipe is Great!  I love balsamic vinegar and this recipe hits the spot.  It was an easy recipe to prepare and tasted oh so good.  My picky husband loved it too.  He couldn't get enough of the sauce and mushrooms. I may try and double the sauce and mushrooms next time. I can't wait to make it again.  An excellent recipe that is good for everyday and for a dinner party.

This was really, really good!  I did not use the butter at the end.  I used whole wheat flour.  I served over wheat pasta.  Tasted like it came from a restaurant!  Update:  I did not use any flour at all this time and served in a bowl.  SO yummy!!!

LOVED this recipe!  I didn't even have all the ingredients on hand...  I was missing garlic (used garlic powder)and I didn't have mushrooms, so I just did without!  I LOVED this chicken dish!!  It was very tasty and my husband loved it too!  He doesn't like mushrooms, so he was happy without it!  Next time I might do the mushrooms on the side for me and I might also omit the flour since it got all soggy and made the sauce really lumpy...  But even with that happening it still tasted yummy!!!  I made this with Chicken Fried Rice and it was GREAT!

This is the best chicken recipe ever.  It is also very diet friendly.  My family raved over it and I shared it with my sister who made it for a date and it was a huge success.  I didn't change a thing except I didn't serve it over rice but with wild rice as a side dish.

Amazing! This is my newest favorite chicken recipe. It tasted like something right out of a fancy resuraunt. I followed the recipe, only adding a little bit extra mushrooms, and one whole cup of chicken broth. This was delicious!!!! I will make it over and over again!

This was really really good!!I tweaked it a little bit though, I had no thyme (I no a sin. I don't know how that happened) so I used about a half a teaspoon of dried parsley flakes and a couple pinches of Italian-seasoning. I also found that two tablespoons of oil and two tablespoons of flour was not enough. after the chicken browned I ended using about a tablespoon more of oil. but overall it was hit!!

This recipe was good.  I didn't have the same problem with the flour that others seemed to have; I just made sure the flour wasn't thick, I barely dusted the chicken with it.  I didn't have a bay leaf, but the thyme worked just fine.  We're not used to cooking with vinegar, so following the advice of others I didn't put all it called for, just a tad less, and that was perfect.  Along with the mushroom I included onion.  I served with this site's Garlic Red Potatoes and it was a nice meal.

my husband and i thought this was a pretty good recipe. the chicken turned out very juicy with a suttle flavor. i was however a bit disapointed, i expected more flavor. there was definietly a balsamic flavor but the other spices really didnt come through much. next time i think i will add a bit more of the seasoning to it. but like i said, very juicy and a good recipe, just tweek it up a bit with the spices.

Wow! I love this recipe, and normally I'm not a fan of chicken breast, but I'm trying to cook more healthy foods. Easy, and the taste is unbelievable. I used whole wheat flour, seasoned with a little bit of Paprika and poultry seasoning. Also added some more whole garlic cloves as one of the reviewer recommended - so good!

It is one of the best recipes here and it's easy!!!  I didn't have any bay leaf or tyme on hand and it still turned out flavorful.  I followed the recipe exactly and the flour worked out great.  I suggest that you make sure your chicken is pat dried and seasoned.  I used all seasoned salt and peppers.  Then let it sit for a few minutes before you dredge the chicken through the flour.  Make sure it's not clumping.  If the flour clumps on the chicken your sauce will too.  Brown it and follow the recipe as directed.  If you don't like the tartness you can add half a tablespoon or either brown sugar or regular sugar to offset the tartness.  Enjoy!

I did not care for this recipe. First off the browning made the "skin" hard and the chicken was very dry. The Blasamic was very overpowering & bland at the same time. The sauce never thickened. Will not be making this one again

This is a super dish! One hint is to defrost your chicken breast, then put them into a ziplock bag and pound them thin! Then dredge them in the flour and continue with the recipe. It makes the chicken tender, moist and delicious!

This recipe was great. I pounded the chicken breasts until they were about 1/4 inch thick. This made the chicken very tender. Next time I would add more Vinegar,garlic and mushrooms to enchance the flavor.

This was really good!  I didn't have fresh mushrooms, so I used 4 small cans of sliced mushrooms.  I added a bit more balsamic and broth, but there still wasn't THAT much sauce.  I thickened it up at the end with a little cornstarch slurry.  Overall, very easy, tasty and good!  I just wish there was more sauce...

Just made this tonight.  Following a couple of other reviewers advice I did not use the flour.  I thought this recipe was great.  It had wonderful flavor and the best part was that it was easy to prepare.  Also, it's great for those of us that are trying to watch our weight.  Made some brown rice and green beans to go with it and everyone loved it.  Thanks for the great recipe.

My goodness. How can something be this good? I didn't have any thyme available, but had everything else. I only cooked one breast since I didn't have the thyme; can't wait to cook it according to recipe...which will definitely be tomorrow. :-)

Wonderful!! The only thing I changed was to omit flouring the chicken...just being lazy. The flavor of this is incredible. My husband, who is not a big chicken fan, loved it and all of my 11 children couldn't get enough. Thank you for sharing!!

This dish looked really good, but it wasn't my favorite as far as taste goes.  It needed some additional flavor to balance out the strong vinegar taste, but I'm not a good enough cook to know what flavor that would be.  :-)  It wasn't bad, though.  Everyone ate it without a complaint, so if you're looking for something different, give it a try.  You might like it.

AMAZING! My boyfriend said it was probably one of the best things I have ever cooked!  We will definitely be having this again!  I took one reviewer's suggestion to add more garlic, and it was perfect!  I ended up adding about 8 cloves total.  The way the chicken gets soaked in the balsamic is absolutely to die for!  We are HUGE balsamic and garlic lovers so this couldn't have been better!  Definite keeper!

This was a fun and very delicious dish to make. I did everything as written except that I used boneless chicken thighs instead of breast meat, thigh meat always seems to turn out moister for me.  I only browned the thighs for about 2 minutes max on each side, pulled them out, sauteed the mushrooms and garlic, then added the thighs back in with the broth and vinegar, and spices,  to simmer for 20 minutes on a low simmer.  They turned out perfect.  I almost missed the end step of reducing the sauce down, then adding butter at the end, I am so glad I did this, the sauce turned out great.  I will make again.

I, too, didn't flour the chicken and used chicken tenders instead(took the wrong pack of bird out of the fridge this morning) My fiance thought the vinegar smell was overpowering and was skeptical to try it. We both were very pleased. It was easy, healthy and super tasty. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

Not a favorite.  Actually tasted rather bland with a slight hint of sweetness that was unpleasant.  Trying to figure out what to do with the leftovers - of which there are quite a bit.

EXCELLENT! The sauce is great on STEAK too....especiall filets!  Prepare the sauce following the recipe exactly as the recipe calls for...only omitting the chicken and flour.  Prepare your steaks separately from the sauce!  Salt & pepper each side of your steak and then sprinkle about 1/2 tsp sugar on each side as well (for browning).  Pan sear for 1 minute on each side.  Then put in pre-heated oven (325) for 15-30 minutes depending on the thickness and your preferred doneness.  For more details on this method, please see the article on this site entitled, "Great Steak - How to Cook for a Crowd".  These come out FABULOUS every time.  My dad and hubby think these are much better than any steak at any restaurant!

I thought this was fabulous. Word of warning, though: it is definitely very "vinegary". If you don't like vinegar (the smell or the taste) you might want to stay away from this one. That being said, I love vinegar and loved this chicken. I served mine with broccoli and a baked potato, but next time I would like to serve with mashed potatoes.

This was very good, basically the same as chicken piccata but with balsamic vinegar instead of lemon juice, which was a nice change and gave the sauce great richness & depth.  The chicken comes out very tender and the mushrooms are a nice touch.  It's wonderful served either along rice or over mashed potatoes. A very easy meal, but also very impressive!

Pretty good...I either didn't like the amount of balsalmic vinegar used or the quality of my vinegar wasn't that good (I had to make do with a cheap brand...it was the only one the store had).  Anyway, the sauce was a touch too vinegary for me.  Not sure if I would make this again but I am glad I tried the recipe.

As someone else said, I don't understand what all the raving is about.  Which is OK - we all have different tastes.  I just wasn't excited about the combination of the flavor with the chicken.  It was OK, but seemed like too much trouble for "OK."  I didn't have trouble with the chicken being dry, as some have.  But I do agree an extra seven minutes on the sauce would about do it in.

I'm happy I tried this recipe, I had all the ingredients except mushrooms so instead I used onions that was suggested by another reviewer and doubled the liquid to have extra sauce, I put it over whole wht pasta and it was perfect! Def I will make again, can't wait to try with mushrooms.

THIS RECIPE IS GREAT!!!  While reading the reviews we skipped on the flour also.  And my husband forgot to pick up the garlic cloves so we used minced garlic...worked out just as great.  The taste is phenominal!!!!  Even my 2 year old daughter ate the whole thing...  We also used portabello mushrooms and although the sauce was minimal...next time we will double the sauce mix.  This is one the whole family will LOVE!!!

This was easy and tasty, my husband who does not like vinegar at all really enjoyed this one. We don't eat mushrooms but this worked just as well with cooked brocolli believe it or not! I added a packet of chicken gravy and 1 tablespoon of cornstarch but this was for 3 chicken breasts. I served this with sauteed crispy thyme potatoes that i broiled for a while and they really made it.

Thanks!

An excellent recipe.  The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that it is very similar to chicken marsala in preparation and idea and I LOVE marsala.  So in comparing, I just can't quite give it the same as marsala.

I followed this recipe with the exception that I added a little sliced purple onion when I added the garlic to the chicken. It was absolutely delicious !!!!! So tasty and juicy, I served it over wheat noodles with a side salad. This will be a regular in my gouse.

This turned out delicious! I made this with Spanish rice. In the future though, I would pair with a plain rice dish because the flavor of the sauce is very strong and does not mix as well with other strong flavors.

I thought this was a pretty good recipe.  The only thing I would change next time is the balsamic vinegar.  It was a little too strong for me.  I might try balsamic vinegarette dressing to still add great flavor but cut down on the strong taste of straight vinegar.  Makes a really nice sauce.

This recipe was phenomenal and I will make it again and again.  My husband absolutely loved it.  When I removed the chicken, I added one tablespoon of flour to the sauce to thicken it up and it was perfect.  Oh, and I used 8 cloves of garlic.

This is a fantastic recipe. I have been making it for years. By chopping garlic it has a much stronger flavor.  I throw the cloves in whole, or cut in half, they come out softened, and we either shmear the garlic on bread, or slice it thinly (after cooking)and eat it with bites of chicken.

I skipped dredging the chicken breast in flour and I sprinkled the thyme right onto the chicken breast.  The sauce and the mushrooms saved the dish.  The chicken breasts came out way too dry.

We really liked this recipe, I used baby portabella mushrooms because their flavor goes so well with Balsamic Vinegar.  Next time I make this, I am going to pound the chiken to make it thin, so that it will stay as moist as possible through cooking.  All in all, a great recipe.  Wonderful paired with Bacon and Balsamic Glazed Sugar Snap Peas allrecipe recipe courtesy of jonnyd523.

This was AMAZING.  I didn't change a THING and let me tell you how great it was.  I made it for myself and felt like I was at a really nice restaurant eating a really expensive meal.  I put the chicken and sauce over some spinach noodles and I can't WAIT to have leftovers tonight!

Very very good!  Basically doubled the liquid part of the recipe so there would be plenty to put on the pasta....added a little cornstarch towards the end to thicken up a bit.  Highly recommend for a great tasting, easy, quick meal!

Really good! This would be a great dish to have when company is coming over - very impressive looking and tasting. The only thing different I did was to add some cornstarch at the end to thicken the sauce. Other than that the recipe is perfect as written!

A delicious meal!  Make sure you watch the sauce as it's simmering (when it is covered).  I turned my back to wash a couple dishes while my sauce was simmering, and I turned to find my sauce had splattered out of the pan and made a little mess around the stovetop!  Oops.  :P  Luckily I caught it in time before all my sauce ended up on the counter.  I really liked the garlickiness of the sauce(I probably added more than required) and the mushrooms were perfect.  I only wish I had some more to add!  I served the chicken with steamed rice and a mixture of steamed veggies.  Simple but flavorful meal.

I really loved this recipe. I can't believe people cut the vinegar in half! I used all of it and it still turned out much more subtle than I thought it would. I may even increase it next time. For the garlic, I crushed 5 of the cloves and minced 1. I will probably mince at least half next time, it definitely wasn't overpowering and could have used a bit more kick to it. I served this with oven fries and it is definitely something I will be making often. Yum!!

This was my first time cooking with balsamic vinegar, and I found the taste to be a bit strong for me, even though I served it over white rice to dilute some of that flavor.  That said, I would probably make this again, just with less balsamic.

I followed the recipe as listed and we did not like the flavor - too much vinegar for our taste. The chicken was very tender though.

I made this for dinner for hubby and myself and we both loved it. He is not a vinegar fan so I added that part later to my serving which worked fine. I used more flour and more chicken since I had thawed quite a few breasts. It worked out fine. I loved the flavor of the thyme. It added just the right touch. I might add some canned tomatoes next time making it kind of like chicken chasseur. Fresh mushrooms are a must. Thanks for a great recipe.

I have tried this recipe a couple times now and absolutely love it. I stay true to the original recipe except I add potatoes to the pan with the chicken, Then when adding the mushrooms...I add other veggies such as carrots, turnips, parsnips. When it's finished I have a delicious meal that took no time at all.

This was very easy and tasty. Even my extremely picky 3 year old loved it. The only thing I didn't do was add the mushrooms because we're not fans, but I don't think it altered the true essence of the dish. We loved it!

I made this in my oven because I broke the lid of my crockpot just as I was ready to put everything in!  I made the recipe as written except that I added about 2 1/2 cups of chicken broth plus a little white wine that I used to deglaze the pan I browned the chicken in. I expected more evaporation in my oven casserole than in the crockpot, but I should have used at least 4 cups of liquid because the sauce reduced down to a very intense but delicious 1/3 cup.  I used the juice of half a lemon plus an extra squeeze from the other half and it was perfect.  I baked it in a covered casserole at 325 degrees for 3 hours.  I will try this again in my oven with more liquid and the mushrooms some other reviewer suggested.

This was a great change from boring old chicken breasts.  I will use a little more balsamic vinegar next time since I love the flavor. I also ommitted the flour as I didn't find it necessary. Very good, even the little ones ate it!

Awesome dish! Flavor was spot-on for a gourmet meal, everything meshed very well together, and will be great for lunch tomorrow too. 
As mentioned by others, I doubled the sauce, which worked well when serving with pasta.

I loved how easy this recipe is! I followed some other suggestions and just omitted the flour and the chicken turned out great. My only complaint (even though it's not really even a complaint) is that the chicken didn't absorb much of the flavor. I would probably marinade the chicken in the vinegar/broth mixture for about 30 min beforehand

OMG this was the best recipe that I've gotten from this website. The only thing I left out the flour due to other suggestions. It was mouth watering. I also combined with another allrecipes recipe... roasted garlic mashed potatoes. And some corn. DELICIOUS!!! Will definitely make again!!!! Thx

Yum, Yum, Yummy!  I was planning on making Chicken Marsala when I received this recipe and wanted to try it!  It turned out so good!  The chicken was so tender and tasty...and the mushrooms were just SO GOOD, next time I am going to add even more mushrooms! My 6 year old son even liked the mushrooms! I loved the sauce to top it with too - I just wish I would've made more, next time I'll use more chicken broth. I did make some changes: First of all I pounded the chicken out, I also added garlic to the salt and pepper (as recommended by another review), I used wondra rather than regular flour (that's usually what I use for chicken marsala), I used Balsalic Vinaigrette rather than Balsalmic Vinegar - but I cut the amount in half as recommended by a lot of reviews and I think it would have tasted even better if I would've just used the whole amount!  Also, I didn't have Bay Leaves or Thyme - so I just used an Italian Seasoning that I had.  SO GOOD!  I will make this again & again!

Loved this recipe. The sauce is to die for, although next time I might add some capers. So glad I tried this because it solved a years-old mystery. I used to order something called steak contadina at a local Italian restaurant and I tried many times, without success, to duplicate the sauce (thinking it was made with lemon juice) and it was always way too acidic. Duh!! I now know it was balsamic vinegar.

Wonderful!! I can't believe how "gourmet" this tasted, based on how easy it was to make. We have a mushroom allergy in our family, so I replaced those with peas, which I didn't add until right at the end. This has a spectacular flavor and would probably go well with all kind of side dishes. We had brown rice and butternut squash, which made for an interesting flavor combo. I will most definitely make this again and again!

This was Great!I pounded the chicken between plastic wrap. So it would cook evenly. Didn't have fresh mushrooms so used a 4 oz. can. and used 1/2 tsp. thyme. It turned out moist and delicous.

Made this last night for dinner. I am trying to cut out flour from my diet so I made it exactly as stated but without the flour. My family loved it! Even though I made extra chicken to bring to work with me, there was none left because people ate seconds! I served it with mashed cauliflower and zuccini squash. So simple and good. Will make again for sure.

I just recently tried roasting garlic -- 350 degrees F. for 35 minutes -- and I feel like the 40 year-old virgin: Why didn't anybody tell me about this stuff before?
 
Good with potatoes. Good with any meat. Good with flash-fried French-cut green beans. Good with beer.
 
As I get older things just get better!

This recipe was excellent!!!  I cut up the chicken breasts into bite size pieces and used about 4 TBSP of flour instead of 2 TBSP.  I will definitely make this again.  I served mine over risotto.

WOW.  This is only the second recipe I've tried from Allrecipes.com and it was nothing short of perfect!  I used chicken tenders instead of full size cuts and they still stayed very tender.  This really tastes like a dish from a fancy restaurant, but it was fairly easy to make.  The only other differences were that I used a bit more garlic and butter.  Thanks for the great meal!

Wow! One of the best recipes I've made on this site. I followed the recipe almost exactly (a hair less olive oil and light butter), and my husband told me I should make it every other week.

I thought it was good, but based on the reviews I read before making it I expected something more.  I used more garlic than called for but still didn't feel that the taste came through.  I think crushed garlic would have been better maybe.  It is a keeper but nothing outstanding...I wonder if I did something wrong?  The sauce was good but no wow factor.

Absolutely delicious!  For some reason, most of the sauce evaporated so I did need to add more chicken broth and balsamic vinegar.  Will definitely make again!

I doubled the mushrooms and used a sprinkle or two of flour near the end to thicken the sauce but otherwise left evrything else as is.  Goes great with string beans and mashed potatoes. Yum!  Thanks, Colleen, for a verrrrrry tasty chicken recipe!  :)

Wonderful recipe. I didn't flour the chicken as per a lot of reviewers here. I also didn't have any thyme or bay leaves but I used some marjoram in my any-herb-will-do mentality. Also used Portobello breakfast mushrooms (not the button types). As for the vinegar, i myself am neutral to it and i used the full amount. I thought if it was reduced, it wouldn't taste as good. Boyfriend loved it too. Served with rice and stir-fry veges for a complete meal.

I made this exactly according to the recipe and my husband and I both found the chicken to be dry.  I think this has potential, but next time I will cook the chicken for less time before adding in the sauce ingredients.  I also think the cooking times were too long.  Ten minutes was way to long to cook the chicken and seven more minutes reduced my sauce to almost nothing.  I would make this again, but cook it for less time and add some white wine and rosemary to balance the flavors.

This recipe would be better with bacon or panceta to flavor it.  However, I would say it was a good, easy recipe.  However, leftovers were hard to get rid of so that is why it gets an ok rating.

So good!  Pretty quick & easy to fix too.  I would double the sauce next time though.  My husband said reminded him of my Chicken Marsala, but I can taste enough of a difference to say they are different.  Sure good & this one's a keeper!

This recipe really is unbelievable.  I was looking for something quick and easy and didn't really expect much out of this but WOW!  This may be my favorite dish from allrecipes so far.  And I've made dozens.  

The only change I make is adding the garlic (through a press) when I add the liquids to prevent burning.  I also omit the flour.  Other than that I scale down to 2 and follow the directions as stated.  5 out of 5.

I really liked this recipe.  I have tried cooking chicken in a vinegar sauce before, and it came out way to strong.  This was much milder and still savory, and the chicken was super moist.  Definitely a keeper!

Amazing recipe. Marking this as one to serve to company. I found my chicken a tad overcooked but I may have seared it too long initially. Also, think chicken definitely works bested. Served it with a side of aglio olio.

OMG!! What a fantastic meal. My 6 year old son even asked for seconds. I did not add the flour as per the suggestions I added it after to thicken the sauce and I pierced the chicken to allow the flavors to go right through. I otherwise followed all the instructions. I can't wait to have company so I can do this easy and fanstastic meal for them. Thanks for the wonderfull meal.

I followed the recipe except for the mushrooms as I did not have any and my kids hate mushrooms.
It was good.  I simmered on very low and the breasts didn't dry out.  I added a touch of flour to keep the sauce a bit thickened.
Very good.

I liked this recipe, but I didn't LOVE this recipe. I followed the advice of a lot of other reviewers and doubled the sauce, but I halved the Balsamic vinegar. It was a good dish but not one that I would rave about. My teenage son really liked it, my 9 year old daughter did not, at all.  I think that the problem I had was I did not have any fresh mushrooms and had to use canned, not so good! I would like to try it again with fresh cremini mushrooms, I think that might make a HUGE difference. Overall, not great,  just good, will try again. This is a good recipe to use when you have almost no  groceries and are pressed for something basically healthy to put on the table fast.

This was very good.  I made this with three large chicken breasts bone in skin on which is all i had. I needed a recipe that I had all or most of the ingrediants in my pantry so tried this one. Didn't have fresh mushrooms but had everything else and I doubled the sauce thank goodness because it sure needs it especially if you are going to top noodles as I did or even rice.  My son and husband loved this dish.  Was great for a quick week night meal.

Great recipe!  It was very easy to make and the flavor was awesome.  I followed the advice of the previous reviewers and skipped the flour and added just half the vinegar.  It was amazing and I'll definitely be making this again.

Really liked it as did my 2 very picky eaters.I did omit the flour as well. It was    very good. Next time I will reduce the balsamic a little. I served it with brown rice and steamed broccoli. It was excellent!

I found this recipe just OK.  The kids liked it but I found the vinegar masked the flavor or the garlic, mushrooms and chicken.  Since the kids liked it I will make it again though....but reduce the vinegar, increase the garlic and add some onions.

Fabulous flavor.  After reading reviews, I left out the flour but thickened at the end with about 1 T. of cornstarch.  I also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  Next time I think I'll try serving with rice (the sauce would be great on it).

I've made this twice, both times it was excellent.  The first time I followed the directions, including flouring and sauteeing the chicken.  The second time I did not flour the chicken and added diced tomatoes.  I actually liked it a little better flouring the chicken.  The trick is to flour the chicken and to shake off all excess flour, fry in a hot pan.  The diced tomatoes suggested by another reader was really good also, and will probably be the way I make it from now on. This was really quick and easy, especially if you don't flour the chicken or dice tomatoes.

I thought this was very tender and tasty.  I love the subtle sweetness that the balsamic vinegar lends to this dish.  The mushrooms are delicious when saturated with sauce.  Yum!

This recipe is just nice for me and the flavour is not really that overpowering. I am thinking of cooking it as a main course for one of my school's exam. I think it's going to help me pass my practical cooking test with flying colours! Thanks for sharing! (:

This was a really good recipe....but I didn't have much luck with the flour.  Almost all of it came off the chicken.  Other than that, great flavor and great taste.

My wife and I loved this dish, we added more garlic and used portabello mushrooms and placed the chicken on top of some pasta noodles.  We highly recommend this dish, it is fairly easy to make and very tasty!!!

Very flavorful and easy to make (my 3-year old even helped!!). If you're not a fan of Balsamic vinegar, you probably won't like this one since the taste is pretty strong. I used the recipe as-is. Will definitely make again.

Made this for tonights dinner.  My husband said this dish is diffently a "keeper".  I din't have boneless chicken so I had to let it simmer a little longer.  The remaining sauce I served as a dipping sauce.  I will fix this again for sure.  Thanks! !

I added a couple extra cloves of garlic and left out the bay leaf on accident but it tasted great. The vinegar taste is strong so if your not a huge fan of vinegar I would reduce the amount slightly. I will make this again with the bay leaf and still some extra garlic.

YUM! My whole family loved it! Even my 2-year-old ate it really well! Just a lovely flavor, not too strong, the chicken brother mellowed the vinegar nicely without losing the flavor. Will make again!

I really didn't like this AT ALL!
What I will take away from this cooking experience is that the only way I like balsamic vinegar is -cold- over avocados and tomatoes.

This has just a tad too much vinegar in it for our tastes, but wasn´t too overbearing, next time will add less... other than that pretty good.

I love this recipe. The chicken always comes out tender and very flavorful. I follow the recipe almost to a T. The breading definately adds to the chicken, just make sure it's browned well, or it'll get pasty.

Great recipe. I doubled the sauce and served the chicken over pasta. I used sliced portobello mushrooms. I will definitely make this again.

This is one of my favorite chicken recipes. It's easy, flavorful, and pretty healthy. The flavors work well together. I usually serve it with Jasmine rice and fresh steamed brussles sprouts. Yum!

Definitely a tasty chicken dish! Super moist and tasty. We added extra mushrooms to the dish which made the sauce a little too watery, but overall it was an excellent dish.

To anyone who is unsure: DON"T BE AFRAID OF BALSAMIC VINEGAR!!  I followed this recipe as written, though I thought the vinegar may be overpowering.  I must say the three fellows I fed it to (who are used to eating in quite nice restaurants) absolutely RAVED about it. Thanks so much for posting !

Very simple and quick recipe.  I followed reviews and did not flour chicken before frying (just seasoned w s&p.  Didn't have any fresh mushrooms so I used canned...it was still good but would be amazing with fresh.  I also added onion and red pepper which added a nice flavour.  A new favourite, thanks for sharing!

This was pretty good.  My kids wouldn't touch it, but I suppose that's asking too much!  Make sure you like the taste of balsamic vinegar if you make this.  Otherwise the taste will get old REAL fast.

chicken was very tender and juicy and the mushrooms had a lot of really good flavor. i think next time i might try to marinate the chicken beforehand or something so that it'll have more flavor.

this was really really good and the chicken was really juicy and tender. but whqat is the need of the flour? i thought it was to give the cicken a little batter but most of it came off once i added the broth...ect. did i do something wrong? it didnt affect the taste but next time i would skip using flour....

I 3/4'ed this recipe and used portobello mushrooms.  The balsalmic vinegar taste was quite strong.  I was afraid to use all the garlic it called for, but the mixture definitely could have handled the garlic.  I thought that the recipe included plenty of broth-didn't need more.  It did, however, need more salt than I used.  Will salt the chicken more liberally and add all the garlic called for next time.

Really good!  This is very easy and quick to make...can be a thiry minute meal easily.  Very moist and packed with flavor.  I too used more chicken broth, and am glad I did.  Next time I think I'll add green peppers and onions to the dish...just for fun.

Very nice recipe. I didn't have mushrooms so i used red onions and red bell pepper instead. I marinated the chicken for a few hours with half lemon juice , salt and pepper. Afterwards i followed the recipe as it is. Maybe next time I will used more broth and balsamic vinegar to more sauce. I was surprised with the taste, it was very tasty with mashed potatoes

I just finished this dish, and loved it. My 'tween and teen also loved it. 10 YO said, "This is really good, Mom." High praise! The balsamic was indeed apparent, but in a very tasty way. I served with baked sweet potatoes, and the sauce was delish on the sweet potato, too. I'll definitely make this one again!!

Just made this for the first time tonight for me and my roommate. We both thought it was great. I took the advice of one of the posters and used portebello mushrooms in the sauce, which were really nice. My only criticism is that I found it was a bit salty once it reduced, and next time I make it I'm going to try using water instead of stock, or maybe half water, half stock. All in all, though, great flavour, simple, quick, and definitely open to playing with. I served this recipe with lightly sauteed asparagus and roasted potatoes with rosemary. Worked beautifully.

This recipe is very good. I didn't have any mushrooms and am not a big fan of them so I made it without them. It was a hit with my 6 year old and my husband. Thanks for the recipe. The sauce is delicious. It's a keeper!!

Easy, quick and good. The sauce is really good, we spoon it over brown rice and serve it with a steamed grean vege. I followed recipe exactly except I used smart balance spread instead of butter.

I LOVED this recipe.  It has a great kick.  I followed other reviews and took the chicken out after I sauteed it, and then made the sauce.  My husband isn't a mushroom eater and I was worried he wouldn't like the balsamic vinegar, but he thought this was great as well! (Mushrooms included.;)  Thanks for a great recipe!

It was good but had less flavor than I'd expected given the ingredients.  Next time I'll increase the garlic.

I reduced balsamic to 1/2 and was still too strong. Next time I'll add chicken stock and cook in crock pot.

I was really excited to make this recipe, but was somewhat disappointed. It was quite bland. I followed the recipe exactly other than flouring the breasts before frying. The chicken was very moist, but the sauce needs something else. I will try it again, but I will add more garlic and try either some sherry or burgandy wine.

Delish! I made this with a one and three year old underfoot and it was easy and great tasting. I added cornstarch/water mixture to thicken it up some, but after I did realized it probably didn't need it as the sauce ended up a little too thick. Thanks for the recipe!

SOO easy and SOOO good. I usually leave the extra sauce on the side instead of right on the chicken. I also press the garlic into the skillet instead of just chopping to get a little more flavour.

Take my rating with a grain of salt: my hubby doesn't like balsamic vinegar in general, so his personal taste affects my end choice! I thought it was really yummy, though I diluted the sauce with more chicken broth because the b.v. was a tad too intense for me. Just as a note to myself, my hubby said he would eat this again when we're feeling stuck in a rut and want something different.

This was fantastic. I didn't have mushrooms and omitted the flour after reading the other reviews about it becoming slimy. I added cornstarch to the sauce after cooking the chicken and used rosemary instead of the bay leaf. It was so good, I can't believe how few healthful ingredients can taste so good! This is def. going in my recipe box!

This is the first recipe that I pulled off this site. It was fantastic! My fiancé loved it so much. We made two portions of this along with some baked new potatoes. The total cost for all the ingredients was about $16 ($8 of that was chicken). Wonderful! Will save this one and try it again.

This dish was very good! I was surprised how little I could taste the garlic. I used portabello mushrooms and enjoyed the flavor but not the texture of the mushrooms but that's nothing new for me. I served it with mashed potatoes. We enjoyed this quick but tasty dinner and I will definitely make this again.

Very good. I was looking for a yummy healthy alternative to the same old grilled chicken and I found it! I omitted the butter at the end to make it more Weight Watcher friendly, couldn't tell a difference at all. Next time I make it I'll wait a little longer to brown the chicken then remove it before cooking the mushrooms and sauce so it stays crispy and just pour the yummy sauce on right before serving. I loved the kick the garlic gave. I winner! :)

This was good, but not fantastic. I agree with a past reviewer that the flour gave it a slimy consistancy. Maybe I used too much flour because I do not ever remember this being the case with past meats that I've dredged in flour. Very good for dinner, but did not eat the leftovers.

Family voted this one a keeper! Tripled the sauce recipe (and mushrooms) and served it with mashed potatoes and a veggie. It was yummy. I did use cut up chicken instead of the boneless, chicken breasts. Worked great, chicken was super-moist. I did not use the flour and pulled the chicken as soon as it temped-out (use a digital meat thermometer for a quick and reliable reading). Used a cornstarch mixture to thicken sauce and then swirled in a bit of butter at the end. Decadent.

I was looking for something not saturated in fat, but with some taste. I found it with this recipe. A definite keeper. My husband and I loved this. The only change I made was to use portabella mushrooms (just a personal preference). It turned out wonderfully. The chicken was tender and the sauce was to die for.

I can't say enough about this recipe. I have been using recipes consistantly from this site for 2 years, and this is at the top of the list. It tastes like it's from a restaurant. The flavors are out of this world! It is so quick, easy, and utilizes ingredients already on hand. Thanks so much for posting!

This dish was very quick and easy to make; I bought mushrooms that were already sliced. It tasted wonderful! The only change I made was I left out the thyme. This recipes will be added to my collection.

EXCELLENT! The mushrooms were ok in it, but I left them out the second time I made it. Didn't have any chicken so instead I used pork loin that I pounded out and used a whole can of chicken broth. My husband said it tasted as good as if we had gone to a restaurant!

Yummy and easy.  Only change I will make next time is adding more 'shrooms - we love mushrooms in this house!  As suggested, I used a full can of chicken broth.

My husband loved this dish. As there are only two of us, there was enough left for another meal, and he didn't mind leftovers.

This recipe called for toooo much garlic and too many mushrooms. My boyfriend and I couldn't even eat it. It was really easy to make, however it was given to the dog pound (our 3 American Bulldogs.) Sorry!:-/

Absolutely delicious and very easy, had everything on hand.  Followed recipe pretty much as is.  I add a little extra garlic for my taste but that's it.  Husband loved it. Made with roasted red potatoes and sauce was great on those too.  Thanks for submitting. Can't wait to make again.

DELICIOUS!!!  I've had this is in my recipe box for about 2 years and finally made it -- oh my -- it was amazing!  My husband kept saying that it was restaurant quality.  I used a pound of mushrooms, but other than that I made it exactly as written!  This will definitely go in our family favorites!

So good and easy!  Every time I make chicken breasts, they turn out like hockey pucks...this was an exception!  I even froze and thawed the leftovers and they are just as good left over.  Thanks!

i thought this recipe was very yummy. It did not take a lot of time to prepare and it was very simple. I loved that it was a healthy dish that actually tasted good! the chicken came out moist and tender instead of dried out. My only complaint is that it could have used more spices. I added a few pinches of greek seasoning to it as well but it still could have used more flavour. Overall, great recipe and will make it again!

This is SOOOOOO GOOD!!!!!! I followed the recipe almost exactly except I left out the bay leave because I didnt have any, used a little ground thyme, and some extra stock. The chicken was extra moist. The leftovers even reheated wonderfully. I served it with a parmesan risotto. Even my sorta picky bf loved it.

I made it for the first time tonight and the Kids and I loved it...(My husband hasn't tried it yet cuz he's on his way home from work).  I do agree with one member who stated that there was too much Balsamic...the next time I will decrease the amount of Balsamic by 1 Tbsp.  All other ingredients and amounts will remain the same.  Bon Appetit!

Easy to make, looked fantastic and tasted as good as it looked!  I don't usually like vinegar but this was very tasty...just a little zing but not overly tart.  I added a pinch of sugar to cut some of the tartness but probably didn't need to.  I used 1/4c balsamic vinegar and 1 cup of broth, a heap of garlic and and a heap of mushrooms...perfect amount of sauce for 3 large chicken breasts=)

Fantastic!! I had to improvise because all I had was vegetable flavored chicken broth, and canned mushrooms...and it still turned out great. I served it over orzo and the whole family loved it! Will definitely make again!

I just made this and we absolutely love it. I made it with two large, boneless chicken breats instead of four. It came out perfect as is, with no changes. I would double the ingredients if I were using four breasts.This is really TERRIFIC !!

Tried this variation the other night. It was pretty good, but a little too much balsamic for us. I had to "fix" the leftovers by adding more broth and a little milk. I prefer the "Chicken with Wild Mushroom and Balsamic Cream Sauce" on foodnetwork.com

The chicken did not come out moist and tender. usually when i marinate chicken breasts in apple cider vinegar they stay really tender. it wasnt very flavorful. maybe i overcooked it? disappointing

Very tasty and moist. I made it exactly as directed though we only had canned mushrooms on hand, but I think over all it had the same taste. We will try fresh next time. I paired it with oven roasted red skin potatoes mixed in olive oil, rosemary and kosher salt and pepper. We also had steamed string beans. It was a nice meal, easy to prepare, and I liked having it all ready to go in my pantry.

Although I love balsamic vinegar, I didn't really like this sauce. It really tasted terrible when I tested the flavor of the sauce alone - but was OK when eaten with the chicken. I followed the instructions.

This is a breed of recipe that always makes me sad because it has such POTENTIAL for greatness and yet falls short. The sauce/broth around the chicken turned out VERY delicious, but unlike some concoctions which infuse the meat with the flavor of the sauce, the chicken itself remains bland. It was still relatively "yummy," but not as amazing as I expected from the reviews. What could make it more "amazing"? I suggest doubling the amount of mushrooms (and searching for more WILD mushrooms like chantrelle) and also doubling the garlic, plus lessening the time the chicken is cooked and making sure the breasts are pounded thin & TENDER. But all in all, not a bad recipe by any means... just not heart-stopping amazing.

I love anything with balsamic vinegar in the recipe. This came out wonderful. Very juicy! I doubled the sauce so i could pour it over my side dishes as well. I paired it with mashed potatoes & baked asparagus.

I used far more mushrooms and almost a head of fresh garlic, but only because we love mushrooms and garlic.  It was delicious and the menfolk loved it, so it's a keeper.

Excellent. Pounded chicken breasts first. Used 4 portobello mushrooms, roughly chopped. Used 2 tbs. minced garlic and added with the mushrooms. Sliced chicken and returned to pan to serve. I've made other similar recipes that turned out too tart. This one is perfect and the chicken was tender and juicy.

this recipe is now one of my husband's favorite. The balsamic vinegar and garlic complement each other great. I did not use the mushroom and sauce was still great.

Very good and easy recipe. I used portebello mushrooms and minced garlic. Next time I will increase the garlic and the broth. Went very well with wild rice and salad.

Fantastic taste and what is even better this is a recipe that a kitchen klutz like me found hard to get wrong. I left out the butter to make a healthier dish and it tasted great.

Good, smells wonderful cooking. Keep the chicken in the pan and I omit the butter. Nice with egg noodles and snap peas or green beans.

This was a good recipe and like others have posted, it's a good idea to cut down the Balsamic Vinegar unless you really like it. I only used an 1/8 cup and also added 1/4 cup of Zinfandel. Otherwise this was a good recipe and the chicken was moist and delicious - I will definitely try and make this again.

Just ok.  Probably won't make again.  Except for the vinegar, it was pretty bland.

Very good flavor.  I din't like the "mush" factor of the breading but it did taste good and we will try again with maybe a little modifications.  Thanks for sharing.

Loved this the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was there was to much Balsamic Vinegar for my taste.  My husband gave it 4 1/2 stars.  I will make this again but with about 1 or 2 tablespoon less Vinegar.

My family and I really enjoyed this dish.
I left out the flour, oil and butter. (Being on weight watchers, wanted to watch my points). I added a little ICBINB Spray at the end to give it the flavor of butter. It was great. Will definitely make again. Thanks for this great recipe.

This was awesome. My husband and I licked our plates clean. I served it with rosemary and thyme roasted potatoes, and it was amazing. Will DEFINITELY make again. It was very elegant-seeming without a lot of hassle.

We liked this very much.  I didn't remember to thaw the chicken so I used those individually frozen chicken breasts that come in a big bag.  I cooked them half way on my indoor grill then, finished up exactly like the recipe directed, except I added a sprinkling of freshly grated nutmeg on the mushrooms.  Served over rice with a side of Corn and Zucchini Melody leftover from last night...it was good!

Very Tasty!  I used bone in chicken breast (adjusted cooking time) and did not have any mushrooms on hand. Will try with mushrooms next time. Gourmet style dish. Wonderful flavor.

Vinegar is very strong flavoring.. and I thought the breading was great but it just fell off in the liquid.. making it mushy.  I'll simmer for less next time & cut the vinegar in half.

I tried this recipes tonight, and my family loved it!  The flavor was excellent.  The only thing I changed was I swapped canned mushrooms for the fresh, because we don't care for fresh mushrooms, and I used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic.  I loved the taste of the mushroom sauce, and I served the chicken over a bed of rice with a side of carrots.  This is going in my recipe book!! Thanks so much!

I'm giving this three stars only because my fiance liked it.  I thought it was edible but not great.  I like balsamic vinegar but for me this was too much.  I used 1/2 really good balsamic, and half regular old grocery store balsamic.  Maybe it would be better with all good vinegar.

The vinegar taste really overpowered the chicken.  I usually like the taste of balsamic vinegar but I guess just not with chicken.  My husband did like it better than I did but I probably won't be making this again.

OMG! This recipe is so yummy. I stuck with the recipe pretty much. The only change I made was adding spices into the flour- oregano, basil, and garlic salt. I used real balsamic vinegar and served it with spiral noodles. Next time I will double to sauce!

I give this 10 stars!  My family loved it...took the advise of some other reviews and increased the chicken broth (used a 10 oz. can), and increased the balsamic vinegar to 1/3 cup, used about a lb of mushrooms and 8 cloves of garlic....the only thing I would change next time is to add a couple more cloves of garlic ( the balsamic overpowered the garlic flavour).  Next time I entertain, I'll be pulling out this recipee! Savory!

Yummy! The sauce is so good I am glad I increased the amount by 1 and 1/2! Other than pounding the thick part of the breasts so that they would cook evenly, I made as is...delicious! It was hot here today so I served it with a brown rice salad also from this site. Enjoyed by all, thanks!

This was good.  I used thin sliced chicken breast, added 1/4c white wine to sauce and used jarred minced garlic.  I thought the flavors went very well together.  (No mushrooms, can't stand them.)   It's a nice change from "cream of" type recipes, although my sauce didn't reduce much.  Tasty - will make again. Update:  made again.  still no mushrooms.  no white wine.  used FRESH garlic cloves and coarsely chopped.  cooked chicken, took out, let sauce reduce at least 10 mins with the help of some wondra flour, then dipped chicken in sauce again to warm up.  served with the gourmet mushroom risotto (minus the mushrooms) from this salt, and the balsamic asparagus.  YUMMMMMMM!!!!!!

Excellent flavor! I made the full amount of sauce even though I was only making 2 chicken breasts and it was perfect.

This was very easy to make with ingredients I always have on hand and my husband loved this dish!  I ended up adding more chicken broth though because when I tasted it during cooking, the vinegar seemed really strong.  Otherwise, the chicken was very moist and tender and had great flavor... I will defintely make this again!

I liked the balsamic reduction.  Using a good balsamic is key, though.  We will make it again.

Excellent! The whole family loved it! I received this recipe via "The Daily Dish" from Allrecipes.com and have to admit after reading thru it, I wasn't sure if we'd like it. Turns out, the only thing we didn't like was the fact that there wasn't enough! Amazing - quick - easy - and delicious.  Thanks for sharing!

I didn't have fresh mushroom, so I used canned mushrooms, and this was still a great recipe.  The chicken breasts came out so moist and tender!

This recipe was awesome. My finacee is on a lower cal diet and I thought he was getting bored of steamed veggies and stirfries, I am so glad I found this recipe and so was he! I found the sauce a bit too runny so I added a bit of flour to thicken it up so it appeared to more of a gravy. Definetly make it again, and I don't eat much Chicken!!

It was a good recipe, next time I will add more balsamic vinegar, the more flavor the better. And I confess...I did add a bit of cayenne pepper for a bit of a bite.

Very good, tomatoes and basil were a little much but gave the chicken a nice flavor. Will probably make it again, maybe next time chop up the basil & tomatoes and add some ricotta cheese.

Excellent and very easy to follow.  Didn't think the taste was too strong at all.  Made rice as a nice dish and poured some of the sauce on the rice as well.

I made this last night and actually found it lacking in flavor. Not what I expected-maybe next time I need to use more Balsamic vinegar, than the amount outlined in the recipe.

I was pleasently surprised at how easy this was to make and how GREAT it turned out. I love balsamic, but I dont think it was too overpowering, just enough. This was quick and easy to prepare...and looks fabulously gourmet.

I made this dish last night and it was delicious. I used about 4 cloves of garlic that I chopped in a food processor. I also used baby bella mushrooms. I did not add salt and pepper to the flour mixture as recipe indicated and it still was tasty.  Served this meal with garlic mashed potatoes and a nice crisp salad. I will be making this recipe again.

Only adjustment that I made was adding some wine with the chicken broth.  Turned out great. A nice change from a creamy sauce.

This was an easy dish that tasted pretty good, but it wasn't amazing.  I didn't have a bay leaf or thyme, so I added Italian seasoning instead, and that probably affected the flavour.  I also used a bit of red wine b/c I didn't have quite enough balsalmic vinegar.  The sauce was good, I especially enjoyed the mushrooms.  I will make this again some time, but I don't think this will become a regular meal at my house.

I did use about a lb. of mushrooms and instead of salt and pepper to taste in the flower mixture and on the chicken I used garlic salt (I LOVE garlic). Also, I think the flower mixture on the chicken is important because it does add to the flavor of the chicken and helps thicken the sauce as well. A MUST TRY!! :)

I like this but the vinegar was too strong.  One of my children ate it but I won't make it again.

this recipe was so easy and quick to prepare. The flour dredging made the difference since it left nice brown bits in the pan, which added to the color.  I added 1/2 c port to the balsamic vinegar which gave it a really deep flavor.  I served it with rice and salad.  My husband is sparse with culinary compliments, but this he really liked!  A great recipe!

Had to add an onion and reduce the garlic to 2 cloves (who needs 6 cloves of garlic???)...added a splash of red wine to counteract the too-tangy taste of vinegar...still ended up just ok...this is a lot of effort for just ok!

I loved the vinegar taste.  If you like balsamic, you will like this dish. The chicken didn't take up enough of the flavor though.  Maybe I should have pounded them thin.

Wonderful recipe.  My picky eater 7 year old even devoured it.  Of course, I had to omit the mushrooms to have any hope of it being a hit, but it was still wonderful.  I added a bit more butter at the end to lessen the vinegar taste of the sauce, again just to make it more kid friendly.  Will definitely add this to our regular list.

This dish was excellent! My husband and I absolutely loved it. I also reccomend doubling the sauce like many others have. At the end I thickened the sauce with corn startch. I served the dish with rice. Yum!

Tasty! I used the recommended amount of balsamic and found it just tangy enough. I didn't have any garlic cloves (sinful), and garlic powder was just fine. I browned the chicken on both sides before adding other ingredients (why not?) Preparation time was minimal, which is always a plus. Thanks!

This was excellent.  As others mentioned, using 1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar was too much; next time I will add half the amount.  I served with a side of whole wheat pasta.

Very delicious!! Although next time I would maybe brown the chicken on both sides insted of just one. We ate this with rice and we put some of the extra sauce on our rice, it was so yummy! This meal has such great flavor.We'll make it again!

This dish came out delicious. I wasn't sure if the garlic was to be chopped or left whole so I chopped them. I didn't flour the chicken but did pound it thin. I also left out the mushrooms, as my husband does not like them.  I used vegetable broth and also used corn starch to thicken the sauce at the end. I served this with brown rice and broccoli. I will be making this again!

My husband loved this.  I omitted the mushrooms and next time will omit the butter.  I gave it 4 stars only because I would have liked a more pungent balsamic flavor.  Thanks for a new chic recipe!

I have been making this recipe for 2+ years and forgot to write a review! I don't care for whole breasts, so i cut into chunks or strips, then flour. I don't remove the chicken, just add the ingredients in the pan for a 15 minute reduction. In the past, we have sub'd red wine vinegar in its place, and is good too. I serve with a Lipton rice and broccoli.

This dish was so easy and had fabulous flavor, great depth.  I marinated the chicken overnight in the balsamic vinegar, other than that I followed the recipe as written.  I knew when my 8 year old son, gave an appreciative YUM that it would be a keeper!  I served it over rice with a salad and a good crusty bread.

We really enjoyed this chicken dish- it was different and was really easy to make.  Next time I will use more mushrooms and broth to make more of the sauce, that was almost the best part.

Wow, this was really good.  I don't think the balsamic vinegar was overpowering at all.  My boyfriend didn't even think so and he's afraid of strong flavors like that.  I did omit the swirling in of the butter into the sauce at the end, preferring to thicken with cornstarch instead.  I served it with sundried tomato basil rice and lemon pepper green beans.  I'll definitely make this again because it's tasty, quick, easy, and you will most likely have the ingredients on hand.

This is a great recipe as-is, but for some variety (and especially if you find the balsamic vinegar too strong), try using seasoned rice vinegar instead (the same amount).  Either way, this is YUM.

This recipe is SIMPLY AMAZING. I did a few things to alter it to our taste, but overall, the recipe is perfect.

Changes: I reduced the vinegar to 1/8 cup & added in a splash of heavy cream at the end of cooking. The cream turned it into a Balsamic Chicken Stronganoff, which we of course served over buttered egg noodles.

I PROMISE, this recipe will go over GREAT, don't be afraid of the vinegar either, the cream will help take the bitterness out of it.

My family loved this dish!  I loved how the mushrooms picked up the flavor of the sauce, and it was a nice change of pace for us, since we eat a lot of chicken (picky husband, lol).  I will double the sauce next time and all all the vinegar recommended because I was concerned that it would be too tangy with the orginal amount, but it was delicious!  Can't wait to make it again.  I used boneless chicken thighs which were wonderful.   Thank you for sharing!

I don't know what I did wrong, but this was awful.  You expect some crispiness, but it just gets all soggy sitting in that vinegar/broth bath.  Mushrooms didn't have enough time to brown.  My husband liked it, but this from a man who turns little down!  Won't make this again.

This was very easy to make with ingredients I had on hand.  I'd call it a win and I will definatly be making it again.

I also thought the balsamic vinegar was a bit too strong.  It's worth making again, but I think I'll cut that down and maybe add a bit of worcestershire sauce or something next time.

Fabulous, easy recipe.  Like others, I'll double the sauce and omit the flour next time.  Otherwise, this one's a keeper for sure.

This was fantastic. I'm making it again tonight. I made a few changes like adding a splash of red wine to the sauce. I also stirred in a little cornstarch to thicken it up in the end. I used a whole can of broth for extra sauce. To coat the chicken easily I put the flour and chicken in a ziploc bag and shook until it was coated well.
This was excellent served over loaded mashed potatoes....

This was an easy recipe, which used a lot of ingredients I already had on hand.  It was a nice change from the normal chicken dish. Will definitely make it again.

This is a good recipe.  Very fast, and what I would call a "pantry recipe" -- you're likely to have the ingredients on-hand.  I wouldn't call it spectacular, but just a good easy recipe that will likely be made several more times at my house.

This was a very easy dish to make and also very good.  I too added a bit more chicken broth (almost one can) and had just enough sauce. I took a suggestion from another review and served with garlic mashed potatoes.  Very good and will make again.

My hubby loved this! However, I must have had the heat too high because my sauce ended up with no liquid! But I just added more stock and it was okay. Really tasty!

This recipe was great!! I used thin sliced boneless skinless breasts, 1 10oz package of fresh mushrooms, quartered the garlic cloves, added a little red wine while simmering and followed all the other directions exactly as they were printed. Nice flavor! I served it over rice with broccoli on the side. The mushroom sauce was sooo flavorful! Thanks for this keeper!!

Wow.  The subtle flavoring on this dish was to die for.  My roommate wouldn't stop complimenting it.  It made our apartment so fragrant!  I served it over risotto with a little sharp cheddar and muenster.  The sauce complimented this wonderfully.  I quartered the cloves of garlic, and even they were delicious.  Thank you for my new showpiece recipe!

Ok, I've had a bottle of balsamic vinegar sitting on my shelf for a year. Didn't know what to do with it, then I found this recipe. This is absolutely delicious! It's tangy, garlicky and rich. It reminds me a lot of the Philipino dish Adobo, but this is a lot quicker.  My whole family loved this, including our kids. Just beware- the vinegar will perfume your house while it's simmering.

My husband hates mushrooms, so I left them out. I also used more flour for dredging because I'm paranoid that I won't have enough! Other than that, I followed the recipe. My husband doesn't usually like robust things so I was a little nervous with the balsamic vinegar, but he loved it! It was such a hit, there were no left overs. I served this with chicken rice pilaf and peas. The perfect dinner!

This was an excellent recipe. One of those recipes that is easy and quick to make, yet everyone will think that you spent hours on it. I recommend using butter, magarine will make it too oily.

I did not have fresh garlic in the house so I used refridgerated minced garlic. I thought it was a good recipe, although it did have a strong vinegar taste. I served with brown rice.

Delicious! I used dark balsamic vinegar because I really love the flavor. Like others, I made 4 servings of sauce to go with 2 chicken breasts. I didn't bother to remove the chicken from the skillet - I just let them simmer away in the sauce while some veggies were cooking. Great recipe, Colleen. Thanks!

I would use an aged balsamic vinegar next time I make this. Its a little more mellow than regular Balsamic. I also threw in a little marsala wine for taste.

I cooked this for my boyfriend for something that was a little change of pace. I added a couple cloves of minced garlic and served it over pasta. We bothed loved this recipe and ate it for lunch the next day. It was even better! Will definately make again.

This was incredibly delicious.  I wouldn't be afraid to serve this at a "formal" dinner gathering.  I don't like mushrooms; but the balsamic vinegar and other seasonings make this yummy!  I even liked the mushrooms.

My family - children included - LOVE this dish!  I made it the first time and followed the recipe exactly but each subsequent time I have altered it a bit just to play with it and I have to say - it's pretty perfect the way it is!!!  I serve it with garlic roasted mashed potatos and add a little extra of the liquid ingredients to spoon some of the sauce over the potatos.  So very yummy!!!

This stuff was tasty! I used canned sliced mushrooms instead of fresh and added marjoram as I was out of bay leaves. Really savory and different. I didn't think the balsamic flavor was particularly overpowering, just tangy and nice. Will definitely "add it to the rotation," as my husband says.

Very good.  I changed the recipe a little since I didn't have all the ingredients.  I used red wine instead of balsamic vinegar.  And I used wild mushrooms.  I served it with wild rice.  I also used thin chicken breasts.  This was really good and would definitly make it again.

Thought this was delicious and the chicken was so moist and flavorful.  I halved the garlic cloves lengthwise.  I'll be making this again.

Wonderful recipe. Used store bought "thin sliced chicken breasts", so it made for a scaloppini - like dish. Because the chicken was so thin, I removed the chicken after browning a few minutes on each side, and added back to the sauce for a minute or two while the sauce was simmering, just to coat the chicken with the yummy sauce. Used only about a tsp of bottled minced garlic. Served with roasted asparagus. Delightful. Can't wait to serve it to guests!

Super easy recipe to make and tastes great too! I used all the ingredients as listed except that I doubled everything to make the sauce and I used small, whole button mushrooms instead of slicing them. Even my picky 3 year old LOVED this. Will definately make again.

Chicken was very flavorful and the mushrooms went excellent with it.  I loved the sauce and was actually surprised that it tasted so good.  Made some mashed potatoes with it and it complimented this dish quite well.  Have made this dish twice already and will most likely make it again.

Simple to make and came out great! I used white balsamic vinegar... don't know if it makes a difference as it's the first time I've ever bought any, and fresh portabellas. I increased the chicken broth a bit for more sauce (glad I did) and served it over rice. I also almost doubled the cooking time as the chicken pieces were big and I wanted to make sure they were done. Will definitely make this again.

YUM!  I used 6 chicken thighs instead of 4 chicken breasts, but used the full recipe for everything else.  It was a bit vinegar-y, so I added about 1/4 tsp. salt to the sauce towards the end and 1/2 tsp of cornstarch to thicken.  I also diced 4 slices of bacon, precooked & drained them and added it to the sauce at the end as well.  Had a little bit of leftover for lunch the next day -- excellent!  Can't wait to make again!  Thanks!!

Pretty easy to prepare, and the family did enjoy the strong taste. I added onion with the garlic, and witheld the bay leaf since I had run out, but it still tasted great. Wish there was a bit more sauce since it would be great over rice. Next time I will increase the liquid factor to do just that.

It was good. A little Salty but I think that was because of the broth. My family gave it rave reviews. They wish there was more sauce (and there probably would have been if I didn't cook it on such a high temp!) and i think it would be good on rice. It was something different to try. I would suggest that perhaps you use bread the chicken with bread crumbs instead of using flour. I'll try it next time and let you know.

My husband rated this a three, and I rated it a two.  So we compromised; I'm rating it a three and never making it again.  He actually had positive feelings for it, but as we reserve five for meals we LOVE, fours are usually still pretty good.  And this was only okay.  Changes I made: left out the flour step, but I did season the chicken pretty well.  Cut the vinegar in the sauce in half, but marinated the chicken in some beforehand.  Hmm, other than that, I followed the recipe.  So I guess that's all.  Till next time!

I really loved this recipe. I found the sauce to be wonderful. However, if you don't like Balsamic Vinegar, then this recipe is not for you. Also, I used canned mushrooms instead of fresh and found the recipe to still be great. Will definitely make again.

Although I love the taste of balsamic vinegar , it didn't work in this dish.  The vinegar overpowered the dish instead of adding a flavor to it.

I already had cooked chx breasts so I just made the sauce and it was delicous; however, I had to triple it b/c when I let it reduce I was left with a paste (albeit a yummy paste).  This is truly gourmet at home.  Served over fettucine noodles, but will try over garlic mashed potatoes next time.

I took the advice of some of the other reviews and added more garlic, don't think the bay leaf and thyme help any I will leave it out next time. My husband enjoyed this very much, he is a chef and I hardly ever cook, he went back for seconds!  Will definitly cook again.

Good but not great.  Served over egg noodles.  Definitely make twice the sauce.  Chicken tasted great.

This was SO VERY WONDERFUL!!!! I just made it tonight and I can't wait to use it for special company - it was THAT good, tender, moist, and flavorful!!!  I didn't have mushrooms on hand but I used a 1/2 of an onion, sliced into rings, instead.  The only other change was adding about a tablespoon of corn meal to the flour mixture before dredging the chicken in it.  
Thanks so much - LOVED IT!!!

Great simple recipe! I took the other reviewer's suggestions and omitted the flour. After I reduced the liquid, I added two cans of brown gravy to make the vinegar taste a little more subtle and to stretch out the sauce. Results were very tasty! I served the chicken with egg noodles and fresh green beans. The whole family loved it. Thanks!

Mmmm, this is very easy and very good.  However, it is very similar to another recipe from this site which also calls for diced tomatoes and I like the flavor and texture that they add, so I would probably stick to that one.  But this is good...

Amazing!!! I doubled the chicken broth to cut down on the balsamic vinegar taste and served with side of egg noodles. The only thing I will I will do differently is to double or possibly triple the sauce next time (was great over the noodles).

My husband loved these.  I agree that I will not do the chicken in flour the next time I make this recipie, it became slimy and peeled off. I may use some italian bread crumbs instead next time.  The taste was fantastic.  I served it with Focacia Bread which was great with the sauce.

Very easy to make and tasted pretty good.  Added extra liquid for more sauce, but didn't increase the balsamic vinegar proportionally.  Still tasted the vinegar pretty strongly.  Thought maybe next time to saute the mushrooms first and to flatten the chicken breasts so the flavor would soak through more.

Very tasty and simple to make. I followed the recipe and found the proportions to be quite good. Nicely tangy, but not as vinegary as I thought it might be. I skipped the flour dredge and had plenty of sauce, maybe because I only had 3 breasts. Definately make rice, potatoes or pasta to soak up the delicious sauce, you won't want to waste it.

AMAZING. Def a keeper. I cut my chicken into strips & leme tell ya, it went SO fast. Its a gourmet tasting dish! Hubby was quite impressed! Its better the 2nd day as all the flavors really penetrate the chicken. Perfect w/a good bottle of white wine. I made herb roasted new potatoes w/this dish & it was perfect. Thank you SO much!

The flavor of the chicken was really great.  Somehow the "dredging of the flour" didn't turn out quite right.  Next time i will pass over that step.  Yum!!

This was wonderful!!! I have a new favorite way of preparing boneless, skinless chicken breasts. The only thing I did different was I marinated the chicken in a little balsamic vinegar and olive oil for about an hour before cooking. I also was out of thyme so I substited a pinch of mixed dried herbs that I had. I was afraid that the garlic would burn if I added it when I flipped the chicken so I added it just about a minute before I added the liquid. I most definitely will be making this again, probably very soon.

I thought this was a pretty impressive dish considering the ease of preparation.  Also, I liked that it's made with ingredients I always have on hand.  Was thinking of trying this with marsala wine in place of the vinegar....We had it with garlic mashed potatoes and a bagged spinach sald for an effortless but yummy meal!

I thought this was just okay, but will probably make again since my husband likes it. I had to give it 4 stars, since I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I followed the advice of other reviewers and cut the balsamic in half. I think it might have been more flavorful if I had kept the recipe as-is. The chicken was moist, and the mushrooms were the best part (in my opinion).

This was delicious!  Very easy to make and if you love balsamic vinegar as I do, you'll love this.  A definite repeat and a keeper!  Thanks Colleen!

This recipe is an all-around winner.  I followed the other reviews and used a little more than half the balsamic vinegar called for and it was excellent.  I loved that it had a very "gourmet" flavor as well as appearance and it was very easy to make.  If you want to impress your guest, this is the recipe!
