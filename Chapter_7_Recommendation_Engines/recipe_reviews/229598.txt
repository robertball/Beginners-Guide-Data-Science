I used spicy V-8 juice and my horseradish is "extra hot," so I didn't add the hot sauce...heat level was just perfect for me.  This is good, but I must admit it's not my favorite recipe on this site.  Thanks KELLYJELLO for a nice drink on a Friday evening.

This is great, but I get a bit crazy by rimming the glass with a bit of sea salt.  Just rim the glass with either the bloody Mary mix, or with the lemon juice and dip into a bit of salt on a plate or napkin.  You can also ramp up the garnish, as I don't care for celery stalks.  I use 1 or 2 olives, a piece of bacon or small spiced sausage, and a piece of dill pickle.  Especially good with a really spicy bloody Mary mix.
