4 stars only because I'm used to the taste of regular powdered sugar frosting.  Otherwise, this is a great Splenda substitute!

I make a lot of things with splenda, but if this is what "normal" splenda frosting should taste like, I will be leaving my cakes un-frosted. I am an experienced chef and baker and this tasted like flour with the aftertaste of aspertame. I know that I cooked it properly and it turned out beautiful, but it tasted bitter ....even after adding 2 cups of powdered sugar to try and save the stick of butter that I lost.

It turned out a little lumpy...maybe I didn't add the flour correctly...I don't know.  But it has a nice texture and tastes like chocolate pudding.

you must cook this for awhile to avoid the raw flour taste...however, properly rendered, this icing is delicious!

Very easy to make and my Dad who is a big sweet eater, loved it very much. My kids do not even notice the difference at all.
