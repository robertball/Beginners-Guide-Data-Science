The cake is good and decent, that's for sure - because it has the fairly standard characteristics you'd expect from the typical, embellished cake mix.  Dark, rich and moist.  But sometimes simple is best and this one should have kept it simple - it's almost as though the recipe tried too hard to be great when it didn't have to. We've got rum, raspberry, chocolate and apple flavors - rather than complementing each other to create something uniquely delicious, they compete with each other to result in something just a little off- putting.  Apple juice?  Totally irrelevant here.  Don't even know it's there.  Chocolate and rum - good. Chocolate and raspberry - also good.  Chocolate, apple, rum and raspberry?  Not so good. Pick a flavor - the rum, perhaps, OR the raspberry, and this would have been far better.

This is a great recipe.  I made it for a dinner party and everyone loved it!  It was a huge success.  It's not the healthiest, but if your gonna eat chocolate anyway, go for it, because this one is good.  Nice and moist, chocolately, sweet berry taste.  I also took fresh raspberries and peaches and made a small fruit salad that we ate with the cake.  Yum yum!

I would recommend this recipe to absolutely anyone! I made this for a party last week and everybody came back for seconds, a few even wanted thirds! (Yes, one of them was me). Probably the only chocolate cake I will ever make again!
THANKS! :P

I have made this recipe many times for family gatherings around the holidays and it ALWAYS gets rave reviews.  There are never any leftovers.  Absolutely excellent recipe.

This was a pretty good recipe. First off I didn't have the right pan so we just used a 13x9 inch pan. It worked just fine but I can definatly see how this would of been beautiful if I did have the right pan. My nephew wanted to bake something for the first time and he came across this and wanted to try it, he made the entire thing himself and it was very easy to make. We only put the raspberry glaze on half the cake b/c a few people didn't even want to try it when they heard there was a raspberry glaze BUT I made everyone try a small piece w/ the glaze and everyone liked it including my picky one... It's not an overwhelming raspberry taste, it actually goes well w/ the choc glaze. If I didn't tell anyone it was on there no one would of noticed. My nephew even poked holes in the cake where the glaze was so the glaze would seep into the cake alittle. He LOVED this recipe! A few people thought it tasted good but was alittle dry... You definatly need a big glass of milk w/ it. We'll definatly be making this again as soon as I buy the right kind of pan! THANKS!

The cake and glaze tasted good, but even though I followed the recipe exactly and let the glazes cool before I put them on, they both melted into a pool underneath the cake and never quite hardened.
