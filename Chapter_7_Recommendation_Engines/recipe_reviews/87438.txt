I LOVED THIS DISH!!  So did my husband, 5 year old & 2 year old.  I did modify a few things.  I sauteed the onions and then browned the chops in the same pan w/ the oinions still in it.  Then I braised the chops w/ onions in about a cup of chicken broth for maybe 30 minutes.  I removed the chops and reduced the chicken broth by about half.  Then I added the tomatoes, vinegar and spices.  Topped w/ feta and the house feel silent while we devoured our dinner.  I am going to try this w/ chicken next time.  And then make it again, and again and again!!!

My, my, my...this was sooooo good! The only thing I changed was, I used a 28oz can of diced tomatoes. I would change nothing else, it was absolutely wonderful! I lie...I did change it, I also tried it with chicken thighs...every bit as good as the pork. The feta cheese really added zip. Made it for company, they took home the recipe....made it for my married children and spouses...and both daughters have made it at home, and I only found the recipe 3 weeks ago! Just one other thing...I used white balsamic the first time (to keep the colour more pleasing), was very good, however, it had just a little more spunk with the dark version.  For those of you who find pork chops too dry, try pork shoulder steak...I rarely use chops and find the pork steak is always more moist and flavourful.

OMG!  This was fantastic!  I did use fresh basil and the only other change I made was that I browned the pork chops on both sides first and put them in the oven until they reached 140 degrees.  In the meantime, I continued on with the recipe.  Wow! I will make this again...and again...again!

I added extra balsamic vinegar, and after cooking the chops, I put them into a casserole dish, topped them with the tomato mixture, covered it, and baked it at 300 degrees for 30 minutes (to allow my other sides to get ready). Everyone loved the meal.

Great flavors!  The tomatoes add just the right amount of 'juiciness'.  Don't worry if you can't find the yellow ones...just increase the amount of red ones and it will be fine!  Today's pork is quite lean and can turn out dry but I find if I cook it on a bit lower heat and cover it (after its browned nicely on both sides) that it turns out yummy.    This recipe will be added to my list!

This recipe was delicious, but I will be making it with chicken from now on.  We're not huge pork fans, but that's not the recipe's fault!  I added a few capers to the mix, and I loved how the tomatoes tasted after they were cooked--warm, savory/sweet, and fabulous.  Thanks for a keeper!

WOW! This is awesome! We LOVED this! This is a nice restaurant quality dish. We used 1 can of diced tomatoes, drained, instead of the grape tomatoes. We also served this up with a side of pasta that was tossed in olive oil. This was wonderful. Oh, one thing that we did was used basil and sundried tomato feta, just because I had it. It would have been awesome with plain feta. If you like spicy italian dishes you will love this! Thanks so much for sharing!

Same ingredients--different method.  S & P and garlic powder on chops. Brown quickly on high heat on both sides. Place in a baking dish.  Brown onion in same skillet then add tomatoes, basil and garlic to heat through and then place in top of chops.  Cover and bake at 300 for 30 min.  Sprinkle with balsamic vinegar and top with feta to serve. Keeps the chops very moist.  Just delicious.

What an excellent dish! I pan seared really thick pork chops and then baked them to maximize tenderness and flavor. Every bite was delicious!

Absolutely delicious.  I too seared thick pork chops and then baked them in the oven to keep them moist.  A gourmet dish and so easy to make.

This one is hard to screw up, I'd thought I had overcooked the pork but it was still moist & tender, you could get away with half an onion though as we had lots leftover after the fact. I really enjoyed it and especially liked the Feta.  My honey didn't care for the Feta but other than that he liked it and said he would enjoy having it for dinner again.

Terrific recipe! I substituted both the red and yellow grape tomatoes for a 14.5 oz. can of organic diced tomatoes. My chops were all of 1" thick and I seasoned and browned both sides in the pan first and then covered and cooked them on medium until tender. Removed them from the pan and deglazed the pan beautifully with the diced tomatoes, garlic and basil. Added in the balsamic vinegar, salt and pepper and topped off the chops with the carmelized onions and the tomato mixture, sprinkled with feta cheese for the finale. These were A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!! A great, new way to serve pork chops. Incredibly moist, tender and juicy. Loved the feta, it just complimented all of the other flavors and blended oh so well. I am anxious to try with chicken as well. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe ~

The first time I made this, I thought it was great, but my husband thought the pork was too bland.  So, the second time I made it, I rubbed both sides of the pork with a mixture of flour, salt, pepper, onion powder, and oregano.  I browned the chops on both sides, then braised them in chicken broth with a splash of balsamic vinegar for about 20 minutes.  The chops came out very moist and flavorful.  Once I removed the chops from the pan, I reduced the chicken broth by about half, then proceeded with the recipe as written.  This time, the recipe got hubby's thumbs-up!  We left out the feta from personal preference, and I used Roma tomatoes because that's what I had on hand.  It would probably be even better in the summer, with cherry tomatoes fresh from the garden!

This was FANTASTIC!! I browned the pork and then set it in the oven at 375 to finish cooking. While that was going, I did the onions, tomatoes, garlic and basil. I used a can of diced tomatoes mostly drained, rather than fresh, and fresh basil rather than dried. Followed other directions, otherwise, and thoroughly enjoyed! I served with a side of whole wheat penne pasta (which was also fanstastic topped with leftover onion mixture). I will be making this again with chicken and possibly just as a pasta dish. Thanks!!

Made this tonight, excellent. I did marinate for 45 minutes. Used garlic rosemary seasoning and added basil.Seared pork chops cooked until almost done then arranged the cooked onions tomatoes and feta on top then placed in a 300 degree toaster oven while I made pan gravy and mashed potatoes. Yummy! Will fix again. Noce enough for company also. Used plum tomatoes.

This was very tasty!! I was looking for a recipe to use up some leftover feta, and this one appealed to me because it didn't call for a lot of "processed" ingredients. This really was very simple - the only prep required was on the onion and tomatoes.  I did follow the advice of an earlier reviewer who suggested braising the onion and chops in chicken broth - I didn't want to overbrown the chops while trying to cook the center.  If you are going to use the broth, you may want to omit salting the chops before browing as mine were a little on the salty side.

Yum, Yum, Yum...........nothing to not like about this recipe.   I was so pleased with this dinner.  The pork loin browned up nicely, onions and tomatoes were delicious cooked in the balsamic vinegar, and the feta cheese was outstanding as the final ingredient.  This will most definitely be in our rotating dinner menu.

Made this last week to RAVE reviews!  It is like a bruschetta pork chop, delicious! The ONLY thing I changed was that I did add a can of stewed tomatoes to the recipe because I was slow cooking it in the oven and didn't want to run out of fluids while I was out of the house.  It provided for lots of sauce which we all loved!  definite keeper for me!

This is a simple, wonderful, gourmet-type recipe. Since grape tomatoes are pricey, I coursely chop "on the vine" tomatoes and lightly rinse them in preparation to add to the recipe. The flavors of basil, tomato, onion with the garlic and balsamic vinegar blend wonderfully well and the feta cheese just adds that special extra touch. Thanks for this delight!!

Nice presentation,tender meat with good blend of flavors. I had garlic herb Feta in the house so i used that and as one of the reviewers did, I sauteed the chops to brown them, removed them to a casserole, finished the topping as directed and baked the whole thing covered for 20 min at 350 until meat thermometer 140+. I added the cheese when I removed the casserole dish from the oven.  I enjoyed the pork but my husband prefers poultry so will try with chicken or turkey breast next time! Thanks so much

for a different variation substitute the pork with a pound of large shrimp, double the olive oil and vinegar and toss with bow tie pasta.

Can you say YUM?  This recipe is delicious.  This is the first time I've cooked pork chops and actually liked it. I usually refrain from eating pork because of its blandness but this recipe makes the pork very flavorful.  Will definitely use again.

This recipe was delicious!  I pretty much made it as written excepth that I used white wine vinegar in place of balsamic and that is only because I was out of balsamic.  Also I couldn't find any yellow grape tomatoes so I just used a full pint of the red.  Other than those two things, I followed the written recipe.  I served over a bed of brown rice and a side spinach salad.  I will definitely be making this again.  Thank you!

Fabulous flavor!  Made a few changes: Added 1T. of sugar to the tomatoes due to winter tomatoes lacking flavor.  Used 3 T. of fresh basil, not dried.  And grilled a pork tenderloin instead of the chops.  I also added a little Ken's Steakhouse creamy balsamic dressing.  Severed over angel hair pasta!  Everyone LOVED it!  Will make again!

We really, really liked this dish!  The only thing I changed was using boneless, skinless chicken breasts instead of the pork loin chops.  Thats just because we prefer chicken, otherwise followed recipe exactly, and it was amazing!

Like some others, I used a can of diced tomatoes to make it a little cheaper and quicker, and they came out great.  My fiance and I both loved them.

AMAZING!  I cheated and had my husband grill the pork, but other than that. followed the recipe exactly.  It was so juicy and the tomato mixture on top is so flavorful!  I served this with garlic bread and grilled asparagus spears.  Will definitely make this again!  FYI...the pork is 7 pts on WW Points Plus...

I prepared this the same way as described, except instead of pork i used thin chicken breasts, which i dipped in egg and then italian bread crumbs. Also instead of fresh tomatoes i used canned dice petite tomatoes since that's what I had. Still came out delicious!
This recipe is delicious with chicken!!

This was super easy and very tasty! I didn't have cherry tomatoes so I used canned diced tomatoes and it turned out yummy. Make sure you drain well! Can't wait to try with summer time tomatoes!

Really yummy! I cooked it almost the exact same way except for: kept onions in the pan; added chicken broth throughout the cooking; added capers with tomato and covered it for the last 4 minutes to cook the pork. Served with garlic mash although I think with a nice green salad or green vege, this can be a great summer supper! Thanks!

My husband usually always finds something wrong or something that could be done better with everything I cook. (Drives me insane) He told me 3 times how good this was and called one of his good friends to tell him how good dinner was. I thought I had balsamic vinegar and didn't, substituted red wine vinegar and it was really good. Will cook again.

Wonderful! What a great amount of taste with a minimum of work. I had to use wimpy 1/2" bone-in pork chops (it was all I had) but this made them gourmet! The balsamic blended so well with the garlic, onion and tomatoes. And the feta on top was like icing on the cake! I followed the recipe with no substitutions except the size of chop and I didn't have any yellow tomatoes - I'm sure it would've been even better with those two things. The kids ate theirs plain but my pork-chop-hating husband wolfed it down. This definitely goes into the rotation. Bravo!

WOW!!!! The is a great dish!!!! I cooked the pork chops over very low heat to make sure they are cooked all the way through, and put a piece of foil over after cooking them, it will help keep them moist.

I liked this recipe & the ingredients were on the money. Allthough I did my own take on it. I browned the chops in the 1tbsp of olive oil on both sides. 4 minutes on both sides, then removed them & added the rest of the ingredients in the same pan & simmered for 10 minutes. If theres too much reduction add some chicken stock. Then I put the chops back in the pan, topped them with the cheese, covered them, & cooked for 10 more minutes

Great and easy!  I didn't have some of the ingredients, so I substituted.  Sliced tomato instead of grape, italian vinagrette dressing instead of the balsamic vinegar, parmesan cheese instead of feta.  I think the real ingredients would make it better but this was fantastic and so easy to make.

I would give this a 4.5.  Interesting, easy change for pork chops.  Definitely don't skip the feta--it balances the tomatoes/onions perfectly.

Im not a big pork fan but this was delicious. I browned the pork in the pans with the browned onions, then put in a casserole.  After preparing tomatoes, I put on top of pork and baked.  The sauce comes out great.

Absolutely amazing! Because of the sauce that you add at the end, the pork will be extra moist! We don't like feta so we substituted a little bit of monterrey jack cheese shredded and it tasted delicious!

Amazing! The only thing I did differently was used a whole pint of red tomatoes instead of using half yellow.  Also, I'm not sure how I forgot the balsamic vinegar, but I did. I will be sure to add next time, but it was still delicious without. Served with rice and green beans and it was a hit!

I often find that pork chops are tough and lack flavor, so I used this recipe as a base, added/ changed some things; Used fresh creole tomatoes, twice as much garlic, and fresh basil(1/4 cup).  I used a very large onion, then left the onion in the skillet while the pork cooked, then added 1 cup  chicken bouillion, 3 cloves minced garlic,a tblspn of basalmic vinegar, 1/2 cup of water, and 1/2 cup of red wine to the skillet and cooked the chops on low/med for 1 hour to make them fork tender. Added the tomato, more garlic, and fresh basil to the sauce and cooked down for a few minutes- This gave the dish so much more flavor (I live in the South) and depth- My husband loved it!!  I also used reduced fat feta to top it.

My husband loved this recipe. I'm not a big pork chop fan mainly because I feel like I always make them too dry, but my husband disagrees. (He must have just acquired a taste for my overcooked chops!) Anyhow, I did try this and the topping was excellent. The feta and pork went really well together. When I make this again and I will, I might try  a chicken version for me.

This was very good, leftovers are better as the flavors have a chance to mingle. I doubled the recipe. My husband and I work strange hours and I like to have food prepared, all he has to do is take it out of the freezer and warm up in microwave and he is good to go. Couldn't find yellow tomatoes, just used all red tomatoes.
Also added some mushrooms and a package of frozen chopped spinach.
Was suprized at the mildness of the Feta cheese, It was very good, thought it would have more kick.
Thanks for a great recipe.

This was excellent and very easy to make.  To simplify, I cooked pork chops in one skillet and "topping" in another skillet at the same time.  My husband and I loved it!  The feta is a nice touch.  This would be great with chicken too!

This was great! My husband said it was worth 6 stars. I used Chicken, not pork chops and an Italian mix of herbs. Thanks!

This was very good!  Instead of pork loin chops, I tried this using pork tenderloin.  We grilled it whole rather than using a skillet.  My store didn’t have yellow grape tomatoes, so I used a yellow on-the-vine tomato, seeded and chopped, along with the red grape tomatoes.  I can tell you that the yellow tomato didn’t hold up nearly as well as the grape tomato, so next time I will use all red grape tomatoes.  I did think the balsamic flavor needed to be boosted, so I served this with a balsamic glaze for drizzling.

Amazing flavors from the tomato and balsamic!  Paired nicely with the meaty pork chop.

This recipe was great! My husband and I added chicken broth and let it braise for 30 minutes instructed by one of the reviewers and it was awesome! We forgot the feta cheese but it was great tasting all the same. My kids 8 and 2 ate everything! No leftovers!

I did everything except the grapes (as the ones in the store were horrible) and it was exceptional. We practically licked the plate clean! All these fabulous recipes is making me very popular and my family and friends are volunteering to be my guinea pigs whenever I want to try something new! Thanks!

Didn't change a thing and it was really good. Had an elegant feel to it. The feta gave it a nice zing to the sweet pop of the tomato... Yummy!

I don't review often, but this was amazing! I did substitute the salt and pepper for my greek seasoning I like, but other than that I made it as is and everyone gobbled it up. This will be added into my meal plans! YumYumYum

My hubby and I loved this dish!  I cooked it with a can of diced tomatoes instead of the grape tomatoes per the other reviews, and I used onion powder since I didn't have onions in the house.  Per another review, I put in the oven for 30 minutes at 250 degrees to keep it warm while I made the side dishes. The feta really makes it!

Braised meat in Chicken broth as I read in the reviews, Excellant! Used fresh basil and pressed fresh garlic for wonderful flavor. Can't wait to try this with chicken or bone in pork chops.

This was a very flavorful dish.  Even the insanely picky teen boy ate it, he cant stand tomatoes. The only thing I did different was I didn't use the feta, we just aren't feta people.

Rave reviews for this dish! I did make a few adjustments to suit my pantry and my family's palates:  Used three medium roma tomatoes (diced) instead of grape tomatoes, added 1 cup of torn spinach leaves, and added half of the feta cheese as spinach leaves wilted in the pan with the tomatoes, and then family added feta to their own taste as a final garnish.  I also omitted vinegar altogether...  Feta added exactly the right tanginess.  Great complement to pork!

I made this dish last night for a group of friends. Oh my gosh, it was amazing. Like another cook suggested, I prepared as suggested, then I put the meat in a 10 x 13 dish, put the onions, tomatoes, etc on top, covered and baked in oven for 30 minutes.  As I dished it out, I topped with feta cheese. This was truly a meal fit for a king!

A 5 star recipe! I'm always looking for new and different ways to cook porkchops, and this was perfect.  I followed recipe exactly to a "T", except I didn't have the yellow grape tomatoes so I used a full pint of the red and instead of using plain Feta I used Feta w/ basil and tomato.  One of the things I like about this recipe is that the same pan is used in each step, thereby incorporating layers of flavor throughout.  At the end, the tomatoes act as a deglazing agent because it picks up all the brown spots from the pan, therefore picking up even MORE flavor. This is a winner for sure.  I felt this was best served over angel hair, and it was perfect! I 'nested' a little bit of angel hair (tossed with a bit of olive oil and butter) and layed the chop down on it and placed the mixture on that.  The tomatoe mixture goes perfectly w/ the angel hair as well.  Thanks for an awesome recipe, as I will be making this again!

WONDERFUL! A family favorite. I am impressed with how easy and tasty this recipe was. I made this for a guest that is quite a picky gourmet and she loved it. I used a tbs of minced garlic to save time and only red tomatoes, saving a few for the salad. I served the chops next to a mixed greens salad with fresh tomato and cucumber. I also used feta with herbs and tomato, will try one with sun dried tomato next time. I sometimes use a can of diced and seasoned tomato if I don’t have fresh ones on hand. This is also very good with chicken, I do it at least once a month!

This just didn't work for me.  I really liked the tomato sauce, I like pork chops, and I love feta, but I don't think they worked well together.  I would use the sauce again on chicken with mozzarella for a chicken parmesan.

Very good, made exactly as described.  I really loved the flavor of the onions, think next time I will add a bit more onions, hubby said this was a definite keeper.

Very, very good and healthy. I love the use of garlic, tomato and olive oil. They are great ingredients for your arteries! I served this over romaine and green leaf lettuce and it was filling and sooo good. I omitted the yellow tomato and just went with red, it was great! My husband liked it too and he is very picky.

I thought this turned out great. I used fresh tomato instead of the cherry tomatoes because that is what I had on hand. This would be delicious with chicken as well. Next time, instead of feta I am going to try goat cheese. The sauce would be wonderful on pasta as well. Glad I tried this!

This recipe is great and taste wonderful. I also breaded the pork chops which i thought made it taste even better.  I even used pork cutlets instead of thick pork chops

I made this with chicken instead of pork.  It is MARVELOUS!  I've served it for company twice now.  I think I like it best over angel hair pasta.  I also think the sauce could be great as pasta sauce.  I have been adding some canned pureed tomatoes to the sauce because I like things saucy.

Great recipe!

It was a nice change; family liked it.  Used canned grilled tomatoes instead of fresh;  worked fine.  Served with augratin potatoes and salad.

Very tasty.  I substituted chicken breast that I pounded to 1/4".  I also added fresh tomatoes as suggested and the basil and garlic feta.  I thought the balsamic vinegar was slightly strong.  I will go a bit lighter next time.

This was fantastic.  My husband is not a HUGE tomato fan but said it was a keeper.  I followed the recipe exactly (except I added more garlic) and loved the balsamic and feta- great combinations.  I would recommend it.

This was a great recipe.  Easy to do and everyone in my family loved it.  I used canned diced tomatoes and added mushrooms too.  It was as good on the crusty bread as it was on the chops!

This  one of the best recipes I've ever made!  It was simple and so flavorful.  I put the pork chops in the oven in a stone baker after I browned them to finish cooking them.  I would not change one single ingredient.

I don't write a lot of reviews, but this was really excellent. I added a bag of fresh spinach when I put in the cherry tomatoes and it was a great one-dish meal for our family. Lots of flavor, juicy pork, and my husband raved about it.

This had pretty good flavors. We did everything as written but covered the skillet while the pork was cooking to try to keep it more moist-and it seemed to work. We left out the feta and used all red cherry tomatoes.

I really liked this dish and unbelievably my picky 6 year old liked it too.  My husband did not like it as he doesnt like big pieces of tomato and didn't like the feta on top so thats why only 4 stars.  I would definatley make this again for myself and my children maybe on a night when my husband isn't home :-) !

This dish was amazing!  So many flavors with so little ingredients.  The only thing I changed was the way I did the garlic.  I always use a garlic press.

Yum!!  I did change it up a bit: seared the pork chops and then baked everything.  Also, I used canned diced tomatoes, fresh basil and added a bit more balsamic.

My husband gave me a high-five after his first bite, followed by a hand shake!  It's the first meal I've made that he would give a total "5-star" rating to, and I didn't even use any balsamic vinegar!  I'd have to give it a 5 as well.  We're definitely making this meal again!

This is an awesome recipe. As long as you prep everything before you start cooking it's super easy to make. Great flavor but I recommend boneless porkchops for this recipe.

I was very disappointed. The balsamic vinegar was way too sweet and it gave the dish an unpleasant color. The recipe calls for thinly sliced onions but they need to be sliced thicker. I did like the use of the tomatoes, as I had a lot leftover that needed to be used and feta is a family favorite.

I just made this for my sister's family and we loved it. I was leery about using the strong feta cheese since I am not a huge fan, but it was tamed by the other ingredients. This will definitely become a staple dish in my house!

Tasty way to eat otherwise boring porkchop! Would be great with chicken also. Loved the sweetness of the tomatoes with the saltiness of the feta and the balsamic rounded everything out!

This was so delicious! The only thing I did a bit differently was to follow one reviewers advice to braise the chops in a cup of chicken broth after browning. I will definitely make this again. It's a winner!!

Tried this for supper tonight, turned out well, i followed what others did that is is seared chops and put into a cassarole dish and finished in the oven for 1/2 an hour, but next time I will increase the heat a touch, hubby commented that he liked the flavours a lot, can hardly wait to reheat tomorrow and try over some oven baked potato fries and make a poutine type supper. Thanks for this tasty dish, will add to my regular favorites!

This was fantastic!  The flavors were perfect together!  My pork chops were a little thick, next time I will use 1" chops.  I think that this would be absolutely wonderful on chicken or even fish!

AWESOME!  My daughter and I are hooked!  We had this last night then again tonight.  I only had red cherry tomatoes, didn't have basil and used red wine vinegar instead of balsamic.  Great flavor!  Yummy!

Loved it!  I added homemade salsa instead of fresh tomatoes since it's the middle of winter and there aren't any local areas to get fresh tomatoes.  I also opted out of the cheese to cut down on calories, but added fresh mozzarella to my husband's plate; he referred to it as pizza on top of a pork chop.

9-21-11: The sauce has an interesting taste.
8-5-12: Second time through, used more tomatoes of both kinds. Both of us thought it was good.

An excellent way to use the fresh tomatoes and basil that are in season right now.  I will be putting a star on this recipe card as a reminder of the delicious way to cook pork chops.

Awesome. Such a pretty dish, as well. Served with asparagus that was sauteed with garlic and balsamic vinegar, with a little Parmesan on top.

Yum, yum!  My only caution is to use thick-cut chops and work quickly.  It's really easy to overcook the chops.

Very good!  I didn't worry about separating the onion/tomato mixture from the chops. I threw in all of that when the chops were about half done and it came out great. I melted the cheese on top at the end before removing from the pan.

Wonderful with chicken instead of pork, if you have it use fresh basil (abt 1/4 cup) chopped. Grape tomatoes weren't missed; we substituted a large whole diced tomato and only used half the suggested amount of feta. Perfect!

Very good!  The balsamic was perfect with the tomatoes and sauteed onions!  Next time I will use fresh basil though...I think it would make the recipe even more delicious!

YUMMY!  The only thing I did to change the recipe was to use the fresh basil in the garden-

So simple and little time but big on flavor. This dish is served up a couples times a month at my home. I found that searing thick chops in O oil in a hot cast iron skillet for 5 minutes on each side and baking covered for one hour makes for a more flavorful chop. Then just finish the dish in the skillet on stove top as directed.

This was fantastic! All of the flavors blend very well together. The directions didn't instruct how long to cook the chops, so after researching I found that for thick chops 4-5 minutes per side was perfect.  I did use a meat thermometer to make sure it reached 140 degrees. This recipe really does only take about half an hour, so it's a great quick meal.

I am not a pork chop fan but this recipe is an exception!  Unfortunately, we didn't have feta but even without it, the topping was delicious.  I have plans to use it again with baked chicken breasts.

Mmmmmmm this was really good! I added a sliver of butter to the olive oil before cooking the 'sauce' and it seemed to add an extra layer of taste...I also made sure not to cook the pork too long in the skillet, not as tasty if it's too tough! Hubby said "Please make this one again" which he hasn't said for awhile...easy to do, and will probably save this recipe if we have friends over and don't know what to serve!

This recipe is Wonderful! I have a fear of cooking pork chops because they always come out so dry for me. So, I followed some of the other reviews and baked it in the oven for the last 20 minutes. It came out very moist and the mixture on top was fabulous. I am excited to make this again.

Such an easy, elegant dish.  My family really enjoyed this pork meal.  The flavors are great together.  I prepared parmesian couscous with it the last time and the mild couscous accompanied the stronger fresh flavors of the meat dish

This was a delicious recipe - easy to prepare, and a unique flavour. I wasn't able to find yellow grape tomatoes, so used only red. I served with jasmine rice and green beans - so the colour wasn't missed. I'll be making this recipe again.

"You should open a restaurant, babe!" is what my husband's response was when he took his first bite. I'm normally not much of a cook at all, but this dish makes it seem like I know what I'm doing. I used fresh chopped basil (3 TBSP) and basil-flavored olive oil; otherwise followed recipe as is. It wound up being finished a little before I could serve it, so I let the pork chops sit back in the hot pan with the topping for 10 or 15 minutes. This turned out to be a nice way to get the pork hot again, as well as to let it soak up some of the juices and be even more moist.  YUM!  Will certainly make often in our home.  I served with candied carrots from this site, which we liked. I think rice or angel hair pasta would've been nice, too, with the juices from the topping.

This was a very good healthy dish. We made exactly as written apart from broiling the chops instead of frying. The balsamic vinegar adds a subtle depth without making the dish taste "vinegary". Served with lightly steamed zucchini and baked potatoes. Would like to try the wine idea next time!

Nice flavor, but I wish I'd subbed dry white wine for the balsamic vinegar (we didn't care for the sweetness of the vinegar).  I used pork tenderloin medallions instead of chops.

This recipe was delicious! The only thing I did differently was after removing the pork from the pan, instead of adding more oil, I added some white wine which gave the whole dish an even more sophisticated taste, and reduced the fat content. I also left out the feta to keep down the fat. Wonderful dish!

This is an excellent recipe!  I've already cooked it three times. I made a few slight modifications but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly as stated.  I didn't use so much oil, instead I cooked the pork chops for a few minutes on each side in the same skillet which had been used for the onions.  While the meet was cooking I added balsamic vinegar and let it cook until evaporated.  Then I proceeded to follow the recipe.  I also added Italian powder mix (to taste) and at the end of cooking time, I added the feta cheese and let it cook down a bit before serving.  I will definitely be making this again and again!

Can I just say how much I love Allrecipes.com?  Where else can I search for a recipe that contains three ingredients that I wish to use for dinner and come up with something that everybody loves?  This was very very yummy - like many other reviewers I used all red tomatoes, but as soon as our yellow tomatoes come in I'll make it with 1/2 and 1/2 as directed.  Thanks for the keeper!

This was so delicious, the only thing I did differently was after browning the onions and garlic, I added chicken broth and purple basil from my garden, grilled the chops then when chops were done and warming I added heavy cream to make a sauce and poured it over the chops, so so good.

This one's a keeper!  I used a separate skillet for the onions and pork chops.  Then added the onions to the pan with the pork chops.   Next time I will drain the pork chops first for a more intense flavor.  I simmered a bit longer on low heat while preparing the side dishes.  My wife and I loved it!

I morphed this a little bit and it was do delicious!  I mixed together crumbled feta, panko bread crumbs, melted butter, parsley flakes, and chopped garlic. After pan frying the chops I pressed the mixture on top of the chops and broiled them to make them crusted.  For the mixture in this recipe, I used regular chopped up tomato, I also added some shredded cabbage that I had leftover, and I used raspberry blush balsamic vinaigrette.  The hint of raspberry was perfect with the feta and the pork.

Made this dish as a first real meal I have ever made. (I'm 14) Took a few suggestions from other reviewers. Browned the chops, put them in a baking dish and cooked them at 300 for 30 minutes. Replaced the fresh tomatoes with canned diced and sauted them with the onions, garlic and vinegar. Topped the porkchops with the saute mix and cooked for another 20 minutes. Took a bit longer then I thought to cook them but overall dish was amazing. Served them with alfredo noodles, italian veggies and rolls. Turned out great.

One thing i did before creating the sauce was to reduce the balsamic, by letting it simmer over medium heat for 15 mins, to keep the pork more juicy.

This was Amazing!  I halved the recipe and subbed a 14oz can of tomatoes for the fresh tomatoes. So quick and easy and tastes wonderful.  I will definitely be making this again.

Unbelievable how good this is!  You need to make sure to cook the pork chops correctly- get a good browning on each side.  I followed the recipe  almost exactly as is written (maybe added more garlic, and used lots of fresh basil).  So good and so simple!

I substituted sweet red wine instead of the balsamic vinegar and it was delicious. I also left out the feta cheese because I didn't have any but it was still so good! This can be used in the Paleo diet if you leave out the cheese.

I did not follow the exact measurements for this recipe, after my adjustments it was a 5 star recipe for sure. I took all the listed ingredients and just made it to taste (basically, more garlic, more basil, more feta, also added paprika).  Instead of dried basil I used fresh basil and I think that is a really important key to making this recipe truly outstanding. The flavor combination comes off bright, fresh and super flavorful. We had REALLY thick pork chops so we seared them over high heat in the frying pan and then finished them in the oven. Didn't taste the balsamic much, so might increase that just a tad next time but everyone really loved this so there definitely WILL be a next time!

Very good.  I did not have grape tomatoes on hand so I just chopped up some slicing tomatoes, worked fine.  My family doesn't care much for balsamic vinegar so I used very little of it and supplemented with some red wine vinegar and some white cooking wine.  Also sprinkled on a scant 1/4 tsp of sugar to cut the sharpness.  After the tomatoes were done I put the chops back in the pan and topped with veggies and feta.  Then let it simmer a few minutes to get the chops back up to temp and melt the feta.

This was ridiculously good.  I also finished the chops off in the oven smothered with the tomato mixture.  If you're trying to cut calories, this dish is so rich I think it would do just fine without the feta.  My husband said this is now his favorite dish!

So delicious.  Per another reviewer's comment, I used a 28oz can of dice tomatoes because I didn't have fresh on hand.  I also added some oregano and crushed red pepper flakes.  SO good.

We love this.  It's our favorite way to eat pork chops now!  Generally what we do is grill the chops separately and then cook up the topping and ladle it on.  There's never enough.

I do not care much for pork, but this recipe was very good. I also used a can of tomatoes in lieu of the fresh tomatoes since I had none. Turned out wonderfully. Be sure that the pork chops are fully cooked when you serve it.

This dish is so delish and so easy.  Hubby and I decided we are definitely going to try it with chicken breasts as well!  We used garden fresh cherry tomatoes and yellow plum tomatoes, which were great.  The only thing I didn't care for was the skins on the tomatoes, so next time I might try it with chopped peeled tomato instead.

Nice Dish. Black olives would be a great addition to this dish. This is a unique and refreshing way to cook porkchops. It was easy to prepare and my family liked it. I did add extra feta cheese to enhance the zesty flavor.

This was fantastic. I used a deep skillet. I threw the fresh garlic in at the end with the onions and then put the seasoned pork chops in on top of that. After browning both side I threw a lid on the skillet and let everything cook for a little bit. I didn't have fresh tomatoes on hand so used a can of Italian diced (drained). I put that on top of the chops and then the feta cheese on top of that and threw the lid back on for about 5 minutes. My 4 year old and 10 year ate this like it was going out of style. My wife had the leftovers and raved about it. I passed the recipe to my boss who also gave it high marks.

MMM MMM Good! A very easy and great recipe for pork chops! This was a hit at my house! Moist and delicious!  I was out of feta cheese and basil, so I used parmesan and rosemary....still very good. Would like to try using the feta next time.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

We really enjoyed this dish.  I changed it up a little but the same concept.  Rubbed the pork loin steaks with olive oil and seasoned them well with garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper.  Once browned, I added the sliced onion and cooked about 3 minutes.  Added garlic and cooked another 30 seconds.  Then added a can of chopped diced tomatoes to deglaze the pan.  Covered and cooked over low heat for 30 minutes.  Topped steaks with fresh basil, feta and a few sliced kalamata olives.  The meat was so tender!  I decided to cook it this way because I find pork loin to be very dry.  Fantastic dish!  Served with asparagus and saffron rice.  My husband. who isn't wild about pork loin (dry), really loved it.

WOW!!! This was AWESOME!!!!! Made two chops for my bf and I Sunday night. I pretty much followed Lovecooking's directions to the letter, except for using all red cherry tomatoes (couldn't find yellow ones at any of my local grocery stores) and subbing 3 T chopped fresh basil for dried. Note: If you choose to use fresh basil, BE SURE to add it during the final step (i.e. when you stir in the balsamic and s/p), otherwise it will wilt and look unappetizing (which would be a rotten shame since the presentation of this dish is GORGEOUS). My only complaint (if you can call it that...) is that my pork was a tad dry, despite trying VERY carefully not to overcook it. My bf suggested brining, but unfortunately, we did not think of doing so until it was too late... lol. Oh well, next time I guess :) Served with Asparagus with Parmesan Crust by Kimber (thanks for the inspiration mommyluvs2cook!) and garlic mashed potatoes, this was a lovely dinner. It is certainly worthy of sharing with company and seasonally appropriate for summer entertaining! Thanks so much for sharing your recipe Lovecooking!!!

YUM!!  I sauted the onions and then added two pork chops to the same pan.  I sauteed for awhile and added two cloves of garlic and a chopped tomato. Cooked for about 5 mins and then added fresh chopped basil.  Added about 2T of balsamic vinegar, let it heat up and yum!!!  I will definitely be making this again!

Excellent! Excellent! Excellent! The topping is wonderful!!! My husband did the pork chops on the grill while I made the topping on the stove top. I have never really had a pork chop recipe I loved, until now.  This would be great served with a side of fresh asparagus. This topping would be good on almost anything. Can't wait to have it again!!!!

Yummmmm!! This is absolutely delicious. I salted and peppered the pork and dredged it in flour before searing in oil. I drained the oil and then took the advice of another reviewer and braised in 1 cup chicken broth for about thirty minutes. I also used roma tomatoes instead of the grape. They were excellent. When the broth reduced by half I added about 1/4 cup milk just to make it a tad creamy. Fresh Parsley on top of the feta and BAM. Delicious recipe. Gotta try it peeps.

This is delicious! Made for dinner tonight and followed the recipe exactly except I used fresh basil instead of dried. I used a thinner cut pork chop and it took about 3 minutes on each side to cook. My husband and kids loved it!

I followed this recipe for the most part and it turned out GREAT!  I did end up having to finish off the pork chops in the oven, but that's only because I had really thick pork chops.  My boyfriend was impressed as well - and he is the pickiest eater I know.  I will definitely be making this again, and again...

HUGE hit with my family.  What a delicious combination of flavors. I took the advice of other reviewers and used canned tomatoes since the fresh ones I'd bought died before I could cook them.  Grrr!  Actually, I'll definitely use  canned tomatoes again just to save money and make the recipe easier.  I also cooked on slightly lower heat and then loosely covered the pan after searing the chops on both sides. I think this helped keep in some of the moisture.  I'm not a big fan of pork chops so I'll probably try this again in the future with chicken.

Wonderful.  You can substitute regular tomatoes, but it is best if they are locally grown, in season, and therefore sweet.

Excellent recipe.  This looks very pretty on the plate, a great family meal but I would serve it to company as well.  Lots of intense flavor, especially from the tomatoes.  This one will be served often in our house!

I used a canned of diced tomatoes because I was too lazy to go out to the supermarket and buy the tomatoes listed on the recipe, but I followed the recipe exactly. It turned out pretty good. I would definitely make it again with diced tomatoes.

My husband I have been trying recipes from this website for over a year now. This is the FIRST one that we would absolutely make again and again. Wonderful bold flavors. The tomatoes and feta make the dish. My husband does not like either and he "tried" it for me. He ate every bit on his plate. I ate the leftovers at work the next day and 3 people at work went home with the recipe. Thank you for finally having a winner for us!

This is a great recipe.  I had thick chops so I after searing them I braised them in a cup of chicken broth for half an hour, then reduced the liquid and added the tomatoes, basil, and vinegar.  It seems so simple but it has a TON of flavor.  Yum!

The only thing I did differently, because my son-in-law does not like the tomatoes cooked, was to cut them in half with 2 Tablespoons of olive oil, 1 small clove of garlic and 1 Tablespoon fresh oregano (or 1/2 teaspoon dried)and let them marinate at room temperature while cooking the rest of the meal.  He loved it done this way.

I've been wanting to try this forever but it sounded a little bland, boy was I wrong! I seasoned the pork chops with lemon pepper seasoning, and simmered the chops covered with the mixture and they weren't tough at all. Served with rice that we topped with excess veggie mixture and that was tasty too! Definitely will make again.

This was good, nice flavor - but I agree with another reviewer; that it might be better with chicken.  I followed the recipe almost exactly and found the pork tough.  Next time I will try the many recommendations to sear then bake.  The one modification I did make was to add kalamata olives since it had a greek feel with feta, tomatoes, balsamic etc.  All in all though, a simple and quick meal with good flavor.

One of my favorites.  I usually use boneless chicken breasts and brown the onion right along with the meat.  I then add the balsamic vineager together with the chicken towards the end and add the tomatoes at the last minute, just to heat them through.  I serve the feta on the side so everyone can add their own amount on top.  Fresh basil is a must

I used canned diced tomatoes because that's what I had but it turned out great!  I cooked the pork and then threw it all together and cooked it for a half hour mainly because my husband was running late but it made the pork very tender and flavorful!

excellent combination of tastes.  I couldn't get yellow grape tomatoes but the dish worked regardless. Perhaps on the salty side... Iused sea salt to rub; only a small dash is necessary.

great topping - make sure to trim the meat really good.  I will try on chicken next time - my husband is not a big fan of pork.  As I was chopping the large onion, I thought it seemed like an awful lot of onions but I sauteed the onions extra long which made them very sweet.  Not too many onions at all.  I used only red grape tomatos (cheaper).  This really was great and easy.

Loved it!  First browned each side and then finished the baking in the oven.  Served over angel hair pasta - delicious!  Next time, I'm going to try adding other veggies like mushrooms, peppers, etc.  Finally a keeper!  And it was so easy!

I browned the chops in the onion and garlic, placed the chops in a baking dish, mixed everything else (except the feta) together in the skillet with the onion and garlic and then poured it over the chops. Baked covered in oven for about 30-40 minutes.  Very, very tasty.  I'm going to try it with chicken as my pork chops are never as tender as I would like them to be.  If my chops were more tender, I would have definitely given this 5 stars.

FANTASTIC! I used boneless pork cutlets and used only red grape tomatoes. You can also use 1 can of diced tomatoes (completely drained). I cooked the pork about 4-5 minutes on each side. We're talking restaurant quality food here! Will defnitely be making this again and again. Thanks for sharing.

This was awesome comfort food! I browned my chops on all sides, and then set them aside so I could saute the onions, tomatoes and garlic. After the onions were nice and soft I added some white wine to the pan to deglaze it and then put the pork chops back in. I braised them a mix of the wine and some water for about 30 minutes, and they were perfectly cooked. I served these with mashed potatoes, gravy and spinach. I'll be making this meal again, and may even use it the next time my in-laws are visiting.

I made this tonight for dinner and it was DELICIOUS.  Next time I'm going to try cooking the pork chops in a separate pan at the same time as the tomatoes, onions and garlic, as the pork dried out a little bit while waiting for the vegetables to cook.  Otherwise, it was a great recipe, and one I'm debating cooking for my girlfriend's family next time I visit.

I just used inexpensive chops because that's what I had on hand. I found this recipe because I didn't know what to do with all the tomatoes I had from my garden. I used regular tomatoes sliced in quarters and smaller. I also used red onions. Don't use too much oil..use non-stick pan. Next time I will make more topping...soooo gooood! On leftovers, I used a balsamic vinegarette salad dressing (low fat)to bring in some more flavor...just as good!

This was excellent and looked beautiful on the plate. I made it like the recipe called for, except I sliced the pork loin chops thin and pounded them. I was worried that the thick chops would be too tough. I also used all red tomatoes because my store didn't have yellow ones. I served the pork chops with roasted asparagas and fresh bread. I will make it with risotto the next time.

These are amazing I cooked them for the whole family and I loved them.  Just remember when you let the chops sit cover them with foil and when you dish them onto the plate make sure to drizzle the juices onto the chops from the plate they were sitting in.

Very good. I grilled the pork and then topped with the onion/tomato mixture. I realized at the last minute that I didn't have any balsamic, so I substituted red wine vinegar and a bit of sugar. Really easy to make but looks and tastes fairly sophisticated. It's hard to go wrong with feta cheese...

Excellent recipe. I used inexpensive pork cutlets instead of pork chops. As suggested I used fresh basil and baked it in the oven for 20 minutes, putting the feta on before serving.  Will be making this one again for sure.

This was surprisingly good!  I had some feta cheese leftover from a greek salad the other day, and instead of fresh tomatoes I used canned, but other than that I made the recipe as is.  I always end up overcooking pork on the stovetop, so next time I'll probably bake it in the oven.  The balsamic vinegar is what made this dish, I think; don't skimp on the nasty, cheap stuff and a little bit goes a long way!  Very, very good with the fresh garlic and feta.  I served this with buttered rice and Italian cut green beans.  Tasty!

Oh my gawd YUMMMMM. I was so surprised at how good this is! My husband and I devoured this.  We added green pepper to the tomato topping and a ton of garlic powder. Very presentable dish...quick, easy.  We used regular tomatoes and chopped them up in medium sized pieces.  Next time we will make extra topping!  MAKE IT!!! P.S. I broiled my pork.  Make sure not to over cook the chops or they will be tough. Next time I think I will throw them in the slow cooker so that they are guarenteed to be tender and juicy.

Excellent, restaurant quality dish!  Great for dinner, but would *without question* serve this to company or, heck!  Royalty!  I used pork tenderloin medallions and the basil/tomato feta.  I used a regular tomato, chopped coarsely.  Again - wonderful!!!

This dish was wonderful, and so easy to prepare.  I made it almost exact per the recipe.  The only changes I made were I didn't add the last bit of oil when adding the tomatoes and cooked onions and everything back into the pan, and I used a little more balsamic vinegar, maybe another tablespoon or two.  My family loved it.  I have one pork chop and toppings leftover from last night hidden away for lunch today.  I've been thinking about it all morning!  I'm sure I'll be making this often.

Again another one over the fence into the keeper file.  Wow! Simple and fast.  I have not cooked a piece of pork on the stove top for some time.  This is a home run. Used  tenderloin because I did not have pork chops but you could even substite any mean including LAMB. Great taste, presentation and simple.  Hard to find yellow small tomatoes.  The next go around I will follow a couple of suggestions from other people namely 1.  reduce the balsamic vinegar in the pan when I am frying the pork  It gave it a blackened appearance and increased the flavor.  2.  2 big hands full of fresh spinach.  Gave it more color, flavor, just reduced the down on the second cooking of the onions. Also if you want to cheat, I saw in the store crumbled feta with basil and bits of dried tomatoes.

This was excellent.  My husband was overjoyed,  and I was glad to eat "adult food" again!  That said,  my kids didn't like it too much,  but that isn't surprising. I think next time  will add some bell pepper and capers to the mix.

We just finished eating this delicious dish :)  It was really easy to make and tasted incredible.  I usually don't cook and my roomate even said that she loved it!  I also added sundried tomatoes and red pepper to this recipe.  If you love flavour you won't regret trying this one :)

This was wonderful! I used two butterflied boneless pork chops and pan seared them in the olive oil.  Since I was only cooking for 2 people, I halved the amount of onion, which ended up being perfect.  It was a fresh-tasting and filling meal, and just enough out of the ordinary to make even a timid eater say, "Wow!"  Thanks!

Absolutely fantastic! And a surprisingly good combination of flavors. The pork chops came out very moist, and my boyfriend who doesn't usually like pork chops loved it. I even recommended the dish to my mother.

This is the second time I've made this dish, and both times it's been great!  It's simple and easy enough for a weeknight meal, and uses very little pans/utensils!

We loved this recipe.  Made some changes. Only used red grape tomatoes, could not find yellow.  Cooked tomotaoes longer than 3 minutes, we like them a little more tender than that.  I also used more olive oil.  I served it with angle hair pasta.

This was great. Didn't have any tomatoes, so I used 1/2 cup of Ro-tel tomatoes instead. Added just a little heat. This ones definitely a keeper.

Excelent!  I added fresh garlic and basil rather than dried and I used cranberry goat cheese rather than feta.  I also braised the meat in chicken broth for 30 minutes.  My kids asked for thirds and my husband who doesn't like pork chops loved it.

The recipe was very good except for the dried basil.  I would use either less basil or fresh basil.  For an inexperienced cook, the recipe lacked info about time to cook & temperature.

Not a fan of pork chops, but thought I would give this recipe a try since there are so many rave reviews.  Not a fan of balsamic vinegar either.  Maybe if I had followed others suggestions...but the chops were too dry.  The topping was "interesting", would maybe try it on chicken (but without the balsalmic).

Cooking the pork chops in the pan left them a lot more moist than my usual oven recipe.  The real winner here is the onion and tomato topping, which seems like it could be paired with other meats pretty easily.  Quick, easy (even for an amateur), and delicous!

This was so easy and tasted so good!  Wonderful flavor.  The only changes I made was that I used jarred minced garlic and about 1/2 as much onions and feta.  The tomato sauce is wonderful.  I also had it served over eggplant parmesan....Wonderful.  I will be using it again and again.  Thank you.

DH loved this recipe. He said it tasted like something from our favorite tapas restaurant. I had to use canned diced tomatoes because we didn't have fresh, and it was still phenomenal.

Wonderful recipe! I followed the other reviewer's advice and braised the pork chops in chicken broth. It was the fist time I ever had pork chops that I didn't think were too dry. And the tomato topping had so much delicious flavor! I will definitely be making this again.

I browned the chops in olive oil and a pat of butter, along with the onions, and then followed the advice of one reviewer and braised them in chicken broth. Once they were done, I removed them and reduced the broth a bit, added garlic, italian seasoning and sliced mushrooms. This made a nice sauce and it tasted really good when topped with the feta. Left off the tomatoes because it just didn't seem like it needed it. The chops were a bit dry though...although I've had that problem no matter how I prepare them and how closely I watch them and what tips I try. Very good recipe though. Thanks!

I really liked this recipe but my family really did not.  I think the feta was too much for them.  They scraped all the toppings off the pork chops and then ate the chops....there was just more for me :)

I made this recipe as written except for using thinner pork chops that were on sale. I just adjusted the cooking time and it worked well. My husband suggested adding this to our regular rotation so I think it was a hit! Tasty and fairly quick to prepare makes it a hit with me.

I had sent my son to the store & he brought back regular vine tomatoes so I used them & Altho I'm sure the grape tomatoes would be better, it was still very good. I served it with bowtie pasta with balsamic vinegar, olive oil & seasoning we buy from the local Greek restaurant. My son is not a fan of tomatoes but he enjoyed it!

These were amazing. I bought a whole pork loin and cut the chops myself. Didn't change a thing about the recipe other than use all red grape tomatoes. Will definitely make again.

Too bad I can’t give this more than 5 stars. Wow this is restaurant delicious. I had some souvlaki I had to use up so I bbq’ed the souvlaki and made the rest as directed. Once the souvlaki was cooked  I took it off the skewer and put the tomato mixture over the pieces of meat. I also had 3 tomatoes I had to use up instead of grape tomatoes. So delicious.

Great dish, but changed it a little and made it a  bit healthier.  I sauteed the onions with tomatoes with a drizzle of balsamic,  and a splash or two or vermouth.  I then baked the pork chops(bone it) with the sauce that I made in the oven for about an hour on 325 to slow cook them. and added low fat feta on top that melted nicely.  It was tender and delish!

Adding the feta cheese gave that extra punch of flavor. Definitely will make again.

This is a good recipe but I didn't think it was "special" enough to call it amazing. The only change I made was to follow some other reviewers' suggestions, so I used petite diced tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes  and I carmelized everything in the pan (after browning the chops and setting them aside in a warm oven). I sprinkled the feta on top as I dished up the chops. The best part of the dish is the tomato/onion topping, which would also be good on some angel hair pasta as a side with the chops.

This is one of the best recipes I've ever made. My fiancée, who works as a cook for a living, also really enjoyed it. Made it exactly as written and couldn't have been happier with it. Also, I'm low carb so definitely recommend if you are too!

Thank you to the poster for sharing this - it will become a regular meal for us!

This was my first time making pork chops, so the direction "cook until desired doneness" wasn't very helpful.  I could have looked up ideal cooking times online, but I thought I would be able to tell; in any case, my pork chops turned out pretty tough, so I think they were probably overcooked.  For anyone reading this and making pork chops for the first time, I'd recommend you look up the ideal cooking time first.
As for the topping, it was pretty good, but I'm not sure I would make it again--even for a different kind of meat.  A variation on this theme, though, could be pretty delicious.

I used Pork Shanks with the bone and I bought a rack of seven. Then I cut them in about ¾” slices. 
The Pork Shanks with the bone left on made this recipe very rich in taste and with the bone left on it kept the meat very juicy. As a side dish I used garlic mashed potatoes and fresh cut green beans. I like my vegetables fresh not over cooked still crunchy with no added seasoning or butter. A  favorite for me. Enjoy. Mikeal

Wow!  After reading the base recipe, I knew this would be a good one, and it didn't disappoint.  I followed the recipe except I added a sliced red pepper and kalamata olives.  I followed some other chef's suggestions and seared and then topped and baked.  Pork was tender, moist, and extremely flavorful. Served with roasted brussel sprouts and a Mediterranean risotto.  A definite make again.  Great job on the original!!!!  Thanks for sharing.

I used sweet onion and I would use a little less salt. The tomatoes, cheese and vinegar had enough natural saltyness. I placed the chops on a bed of plain white rice. The family loved it!!!

I used 2 boneless pork chops.  I sauteed some onion and garlic and then browned pork chops in same pan with onions, after I put garlic powder, onion powder and oregano on each side of pork chops.  After they were browned I added about 1 C. or so of chicken broth to which I added some balsamic vinegar  to the pan with the pork chops, covered it, turned down heat and let them braise till done and tender.  Took pork chops out of pan, and let broth and onions cook down about 1/2.  Then added some cut up tomatoes, capers and basil and let them cook for a minute or two.  Added pork chops back into pan, spooned onions, tomatoes mixture on top of chops and topped w/feta cheese.  Covered it and let it cook on low for a minute or so to soften cheese.  It was very good.

My girlfriend and I made this for my mother and father. They are picky with onions so I set them aside after cooking them with the tomatoes. It was a fantastic meal and I really enjoyed how the balsamic, feta and onions came together. 

Served with a Persian herbed rice, and greek salad for an awesome late summer meal.

This was awesome!  Hubs & I both loved it.  I used fresh regular tomatoes instead of the cherry ones, just because I had them on hand.  The only other change I made was that after the pork chops were browned on both sides, I added some white cooking wine and covered them so that they would cook through and not get dry.  (Next time might try baking chops in oven for 15 mins or so after browned)

Easy and delicious.  These were literally the best pork chops I've ever had, and I will definitely make them again.  I subbed stuff that I didn't have on hand (plum tomatoes for grape, omitted feta) and traded some of the dried basil for fresh.

I hate pork!! However, I loved this dish! My husband loves pork so I cook it frequently. This dish came together quickly and the flavors were amazing. The addition of the feta was a great idea although I was hesitant at first. This recipe is getting added to our dinner rotation especially since both of my kids (4 & 3) gobbled it up! I made the recipe exactly as written, I sautéed the onions and pork in the same pan and added a 1/4 c chicken broth to the sauce at the end to loosen it up a little. Delicious!!

Fantastic combination of herbs, veg, tangy cheese, and tender, tender pork. Like several other reviewers, I seared the chops on the stovetop and then finished in the oven. It kept the meat ultra moist.

Made this for my family tonight. Received a thumbs up to make it again. I added about 3 or 4 tablespoons of white wine after sautéing the tomatoes and garlic for 4 minutes. Also used goat cheese instead of feta.

Hubby and 11yr old son LOVED this.  I thought they might like it, but didn't expect them to love it sooo much.  So yes, we'll be making it again :) I served them with a side of white rice and a kale salad. MMM

Simple, fresh and tasty ingredients.  Only sub was fresh basil.  Next time will make with either chicken or boneless pork.  I seared chops in pan, then put in a 350 degree oven, turned temp down to 300, and baked for as long as it took to make some rice to go with it.  Pork was tender and tasty. Wish the onions had gotten a little softer, but that's just personal preference.

Used thin pork chops instead of the thicker bone in ones. Everything was great! I'm not even a huge fan of pork, and I was happy to eat the leftovers for lunch the next day. Will be making these again!

This was Great! My boyfriend and mother thought it was restaurant quality. I followed the recipe pretty close. I used cayenne pepper as well as the garlic, salt &  pepper in the pork and I boiled a couple poblano peppers that I put on top of the pork which added a great mild heat to it.

This was delicious! I made it according to the recipe with one exception. I mistakenly put the pork chops in a skillet first. So, I just sautéed the onion mixture in another skillet and topped off the pork chops with it when they were done. I'll certainly make this again.

The flavors in this recipe are phenomenal! I followed some review recommendations and browned the chops with the onions and then braised them in chicken broth. I followed the recipe with everything else though. I was thoroughly impressed, and will definitely make this again!

This was delicious! I made the recipe as is but only made one large pork chop rib for myself. There wasn't enough balsamic for me so I just drizzled more on top! So great. I can't wait to make it again!

My family loved it!  Of course I had to substitute because I try to use up what I have around the house.  I used vegetable oil instead of olive, regular red tomatoes, bone in chops (just cut bone out), no vinegar, and garlic salt instead of powder.  Hubby said he could eat the vegetables by itself all day long.  Thanks so much for an easy, fulfilling recipe!

This was a great pork recipe!!! I am always nervous to cook pork, never sure if it will be tough, or, on the other end of it, not cooked well enough. It turned out GREAT. My boyfriend really loved it and he is a great cook himself.. so when I impress him that says something. The only change I made was I only browned the chops in the pan, I then transferred them over to a casserole dish and slowly cooked them at 325 for half an hour while doing the side dish. Yummy!!!!!

This recipe is amazing with chicken... not so much pork. We make it the exact same way as the recipe just without the yellow tomatoes and chicken instead of pork. New staple in our house. I'll give it a five stars because it's not their fault we aren't crazy about pork!

Soooo easy and delicious!  I make this using chicken breasts and any type of tomatoes I have available.  It still tastes great with canned tomatoes or roma tomatoes, though maybe it doesn't look restaurant worthy.

This was pretty good.  Next time I will leave out the balsamic vinegar, as we did not care for it in this recipe. Fixed with spaghetti squash casserole and succotash.

This dish is absolutely delicious!  Flavours are wonderful. The first time I made this recipe I served it to dinner guests and while one of the guests cannot eat pork, I added a chicken breast. Definitely a hit with all my guests.  Only thing, when serving to dinner guests I had to make it on the spot and even though I had all the ingredients ready in separate containers it still took 35 minutes so there's a huge gap between courses.

It was really good.  The only suggestion I have is to double the topping because we wished we had more of the yummy topping and it's mostly veggies so why not!

My husband and I LOVED this dish. The balsamic with the onions and tomatoes was a great combination. The feta mellowed out the tangy taste of the balsamic, it was perfect!

I found this recipe while searching for the best way to get rid of lots of grape tomatoes. THANK GOODNESS I FOUND IT. Apparently 3 out of 4 people at my dinner gathering can't stand pork chops, but everyone ended up just shy of licking their plates. Changes: I followed reviews to braise the meat; also used fresh basil and subbed goat cheese for feta (all I had and I think I prefer it!).

Made this as directed and the family loved it!  I used boneless chops and served as suggested with asparagus and garlic mashed potatos, it was awesome!  The balsamic and feta really compliment the pork.

Easy and delicious!!!  Pork chops and some shriveling grape tomatoes in the fridge led me to this fantastic recipe!  Followed the recipe exactly and I felt like I was dining in a gourmet restaurant.  The balsamic and feta pair beautifully with the pork, onion and tomatoes.  This is a keeper.

Great flavors! I've made this several times now and last time I didn't have feta so I used goat cheese and I liked it even more! My husband loved it, too. Thanks for a wonderful dinner.

Fantastic!I followed the recipe pretty closely, the only change I made was adding kalamata olives to the tomatoes and using both fresh basil and fresh rosemary. I highly recommend doing it this way, it's a very slight, easy change and it enhances and compliments the flavors of the original recipe.Very much a keeper!

Excellent!! Made with grilled chicken(put in pan with tomato/feta topping & back on grill to warm up). I've been cooking lots on the grill to keep heat out of house & this worked well! My husband loved it!! I will try with chops next time. Thanks!

It's always a challenge keeping variety in our weekday meals, but these pork chops were easy to make and very tasty.  My husband, who doesn't like balsamic vinegar, even said they were very nice (that's a huge compliment from him :-) ).  I only used red grape tomatoes and we didn't have garlic powder so I used a few cloves of fresh garlic.

Delicious fast, fresh & easy.  One hint--don't use dried basil, ever....it's just not the same.  Many herbs are good dried like thyme and rosemary, but basil completely loses it's character when dried.  Will make this again!

This was a big hit. I tried the suggestion of braising in chicken broth. Pork turned out moist and delicious. I also used the diced tomatoes. It was quite delicious.

Excellent dish. I looked at the reviews and really only added extra garlic. Added about another teaspoon. I cooked the onion with the pork chop, then removed the chops and followed the recipe as written. DELICIOUS!

Great recipe. I made a few changes, some of them major. I used chicken thighs instead of pork. I used a cup of tomato sauce, instead of fresh tomatoes (neither of us like tomatoes fresh). I cooked the chicken thighs, onions, & fresh garlic together.

I'm not a big fan of pork chops so I used boneless chicken breasts instead.  I used 2 but kept the rest of the ingredients the same so as to double the sauce.  I also used the chicken broth method as others recommended.  Just braise the chicken in about a cup of chicken broth covered for 30 minutes.  Made it oh so tender.  I served this over angel hair pasta.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I thought this was delicious and so easy to make!  I overcooked the pork, though, so next time I will either use chicken or be a little more careful.  The sauce was awesome!  Especially with the feta.  I had fresh basil and some farmer's market tomatoes, so I used those.  Served with a fresh salad and an orzo pasta salad.

This dish is great!  I've made it a few times with fresh tomatoes and once with canned.  It was good either way.  I use less balsamic vinegar just because I find that a little goes a long way.  I really like the feta on top and it makes for great presentation.  Delicious!

It's always nice to try something different! I liked the recipe but didn't love it! My husband isn't crazy about pork chops so I think next time we will try it on filets or chicken.

Everyone loved these except for me... so it was probably just a taste preference. Followed the recipe exactly and it came out great.

I have made this recipe several times and am making it again tonight. It is so delicious and so simple. My husband loves it! The only change I made is that I use medallions of pork tenderloin instead of pork chops. We just prefer the tenderloin. I cut them into about half-inch medallions and then flatten them a little. This dish is a staple at our house. It's my go to meal when I don't know what to cook!

Excellent Recipe. Have always been a fan of balsamic and feta but never thought to put it on pork chops. Great idea! Definitely a keeper.

What a great recipe.  Very simple but comes out like you really put alot of time into it.  The balsamic vinegar creates such a lovely sauce that blended perfectly with the mashed potatoes.  This will be added to the lineup!

I will surely use this in the future! I loved it. I made some minor changes. I grilled the onions with the garlic then added the pork chops.I added a little bit of red pepper flakes. I used balsamic dressing instead and used about 3-4 tablespoons. I topped with tomatoes and continuted to grill. I added just a touch of chicken broth to keep the meat juicy. It was great!

Wow, simply delicious. I first seared the meat, and then simmered it with a little chicken broth and some of the minced garlic. I will be making this again in the next few days!

My first time making pork chops and it was a success.  I needed to use up the Juliette tomatoes growing in my back yard but that was the only substitution I made.

Not my favorite.  I think I would have been happier without the tomatoes, or without the balsamic (I'm not sure which).  Though fiancee thought it was alright.

I use a pint of regular cherry tomatoes, and leave out the fetta.  I've made it with balsamic and red wine vinegar (I like the red wine vinegar best)  both turn out great.  Also, I let it sit in the pan for about 20 minutes afterwards to set the flavors.  MMMMM

This was great!  The seasoning on the pork is simple, but it brings out and accentuates the natural pork flavor. I used apple cider vinegar instead and lean butterflied pork loin instead of chops.  The dish paired perfectly w/ home made spanish white rice. Will definately use this recipe again : )

Loved it!  I had pork chops that had to be cooked and this was the closest recipe to the ingredients I had on hand.  I didn't have fresh tomatoes so I used the tomato chunks from a can of rotel(I left out most of the chiles and drained all the juice).  I also had some large olives and I added about four of them (chopped up) to the tomatoes in the sauce pan.  Lastly, I used some chopped roasted garlic from a jar instead of fresh. It turned out great and had a little kick. It will be one of my favorites.

I loved it, but my husband was not a big fan.  I definately think this recipe would compliment chicken very well!  Actually, I think it would be better with chicken than with pork chops.

I LOVED this recipe. I did do a couple things different from the recipe. I used a 14 oz. can of diced tomt and a 14 oz. can of stewed tomt instead because I did not have the grape tomt. I loved the little bit of sweetness the stewed tomt added especially with the feta. mmmmmmm. I also had 3 small home grown red bell pepper that I sliced very thin. I added those at the same time with the garlic and tomt. (Oh and I did make it a point to use red onion) Everyone in my house loved this dish!! I will definitely do again!

YUM! I took another persons advice and seared the pork chops for only a couple minutes on each side and then cooked everything in the oven for about half an hour. Delicious!

I hate it when people change the recipe, but I did so out of necessity. I didn't have dried basil so I used fresh and also just used regular tomatoes because it was all I had.  I seared the chops and then baked.  This was delicious!  I will definitely make these again and again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was awesome, and I did not change a thing!  My boyfriend is picky and he usually doesn't like anything with any kind of vegetables (even tomatoes) but he keeps raving about it!  I also made it for some friends and they asked for the recipe.  Definitely a keeper.

Good but didn't pack as much flavor as I had expected it too. I would definately make again just maybe add some fresh basil instead of dried to strengthen the flavor. Enjoy

Added sliced green, yellow, red peppers, mushrooms and some onions.  Also used canned diced tomatos instead.  LOVE THIS RECIPE! We eat this once a week as it is so light and has so much flavor. I use the thin boneless chops. Cooks fast and tender.  Would make this for company in a heartbeat. Can't say enough, this has become my favorite meal.

This was pretty good.  Used canned diced tomatoes, fresh basil, and added sliced black olives.  Served over angel hair pasta which worked well.

Loved this recipe! The only change I made was using diced fresh plum tomatoes because our grocery store was out of grape tomatoes. Next time I will use them and would also love to try it with chicken.

This recipe was delicious!  I overcooked the pork a little bit, but I tend to do that.  However, the sauce was incredibly wonderful and mouth watering!  I highly recommend this dish.  Make sure you do not overcook the pork.

This is my first review and I couldn't wait to say that this meal was excellent.  I ended up substituting the feta with parmesan (both are salty) and I used red wine vinegar.  My husband loved it and asked when I was going to make it again!

This was great over thick cut pork chops.  We baked them in the oven then put the tomato mix on top and served with a green salad. I can't wait to try on chicken!

this is awesome. great way to change up pork chops. i don't always use the grape tomatos but it is delicious anyway! Dh even loves it and requests it often which is saying a lot because he rarely makes a departure from his usually diet.

Made this the other night.  It was just OK.  I used garden tomatoes as I had an abundance.  It just didn't have the flavors that I like.  My husband made no comment so he must have not been too impressed.

Husband liked this.  Good for something different.  I think the pork would be better and more moist if the pork chops were simmered in wine or something, as reviewer foodaholic did.  Feta adds a nice touch.

Awesome recipe! My neighbor called me up and asked me what I was cooking because I had my windows up, she wanted to come to dinner it smelled so good and tasted awesome. We loved it. 
Thanks

This is a great recipe!  I make it as is except to use all red grape tomatoesm (more economical), and a bit more garlic.  Last time I made it I used fresh basil.  Terrific!! Thanks Lovecooking.

Really enjoyed this but did make a couple changes.  Used sun dried tomato, canned tomatoes and turned out great.  Also added the goat cheese to the the sauce mixture on low heat to that it was melted before pouring on chops.  Delicious.

This was just okay.  I used a can of crushed tomatoes as others suggested.  I did everything else exact to the recipe.  Tasted like pork chops with spagetti sauce and feta cheese to me.  I may make it again, but won't rush to do so.

The flavor was pretty good but the chops were dry, even when braised in chicken broth.  I may try this again sometime with a tenderloin or 2" chops, as they're easier to cook and keep moist than chops are.  But this wasn't a recipe that left me anxiously awaiting the next opportunity to make it.

I also did the 'braising in chicken broth' thing and, alas, my skinny little pork loin chops still ended up a tad dry. We enjoyed the tomato (I used regular vine-ripened reds; I've never seen yellow toms at Meijer) /onion topping, although the finely-sliced garlic was still virtually raw after 5 mins of simmering. I dished this up with angel hair pasta. I really cannot give this anything more than 3 stars, but with tweaking it could be really incredible.

Very good recipe.  I didn't have grape tomato so I used regular tomato and it was fine.  Very nice looking presentation and very tasty!

Quick and tasty is the best way to describe this. I followed the suggestion to use the chicken broth and I think that helps keep the chops from getting dry and over cooked.
