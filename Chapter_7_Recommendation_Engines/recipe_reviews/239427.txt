Another great recipe from Mazola! It tasted just like the recipe states - creamy with a hint of mustard. I served it over egg noodles so I doubled the sauce because we like our noodles doused in sauce. I don't have a Dutch oven unfortunately so I just cooked it all in a deep skillet on the stove. Also I added a few dashes of onion powder to the chicken as it browned for added flavor. Oh and I used heavy cream instead of half and half because I already had it in my fridge. This was very good!

This recipe has a lot of potential. I make a lot of French dishes and I think this was an excellent try at a quick and easy poulet a la moutarde. If I made it again I would add at least 2 T butter to the 2 T oil when saut√©ing the leeks (and reduce that 2 T oil to 1 T). I might even add a bit of diced onion. I would up the chicken broth and definitely use at least 1 cup of heavy cream and at least 1/2 c of white cooking wine. My family felt the recipe exactly as it is was much too Dijon-y and that "something was missing". (They are very used to reviewing recipes by now.):) To "fix" the recipe after the initial go I added 1/2 c white cooking wine plus 2 T butter and let the sauce reduce on the stove for a good bit. It tasted loads better but I think the proportions were too off to fix. Even so 2 of the 3 teenagers over for dinner had this dish as leftovers tonight.
