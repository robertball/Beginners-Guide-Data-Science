Marinade for the beef is good! Although next time, I would use ground beef so its more mix-able.   However, with preparing the vegetables, I added some things for more flavor: Mushrooms, I sauteed them with 1 tsp vegetable oil, 2tsp soysauce and 2tsp sugar and some sesame oil. Bean sprouts, I cooked them in a pot with a cup of water with 1tsp of salt for 20 minutes, then mixed it with 1 clove minced garlic, sesame oil and a pinch of salt. Spinach:I boiled it for a minute, as per the recipe, then added a pinch of salt, 1 tsp soysauce, 1 clove mince garlic and sesame oil. Zucchini and carrots : sprinkled with salt and sauted for a few minutes separately.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Made this last night for the first time.  My husband lived in Korea for a year and this was one of his favorite dishes to order.  I scaled it down to four and made as directed (even the raw egg which my husband insisted on).  It was great but way too sweet.  Once we added a spoon full of kuchujang to each of our bowls, it was perfect.  My husband has requested me to make it again.  Next time I'll reduce the marinade a little so it's not overly sweet and my kids can eat it without the kochujang.  Also, skip the drizzle of sesame oil on the finished product (doesn't need it).

This was great - we tried it on a whim, and man were we happy with this gem. We used pyrex bowls, replaced green onion with regular, and used a few other fresh vegetables we had on hand ( snow peas, baby carrots and arugula). We didn't have chili paste so we looked up a substitute, and it really became the star of the dish alongside the meat.  Will be making again, and again... and again.

Great recipe! Thanks for sharing. I did modify it a little, decreasing the sugar by half (using 1/4 C sugar and 1/4 C honey). Still, it was plenty sweet. I also omitted several ingredients I did not have, such as cucumber, carrot, and sesame seeds. Also, on one serving, I attempted the raw egg feat, but it didn't cook into the meal like I had expected, so the whole bowl of food became slippery from the egg. On other servings, I simply fried the egg on one side, then inverted it onto the food. Much better, in my opinion! I only had 1 lb. meat, so I used that. I substituted habanero hot sauce for the chili sauce, as well. Additionally, the only oil I used was a small bit to oil the dishes, and a small bit for frying eggs, spinach, sprouts, etc. I did not pour any over the finished dish. Note: To get the rice to sizzle, I had to put the rice in immediately after oiling the bowl (I used Pyrex bowls.) When I oiled more than one bowl at a time before adding rice, the rice didn't sizzle. So don't let those oiled bowls sit if you want the sizzle. :) The way I made it, I probably give it a four and a half. If I'd had the other ingredients on hand, I think that would have pushed this recipe into 5-star territory. Hence the rating.

This recipe is time consuming, but definitely worth it. I made it exactly as is, and it was wonderful.

**My rating is soley based on the marinade for the meat since I didn't follow the rest of the recipe.**  The Outback Steakhouse here in Daegu, South Korea serves a dish called Kakadu Griller and the main ingredient is a galbi marinated steak. The marinade from this recipe tastes just like that! So I used bulgogi style cut steak and marinaded the steak for a couple hours.  I then coated the bottom of a cast iron skillet with sesame seed oil, dumped in all of the steak with some of the marinade and let it come to a boil until the steak was thoroughly cooked.  I then served it on top of white rice and it was amazing.

This is a great, easy to make and non-time consuming recipe. I used only 1/4 cup of brown sugar, substituted the beef for ground turkey, zucchini for cucumbers, omitted spinach, used regular white long grain rice, and used Schiracha. I also added some Daikon. No stoneware needed. It was delicious! This is indeed a very flexible recipe!

Used ingredients I had on hand: ground turkey, cabbage, spinach, snow peas, as well as the suggested seasonings, rice, egg, and nori.  Instead of marinating the meat, I just cooked it with the marinade ingredients (used less, just to taste).  It still tasted outstanding, and was very easy to prepare.  Will definitely make this regularly!

I usually don't find bibimbap recipes that use brown sugar. This is an interesting addition. I think next time I may try this, just to see what the taste differenc e is. Otherwise, this seems like the usual bibimbap recipe that is always great!

This was SO much better than I was expecting. I used 1/4 cup of soy sauce, 1/4 cup of each sugar and a little bit of honey for the marinade with the green onions, garlic and sesame seeds (1 pound of meat) and it was PERFECT. I could have eaten the meat alone!    I then used carrots, spinach, cucumbers, mushrooms, and peppers for the veggies.  For a pepper sauce, I used Srirachi pepper sauce. I also cooked the rice in a rice cooker and then pressed "cook" again after it was finished to crisp up the bottom rice for about 5 minutes.

This is a very very good, delicious recipe!!  My Korean bro in law loves it, which says a lot!  Also, I made this for Christmas dinner for about 8 people and people raved about it!!  Did not use stone bowls, or nori sheets, I always use the cucumbers and carrots and of course the meat marinade I make exactly how the recipe calls for and it is very authentic tasting:). Make it!  You won't be disappointed!

Timing is everything with this recipe. The layers of flavor and texture are wonderful.
I served a loose fried egg (non stick pan with minimal olive oil) instead of the raw egg and use a high quality steak. In addition I used white s'rooms saluted with the other veg. My husband loved this meal. 
A Very worthwhile recipe it won't disappoint.

I made this for my son's birthday dinner, and it was a huge hit.  Everyone young and old enjoyed the meal and had fun with it. Definitely a keeper!
