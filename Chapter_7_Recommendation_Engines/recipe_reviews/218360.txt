The taste was good but the construction seemed all wrong. Breading fell off American cheese got stiff. My suggestion would be to add a couple of tbsp of butter to the canola when pan frying the chicken. I do this in other recipes and never have problems with the breading staying on. Also I'd bake the chicken for about 5-10 mins then add the bacon and cheese. Or just wait until it comes out of the oven and use a little cheese sauce to pour on the breasts. I had high hopes for this one but it just didn't come out quite as well as I hoped it would.

This chicken is great! I did not have cornbread stuffing so I used chicken stuffing mix. Next time I will try it with the cornbread stuffing. I also chopped up the bacon into little pieces so there was bacon with every bite. This will be going into my recipe box!

This has potential to be yummy but the issue for me was how bland the chicken itself was. The topping was nice and cruncnhy and flavorful but when you bite into the chicken it needs help. I would brine the chicken first in a salt/spice blend and then use the cornbread/bacon on top

This was great! I loved the stuffing as a breading idea and plan on doing that again.

I used cheddar cheese instead of American and it turned out great! I like my food more flavorful so I would suggest more spices in the flour mixture such as garlic powder and onion powder. Otherwise it was great! My family loved it and even my picky little sister ate it.
