I used coconut oil instead of olive oil for the flavor, added garlic salt and shredded carrots for color and flavor. Turned out pretty good!

Hearty and filling; l used it to accompany a butternut squash soup. I added shredded carrot and finely minced vidalia onion to give it a veggie boost.

This is really good as a warm side dish or warm lunch salad. I used only 1 cup of wheat berries, added grated carrot, and used peanuts and dried peaches instead of sunflower seeds and raisins. I also added some lemon zest and juice from half a lemon to brighten the flavor. Turned out great!

Very tasty.  I substituted hemp seeds because I had them and thought the dish turned out great.  Will certainly make this again.

This was a great recipe. I cooked the wheat berries a day ahead and refrigerated them until the day of my party. I also added dried mango. Yummy!

I added more curry for personal tastes and used flax oil instead of olive oil for the omega benefits. Tasted great.

I liked this.  On the spicy side.  I only used about 1/2 the raisins and sunflower seeds, to keep it on the lighter side.  Will make again!

I was up a creek finding something for my vegetarian DIL. This was a winner. Used black beans and grated carrots .
