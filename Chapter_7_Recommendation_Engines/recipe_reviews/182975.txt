I love this vegetable soup, but I might have changed it so much it's not quite this recipe. This recipe was the inspiration: I used 2 cans of low salt, low fat chicken stock; 4 c. water; about 6 smallish carrots; 4 stalks of celery, peeled; 2 pinches of dried basil; 2 pinches of dried thyme; a few sprinkles of an onion-based salt-substitute; the liquid from a can of stewed tomatoes; 3-4 cloves garlic, crushed. Boil/simmer this for 30 min. Then added 1 head of cabbage, chopped; the stewed tomatoes; 2 roma tomatoes, quartered; bunch of green beans (1-2 cups?); bunch of crimini mushrooms (1/2 cup?); 1 cut zucchini. Cook for 30 min. more. Add kale, cook for about 10 min. Good soup, or how to get rid of all the veggies in your fridge -- in a good way :-)

Very good recipe, this has to be healthy. I made this last night and went by the recipe and it was great, probably the best vegetable soup I have had. Thanks for the recipe.

This is a great back to basics recipe, which is why I'm giving it a 5-star. It was just what I was looking for. There are so many ways you can expand upon it and still end up with a good tasting, healthy recipe. I changed things up, according to what was in my refrigerator/garden.  Added fresh zucchini, tomatoes, garlic, and cilantro.  Didn't have green beans or Great Northern beans. Shredded a couple of chicken breasts and tossed them in, just because I'm feeding youngsters who need the protein. Served with grated cheese, rolls, and sour cream.  Very satisfying meal.  May try ground turkey next time.  Thank You!

This was just the ticket on a rainy Portland day.  It's very good as written.  I used diced whole carrots rather than baby carrots, and also added 3 large cloves of garlic - this really helped the flavor.  I used good quality chicken broth, more than water.  Plenty of coarse black pepper as well as salt.  I disagree that it makes too much.  I'm sure we will go through it quickly (2 person family!)  Good on its own, or along with a sandwich for a great lunch - will try adding some chicken one day, as one reviewer described.

I was actually surprised by how much I liked this. I expected that it might be a little bland and that I wouldn need to add more seasonings, but I didn't. It was great as written. It was also easy to make, cheap and healthy - what more can you ask for in a soup?

We're in the midst of a deep freeze and soup seemed to be the answer to the question "what's for dinner"? This could not have been more appropriate for warming up after shoveling snow and warding off the brrrrrrrr! I followed the recipe as is and made AR's Amish White Bread to go with. My daughter and 3 gr.kids ate with us and she had to have a copy of the recipe before going home when she saw that the children were asking for seconds!   This really reminds me of the pot of soup my gramma always seemed to have on the stove when the weather outside became really cold.  I will absolutely do this again.  Excellent way to get more veggies.  Thank you for sharing.

This was my first homemade vegetable soup and it was very good! I didn't have northern beans so I sued a can of red kidney beans I had on hand and Trader Joe's didn't have any cabbage so I used broccoli slaw instead and it worked just fine.  I added another can of diced tomatoes and doubled the chicken broth because there wasn't enough liquid.  I added gorgonzola cheese crackers from Trader Joe's on top and it was delicious!

This was a great base recipe, but I made some alterations: Left out the beans and the cabbage, did 32 oz vegetable stock instead of 28. Added an entire bunch of asparagus, sliced on the diagonal (minus the very bottoms and leaving the very tops in tact), 4 cloves of finely chopped garlic and cooked some cheese tortellini separately and then added in the last 10 minutes before serving. I also added fresh ground pepper and ground sea salt. Topped with fresh Parmesan and texas toast croutons.  Very good recipe.  It made about 16 cups of soup...will definitely be freezing some!  Thanks for sharing.

This is an easy recipe to play off of with the veggies you have available.  I added zucchini and corn.  I also used some soy sauce and worcestershire sauce for flavor.  Next time I would definitely add in bay leaf for some depth of flavor.

Great old-fashioned soup. Flavor was great. I added a little creole spice to kick it up and used corn instead of green beans. My kids even liked it.

This is a good base recipe.  I used vegetable broth instead of chicken, added some leftover baked beans and some noodles for body. It was a comforting meal after a long day.

This was a little boring, but definitely a great base recipe for vegetable soup. Next time I think I would throw in some meat or corn, and some additional seasoning. I don't think I like green beans in soup either, so I'll omit them next time.

healthy, simple, cheap, and delicious!! i thought it was great since you could add or take out whatever you wish.  i added some corn, barley, and about a tablespoon of sugar as it was a little too tart for my taste.

I read most of the previously written reviews and thought they were very helpful. The base of this soup is perfect. I replaced a few of the ingredients with things I already had. I did add a bay leaf and some minced garlic which both added some flavor. I like my soup hearty so I also added some bowtie pasta. It was delicious!

Delicious and Filling! I added crushed garlic and only half the tomatoes. I did'nt have the beans, but I put ground turkey and broccoli 30 mins. into the cooking, which the cooking time was 1 hour.This recipe did'nt need any alterations and the base allows you to be creative. Thank you for sharing!

Not bad. I loved all the veggies! However, I think if i made it again, I'd have to up the spices or find something else to add, as it seemed a little bland for me. and, it made A LOT! I didn't realize how much it made until i was practically done, and as i didn't have a pot big enough, had to divide it b/t two pans!

I've made this several times and my family loves it.  But in the few times I've made it, I've modified.  I add chic peas, omit the potato (because they never seem to cook enough), and I add a small amount of mini shell pasta just before serving.  This is delicious, nutricious and everyone loves it.

Easy to follow, easy to cook recipe.  I modified it a bit tho.  I didn't have any chicken broth or stock so I boiled 2 chicken legs then added 2 bouillon cubes. I'm not adding the chicken, that's for my son's dinner).   Vegetables I added are: Carrot, celery, onion, tomato, yellow zucchini, black beans, frozen string beans and corn.   I added fresh garlic, dill, scallions, parsley and pepper.  No Salt (I have HBP). Should be just about done.I may add a touch of cayenne pepper as well. Yum!

This soup is simple and AMAZING.  I ended up using about 2 tsp. of salt and 3/4 basil and 3/4 oregano for seasoning since we aren't big basil fans.  I also used regular carrots and canned green beans and added some corn and butter beans, too.  (What's veggie soup without corn?)  I might add some more beans next time, they kind of disappeared in the mix.  I cooked a couple large chicken breasts in a skillet and diced them up and threw them in the pot with the drippings.  Tasted great!  At the end, I mixed 1/3 cup corn starch and  1/4 cup water and added it to thicken the broth a little--I just don't care for clear broth.

Changed out green beans for kale, potatoes for sweet potatoes and chicken broth for veggie broth and some water (lower sodium). Add Veggie Crumbles last 10min. Served with crusty bread and a salad. The whole family loved it!

Decent but nothing special. It could really be hearty'd up by doubling potatoes or something. Not sure what it needs but it left us flat.

Great recipe. I substituted extra cabbage and cheese tortellini for the potatoes. Much better this way. Also for better flavor try adding zesty diced tomatoes instead of regular.

This soup was really good. I added an extra can of vegetable broth and added a can of corn. I also left out the potatoes because I don't like potatoes in vegetable soup. A great way to get in a lot of veggies.

A huge hit a our Daniel Fast Dinner Event. The soup is hearty and flavorful! It is so versatile, you can add whatever you have on hand and add your favorite seasonings too! I recommend cutting the cabbage into bite size pieces. I left out the N. Beans, I did not have them. I also left out the celery, don't care for it in soup. I am making this again tonight, with whats left in the fridge!

Very good.  I needed a little more kick and had to double the listed spices plus add some pepper and garlic.  Great way to get veggies without eating yet another salad.

It's wonderful to get something so delicious from a recipe that is so simple. I added peas, corn, & a heavy cup of quinoa that was precooked with veg broth.

I added fresh parsley and the chopped fresh leaves from several stalks of basil, thyme AND sage and it was still pretty plain.  I'm using this recipe instead for the cabbage soup diet, so it's fine. ALSO 60 minutes simmering time was WAY enough. 50 minutes might even be enough so check it around that time. I used sweet potatoes instead of regular  potatoes and it was delicious.  I also used a 32 oz carton of vegetable broth and only 1.5 cups of water.

When I realized that my pot was too small for only just the fresh ingredients, I decided to toss it into my slow cooker. I grated the carrot and minced (by mistake) the celery and decided to toss in some sweet corn. I let it slow-cook for several hours. After about 6 hours I found it a little bitter and panicked! I randomly added: 1 tsp. Olive Oil, 1 tbsp. Balsamic Vinegar, 2 tbsp. Garlic Powder, 1 cup cooked Black Forest Ham, some chopped fresh parsely, a few squirts of lemon juice and 1 tbsp. Oregano. What do you know it worked out and is sooooooo much tastier (to me) than the original recipe. I may have ruined it by accidentally mincing my celery in my new magic bullet. But after 6 hours I figured that's what it would taste like and my boyfriend and I ate up my hodgepodge creation so I thought I'd share it :)

This was a very simple recipe...I think where I went wrong is by adding no salt vegetable broth which meant it was quite bland. However, I ate the whole pot and it was amazing with hot sauce. I’m not a big fan of cabbage so I think I’ll get another recipe as my go too but this was definitely good and worth trying.

This is a solid veggie soup recipe. The rubbed sage makes it somehow. I add garlic and sometimes frozen sweet corn, and sub out kale for the cabbage. Add parsley and lemon juice at the end to cut the acidity & brighten it up.

This was a good and comforting soup.  I used some homemade tomato broth I had in the freezer instead of the vegetable broth so I left out the canned tomatoes.  Also added oregano and garlic powder and some corn.

I added extra beans since the can I had on hand was bigger as well as noodles about 10 minutes before it was done. I'm not sure the noodles were really necessary since they soaked up too much of the broth but it was delicious anyway and easy to make. If I were to do it again I think more potatoes would be the way I would go.

This soup recipe is a great basic starting point. I've made it just as written and it was very good and simple. This Thanksgiving I used the  veggies left over from a vegetable tray. I also used up the last of the turkey.  I will definitely keep this recipe for future use.

Great recipe. I made a few changes with the spices.  I omitted the basil, thyme and sage.  I added fresh garlic and Cayenne pepper.  Did anyone else notice corn in the pic but not listed as an ingredient?  oh well.

My spin on this recipe because we like it kicked up a notch was to Add 2 cups of cooked chicken chopped and a can of Original Rotel. The family and the neighbors LOVED it!

Great recipe that helped me use up some of those veggies that were accumulating.
