4 stars as written...really good flavor!  2nd time around, I did adapt a bit - used two 10 oz. cans chicken (drained), put the Cheddar in the mix...made balls not pancake (we don't like 'loose' mashed potatoes - the thicker mash made it easy to form).  Rolled them in Panko and baked @ 350* for 15-20 min.  Husband raved, kids fought for the last few...so yummy!

These tasted great and took no time at all.  I used leftover cut up chicken instead of the frozen breaded chicken and wing sauce instead of red hot. However, I had a hard time getting the pancakes to stay together and ended up with chicken wing mashed potato. The taste was great, but the appearance was not. I used store bought mashed potato so maybe they are not the right consistency.
