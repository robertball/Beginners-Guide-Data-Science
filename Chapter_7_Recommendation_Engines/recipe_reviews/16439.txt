After reading the other reviews, I knew that this was a versatile recipe.  I wasn't sure I had the right soups, but I knew I could come close.  I used french onion soup instead of the vegetable beef soup and I added chopped fresh broccoli.  My husband told me to make this again soon.  I like the fact that I can throw this together with what I might have on hand, and have a good comfort food meal.  French bread and salad were all I added to round out our dinner!!  Thanks!

YUMMY!! My family went crazy over this recipe!  I made some adjustments based on other suggestions.  7 sliced peeled potatoes, 2 packages turkey smoked sausage, 1 (40% larger than normal sized) cream of mushroom soup,1 can condensed french onion soup, large onion chopped, lots of garlic powder.  Put it in the crockpot til well cooked!  Will be on the regular rotation...

Very easy to put together, especially with those pre-cubed potatoes you can get in the produce section now. Doing this in a slow cooker, it probably needs stirred at least once midway through cooking time as the potatoes on the bottom were a little mushy and the ones on the top were less cooked. But very nice blend of flavors -- would probably like better with a little more sauce as well. Will have to try the oven method next time too.

Absolutely delicious! I added some carrots and used sweet italian sausage. My family loved it!

I just want to add... It's been a year since I first made this and it has become a regular meal in my house. We have it at leat once a month. We all love it and it comes out perfect everytime. Very eay prep. A long cooking time, but hey, it gives me time to do other things since it is basically set it and forget it.

You really can't mess this up and it is soooo tasty. Makes it's own gravy too.

The only thing I might suggest since I do it in the oven id to take the foil of for the last 15 or 20 minutes to let the top brown. 

It is a little too much food for my small family but I still make the full recipe, in fact I might even increase it a bit, but it freezes well, so I don't mind.

Quick and easy recipe.  My kids love it.  I've made this several times with the beef soup.  One night I did not have beef soup on hand so I tried Campbell's Southwestern chicken soup...BETTER YET! Adds wonderful flavor.  I also use more sausage than called for (2 #) and add fresh sliced mushrooms.  Top with shredded cheddar cheese, perfect!

i got this recipe when i was looking for crock pot recipes.  The vegetable soup kind of threw me at first, but since it seemed a cheap meal to make i decided to give it a try.  My children just loved it.  my 2 year old is very picky about what she eats, but she just loved it.  the only change i made was to add a can of whole kernal corn because my husband loves corn. thanks for the great recipe!!!

My boyfriend and I loved this recipe. It was very easy to make, although I might recommend spraying the baking dish with cooking spray before baking.

This is very good and super easy!  The only thing I added was an onion because anything that has potatoes just has to have one : )
Thanks for the great recipe

I made it in the crock pot.  We thought it was very good, but I think if I was going to make it again, I would add more vegetables.  I might even try it with beef instead of sausage.

Was looking for a different way to prepare the meat I had defrosted... Johnsonville Farms Zesty Italian Sausage... and utilize the few items left in the pantry. Came up with this recipe on the ingredient search. Man, I'll tell you, honestly... I figured this would be a so-so meal... in fact, it was surprisingly delish! Added a sliced onion, two cloves of minced garlic, a splash of worcestershire, a bag of frozen peas and doubled the soups. Will try with green beans next time. Cooked it in the crockpot all day (about 8 hours). SO GOOD! My husband was just thrilled with this "happenstance" meal. And it's so darned EASY! Thanks for sharing, Chris!

Delicious! I used cream of chicken instead of mushroom and cooked it in the crockpot. A lot of other reviews said it's missing something and I think I have found the missing piece! After it was finished cooking in the crockpot, I put it in a casserol dish, put about of cup of shredded cheese and about 1/2 cup of seasoned bread crumbs and broiled it on low for 3-4 minutes, just until the cheese melts and browns a little. The cheese was a wonderful addition and couldn't imagine it without it!

Good basic supper recipe.  I didn't have vegetable soup so I added a can of corn and a can of green beans, both drained.  I also used dry onion soup mix for flavor with a little water.

I have to admit this isn't my favorite because I'm not a sausage fan but when it comes to preparation and picky childen (my husband loves it too) it's served on a regular basis.  Use low-sodium ingredients or it will be salty.  5 stars for simplicity.

I thought that this was a simple and yummy dish.  I used beef broth instead of the vegetable beef soup, and added fresh mushrooms, carrots, canned corn, onion and garlic.  I covered it with aluminum foil and cooked it in the oven for about an hour.  I took it to a church lunch and it went over very well.  A nice, hearty meal with lots of possibilities.

Every picky eater in my house devoured this dish! I took advice from some of the other comments and altered the recipe slightly. I used two packages of kielbasa, the potatoes as written, one can of cream of mushroom soup, one can of beef consumme, one package of frozen mixed veggies, and a good sprinkling of salt, fresh ground white pepper, and dried parsley. And this was oh so good with a nice fresh loaf of French bread.

I made this in the slow cooker and, based on other reviewers' suggestions, added chopped onion, a drained can of corn, and a 1 lb. bag of baby carrots on top of the sausage, in that order.  I also mixed the mushroom and vegetable beef soups together in a small bowl before adding them on top.  It did taste good when it was done, but a little on the dry, thick side.  I'm thinking maybe something like a cup of beef broth might have helped sauce it up a bit.  The French onion soup, that other reviewers suggested, in place of the veggie soup might have done the trick, too, because it's a more liquidy soup to begin with.  I also think it could have used some spices to jazz it up, maybe some black pepper or garlic or onion powder.  If you make this in a slow cooker, I would recommend keeping the cooking time closer to the low end (6 hours) rather than the high end (8 hours).  I went right down the middle with 7 hours, and if I would have cooked it that extra hour, it would have ended up way too dry.

I made this recipe as-is except I used frozen diced potatoes. It came out fantastic. I too, was skeptical about the vegetable soup, but some how it worked. My husbanded raved about it too. This is definitely a keeper!

Yum!  I loved it!  This has quickly become one of our favorites in our household. 
I also omitted the vegetable soup and added a 1/2 can of water to it.  Much better
that way.

Made this last year for a pot luck party and it was a big hit!  A great starter recipe that you can adjust to your taste.
Making it again tonight for another pot luck party!  Should be another big hit with this meat & potatoes crowd!

I really had to change it around due to time constraints, but thank you for the basic idea!  I used turkey sausage and 1 can cream of potato soup, since that is what I had.  Added onion and fresh mushrooms and a dash of worcestershire sauce.  I cooked it in a skillet for about 30 minutes (til potatoes were tender), covering halfway through.

So easy - and so good. I'm not a big fan of sausage, but my husband is. He LOVED this, and even I liked it. Leftovers kept great for lunch the next day. I did as previous posters suggested - used onion soup instead of vegetable beef soup. The only kind I had on hand was a packet of dry mix - so I made the soupo and boiled it down to be thicker (guess I could have just used less water). . Also - I added some frozen veggies, too. Next time I'll try some fresh carrots along with the frozen veggies. There will definitely be many "next time"s!

Awesome dish..The whole family loved it. Followed the recipe to the tee but added a can of whole corn to add more veggies. This is one recipe I will definitely make again and again. Oh yea also spreaded shredded cheese over it at the end.

Very tasty, easy to make, and easy to customize. Found this recipe while looking for a way to use up a bunch of potatoes. I skipped the condensed vegetable beef soup and added a can of chicken broth, a diced onion, and a bunch of fresh green beans cut into thirds. I sprinkled some shredded mozzarella in my bowl. My husband and I both loved it.

After reading the reviews I thought this was going to be good, but I didn't like it at all. No one in my family liked it. I also found it to be very salty, maybe because of the beef soup and kielbasa is salty anyway. i can't put my finger on what was wrong. I followed the recipe as is. will not be making again.

I was in a hurry and cooked it on the stove. Next time I'll try baking or slow cooking as suggested. I added mixed frozen vegetable to give it more color and flavor.It was yummy.

We enjoyed this recipe.  I did change somethings.  I used 2 packages of beef sausage, 2 cans of mushroom soup, 2 cans of vegetable beef soup, about a 1/2 cup water, also used a 5 pound bag of potatoes (the potatoes were small). I added in fresh carrots, onion, green pepper, 1 can of corn, frozen peas.  For seasoning I added roasted garlic and herb, pepper, also Emerils original essence.  I baked covered for 1 hour 45 minutes, then added some cheese, put back in oven for about 10 minutes, uncovered.  It was great; very flavorful.  I served with French Rolls.  My husband and toddler both had seconds. Hubby said this is a dish that he would like to have again. I was a bit skeptical about trying this recipe, but it is definitely worth it. It is a great base recipe to add your favorites to. Thanks for the recipe.

This is a very cool recipe.   Since I didn't have a can of vegetable beef soup I replaced it with a can of mixed vegetables.   I also  replaced the smoked sausage with bulk Italian sausage and I cooked it first.    After mixing all the ingredients together I topped it with some grated sharp cheddar cheese, covered it and cooked in the oven.   I will, the next time, try this in the crockpot.   I think this is the perfect recipe for this.

I almost forgot, I also added a few drops of habanero sauce when mixing this up.   This gave it a bit of a zing.   

We loved it.

I used a bag of southern style hashbrowns, added a can of corn, added cheese to the top at the end of the cooking time and only baked it for 1 hour instead of the full time. Family loved it!

This was REALLY easy to do...and easy to adapt to what you have at home! I used 1/2 lb of smoked sausage, 1/2 lb of pork (it's what I had on hand), a can of cream of chicken, and a can of fiesta nacho cheese---my kids loved it! It turned out great.

This was pretty good.  It is sort of like beef stew but creamy and with sausage.  I did change it .... I didn't use veg beef soup instead I put dry onion soup mix and used a bigger can of cream of mushroom.  For the sausage I used the smoked sausage with cheese in it.  I also added carrots and corn.

I only give this a 3/5 because it's OVERPOWERINGLY salty, even having used reduced sodium condensed soups. We did double the sausage, too. I would make something similar to this again, but I don't think I'd make it this way again. It's a good base recipe, though.

I'm giving this a four rating because my husband really liked it. I personally think it needs a little more spice, for me it was rather bland, but certainly a fast dinner to make. I had left over baked potatos that I normally fry, but used this instead. Since every thing was already cooked I left it on 350o for 45 minutes. It makes a lot, were having it for lunch today and then freezing it for a future dinner.

Excellent recipe.  I made only a couple of minor changes.  First, I used low-sodium beef broth and condensed mushroom soup to make it more heart-friendly.  Second, I added half a pound of fresh mushrooms.  Great stuff.  Thanks for the recipe.

Went by the recipe pretty much and added one whole chopped onion. Very tasty, did not notice too much salt. This is a good recipe for couples on the go. Prepare the night before, put it on the crockpot before leaving for work, set it on low heat and its ready when you get home. Enjoy

This was a very easy recipe.  However I feel it was a bit too salty.  Maybe next time I will use a low sodium veggie soup.  And to shorten the baking time, I boiled the potatoes for a bit and then added them to the mix.  I also put the sausage in a fry pan and warmed it a bit to get some of the grease out and then dumped it on paper towels.  Then I put the sausage in the casserole.  My father in law loved it, my husband said it was ok, and Im kinda in the ok too.  So I made it as is except for the pre cooking the potatoes and meat, and it is very flavorful.  But Im only going 4 stars because of the saltiness. I will make it again though.

A simple and good crockpot recipe. It was a bit salty and the sausage got a little overdone around the edges, but overall a good, cheap recipe. Thanks!

I made the crockpot version and this turned out really delicious :) This recipe had lots of flavor and was filling. The only changes I made was to add a medium onion, parsley flakes, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. I will recommend this recipe to others as an inexpensive and delicious recipe.  Thank you for sharing :)

Pretty good recipe, easy to make.  I used trader joes sweet italian chicken sausage which gave it a nice flavor, not too salty, not too bland.  I did not use as many potatoes and added some veggies.

This recipe really doesn't have much going for it.  I made it in a crockpot and it didn't have much flavor, except for when you got a bite of sausage.  My family asked for me NOT to make this again.

Good comfort food meal.  I used sweet Italian sausage & added canned mushrooms because that is what I had on hand.  Very good and very easy!  I think next time I will throw in some carrots and/or peas to make it more like a pot roast recipe.

This was okay-probably wouldn't cook it again.  I used bratwurst and had a side of sauerkraut with it which made it interesting.  It needs something more - like spice or garlic.

Pretty good and easy to make. I think next time I'll spice it up with some spices...not for sure which ones yet but I'm sure I'll think of something! Kid friendly, the 1 yr old really liked it...the potatoes were perfectly tenderized for her. Thanks Chris for posting this good recipe!!!

Great basic dish, made many times. I’ve used different sausages and added different veggies but what I found my family likes best is Eckridge all beef skinless sausage. Doesn’t turn out salty or greasy. The recipe is good and simple but I do like to add garlic powder, fresh ground black pepper and onion powder with a dash of Italian seasoning. Sometimes add can of corn or can of mixed veggies depending on what’s on hand. Haven’t made in a crockpot yet, but usually takes less then an hour and a half in the oven uncovered....depends on potato cube size. We enjoy and smells awesome while cooking. Thanks for the recipe:D

Was a bit skeptical at first, but wow! The gravy was really good!  I would definitely add more sausage than the recipe calls for, and I think in going to add green beans the next time.

Wonderful flavor. Wife and kids had seconds. Cooked on the stove in a Dutch Oven with the lid on. Brought it to a boil then turned it down to a simmer for 45 mins. Added fresh diced carrots and corn. Came out perfect

I seriously had my doubts read the reviews and gave it a try. So GOOD! I didnt have vegetable soup so i subbed a half a packet of beefy onion soup mix with half cup of water. I added Garlic fresg ground black pepper as well and greenbeans in the crockpot on high. I added cheddar cheese towards the end.AWESOME!

okay, I admit this didn't sound very good to me, but it had so many good reviews, and I had all the ingredients, so I decided to give it a shot.  I did make some changes, but not a lot.  I used about half the potatoes and sausage because I didn't want to make too much if no one liked it.  I also used the whole amount of the soups to make it more saucy.  I added a huge heaping tablespoon of chopped garlic, and then, in the last 20 minutes in the oven, I covered it with a good light amount of shredded mozzarella and an even heavier amount of shredded sharp cheddar.  The end result was a delicious dish that had a very cheesy gravy.  Very rich and sooo amazing!!!  This will be in our regular schedule from now on for sure!!

My whole family loved this! I used sweet sausage, red potatoes, 2 cans of vegetable beef soup, and added frozen corn. I was nervous about the potatoes because I checked on it every hour or so and the potatoes weren't getting soft at all (about 3 hours before the soup was ready they started to soften). I turned the slow cooker on high about 2 hours before done. I will be making this again and again.

I had everything on hand so I threw this together, skeptical about the combo of ingredients and how it would taste. It was excellent! Hubby and a very picky autistic 6 year old loved it! Next time I will add some fresh or frozen green beans. I think they will go well with the dish.

I think this is a really good, versatile recipe.  I used half sliced carrots and half diced potatoes, added an onion, and used a heavy hand in the seasonings (paprika, garlic powder, black pepper, and parsley).  I used one can of cream of mushroom and one can of broccoli cheese soup and added 1/2 cup of sour cream.  Sprinkled sharp cheddar cheese on top.  Baked it an hour and 15 minutes with foil on top, then an extra 15 minutes to brown.

It's a good base recipe with variations on the soups for whatever you have.  My "men" of the house gobbled this up and then some.  It didn't blow my socks off, but it definitely was not bad.

This recipe was just OK.  I didn't like the over powering taste of the canned vegetable beef soup.  Perhaps next time I will use a different soup in place of that one.

This is very tasty and very versatile.  I cooked mine in my slow cooker.  I took some shortcuts like others and used the frozen Potatoes O'Brien.  The added onion and peppers in the potatoes just add another layer of flavor.  I also added some cabbage since my family loves it and a small can of diced green chilis.  I like that this recipe can be made exactly as written for a nice dinner or varied to suit any family's tastes.  I'm sure we will have this often.  Thank you!

Instead of the vegetable beef soup, I used beef broth and added my own veggies: bell pepper, carrot, onion, and garlic. I didn't have cream of mushroom so I used cream of asparagus and it was delicious! I also micro-waved the potatoes and it cut down my over all baking time.

It's hard to find a recipe that doesn't get overcooked and dry after 10+ hours in the crockpot (until I get home from work.) This recipe is perfect for the crockpot and is so simple! Added potatoes, sliced smoked bratwurst, cream of celery soup, beef broth and onion soup mix (instead of the vegetable beef soup.) I also added in some baby carrots so it was more than just meat and potatoes. Next time I'm going to use French Onion soup and add corn.

The ingredients were a great blend, however, I thought was a little soupy to put in tortillias.  The flavors were so good though and we used it as a dip, and wow, that was wonderful.  Will use it as a dip from now on....I added just a little enchilata sauce on top, otherwise I followed directions exactly.

What an unusual recipe!  I followed it exactly the first time and it came out really good, leftovers were great too!  I think I'll try experimenting with it next time but it is a great basic recipe! (Oh I might cut back on the potatoes.  I love potatoes, but try to watch how much of them I eat, might want to substitute some of the potatoes with some other veggies.)

I thought this wasn't bad.  If I make this again, I would add some extra veggies.  Something along the lines of carrots and corn.  It's nice to toss it all in the crock pot and not worry about "What's for dinner?"

This was a good recipe. We both felt it was missing something. I really think it needed some veggies besides what was in the soup. I will make this again but will add a few things to it next time.

This was pretty good. I didn't have a can of beef vegatable so I added fresh carrots, celery, onion and some beef stock instead. Made in the crock pot- I was on a time crunch so I cooked 4 hours on high and it was done. Good for afternoon football game!

We did the crockpot version, and like another poster I went with the Southwestern Chicken soup just b/c it sounded better with that. It was excellent and very very easy!

Good cold weather meal.  I didn't use quite as many potatoes cuz I ran out but didn't notice. I did cook this in the crock pot and 8 hours on low was a bit much.  The pototes were a bit mushy but still had very good flavor.  Will certainly make again!  Thanks!

Very good! Good for fall nights. The only thing different for me was it took over 2hrs and 15min to cook the potatoes.

I did this in our slow cooker and it came out salty. I used kielbasa and followed the direction to a tea. It was easy. Maybe if I used the italian sausage it would have been better.

Absolutely wonderful. Thank you so much for sharing a great recipe. I used Smoked Sausage that had two large links in the package and used all of it, used the same soups and added a half of a can of corn at the end of the cooking time. Added a little water during cooking and a little milk towards the end. Served with Garlic Bread fresh out of the oven and it was excellent/ Super comfort food especially in this cold weather!thnks again, Peggy in TX

A bit gooey/casserol-y for me, but good comfort food on a cold night. Of course, I live in Phx., AZ so there aren't many cold nights. :) I think it's a better dish for those of you who live somewhere cold! :)

My husband raved over this but I thought it was just ok.  I used breakfast sausage (that comes in the 1 pound roll) and crumbled that up as I browned it, then I added it to the potatoes and soup.  I'll make it again because my husband liked it so much.

I was quite pleasantly surprised at how tasty such a rather plebian sounding dish actually was. Easy to prepare. No muss, no fuss. Great for a busy weeknight or any time you don't have the inspiration or energy.

The ease of this recipe was what caught my eye.  I changed it omitting the veg-beef soup, adding a half can of water and also used fat free soup, which was a mistake because by the time it was supposed to be finished, the dish was still watery and not creamy (I had to thicken with rue).  BUT, I believe if I'd just put in two cans of regular cream of mushroom soup, it would have turned out fine.  Everybody enjoyed the meal and I will certainly make again!

I thought it was very tasty.  The one thing I thought I may do the next time, though, is to add another pound of kielbasa.

Actually made the other similar recipe on this site without the soups.  Used 9 Italian sausages and had one left.  Was very good. Added carrots and more spices.  Filled my white roaster.

I used 1.5 pounds sliced kielbasa, one can condensed cream of mushroom soup, one 19-oz can campbells beef vegetable soup,  about 7 small-to-medium white potatoes scrubbed (unpeeled) and cubed, 3/4 cup water, 1.5 teaspoons garlic powder, 1/2 cup chopped onion; I cooked this in a slow cooker for about 6 hours. It's a hearty thick soup-stew that is a good base for adding other veggies or beans, my family ate it up and I will make it again.

My husband hates hot peppers.  A friend of his left us 2 smoked sausages with jalapeños & cheese & I was happy to find this.  I made it last week...he ate a plate full & had the leftovers the next day for lunch.  It was easy to make &  the sauce & potatoes tampered down the jalapeños.

I used ingredients that I had on hand. Substituted with cream of chicken soup, a can of mixed veggies instead of vegetable beef soup, golden potatoes and added a package of cooked Italian sausage along with the smoked sausage. Threw in 8 oz of sour cream and a little chicken stock. My family ate every last bite and asked for me to make it again soon! It was a great comfort food dish!

I made this according to the directions for a slow cooker. Super easy which was great and the house smelled great after 5 hours. My only recommendation is to use low sodium soup, if you can find it. While we all liked it, it was a bit too salty.

Used french onion soup and I think that's what made it unbearable. Tasted overly peppery and I did not add salt or pepper. Husband really didn't like it. Asked if it was some sort of German dish.

I'll definitely make this one again.  I changed up the recipe a little by using two cans rather than one of the  vegetable beef.  I also simply used a bag of hash brown potatoes (southern style) rather than chopping potatoes - simple!

February 2, 2016, My daughter was having a spinal tap today and I knew I wouldn't have time to make dinner with her aftercare. I wanted something different to make with kielbasa and found this recipe. I didn't have much time to read the reviews but I had the ingredients on hand so I went with it. I used 8 small russet potatoes, 2 cans of vegetable soup, 1 can of cream of mushroom, 1 can of cream of mushroom with garlic, garlic salt, pepper and salt on the potatoes. I put a quarter cup of water and a dash of milk in because it seemed appropriate. I used 2 sausages. Later, after reading the reviews, I called my son to add a package of dry onion soup mix and a couple handfuls of baby carrots. My husband and two young men sons are it all up. I will be making it again. As it happened it turn out to be a rainy day too!

This was amazing.  I changed the cream of mushroom to cream of cheddar soup.  Doubled the recipe made some in the crock pot and oven bc  everyone wanted some more.

The baking time was too long.  The Kielbasa started too burn at 75 minutes. The dish was too dry so I added 2 cups of chicken broth to the leftovers and it turned out much better. I will make it again, but bake for an hour and add chicken broth for moistness.

I wasn't sure how this was going to taste but it looked so easy I decided to give it a try. I cubed the potatoes very small so it would cook in a shorter time. Even though I cubed the potatoes small it still took almost 2 hours for them to be tender enough for my taste. About 1/2 way through cooking time I stirred everything up and then decided that there wasn't going to be enough sauce. I didn't have another can of vegetable beef soup so I used a can of plain vegetable soup and another can of mushroom soup mixed up. This made the casserole nice and saucy. Next time I will use plain vegetable soup instead of vegetable beef to save some cost. This will be going into my regular meal plan. Delicious and so very easy to make. Next time I'll give the slow cooker method a try and definitely use the double sauce. Thanks for this one Chris.

I made it in the oven. Hubby loved it. But it doesn't need to be in the oven that long. I took it out way before and it was already burning. But pretty good simple recipe

In-laws liked it and i did substitute the veggie soup for condensed french onion. I did add garlic powder and corn, but it still needs something to make it 5 star. You do need to stir to get all the potatoes cooked the same. Overall a good recipe!

This is a quick and easy recipe.  Using a slow cooker, I microwaved briefly the potatoes, and slightly the carrots.  This shortened the cooking time.  Most vegetables will be good in this recipe.  I used some carrots and minced garlic.

My family loved this! I sliced (skin on) the potatoes and cooked in the oven in a large cast iron skillet. Topped with cheese the last few minutes of cooking. Fantastic! Will make again.

Very yummy! I used probably twice the amount of sausage and added some garlic powder. Cooked it in my slow cooker for 1.5 on high and 2 hours on low. We loved it!

Had to make quite a few changes....added Corn, Onions, Carrots for variety...added Worchestshire, Pepper, Garlic, Paprika and Horseradish for flavor.  Took about 2 1/2 hours to cook in the oven to make sure the potatoes were cooked through.  Will make again, but wasn't a big hit with the family.

This is very very good. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It has become my favorite recipe and I am not a fan of sausage. I loved it as the original recipe called for and can't hardly wait to make it again.

My family really liked this dish. Although, I only had to add 5 potatoes instead of 8. It browned very nice, and mixed very well with the soups, but I would add a bit extra to make it more creamy.

I used two cans of cream of mushroom and opted not to use the vegetable soup. I also added 8 oz. of sour cream. It was very creamy and very good flavor with using the spicy venison sausage. I think I'll try the italian sausage next time and use the vegetable soup.

I would make this again, however, I think I would cut back on the potatoes and add more carrots and sausage.  I did add those this time, but they just seemed overwhelmed by all of the potatoes.  I took other folks advice and substituted the beef soup with french onion soup, and that was a good choice.  I may even add a can or 2 of corn also the next go around.

It didn't last very long.  First word was Yum!  I added some fresh brocolli, sliced carrots and canned corn as others noted.  I baked it for about 1-1/2 hrs with the last 15 minutes not covered (to lightly brown).  Served it with french bread.  It was easy to prepare, very good and family members really enjoyed it. It's a keeper.

I used cream of chicken soup and a can of beef broth.  It was okay.  I probably won't make it again.  Maybe it would have been better had I followed the items on the recipe but I used what I had available at home.  I also used chopped onion, celery and 1/2 teaspoon of minced garlic and cooked it overnight in the slow cooker.

How could I reduce the enormous amount of sodium in this? Well, I would get the low sodium soups or make my own sauces of the same ingredients minus most of the salt. The sausage itself provides plenty salt. Sounds really tasty as well as quick to make. I will try it! Husband loves sausages!

Very few ingredients deliver big taste!  I had some of Emeril's spicy sausages on hand so I used those.  I also didn't have any vegetable beef soup, so I used some beef broth instead and some spices and it came out great. My cooker took a long time on low, however, (9 hrs. and the potatoes were still a little firm) so I need to crank up the heat next time.

My family really loved this recipe!!  I omitted the vegetable beef soup and added one half can of water instead.  I also sprinkled one half teaspoon of celery seeds along with salt and pepper over the potatoes.  I this served with a tossed salad and french bread.  It was a really winner!  Thanks for sharing.

Wow! Is this yummy! We're cheese lovers, so we topped ours with mild cheddar for some cheesy goodness!

Although this recipe was very easy and the cooking time correct for slow cooker, my husband and I did not care for the flavor.  It may have tasted better with different kind of soup instead of veg-beef but I don't know what kind I would use.
