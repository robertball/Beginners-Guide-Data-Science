Fantastic! A great drink that is equally great when frozen into slushies. Thank you for the recipe.

I wasn't sure about this one, but it wasn't bad. I actually liked the spice of the cayenne in this. It was oddly refreshing! I wouldn't drink this all the time, but it was nice for something different. Thanks for sharing. :)
