Very good. A nice change from typical cukes in sour cream.  
Note: Yesterday I gave this 4 stars.  It is very good.  I made it in the afternoon, and it sat in the fridge maybe 3 hours until we ate it.  
However, today when I ate the few leftovers that remained, I must say this salad REALLY improved overnight.   I suggest if possible, make it a day ahead of serving.  Delicious!  Thank you for sharing!

I thought this was pretty good. I only had 1 English cucumber. So, I had to reduce the rest of the ingredients. I did 1 roma tomato and clove of garlic, 1/8 of a white onion, 2 pinches of sea salt, and 3 tablespoons each of lite mayo and Trader Joes Balsalmic Italian dressing. It made 3 servings. It was a nice change to lemon or sour cream dressings.

I made this, but made some changes. I diced up 3 cucumbers, diced up 1 red onion into long pieces, 2 lbs. of medium shrimp, peeled and deveined. 1cup mayo, 3/4 cup zesty Italian dressing, 1 tsp. salt, 1 tsp pepper. Mixed it all up and put in refrigerator for a couple of hours. When served I sprinkled Parmesan chees over the top. Had lots of people wanting the recipe. I think the original recipe with the 1 tbs of salt was Way to much.

I left out the garlic since there's already garlic in the Italian dressing, and I used cherry tomatoes cut in half.

This is very delicious. I like to use this when I get tired of my other cucumber salad.  I will be making this a lot in the future.

I made this for the family and was floored to see my three year old and one year old finish it and ask for more.  They are the pickiest eaters I know.  Will definetly make it again.

Absolutely love this! Fresh cucumber and tomatoes completely set this over the top. I always add more tomatoes because that's my favorite fruit/vegetable :)

Thought the tablespoon of salt was way too much. It tasted very salty to us. If I made it again, I would reduce the salt and also reduce the amount of dressing.

This recipe was delicious!  I served it to a group of men, and I got rave reviews!  I made the recipe as written, and I especially liked the sauce - very different than the traditional recipe with red wine vinegar.  I'll definitely make it again.

One of my friends gave me some fresh tomatoes and cucumbers from her garden, so I was looking for something a little different to do with them. HOLY COW, I'm so glad I chose this recipe, it is delicious. I had some left over, but a lot more dressing than veggies, so I just added some extra tomatoes and cukes the next day, let it chill a while and it was every bit as good as the first day. Mine was quite runny but I think even more so as my tomatoes were quite ripe and juicy, didn't matter, just served it in a bowl on the side.

Very good recipe. I waited a day before trying thanks to another reviewer's advice. I'll probably cut down the liquids by at least 25% next time - there is a lot of juice in the salad. Very flavorful, might be too strong for some, so you could cut back on the pepper, salt and garlic.
