I was attracted to this recipe because it could be easily modified to fit my diet.  However, if this dish were unhealthy, I would *still* be eating it - my family is addicted.

I believe that fresh garlic should always be used instead of powder.  Substitute 4 cloves minced fresh garlic for the garlic powder to make a huge flavor impact.  This important modification makes the dish taste like you ordered it at a fine restaurant!

I also didn't feel that the lemon pepper contributed positively, so I removed it the next time I made it.

Also, I like celery in my chicken salad so I added it.  I felt that the flavor and color contrasted nicely with the other ingredients.

Thanks for this most excellent recipe!

I absolutely adore this salad. It is a nice change of pace from the traditional chicken salad, and everyone I've served it to just raves. I highly recommend it! It's got a very nice and zesty zing to it that sets it apart from the numerous bland chicken salads out there.

Served this recipe at a baby shower.  Everyone loved it ... it was quite a change from traditional mayonaise based chicken salad.  Everyone appreciated the change!

I thought it was pretty good. I added celery which was good. To make it even more healthy I put in on a spinach tortilla along with shredded lettuce and rolled it into a wrap.

I had to make a few changes just because of ingredients that I didn't have, but mine was close and it was so good.  Much better than the traditional mayo based chicken salad.

My husband and I loed this chicken!  I did not use the honey due to diet restrictions, but it was fantastic without it!  Grilled on our GF grill, served with a salad.

Thank you so much for posting the recipe!!

This is a very tasty variation of chicken salad.  I used hulled pistachio nuts instead of cashews and it made it a classy dish.

I did modify a bit but everyone went on and on through out dinner saying how good it was and asked me to make it for our upcoming party.
I think grilling the chicken makes it soooo good. 
I've been craving it ever since we made it a week ago!

My family didn't like this dish.  We prefer the mayo version - southern style.  Maybe use canned chicken or cut chicken up really small.  I didn't think there was enough moisture to saturate all of the chicken.

Great flavors! I love the marinade and the dressing! To add some color and bulk to the salad, I added diced celery and orange bell peppers. This make a fantastic lunch, I will have enough for the whole week for myself!

This was a great change from traditional chicken salad. Both my husband and my 4 year old loved this!  I made a few changes (I didn't have time to marinate, so I just mixed the marinade and sauteed the chicken over the stove in that.  I used celery instead of grapes.  It turned out great! I love that it is healthier than the traditional version.

Cut honey minimally. Otherwise excellent on boston lettuce. No lemon pepper used, fresh rather than powder garlic, one bud, and a squirt of fresh lemon.  That really topped it off.

This is amazing!  Unlike any chicken salad I've had, it has wonderful citrus notes from the lemon zest and lemon pepper.  I did have to make one substitution because I forgot to buy red grapes:  fresh blueberries.  Lemon and blueberry pair wonderfully together, and while I would like to try this with grapes, it was incredible!  The dressing makes this salad.  This recipe will go in my family-favorite craveworthy file.  It's perfect if you want to impress someone with a different and delicious meal.  THANKS!

This is a good recipe.  I would make it again and it is nice that is is so much healthier than usual chicken salad recipes.  But I didn't think it was AWESOME.

Quite tasty,  I didn't have any lemon pepper so I used some lemon juice and black pepper.  I served it over a bed of mixed salad greens.

I used four boneless chicken breasts, which I cubed prior to marinating, more surface area for the marinade to work on and coat.  I doubled the ingredients for the marinade/sauce.  I used my cast iron grill griddle.  I did trade blueberries for the grapes and added a little fresh lemon juice to the marinade.  I like lemon and blueberry together.  I'm sure I didn't manage 2tsps of zest which is why I added some lemon juice.  Toasted the cashews.  I too added some celery for crunch. Left out the lemon pepper, I don't have that seasoning. I doubt I missed anything.  This is really good tasting warm or cold.  I taste tested it warm after I cooked and combined ingredients, and for dinner we had it cold on top of salad greens. It's added to my recipe box.

Awesome recipe...the lemon zest is a must, do not substitute for full flavor! Also it tastes better with real garlic (4 cloves as someone above mentioned) instead of powder.
