The mission of using this recipe was to try and use up leftovers.  The only substitution we made was to use a cup of regular milk in place of evaporated milk.  It turned out surprisingly well.  Usually we cook with a lot of spices, but we just added some ground pepper to the top and my husband and I both went back for seconds.  

My one comment about the instructions was that I did not know whether to bake it with the lid on or off, and tried with the lid on.  In 50 minutes, the casserole hadn't set, so I had to bake it another 20 with the lid off.  I think in the future I would try this recipe with shredded potatoes rather than rice, just for the texture.  

Thanks for sharing, BABYPHAT55!

There were no spices. I used a can of corn because my husband does not eat peas. I topped it off with cubed hash browns and sprayed oil on them to insure browning. The reason I topped them was to keep the vegetables from drying out and becoming hard little nuggets in the dish. But I would make it again and my way.

This was great, however I added fresh broccoli and doubled the cheese.  It still turned out great.  I also used brown minute rice, which I cooked first then added and everything turned out fine.  Will make again when I have left over turkey!

Turned out great- hubby loved it!  I made as it was written except I used just peas - no mixed veggies because they weren't on hand. In the future I'd sauté the onions in butter (and maybe throw some celery in as well) before adding.

A little bland, but pretty good.  Would at least add some spices next time.

Family loved this. I didn't have evaporated milk, so used ordinary milk, and it worked just fine. I also added some seasonings - sage, salt and pepper - to the mix. It was easy to prepare, and really tasty! I will definitely be making this one regularly!

I am sorry but I did not like it.  The rice absorbed most of the moisture, causing it to be dry and not sticking together.  Taste was o.k.  I added salt and pepper to taste as there is non listed in the ingredients.  Thank you for posting the recipe, gave it an extra star.

Super easy! I tripled the batch since I wanted leftovers. I used Aldi's Supergrains that I already had on hand instead of the rice. I substituted cream (we have a cow) for the evaporated milk. I used a Mexican Blend for the cheese (already on hand). And I added 1 Tbsp of salt & 1 tsp pepper, noticing there were no spices. It's in the oven now. I'll update after tonight's dinner.
It was sooooo delicious! It was the right amount of salt & pepper to add (1 tsp salt  & 1/3 tsp pepper per batch). There was less than 1 batch left for lunch leftovers (feeding a family of 7)!

It was very tasty but added more cheese and spices.  My husband  enjoyed it and it made over 2 meals for the two of us.

This was very moist and tasty.  I used brown rice and taking others’ advice I added pepper, cumin, garlic powder and provincial seasoning. I also added fresh mushrooms because I had some.  I substituted mixed veggies with fresh chopped broccoli. I would definitely make again.

This was good. I used up the extras I had on hand. I had Fritos on hand as well so crunched up several handfuls for topping. It was in for 45 minutes but needed to go in 10-15 min longer to be hot. Maybe a little bland but we can’t handle much spice. We will make it again.

This has no flavor, it was very bland. Maybe with garlic and other seasonings it would be better. very disappointing.

I was looking for a recipe that used left over turkey,, THIS IS THE RECIPE!!   I dont like to rate a recipe that I change, but it was so interesting and seemed easy to convert, I had to give it a try.   after reading the reviews, I did make several variations due to what I had on hand: I used broccoli florets as veggies, added 1 tbs each poultry seasoning, celery salt, and sage, salt and pepper. I didn't have the cheese, so I melted 1 cup Velveta@ cheese, mixed in the milk til smooth  and added the rest, stirred it all together, and topped it with French's@real red pepper crunchy topping..  What a fantastic recipe!! and so versatile!! its definitely a KEEPER!!

This was really tasty and a great way to use up leftovers.  I didn't expect so much flavor.  Used regular milk and Velveeta because I didn't have the cheeses on hand and still came out great.  Will make this again.

Husband and daughter loved it.  I used a can of corn instead of mixed vegetables and added bacon bits that I had on hand.  I forgot to add the green chilis but was still yummy without them.

I expected leftovers from this turkey leftover casserole. Second helpings for everyone and it was gone!  THIS is a keeper for my leftover turkey. I substituted some things for other leftovers - like creamed peas instead of mixed veggies, and I had cheddar  & Mozzarella on hand. Loved this!

Excellent! I had most of the ingredients but used cumin instead of cilantro. Also added sun dried tomatoes. I only made half the recipe but it turned out great. Almost ate the whole thing. Managed to keep 1/3 for leftovers. I was stuffed.. I will make this again, for sure.

Simple, yummy, and an easy way to use leftover turkey. I didn't use the cilantro or green chiles. I used brown rice and totally forgot the melted butter (oops!)
I added about 1/4 tsp salt, pinch of basil, 1/8 tsp of ground garlic, and a dash of ground black pepper.
I will definitely be making this again!

We liked it.  We will probably make it again.  Loved the ease of mixing everything together.  Next time I would use a flat pan as I had to bake it 30 minutes longer at a higher temperature (400 degrees).  That probably won't be necessary with a flat pan.  I could always decrease the amount of evaporated milk.  We like things non-soupy.

This was great! I followed the recipe exactly and the only change I would make next time would be to sauté the onions prior to adding them as my husband does not like them crunchy. My son ate two bowls he loved it so much, five starts from us!
