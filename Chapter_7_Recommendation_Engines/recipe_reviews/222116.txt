Well done...I love this recipe...the only changes I made:

-spray the baking dish with cooking spray

-I prefer fuschilli pasta over elbow

-use olive oil/truffle oil instead of butter, and add chopped onions (1/2-3/4 cup) and saut√© in the olive oil...add cheeses and melt...remove from heat...add scrambled eggs and then cooked macaroni...adding  salt and pepper to taste.

-I sprinkle the top lightly with panko bread crumbs and paprika...and bake.

Very dry and not much flavor- even with all those different cheeses. Not enough liquid to see it "bubble" when baking or to keep it from drying out.

I made this and will make it again with tweaks. The cheeses didn't melt and I will cook the sauce on the stove top so it's a sauce first. I didn't seem to have enough sauce for the pasta. But the funny thing is we ate it all and it tasted good. Just didn't have the cheesy look. Easy to fix.

Not worth the effort. No taste.

It was pretty good, although if i make it again i will not use the mustard. It was very strong. Other than that, it was good.

Bland and gummy.  This recipe lacks the flavor and comfort that is baked macaroni and cheese.  It needs something to liven it up. I served it with stewed tomatoes and it didn't help much.

Not what I expected. Pretty dry, not creamy.
