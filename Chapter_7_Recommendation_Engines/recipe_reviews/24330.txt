This was quick and easy and good.  I chop the sweet potatoes (with the skin still on) into 2" thick circles, and then cut the circles in half, before boiling them in an enormous stockpot-- this makes the boiling time really fast.  After they are boiled, the skin practically falls off, which saves you the effort of peeling them beforehand.  Based on the reviews, I reduced the butter and sugar all the way down to 1/4 cup margarine and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  The Thanksgiving guests said it was perfect that way, but no one had a super sweet tooth.  Personally, I will try 1/2 cup margarine and maybe 3/4 cup sugar next time as I felt the reduced version was too healthy and not decadent enough.  :)  Although chunks are good, the potatoes should still be mashed a little bit while you stir them into the sauce.  If you have too big chunks the butter/sugar will not penetrate the center of the chunk.  Did anyone notice that this recipe is very similar to making rice krispie treats-- except you don't add sugar when making rice krispie treats?
***Update*** I've made this every year for Thanksgiving, and it is always a hit.  Definitely go with 1/2 cup salted butter (NOT margarine!) and 3/4 cup brown sugar.

I used 3-17oz. cans of sweet potatoes, reduced the butter to 1C. and reduced the brown sugar to 3/4 C. It couldn't have been easier and the family devoured it.  Will definitely make it again.

These tasted great but the recipe called for WAY too much butter.  I had to drain it all out before I could even eat it.  I will definitely make this again but I will cut the butter in half next time.

I took many of the reviews and adapted this recipe for a recent potluck. My co-workers loved this, even people who never before liked yams were asking for the recipe.  Even though I reduced much of the brown sugar, this was very sweet. Here is  how I modified the recipe. .....

4 pounds of yams,
1/4 cup of butter (salted),
1/2 cup brown sugar,
3 cups of miniature marshmallows, divided,
1/2 tsp vanilla,
1/4 tsp cinnamon,
1/8 tsp nutmeg.

 .....  Many people claim baked potatoes provide the best taste and texture. So, I baked the cleaned yams for 45 minutes in a 350 F degree oven. After removing the yams and letting them cool, I peeled the yams, and mashed them. Then I folded the marshmallow/sugar mixture into the yams. Once mixed, I placed the mix in a baking dish, let them bake for approx 30 minutes at 350F degrees. After 30 minutes, I placed the mini marshmallows on top of the dish and let bake another 5 minutes. Just long enough for the marshmallows to puff and get a touch golden.

Excruciatingly sweet!!!  I reduced the margarine (used butter) and brown sugar to 1 cup each per previous comments, but I think I'll reduce the brown sugar even more to 3/4 cup.  Delicious otherwise.  I didn't mash the potatoes or break them into bite-size bits, nor did I top them with remaining marshmallows because I wanted a true southern-style candied yam dish, not a sweet potato casserole type dish.  This is a keeper!!

I thought this was a great recipe. The only complaint I had was the amount of butter. Next time I'll try to cut it down a bit. They were yummy anyway!

I've been using this recipe for about 3 years now and my family loves it.  I've used fresh and canned sweet potatoes and both work well.  But the secret I've discovered is to fix them the day before and let them sit in the frig for 24 hours before baking.  It makes a big difference, the syrup just goes all the way through the potato. Super yummy!

This is an excellent recipe!  Didn't cut back on anything - I like them sweet and marshmallowy.  I was tempted to add more liquid, but DON'T - the sauce gets thinner as it bakes! I used canned, drained sweet potatoes (6 lb GFS commercial size can 40-50 pieces), doubled the sauce, baked in lazagna pan)  OH SOOOO GOOD!  THANKS Dj!

With a couple of small changes, this is a 5 star recipe.  I sent this with my husband for a Thanksgiving meal at work and everyone raved about it and asked for the recipe!  I did go with 1/2 C butter and 3/4 C brown sugar.  Also, seasoning-wise I used 2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp ginger, and 1/8 tsp ground cloves.  Turned out perfectly!

This recipe was okay.  I cut the butter in half and it was still WAY too much!  Also I decreased the brown sugar and it was still too sweet.  If I make again I will use 1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup brown sugar and 2 cups marshmallows!  Also, we like our potatoes a bit chunky, so I will cube them before boiling and then mix them with the sauce before putting into the oven, instead of mashing them.  The overall flavor was GREAT but they were too oily and sweet to eat very much.  But I'll give it another try with the above changes.

I cut the recipe almost in half using 3 potatoes and peeled them before boiling. While the potatoes are boiling, you can get the pan of butter and sugar started. I used 1/3 brown sugar and 1/3 butter (too much and it will float on top). Added 1/8 cinnamon, 1/8 vanilla and 1/4 nutmeg - nice touch. I used a cup of marshmallows. Don't over mash or it will be a baby food consistency. If you've halfed the recipe it is perfect for an 8x8 size glass pan. I had the oven on 350 for 15 minutes (why 400?)then put on the marshmallows -- only on one side! This way you can pick whether you like a marshmallow topping (I do) or have the side without the marshmallows on top (my husband).  The marshmallows shrink so put on a lot. Oh!  This sweet potato recipe by DJ seems to take the shortest amount of time to make.

I used 5 lbs sweet potatoes (8 cups mashed).  Heated 1/2 C butter (1 stick), 1 C brown sugar and about 20 lg marshmallows.  Mixed together with 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmet, 1 tsp vanilla and placed in a 9x13 pan.  Added a single later of small marshmallows and baked til marshmallows were browned, then added a second layer of marshmallows and browned again.  Turned out beautiful & delicious and no butter floating around.  I think next time I will heat marshmallow creme in with the butter/sugar sauce instead of whole marshmallows.

Amazing and easy!  I used only 1/2 C butter and 3/4 C brown sugar and it turned out perfect.  Made the day before and next day added marshmellows on top and heated up in oven for 20 minutes for Thanksgiving.

I've made the sweet potatoes for Thanksgiving for the last 5 years and I've finally found a recipe that is a keeper!!!! I only gave 4 stars because I felt there was too much sauce. Next year I will either make less sauce or add more sweet potatoes. Also, way more than 3 cups of marshmallows are needed. The 2 cups for the sauce are fine, but way more than 1 cup is needed to top the dish.

This dish is AMAZING!!! I have made this dish over 15 times foe my boyfriend and I. I have become addicted to it. I'll serve it with anything and everything, i just cant say enough! I have also added more marshmallows and if you don't mind the calories I also add more butter. I will continue to make this wonderful dish till I get tiered of it. Thank you to whom ever came up with this recipe.

This recipe was absolutely delicious. Well, almost. I'm a beginner level cook, and wasn't sure whether or not I was supposed to cover after adding the marshmallows. I covered them, which is the only reason I can think of why they would be underdone. I cooked an additional 10 minutes then suggested but they were still crunchy.   With that said, the flavor was incredible. Knowing what I know now, I will cook uncovered and boil for a few additional minutes the next time. Great recipe!

This was a hit at a family holiday, with a few changes. I reduced the butter and brown sugar to 3/4 c. I still found it a little too sweet but people liked it.

Made this for Christmas this year and it was a hit! I made this recipe exactly as is. I would have given it 5 stars except there was WAY too much butter, I literally had to drain it off. Also, my marshmallows never browned, they just melted into everything (I think this is because of the excess butter). Other than that, the taste was wonderful, will make again, just with adjusting the amount of butter!

I've been told many times that these are the best sweet potatoes that people have ever had.  I bake my potatoes and skin them when cool. The key is to have enough nutmeg and cinnamon in them. That is what sets this recipe apart from others. I taste them as I season and keep adding. Absolutely delicious!!

These were amazing! I used canned yams and, based on other reviews, I cut the butter & brown sugar down to 3/4 cup each. I also like a little texture, so I added 3/4 cup of chopped pecans. Delicious!

These were just absolutely amazing!! Definitely the best sweet potatoes I've ever eaten and also the only recipe I'll ever use! This was actually my first time ever making sweet potatoes and honestly neither myself or my husband ever really cared for sweet potatoes to begin with. But these were eaten by ALL!! Sweet potatoes will now become a part of our regular menu! And they were very easy to make also which is always a plus!! :)

used 4 big sweet potatoes. Baked them in 350 oven for 40 minutes, cooled and slipped skins right off. Sauce was so good, yet very sweet after too much. Dish was good, just very rich and sweet.

Use the full amount of butter if you plan on lefovers or the sweet potatoes "dry out" and adding butter later didn't seem to "soak" into the potates.  I only had large marshmallows and measured out 2 cups which I melted all into the mixture for the potatoes.  I didn't top the sweet potatoes later with any more marshmallows since we were cutting down on the sweetness.  I reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup and it was plenty sweet.  Flavor was wonderful!  My husband loved them.

I've made this a few times, it's great if you like sweet potatoes. The toasted marshmallows taste delicious too. You can cut down on the butter some, because there's always some excess butter on the dish afterwards.

Fantastic!!! 

So simple, but so good!  This was a major hit with my family last year.  I have tried many other recipes, but this is the one I will be passing along to my future grandchildren.

Excellent!  I did cut back on the butter and sugar by 50% after reading previous reviews.  I normally do not alter the recipe on the 1st try.  This was a total hit.  It was not to sweet and lots of compliments.  I did add some toasted pecans as a garnish

Sooo delicious!!  I made a few modifications of course.  :) I used about 5 pounds of sweet potatoes and cooked them in the microwave.  I peeled the potatoes and mashed them.  I made the butter/sugar/marshmallow mixture and then mixed it into the mashed potatoes.  Topped it all with some marshmallows and threw it in the oven for about 10 minutes (until browned).  They came out SO good!  This will be my go to recipe for sweet potatoes!!!

I always make sweet potato casserole, and out of pure laziness this year I decided to make this instead. I was so glad that I did!! It's a lot less time consuming, and my family actually liked it better. I guess being lazy can pay off :)

Ohhh my goodness!  This was terrific.  I made this once and found the butter and sugar were a little much.  The second time I made it I followed the advice of another helpful reviewer and  used only 1 stick of butter (1/2 cup) and 3/4  cups of brown sugar and it was awesome.  Everyone raved  and requested I make it for the next get together.  Yummmm!  Thank you for posting this recipe!

I peeled and quartered the potatoes before I boiled them.  I used 1/4 t. cinnamon and 1/8 t. nutmeg.  Whenever I bring this dish to Thanksgiving gatherings, people comment that these are the best sweet potatoes they have ever eaten.  Next time, I am going to add chopped English walnuts or pecans to the sauce.

I am not a fan of sweet potatoes and have never cooked them before, but felt I had to for a traditional Thanksgiving meal.  My grandmother said they were the best she ever tasted!  And I loved them, too.  Great recipe and very delicious.  We like butter in our house, so no complaints there!

I used 6 lbs of potatoes and still would reduce the butter next time to 1 cup. I did reduce the brown sugar to 1 cup as well, and it was plenty sweet.

The BEST candied sweet potatoes I have ever eaten anywhere!  The recipe is straightforward and comes out very attractive too.  My suggested spices are:  1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp ground ginger, and 1/8 tsp nutmeg.

I have always used canned yams, but my sister gave me some fresh ones so I made these. They have to be the best candied yams I have ever tasted. I have made them 3 times and everytime they turn out wonderful. I will never use canned yams again.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit! I have never made candied sweet potatoes with marshmallows in it before but I will never make them without marshmallows ever again! It was so delicious, the cinnamon and nutmeg give them such a great flavor! My husband actually volunteers me to make these to bring to dinner parties! I used butter instead of margarine but other than that I wouldn't change a thing on this recipe.  They are just awesome!!

Super duper delicious! I've had my share of candied yams and sweet potatoes at Thanksgiving, and had never made my own until this year. I chose this recipe because it seemed simple and got amazing review. I'm glad I did because it was out of this world! The only change I'd make is to add more marshmallows at the end so they would only slightly melt. My sister in law and husband adore the marshmallows on top.

I added a little extra cinnamon and nutmeg. I also used 3 yams and 1 sweet potato instead of the 4lb of s.p. the recipe calls for. EVERYONE loved it and it was the talk of the night. There was none left over. Thanks for the great recipe... I will use this one EVERYTIME from now on! It was not too sweet at all!!

YUMMY if you cut most of the ingrdients down 4 lbs potato 1/2 c butter 3/4 cup brown sugar 1 c marshmallows 1t cinnamon 1/2t nutmeg is just right. I put the potato through a ricer and the consistency was perfect.

I have never been a fan of yams or sweet potatoes but my family likes them. Since I found this recipe I am a huge fan. I followed the recommendation someone made and sliced the sweet potatoes in 2 in. sections and then boiled them.....it worked great!! I also used 1C of butter and that was plenty. yum yum!!!!!

Sweet potatoes take FOREVER to get soft.  Boiling for 15 minutes would not have worked.  I boiled the sweet potatoes for an hour and some pieces were still hard (some were mushy too)!  Of course, I had a lot of sweet potato pieces stuffed into one pot, and I’m sure if I spread them out more evenly, they would have had a better consistency.  That’s what I’ll do next time.  I had planned to leave the sweet potatoes in chunks as that was how I had them growing up, but I kind of liked the mushy ones.  My end result was a mixture of mushy and solid pieces (which ironically is what the recipe result was supposed to be) and I think I may eat them like that from now on.  I reduced the brown sugar and butter to ¾ c. each and used fresh sweet potatoes.  What a great recipe!

Make these for Thanksgiving! I made them last year and my aunt called and asked me to bring the sweet potatoes I brought last year. Her family never likes sweet potatoes and they loved these. That's the best compliment anyone can ask for!

This is an excellent recipie.   I also used less butter.  I am sure it would have been great with all the butter, but just trying to cut back.  I was tempted to cut back on the sugar, but I didn't and it was great.  I love "sweet" yams (that is what I used.)  Maybe I will cut back on sugar next time just to try it, but I am sure it will be good either way.

This is the only yam recipe I'll ever make. I've been making this recipe for over 10 years, and everybody in the family loves it. Wherever I take it, I get requests for the recipe. I've shared it with neighbors, and they ask me to make it the next year. It's absolutely perfect.

Very good recipe. I did cook the marshmallow and brown sugar mixture too long and it came out too thick but I added some water to thin it out to the right consistency and it was fine.

This recipe is very easy to make and taste great. I made it for our Christmas Eve dinner and everyone loved it, even my picky dad who has a complaint about everything. I think its a little to sweet, so next time I make it I will probably cut back on the sugar.

This recipe is SO good. I made them for my entire family for Thanksgiving. Every single year for as long as I can remember, they've used the same recipe. I chose to switch it up and use this one. Now they're asking me to make the sweet potatoes from now one because everyone loved them so much. VERY good!

This was the Best!! I have always brought Candied Yams for Thanksgiving out of the River Road Recipes cook book. Never again will I make any other kind. I wasn't sure about the marsh mellows in the melted mixture, so I only added about two handfuls. However, I will add more next time! Can't wait to have these again for Christmas dinner!!!

Delicious! I did bake my sweet potatoes instead of boiling them. I used butter instead of margarine. I also added just a splash of orange juice to the syrup. My hubby loved these. Thanks for the recipe.

I have made this for years but what i do is, take 1 can of yams, and 3 large yams( yams are sweeter than sweet potatoes) put yams in the microwave (saves on peeling and trying to cut them since they are hard) take the yam out of the skins and mix with the canned sweet potatoes then do the following recipe, i reduce the butter, my suggestion is taste as you go, add more if needed that way its not to sweet for those of who said it was. remember taste as you go that is what makes a good cook

I couldn't bring myself to use quite as much butter as the recipe called for, but this recipe was still amazing. I've always felt like candied sweet potatoes are more of an excuse to eat dessert with the rest of your meal, and this recipe exemplifies that idea.

Flat.  The flavor lacked depth.  After taking 2 1/2 hours preparing this recipe I really expected much more.  I cannot understand why so many people rated this so highly.  Maybe their spices were better than mine.  I will not make this recipe again.

I made this for the first time today (Thanksgiving) and I thought it was delicious!! It's fat content is high but for 1 day it won't kill anyone, just think of all the other food and pies eaten today...lol. This was very easy to make.

I made this for a Christmas party of mine and the potatos were a hit ! The only thing I would reccomend is that you put about 1\4 cup butter or slightly more because the recipe calls for 1 1\4 cup butter and I read the other reviews and they mostly all said less butter. I used 1\2 cup and it was still too much. But overall GREAT!

This one appropriately titled - emphasis on 'candied'.  It was delicious but if you're looking for a regular sweet potato casserole, this is not it.  I enjoyed it along with my cornbread stuffing but I had some complaints that it was too sweet.  Also, the chunks were not as well-received as a thoroughly mashed mixture by my family.

I will never make candied sweet potatoes any other way!  Since I used the canned ones to save time (3, 40oz cans, drained) I halved the brown sugar and butter since they are stored in that sweet syrup.  It was perfect!

I can't say enough about how good these are.  I will never used canned again!  I cut the sugar and butter to 3/4 cup each as others recommended and I used 1/2 t of cinnamon and 1/4 t of nutmeg - the flavor was perfect.  15 minutes of boiling was just the right amount of time for my quartered potatoes.

Great recipe.  Made it this past Christmas and it was a hit with the ham.  I used yams instead of sweet potato and cut the butter and sugar to 1 cup.  I might decrease the amount more next time.  Will keep the sam amount of marshmallows, though!

The Best candied sweet recipes I've come across in quite a while.I had to do a little changing because of my Diabetes.Instead of the margarine, I used Smart Balance spread and  for the Brown Sugar, I used half the amount of Splenda Brown Sugar. It came out great and my family loved it.

This is just the recipe I've been looking for. I've tried all the other nontraditional sweet potato recipes and I like them, but I was looking for one with 'sauce' and marshmellows.  I'm making this one now and I almost ate all the sauce before I put it in the oven.  Next time I might add some marshmellows on top and let brown.  yum!!

These were very good, but very sweet!  I followed others' advice, and cut the butter and sugar down to 1 cup each.  It was hit and miss at the table.  Those who liked it, could only eat a little bit.  I loved it.

Really delish dish!  I reduced the butter and sugar as others suggested, and I'm so glad because there was a little circle of melted butter around each serving on our plates!  Watch you don't overbake it, (like I did!) because that makes it feel greasy instead of decadent with butter.  Still so tasty!

This is a great recipe. I've made it for special occasions (Thanksgiving & Christmas) and have got rave reviews. My husband cannot stop eating it. The only issue, is that the potatoes get a litte "runny", so I've added more potatoes.

Let me tell you as a non-cook who hopes to one day be a good cook...This recipe gave me hope! This year I got my first set of real compliments from everyone at Thanksgiving dinner. I used to get them from my Instant Mashed Potatoes or my microwaved corn just because people were in the mood of being polite. This year, I ventured out and found this easy to follow and simple recipe and now I'm starting to get a little respect. :)
THANK YOU SO MUCH DJ! I just made these potatoes again for tomorrow's Christams gathering and can't wait to hear the compliments again from my very honest Indian relatives who never eat sweet potatoes.

This is a GREAT recipe for extremely sweet potatoes. They were a hit but I did decrease the butter by half and used canned yams to save some time. Try this one!!!

Made it for Thanksgiving, and WOW! This was delicious! As I read others had done, I made the following changes: I started with 4.75 pounds of potatoes just because that was what I grabbed at the store. I roasted the sweet potatoes in the oven instead of boiling and I peeled the skin off once out of the oven. I then decreased the butter to 1/2 c (1 stick) and decreased the brown sugar to 3/4c. I mixed all of the ingredients together the night before Thanksgiving and stuck it in the fridge. I popped it in the oven about an hour before we ate since it had been in the fridge all night. I definitely added more marshmallows on top. Wonderful reviews and not much leftover. Great recipe!

I always pierce and then bake the potatoes. This way their natural juices caramelize when they come out of the potatoes. If you boil the sweet potatoes then you boil all the flavor out and you depend on a lot of other stuff for flavor. This recipe is great-but best way is to make sure you taste to your liking using the ingredients given here.

I don't care for sweet potatoes and was terrified when I was asked to make "my mom's" dish last year. There is no recipe and my mom passed away,  so I tried this and everybody said it tasted just as they expected! Nothing was left and I was told I had to bring it again this year!

Very good, used large can sweet potatoes and 2/3 of butter and brown sugar - next time use less butter and sugar

Like other reviewers, I reduced the butter and brown sugar to half. Followed another reviewer by using 1/4 tsp. cinnamon and 1/8 tsp. nutmeg. Made it up the day before minus the marshmallows on top. On Thanksgiving, when the turkey came out, I popped this in with 1/2 C. mini marshmallows on top and baked until they were melty and slightly golden. Everyone loved (!!!) it, including myself!! This recipe is a keeper!!

I have never liked sweet potatoes cooked in this style before...until now!  LOVED this recipe as did everyone who ate them!  Cut the butter and brown sugar back to 1 cup each.

Don't get me wrong...I have a major sweet tooth but these were a little too much for me. I'd cut the butter in half next time and cut back on the sugar too. Otherwise, great flavor!

Substantially reduced sugar (3/4 cup) and butter (1/2 cup), and it was still too sweet for us.  I'll keep trying to find the right balance.

So delicious! I kept the skins on the potatoes. I used only a cup of marshmallows in the mix, and a cup to bake on top. This was entirely sweet enough! I can't imagine if I would've used the full 3 cups! Besides that, the dish was awesome. Thanks for sharing.

These were really yummy! My husband was in charge of the sweet potatoes for our Christmas meal. They turned out really well, the only issue was the marshmallows on top didn't brown but instead just melted back into the sweet potatoes. We could only find mini marshmallows at the Commissary so we think that could have been the issue. Next year, we'll try it with the larger marshmallows if we can find them but the taste was still spectacular!

WOW! The sauce for these potatoes is very simple, but VERY delicious. The only thing I changed was I used real butter instead of margarine and added a 1/2 cup of orange juice. These are some of the best candied sweet potatoes I've tasted.

I tend not to care for sweet potatoes until I made this dish. It was delicious.  Since I was pressed for time, I used 2 large cans of sweet potatoes. This will be on the menu in the future for sure.

This is the best recipe for Candied Sweet Potatoes I've ever tried.  The family enjoyed them so much for Thanksgiving!  Peeled half the potatoes, mashed separately in sauce, then chopped remaining potatoes and folded into mashed mixture.  I did decrease the butter and brown sugar to 3/4 cup ea.  Easy to make - great taste!

This was super sweet but SUPER GOOD!! It was beautiful when the marshmallows plumped up in the oven but when I took it out the marshmallows slowly went down and didn't look the best to present. That's the only thing I didn't like but the taste... AMAZING :)

Fantastic recipe!  It was a tad sweet for me (and I have a sweet tooth), so next time I'll reduce the butter and sugar, and perhaps some of the marshmallows in the sauce.  Was a huge hit at Thanksgiving yesterday; will definitely make it again!!

For some reason I thought each stick of butter was equal to 1/4 C... I "cut back" the butter to 3 sticks (1 1/2 C) and when I put the marshmallows on top and browned them, they slowly started disintegrating. Needless to say, I added more butter than the recipe called for but they were soooo yummy. Everyone loved them too, fortunately. I only added a sprinkle of cinnamon and omitted the nutmeg altogether, afraid of over-spicing, and used the full amount of sugar. In the future I would probably keep the butter at 3/4-1 C, and the sugar to 3/4 C.

These are terrific!  I used a stick of butter (1/2 cup) and 3/4 cup brown sugar, melted with the 2 c marshmallows.  I forgot cinnamon and nutmeg but it didn't need it.  I also used a big can of sweet potatoes (I would use 2 large cans next time) and I didn't melt the other cup of marshmallows on top because it looked so amazing when I opened the oven and given the other ingredients I knew it would be really sweet already.  It was really delicious - best sweet potato recipe I've ever had!

I made this tonight for Thanksgiving!  It turned out delicious!  I ordered a dinner from our grocery store and it didn't come with sweet potatoes.  How could we not have sweet potatoes on Thanksgiving?  So, I made this and my family loved it.

A delicious classic.  On a side note...you can easily do this in a crock pot to save oven space during the holidays.  ;)

This is more like a dessert and is delicious. I halved the butter and sugar. I used half canned sweet potatoes and half baked yellow sweet potatoes. This made it so some was mashed but with nice chucks of the yellow ones. My family loved it.

I made these the past two years in a row for Thanksgiving. Everyone loved them. They are definitely very sweet, but they make a great addition to turkey and mashed potatoes. They are really easy to make and don't require a thousand ingredients, which is nice.

Loved it! Don't always have good turn out with sweet potatoes, but this was easy and SO good! My husband and kids loved it too! 
I followed some of the other suggestions and did half the sugar and half the butter.

This dish went over pretty well with my guests.  I personally do not like candied sweet potatoes, so I wouldn't eat them.  It was easy enough to assemble and looked pretty on the table.

I had always used canned yams but will cook fresh sweet potatoes like this from now on.  This is very, very sweet.  I followed recipe but used whipped butter in place of margarine.  When I make this again I will use less butter,  less brown sugar, less marshmallows, and add a few tablespoons of orange juice to the sauce.  Boiling  the sweet potatoes for l8 minutes makes the peels slide off easier.  Yum!!

Yummy! My husband is like a big kid and loves things super sweet- so he LOVED this dish.  I liked it too, but more as a dessert filling for a pie,etc then as a side.  I would make again b/c it was so easy and very tasty. I used less butter and marshmellows then called for and added a ton of cinnamon, some nutmeg and cloves- that made it delicious : ) Very sweet-but very good. I recommend making - just adjust the butter and sugar to your liking- you really can't mess up this dish, taste as you go and add things as needed. Enjoy!

The spices made this dish awesome! One thing I do, as I hate the mess of peeling cooked yams (& nothing but fresh yams will do), is I peel & cut them before cooking and I actually steam them, takes 20-30 mins, which also works perfect for pies too. Everything else is a piece of cake (pun intended) once u've mastered the yam-cooking step... happy baking all !!!

wonderful sweet potatoes.  The only complaint i have is the potato chunks.  The inside becomes bitter compared to the rest.  I suggest mashing all of the sweet potatoes.  It was fantastic and I will surely have this again.

I never really liked the sweet potato casseroles with marshmellows but this recipe has changed my mind. Made this for Christmas and it was fabulous. The only thing I added was pecans. I'll make it again for sure.

OH MY!  I have had candied sweet potatoes for years.  But nothing like this recipe!  I will never go back to any other recipe again.  This was just excellent!  I made this for thanksgiving this year and everyone devoured it!  I think the main difference with the recipe versus others Ive had is the marshmallow sauce.  It was what made it!  A lot of others just have a runny thin sauce that just runs all over your plate and doesnt coat the sweet potatoes well.  This sauce was nice and thick and coated the potatoes so well that it made it all come together as one!  I went by the recipe exactly except I baked my sweet potatoes and I may have added about a cup more marshmallows!  The more the better!  Thanks for this great recipe!  I will make again and again!  10 stars!

I added 1 tsp of vanilla and left out the marshmellows and used two 40oz cans of Bruce's Yam (really cut down the prep time) There wasn't a piece leftover.  Thank you!

I followed someone else's lead and reduced the butter to 1 cup and the brown sugar to 3/4 cup. My family LOVED it. I was surprised at how much. Even the family members who usually hate sweet potatoes! I will be making it again for Christmas.

I have made this several times now and everyone raves about it. The only thing that I do differently is to bake the sweet potatoes instead of boiling them. I find this method simpler.

Fabulous!  Made them for Easter and my family loved them.  They are very sweet and buttery, but yummy.  I added chopped pecans that I think helped cut the sweetness.  Great make ahead recipe too.

This was by far the best sweet potato recipe I've ever had.  We had tons of cans of sweet potato & wanted to make something with them, so we made this recipe.  Of course I had to make alterations.  I used 2 1/2 lbs. of sweet potato, 3/4 cup brown sugar, freshly ground cinamon & freshly ground nutmeg (I really think this made a big difference), and we topped it with large marshmallows instead of small ones.  It was wonderful!!!

If you use a handmixer to blend the potatoes, this recipe becomes the greatest pie filling. It is so sweet that it is more appropriately served as a dessert. Just pour the mixture into a pie crust and bake at 350 for about 30-40 minutes and place the extra marshmellows on top for the last few minutes until they are melted. Fantastic!

So so good! I did tweak the ingredients just a little. I cut down the amount of brown sugar to 3/4 cup, 3/4 cup of margarine, and only 2 cups of marshmallows. I also used canned yams. This is so great! Not too sweet and very easy! Will be adding this to my recipe box for sure!

Delicious! Very sweet. I halved this recipe and used a large can of yams to save time.

Since, I've become the primary holiday cook in my family, I've been trying and trying to find a sweet potato recipe that will satisfy everyone. I think I've finally found it. :) As others have suggested, I used less butter(instead of margarine) and sugar, and I also added ginger along with the other spices. This recipe is amazingly easy and tastes delicious. It's perfect for large holiday meals because the time and temperature it cooks at don't have to be exact. Thanks!

Very good and easy. I made a few changes. I cut the margarine to half and the sugar to 1 cup and it was still a little sweet.  Next time, I will try 3/4 cup instead.

This is a very good recipe.  I especially liked the cinnamon and nutmeg flavor.  It was just a little bit to sweet so I probably will use less brown sugar next time.

This is one of the most delicious recipes I've ever tasted!  For Thanksgiving each of my sisters and brothers brought something for dinner.  I decided to try this recipe, even though I've never had sweet potatoes before (really!).  Well, EVERYONE loved them, even my father, who can be the most picky person in the world!  My sister commented that they should be a dessert, that's how sweet and delicious they were.  We now have a new recipe to add to our Thanksgiving menu.  Thanks so much for this recipe!  

Try it, you'll love it!

I've made this several times. It's my favorite candied yam recipe ever but I gave it 4 stars because as written it is SO sweet. I cut to 3/4 cup brown sugar and still found it too sweet. Which for me is saying a lot because I've got a serious sweet tooth. Next time I'll use 1/2 cup.

IMPORTANT: I used big marshmallows on top this last time and found that they baked better without retreating into the yams. A must.

I worked on this recipe the day before I served it so I baked the potatoes for an hour and peeled them when they cooled.  I prepared the sauce with 1/2 cup butter and 1 cup brown sugar and added extra cinnamon and nutmeg and blended all together with a mixer and refrigerated overnight. The next day I baked at 350 for 20min and added the marshmallows for an extra 10 or until browned.  It was fabulous!! Everyone loved it, perfectly sweetened and not oily!

I love this recipe!! It's so easy and an absolute  hit with everyone.  I've made it 3 times and now have the changes that work for me.  Here are my adjustments: 1) 140 Oz of canned sweet  potatoes 2) 1 cup  of butter 3) 2 cups of light brown sugar 4) 3 tbsp. vanilla 5) about 1.5 tsp each of cinnamon,  nutmeg and clove 6)about 2 cups of marshmallows. Throw all in pot on stove.  Transfer to 9 x 18 in casserole dish in 400 degee oven for 15 min. Then top with about 2 cups of marshmallows and melt.     That's it!

This has been a hit with my family for a couple of years now. I'm proud to say I'm the official sweet potato person. This year I used yams for thanksgiving and Christmas instead of sweet potatoes. It may have actually tasted better?! But still delicious. I only alter the amounts for when I'm serving about 40 people at thanksgiving. And I completely cover the top with marshmallows so it's usually a bit more than suggested. It's never too sweet so everyone is satisfied.

This recipe was perfect for my 1.75 qt baker! So delightful and tasty for my first time making sweet potatoes. I used about 3/4 c of light brown sugar and 3/4 stick of butter, as mentioned throughout the comments. Thank you so much for the awesome recipe!!

This is the first time I've made candied sweet potatoes and they were a hit. It did take more marshmallows to cover the top and the first layer melted. So I added another layer and broiled till they browned. The melted layer created a crunchy sweet layer that was very tasty. Very easy recipe to follow.

This was delicious. We don't use margarine so we used butter instead. The marshmallow sauce was different and I am sure that raised the delish factor. Added it to my list of favorite recipes.

This recipe is a winner! Used two 40 ounce cans of sweet potatoes (drained) and it was quick and easy. Served it for the family Thanksgiving yesterday and everyone LOVED it! Only half mashed is a wonderful texture for this dish. Had to email the recipe link to everyone by day's end.

As mentioned from reviewers I cut down the sugar and brown sugar one cup each instead of the recommended 1/4 cup more. (Yes its not that much more but I figured its such a small amount that it wouldn't make a difference anyways and I was right!) I also pealed the sweet potatoes boiled them as suggested instead of boiling with the skin on. I had several people ask me for the recipe after the first few bites! My boyfriend hates Yams, but once he tired this recipe he ate two servings! (lots of people told me they didn't like candied sweet potato's but loved this recipe!)

I really liked the flavor and consistency of this sweet potato dish, but it need 2 drastic changes to make it palatable. I used only 1 stick of butter (as opposed to 2.5 sticks) and no sugar at all.  That's right, I completely left out the sugar as the melted marshmallows sweeten the sweet potatoes enough!  Next time, I will add chopped pecans on top:)

I don't cook with sweet potatoes often, so I accidentally peeled them BEFORE boiling them - not sure if that makes a difference in taste, but I'm aware it probably took me a little extra time. I cut the recipe down to 1/3 the original (to serve 4 - there's only two of us to feed!) and it was the perfect amount with some leftovers. I followed everyone's advice and toned the butter down a little bit. I used a ceramic baking dish similar to a LeCreuset for the oven bit. This dish came out super delicious and sweet and yummy! Would make again and keep this recipe in the rotation (with the notes to go easy on the butter!)

This is the best sweet potato dish I've ever made.  I did bake the potatoes instead of boiling them.  Not sure if that affects the taste or not.  I also added a tiny bit of salt.

Everyone loved these! I even messed up and overcooked the marshmallows instead of browning them they ended up melted into the pan. OH WELL they were great!

I have been making these candied sweet potatoes since 1982.  I only use 1/4 cup of butter and only 1 Tbs. Of brown sugar.  I sometimes add crushed pineapple.  The broiler is faster to brown the marshmallows.  My Thanksgiving and Christmas wouldn't be the same without these potatoes:)

I followed another reviewers advice when I chose to use canned yams - it was still delicious, but a bit runnier than I prefer.

OMG! THESE ARE SO GOOD! I accidently added all of the marshmallows to the melted butter mixture. It was so good....My son who never likes the holiday sweet potatoes loved these too. They were a bit sweeter then we're used to, but we loved them.

I thought this was great!

I think the times need to be adjusted though. Prep time was more like 40 mins to get the sweet potatoes softened and ready to cook. After that, everything else seems to be right. 

Also, using previous recommendations I adjusted the brown sugar and marshmallows. I used only half of what it said so thats:

3/4 Cup of margerine (I used butter)
3/4 Cup of brown sugar

Turned out great!

These were fantastic! I did however make a few minor changes that I believe made them even better:

I used less butter and brown sugar, but added a couple of tablespoons of apricot jam. Can you say yum?! Also, after the marshmallows were melted into the butter, brown sugar & jam, I added a small splash of fresh orange juice.

I used bagged sweet potatoes from Trader Joes that were already peeled and cut into chunks--they seemed a little overdone,  so next time I will boil for about half that time.
All in all, this is one for the ages. I will be pulling this out every year for Thanksgiving.

I did something wrong.  I thought this was foolproof after all the reviews but mine was runny.  I was so embarrassed at the party I brought it to.  Nobody tried it.  Someone cut into it and it was all runny.  Oh well, I wasted all of those yams and marshmallows!  Well, whatever I did wrong, it was really bad.  :(

Absolutely wonderful!!! There are only a few of us who enjoy a sweet potato dish so I halved the recipe and lowered the butter and sugar amounts as some of the comments suggested. I also used 1/2 Splenda. Thanks for the great recipe!!!

I made this recipe as is! And I found it to be splendid. As in I absolutely loved everything about this recipe. I originally thought it was a bit much of the brown sugar and the margarine but I just followed the recipe and it turned out perfect. My husband and daughter ate it up!! I enjoyed it enough for two helpings myself! Thanks for the recipe. I love trying great food and anyway, I was looking for this recipe for a while! Turned out perfect! Thanks again!!!

This is FANTASTIC!! I actually made this for Thanksgiving dinner which I was celebrating in Sweden this year. None of the Swedes had ever had Sweet Potatoes so they were a little hesitant but everyone went back for 2nds and the entire dish was gone in minutes!!  I did cut the margarine back to a cup and the brown sugar to 3/4.  This is a new "must have" at all my Thanksgiving dinners!

SOOOO Delicious. This is definitely not the healthiest dish on the menu but it was very good and the guests loved it. I boiled the potatoes and panned it up the night before Thanksgiving and I only had to pop it in the oven for 20-25 minutes. It was really easy but really delicious.

Wow - this recipe called for WAY too much butter and sugar.  It paled in comparison to the candied sweet potato recipe I tried last year, which called for only 1/2 cup of butter.  This was really syrupy and greasy and just overkill with the calories.  I wouldn't make this again.

This is an excellent recipe but I just didn't want to add spices because I didn't want it to taste like my sweet potato pie.  I omitted the cinnamon and nutmeg, added 1/4 teaspoon of salt, removed from heat, added a teaspoon of vanilla and a couple small handfulls of walnuts.  I left all the potatoes in chunks as well, the walnuts were chunky which added a really great texture.

Oh my gosh!!!  Tastes just like pumpkin pie...with a few moderations. I had run out of cinnamon, so I used about 1/2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice to replace the cinnamon and nutmeg. I also took the advice of the other readers and reduced the butter by half and only used 1 cup of brown sugar.  The marshmallow sauce mixed in with the sweet potatoes is what really puts this recipe in a league of its own.  Amazing!!  The kids, who NEVER eat sweet potato casserole, couldn't get enough.  My father-in-law, who is somewhat a food connossoire said it was the best he ever had.

These were delicious. I did cut back on the sugar per other reviewers and will cut back even more next time, they were just a little too sweet for me but other than that, perfect!!

Good flavor but there was way too much liquid in the pan.  When I put the marshmallows on top, they melted into the liquid and we missed out on the crunchy marshmallow top which is my favorite.

This recipe is so delicious. It comes out so buttery! And my family loves rich buttery flavors so that was definately a good thing. I made them on Thanksgiving and they were requested again on new years by my step dad who hates trying anything new. Even he had to admit how yummy these sweet potatoes were.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I too added some crushed pecans and altered the measurements a bit to make slightly healthier by cutting down on the butter and sugar.  The dish came out looking beautiful and tasting wonderful.

I sliced the potatos and then covered them with the butter, marshmallow, and sugar. I used only 1 cup of everything. Still really yummy but much healthier!

This was a really good recipe, but I can only give it 4 stars b/c its missing an ingredient... VANILLA EXTRACT.. I also added a dash of lemon extract... other that that I followed the recipe.  I made it for Thanksgiving & it was a big hit.  This is a keeper!

This was a pretty good recipe. I added a little extra butter and cinnamon and was careful not to overtoast [burn] the marshmallows. Sprinkled pumpkin pie spices lightly on top for flavor and aesthetics. DF devoured this, and he doesn't usually like sweet potatoes. Good recipe!

These were delicious! I did as someone suggested to cut the butter. I used only 1/2 cup butter and cut the sugar by 1/2.  I also made a bit of homemade applesauce (1/2 cup)and put it in the butter, sugar, marshmellow mixture. I chopped the partially cooked patatoes into cubes. I did mash a few pieces in the sauce as I cooked it. I than stirred in the remaining put in dish and bake as directed. I just sprinkled a few marshmellows on top. See photo I sent in.

I have never liked candied yams before this recipe.  I cut and peeled the 4 big yams before I boiled them.  I didn't have the oven space, so I put them in my crockpot.  They were on low for 2 hours. I also added another cup of marshmellows at the very last moment but they still melted.  This recipe certainly changed my view on yams!

These potatoes did come out delicious.
I am a person that doesn't like my food too sweet. I used canned yams which already come sweet. So as a result, I cut the sugar in half. There is sugar in the marshmallows, and this adds additional sweetness to the recipe.

I made these for Thanksgiving dinner and they were absolutely wonderful.
I would always use canned sweet potatoes and i really was not pleased with them at all. For anyone who reads this use fresh sweet potatoes and this recipe and enjoy. Thanks!

I used frozen sweet potatoes and followed the directions on the package to cook them. Then I followed the directions of this recipe to make them candied and took the advice from other reviews to add the marshmallows within the last 5-10 minutes or so and add cinnamon. This was very delicious and I would definitely make this again. Next time I will add a little water to the dish as the sweet potatoes turned out a little dry untily you mash them on your plate.

I just tried this recipe for a Christmas dinner with my soon-to-be in-law family.  It was met with RAVE reviews.  Everyone wanted to take home some left overs--only there weren't any!  Thanks for the great recipe!  I will definitely use this one again!

I made this for the first time Thanksgiving 2002 and I make it atleast once every other month.  It is the BEST I've ever had and the kids love it!  Close to the same thing with the pecans on top but being we dont care for pecans the marshmellow topping is the best.

Sweet potatoes cost quite a bit here, but I was not dissappointed when entrusting precious sweet potatoes to this recipe. My Swedish husband and our Estonian guest loved them, too--even though they were so sweet! This recipe is perfectly delicious!

Very tasty.  I cut butter back to about 1 -1/4 stick.  Next time I would also cut back on the sugar.  I also did not add nutmeg.

YUMMY!  I was not a fan of sweet potatoes before but I was put on "yam duty" for Thanksgiving dinner so I searched for a recipe and found this one.  It was terrific and a big hit at Thanksgiving dinner!  All the left-overs are already gone and I am a new fan of sweet potatoes.  Thanks!!

This is always one of the first sides gone when I bring them to family's for Thanksgiving. I like to add a little pure vanilla extract, a spot of maple syrup, and a splash burbon into the marshmallow sauce. So yummy!

It turned out well and tasted good. What I would do differently is use large marshmellows to cover more surface area on the top of the dish rather than sprinkling small ones. The dish pictured on the website appears to have been made with large marshmellows. Also, I started with 3 1/2 lbs of sweet potatoes. By the time I peeled them, there appeared to be less than I was expecting.  Next time, I would use 4 lbs even though it seems like a lot.

As written, I give it a 3.5 star review. To make it so I liked it better, I cut the butter (not margarine) in half and cut the sugar to 3/4 cup. I also added some orange zest as I felt it needed a little acid. Very good! And now a 4-4.5 star review.

I didn’t have brown sugar so I used about 1/2 as much white. It still was really yummy! Oh I also used 2 cups of butter.

I wanted to try a different sweet potato recipe for our gigantic Thanksgiving get together we had.  This was well-received and liked by many.  I liked the marshmallow, cinnamon, nutmeg sauce and the idea of mashing some of the sweet potatoes was great!  It helped to thicken up the dish.  Very nice and will make again.

I make this recipe every year for Thanksgiving and Christmas. I haven't changed this recipe at all except maybe adding a few more marshmellows on top before baking. My father (a sweet potato snob) LOVES them and says they are the best he has ever tasted and I must agree!

I used canned yams instead of fresh, as I was in a hurry to make the dish. I added pecan pieces to the top and let them toast the first 15 minutes in the oven, then added the marshmallows for another 10 minutes of toasting. Everyone loved it even the younger kids

These sweet potatoes are fantastic. This will be the only way I will cook them in the future. I made them just as the recipe calls with one exception, I put some walnuts in mine. This should be a dessert. Thank you for sharing.

I didn’t have enough sweet potato for the recipe so I had to guess on the other ingredients. I used a bit too much butter but it was still delicious. I think it comes out much better this way , cooking on the stove first before putting in the oven. The flavors are perfect. I’ll use enough sweet potato next time and maybe take a picture.

I boiled the sweet potatoes until fully cooked, then cooled, peeled and mashed.  I melted 3/4 stick of butter with 1/2 c brown sugar and 1 c mini marshmallows.  I added the mashed potatoes, 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg and mixed thoroughly.  Once in the casserole I warmed it in the microwave, then covered the top with mini marshmallows and a few pecan halves.  When the marshmallows melted together I placed them under the broiler to toast.   I wish I'd taken a photo because they were great looking, but they tasted even better!  It's 5 days since Thanksgiving and I'm still getting compliments.  Mine were 5 star

Kinda goofed on it. Bought the sweet potatoes before I found the recipe. After putting it all together, realized it called for four pounds of 'em. Yikes! Didn't have that much. So, came out pretty soupy, but the folks who tried them said it had very good flavor. I'll try again, but pay closer attention this time.

This is THE BEST Candied Yams (Sweet Potatoe) recipe I have ever tried !
I made two changes by using Canned Yams (drained) just to cut down on the Prep time and added about a 1/4 cup of Orange Juice to the glaze mixture just as a little citrus "undertone" too the sweet dish.
NEW FAMILY FAVORITE

Very good! I halved the recipe to use 1 large can of yams, the equivalent of 2 pounds, and ended up having to use 2 cans. The cans worked fine. I didn't have fresh, so I just drained the syrup off.

Steaming the sweet potatoes rather than boiling them also works really well.  I typically use butter instead of margarine.  All my friends are constantly asking me to make this dish!

My mom used to make candied sweet potatoes for all the family holiday meals. When she passed away years ago I decided to start making them but didn’t know her recipe. I found this one and it’s been a hit with the family for close to 10 years now. Easy and delicious!

I've never made sweet potatoes before!  This turned out pretty good except at the end I left the marshmallows on top for too long and they melted a burned a little - whoops!  But I was able to scrape off the burned marshmallow and put another layer on to brown.  But as you can imagine....this made these SUPER SWEET. Still good but way too much sugar for me so I only had a spoonful at dinner!  So be careful when you put the marshmallows on at the final step - they should only take a few minutes or so to brown (once they brown they turn a corner and can burn fast so maybe take them out sooner and they will soften from the heat of the sweet potatoes - better to be safe than sorry)!

I have to start, I don't really like sweet potatoes.  They are okay, but give me a white potato any day and I'll eat it. 
I've made this twice and just tried it for the first time this year and it was good.  I added double the nutmeg and all spice because my hand slipped on the all spice and I wanted to balance the flavors, but everyone seemed to be okay with it so it turned out great.

My family loved this dish... Next time I need to make the full recipe instead of cutting it in half.  Just a side note... when mashing and breaking off chunks make sure to cut the chunks a little bigger than bite size because they shrink in oven :)

I made this as a change of pace from the traditional recipe with marshmallows and maple syrup.  My family LOVED it - it was all gone by the end of the meal, which never happened with the old way of making them.  This will be the new family tradition when it comes to sweet potatoes.

I followed other reviewers' recommendations and used 1/2 c butter and 3/4 cup sugar. This was the BEST sweet potato casserole / side dish I have ever had at Thanksgiving. Not too sweet and the chunks of sweet potatoes gave the dish a better texture than just the mashed canned stuff.

I made my first turkey this year, and it was perfect. 
I rubbed the seasoning  and the champagne on the turkey the day before and let it soak in. 
I cooked the 22pound turkey for about 3.5 hours.

I was looking for a candied yams recipe that was similar to what my mom made for Thanksgiving and Christmas. This was almost the same as the one she made with one exception; after the yams have cooked in the marshmallow sauce,my mom used to add a generous squeeze of half of orange.  I did likewise. Now, it tastes just like my late mom’s candied yams.

Thank you! My daughter and I decided to try a new recipe this year. Instructions are simple to follow we may have cut back a little butter and sugar marshmallows (just our preference) we also couldn't find the nutmeg and added walnuts. I think this recipe has much diversity and would still be GREAT!!! Everyone raved over it during the entire meal.   We will make every year! 
Thanks for the tip on how to cook raw potato, as we usually bake for hours, this was much easier!

Loved this recipe. I cut back on the amount of butter and sugar and it was still good. The marshmallows add sweetness to it. I also added a little French Vanilla extract. Will definitely make again.

This was very good and just what I was looking for.  I reduced the butter and brown sugar to 1 cup each.

I don't really care for sweet potatoes, but I made this at Thanksgiving at a friend's request. I've been sooo wrong all these years. This was great! The only problem I had (minor) was that the marshmallows melted before they could brown. But hey! I can deal with gooey. :)

I opted to leave out the marshmallows. I used organic sweet potatoes and my family loved them! So much better than canned sweet potatoes.

My family really liked them, I read the reviews and tried the baking method over the boiling method. The potatoes didn't quite get done even after the second baking. Next time I will boil them. The favor the wonderful.

If you use canned sweet potatoes, this recipe is going to be way too sweet.  They have added sugar and salt.

Wonderful.  Made with the following changes for a somewhat healthier, yet still tasty result:

1/2 cup salted butter, next I'll try unsalted
3/4 cup brown sugar
At the end- before adding the marshmallows on top- I sprinkled  3-4 handfuls of roughly chopped English walnuts for added texture.

Also: I used the middle sized marshmallows by mistake and the recipe turned out just fine.

I changed up the recipe a bit because looking at the amount of sugar, butter, and marshmallows in the recipe, it was going to be way to sweet for our taste. I used 1/2 cup (1 stick) of butter, 1 cup of brown sugar, the 2 cups of mini marshmallows, and 1/2 tsp of both nutmeg and cinnamon. This made the sweet potatoes just a little sweet, but not overwhelming. With the melted marshmallows on top, it came out perfect! I would make this again. :)

I did follow other reviews and reduced the butter  and  brown sugar. I put it together the night before as someone else suggested, and left the potatoes chunky. It was a big hit for Thanksgiving.  Thanks for all the input,. I always read the reviews and adjust and I never seem to have one that's a flop.

First time making and it was a huge hit! My ratios yielded 18-20 servings. I peeled and boiled 6lbs of potatoes (8 potatoes) cut into quarters. I used 1/2 cup salted butter and 1/4 cup brown sugar. 4 cups of marshmallows for sauce. 1/2 ts nutmeg and 1/2 ts cinnamon. The taste was perfect and afterwards with topping and baking with marshmallows as instructed was perfect. Every bite of this with turkey or ham was delicious. The only thing I'd try differently is not using brown sugar at all just to see what difference it makes in sweetness. After all, it's being mixed then topped with marshmallows so maybe it doesn't need the brown sugar.

Everyone loved this...it received the most compliments I have had on sweet potatoes at Thanksgiving!  I followed the recipe exactly except I used salted butter instead of margarine, and I sprinkled some chopped pecans on top after the first 15 minutes of baking along with a little more than the 1 c. of marshmallows.  The pecans added a little extra crunch and flavor.  And for those who like measurements...I put 1 t. cinnamon and 1/2 t. ground nutmeg which gave it a good flavor.  Feel free to tweak it  from there to your own taste.

I agree it calls for too much butter and brown sugar. First time I made it it was swimming in butter and virtually became an ice cream topping. I think the recipe meant to indicate 1.25 sticks of butter, which is 3/4 cup. In subsequent preparations I now use 3/4 c sugar and butter and I find the balance just right. Still tastes like a dessert!

I changed the servings to 21 which required 7 lbs of sweet potatoes.  I reduced the amount of brown sugar, butter and marshmallows to 2 cups marshmallows, 1 C 3tbs of butter, 1 1/4 C of brown sugar.  I added 1 TBS of cinnamon. 1 tsp of Nutmeg.  The recipe turned out amazing!  Very tasty.  Will make this again for sure!

I made this in a pinch after having a tooth extracted.  I needed something other than soup, yogurt and mash potatoes.  It was perfect!  The only thing I didn't have on hand was the marshmallows and I was fine with that.  It still came out perfect!  Will definitely be making again!

Loved the recipe! Tried it as written the first time I made it but wasn't thrilled with how the yams sweet potatoes came out after boiling so I now cook them in the oven at 350 for about four hours.

LOVE this recipe but WAY too much butter.  I even cut it back to 1 cup and my casserole still was soupy.  Will definitely make again but will cut back on the butter even more.  I used a large can of canned Bruces's Yams and also added the extra spices as other reviewers suggested.  Make a day ahead so your flavors meld, I felt like that made a big difference.  I'm not a sweet potato fan but these are delicious!

This is a very, sweet dish.  I really enjoyed it and used it as my dessert just because of how sweet it was.  If you like gooey and sweet candied yams, this is a great recipe to try. I used 2.5 lbs of canned sweet potatoes and cup the entire recipe by half and used a nice amount of cinnamon.  Will make this again.

I don't know if it was too buttery, I was blinded by the sweetness. I agree with other 'less positive' reviewers. I will try it again, but definitely cutting the sugar down to half a cup. And I will cut down on the butter as well.  I used 1/2 tsp of both cinnamon and nutmeg, and the seasoning seemed good.
What is up with the miniature marshmallows? Mine were stuck together in the package and I had to work with clumps of white sticky goo.
The yield is probably good for a large family, but we only had 6 for dinner and had lots left over, so I may try cutting the rest  of the ingredients in half and reduce the butter and sugar further.

After reading several of the reviews I decided to modify the original recipe. I only used 3/4 cup of butter and 1 cup of brown sugar. I added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla...I didn't understand why it didn't give an exact measurement for the cinnamon and nutmeg....I used 1/2 teaspoon for each of those. I also didn't understand why it suggests to peel after they were boiled, I would have peeled them first if I knew it was going to be equally as hard. 
I added pecans on top to add some texture. I gave it 5 stars because it provided the basic structure I was looking for and it was a quick recipe overall.

I boiled the sweet potatoes and peeled them the day before Thanksgiving (made this really fast to put together). Definitely go with 1/2 cup salted butter (NOT margarine!) and 3/4 cup brown sugar.
PS  Daughter and BF liked it enough to ask for the receipe and she doesn't cook!

I've made sweet potato casserole the past 3 Thanksgivings using different recipes and none were notable. This year, I used this recipe and everyone raved about it. Definitely bookmarked for future reuse! Only change I'll make: I'll reduce the butter as it was too runny.

I made this for thanksgiving and my family devoured it. I did have to substitute some of the brown sugar for sugar in the raw because I ran out but it turned out rather good

I had NEVER made candied sweet potatoes in my life but it was a must since it was my 1st time hosting thansgiving dinner. I tweaked the recipe just a bit. I steamed 8 sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into cubes. I added them to a baking dish. I used 1/4 cup butter cut into cubes and placed over sweet potatoes. I sprinkled 1/2 cup of brown sugar and added cinnamon on top of it. Finally i layered with marshmallows and covered with foil. Spray the foil with cooking spray so nothing sticks!! I put in 400 degree preheated oven and after 15 mins i uncovered it, added more marshmallows and left it in there another 10 mins so marshmallows can toast. It was a HIT!!! i had teenagers over that "hate sweet potatoes" and finished the whole dish. Everyone was asking for more. I will definitely do this again

Made this for Thanksgiving. I read other reviews and only put 1/2 cup of butter and 3/4 cup of the brown sugar and it was PLENTY sweet. Next time I will only use 1/2 cup of the brown sugar, but it was really good. Was my favorite thing at the thanksgiving table this year. And I've never been a fan of sweet potatoes!

My family really liked the taste of this.  I reduced the butter to 1 cup, but after reading the reviews, I'll probably reduce the butter AND brown sugar even more.  The sweet potatoes weren't cooked enough to mash them, so I would increase the boiling time to make sure they're soft enough next time.

I accidentally left out the sugar completely, and it was still sweet and wonderful!   I think the marshmallows make it just sweet enough.  I used 3 lbs sweet potatoes, peeled and cubed.  Cooked them the day before in my lined crock-pot, to make one less dish to  wash, on high for about 3 hours.  Next day, I melted 2.5 T butter with the marshmallows, sprinkle of cinnamon, sprinkle of nutmeg, and mixed the potatoes in.  Baked at 400 for 45 mins (mine were cold due to making cooking the potatoes the day before), then just broiled the marshmallows on top.  Yum and thanks for the recipe.

This was great. I too reduced the butter to 1/2 cup and the brown sugar to 3/4 cup. I forgot to check how much my bag of potatoes weighed, so I held my five pound weight and compared to my bag of potatoes and the potatoes felt lighter. (My guess is that four large potatoes equal about four pounds??) My photo is after we had Thanksgiving dinner, so it had cooled a bit. The hubs and the teenager loved it too, and they are picky eaters!

I really liked this recipe.  I cut the Brown Sugar to 3/4 cup and the butter 1/4 cup.  I am a fan of brown sugar and butter, so. I had never mashed my sweet potatoes before and I love how with half mashed it made the sauce thicker and delicious. Love it and would make it again.

My boyfriend and I were going to an all friends thanksgiving, and I wanted sweet potatoes! My mom used to make candied sweet potatoes every year. This recipe is the best. There were people at the party that didn't like sweet potatoes, but ate SO MUCH of our candied sweet potatoes. Definitely a crowd pleaser. I would recommend adding more marshmallows. The top layer tends to melt and I like having lots of marshmallows!

I have made this recipe for my family Thanksgiving for the past 4/5 years. It is perfect as is! The only modification I make is I may add more spices like you'd find in a Libbys pumpkin pie recipe. I also pile on those mini marshmallows and add extra to the sauce to my liking.

Perfect recipe. If you love soul food you'll love these yams. My family raves over them.

I just can not say enough about this recipe. I HATED this dish all my life - grew up when syrup was doused on these little gems and it grossed me out. This combo of freshness and savory home just converted me. I've made this dozens of times and its a holiday staple forever. I do find that it pays to boil it much longer so it spends less time in the oven. It was always undercooked in the beginning. I also cut it up into thin quarter slices for quicker heating and bite size. Simply fantastic. THANK YOU!

I Made it for our apartment building Thanksgiving dinner and had rave reviews.
This turned out to be an excellent recipe.
 I used five pounds of potatoes and an extra cup of marshmallows to the sugar sauce and it turned out amazing.

Great and easy recipe! I did change the recipe just a bit though since I only needed about half this recipe but the flavor was fantastic. I made this with canned sweet potatoes,  1/2 cup butter, 3/4 cup brown sugar, 2 cups of marshmallows,  added spices to taste, a pinch of salt and about 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract.  I used one cup of marshmallow for the potatoes then the rest to go on top. It was so easy to throw together and the taste, well just try it you'll see!!

Sometimes, you have to cut back on the sugar.  I always taste my sweet potatoes first.  The batch I purchased recently were very sweet and I didn't need to add a lot of sugar.

My family loved this recipe. The next time I make this I will be sure to have more marshmallows on hand. After putting the required amount into the brown sugar mixture, there wasn't enough left to cover the top of the sweet potatoes completely.

Great recipe to draw from. Thanks for the comments, they really helped as well. I used 1/2 cup salted butter with 1 cup of sugar over thanksgiving and my family LOOOVED IT! Now I'm the go-to person for candied yams :-)

Good but way too sweet for my family. They thought it was a dessert! I even did what others said and only added 3/4 c. Brown sugar and 1/2 c. Butter. I will make again but will lessen both the butter and sugar some more.

This was the best sweet potato casserole recipe I have made in many many Thanksgiving dinners!   I made it a week in advance too and froze it uncooked  ( minus the topped marshmallows), took it out the day before to thaw and it was yummy!

Wow! This was awesome! Even though I've never loved the marshmallow sweet potatoes we always had growing up. I doubled but only used 1 c butter and used 1 cup real maple syrup in place of the sugar only put 1 cup of mallows throughout and the rest on top. Also added about 1/4 t pure vanilla. I made it the night before so all the juices really marinated though the sweet potatoes.

I just finished making this recipe! Did not alter any measurements and turned out DELICIOUS!!! :) However I did alter it slightly, I stirred in some crushed pecans before popping it in the oven to give it a little crunch :) Loved it! I am taking it to my mother-in-laws today so will be reheating and adding the top marshmallows there, but I totally sampled.

This recipe is an absolute favourite of mine, one of the first recipes i used on this site. I have been making it every (Canadian) Thanksgiving for 4 years and everyone in my family loves it. Since i am a vegetarian, i use vegan marshmallows and it tastes just as good. This will always and forever be a favourite recipe for years to come.

First time that I ever cooked yams from scratch and the were a hit. Reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup and the butter to 1/2 cup and kept everything else the same. I may not go back to canned again. :)

This is the BEST sweet potato recipe ever!  I had been searching for a sweet potato "keeper" for a few years.  Found this one, made it for Thanksgiving and the family begged for it for Christmas again!  I have a feeling it will be an ongoing request.  Super easy to make.  Thanks so much!

Perfect.  I used the Splenda Brown Sugar Blend, which uses 1/2 the amount of brown sugar.  So I reduced the butter/margarine to 1 Cup like others have done.  This made it easier to use the Splenda equivalent of 1 Cup of brown sugar.  Everything else was exactly as the recipe said and it came out perfect.

My family was in heaven.  There was only one little dish left and my mom immediately claimed it.  She said it was just like the sweet potatoes she has as a young girl.  I cut back on the butter and brown sugar, but I think I'll leave the recipe as is next time.  Thanks!

Made this for Thanksgiving as I lost my original recipe. This one blew my old recipe away. A little too much butter but it didn't ruin it. Every person in my family thought it was great and asked for seconds. Very sweet, almost a dessert category - might want to cut down on sugars and butter, I know I will.

Way too sweet & buttery as written.  Decrease the Brown sugar to 3/4 C (my husband even thought that was too sweet) & butter to 1/2 C.  I used 1/8t nutmeg & 1/4t cinnamon& added 1 t vanilla.   Overall a good recipe w/ changes!

I didn't make enough! I couldn't keep up with the demand at the Thanksgiving table. This was a great fun dish to make. Definitely cut the butter and brown sugar in half. I did, and it was still sweet. You could probably cut back even more than half. I will probably try that next time. Save the calories but still have a deliciously sweet dish!

I used a 30 oz can of sweet potatoes, cut the butter a little, threw in some mini marshmallows & followed the rest of the directions. It seems foolproof. Turned out delicious & loved by all. Easiest Candied Sweet Potatoes ever!!!

Let me first say that I like my sweet potatoes sweet, so I loved this recipe.  Like others, I cut used half the amount of butter and brown sugar and it had plenty of sweetness.  I will make this recipe again.  I put these in the oven with another dish that was at 365 degrees and it worked out just fine.  After I took out the main dish, I brought the temp back down and popped the potatoes back in the oven after covering with marshmallows.

I don't know where the "candied" part comes in because these were more like sweet potatoes in brown sugar sryup.  They were not candied at all.  I will try baking the raw potatoes in the brown sugar mix and see if they will thicken up.

looks good! Wont be trying it until tomorrow, but I've already poured most of a cup of butter off the top. 
Update: Everyone loved it. It is bloody awful for you, but really good. I stirred the mashed sweet potatoes into the marshmallow sauce for about half an hour until it was smooth and condensed down, than poured it over 1 inch slices of boiled sweet potato in a 9x11 glass pan. baked as recommended. The marshmellows on the top mostly just dissipated into the sauce.

Great Starting point for a Candied Sweet Potatoes Recipe. Simply Yummy. Entire family loved this. I made this in anticipation of getting Thanksgiving Dinner Menu together, wanted a variation to the normal that I do. I found it. I only gave it 4 stars because I added toasted nuts to it as a splash of vanilla.  For best results (Ive made it twice now) make sure the sauce is completely melted and blended together... But YES this is a GREAT YUMMY Recipe. I will make this ALOT more.

These sweet potatoes are very sweet indeed! Great for a desert or a sweet side dish! I used less butter, replacing the margarine with unsalted butter, and it came out just fine. I made these for my boyfriend and he really loved them, so did I. I plan on making these potatoes again as a desert since they were so sweet.

This was very easy and very good.  I read most of the reviews and based on the suggestions, I cut the brown sugar to 3/4 cup.  The next time I make this, I will use the full amount in the recipe rather than cut in half.  I recommend this!

By following the changes made by other reviewers, these were easily the best sweet potatoes I have ever had! Much better than the ones in my school cafeteria... These are the changes that I made: 1 cup of butter instead of 1 1/4 and 3/4 cups of brown sugar instead of 1 1/4. Also, because I didn't have each individual spice that the recipe called for, I used some pumpkin pie spice. (I just eyeballed the amount.) Great recipe!

Made this for Thanksgiving. I shied away from making sweet potatoes because I could never get them sweet enough for my taste. THIS RECIPE is it. I followed it to the "t" it was GREAT!!! Saved to my favorites. It will be made again. THANKS.

This is a wonderful dish that was a HUGE success with my very diverse and picky family. I made two alterations:  (1) because I'm not a big marshmallow fan I replaced the marshmallows on top with pecans, which provided a nice crunchy texture and cut down on the overall sweetness of the dish (2) just prior to making this dish I realized I didn't have enough fresh sweet potatoes so I used a combination of fresh and canned so I used a can of sweet potatoes (that I broke apart with a fork) to thicken the sauce and then stirred in larger chunks of the fresh sweet potatoes. No one could tell the difference and it was a great way to use up the canned sweet potatoes! I will definitely make this dish again!

Excellent, simple recipe. Followed the recipe as listed and topped the dish with chopped pecans before layering with marshmallows.

Best sweet potatoes ever! Everyone single kid and adult liked them....even one who has hated them for 40 years! Used 1/2 c butter, 3/4 c. brown sugar and maybe 3 lb of potatoes.  Perfect.

I love this recipe.  It is so delicious.  I made it for Thanksgiving 2012 and my family devoured the dish.  This was the one dish that there were no leftovers when I started packing up the food that night.  Thank you DJ for this recipe.  It really is the best.

Wonderful!  Put half the margarine and that was still too much.  But everyone loved it!  Glad I tried to make it.  First time I have ever made sweet potatoes (my mom usually makes them).  I peeled them though.  The recipe did not say to do this but it worked out great.

I'm not a fan of sweet potatoes, but my husband loves them.  He gave this a 4 only b/c the marshmallows on top were too much.  I made it without the marshmallows on top and he loved it!

Absolutely delicious! I read the reviews prior to Thanksgiving dinner; took the advice of many and cut down the amounts of butter and brown sugar a little bit. It didn't detract from the recipe at all. I used a round casserole dish because my 9x13 pans were occupied. Still came out great, but next time I'll be sure to use the right pan size to have more surface area to cover with marshmallows! We'll definitely make this one again.

Absolutely the best sweet potatoes ever! These beat Boston Market by far! My husband could wait for his buddies to try it. Unfortunately there were not many left overs after Thanksgiving dinner. The only thing I would add it a little more marshmallows on the top - instead of 1 cup - I would add 2 cups next time. So sweet and tasty!

This Thanksgiving was my first time ever making sweet potatoes and my children's first time ever having them.  They absolutely loved them and went back for seconds and thirds.  Great recipe! I am definately keeping this one out for Christmas.

My husband ate himself silly!  I don't think the marshmallow topping adds anything to it.  I think it's so beautiful without it.  It's rich and bubbly and looks as good as it tastes.

Thanksgiving eaters loved these! I didnt have any nutmeg though, and i bought one too many yams, so i had a seperate mini-batch too, which instead of putting marshmallows on, I decided to put some nuts over. I thought pecans, but then since i had none i used the ice cream sundae topper chopped nuts! It went over very well for those who dont like too many marshmallows. Very sweet recipe! Thanks for sharing!

This is fantastic as is. but if youre worried about the butter amount use a lb more yams or sweet potatoes. thats what i did. after baking as the recipe said i dint put the topping on. i let it set over night(i made it the night before) then topped with glazed pecans a little bit more brown sugar and large marshmallows.baked at 350 for 10 min or til brown.   OMG my boyfriends 70 yr old gramma told me it was the best sweet potatoes shes ever eaten! and shes SOUTHERN!!!

I had to make sweet potatoes for a thanksgiving dinner i was in charge of. I have never made them before so i searched for two days for a good and easy recipe. I know i read alot about the butter problem. If you are like me and love the taste of butter ( i use i cant believe its not butter) i tried this recipe two times and found that if you make it the night before you want to eat it put it in the fridge and reheat the next day. You still get the great butter taste with out all the floating butter.

Delicious!  Everyone in my family loved it!  I don't understand why other reviews thought it was too sweet.  It was perfect for me.  Maybe because I used light brown sugar?  The only problem I had with this was there was too much liquid in it.  Next time, I will try to cut down on the butter and see how that helps.

This was very good, but a bit too sweet.  (And I really like sweet!)  I will definitely make again, but will add less sugar.

Sooo yummy!! I boiled my sweet potatoes for about 30 minutes, until they were tender. I also used mini-marshmellows in the sauce and big marshmellows on top of the potatoes. The big marshmellows got nice and brown and melty. It was a hit with everyone, even the picky eaters who swore they hated sweet potatoes.

Awesome!  The only thing I changed was I only used 1 cup margarine and I also topped it with a mix of sugar and cinnamon. (and then added the marshmallows on the top during the last couple minutes of cooking.)

My daughter begged me for sweet potatoes so I tried this recipe.  I took the advice of others and halved the butter.  I'm not a big sweet potato fan, but this recipe is really really good.

These were really good but really sweet! I used butter instead of margarine and didnt top with marshmallows. I think I will follow other reviewers and cut back on the butter next time. Other then that they are very very good!

I do not eat sweet potatoes so I had no clue what I should look for in a recipe. This one had such great reviews that I decided to make it and it was a huge success. The biggest fan of sweet potatoes in the family who has been making them for years asked for this recipe which made me feel great. Every holiday this will be the recipe I serve no doubt.

My family didn't like sweet potatoes for T-day or any other day - until I made this.  Try it, you won't be disappointed.  I added a few more marshmallows, but only about 20% more.  Enjoy.

Hubby loves these.  I don't care for sweet potatoes, but he insists on them anytime we have a holiday meal.  The only change I made was to use butter instead of margarine.  I can't speak for them myself, but judging from his reaction to them everytime I make them, they are definitely 5 stars!

Very good and sweet, really more like candy than a vegetable.  Reduce the butter by at least 1/4 c. though.  I ended up with a layer of melted butter at the top of the casserole

Made these for Thanksgiving dinner for European guests who have never had sweet potatoes prepared in this way.  Was a bit sweet (and strange) to their taste. A bit too sweet for my taste as well.  Good recipe, but will cut back on brown sugar next time.

I made these for Christmas dinner.  I took the advice of halving the butter and brown sugar.  They were wonderful.  I had two people tell me they were the best sweet potatoes they have ever eaten.  I AGREE!!!  Easy, too.  This will be my permanent sweet potate recipe.  Thanks DJ.

These were very good -- this will be my permanent sweet potato recipe, with a few changes. I used 3/4 cup of butter and even that seems like too much. They were also very, very sweet, so I may cut down on the brown sugar. I also added a touch of vanilla extract, and sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top of the marshmellows when it was finished cooking. Very pretty.

This recipe was super easy and everyone loved them. I cooked six pounds of sweet potatoes and left the rest of the ingredients the same. This recipe will replace my old one.

I just made these for Thanksgiving dinner tomorrow.  I was intending to put them in the fridge, so I can just take them out and warm them up.  But, my three year old and I just keep eating them!  They're are so yummy and addictive.  I might have to make another batch.  Great recipie.

This was the great classic recipe.  I didn't use the exact measurements and it still tasted yummy.

Wonderfully easy recipe.  I used it for my first time making candied sweet potatoes and they were a huge hit.  I added a 1/2 cup of rehydrated mixed raisins before baking and they gave it a great texture.  Excellent, fail proof recipe.  I especially like the fact that the potatoes are measured by weight, not in number of potatoes, since they can vary greatly in size.

I cooked my first Thanksgiving dinner yesterday and served this to my family.  My dad, who prior to yesterday made the best sweet potatoes around, said that this was without a doubt the best recipe he'd ever eaten.  And it only took a few minutes to make.

Thank you so much for this great recipe!!  It's one I'll be passing down to my kids.  Goodbye King Syrup!!

These were good, but I did not like them near as well as the "Gourmet Sweet Potato Classic" recipe on this site.  I guess I like the traditional casserole style sweet potato dishes rather than the candied.  I used 1-1/2 sticks of butter since I thought the 1-1/4 cups was a little too much and baked about 6 medium potatoes rather than boiling them.  I used my hand mixer to blend everything together since I'm not too crazy about lumps.  The consistency and texture was good, but the taste was only so-so.  Thanks for sharing Dj.
