This is a very easy dessert to make. I made it as the recipe calls the first time--very good. The second time I tried the white chocolate pudding instead of vanilla--even better. Next time I will also use 1/4 cup less milk to make it hold up better. I also used mini chocolate chips instead of the regular. I like the appearance better and it disperses the chocolate flavor throughout the whole pie better. Will make again.

Okay, so I have to admit I radically altered this recipe, but it came out GREAT!!!  I used 1 1/8 c of milk, I replaced the mocha mix with Ghiardelli  chocolate hazelnut hot chocolate mix, and I added 1/8 c of Starbucks coffee liqueur.  The pie was devoured in ten minutes.

I used chocolate pudding, almost doubled the amount of cappuchino mix and from what other posters have mentioned, I only used 1 1/4 cups of the milk.  Totally delish.  Will make this again for sure!

Thank you LV.  This was unbelievably rich and so easy to make.  It took me 5 minutes to prepare.  I followed some of the other reviews and used mini chips and white chocolate pudding, only I used two boxes instead of one.  I also substituted with instant white chocolate caramel cappucino mix and pecans.  Next time I will drizzle caramel over the top. This one's for you, Sis.

This recipe was very, very easy. I used all of the milk and it was perfect. I used white chocolate pudding mix as well as a few Tbsp. of chocolate pudding mix to make it darker. I also used 3+ Tb. of Mocha powder to make the flavor stronger.  I had the chocolate chips and nuts, but in the end I used half a bag of milk chocolate toffee pieces instead because I thought the flavors went better together. It got rave reviews, and everyone wanted to know how to make it.

This tastes great, I used less milk as suggested, but was dissapointed that it didn't help it set up better it was a little like soup.

This scrumptious pie recipe was the easiest thing that I have made for ages!  I made it late the night before a big office potluck and I got SO many compliments on it that it was almost embarassing!  I DID, however, take the advice from some of the other reviewers (thank you!); I used mini chips instead of regular, white chocolate pudding instead of vanilla, and I reduced the amount of milk in the mixture to make sure it set up.  I used fat free whipped topping and skim milk (still yummy!) and also decided to dish it in a chocolate pie crust instead.

This recipe was good and very easy.  I didn't think it was anything special.  It just tasted like pudding with an oreo crust - I didn't think the cappuccino flavoring came across very strong.  I served it for a dinner party though and one woman said it was the best pie she's ever had.

Changed to white chocolate pudding.  Changed the milk to 1 1/4 c.  Changed the hazelnuts to Heath bar chips.  Got rave reviews from my adult grandchildren.  Too sweet for me and my friend but her mother loved it also.  It will be one of the pies in my rotation for our bake sales at church though.  Thanks for the recipe LV.

This was easy to make and very good.  I think I would like to try it sometime with the mocha layer on top of a dark chocolate black-bottom style filling.  I made one with the hazelnuts and one without - the nuts totally made the pie.

I would give this a 3, but my husband loved it so I gave it a 4.  I really wanted to have more cappuccino flavor, but he loved because it didn't taste like cappuccino.  I mixed some coffee flavoring into some chocolate syrup and drizzled it on top.  I will probably make it again though because we love chocolate.

Good pie, but didn't turn out sweet enough.  We had to use the sugar free pudding since one of our family members is a diabetic.  Not sure if that was a mistake but would like to try this again using the real pudding mix.  Thanks for sharing.

Very easy and delicious.  I think I will use a little less milk too, b/c mine didn't hold up as well but it was still great.

Yup, this was a yummy recipe.  I did the same as the others and used the white choco pudding and less milk.  Everyone love it!  Thanks.

Despite reducing the milk and allowing to set up overnight it was still too goopy to look nice enough for company.  The taste was fine but  it was hard to serve and didn't look good on the plate.  I wanted something to take in to work for "Pi" day on 3/14 but this won't work.
