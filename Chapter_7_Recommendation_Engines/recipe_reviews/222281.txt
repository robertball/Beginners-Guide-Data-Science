This is a great recipe! The only thing I did different was pre-season the chicken tenders heavily front and back with onion powder, salt (light), little pepper (lightly), and garlic powder...with exception to salt and pepper. I probably went heavier on parm cheese and bread crumbs...that is just what I like. I do this no matter what the recipe calls for, because it always gives that added flavor boost and keeps it from being bland. Thank you Crystal for sharing this recipe, it is different from most breaded chicken recipes, delicious, and easy to make!!

All the flavor of those wonderful spices and seasoning were lost!  Maybe it would help to skip the flour and just apply the spices and seasonings directly to the chicken, dip in buttermilk, and then in the seasoned crumbs/cheese mixture.  Has potential, but needs tweaking.

This was delicious!  I made it with boneless thighs instead of breasts.  I cooked it in a frying pan in the oven instead of a rack, and the bottom was very brown and crispy; delicious!!  The first time I added the optional salt, but it was too salty, so second time no salt, and it was great.  I had a lot of the buttermilk left over, so next time I will try just a half a cup instead of whole cup.  Adding this to my menu rotation!
