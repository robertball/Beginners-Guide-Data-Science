This was a beautiful blend of flavors. I was going to add a little lemon juice, as suggested by other reviewers, but once I tasted the original sauce as written, I was already hooked.  This made a boatload of sauce and I spooned the extra over baked potatoes, then sprinkled with bacon bits.  We liked it on the potatoes even more than on the salmon.... seriously, this stuff would make treebark taste fantastic! Awesome recipe!

All I could taste in this was the soy sauce making it way too salty. Even though I used a grainy, strong Dijon mustard I couldn't taste any of it or any ketchup.   Next time I will halve the soy sauce and at least double the mustard and ketchup  as well as increase the Worchestershire sauce.   Hopefully this will prevent it from ruining very good salmon.

I tasted this sauce after making exactly as stated and I too added some Sriracha sauce and a small squeeze of lemon.

This was good but a little salty. I also cooked it too far ahead so I turned it off thinking it would stay warm but it got cold and the ingredients separated. I will make this again because we enjoyed the flavor. It goes good with the salmon.

I halfed this recipe and added a little bit of brown sugar to combat the saltiness and it helped a lot. 
I had trouble with the ingredients separating but maybe I didn't simmer it long enough.

Wasn't buttery and didn't look anything like the picture. All that soy sauce made it way to salty.

MMMmmm.  Nice complement to the strong salmon flavor. Also doubles as a salad dressing with the warm salmon on top of crisp greens.

I usually do not add or take away from a recipe so I made this twice - once following  the directions and second by changing some ingredients. The recipe submitted was perfect and tasted delicious, hats off to the chef! The second time I made this I substituted unsalted butter and used half the soy sauce it turned out OK. I preferred the recipe submitted. So once again - hats off to the chef for this delish sauce.

This is a pretty great sauce. I couldn't imagine it being good, but most of the reviews were raving about it. 
I did notice that everyone who added brown sugar said their sauce separated, so I did NOT go with that modification.
I had most of the ingredients, I subbed dusseldorf for the dijon and I used spreadable light butter w/canola oil rather than a stick. 
At the end I thought it could use a little sweet, so I added a small amount of Maple syrup. 
I didn't measure anything, I just eyeballed it, so I'm not sure it will be the same next time. 
I'm sure if you just use this as a base, you can keep adding  things until it works for you!

I read other reviews where people complain that the sauce separated...well, if you add any sort of sugar, that’s to be expected. DON’T add sugar/brown sugar...it will ruin the sauce! Yes, it’s definitely salty, and a little goes a long way, so I recommend that you cut the recipe in half the first time you try it; that way, if you decide it’s not to your taste, you won’t have wasted half a pound of butter. Be sure you taste it before slathering it on your salmon...we used it more like a side dip, so we could control how much was included in each bite. I also mixed a small amount of this sauce into our steamed broccoli, and it was very tasty, though still salty.

This sauce was delicious. Like others suggested, I added about 3/4 Tbsp of lemon juice. The second time I made it I also added 1/2 of the soy sauce as it was a little too salty for me the first time. I also used a whisk to stir the mixture the entire time as this further prevented the sauce from separating the second time I made it.

Super easy to make! Wanted a change to the basic salmon dish and I had all of these ingredients minus the fresh garlic on hand, so I subbed for some garlic powder. Obviously prefer fresh, but it still came great! Easy - breezy and husband approved!

Had high hopes but this did not deliver. Weird flavor combinations for my taste. We prefer the Asian glaze I usually make for salmon.

It's delicious on salmon and equally fine on roasted green beans! I added lemon as recommended and used Smart Balance light in place of butter, along with reduced sodium soy sauce. A huge hit!

I am so sad that this highly rated sauce failed for me.  I followed the directions....added a little lemon juice and brown sugar, as suggested (after I tasted it)...but then....boom, it separated.  I even whirled it in a mini food processor to see if I could get it combined...but no.  Sad face.

We live on the Puget Sound and every other year the pinks run, so we catch on the beach and BBQ them right there! Although, the  color is not that appealing, everyone (including the fishermen) ask me to send them the link to this sauce. It's amazing and we always add lemon, honey and grated ginger. Thanks for the recipe!

I love this! Mine didn't turn out as dark as the picture, but I didn't cook mine for as long. Still very good

As written this was way too salty and I used low sodium soy sauce! I added some more butter and lemon and it was better. Next time I make it I will use half the  low sodium soy sauce. I could see it being a yummy 4 with these alterations!

Thanks for sharing.  I have made this a few times.  I have even halved the butter and replaced with oil and water :)   Delicious anyway on salmon, mahi mahi, sea bass...
