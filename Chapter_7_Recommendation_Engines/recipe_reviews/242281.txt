It was very good. The shock on the faces of my  Italian relatives  was worth the effort cooking. They all loved it.  Some history:  We hosted a Family gathering, wife's side.  They are all  of Italian decent. Me being Scotchirish, I followed the recipe here. It worked. The food was real good and  the sausage was tender, not chewy. Thank you for the recipe, you have a winner.

I sauteed the peppers and onion for about 10 minutes.  Then added the baked sausage and tomato sauce.  I then simmered that for about 30 minutes.  I also added a clove of minced garlic, oregano, salt and pepper to taste.  I would recommend less tomato sauce as it kind of overtakes the dish.  Next time I will try one 14.5 oz. can.  Served it with fresh bolillo rolls.  Final verdict is this is a really good meal and perfect for chilly fall evenings.  I liked it!

I make this but don't cut the sausages and use Contadina pizza sauce for a little more zip.  A family favorite for 4 generations.

I made this with hot sausages lots of onions and peppers. To give a little kick to the sauce I threw in a few whole jalapenos. Excellent flavor.

This recipe needs spices, added garlic, basil,  oregano. Cooked the sausage in a pressure cooker which drew out all the fat and left the meat fork tender then added the peppers to the sausage.

04-02-16 ~ Loved the ease of this recipe. I had four spicy homemade sausage to use and they were wonderful with this recipe. I kept them whole, as I wanted them for a sandwich, but used all the other ingredients listed as stated. We really enjoyed our meal and I will be using this recipe again.

Delicious! I found cutting the sausages while they were a bit frozen made the process super easy. I only had 5 sausages, and I used 1 green pepper and 1 can of sauce...that was perfect for us. The whole family loved this! I will def be making this simple recipe again and again~YUM!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)
