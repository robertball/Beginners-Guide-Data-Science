I like to follow the recipe as is the first time, then maybe play around with it later.  This one is a keeper.   If I never did anything else to it, we would enjoy it every time.

We loved this. The combination of flavors was perfect. Seconds were had by all and we will gladly be eating the leftovers this week.  My changes were adding 3 cloves of minced garlic along with the sautéed veggies, 3 extra cups of chicken broth because there wasn't enough liquid for my potatoes, using fresh instead of dried thyme, and omitting the cayenne. I will definitely make again and probably use milk instead of half and half as I don't think the great taste would be compromised and maybe add some shallots as well. Thanks for a great new soup recipe!

10.2.16  Starting to think of Fall (I can dream, even though it’s still in the 90’s in Florida) and even more of soup.  This is a very nice potato soup, but I would recommend if you’re “spice-sensitive,” start with a little less cayenne, and then add more to suit your taste.  We’re about middle-of-the-road on spiciness, and this just was just a tad too much cayenne for us (personal taste).  I used fat-free half-and-half to lighten the soup, and didn’t feel there was any sacrifice in flavor, otherwise, followed the recipe to the letter.  The texture slightly  thickened (perfectly), there was just a tiny bit of a crunch from the carrots and the celery (just the way we like it), and I did set aside some of the bacon for a garnish.  The recipe indicates preparation time is 1 hour and 20 minutes, but this will be on the table in about 35-40 minutes.  Marilee Wilson Mack, thanks for a really tasty new soup!

Delicious!!  couple of changes--added more stock than the recipe  called for.  I found it rather "thick".  It was plenty thick enough with the added stock.   I also eliminated the bacon only because my husband does care for bacon!  I'll make this again.

It's not often that I stick to the recipe as written. In this case, I substituted one of the Russet potatoes for a sweet potato. I only peeled about half of each potato. That way it gave the soup the added bonus of bits of potato skins. The potatoes we had might have been rather large, because it was turning out to be too thick (IMO). I added another 1/2 cup of chicken broth and 1/2 cup of half and half to thin it out. Even with the extra cup of liquid it was still thicker than most potato soups. Since we were eating the soup immediately after cooking, I wanted the flavors to blend faster, so for about half of the amount of thyme the recipe called for I used ground rather than dried flakes.

Other than that, I probably used around 20% less salt than the recipe called for and unfortunately I didn't have any green onion.

The end result was very tasty. My wife liked it and said that it reminded her of chicken pot pie. Ah HA! At least with how I made it, that is basically what it tastes like. Except for being without chicken meat, it tastes a lot like the chicken pot pies from KFC. The next time I make it I'm thinking that I should search for a flaky crust recipe and use this (modified) recipe to make vegetarian pot pies.

It was delicious.  Substituted milk for half and half, shallots for onions and added a clove of garlic.  Changes were thanks to another review for this recipe.  Thanks.

We enjoyed it, I added some sour cream to it and used dill in it. Had a nice flavor to it.

Absolute Yum! I usually like cheesy potato soups, but I had a friend coming over who can’t have cheese. So glad I tried this! One of our new favorites! (FYI I didn’t add the cayenne pepper or nutmeg)
