The photo of this dish is the one I submitted.  It was a hit at our neighborhood adult Halloween party.  I added bloodshot eyes by dipping a knife in paprika and lightly touching the eyes.  I found the recipe to be a little too dry and added a couple more tablespoons of mayo.  I also colored the mayo yellow for the spot in the middle of the eye.

These are really adorable and fairly easy to make.  Only suggestion is, to use BLUE food coloring, and not green.  We put in 10+ drops of green and it didn't change color.  My daughter said, "yellow eggs and blue food coloring will do the trick", and sure enough, it did!  :)

Great presentation on the party table.  Did not use relish and used Miracle Whip instead of mayo plus some additional spices.  Use black olives and green olives with red pimento.  Tucked the small green olives inside the black olives - nice and spooky!

These were very good and a very cute concept for Halloween! Everyone loved them and they are so very easy. I used a toothpick dipped in liquid red food coloring to make the "veins" for the eyes. I also put some egg mix aside not tinted green to make the pupil. Thanks for sharing this cute idea :)

Was really yummy, but we couldn't figure out how to get the blood shots and the paprika didn't look nearly as good as in the pic so we ended up mixing mayo and red food coloring and it looked great.

Just a few tips for deviled eggs in general -- If you want the yolk of the egg to be positioned exactly in the center of the egg, turn all of your eggs you will be using on their side in their carton the night before in the refrigerator.  This will center the yolk and when you boil them the yolk will stay there!  If you want the yolk to retain it's natural yellow color instead of getting that icky green rim (although that wouldn't really apply for this recipe), have a bowl of ice cold water filled with more ice ready after you get done cooking the eggs and immediately transfer them to the cold water.  The green rim occurs from a chemical reaction that happens when the yolk is exposed to oxygen.  Rapidly cooling them in the water will stop the reaction from happening, yay! :)

My 12 year old daughter found this recipe and made these last night. We had to add about 4 times as much mayo as the recipe called for as it was very very dry following the directions. To make the "eyeballs" appear bloodshot, we lightly sprinkled the filled eggs with paprika before adding the olive slices. So far everyone has thought they were fabulous.

Fun and easy...  The color's a bit off, I used ~6 drops of green food coloring.  To get blood-shot eyes, dip a sharp knife tip into red food coloring.  Lightly slit the egg white in little jagged lines.  If you hold the slit slightly open, the food dye will seep in and give a more authentic, fine color.  Thanks Angela!

I loved this idea, and it was easy which is a plus for me! I have my own deviled egg recipe so I made it and just added green food coloring. I put the mix in a baggie and squeezed it into the eggs (I usually just use a spoon). I used a toothpick and red food coloring for the lines, and I didn't put mayo in the black olive because I didn't like the way it tasted.

I give this a 5 for the idea but only a 3 for the recipe.  The idea is adorable, but the recipe looks like it would be dry.  I used about half a cup of mayonnaise and about a tablespoon of Dijon mustard, plus a bit of salt.  Just kind of keep adding mayo and mustard until it seems right.  Or you could just use your regular deviled egg recipe.  Also, to get the filling back into the eggs looking nice, just scoop it into a Ziploc bag, snip off corner, and pipe the filling back into the eggs.  It looks very neat that way.  My eyes were a big hit and I'll make them every year :)

Made these for my daughter and her friend. Skipped the relish.  Use a toothpick and red food dye for the bloodshot look.  A big hit!

Loved how these came out.  Guests gobbled them up at my Halloween party.  I used a corn cob holder to draw blood veins by dropping red food color in small dish and dipping the sharpe ends of the corn holder into the dye and scraping the lines on the white of the eye.  Comes out well.

I thought these were so cute, loved them, so did everyone else. Should of used gel food coloring, would have gotten a better red. I used red colored mayo for my veina and pupils. Thanks for a great idea.

For a Halloween eye pleaser, this was great! It added a well liked party food to the table and also gave it some spooky artistic flair! We used fresh chopped dill pickles and no mustard for our own tastes. I coupled this dish with some lady finger cookies and a cauliflower brain holding guacamole mixed with black beans. All of my guests had fun seeing my regular party food mixed with something a little more gruesome! Thanks for sharing!

Per suggestion of others, I also used blue food coloring instead of green.  I did mix mayonnaise and red food coloring for the creepy veins that worked great. I held out a little of the yellow egg mixture for a little dot inside the olive, spicy mustard would work as well.  These are very fun to make.  I am sure they will go over well tonight for our Halloween party.  I made an "Eyes of Newt" place card, to add a festive flair.

What a great idea.  I came across this recipe after the holidays.  Next Christmas, I'm going to make red and green centered deviled eggs!  Halloween, maybe orange.  Can do this coloring thing for all the holidays!

Great idea!  I used dill pickle relish instead.  I put all of my egg mixture in a zip loc bag and cut the very tip of a corner of the zip loc off to squeeze into the eggs.  It came out looking like green worms!  So instead of eyeballs, my eggs looked like little cups of green worms.  It was super easy!  I didn't use the olives or the red food coloring, which saved me time too.

Totally, totally adorable!  I did modify the recipe a little, but not a lot. I added some horseradish because I like my deviled eggs with a little kick.  These definitely needed some "bloodshot" though, so I did the toothpick dipped in red food coloring.

These were a huge hit at my Friday the 13th party! I forgot to add the celery salt, but they were delicious anyway.  The only change I made was to use brown dijon mustard instead of yellow mustard, since it was what I had. YUM!

These were a huge hit at my family Halloween party. I did add more lite mayonnaise and sugar free pickle relish. I will definitely make these again next year!

Fun idea! I used a red edible food coloring pen to draw veins on the white of the eggs to really make them look like eyes.

AWESOME recipe.  For those of you who are wondering too...I used red food coloring and a toothpick to do the red on the eyes.

This was the first time I made the halloween deviled eggs.  It was really fun!!  I don't really measure my ingredients, but I use all of these and some horseradish.  I made the yolk green by adding blue food coloring to the yellow yolk mixture, and I made the eyes look bloodshot by using a toothpick dipped in red food coloring.

Although your "recipe" is nearly identical to mine (sans the green food coloring) I have to offer 5 stars for creativity. Would do more stars if I could.  My GK's love Gma's deviled eggs and this is a fantastic idea. I'll be at their house for halloween and I cannot wait to do this for them...and yeah, for me, too!

This was a great idea.  I put a few drops of red food coloring in the water before boiling the eggs.  This gave the egg whites some red.  They disappeared quickly at our halloween party.

While I made this and another deviled egg as a last minute add to my dinner party. They were a huge it and soo laughable too. My family and my guest really loved them. And these were really good and the flavor was pretty good with pickle relish in them. Not something I would normally put in deviled eggs. But the flavor was really nice. Thanks. I can see me making these again next year.

Didn't follow the recipe exactly, so 5-stars for inspiration and for the collective advice in other reviews.
My changes/notes:
* I used green food coloring for the filling and it worked pretty well.  I pretty much used my own deviled egg recipe (no relish, more mayo), and used the 'plastic bag' filling approach.
* I made the red 'blood' from a little bit of mayo and red food coloring.  It started more red (less pink), so I'll wait until I'm closer to presentation before adding, next year.
* Started with sliced olives and didn't love the look.  Moved to half olives for a rounder pupil.

LOVED this recipe and my kids really enjoyed decorating - I didn't have any toothpicks so the 'blood veins' didn't come out quite right but overall very fun and delicious! (Our picture is the one on the bat shaped plate at the top.)  Great family time! The kids didn't like the black olives, so I let them decorate with colored icing - it added a bit of sweetness to the eggs (to much for me) but the kids loved it. =-)

Good party dish. I had trouble making the bloodshot eyes, so I just sprinkled a bit of paprika on top instead.

I didn't think that these eggs were any better than my normal recipe. However, the idea of making them into eyes was a shot of genious! I used food coloring paste rather then paprika for the blood part. They looked great! What a fun addition to our Halloween tablescape. Thanks for sharing your creativity!

I'd like to give this a 4.5, but it won't let me.  I took other people's suggestions and used blue food coloring to mix with the egg yolks, but then I went back and added green for a darker color.  I also used mayo mixed with red food coloring for the bloodshot eyes.  Right now, my picture is the one posted above.  They were fairly simple to make, though, and I'm sure they'll be a hit at the party I'm attending tonight.

I have been making these for so many years now I've lost count. From pre-school to H.S. parties they are a continuous hit. Yes the mayo does have to be bumped up for sure since you want your filling creamy. For the crazy crowd or adult parties reserve some of the yolk mixture and tint it RED, then add 1/2- 1 t cayenne for zip! and you have angry eyes. For effect use a piping bag for filling the egg whites. Even non egg eaters seem to like these.

I give it 5 stars for the idea, although I used my own deviled egg recipe.  Yolks and mayo to consistency, then cajun spices to taste.  And since I really hate olives, I just used the yolk mix for all parts.  I separated out a small amount, added paprika, colored that red and made the bloodshot lines.  I colored a large portion green and the remainder black.  Tastes just like my normal deviled eggs, and looks great for Halloween!

I made these for our annual Halloween party and they were a huge hit. I left out the sweet pickle relish, but added some garlic powder and parsley. Next time I am going to make two batches since I didn't even get to try any!!

These were a big hit! We used 4 tbsp of mayo and added a pinch of garlic and cayenne, as well as paprika sprinkle for the red eye effect.

These were great.  I'll admit to just using my standard "throw in some stuff from the fridge" recipe for deviled eggs (I have to use my mom's homemade relish!) but then colored the filling green and followed everything else!  They looked awesome and were easy, too.  Too cute!

I didn't have food coloring, I used spicy brown mustard, and added siracha for the eyeball veins. It wasn't pretty or have as much bite as  I wanted, but still a party favorite. I'll keep playing with more spices and make it again

These where good, I did the traditional recipe for the yolk with the mayo and vinegar, but I did add relish as this recipe requires, it was a nice addition. It was pretty difficult to draw on the blood shot lines on the eggs though, hopefully next time I make them I will think of a better strategy!

This is such a fun idea and a hit at my Halloween party! I prefer to make my deviled eggs a certain way so did not necessarily follow the recipe to a "T"; however, I used a couple drops of food coloring and olives to transform the dish per the recipe. To make the red lines, I put paprika in a bowl and added water by the dropper to make a paste. Will definitely make this again next Halloween!

Overall-yummy and attractive; however, I had to add more mustard, mayo, and relish to get the right consistency for the egg yoke. Thank you for the great Halloween party idea.

I used my own deviled egg recipe.  I used the black olives as suggested, but put a piece of chopped pimento for the pupil.  I don't own a deviled egg holder so I put them in a small muffin pan and used some fake blood to decorate the pan - it looks perfectly gross.

This was easy and fun to make! Although I had to add about 4 T of mayo to get it what I feel is the proper consistency. I did not use the green food coloring and they still looked like eyeballs. Thanks for sharing!

Excellent!!!  I made my own filling with the yolks. I added blue to it to make green. I set some aside without food coloring for the middle eye dot. I used a toothpick and red coloring for the veins. Easy peasy. I layed them on a bed of shredded cabbage I blanched, dried off with paper towels then added green, blue coloring mixture to it to turn it mossy looking. Everyone at my daughters Halloween party loved them. Thanks soo much. These were a huge hit. I always come to Allrecipes for ideas and recipes.

I made these for a Halloween party and they were a hit.  I used green olives instead of black because they were already stuffed.  For the red veins I used a tooth pick dipped in red food coloring.  They looked fabulous and tasted great.

This was a hit at our Halloween party. I did have to make some slight modifications. Doubled the mayo, mustard and relish and ran it through a mixer to make it less thick in order to use a decorator. I also used dill relish instead of sweet per our preference. The green food coloring worked perfect for this. Some were even hesitant to eat not knowing what the "green stuff" was. Very fun!

Tried this recipe.  Made a few changes (as some have suggested); added a little sour cream to cream better, Dijon mustard, no vinegar and mixed w/ electric mixer, 3 drops of tabasco sauce (for flavor) and put 4 drops of the blue food coloring in the mix, then put into sandwich bag and made a hole to fill the whites.  I sprinkled paprika on the egg whites prior to filling them, and we don't care for black olives so I used pimento stuffed green olives.  See picture attached.  They taste delicious!

I made these using my own deviled egg recipe - miracle whip and a tsp of dijon mustard. I use colour pastes for cake decorating and they worked perfect here because they are concentrate and not a liquid. Green for the yolk and red for the veins. I used a toothpick for the veins. The only issue I had was with the black olives. This was a children's party. Most of the kids just picked the olives off, but some wouldn't touch them because of it. I would love to hear some suggestions for a substitute, can't think of anything off hand.

Made these for a Halloween party. They were a huge hit. I made two dozen and they were gone quicker than the catered food. Love the little bit of different flavor the celery salt added.

This was a hit with the kids at my party!  It's a good recipe for deviled eggs and looked just gross enough to please all the ghouls  there!  The only thing I didn't use was the pickle relish.

These are so cute! The definitely need more mayo though. I added 3 Tbs. I also used paprika mixed with water (to create a sort of paprika paste)  for the veins. Thanks!

We had so much fun making these. We made no substitutions, and they turned out just right for a Halloween party appetizer.

Eggs were good (who doesn't love a devilled egg?) but it think could have used a little more mayo. Or maybe just some spice to flavour them up a bit. Taste wise there were a little dull. Still looked neat but how did people get the paprika to look like bloodshot eyes? Mine just looked like random straight lines.

These were a huge hit at our Halloween party. I used double the mayo and double the mustard otherwise it wasn't moist enough. I wasn't sure how the red lines were made in the picture so I used sprinkled paprika.

Made these for a Halloween party last Saturday and they were a smash hit. I didnt have any celery salt, but it must not have mattered much because these things were gobbled down so fast that I didnt even get to try one :(  They're also alot of fun to make, and really do look cool. Make sure you do the red food coloring toothpick technique to make the eyes look even more realistic!

These came out great but the bloodshot eyes were tough to do. I might try toe paprika note I saw in the reviews next time.

This is now my go to recipe for halloween. The first time I made it I followed the recipe very closely and everyone loved it. The lay few times I've added a purple less mayo and less relish, the flavor it still strong just not as fatty or acidic. The black olives for the eyes make the prefect spooky touch for a Halloween party. Highly recommend this recipe, you're guests will love it.
