I made these a few days go, but had a problem with it being too dry. I couldn't get it to form into a ball mixture. I scrapped the 1st batch and started over. I used about a cup less confectioner's sugar and that resulted in a better ball form. In the process of drying, it took more then 2 hours to dry. So I let them set over night. I went to dip into chocolate and they started to melt. Hence a 3rd batch. I tasted the mint mixture and the flavor was spot on. Love mint! However, My kids had other ideas in mind when I made them the 3rd time. I had them drying and proceeded to dip them yet again. To find my youngest had a tummy ache from eating the entire batch without them being dipped. So I never got a chance to dip them. SO a 4th time I made these, I'm now an expert, I warded off the kids from touching them until I was completely done. Now I finally got a great batch but still had to do with less powdered sugar then the recipe calls for around 4 1/2 to 5 cups of confectioner's sugar. All in all the result was very good. However a note for others. Have plastic wrap handy to cover the mixture as you are pinching off the dough to keep moist while you are working with it. It does start to dry out fast. Thanks I will make these again.

Wonderful recipe!  After shaping, I put in the freezer for about an hour and then dipped in melted semi sweet chocolate chips.  They turned out pretty and tasted great!  I will be making these as gifts for the holidays next year!

I loved this recipe! I love peppermint patties and thought these were close. The only difference is the milk chocolate instead of the dark that is used with the brand. My son told me he liked these better than the ones you buy. Very good! Thank you for the recipe.

These are better than any that you can buy in the store. However, you really need to make these small because a little goes a long way. I added a few tablespoons of corn syrup to the peppermint mixture because many reviews said they were dry. Then I rolled balls and flattened them. Then I froze the mints and dipped them while still frozen. I did not have any troubles with the mints melting.

Love this recipe! I've made these for the last 2 years and given them (along with my home made peanut butter cups) to my daughters' teachers. I follow the recipe as written but instead of rolling it out, I roll the dough into little balls and flatten them a bit I put a small amount of chocolate in the bottom of a MINI cupcake liner place the dough on top and cover with a little more chocolate. YUMMY and so pretty with Christmas themed paper liners

My husband loves peppermint patties so I made them for my Christmas baking and he loves them, my father in law ate 6 of them!! I used dark chocolate and a TBS of criso because it gives the chocolate a nice shine. This will be a Christmas tradition for years to come in our family!!

These taste very similar to York Peppermint Patties - Yum! The only difference is that they are a bit drier. They are also slightly difficult to dip in the chocolate -- I found it easier to press the mixture in a pan and pour the chocolate on top.

Excellent patties. Rich and smooth tasting.  Super simple to make and a wonderful gift. I used a can of store brand sweetened condensed milk and ended up needing a can and a half but still delicious and made a nice soft bowl of candy dough to work.

These were delicious!! The filling is a bit firmer than the real thing, but tastes just as good. I found they were very easy to form and dip. As long as the disks are dry they hold together great.

A bit difficult to dip, but taste great!  Just like the real thing.  I added vanilla extract and red food coloring to mine.  I did half in dark chocolate and the other half in milk chocolate.  Milk chocolate seemed to be a little smoother to work with.

These were Awesome!!! They were much better and the center was smoother than the ones you buy at the store. And they were super easy to make! I followed the directions exactly and I even let them dry out longer than the recipe called for and I did not have a problem with them being too dry. I did follow the advice to freeze them for about 15 mins before dipping in the chocolate and I used Ghirardelli's 60% Cacao choc chips. My only advice is to keep them small.. They are easier to dip and take out of the dip when they are smaller. I used a small melon ball scoop and broke that ball in half and rolled that into a ball and flattened. It was the perfect size. Next time I'm going to try making them w/ regular choc chips and white choc chips and I'll even try different extracts for the cream center. I'm going to have fun w/ these!

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!! Junior Mints are one of my favorites which have a milder peppermint flavor than Yorks so I only added 1 tsp. peppermint extract which was perfect! They tasted just like Junior Mints. I only added 4 1/2 cups powdered sugar so it wasn't dry like others complained about. To make it much easier, I made these in a 9x13 inch pan which I first greased, melted chocolate chips in the microwave and put a layer (whatever thickness you want) of chocolate down. I put it in the freezer for about 5 min to harden the chocolate and then put the peppermint filling on that. I then put a layer of melted chocolate on top of that.  After the chocolate hardens, cut into squares.  So easy!!

I just made a half batch of these, testing recipes for the one closest to York Peppermint Patties, which is my favorite candy.  I needen't look any farther.  I just blew up my stand mixer making dog biscuits, so I was hesitant to make a full batch with my little hand mixer, thinking the filling might be too stiff for it to handle.  It was perfect.  I make my own extracts and these are DELICIOUS using peppermint from my garden.  I'm going to make a btch of peppermint easter eggs to send to my son, who is also a YPP maven.  Can't wait to get his response.  I hand dipped the patties and got the semisweet chocolate coating a little too thick on some of them.  Next time I'm going to combine 2/3 semisweet with 1/3 milk chocolate to cut the flavor a bit.  I will say, these are GREAT and as easy as can be.  I had them mixed, kneaded, pinched onto cookie sheets and pressed in less than 30 minutes.  Go for it...they're delicious.

Followed the recipe to the T - Perfect!  People couldn't believe how good they were!  Don't believe the naysayers on this one, it is tops!  Thanks for sharing!!!  We will make these again and again.  Teenager even enjoyed helping make them and he ate them like they were store candies!
UPDATE:  Had to make some more - for a third time!  They are so delicious!  My Mom loves them as much as I do.

Great! I melt a combination of semisweet and bittersweet chocolate along with a tiny bit of paraffin wax in a double boiler for a more dippable consistency.

Excellent!! I used a mix of dark & milk chocolate chips w/ a little shortening instead because I'm not a fan of chocolate candy coating. I also added more peppermint - I like them strong! I experimented which turned out awesome: after I made the batch, I halved it. In one of the halves, I added a 1/4 cup dark chocolate baking cocoa, a tsp. more peppermint, and a splash of milk to get the right consistency. These double-chocolate patties turned out fantastic!! I was pretty unsuccessful at the dipping so I ended up just slavering each side with the melted chocolate. I used my finger to make swirl patterns. Turned out quite pretty!

Not my favorite kind. To dry and not very tasty. I think I will stick to the recipe with the cream cheese in it.

I have made the patties twice so far, and they have been great both times (especially frozen!) Following another review's suggestion, I used roughly half a cup less powdered sugar and they were the right balance between moist and dry/set. I also changed the milk chocolate to a semisweet and bittersweet chocolate blend. My fellow nurses on the night shift agreed that they were very refreshing at 3am!

All I have to say is amazing. First of all I did not use a tablespoon of peppermint extract. I used like 1 and a half because the mint that I had was too strong. I needed sugar into the dough until it was the right consistancy and then let them dry for a day. I dipped them in dark chocolate and they taste exactly like York's! We are fighting over them seriously.

I LOVE Peppermit Patties so I thought I'd give this recipe a try.  I had an 11 year old helping me and we had a BLAST making these!  Not only were they super easy, but they turned out PERFECT!  The recipe yielded a LOT so I took some to work.  They were snatched up in no time!  Everyone raved about them.  Compared to the price of ones you buy at the store, these are so economical and freeze wonderfully.

These turned out great.  It was so fun to make homemade peppermint patties.  The second time I made these I swapped raspberry extract for the peppermint and they were really good too.  I think I will try orange next time!

These were fun and easy to make, did it with my 3-year-old, he liked the flattening part. Made it for a book club treat and got a lot of positive feedback. But I was not dying over them. I want to try them again but use dark chocolate.

I tried this recipe for the first time. It was great!! I rolled the dough into 1/2 inch balls and dipped them into dark chocolate. I call them peppermint bites. I sell them and people love them.

Good but not amazing. I don't know what would make them better but I'd like them a little creamier. I only used about 3/4 of the sugar listed but thought they were still a little dry. Good flavour though.

Delicious and rich. I made these and took them to work.  Everyone loved them!  I made a variation by adding 2 Tbspns cherry juice and a drop of red food coloring.  I had beautiful pink cherry peppermint patties.  I will make this again for easter using easter food coloring and other flavoring. So pretty!

Very good & surprisingly simple to make.  They look beautiful.  Could use a smidge more peppermint, but that could have been my son who helped put in more of a scant tablespoon.  I'd like to try with dark chocolate next time!

I have made this recipe for the last 4 years and everyone loves them.  The first year my sister in law didn't believe that I made them, she thought I had just unwrapped York peppermint patties.

These turned out great - but weren't the easiest in the world to make. Based on others reviews, I started with only 4 cups of sugar. However, I ended up with a sticky, chewed bubble-gum type consistency that was horrible to work with. So, I continued to add a bit more sugar until I got to a consistency that could be easily rolled into a ball. I'm guessing I ended up around 5 cups of sugar. I'm not familiar with Candy chocolate, so I used a mix of semi-sweet and dark chocolate chips (with added oil as noted on the package for dipping fruit.) It worked - but these were a real pain to dip so I think next time I'll try the candy chocolate. Everyone who tried them - loved them, though!

These are superb.  Measure the sugar closely.  I was a bit over, and they were a difficult to shape (too crumbly).  They're not kidding when they say that the yield 8 dozen.  That's 8 dozen little balls to shape, press and dip.  So, plan several hours for this project.  But, they're well worth it!!!

So fun and they taste very similar to York. Make sure you use peppermint extract. I used a peppermint/spearmint blend and mine didn't taste exactly the same. Flipping them is key to getting the rippled look. I don't think my batch made nearly 8 dozen. Maybe 4 dozen at most.

I was looking for something fairly simple to add to Christmas gifts and this was one of the candies I chose.  After reading ALL the reviews, I was prepared to add extra powdered sugar, to not use as much powdered sugar, more peppermint, less peppermint, etc.

I used about the powdered sugar called for - added some for kneading at the end.  I started out with 2 tsps. of peppermint because what I had was quality oil.  It was way too strong.  I doubled the batch and it's still a bit stronger than I'd like, but the chocolate helped some with that.  Next time, I'd start w/ about 1/2 tsp. and test before I added more.

I froze them as posters suggested and that worked beautifully.  I had 24 per pan in the freezer and really, I could have thrown them back in after about 15 of them so they'd handle better.

They look great.  They taste great (like I said, a little bit strong on the peppermint for me).  I made those for the last 2 pans smaller and I like how they look better.  I'll definitely make these again.

this recipe started off strong, and then totally crumbled.  how do you create a dough ball from the evaporated milk and confectioners sugar? it turned into a blob of goo, and i couldn't even get it off the counter top.  so i tried it again, but this time didn't attempt the "dough ball" and just dipped from my bowl of ingredients.  i used the candy coating, as the recipe called for, but like another reviewer, my filling completely melted in the chocolate.  there was absolutely no structure to my "york patties".  It may be tasty, but it is completely unidentifiable, and easily the messiest recipe i've ever dealt with.  i'd love any hints or suggestions from the reviewers who loved this recipe.

They taste really good. Just a little difficult to make and you have to try making it once to figure out the nuances. Like, how much chocolate to use for each patty, and that you have to make them small to have enough chocolate for all of them if you only use the amount the recipe calls for.

This is a really tasty recipe. I found that I had the opposite problem from a lot of the other reviewers here: the filling was too wet. I couldn't form it into balls. I threw caution to the wind and just added more icing sugar until it looked promising (and extra cup or two, plus another cup for kneading the filling) and went on from there.

The filling still didn't want to stay together to be dipped into the chocolate, so I just poured chocolate over the top and froze the patties. For all the finickiness, they turned out great! Really delicious, and worth the little headaches.
