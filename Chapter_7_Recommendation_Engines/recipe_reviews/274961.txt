The only negative I had was the chickpea pasta.  The consistency just wasn't 'quite right'.  Other than that the dish was tasty!  Full disclosure, I didn't have sherry vinegar so I used balsamic vinegar instead.  That wasn't the issue with the actual pasta.  Will make again with regular pasta shells.
