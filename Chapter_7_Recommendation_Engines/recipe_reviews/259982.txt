These were delicious and a party hit!  I added a little more spice by adding a hotter salsa and it made it not too spicy but sweet and spicy at the same time.

I needed to test this recipe before I c for others during the holidays. This recipe was simple and fantastic!  Who knew by combining whole cranberry and chili sauces provide an incredible and different sauce.  As another reviewer recommended by another reviewer, I used the Gardein vegetarian meatballs and we had these meatballs for dinner with plain rice and veggies. Great recipe.

Wow, this turned out to be super delicious!   It is such an easy recipe too.  I will use this at future potlucks as it's sure to be a crowd pleaser.  I made exactly as recipe states with the exception of adding a tad more lemon juice!

Delicious sauce! I used Gardien veggie meatless balls, so I added about a cup of water since no fat would be rendered . I stirred every 30 minutes. Served over rice with a salad. Delicious , hubby loved it.

I made this for a work potluck. I tripled the receipe and luckly grabbed to taste because an hour later they were all gone! Big hit, we liked the sweet of the cranberry with the kick of the chili sauce.

I took these to a small group event where we all brought “party foods.” They were a hit. One lady told me she had made these before but with the grape jelly recipe and liked them so much better! I agree!

I made it just as the recipe stated. Next time I make it, I'll make homemade meatballs. Otherwise, it was easy and the sauce was very good!
