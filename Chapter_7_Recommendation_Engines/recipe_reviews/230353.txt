I think this chicken needed something else.  A herb perhaps?  I like lemon and mustard but I was off set with honey.  I've had BBQ chicken with a bit of sweetness but I didn't like the sweetness on this one and it was only 1 TBSP of honey.  I can only say try and you may like it.  I didn't HATE it...just felt that I've tasted better.

So easy and so yummy! I only marinated them for 4 hours and they were still great.

I am a novice cook but I loved the simplicity in the ingredients (which were readily available in most home kitchens) and the preparation. The hardest part was just waiting the 6 hours for the marinade to set into the chicken but once it was grilled, I found the chicken to be really tasty and delicious with a good blend of flavors. I really enjoyed this recipe.

I added fresh Rosemary and a 1/4 cup of apple vinegar to reduce the sweetness and bring out the rosemary.  Very nice!

It was amazing. I didn't have a grill so I baked it. I let it marinade over night instead and it was amazing had I been able to grill it I'm sure there would have been even more amazing flavors. Even my kids enjoyed it and that says a lot! Wish I could some how upload my pic to this website.

This was a great starting base. I adjusted for ingredients I had in the house and serves it with chili garlic saut√©ed red Cabage and zucchini. I also used a just spicy brown mustard. We will be having it again.

We loved this recipe. Perfect balance of sweet and mustard. Also added a couple of smashed garlic cloves. I will definitely make this again.
