Nice sweet dessert slaw. I used half sour cream, half yogurt. This did need a tad more sour cream/yogurt. I did plump my raisins with hot apple juice and drained/patted them dry before stirring them into the slaw. I also used colored marshmallows. My kids especially liked this.

Very good snack, but I will leave out the marshmallows next time, their texture did not work for me in this.

Very good.  I didn't have marshmallows but the salad was very good without them.  I'm grateful for a carrot salad without mayo and this was perfect.  I thought it might need some honey or stevia but with the pineapple it is sweet enough for me.  Thanks Aimee.
