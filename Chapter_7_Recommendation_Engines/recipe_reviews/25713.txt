This is gooood!!!  Most of the people on here that said it wasn't good substituted ingredients. I did have to use a different pasta... but still used spinach pasta, just a different noodle.  It turned out great.  Thank you Perri for your recipe.

This soup is unbelievable. I'm not a big soup fan, but it sounded like it'd be different and tasty - and it is. My 10 and 11 year olds had seconds and thirds (they didn't care for the zucchini - but they're kids!) Like some other reviewers, I thought there wasn't quite enough liquid, so I added about one more cup of beef broth and about 1/4 cup more of wine - just right for our taste. I also didn't use fettucine - thought it would be hard to consume in  a soup, so instead I used spinach penne pasta - it was perfect. I made plenty so I gave some to neighbors and they all loved it. Thanks for the recipe.

Great but don't add too many noodles or they will soak up all the good juices and it turns into a stew. Break up the noodles also to make it easier to serve and eat. I also increased the basil. (After making this for the last couple of years, I have modified it a bit. I don't put in the pasta. Now I cook tortellinis separately and add into each bowl before ladling in the soup. Then I sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Wonderful. Loved by all.)

Italian vegetable soups (minestrone) lend themselves well to preparing with, and making use of, whatever vegetables you have on hand.  Given Hubs and I are returning to Italy in a couple of days, this was very appropriate in more ways than just its name! In keeping with the utilitarian aspect of Italian soups I was lucky not to have to buy anything from the grocery store as I had zucchini, green peppers and fresh parsley in my garden.  I also had Swiss chard, which was a fine addition.  I removed the sausage from the casings and used a little less wine. This is hearty and flavorful and now that it’s prepared it will be a cinch to serve (again) with minimal clean-up whenever we are ready to sit down and eat.  But I do have some criticisms of the recipe if prepared as written.  First, using whole peeled tomatoes without crushing or chopping them wouldn’t work well. I don’t think you’d want or like a whole tomato (or two or three) in your soup bowl. Second, a pound of pasta is a LOT of pasta for this.  Half that is plenty. And fettuccine is not a good choice for soup.  I prepared this on the stove-top rather than the slow cooker, simmering for about an hour, then adding the zucchini the last 10 minutes, and finally the cooked pasta (I used shells and elbows to use up small amounts I had left of both) after that. Last but certainly not least, be sure to sprinkle your bowl of soup with freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano.

This is a wonderful soup and one I use very often for family and friends!  Instead of the 16 ounces of fettucine I use 8 ounces of small seashell pasta or a bag of frozen O'Brien potatoes. Also, instead of the zucchini I have used spinach or kale. Always a hit!  Thanks for sharing.

MMMMM....This reminds me of a soup served by a popular Italian restaurant chain. This ia GREAT in the crock pot!!!! I remove casing from sausage, use white wine instead of red (personal preference), and use cheese filled pasta. Our favorite addition is to sprinkle shredded mozzerella on top each serving and let it melt. Gooey and delish!!!! Dont forget the bread!

Delicious!  Since we like spicy food, I used hot Italian sausage in place of the sweet. Next time I will follow another reviewer's suggestion and use elbow macaroni instead of fettucine.  Even though I cut the fettucine noodles up, they still made the soup hard to spoon up.  Thanks for sharing, Perri.

I have prepared this soup a few times for my family, and it is such a hit with them. The only recommendation I would make would be to add less red wine because the full cup and a half required can be over-powering.

We absolutely LOVED this soup!!  I made it last night and we're having it again tonight.  We NEVER do that!  I added one more cup of beef broth, bag of spinach instead of zucchini and cheese tortellini, which I cooked separately and spooned into bowls before covering with soup.  This is a definite keeper!  Oh - Also I used bulk Italian sweet sausage instead of links.  So much easier to eat with a spoon!

This is my recipe, I don't know what I was thinking when I posted it but I only use half the pasta and break it in half. It is very good with tortellini!

My husband told me this was his favorite thing I have ever cooked for him!  We ate this for days after I cooked it and it was better each time! Taking the advice of others, I doubled the garlic, added 2 tablespoons of tomato paste, used spicy sausage, and used tortellini instead of fettuccine.   I would recommend adding the zucchini half way through cooking so it does not get too soggy.   This is my favorite meal I've ever made from this website!

I only used 12 oz pasta - which turned out great, but make sure you stir it so that it does not stick to the bottom and burn, like in my case!  It has great flavor, and I may try cooking the fettuccini on the side, as the soup came out starchy and a lot of the liquid was absorbed, so there was no 'soup' leftover.  Very good though!

My family LOVED it!  I sent a bowl over to my friend and she called while she was eating it to say how good it was.  The only change I would make is to use mini elbows instead of the fettucini.  It would be easier to eat with a spoon.  The soup is easy to make and delicious!

I love this recipe!  I am not much of a cook and am always looking for something easy.  One box of pasta is a bit much though; you may want to cut it in half.                                                                                       Tracy

Very good. We love slow cooker soups, esp. now that fall is coming on. Re the tomatoes - sometimes you just have to use your common sense. Even tho the recipe doesn't tell you to chop the tomatoes, go ahead and do it!

I made this recipe over the weekend, it was delicious, however I recommend not putting the pasta in unless you plan on eating the entire batch in one sitting. The pasta tends to absorb all the broth and gets mushy, the next time I make it (and I will make it again) I will only put the pasta in each individual serving reserving the rest of the pasta for the next meal.

I made this for the first time ever and all I changed was the broth.  I didn't have but one can of beef broth, so I added the rest low fat chicken broth.  Served it with garlic bread and used macaroni for noodles. Delicious.   Will definitely make this again and again in my slow cooker.

UPDATED: THIS ROCKS! MADE THIS AGAIN, BUT THIS TIME I MADE A COUPLE OF CHANGES. TO START, I USED ONLY ONE (LARGE) ZUCCHINI. WHAT REALLY MADE A DIFFERENCE WAS THE ADDITION OF 1 T ITALIAN SEASONING (IN ADDITION TO THE SPICES CALLED FOR) AND HOT ITALIAN SAUSAGE. FYI: A CHEAP CABERNET SAUVIGNON WORKED JUST FINE IN THIS (DON'T WASTE YOUR $'S ON AN EXPENSIVE WINE!!!). MY HUSBAND RAVED HOW GOOD THIS WAS. :) WOW, WOW, WOW!!! This was just "OK" for me. Considering how little effort is required to throw this together, I guess I can't be too picky.... :) As a general rule of thumb, my hubs and I rarely share the same culinary POV - but that wasn't the case this time. Not only did we mutually agree that our soup was bland, we also felt it called for FAR too much zucchini (and we both enjoy this vegetable a LOT!). I'm not saying this was terrible, it just wasn't what I / we expected (everything smelled DIVINE when I dumped it in the slow cooker). Perhaps with a little added spice and HALF the amount of zucchini called for, this could have potential. NOTE: If using the fettuccine pasta, be SURE to break it up first (it's a lot easier to eat this way). Thanks for sharing, Perri. :-)

This was good the day I made it but great the day after! We ate it almost all week. I did not use the pasta listed but what I had on hand (garden rotini) and waited until I served it to add it. Will make again.

To make the pasta "bite-sized," I broke it down into six pieces as I put it into the boiling water.  This is a very good soup that's even better the next day.  Freezes well.

This soup got 5 stars from all of my family members.  I made the following substitutions:
1.  Used fresh spinach instead of zucchini
2.  Used frozen tortellini instead of the fettuccine

Absolutely FABULOUS!!!  One of the best tasting and easily prepared, but the flavor....OH MY!!!!  Would not put in all the pasta though, although yummie, it was just heavier.  My husband did the shopping and couldn't find the "16" oz package of spinach fettuccine, so he purchased a 14 oz., which was more than enough.  Great, GREAT SOUP!!!!

i've made this twice now- it is good! i keep the pasta on the side (cheese tortellini is great!), as suggested by other reviews. i coarse-cut the tomatoes and also add an extra cup or so of broth to make it less ragout like. i've made italian sausage soup using other recipes, but this is by far the best, at least in my opinion!

I had to use sausage links and remove the casings (takes no time at all) as my grocery store was out of the bulk sweet Italian sausage.Then just cook as you would ground beef. You have to make this at least once with the sweet sausage to see how good it is! Then substitute other meat if you wish. Since I am on Atkins I did reduce the amt of the pasta. It was so good that I made two pots! In the second one I used a roasted garlic and tomato basil flavored pasta and that was great too! I made it for my girlfriends for a dinner and movie night at my house and they all wanted the recipe! I will definitely make this one again with no changes. My husband loved it too!

This soup was great.  I used hot Italian sausage, and substituted green beans for the green bell pepper.  I also used spinach tortellini instead of spinach fettuccine.  I served it with garlic bread.  Yum!

didn't have all of the ingredients so I used diced carrots, celery, onions, garlic, 2 cans of diced tomatoes, fresh parsley, basil, and oregano, with penne pasta, didn't add as much red wine for I thought it would be too over powering....topped with mozzarella cheese...delish

This was pretty good. My first time making soup and it turned out well.  Def use sausage. I used plain Italian seasoned sausage but I think next time I will spring for the sweet sausage just b/c I love the taste. (Italian seasoned was on sale this week) I used 1 can of whole tomatoes and one can of diced to even out the big and little chunks. I love tomatoes so the big ones were a treat. Def wait to put the noodles in until ready to serve and if you aren't gong to eat the whole pot, leave them out. They do suck up the broth.  I also added a 1/2 bag of baby spinach for more veggies. I didn't need to add salt since the broth had salt, the tomatoes had some, and the sausage was seasoned.  Be careful if you do. I tried the suggestions of adding parmesan when serving--- a wonderful idea. Another way to add flavor w/o too much salt!

The original was awful.  The red wine was so overpowering.  I remade it without the wine and used chicken broth.  It was soooo much better.

I made this for the first time and I'm eating it right now: delicious! I used hot Italian turkey sausage, uncased, and shiraz for the wine. I also took one reviewer's suggestion and sprinkled with a little mozzarella before serving. My only complaint: the directions didn't say anything about cutting the tomatoes, so I have a about 10 whole tomatoes floating in the finished soup, which was a little weird. I also should have cut the pasta -- it's a bit difficult to eat full linguini strands with a spoon.

This was excellent!! I used turkey sausage, since I had it on hand.  Otherwise followed the recipe until the end. When I make soup, and it is nearly finished, I start sampling and tayloring the taste.  For this one, I finally added 8 oz of sour cream, and the soup was "scrumptious".  By the second day, it had become a delicacy!  We all loved it.
 6/9/14.  Made it again, following the recipe pretty closely, using regular sweet sausage as called for.  Did not use crockpot.  Why should one use it for this when all you have to do is simmer it on the stovetop.  Also, added about 3 cubic inches of Velveeta, because I like the cheesy effect.

Excellent, although I would change the pasta. The fettucine was difficult and sloppy to eat, flicking broth everywhere. Stick with a smaller noodle of your choice instead.

Wonderful soup!!!  I only made a slight change of eliminating the fetuccini and adding cheese tortellini when ready to serve.  My stomach and onions don't get along but dehydrated ones are okay so I threw in an envelope of dry onion soup mix, and used just a bit more zucchini.  I used turkey sausage to keep the fat down and no one knew the difference.  I also try to watch our sodium so I used low sodium beef broth.  The wine adds a wonderful flavor, but a full bodied one is a must!  My friend used this recipe with a lighter red like pinot noir and it didn't turn out as good.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I had some Italian sausage and wanted to try something different - this was it! Instead of pasta, I used frozen pillows of ravioli (I've also used frozen tortellini), and served with our favorite Rosemary Bread (on this site). Excellent & delicious!

I like sausage soup, but hubby's not too crazy about it. (when I said he was picky...I wasn't kidding!!) So I don't get around to making it very often.  But when I do, I don't add the noodles or green pepper.  I like to use zucchini instead.  For some reason the noodles end up getting soggy and don't make good leftovers.  There are some wonderful cornbread recipes on this site that go perfect with this soup.  Thanks Perri.

I converted this recipe for the Crockpot, since I'm a working Mom and love the ease of cooking with a crockpot.  I browned the sausage, onion and garlic first and then added all the rest of the ingredients except the noodles and zuchinni.  I let it cook all day and then added a box of frozen green beans (thawed) about 45 minutes before I served dinner.  I cooked cheese filled spinach tortelinis on the side and placed a helping in each bowl and then added the soup over top.  Served it with mozzarella garlic cheese bread.  Family thought it was OK but not the best soup I've ever made.  May try it again someday and try using the spicy sasuage instead of the mild to give it a little more zing.

great easy soup recipe - I followed it exactly with the exception of the green pepper which I left out.  The spinach pasta was really good- I broke the feffuccine up in small pieces before cooking it and adding it to the soup.  I also added a few drops of Franks Red Hot Sauce - yummy

I didn't like this for two main reasons. The flavor seemed to only be salt and the heat from the sausage (and I used mild sausage). And the zucchini turned into mushy yuck. When I first put it in the soup it was so fresh and pretty looking with nice texture. By serving time, flabby and Army green. (I should have known better. And I did put it in later in the cooking, but not late enough.) Many seem to have enjoyed this, so I guess this is just not the soup for me. It also seemed like WAY more than 8 servings!

A HUGE hit with friends and family!  Even with changes to accomodate on-hand ingredients; such as using both sweet italian and spicy italian sausage, using Marsala wine instead of red, using the stuffed tortellini as suggested and throwing in a bit of chopped Jalapeno - this soup was awesome!!  Definately a versatile keeper, and I'll be making this one again and again!  Yummy!

Too much wine for our taste.  I will make again with less wine and use cheese stuffed tortellini instead of spinach pasta, adding it about 10 minutes before serving so it will not be too soft.

This soup is awesome! My boyfriend gave it three thumbs up and said it was as good as his mother's soup! I did make a few modifications as follows: omitted bell pepper as I just don't like it, used 1 fresh tomato and one can RoTel tomatoes to spice things up, added three potatoes, didn't have any red wine, didn't have any pasta. I will definitely make this again and try to find the spinach pasta and/or try the mushrooms someone suggested. Thanks, Perri!

I don't even like sausage all that well and this was a great recipe! My hubby loves sausage so I made it for him. It was soooooo... good that I took the leftovers to work the next day! I didn't have zuchini so I used frozen mixed veggies instead. And I used cheese tortilini instead of spinach noodles. Those were the only alterations I made and let me just say...this is a winner. I heard my hubby telling someone how good it was! We've been married almost 29 yrs. and he rarely comments on the menu! I'll be making this again!

I made this exactly as the recipe says, except for the pasta.  I broke into bite size pieces before boiling, and stored separately.  I added the pasta per bowl when reheating because we like pasta firm and "unsoaked" and smaller pieces make it easier to eat at work.  This was extremely tasty, the kids liked it too.  I can't wait to make this for guests, it's very elegant with little effort.  I think I will use spicy/hot sausage next time.

Great recipe! I bought a package of mild and a package of hot italian sausage - 1 pound each since they do not come in half pound packages and omitted the pepper in the recipe. This is delish!!  I bought some of that jalepeno cheese bread from the grocery store bakery to dip in it and I have to say this was divine!

I used penne instead of fettuccine pasta and I realized to late I forgot to buy the zucchini!  So I used some green beans from our garden instead and they were perfect!  Some really good tasty soup, everybody went back for seconds!

This was very easy to make in the slow cooker and very tasty.  My husband wants to try "hot sausage" in the recipe next time.  Donner

This was an excellent recipe.  I, too, used spinach penne instead of spinach fettucini.  I did not transfer this into a slow cooker--I simply cooked it in the pot I started with.  I also did not boil the pasta separately--I added the pasta at the end to the entire mix--I simply added it to the mix.  It ate like a meal, rather than a soup, so if you're looking to make it thicker and less soupier, add the pasta directly to the mix.  I highly recommend this recipe as easy to prepare and very delicious.

Very good, didn't use the spinach fettucine, used a pasta I had on hand and I simmered everything together on the stove for awhile.

This was a pretty good dish, I think I will make it again and use the right sausage- I used some rather boring stuff, which didn't taste very good, but that was my fault. I didn't use the wine in it, and used regular pasta, but added a bit of spinach in the soup to add some flavor. My partner enjoyed it, but it was not his favourite. I might make it again. We ate leftovers the next day, and it was better than the first night!

I made this soup and subsituted the pasta for cheese tortilinis. It was wondrful. Husband thought so too....he had two bowls full. He also asked that I share the leftovers with his parents. My father in law said the only thing wrong  with it was that I did not bring him enough. I will be making this again.

This is relatively simple to make and very tasty.  Don't care for zucchini so substituted fresh spinach. For my taste, I had to "kick it up a notch" by adding Worchestershire and Tobasco, but basically the recipe was the same.  Some might be tempted to leave out the wine, but I think it adds a depth of flavor not duplicated by just using broth. It's a good soup.

Yummy! Followed it as closely as I could. Used white wine(because that's all I had on hand,)and took another's advise and added the zucchini the last hour just to keep it from getting too mushy( but probably would be fine either way). Used cut up tomatoes instead of whole and hot Italian sausage (again all I had on hand).Didn't have fresh parsley so used 1/2 the amount dried, added the cooked pasta(I used shells) to individual bowls only because I planned to have lots of leftovers and didn't want the noodles to absorb all the liquid for he next day. Have made it twice so far , the first time exactly as written, the second time using what I had on hand, both were eaqually delicious!! Thanks for the recipe:-)

I read lots of the reviews so I decided to add the zucchini late in the cooking time and added spinach too. We like spicy food so I used half hot sausage and half sweet.  I used a pound of each.  I used fresh basil and cheese stuffed spinach tortellini.  I have pest tortellini so I might use that in the winter months since fresh basil won't be available in the quantity that I would want.  This soup is a keeper.  It smells wonderful while cooking and tastes as good as it smells.  Very filling.

Supererb!! The only thing I changed was my cooking method...instead of a crockpot, I boiled everything in a large pot for about 30 mins (I did brown the sausage as the recipe directed prior to though, then I cut them into bite size pieces). The soup was absolutely delicious! A keep for me & the Hubby!!

Delicious!  I substituted cooked rice for the pasta (to make it gluten free).  A unique comfort food for those cold winter days.

We all love this soup! It has great flavor. I add a mixture of fresh soup herbs, a can of northern white beans and use ditalina pasta instead of fettucine.

Very good, although I had to kick up the flavors a bit.  I used 6 cloves of garlic.  For that much soup, 2 cloves simply do not suffice.  I added red pepper for heat, rosemary, fennel seed and thyme.  I also added 2 t. tomato paste to intensify the tomato flavor.  Instead of using spinach pasta, I added spinach tortellini as many reviewers suggested.  Overall, delicious.

This soup was delicious. I made a mistake and purchased link sausage (one big long link) so sliced it after cooking it, didn't have any green pepper so omitted that, didn't have any whole tomatoes so used sliced stewed tomatoes (which based on other reviews might be a good thing as whole tomatoes would be too big if they didn't break down...) - used cheese filled tortellini for the pasta and just threw it in about an hour before dinner - absolutely DELICIOUS with crusty bread and a salad.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

Excellent! I did make some minor changes based on items I had on hand. I used a package of frozen spinach instead of zucchini, and some tri-color rottini pasta. The soup was very, very good! Next time, though, I will add some pasta to the bowls then add some soup to eat right away, and only add the rest of the pasta to the rest of the soup after it cools. The soup was so hot that the pasta continued to cook, and when I ate some leftovers the next day, the pasta was mushier than I would have liked. Will definitely make this again. Thank you for a terrific recipe!

I absolutely love this recipe and serve it whenever guests come into town.  I usually use spinach (either fresh or the bagged frozen) rather than zucchini and I have made it with only 1 lb. sausage, and it always turns out amazing.  I also use cheese tortellini, as another reviewer noted.  Great recipe!

Eh, didn't care for this, but my husband enjoyed it.  After cooking for the time stated in the recipe, I thought the green pepper strongly dominated the sauce.  In fact, after only one hour cooking, I tasted the dish and felt the flavors were more well-balanced than the end result.  So... if made again, I would probably shave off an hour or two of cooking time.

This was a very good recipe.  After 4 hours in the crockpot, mine was not as thick as I would have liked.  I ended up putting it on the stove, adding some cornstarch to thicken.  It turned out great.  Next time I would add dried spinach tortellini rather than fresh since the fresh is not bite size.  I change to a 28 oz dice tomato and 14 1/2 oz petite dice tomato both drained.  I also added about 1 tbls of tomato paste and a dash of italian seasoning.  It turned out to be a great dinner on a chilly evening.

VERY yummy! I love the red wine flavor in the broth, and the zucchini and sausage go great together. Even my husband, who prefers more of a thick stew or chowder, had a second helping and enjoyed the leftovers! I used a mix of bowtie and fusilli pasta (what I had on hand), but other than that, followed the recipe exactly. Thanks for posting!

ITS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS AND PERFECT FOR A COLD RAINEY DAY.  MOST EVERYONE IS RIGHT THOUGH ABOUT REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF PASTA.  I SCALED THE RECIPE UP TO 12 PEOPLE AND USED ONLY 1 12OZ BOX OF FETTUCINE AND IT TURNED OUT JUST PERFECT.  I WILL MAKE THIS SOUP OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

This was terrific.  I served it for a dinner party.  It accompanied Italian Stuffed Chicken Breasts (which were stuffed with Mozzarella, sun-dried tomatoes, and ham), risotto, and bread.  Everyone commented on how delicious it is!  Try it, you'll like it.  I pre-cooked the sausage, then put everything into a slow-cooker on low/med setting.  I added Accini Di Pepe as the pasta during the last hour.  I cooked it a total of 6-8 hours.  Boy, did it smell great!

I used only shells, but next time will use orzo instead. I also used more stock and wine, and half a small can of tomato paste; which produced a much richer broth.

Although this is a good basic recipe, it just wasn't "finished" for me until I also added some mushrooms, beans, and chopped cabbage/chard/or spinach...  and, for ease of eating, changed the pasta to a spoon-size type (ie, small shells or elbows).

This soup was amazingly delicious!  I took a few tips from other reviewers and made a couple changes on my own (just because we like really flavorful food).  Most of the time when I make a recipe my husband and I find it to be bland, so I'm always trying to "kick it up" a notch.  We used 1 lb of sweet sausage and 1 lb of Hot!  We only used 1 zucchini but added 2 cups of chopped Kale (or spinach would be good too).  We doubled the basil and oregano and used 6 cloves of garlic (4 chopped and 2 grated) and 3 onions.  We also used 6 cups of beef broth (4 cups low sodium 2 cups regular) and 1.5 cups of Sutter Home cabernet.  I decided to skip the crock pot and do the whole thing in one pot!  So, I fried the sausage, removed it to a plate, sautéed the onion & garlic, added the rest of the ingredients and returned the sausage to the pot and let it simmer an hour & 1/2 and it was PERFECT!  We cooked the cheese tortellini separately and spooned the soup over it in our bowls and added the parmesan cheese!  So good!!!!  You just have to try it to believe it!

Delicioso!  I took some to my mother, who declared it was out of this world.  Very easy, and really good and filling.  Instead of spinach fettucine, I used cheese tortellini cooked separately and added to each bowl.  Oh, I'll be makin' this again!!  Thanks!

This soup is super easy and terrific.  I did change one thing, as I use tortellini instead of a thin noodle.  Next time the only other thing I will change is my family and I did not prefer the whole tomatoes as they didn't break down in the crock pot, next time I will use diced.  It was a wonderful soup, that would freeze very well, just add the pasta when ready to eat.  We did have quite a bit left over, I ate it all week for lunch and even the noodles stayed firm and did not get yucky.  High recommended!

This recipe sounds tasty, but somehow it became listed on this site as Gluten Free.  People who have had some experience with making GF meals will recognize that this is not the case, but just as a warning to amateurs, you will need to substitute special GF pasta to make this recipe safe for those with celiac disease.

this is our favorite soup. i have been asked to bring it to partys alot and always have been asked for the recipe. like many, i use tortellini instead of the suggested pasta and i also use fresh or frozen spinach instead of zuccini. spicy sausage is also wonderful. i usually make it in a big electric roaster and change the servings to "20" instead of serving eight and that is perfect for the roaster. this way, as a side, it serves a good fifty people. top with parmesan cheese

Hearty, tasty, satisfying soup.  Had to make a few changes because of our tastes. Omitted green pepper but sauteed some chopped leeks instead.  Also added some italian seasonings.  Didn't even add half the pasta called for, and, again that is personal taste.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This is a great soup!  I was out of beef broth and had to use chicken stock which i was worried about, but came out great!  I bet it is even better with beef broth or stock.  thanks for the great recipe!

Good stuff! I am thinking of cooking the noodles in the slow cooker next time, so that they will soak up the flavor of the soup.  It was yummy

Very good soup. I added a bit of Italian seasoning, a red pepper, and since I didn't have any spinach pasta, I added some frozen spinach.  The red wine really added to the soup.  My husband ate it up and he's pretty sure he hates spinach.  Thanks for this great recipe

Great recipe added a few of my own touches. 1 zucchini 1 half green and red bell pepper, some baby carrots, and a litle frozen spinach. I also added a little  red pepper flakes for a little kick. Almost forgot I also added a can of white beans.

What to say, what to say....I thought it was a 5 star, my husband thought it was 2 star, and my kids wouldn't eat it. What a shame, it was my favorite. I especially loved the  zucchini. Thank you for the recipe.

It's a good start but it wasn't great for me.  I guess it depends on the wine you put in also.  I used a cooking sherry, guess I could've bought a good drinking wine.  I needed to add some tomato paste to pep it up a bit. I also only used a mild italian sausage and used cheese tortellini.  It needs more liquid after adding the tortellini.  Next time I'll use a better wine and hotter italian sausage.

This soup was very tasty and my family enjoyed it.  I did not have time to cook the soup all day, so instead of using the crock pot, I cooked the veggies in the pot until soft - I used a bit more beef broth because I simmered it on the stove and it cooked down fairly quickly - from start to finish in about two and one-half hours.  We also used cheese tortellini instead of the spinach pasta.  Very hearty and warmed the soul on a cool fall evening.

Not bad! I used spicy italian sausage, which gave the soup a nice kick. Didn't have any red wine on hand, but I'm sure it adds even more flavor. Overall, not a bad dish!

Really good - I used cheese tortellini instead of the spinach pasta, as other reviewers recommended.  I also doubled the oregano and basil, and used canned diced tomatoes instead of canned whole.  It was so tasty and filling;  I had the leftovers without any pasta and it was still great.  My one-year old loved it, too.

Wonderful!!  My changes:  used mild italian sausage instead of sweet, doubled the basil and oregano, used only about 1/2 c wine (husband is not a wine lover), skipped the zucchini (didn't have any), added a red bell pepper in addition to the green one, used cheese tortellini instead of fettucine.  This was truly wonderful.  I served with a salad and garlic bread.

I used turkey Italian sausage and followed the advice of other reviewers by using cheese tortelini rather than spinach pasta.  Wonderfully fragrant and tasty.  Enjoyed by everyone.

Just as I expected - it was great.  Instead of the pasta the recipe suggested, i used cheese tortellini - very, very good.  Also added some sliced portabello mushrooms.  Will definitely be making this again.

This was so hearty, aromatic and rich in flavor! I made a few minor changes: used 1 C. white wine, one and a half rolls Jimmy Dean Italian sausage, heaping half t. of basil/oregano. Cooked it on the stove for 2 hours and during the last 15 minutes, put in cheese filled tortellini (Bertolli makes a small bag that serves 2-3 that was the perfect size). This is a keeper and I've already shared it with two other cooks I know. Thanks, Perri!!!

Delicious soup. Used hot Italian sausage and topped with shredded Parmesan cheese. Next time, i would dice the zucchini instead of slicing as the pieces were too big. Made this on the stovetop also instead of a crock pot. I cooked the onions, garlic and peppers with the sausage and didn't bother to drain. Also subbed bowtie pasta for the fettucine.

Yummy.... The only changes I made were that I added a box of fresh mushrooms & used half sweet & half hot sausage (doubling the amount called for).  I used mini cheese ravioli - cooked them separately (like the recipe SAID) and added them just before serving.  I took this to a neighborhood "soup party" and it was a hit!

This was incredible!  I omitted the wine and added extra broth, omitted the noodles and added celery and potatoes about 40 minutes before serving.  I just dumped all the ingredients, minus the potatoes, into a crock pot and walked away!  Delicious and even better the next day...a definite keeper.

I added 1/2 Cup Onions, 1/2 tsp Basil, 1/2 tsp italian seasoning, 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes, 1 beef bouillon 1/2 Cup of water. At the last 20 mins of cooking I added 1/2 Cup Orzo. This really spiced it up and gave it more hardiness. Not too much was left to this meal of a  soup. I served it with Corn Bread. Great meal on a cold day.

Very hearty, good flavor soup.  Don't like zucchini so I substituted a yellow pepper and mushrooms.  I like things spicy so I used spicy sausage.  next time, i'll use stewed tomatoes instead of whole.  all 6 guests loved it.

Very good, will make again.  I used frozen mixed vegetables in place of zucchini and added more water as it was very thick.  The mixed vegetables made it more like vegetable soup, but the Italian sausage gave it a different taste.

Just made this soup and it was a hit with the family....fairly easy to make.  I substituted tortelli with spinach and ricotta cheese instead of the fettucine and it was awesome!

We didn't like this one..threw out most of it.  I thought it had too many noodles but the taste wasn't what I was expecting.  Won't be making again.

This recipe is excellent. I didn't end up with very much broth, so I just added some water. I also used 8 oz. of noodles and added a little extra zucchini and italian sausage.

We love Italian Sausage, and this is a wonderful way to fix it.  I made it in the crock pot using half hot and half mild browned sausage and just served over spiral pasta. Did not have any zucchini on hand so used celery and carrots instead...and added a small can of sliced black olives.  It was delicious and will definitely make again.

an excellent, filling soup. the kids like it with garlic bread and the parmesan cheese sprinkled on top of the soup. we use hot italian sausage to make it spicier. should have fewer noodles and noodles should be cut to 1-2" lengths for easier spooning.

This soup came out very good. As for pasta, I used small shells and only about a third of a box. There appeared to be enough in the soup already to add any more pasta than that. If you want more pasta in the soup, I would suggest cutting back a little on the zucchini and maybe the pepper.

Really good!  We enjoyed every bit of it. I did substitute my Italian sausage (which is not that difficult to make). The worst part of it was smelling the aroma while it was cooking knowing that we had to wait until it was done. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

since it makes quite a lot when you're just cooking for one. I put 2/3 into the freezer. If you do the same, don't add the pasta/noodles until you reheat it. the noodles absorb the liquid and I ended up adding some broth. the cooked noodles can also be frozen. just take out what you need!

Very yummy! This soup has a great flavor and I think you can customize the vegetables to your liking very easy.  I added 8 ounces of mushrooms and red bell pepper instead of green.  I also only added 8 ounces of shell pasta, I didn't want too many carbs.  I also added a bag of fresh spinach half way through the cooking.  I don't like red wine in my food so just substituted more beef broth.  I will definately make this again!!!

I made a number of modifications, not b/c I thought the recipe was lacking, but for my own tastes: 1. Subbed all beef broth for the wine, 2. Subbed carrots for the zucchini, 3. Used only one can of crushed tomatoes, 4. Subbed an Italian seasoning blend for the spices, 4. Used a red, orange and green pepper instead of just the green pepper, and 5. Used ditalini pasta.  Lol, so, I guess the only thing I did per the recipe was the 1 1/2 sweet Italian sausage, garlic and the onion! But I did use it as a guide, which is what I do most often when using a recipe.  Thank you for the inspiration for a new staple soup in my repertoire! :)

Good recipe and makes a lot. 4 Stars because final product benefits from a fair amount of Parmesan Cheese (shredded not powdered) and a sprinkle of crushed red pepper flakes. Will make again.

Very tasty. I had no zucchini so I used kidney beans and also salad macaroni.  I like less meat so I browned the sausage, onion and garlic all at once stirring often-worked for me.  Even better the next day!

My husband and I love this recipe, but I did make a few changes.  I used turkey Italian sausage to cut the fat, and I replaced the zucchini and green pepper with one bunch of sautéed kale.  It's cooking on my stovetop right now.

This is a really good soup! I substituted the beef broth with vegetable and added fresh spinach and carrots. I also used dried parsley and bowtie noodles. I added the dry noodles during the last 20 minutes instead of cooking them first. It turned out great!

My husband & my 1 year old both loved it! I didn't have any bell peppers & I used marsala red wine & a little bit of vermouth. I would have like it better if it had been thicker, so next time I will thicken it with corn starch. I sauteed the onions & garlic before adding them, but everything else I put in the slow cooker raw. I also added some raw spinach leaves, since I didn't have spinach pasta, and we served it over plain fettuccine. I followed another users advice and added the zucchini almost at the very end so it wasn't soggy, and I added 6 small zucchini, would have added more had we had it. Will make this again.

Love this soup as did my husband.  He couldn't get enough of it.  I don't like whole tomatoes in soup so I substituted canned diced tomatoes for less chunkiness.  Still great.  Also yummy with cheese tortilini in place of spinach pasta.  Can't beat the ease of preparation.

All 8 of my family loved it, including the 3 and 5 year olds.  I added grated carrots and a package of spinach when I added the sauce for a little more vege.  I didn't have red wine so I used dry white.  It was still incredible!  In the last 30 minutes I threw in some ravioli's (it's what I had on hand) and it turned out wonderful.  On leftover day I added a bit of water to make up for the water the ravs soaked up. The ravs don't get as mushy as regular noodles and the kids love them.  Thanks so much!  This will be a favorite in our Italian household.

Great Dish! But I like mine a little spicy so I added hot italian sausage.

This was very good.  I used diced tomatoes and spinach penne, but next time I'll use elbows. The penne soaked 
up most of the broth. Will make again
soon.  Thanks!

This recipe is simply amazing. My husband loves it, and I even went home and made it for my parents and they couldn't get over how wonderful it was. It also smells delightful! I would suggest using stewed tomatoes instead of whole, and elbow pasta as others have said. This also makes wonderful leftovers!

What a great soup recipe! I freeze excess zucchini from my garden and then I have an ample supply to make this all winter long.
Thanks

This is an easy, hearty and fragrant soup that uses pantry staples and really makes coming home from work particularly special.   I used spicy Italian turkey sausage, added a couple tablespoons of tomato paste and, since we prefer chewier pasta at times, I used rigatoni instead of fettuccini.  I served it up with a green garden salad and crusty bread which made for a nice rustic meal.  Great work lunch leftovers as well!

I made a few small changes due to necessity (except the sausage, I prefer that for extra flavor and bite). I substituted hot Italian sausage for the sweet, 3 cheese tortellini instead of fettucine because I already had some that needed using, white wine I had onhand instead of the red, and cooked over 2 hours in a dutch oven as I forgot to start it early enough for the prescribed 4-6 hours in a slow cooker. I'm really happy with how ours came out though so next time around (and there definitely WILL be a next time!) I will repeat the way I made it this time. It was so tasty and such a big hit!

This was good but not amazing.  I served with warm tortellini to add to your soup at serving, and it did go over well.  However I thought it was a bit bland and too thin.  For a crock pot soup it was fine but I doubt I will make it again. Thanks.

Didn't change a thing with the ingredients, only thing I did differently was cook it all stove-top and let it simmer for an hour.  Was absolutely delicious.  Hearty and satisfying.

Excellent!  I didn't realize this was a slowcooker recipe, so I just simmered it on the stove for a couple hours.  I also used cheese filled tortalini and just added it to the soup 15-20 minutes before we were ready to eat.  Topped it with parmasean, it was DELISH!!!

This worked great in the slow cooker -- I work so I put it on low for 10 hours instead of high for 3 or 4 and it came out fine.  The only thing I didn't like was the fact that the noodles, while they were great when they first went into the soup, soaked up a lot more broth after sitting in it for an hour or two and ended up making a big pile of mush.  I kind of doubt I will have much success getting hubby to eat the leftovers.  However, the soup itself really tasted great.  I used homemade beef stock so I had to add quite a bit of salt and I also added a teaspoon or two of sugar just to sweeten the broth a tiny bit.

I rated 3 stars because it has some potential and I would make again with the following recommendations...crushed tomatoes instead of whole and less broth, it was too salty.

Awesome recipe! Will definately make it again. Pretty much followed the recipe exact, except rather than fettucine I used tri-colored rotini and instead of boiling it first I just added it directly to the crock pot with one hour to go in the cooking. Enjoyed it with a demi loaf of asiago sourdough!

I loved this soup! You can use any kind of pasta. I substituted water for 1/2 of the broth as I watch my sodium intake and did not have low-sodium broth in the pantry (husband shopped this week!).

This was very good! I altered the recipe as follows - left out zucchini and only used about half a green pepper. Couldn't find "sweet italian sausage" so took a gamble and used maple and it was fine.  Had home canned tomato juice instead of peeled tomatoes and used a jar of that instead. Per some other ratings only used half a container of pasta which was quite plenty and would advise another 2 cups of broth to help with the soaking up. this was good enough that my Grandma in Law complimented it with NO "add ins" of "needs salt" etc. :)I also added garlic and a little sugar.  We ate this with some home made yeast rolls and it was EXCELLENT. Thank you!! :)

I am not a big soup person, nor is my husband but I was feeling homey and wanted a comfort food on this cold day.  The soup turned out wonderful.  I added tortellini instead of the other pasta because I thought it complemented the sausage.  I also made sure to cook the tortellini completely so it didn't steal the moisture from the broth.

My mother in law was over for dinner and she too enjoyed it.

P.S. I didn't have any red wine so I skipped that and I think it tasted just fine.

I couldn't find spinach noodles (regardless of shape) anywhere so I subbed regular shell noodles. Good soup? Yes. Make again? Likely yes. Outstanding? No. I guess I just had too high of hopes and this recipe didn't deliver as much as i thought it would. It IS good, but I have tried a few that are better.  Sorry to be the oddball!

This soup was so easy to make.  There was a lot of noodles, but I added 1 1/2 cups of water to even it out.  Tastes like a soup you would get at a nice Italian restaurant.  Can't wait to serve it to friends and family!

I adapted this recipe a little and our family loved it.  I used hot italian sausage for half the amount called for, which spiced it up quite a bit.  After cooking the broth, wine, tomatoes, onions and garlic, I pureed it in the blender and then put it back in the pot.  It made my 12year old son, who said he wouldn't eat in when he saw the chunks of tomatoes and onion, decide to eat it.  He had seconds!  I also only used half of a 12oz. pkg. of the fettacine, and it was a good balance.  ~Sunnyvale Mom

The soup was delicious. However, it probably could have used more broth since once the pasta was added it was not much of a soup at all.

This is a great soup by itself, but when adding the spinach noodles, it becomes a "Main" course.
Great with hard rolls and very filling.

Nice base recipe for an Italian sausage soup.  I doctored this  a lot by adding carrot and summer squash, using diced tomatoes, and cut some calories by using spicy turkey sausage.  I prepared on the stovetop, and added about 6 oz cooked orrchetti pasta I needed to use up.  Yummy!  Makes a ton.  Served with balsamic tomato bruschetta.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

My family loved this soup! Pretty much all of the reviewers stated to use half of the noodles in the recipe, and the recipe creator even says the same thing in a review. Experiment with your favorite pastas...they all work. Just don't forget to add yummy cheese to top off your soup bowl!

It had no taste.  I had it for company with another soup and this one was just there.  Nothing to write home about.  I made it as directed and thought it would be terrific.  Sorry, I would not recommend this one.

The soup itself was very flavorful , I used an immersion mixer to add some body to the soup. I would use less pasta or something else, the pasta consumed too much of the soup. 
Very good recipe, you could add some other vegetables for a bigger verity.

I really liked this soup. The change I made was using diced tomatoes. Next time I would do as others have suggested,and put the pasta in just before serving.

Lovely soup.  I suggest  the following if you want the soup to taste slightly pizza-like.  Add 2T of fennel, Use 2T of oregano rather than 1/2t, Use half the zucchini, Use crushed tomatoes rather than whole peeled.  Additionally, if you like a zesty soup (I do) try using hot bulk italian sausage.  Spinach noodles do work great with this soup.  I used 1 ounce (dry weight) of noodles for each serving.

I made this and it was a hit. my son says he does not like soup.
Ha, he said this was great and wanted it for his lunch at work. My husband and I loved it as well. I don't like wine flavor, but just increased the broth. Like I said, it was a big hit. Thanks so much for a hearty, and flavorful meal. From the south, so of course we served with cornbread.

One of the reasons I made this soup was because I had all of the ingredients at home when I got the recipe online with two exceptions- zucchini and fresh parsley. So I doubled the green peppers, and used dried parsley at the end ( it rehydrates nicely) . I only used one pound of Italian sausage , 1/2 the pasta(I used shells and fusili as that is what I had on hand and they are bite sized unlike fettuccine) and 1/2 cup red wine as it was plenty for this recipe. I ended up making this in an enameled cast iron Dutch oven in about an hour instead of  a slow cooker as I didn't want to be eating dinner at 9 pm. I found the soup hearty and delicious and reheats very well in a microwave as I packed it to work every day for lunch for 5 days! One hint- cook the noodles for a couple minutes less than al dente as when adding them to the very hot soup they will continue to cook as the soup cools. I only wish I had fresh basil and oregano as dried doesn't soften well even after cooking. I found bits in my teeth later...

very good soup.  Cooked it on the stove for an hour.  Used chicken broth instead.  Replaced zucchini with a couple handfuls of fresh spinach at the end of cooking.  Also cooked white beans, and put that in the pot.  Will make again.

Thanks for posting.

The soup was fabulous! I made the mistake of following the recipe completely though. Soup was great until I added the spinach fettuccine. The noodles flavor was too over powering. Should have used vegetable noodles or just regular noodles. Should have relied on the picture :)

Made this tonight and followed the recipe exactly except I substituted three cheese tortellini as the pasta and added it to individual servings. The broth is so rich and delicious.  You could thicken it a little with potato flakes to make it more like a stew, but is awesome as is.  This is now a favorite!

OMG GOOD! I didn't have zucchini, but I threw in celery and carrots. I also added an extra cup of beef broth and reduced the wine by 1/4 cup (since that was all that was left in the bottle)  :). 
Also, I used Hot Italian turkey sausage to save on fat. I didn't add the noodles and they weren't missed. This soup is a meal unto itself. 
When my 16 and 17 y.o. sons asked me when I could make it again, that sealed the deal. This is great.

This was perfect! A huge hit with the girlfriend and I thought it was excellent. The zucchini was a great addition to it. I had 3rds when I rarely finish a plate at supper. The only thing we did different was added 3/4 cup of red wine instead of 1 1/4. Definitely going to be made for lots of dinners in the future. Yummmm.

I made this soup exactly as written, except we left the noodles out, and it turned out phenomenal! I made it a day in advance and let all the flavors blend overnight. Wow, my whole family said it was a winner. Honestly, we didn't intend on leaving out the pasta, but no one wanted to wait until they were done...ha. Soooo good!

This was a really great recipe to use as a base.  I took a lot of variation inspiration from naples34103's comment as well.  First I didn't cook it in a crockpot, but used a large 4-quart pot.  I started the broth and spices heating on medium high heat to get it started.  I used five fresh basil leaves rather than dried.  Instead of red wine, I substituted with a cup of dark grape juice.  As I completed prepping a vegetable off into the pot it went.  I started with the (thinly sliced) zucchini.  I added about twice as many tomatoes--which I had canned from my garden.  As they had been blanched and were whole, as they cooked down I would fish them out with a large drain spoon and slice them into quarters on my chopping block and then dump them back into the pot.  I also added Napa cabbage, fresh spinach, a couple green onions, and used Italian parsley.  I removed the casings from the sausage and used one pound sweet Italian and a half pound mild, mixing it together in a bowl and rolled into small balls.  After browning them on all sides in a skillet, I used my strainer spoon to fish them out and dump into my bowling pot.  I also browned 3 chicken legs and dumped them whole into the pot.  I used a combination of shell pasta and cheese tortellini, which was cooked separately and added to the pot after the soup had been cooking nearly an hour and a half+.  Shredded mozzarella was lightly added to the top before serving.

I have made this recipe twice now and it is wonderful! This time I dumped the entire box of pasta in directly which is a big mistake. This turns it into a pasta dish instead of a soup.  If you follow the directions, it is amazing.  I used gluten free pasta once and wheat pasta for the other.  Both were equally good.

This is a great recipe.It was even better the next day as others have mentioned. My husband and I actually liked it better without pasta. We used spicy Italian sausage and the heat seemed to really increase the next day. I used less wine and only 1 zucchini and a bit more broth as well. Would make this again and cut the sausage into smaller bite-size pieces. Also took the sausage out of casing which was a good call by another reviewer.

Delicious! I usually don't like much wine in my soups but since this was the first time trying recipe tried to follow recipe as close as possible. This reminds me of minestra or soup that I ate while living in the Italian Alps. Although there was much less meat in their soups. Meat is so expensive there. This soup is not Minestrone as one reviewer referred to but minestra with meat in it or a meat soup. I subbed a can of kidney beans for the pasta as I can't have carbs for right now and I used fresh basil, oregano and parsley from my garden and diced tomatoes instead of whole. Thanks, the broth of this soup is sooo good!

This was very tasty - family loved it.  I did use whole tomatoes but will switch to either diced or crushed next time as I had to cut up the whole tomatoes before serving.  Also, I used penne pasta and cooked it separately - 1 pound is a lot 1/2 pound is plenty.  I plated pasta and then added soup on top so the past didn't absorb all the soup.

Absolutely delicious.  I halved the recipe and there was still plenty for 3 people and leftovers.  I used a large can of crushed tomatoes with basil instead of the whole tomatoes and fresh basil instead of dried- just because I happened to have it on hand.  I also added about 3 large chopped carrots.  I used the spinach fettucini and didnt have the same issues with it that others mentioned (hard to get in spoon) because I broke it up before cooking.  Very, very tasty!

It was ok, edible.  I used a lot of pasta to diffuse all the flavours in the soup.  I doubt I would make it again.

My son really loved this dish.  I made some adjustments.  I  took the sausage out of the casings, then cooked it. I left out the green pepper.   Right before serving, I sprinkled some white cheddar cheese on top.

Yummy!  Brought to a church meeting and was well received.  My slow cooker is a poor cooker, so I cooked it for 10 hours on low, and added the pasta (had to substitute Ditalini, but it was good!) at the end.

Actually wasn't too bad, could have used a little more spice and I had to increase the salt intake to pull out the flavors.

mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.... My house smelled wonderful while this was cooking. This is a great recipe. I even messed up. I started cooking this and everything was fine until I got to the beef broth, i went to the cupboard and the cupboard was bare.  I used a can of chicken broth and the rest beef boulion cubes with water. I added a little whorchestershire sauce too. I will make again but next time with beef stock.

True to it's name. I've made this soup several times once for a family gathering everyone wanted the recipe. I did take the advise of others and used tortillni instead of the fettucini noodles. Everyone loves this soup a define keeper. Thank you.

What a great soup!  I made a half-recipe since there's only two here.  I used a little less fettucine than called for and some hot sausage, and we ate every bite.  Even leftovers were delicious.  Thanks!

Started this in my slow cooker before leaving for work.  When I got home, the house smelled like my favorite pizza!  The store was out of spinach fettucini, so I substituted fresh spinach-and-cheese tortellini.  I just dropped the tortellini into the slow cooker and let them cook in the broth.  Delicious, hearty recipe that makes a ton.  Will make again often, especially in the fall and winter!

YUM..thanks..I used half hot italian sausage and sweet for other half.gave it xtra zip..also used tortellini, but think any pasta would be fine.  Very hearty and filling with crusty bread.  I worried the wine would over power this..but it DID NOT and didn't even taste like wine..and I used a Cab Sauv!  A keeper for certain

I thought this was a great little soup. Very easy to make, very tasty, and the substitution of tortellini for the fettuccine made this soup hearty enough for a meal. My husband didn't like it, but then it contained three of his least favorite foods - onion, tomato, and zucchini. That just means more for me. :D My only other changes were the use of fresh herbs, turkey sausage instead of pork, and a can of crushed tomatoes instead of whole (I figure if I make the tomato pieces really small, my husband won't notice). Otherwise I followed the recipes exactly, and loved the results.

I really wasn't that impressed with this soup.  For the amount of time to prepare and cook, it really did not sell me.  I'm not sure if it was the red wine or the beef broth, but I felt as though the soup itself was just not terrific.  And because of the preparation time, it just isn't a sure winner for me.  I am glad I tried it though!

This soup is hearty and yummy. I simplified it by sauteing the onions and garlic right in the pan with the sausage. Saved a whole step. I couldn't get the fettucine so I did cheese tortelini as another reviewer suggested. Next time I will prbably just go for regular fettucine or no noodles at all. Delicious though.

I substituted the fettucine with colored, cheese-filled tortellini - this was an absolutely FANTASTIC recipe - I more than doubled the recipe and was still asked 'when can you make that again?"

The Best!!!! I was so impressed with this recipe. I didn't want to mess it up by using turkey sausage, so I went for the pork. It was fabulous!! This is defintily a keeper!

This is an excellent soup on a cold day.  I used diatilini pasta in mine, and omitted the zucchini.  I added some fresh mushrooms too.  You definitely need to add water to the recipe, but it doesn't lose any flavor.  I add water when heating it up for leftovers as well.

I made the soup and it has a great taste.  However, I'm like one of the other raters and wonder whether the sausage should be ground, whole or sliced.  I sliced my sausage but it gives the soup a curious texture.  Forego the noodles unless you want hash.

I didn't care for this recipe.  It was rather bland.  I cut back on the broth and wine and added a little spagetti sauce I had leftover.  Zucchini was left out because my husband didn't like it and I used turkey sausage to save on fat.  And to save time I didn't cook the sausage before hand and used dehydrated onions.  The fettucine is a poor choice.  You can't get any of the sauce.  Macaroni or gnocchi pasta would be a better choice.

Not a favorite, and perhaps just a matter of taste.  The recipe is a bit non-specific (are the sausages whole or sliced or taken out of casings, how are the onions to be cut, how about the whole peeled tomatoes?)  The pasta sucked up all the liquid and it turned into a very thick stew without a whole lot of flavor (I see the suggestions others had about using spicey sausage, which might improve on that).

Excellent hearty soup.  I used sausage and tri-color bow-tie pasta (cooked separately and added just at the end) and it was perfect.  Serve with warm Italian bread, parmesan cheese and you have a complete meal.

Not only is it easy to make but it is also very pretty to look at. This makes a great meal and when you add garlic bread to it, it can’t be beat. My sister-in-law is a very finicky eater yet she asked for a copy of this recipe. I will make this often.  Thanks

Although I thought that the taste was great, I followed the recipe exactly... I found that the fetucini noodle sucked up all the broth so I added another can of beef broth + a can of water...and it was still to thick, the fetucini noodles were kind of mushy, I think if I make this again I will substitute totillini noodles, or cook the spinach fetucini noodles in a separate pan first before adding.

This soup is WONDERFUL! I am trying different soup recipes alot and this one is fantastic as a meal with bread and a fresh fruit salad. I omitted the onion, garlic and canned whole, peeled tomatoes and simply substituted 2 cans diced tomatoes seasoned with basil, garlic, and oregano instead. I also used 1 1/2 lbs. three cheese tortelini instead of the fettucine pasta and added a few frozen mixed vegetables also. We ate leftovers the next night and found that there was not much juice left, but the flavor was still delicious! I plan on making this again for my "Souper Bowl" party next weekend.

This was a great tasting soup.  I added cans of beef broth without adding any water and it was too salty.  Next time I will add the water.  It was still great and everyone loved it though.  The zucchini was really good in it.

My husband and sons loved this soup.  Added Squash in addition to the zucchini for color.  Also add more broth and wine.  Also cut down on fettucine and broke it up.  Will make several times for family and quest.  Highly recommend

Very Good. Large quanity. I would 1/2 the recipe next time. I didn't have any fat to spare so I used butter to cook the onion and garlic. My Mother would love this. This is like a soup they would serve at a nice restaurant. Serve with toasted Garlic Bread.

Great soup!  Really flavourful, easy, and colourful.  I made several changes, because I didn't have everything at home.  I didn't have garlic.  I used cooking sherry, and only used 1/2 cup.  I used thyme instead of basil. I used only one zucchini and a small squash.  I used only a very small amount of noodles, and thought it was perfect.  I will definately make this again.  Thanks!

This soup was excellent.  I used shredded carrots in place of the zuchinni, and I just realized that I forgot to add the noodles.  It was great anyway though.  I threw everything in the crockpot, and it was done in the evening.  It got rave reviews from all.  I served it with french bread, and garlic spread submitted by Natalia.  It was a great meal.  We didn't even eat the salad because the soup and bread were enough to fill us all up.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I only used one onion, and increased the broth to 2 quarts because 1 pound of pasta soaked up all the liquid.  It had pretty good flavor, but was not my favorite.

My family loves this soup. They can't get enough and any leftovers are gone by the next day. I have added shredded cheese (Italian mix.) Just sprinkle over top of individual bowl allow it to melt a little & serve. I have changed the pasta almost every time I have made it  Instead of whole tomatoes I use 15oz can of tomato sauce. A little less wine (personal preference ) & more beef broth. I exchange dried minced onions for sm onions . We do not use the peppers and I add the zucchini closer to the end. I have cooked it in slow cooker & on stove. Warm rolls are a must. Thanks so much for recipe!!

The flavor is delicious!!! Made exactly as stated with the exception of a different soup pasta. To accommodate gluten free folks, it's JUST as good without the pasta added in.

The original recipe listed fettucine.  The photo shows shell pasta.  I followed the recipe and I would NOT use fettucine or spaghetti.  It is too hard to eat.  Use pasta as pictured.

I subbed carrots and celery for the other veggies to make it kid friendly and used leftover marinara sauce instead of opening a new can of tomatoes. Kids  loved it, man loved it, I loved it.
Also Zucchini in soup is  not my fave texture so that’s on me. . Oh, Also added more garlic but that’s just my go to. Yum!

Excellent soup.  Made it pretty much as the recipe says although I added diced carrots as it's always good to add more veggies.  I also used the entire small can of tomato paste just because I didn't want any leftover paste.  It was just fine.  I used spinach penne that we put the soup over at serving time.  My husband thought the noodles were a little large for soup, I thought they were just fine.  Next time we'll try serving over cheese tortellini's as others have suggested.  This is going to become one of my "go to" soup recipes.

Good soup.  Just not great!  I made it in a soup pot on the stove not in the crock pot.  Also I used shell quinoa pasta.  The next time I would use less red wine in the broth because the red wine was a little overpowering.  My family liked the sausage and I used a chicken italian sausage that was precooked so I just sliced the sausage into coins.  I will make it again.

This recipe was great, I did make a few changes to the ingredients and directions. The biggest was just to add carrots and replace the zucchini with a mix of spinach and arugula. I only used a pint of my own canned tomatoes instead of 2 cans of whole and about 1 1/2 extra cups of broth. I otherwise followed the basic ingredients. The hubs loved it and so did I.

I added red pepper instead of green pepper.  I think the ingredients should have less pepper, it seemed to take over the entire soup, I find this happens when using peppers.  This was not that good.

great recipe. I added 2 more cups of water and less pasta and let all cook together in same pot, I let it reduce for 1.5 hrs on stove (ran out of time) and 15 mins before serving added pasta and voila! All family loved it! it is a keeper!!!

This is a great soup on a cold day.  I cooked the meat, veggies and herbs together with the sausage in the pot on the stove and added the wine to let the alcohol cook out of it.  Opted to use spicy sausage, added mushrooms and red chile peppers for some heat.  Added in the broth and fettuccini noodles (dry) and let it meld together on the stove.  (I didn't want the wait time to be so long, as with a slow cooker.)   Turned out beautifully!

Great soup---almost a stew, with a few additions.  Add a can or two of white kidney beans (drained), two or three carrots, a couple of celery stalks---chopped kale is another great addition..  To solve the problem of the pasta absorbing the liquid---put the cooked pasta in the bowl and label hot soup over it.  I prefer to use cheese ravioli as the pasta.  Also to give it that stew-like consistency, add a couple of handfuls of instant mashed potato flakes---a little at a time and wait a minute or two before adding more.

This was great! Took advice from some others and added more liquid. Also added a portion of hot Italian sausage (next time I may go 50/50). I also added some red kidney beans. Substitued spinach for the zucchini. Used pesto tortellini for the pasta. Topped with some fresh basil and some parmesan and served with bread and salad. Great reviews from the whole family!

It turned out more like a stew than a soup and I even put less zucchini and a little less pasta and still not enough fluids.  This recipe was over rated.

Well, i guess I am an idiot - I misread the first ingredient....i assumed that this soup was made with sweet italian sausage - so that is what i bought!!  I decided to modify and make the soup anyway.  I grilled both sweet and hot italian sausage and set aside to cool.  I then cooked about a pound of ground sweet sausage and set aside to drain.  i added the rest of the ingredients (using a red pepper instead of a green pepper and diced tomatoes instead of peeled plum tomatoes).  i added everything to the crockpot and let it cook - Incredible!

This is a wonderfully rich and savory soup. I needed to make it after work ( sans the slow cooker) so I changed it up by sauteing the onions until just translucent and then adding the pepper ( i used a red bell) and garlic. After that I added the remaining ingredients and brought it to a boil and then turned it back to simmer for an hour. ( Oh, I did reduce the wine by 1/2 cup) I partially cooked the pasta (I used tricolor radiatore) but next time I will add it to the simmering soup until it's done. This soup was even yummier by the second day!!

Really nice combination of flavors. I forgot to buy the spinach noodles, so I added some fresh spinach along with ditalini and it seemed to work. I'll definitely try again - some white beans might be good in this recipe too!

When my husband came home from work he said the aroma from the soup made the house smell so good. He loved it and so did I. I will definitely have to try this dish again, real soon. ????

Great soup!  I'll be making it again.  But a couple heads up...one, good luck finding spinach  fettuccine.  The only one I found was organic and only came in a 8oz box.  Super expensive, too.  AND, if you decide to double this recipe then you better have a HUGE pot! :)  I just made it 50% bigger, and it then didn't fit into my large crackpot.  I had to get my huge pot out and baby sit it all day.  Still, great soup!

This is delicious. Next time, I may use hot Italian sausage, and kidney beans instead of pasta. My sausage didn't make much grease, so I did not drain. Just added garlic and onion to the sausage to saute after browning/crumbling. And added it and everything else to Crockpot.

Amazing!  Easy! We added white beans and spinach leaves for additional veggies.  Did not use wine.  Followed seasoning directions exactly and flavor was robust and soup was hearty. Will make again and again!

This a great easy recipe. I bought a package of sausage that was only 1 pound so I added mushrooms to give more substance to the soup. This was a very good addition. I noticed in the picture that  a different type of noodle was used- I used a short curved pasta that really held  & captured this hearty soup.

This is my favorite soup it’s not difficult to make it tastes so so so so good and cleanup isn’t hard at all. The only thing I change is I add more liquid because the vegetables soak up a lot and it becomes less of a soup texture.

I followed the instructions perfectly. The soup was horrible. I spent to much making it and will have to eat it. I have a much better Italian sausage soup receipt but cant advertise it because it is not my personnel creation.

Fettucine noodles are not the best choice here.  Use something small that fits on a spoon.  Also, use less pasta or it gets crowded and is more like a stew.  Flavor is good.  And next time, I might even go with two pounds of sausage.  I like it a little meatier.

This is the first recipe that I didn't alter (Except the noodles) just scaled back because there are only 3 people in my family.
Even my husband liked it and he doesn't like anything!
I used frozen Johnsonville  Italian style meatballs about 18. 
1 28 oz can whole tomatoes,
1 box beef broth 32oz,
1  smallish Zucchini, 
1/2 green pepper (chopped fine so my husband didn't know)
and about 3/4 box shell noodles.
topped with a little fresh shredded Parmesan
and served with a loaf of fresh Italian bread.
I did have to add more broth to the left overs the next day.

This had really good flavor to it. The only thing I would do different for next time though, is add less noodles. I added too many and they kind of soaked up the delicious broth. You could make this without noodles, but I don't think my kids would have liked it as much as they did.

I really enjoyed this dish!  I returned from 3 weeks in Italy, visiting many cities and villages mainly focused on food and culture.  One thing I learned about Italian cooking is the importance of fresh wholesome ingredients.   I used imported Cento San Marzano Tomatoes, De Cecco Pasta Shells, LeCrema Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir,  1/2 cup of fresh chopped basil instead of dried, and two tablespoons or fresh oregano.  I finished the dish with a sprinkle of lemon and a generous heaping of grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese.

We loved it but made some changes. Substituted diced tomatoes  Also used less wine  and put everything in the crockpot.. Cooked sausage and little meatballs and put them in last hour of cooking time. Also added fresh spinach last 15 minutes of cooking. Used  ditalini pasta which was cooked up separately and put into bowls before serving.  Excellent soup!!!

This was delicious and I didn't use all of the ingredients. I only had 4 cups of beef brother so I actually added 2 cups of veggie broth. Also I didn't have any wine which I missed, but the recipe didn't. Also, I used shells instead of fettuccini. My kids and husband raved about it being delicious! I will try wine next time with it, but I don't think it needed it.

Great soup to assemble for the crock pot, I've made several times and use different types of pasta.  Might try it with hot sausage for a variation.

Great basic recipe. Don't be afraid to use less wine, white wine, chicken broth, acorn squash, etc. Since we eat Paleo-style, we leave out the pasta. Good spot to add chopped kale, too. Sometimes we find spinach and kale together in a large bag and just toss them both in. Best to chop them finer to avoid green strings on your chin! Mangiare e godere! (Eat and enjoy!)

I always look at reviews and suggestions prior to recreating a recipe on here.  Based on the reviews, I made a couple of changes that were probably not necessary.  I added extra sausage (because we like Italian sausage) and removed the casings.  I added some red bell pepper since I had some that needed to be used, one zucchini, chopped fresh tomatoes from my garden, and fresh baby spinach.  I, too, substituted the pasta for a bag of mixed shells and cooked the pasta separately.  The family requested Farfalle or fettuccine for the next time around.  I will be making this again!

I was time to clean out the freezer before we head north for the summer and I had enough Italian sausage to make this yummy soup.  The recipe does make a lot but I froze half and will serve on a night when I'm sick of packing.  Serve with a buttered roll, it is the best !

We LOVE soups!  Happy that a cool front is coming so that I could make this.  Still simmering, but tastes fabulous so far.  I also chopped up some mushrooms in the soup, and added some crushed red pepper.  Can't wait to dish it up!  Thanks for sharing!

This was delicious! I could not stop eating it. The only things I did different were, took the sausage out of the casings, used 1/2 tsp Italian seasoning in place of the oregano because I did not have any, and cooked it on the stovetop because I did not have time to do the slow cooker. Will definitely make this again.

Yum!

Left out the wine and parsley, used spicy italian sausage rather than sweet.  Cooked it on the stove top at low/medium for about four hours.  Also used mini shell pasta rather than fettuccine. Really delicious... I had my doubts about soup with sausage. I am not a big sausage fan. Also added a bit more of the spices, and some sea salt right before serving. Highly recommend this one.

Great tasting soup, I used orzo for the pasta and added some fresh string beans and peas, for a different taste I added 2 cups of chopped kale.  I chose not to use the tomatoes, but added a touch of tubed tomato, really did the job, tried to lessen the sodium content.  At the end added some shaved Grande-Panada cheese in each bowl along with a few sprinkles of fresh parsley.  Ciao1@embarqmail.com

I feed a family of 7 every night and this went fast! I used hot Italian sausage, but didn't change anything else. Thick like a stew and very filling. I will definitely put this in my dinner rotation. It's a keeper! Thanks for the recipe.

I used Sweet Italian Chicken sausage with chicken broth and white wine and then added some Frank's Hot Sauce to spice it up and it was really good.   Next time I will use hot Italian Chicken Sausage, which will make it perfect for my tastes!   Great recipe.

Yes, indeed, it is the best!  Minor alterations- a bit more sausage (combo sweet and hot), diced tomatoes, different pasta (added individually to each serving).

I'm planning on making this.But it sounds so good that I'll give it 4 stars.  I do agree with others that it appears as if the photo is showing elbow macaroni not spinach fettuccine (which is what I would use anyway not the fettuccine).  To Lap39, maybe she should read the ingredients, as yes, it does list to put in 2 Zucchini.  Don't leave a review if you can't read.

5 stars with 1 exception, use Ditalini instead of fettucini, it's what make s Minestrone so good and does wonders for this or any soup.

Since I have to watch my carbs, I subtracted half the pasta, and added more veggies -- fresh green beans, broccoli and brussel sprouts. Still good and much healthier. I also used spicy sausage and extra onion and garlic.

Amazing... Not a thing I would change about this recipe. 

Used Francis Coppola 2012 Black Label Claret for the wine, and it really enhanced the flavoring

Good flavor overall, but I don't think it would be wise to add 16oz of noodles if you want any broth.

Excellent! I doubled the garlic, used penne pasta, and lowered the wine to about 3/4 cup as others suggested.  I also used a chicken susage, so I had to saute in olive oil.  I threw in a couple hand fulls of spinach at the end.  I also sprinkled some shredded mozzarella and parmesan in each bowl and served with crusty buttered bread.  It was delicious!

Will definitely make again.  The slow cooker I used was too small for all the broth, so I eliminated the pasta.  It was still wonderful!

This was an absolutely amazing soup recipe.  I have shared it with many already.  I used Wacky Mac shaped pastas instead of the fettucine-that's the only change.  It was wonderful the next day as well.  Thanks so much!

This was good when I was looking for something different.  I used cheese-filled tortellini instead of fettuccini.  The only thing was that it took time to cut up everything and throw it in.

I did not like this soup at all. I did it exactly as the recipe instructed, and the whole thing tasted overwhelmingly like red wine. Bleh. After i ate half a bowl, i drained all of the broth from the whole pot and replaced it with straight beef broth. Now it pretty much tastes like nothing, but it's better than what it was. IMHO, there's a far better recipe on this site for Italian Sausage Soup that i wouldn't hesitate to make again.

Serve with bread and it is a one pot dinner!  Very hearty, yummy soup.  As squash is out of season, I used carrots per previous reviewer.  I will cook this often.

I thought the soup was quite good, except I thought it had too much pasta and I only used 12 oz. instead of the 16.  I will probably make again.
