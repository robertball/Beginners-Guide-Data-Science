I found this recipe to be written up poorly. I followed it word for word and it didn't turn out. My mother was Sicilian and made these cakes all the time and they were wonderful. This one was a mess. I probably won't waste the money on ingrediants to try this one again. Sorry.

I came across this recipe almost seven years ago on this website and have been making it each Christmas ever since. I always omit the candied fruit (although this is traditional) to suit the tastes of my family. The cake is very good and is requested by my Sicilian parents every year.I have omitted the almonds on occasion, however we enjoy both versions. Give it a try!

Very nice dessert for a special occasion.  It can be made a day or two ahead of serving and kept in the refrigerator.   I have made the frosting with rum, as in this version, or with chocolate and espresso coffee.   As Caterina pointed out in her review some years ago, you can change the additions to the filling to suit your tastes.   Thank you for the recipe, Traci.
