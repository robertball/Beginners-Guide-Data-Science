Made my own alfredo and used frozen spinach well squeezed. I opted out of the tomatoes. This was cheesy and def. could be cut back if you are watching your fat content or just don't want it too cheesy. I also added some fresh cut up turkey for a one stop meal. Served over Whole Wheat Pasta it was a good meal and tasted delicious. This really could be used as a dip also, actually I tried it with a matzo cracker and it was wonderful.

This turned out perfect for me! I turned it into a spinach dip chicken pasta main dish. Will be making this at least once a month from now on! :)

I added chicken cut in cubes and sauteed adding the garlic for the last few minutes before adding all the sauce ingredients to pan.  Served it over gnocchi.  So good!  I used frozen spinach drained well, and after running that in food processor put in the artichoke hearts for a few turns rather than chopping by hand, which worked well.  Definitely oooey gooey and probably really fattening, but hey, you've gotta live.  Used low fat cream cheese and probably will try with low fat versions of other cheeses next time, but there will definitely be a next time!

Using the entire can is way too much spinach. I'd only use that much if you want spinach sauce. It doesn't taste like any of the other ingredients. Maybe 1/2 the can, or less is better.
