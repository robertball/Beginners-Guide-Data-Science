Oh yum Liane! We really loved these. I scaled the recipe down to six and used ground turkey. Altho the meatballs would make a really nice appy, which I will certainly do in the future, I made them for dinner and served them over mashed potatoes. I followed the recipe, however, next time I won't waste my vodka as I didn't think it added anything to the dish. Thanks so much!

I made these for a family reunion.  I boiled the meatballs instead of frying them. It makes them less greasy, is easier to do and they hold their shape better.  I put them in a crock pot, put the sauce over and cooked on low for 3 hours. Very yummy and I got rave reviews.

I made this for my party and there was not a meatball left in the house! I only used one can of crushed tomatoes (two wouldnt fit in the pot) I made sauce first then added large 6lb bag of frozen meatballs from Costco and cooked on high for 4-5 hours then turned down to warm for the rest of the night.This will be my "dish" when invited to parties

This was a very tasty dish, although I prefer to substitute a cup and a half of uncooked rice for the bread crumbs. It's excellent served with baked beans and corn on the cob.

Really good and very easy!  I used all turkey and omitted all of the vodka from the recipe.  I also used all fresh tomatoes from my garden (instead of the canned) and cooked them together with all of the other sauce ingredients.  Also, baked the meatballs in a 400 degree oven for about 40 minutes (while making the sauce)... I put them in a crock pot and poured only half of the sauce over the meatballs.  I froze the other half of the sauce to use later.

I have used this recipe at least 10 times now! WONDERFUL meatballs!   I actually use frozen meatballs, but I prepare the sauce as written (except I have usually left out the vodka) and then throw everything in a crock pot. It is sooooo good! I use Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce - our personal fave - amazing! I've also had good luck with KC's.  YUM!   I can only imagine how much better this is with the homemade meatballs! Someday I will try!   I've also thrown Little Smokies/Mini Hot Dogs in the sauce.   Sometimes I will just let the sauce cook first in the crock pot, and add the meatballs after awhile. They usually heat up pretty well, and this keeps 'em from getting soggy.  THANKS for the recipe!

I made these meatballs for a potluck at work and have been hailed the meatball queen.  I did make a couple small alterations due to ingredients I had on hand.  I used ground pork instead of turkey, a 28-oz bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's and omitted the vodka and crushed tomatoes.  I made the meatballs and sauce the night before then cooked them in the crock pot on low for about 2.5 hours at work the next morning.  They turned out fabulous!  I'm sure the original recipe would be just as good.  All my coworkers have said that I must bring these meatballs to all future potlucks.

At first I didn't think this recipe was that good.  Though I think part of my impression was because of the bad choice in trying to pair it with cooked linguine.  I intentionally made the full yield in order to have left overs.  I didn't have an issue with them not cooking through enough.  As the sauce was simmering, I used a large skillet and browned the meatballs in small batches before adding them to the pot with the sauce.  They cooked through while the sauce simmered for about an hour.  Reheating them and serving them alone I realize that they are quite tasty.  I agree with one of the other reviewers that these would make great meatball subs.  Though I didn't initially like them, my family did.  And I've since served some of the left over meatballs and gotten many compliments.  These do take a while to make, but they are worth it.  Something that might help cut down on prep time is to have a few volunteers with you to form the meatballs.  This might go without saying, though I've learned the hard way that you need to be careful when you are simmering the sauce so that it doesn't become burnt on the bottom of the pot.  A splatter screen is a good idea too.  Thanks Liane!

I've made these meatballs many times for parties and always get rave reviews.  I make them every year for our New Years Eve party and there is never a single meatball left.  The only thing that I change is that I use ground pork instead of ground beef because I don't eat beef.  Delicious!

This was a great recipe.  I altered it a little and used bround turkey and sausage finely cut.  I also left out the vodka. My family loved this and I will be making it agan!

This recipe was exellent! I left out the pineapple (I'm allergic) but they were still wonderful. I'm used to a sweet BBQ sauce, but this tangy BBQ sauce was wonderful. The turkey with the beef made a less fattening and still delicious meatball.

Didn't try the meatballs, but I did make this sauce for use with frozen meatballs.  Heads up everyone, it makes ALOT.  The sauce was delicious, but I prefer my bbq sauces to be a bit more smokey and definitely less tomato.  Thanks for the basic recipe, I look forward to altering it to my preference next time around.

These meatballs are delicious. I dislike frying things (too time consuming) so I cooked the meatballs with the sauce on the stove. Only thing I would

A mild flavored bbq sauce. I made the meatballs and they were nothing special. Next time  I make this dish I will use premade meatballs.

We really liked these meatballs!  I did make a couple of small changes.  Because I cut the recipe to 8 servings, I used only one package of Jennie-O ground turkey breast (1 1/4 lb), and I didn't add water but rather pineapple juice.  I also sprinkled in a little Tajin (a new favorite seasoning).  For the sauce I used a 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes, no puree, Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce, no brown sugar (because of the BBQ sauce), and only a big squirt of catsup.  I didn't have pineapple but used pineapple juice instead.  I browned the one-ounce meatballs in a tablespoon of butter and a tablespoon of olive oil before adding them to finish cooking in the sauce.  This is a really nice recipe that I will definitely make again!  I have enough left over for another meal for the two of us, and we will look forward to this!  Thank you so much for this recipe!

we didn't love this.. General consensus was tasted in between a marinara and bbq sauce and most would have preferred one or the other. personally, too much ketchup taste for me. the meatballs themselves weren't bad

Tight on time-bought the meatballs.
The sauce was so incredible that I saved the leftovers (which was a lot) and slathered it over the rotisserie chicken the next day!  Delicious!!!
