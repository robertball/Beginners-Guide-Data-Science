I love this recipe! I don't like frying anything, so this was perfect. I used panko bread crumbs and seasoned them with salt and pepper and powdered garlic. I followed the milk, flour, milk, panko crumbs sequence in the original recipe. The crust was light and flakey and the fish was very tender and nothing was at all soggy. I made a avocado and jalapeno tartar sauce.
Yummy!

I made one change in this recipe, that was to dip the fish first in flour then the milk before dipping into the crouton crumbs, the breading stayed on and didn't have a mushy texture as the other reviewer stated. My daughter normally picks off breading but loved this one so it is a keeper. Next time I may try tweaking it a little just to see what I can come up with. Thanks for the recipe!

You will never deep fry again.....didn't read the directions too good and mixed the flour with the bread crumbs.  It was great, dipped in milk, added desired seasoning then dipped in flour, crumb mixture.  the last step of spraying on the cooking spray makes it come out like fried.  Used fresh catfish but any fish would be good.....

I really liked this recipe!  I skipped the first milk-dunk and started with salt and pepper, then flour, then milk, then breadcrumbs.  I had some pretty thick filets, so I baked them for 15 minutes.  The breading was PERFECT.  It got crispy and stayed intact.

I also skipped the first dipping in milk, seasoned the flour with salt and pepper, and cooked on parchment paper and found it was lovely and crispy. Yummy!

I am always looking for alternatives to fried.  We've done the baked thing to the point we don't like it anymore, but this recipe gave me some ideas.  I also did the flour, milk and crumb sequence using crushed cheesits instead of bread crumbs.  Really spiced up the flavors and the crunch was fantastic.  Being easy to do didn't hurt either. :o)

Fantastic, although I took some huge liberties with the recipe. to the flour i added 1/4 (just under) instant mashed potato flakes-i had seen them used in another fish recipe. i seasoned this mix with dill, italian seasoning and paprika. The coating i had croutons, but not enough, so i added the rest of a box of cheez-its to the croutons. still a little shy for coating i added a little crisp rice cereal. About two minutes before i took them out of the oven i sprinkled with fried onions. A winner! Great coating. mine did cook a bit longer then ten minutes, but they were still a little frozen. We should be eating more fish now that i have such an easy way to prepare it.

This was awesome!  So easy and tasty!  I used tilapia and homemade croutons.  I couldn't believe how tasty and cruchy this was.  My new favorite way to eat fish, plus it is way healthier than deep frying!  I paired this with homemade tarter sauce - (1 cup fat free mayo, 1 bread and butter stacker pickle finlely chopped(the thinly sliced ones),  1/2 teaspoon chopped garlic, 1/4 teaspoon dried dill, 1/2 teaspoon onion powder, 1 Tablespoon lemon juice, sprinkle of dried parsley, 1/4 tsp salt and add pepper to taste).  Such a good meal with steamed broccoli and carrots.  YuM!

Made this recipe with nice, thick cod loins.  Put a little bit of olive oil on the bottom of a glass pan, and then mopped up most of it with a paper towel. Instead of the milk, I dipped the cod loins in egg and then in organic bread crumbs, and baked at 450 degrees for about 20 minutes.  These were just like the fish you get when you are eating the "fried fish " from fish and chips fame, but without all the extra fat! Delicious!!! Will make this again and again!!!

This is a good recipe, but need to add some seasoning to the flour.  Make sure to shake off the access flour.  I think I drizzle with garlic butter next time.  Thanks!

This was good, filling, and in my opinion average +. I do not have access to the croutons required for the recipe, so I used bread crumbs seasoned with onion and garlic powder, and some dried mustard. Served with mashed potatoes and a green salad. Kids did not care for the fish (only 1 of 4 finished their fish) but my husband enjoyed it.

Made this with flounder filets last night, and really liked it.  I like crispy breading, but prefer not to fry, and hadn't found an oven-baked recipe that did it.  This recipe worked.  I think the trick is spraying with vegetable oil.  Again, I'd prefer not to use the oil, so I only sprayed 2 out of the 3 filets to see the difference.  And the ones that were sprayed did in fact come out crispier than the non-sprayed one.  The non-sprayed one was still tasty, it just didn't have quite the same crunch.  I dredged in flour, then dipped in milk, and finally coated in a mix of seasoned panko crumbs (75%) and Italian bread crumbs (25%).

Oh my gosh....great recipe taste like fish sticks. The only changes I made was I put fish in bowl, poured milk over the fish and seasoned.  I combined flour, croutons and added 4 tablespoons of bread crumbs in a ziplock bag. Added fish to the ziplock bag.

totally liked this recipe. The only think I find that was difficult was the crushing of the croutons. So I just threw the croutons into my ninja chopper and pulsed a few times. I also used tilapia fresh from the market. It was the best looking selection of white fish available at the time. Sliced the portions in half and followed the recipe the rest of the way. I'm not sure what the point of spraying the fish with cooking spray after they were coated but I did any way. My fish took about 20 minutes in the oven on the thicker pieces. And my family loved the fish done this way. So if your out of bread crumbs and needed something to coat with...croutons is totally a great option to have on any recipe. TY this was nice.

I like the concept of using the croutons as a coating on the fish, I gave it a bit more flavour by adding in some parmesan cheese.

I skipped the first milk dunk and used Panko bread crumbs instead of croutons (that's all I had on hand) and they turned out super crispy and delicious.  The simplicity of it all helped A LOT!!  Great recipe!

I had to make this gluten and dairy free so....  
I used Bob's Red Mill All Purpose Gluten Free flour, Glutino bread crumbs (maybe 1 cups worth) and added about 1/4 cup of corn meal to the bread crumbs.  I seasoned the crumb/corn meal mixture with about 2 Tbsp porterhouse seasoning (yeah, I know...this is fish but this seasoning is good on everything) and used plain, unsweetened almond milk for dipping.  I dipped in the flour then the almond milk and then the cornmeal mixture and placed on baking pan sprayed with olive oil then sprayed the fillets with olive oil.  Baked for 15 minutes - perfect!  Satisfied the desire for fried fish just fine!  My GF kiddo ate two pieces!

My husband is hard to please and my daughter usually don't eat fish but they both loved this.  It turned out crispy and flavorable.  I did add zataran flour mix seasoning instead of flour, garlic salt & a drop of mustard for added taste & it was delicious.  A staple, a keeper.

These were very good. I didn't bother looking at the measurements and also used breadcrumbs w/salt and pepper for the coating. I didn't bother dipping in milk first, just skipped that and dipped in flour, milk, then breadcrumbs. After they were done baking I flipped them over and put a tiny pat of butter on each one and stuck it back in the oven for a couple minutes for it to melt. Yum Yum! This would also work great with cornmeal I think.

Could have been better...but TOTALLY my fault! I did not have Italian croutons, had to use Ritz crackers. Big mistake. Fish was too soft on inside, not crispy outside. Will definitely try again. Great alternative to frying!

My family loves this even more than fried fish!  It's nice and crispy and has great flavor!  I substituted corn meal instead of the flour and we liked that even more.

This was a good solid recipe :) breading wasn't really crispy but also wasn't even close to soggy. i added some cajun seasoning to the flour and also to the tops of the fish before baking...awesome :)

I was looking for a way to oven fry some cod that I had and this was suggested when I inquired about a recipe on the Recipe Buzz.  I followed the recipe/method with one exception......I used some panko bread crumbs which I seasoned instead of the croutons.  DH and I both enjoyed this very much and it will definitely be made again in this house.

Made this gluten/wheat/lactose-free and it was wonderful! I used catfish fillets, buckwheat flour, lactose-free milk, and cornflake crumbs. I'll make this again! Sprinkled with lemon juice upon serving. YuM!

This fish was pretty good, but not the best I've had. I used Cheese and Garlic croutons (that's all I had) and  they gave a good flavor, but it just wasn't strong enough. My family said it was okay, but asked me to make Mrs7up's Parmesan Puffed Tilapia instead, next time I make fish :) I also found that 2 cups of croutons made too many crumbs for four 4oz. fillets of fish...I probably used more like 1 1/2 cups. The one really nice thing about this recipe is that it is super easy and quick to make...it was ready in 20 minutes, or maybe even less. Thanks for sharing the recipe...it was good!

This is a good dish. I mis-read the recipe and bought whiting. I added some glazed roasted pecans and almonds to the croutons, which added a sweet, earthy flavor. Others had dipped in milk first then flour but when I did it this way the croutons wouldn't adhere. Will make again.

This was so good! I used cod for this and had no trouble with the coating being mushy but that may be because I dipped my fish into egg substitute instead of the milk. Very nice and served it with a horseradish sauce on this site. Thank you!

I'm giving it 4 stars because it never got really crispy.  In fact, the bottoms were a little soggy.  I used Mahi Mahi, milk dunk, flour seasoned with Tony Charere's, milk dunk and  seasoned italian bread crumbs.   I think if I make it again, I will flip the fish over so it gets crispiER on both sides.   All in all, it was good.

A very good recipe & a much healthier way to prepare fish and still have a crispy coating.  I didn't have seasoned croutons, so I used Panko crumbs and added the following to both the crumbs & the flour: Gourmet Italian seasoning, garlic powder, parsley & a small amount of seasoning salt.  I used non-stick foil to cover my baking sheet to skip the 1st step of spraying, but I did spray the fish before it went into the oven. It was perfect after 10 minutes & didn't stick to the foil.  All in all, an excellent dish that I'll be using again and again!

I didn't change a thing other than using some fresh snapper that I caught. I made it just the way it said on the recipe. Don't skip spraying the coated fish with vegetable spray. I used olive oil spray. It came excellent. Crispy, flaky crust and tender inside. I served it to 7 adults (2 of which said they don't like fish) and 1 child. Everyone loved it. This is definitely a keeper, I will make it again. Much easier and healthier than frying.

Easy and tasty. I used Italian style breadcrumbs instead of croutons and added salt and pepper to the flour and skipped the first milk dip.

I am not sure why our family had such a differing opinion on this recipe, but only 1 in 5 liked it.  We won't be making this again.  I guess we are just too used to fried fish.

Very good!  I used Halibut, and cut it into fish sticks, since I have 3 young kids.  I was hesitant if they would eat it (twin 1.5 yo, and 4 yo), and they ate it right up, no problem!  Such a healthier replacement to the frozen fish sticks!  I used a ranch crouton (make sure you crush it very finely) - choose whatever you want, that is what will give the fish flavor!  SO good, will make again - easy too! Thanks!

I used Catfish fillets and cut them in half.  NO WAY they were cooked in 10 minutes.  Pulled them out, put right back in for another 8 minutes.  Taste was good, instruction off if you have anything but a super thin cut of fish.

Very good...great alternative to 'frying' and so much healthier!  I used panko crumbs and seasoned my flour with some Louisiana style seasoning...starting by dipping in the flour, then milk and then panko.  Used both tilapia and ocean perch, we really enjoyed this and will make again!

I toasted panko crumbs first and mixed in thyme, basil and oregano.  I also skipped the first milk dunking and did flour and garlic salt first, then milk, then panko crumbs.

I don't know if it was because I used scrod that might have been too thick or if it needed more seasoning, but this was a bit boring.  Also, the 10 minutes were too short.

I didn't like this. The flour and milk combo made the fish have a gummy, pasty coating. There definitely should've been some salt, pepper, or any seasoning put on the fish before breading. This was bland and was even worse as leftovers. I won't be making this one again.

I thought it was good but I'll need to some tweaking. The fish was good but it didn't come out like the pictures. Most likely it was me lol. Does anyone know how to prevent the fish from having a powdery top? It's not that it isn't cooked but, whenever I bake food like that the top is always white.

This is so easy and so good! I used fillet of sole that I had previously individually frozen; I dipped/coated them in their frozen state. Being thin, they defrosted by the time they went into the oven. This same method works with any dry bread crumb, but crushed croutons do add a nice flavor. My Indiana fish-fry-lovin' Hubby thought I had fried these little guys.

This was easy and very good.  I seasoned the fish with creole seasoning and instead of plain flour, I used fish fry breading.  It was fabulous.

This was delicious. I used my own seasoned bread crumbs, and needed far less than the 2 cups stated in the recipe. The amounts of milk and flour were right on, though. My husband had two fillets, and was very pleased with them. My fillets were a bit thick, so I baked them for 5 minutes - they were crispy but juicy. The recipe is both easy and tasty - my kind of recipe!

Very good light healthy fish. Added cayenne salt & pepper to flour. Used panko Italian bread crumbs. Used olive oil instead of spray. Drizzled top of fish with olive oil. Big hit with husband.

We used flounder for this recipes and cut it into fish stick size portions.  The cooking time for ours was perfect.  Both my husband and 4 year old enjoyed this.  It was my four year old's first time having any kind of fish so we will definitely make this again...  Probably as fish sticks again....

Wow!  This was a great recipe!  I made it last night because I didn't feel like frying anything! LOL  The only thing I changed was instead of using croutons, I mashed up some Ritz crackers and pretzel sticks.  They made for an awesome coating!  This is a definite keeper!

Delicious!  When I make it again I'm going to make sure I crush up the croutons more.

Husband and I and the 2-y.o. all loved this. I also used the milk > flour > crumbs process (omitting the first milk dunking) with frozen cod thawed quickly in lukewarm water and cut into fishstick strips, and they turned out great.

I made this for a quick meal last night.  I used cod fillets and cut them into nice chunks.  I only did the dipping of milk once (after the flour), I also seasoned the flour like others had said.  I had herbed stuffing on hand, so that is what I used.  I couldn't believe how crispy and yummy these turned out.  Next time I am going to try a different stuffing mix flavor, just to see.  This was a great quick meal!

Cornmeal is a must in the south. So I used Masa corn meal, Old Bay seasoning and salt pepper. I soaked the fish in in heavy cream until I was ready. I don't believe in those processed "healthy oils" (learn how they are made and you won't either W.A Price.org) a little good old bacon grease for flavor(that our bodies know how to digest) and olive oil. I started out cooking at 450 for 10 min then when I noticed it wasn't getting crisp I raised it to the top rack and broiled for 5 minutes. It was perfect as good as any backyard fish fry I have ever attended.

I had my doubts about this recipe...fish, croutons...not too sure.  But went ahead and made it and I must say it was A BIG HIT at my house.  I thought my husband wouldn't go for it but he loved it.  My kids did too!  It was a great healthy recipe and now is saved in my recipe box with my other favourite ones.  The only thing I didnt use was the Pepperidge Farms Cut Zesty because I had no idea what it was and I didn't have any so I used fine breadcrumbs combined with the crushed multigran croutons I had.  Yum!

Super easy to make and my kid who is a picky eater, loved it. I used Tilapia this time around since that is all I could get my hands on at the grocery store. I cooked it for 15-20 mins since the chunks of fish were on the thick side. I'll be making this again, thanks for sharing...

I have never breaded any kind of meat or fish before and found it really easy.  I didn't get the crumb to stick as much as I would have liked but still tasty.  Only thing I changed was to use frozen cod steaks instead of fresh fillets as they were half the price.  Will be making again.

My family loved this.  I didn't have croutons so I used an herbed stuffing mix that I pulsed in the food processor.  I also followed the suggestion of other reviewers and did a light coat of flour, that I seasoned with Old Bay, then dipped in milk, & then into the crumbs.

It was tasty but alittle mushy for me. You just can't beat the taste of fried fish. I don't eat fish that often but I think I'll fry it next time.

This fish was a big hit at our house! I used halibut fillets, which were quite thick, so I baked them for a few extra minutes. My husband, who is leery of fish, had two helpings! I used garlic and butter flavoured croutons. Will definitely make these again. Thanks!

Definate do over.  Baking on a rack, this step must be observed.  Fantastic flavour.  I tried it with whole wheat bread crumbs, couldnt have been tastier.

I find it better to NOT measure each ingredient, because it gets wasted. I rather add more then have too much. Texture was good, 8 minutes each side....but... for us it REALLY needed some lemon juice, then it became a 5 star. The + is the prep time is very quick.

Crispiest fish ever.  Skipped the first milk bath and used ranch flavored crutons.  Nice to have a fish dish that tastes just as good as fried.

i liked the idea of this. i added a lot of spices to suit our tastes but the coating was gummy and pasty like another reviewer's complaint.
