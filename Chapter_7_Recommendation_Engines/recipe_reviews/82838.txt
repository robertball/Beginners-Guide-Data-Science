These taste great.  I had to use extra olive oil and garlic in order to cover all of my bread pieces.  Also, I could only bake for about 13 minutes instead of 15.

So simple, so good! I just used the wheat bread we had at the time and added a little onion power to the garlic and oil. YUM! Would be great with soups too.

Pretty good. They had a nice flavour, and good texture. I like being able to make things rather then purchase them, so this was a good recipe for me :)
