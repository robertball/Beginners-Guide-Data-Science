I was impressed with this crust - a little different than the pizza crust I usually make.  I pureed the sauce with an immersion blender.  There was more sauce than I needed for the pizzas but we don't like a lot of sauce.  I topped the pizzas with olives, red onions, green onions, mushrooms and fresh pineapple.  Very nice indeed!

Recipe Group Selection:  1, March 2014 ~ A nice different pizza crust.  I made up the dough in the morning in my bread machine.  After rising nicely in the fridge all day, we had to leave before I could prepare the pizza.  I split the dough into 2 packages and froze them.  I put one in the fridge today and let it re-rise all day.  It rose again, very nicely.  I did prebake the crust at 450° for 5 minutes before adding the toppings.  For the sauce, I cut the oregano back to ¾ tablespoon and added 1 tablespoon sugar.  We really liked the taste of the sauce with my adjustments.  For the toppings we had:  a mixture of mozzarella, sharp cheddar and Monterey jack cheese (3 partial pkgs. in the freezer); thin onion slices; red, orange and green pepper rings, cottage cheese, jalapeño rings, and fresh nasturtium leaves.  We really enjoyed everything about this pizza.  The crust had a nice crispness to it, and I’m wondering if that came from the egg.  Good recipe selection this week.  Thanks Bird for sharing your recipe.

This has become my go-to recipe for pizza dough and sauce. I always mix up the veggies and cheeses, but definitely a keeper for my family. I do like to add a little rosemary into the flour mix. I also take the sugar from the flour mix and put it into my yeast mix. I find it helps it foam up much easier (learned from making bread many times over).

Made this for Recipe Group...Delicious! I did not use the oregano in the dough, and reduced the amount in the sauce to 1 tsp., per personal preference. The only other thin I think I'd do differently next time is add a bit of sugar to the sauce to reduce the acidity. I made the dough earlier in the day in my bread machine, and par baked my crusts. When it was getting close to dinner, I just had to assemble them, easy peasy! I got 2-12 inch pizzas out of this. The dough crisped up nicely, which we really enjoyed. This is a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Recipe Group selection for the week of March 1, 2014.  -  This pizza dough recipe was different than the usual pizza dough recipes I’ve made because of the egg.  Also, I’ve never made a pizza dough where you needed to sift the flour.  So, I was curious as to how this would turn out.  It was a nice dough, but not my favorite.  I wouldn’t bother with the sifting, combining in a separate bowl method; just plop the remainder of the dough ingredients into the proofed yeast and process it as you would any regular pizza dough.  I didn’t bother with making the sauce because I had leftover tomato sauce which I used.  This pizza was an excellent way to use up leftover vegetables.

remember to go a bit light on the cheese and that way you can avoid a lot of extra sodium

Made this pizza last night. It was unexpectedly wonderful, tasty. slightly overcooked as it was second time I ever made any pizza but came out with crispy base. wonderful pizza better than some pizza shops.
would definitely recommend this dish. I will try again next weekend.

Made as written with the exception of 2 garlic cloves in the sauce instead of just one. My veggies were, carrots, spinach, and onions and it was the best tasting pizza I think we have eaten.

I just used the dough recipe and timing and it worked out great!  I used prosciutto, green olives, arugula, fresh basil, sun-dried tomatoes, Benedictine Blue (blue cheese with a slightly mushroomie flavour), and olive oil for a white pizza and it was delish!  :)

I thought this was pretty good pizza.  I particularly liked the sauce.  The crust didn't quite live up to my expectations, as in not being crispy enough for my tastes, although it was crispier than a lot of other crusts I've tried. The sauce was really easy to make and had great flavor.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Bird!

Wonderful recipe! Sauce was a little runny but the taste was amazing. I added honey on the rim of the crust and folded it over before baking. Perfection :)
