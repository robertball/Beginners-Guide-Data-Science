Thanks for the recipe. For my take I added my favorite Greek Vingerette salad dressing and water to start. Added some green olives and cucumber and tomatoes as well. Enjoy!

Simple yet tasty. I cut the portions back to 3 and used homemade chicken broth and tomato sauce that I caned, no other changes. Thanks for sharing.
