This was just OK - I like the "Marinated Mushrooms II" recipe much beter from this website. - On this recipe - I made a few modifications - DO NOT ADD THE WATER!! - it does not need it - once the mushrooms cook a bit - it releases its own liquid into the sauce. I substituted olive oil for the oil. I felt like this recipe lacked taste - I added grainy mustard to adzing - the red wine vinegar was not strong enough. Also - I added the mushrooms to the pan when the mushrooms were half way cooked - Otherwise the peppers would have cooked mush quicker and have gotten very mushy in pan.

This recipe was very tasty. I love the blend of mushrooms and peppers. My only suggestion is to leave out the sugar. This recipe already has so many hearty ingredients, the veggies, seasonings, vinegar... no need to taint it with sugar.

I didn't think the water was necessary.  It lacked a little flavor.

The mixture was quite tart as is so after I had cooked the mushrooms and bell peppers ( I sliced them instead of diced) as directed,  I added about 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil.  I also steamed asparagus separately and added the hot mixture over the steamed asparagus.  Then I added some calamata olives and marinated artichoke hearts with some of that marinade also.  Got good reviews from the party.  I would give it a five star after my changes.

Thank you for this simple and easy recipe. I have an abundance of bell peppers from my garden and am looking for different ways of preparing them. I did modify the recipe by using 1 whole onion cut in rings and several red bell peppers.

I tried this and instead of using 1 red pepper I used 6 small sweet peppers.  I also added 2 Tablsp onion and close to double the sugar as the red wine vinegar was quite bitey.  My husband loved it and I'm sure I will make it many more times in the future!
