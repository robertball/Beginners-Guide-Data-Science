I was pretty excited to find this recipe - my favorite cafe' makes these humongous crinkles that are so dark they're black! But sadly, although these were pretty good, they were not like the ones at the cafe'. I give it 4 stars because they were fudgy and had a good flavor and everyone liked them, but they just weren't the ones I was hoping for. A note about working with the sticky dough - I'm glad I read other reviews. I put mine in the freezer for about 45 minutes and used spoons to scoop out the dough DIRECTLY into the powdered sugar. Once the dough was in the sugar, they were easy to handle and just plopped into a perfect circle onto the pan. And you MUST used GREASED pans or they WILL stick terribly because of the powdered sugar on the bottom of the cookie.

These are my childhood favorite.  I make them every christmas.  Thing is I'm lazy, so i created a different recipe with the same dough, so i get two types of cookies for the same work.  Instead of rolling them in powdered sugar, i roll some in regular granulated sugar and then after they come out of the oven, i pop a hershey hug on top.  they're pretty and again, two cookies with the effort of one.  no one even recognizes they're the same. easy peasy

This is a yummy-foolproof cookie recipe.  To intensify the chocolate "experience," I added 1/2 cup melted bittersweet chocolate and used dutch-processed cocoa powder.  For those who are having trouble with the top cracking, here's a tip:  Place your cookie sheet on the second to-the-top rack and only bake one cookie sheet at a time.  The hot heat at the top of the oven enables the cookie to crack.  This trick also works for ginger snaps.

I've made these so many times and they always turn out! Make sure to coat them with enough powdered sugar to get them to "crinkle."

Here are some suggestions: Divide the dough into two and spread it out in a plate. Put it in the freezer for 30-45 minutes. Before forming them into balls, get your hands wet so they won't stick to them. You might have to pop them back in the freezer if it's a hot day just DON'T try to handle them when they're warm because you will just be wasting your time. Also, get creative with them! I've made them with cinnamon one time and I coated them with powdered sugar mixed with cinnamon and those turned out GREAT :)

This is a very good recipe. I'm so glad I found it. Since parchment paper is way too valuable in my kitchen for so many cookies, I find a light oiling of the cookie sheet works better for me. The cookies come off much easier than the parchment paper.

To make these more intensely chocolate I used part black cocoa for about a third of the cocoa called for. The parchment worked like a dream and the cookies, which I coated heavily with powdered sugar, were beautiful. However, hubs said this wasn't his favorite cookie because it tasted like a moist, fudgey brownie.  I guess that makes these 5-star cookies.

After mixing up this dough, I was sure I had made a mistake because it was so thin, more like cake batter. Double-checked the recipe and I had done it correctly. I thought to myself that I'd never be able to make cookies out of THAT. I was sure wrong about that! It makes very lovely cookies and not only do they look good, they taste good! They make quite a striking presentation on a holiday cookie tray.

Great recipe!  I added 1 cup chocolate chips and substituted 1 teaspoon peppermint extract for the vanilla.  My kids liked them better than Girl Scouts Thin Mints, which is high praise in my house.  Yummy!

These cookies were a delight to make.  They were simple, moist and delicious.  Doubling the recipe and using a 1 Tablespoon measure per cookie, I yielded about 80 cookies.  As a side note:  I noticed that a few people had troubles with getting these cookies to "crinkle".  Therefore, I made sure to coat them with enough powdered sugar and then baked them for the full time indicated to ensure a good "crinkle". They turned out perfectly.  I hope this helps!  Enjoy!

This is one of the few recipes I would give a 10 if I could.. chewy, moist brownie type cookie.. Dont be fooled and let them bake 10 minutes, they will look done before, but learn from my mistake. I took them out at 8 minutes and they were raw in the middle. So 10 minutes does the trick! I have 2 things to say: one is i cant imagine why these dont "crinkle" for some people, its impossible for them not to crinkle, because as they spread the sugar spreads and well, they will crinkle! LOL. And 2, after spraying the sheet and using parchment paper i learned whats important is to transfer these to a wire rack after one minute.. NO MORE THAN 2 MINUTES! as they cool they will stick to whatever they are on!. good luck!

A great holiday variation of these cookies is to add a few drops of peppermint extract to the batter - it's like peppermint patty cookies. Kids love them.

This is by far the best cookie recipe I've ever made and for many, many reasons. All the ingredients are things I already have laying around. It's a very simple recipe, the steps are pretty basic. But the kicker is the versatility! I have made the recipe as-written several times and each time they are spectacular. Other variations: roll the dough in dark chocolate cocoa powder instead of confectioner's sugar then drizzle icing in a pretty pattern once they've cooled.. very chic looking. I've also rolled them in granulated sugar and then popped a frozen Hershey's Candy Cane Hug (OMG.. this is incredible.. the mint and chocolate and creaminess.. just OMG). Play around with the recipe! Thank you so much for sharing this!!

These tasted just like a brownie to me- chewy, moist and fudgy; delicious!  My three year old daughter helped roll them in sugar and we both had fun.  I used half whole-wheat pastry flour but kept everything else the same.  Used a cookie scoop to "roll" them and got only 3 dozen.  Took another reviewer's advice and used the second from the top oven rack, and they turned out crinkly and beautiful.

These are delicious, rich cookies that remind me of tiny brownies. I have been making these cookies for years, every Christmas. These are like mini fudgy brownies, and I always make this dough the day before I plan to bake these. I found that the more chilled/cold the dough is, the easier it is to roll in balls, and since I heavily coat these with the powdered sugar, they are beautiful after baking. The sugar doesn't absorb into the cookie at all. Be sure to use the parchment paper too, it really makes a difference. Everyone loves these :)

Should be called "Brownie Crinkles." Used canola oil and added 1/2 tsp soda to alkalize the acidity of the Hershey's cocoa - would not add soda if using Dutch cocoa, as it is already alkalized. Baked for 10 minutes exactly and texture was like fudgy, mini brownies. Added 1 cup chopped white chocolate. Excellent in every way!

These are the best cookies I've ever eaten. Seriously. I would buy them from myself. I took someone elses advice and reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup for a more chocolatey flavor and I put the batter in the freezer for 45 minutes and they turned out great. The sticky batter was annoying but well worth it. I sprayed the cookie sheet too since I didn't have parchment paper. My husband loved these. He closed his eyes while eating them! That never happens! Anyway, thanks for the great recipe!

This was the first time I had tried making these cookies, but still I decided to tweek the recipe just a bit by adding 2 tsp peppermint extract in addition to the vanilla extract. They turned out fantastic! Make them small and they turn out firm on the outside while still soft in the middle. And use LOTS of powdered sugar.

This is a great recipe.  Keep the dough refrigerated and take out only enough to workwith.  I found that once the dough gets warm it gets quite sticky and the cookies don't hold their shape well when baked.  The cooler the dough is while shaping the nicer the cookies look when baked.  I used a melon baller for size.

These cookies are chewy, chocolatey goodness.  The ONLY reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is because I was hoping for a thicker cookie.  They baked fairly thin and I was hoping for something like my grandma used to make that was thicker.  I did put the dough in the freezer for a little while before scooping with my smallest ice cream scoop and dropping directly into the powdered sugar.  Then I didn't have a gooey mess on my hands.  Very yummy cookie over all just wish they were thicker.

amazing cookies! I made these yesterday for a party, and was asked for the recipe. I followed the recipe exactly, except I didn't have time to let them chill for 4 hours. Instead I placed half the dough into the freezer for 45 mins-1 hour, and made those for the party. The other half went into the fridge and I baked them today--no difference in the two, both are delicious and look beautiful! I ended up with about 4 dozen total.

Very good! This was just about the stickiest dough I've ever worked with. 45 minutes in the freezer got it solid enough to continue. Made into large balls for two sheets of 16. Perfect at 14 minutes. Yummmmmm.

soooooo deliciously good. I wish I hadn't halved the recipe now. I might just have to make another batch. They taste like little brownie bites. I froze my batter for 45 minutes prior to making balls, as per reviewers' suggestions. I used my cookie scoop and plopped them right in the powdered sugar and then rolled them into balls. I had no problems whatsoever with stickiness. I coated them heavily in the powdered sugar and was rewarded with a beautiful crackly-top! I will most definitely make these again...probably tomorrow, in fact! ;)

Deliciously moist cookie!  Do not shake off the excess powdered sugar, it needs a that little extra sweetness.  Secondly, this recipes does NOT make 72 cookies!  I made it and got 24 cookies using a tablespoon size scoop, which would mean to get 72 you would need a teaspoon size scoop.

These were the BEST cookies! My hubby and I both loved them. They taste like cookie brownies. Mine crinkled fine. I put them in the freezer for about an hour and a half and scooped directly into the powdered sugar. I had no trouble handling them. I added some mini chocolate chips to mine. I made sure to coat them with quite a bit of powdered sugar.  A delightful new addition to my Christmas baking!

These are just like the ones I used to bake with my mother!  I've made this recipe twice now, and the second time I replaced half of the oil with some fat free strawberry yogurt and they turned out great.  Plus, these seem incredibly healthy in the fat department as far as cookies go!

First time poster here. I will start by saying that I've always wanted a (insert obvious brand name) mixer. After some personal struggle over the last couple of years, I was finally in a position to purchase said mixer. This was the first recipe made with this magical machine. 

Anyhoo...




I am an experienced baker. But I still follow directions with unfamiliar recipes. As I did in this case. To the letter. Carefully following the recipe, I made what looked more like a thick batter. Similar to how my brownie batter used to look (and taste for that matter). I made the cookie dough the night before, so I assumed it would set up. The next day I pulled the bowl out of the fridge and behold! it had firmed up quite nicely.

If you don't have a cookie scoop get one. This dough was so scoopable. You can find online for a lot cheaper than the kitchen gadget places sell them for. 

I scooped a few balls into some icing sugar and was surprised and how much sugar adhered. You can knock some off if you want, but the dough itself isn't that sweet, so the added sweetness the sugar brings to the finished product is nice. 

From here on out, slap 'em on a cookie sheet and bake. They come out exactly the way they are shown in the pics I've seen. Really nice presentation with the cracked surface.  

And they taste fantastic. Real nice heavy hit of chocolate in a nice very soft almost chewy consistency / texture. And they stay that way for a solid few days. Two words Yuh Mee.

Wow, delicious and so easy! I totally skipped the chilling step, and they still turned out perfectly! As another reviewer said, they look just like the picture. I also added a little bit of orange zest, which was tasty and added a nice contrast. Next time I might skip the powdered sugar since the cookies are already so sweet. Maybe give them a roll in cinnamon-sugar, instead.

I also really like that I could use a heart-healthy oil instead of butter. Thanks for such a GREAT and EASY recipe!

These are great cookies.  Hint:  If you roll the dough in regular sugar before the Confectioners sugar it acts as a buffer and you get a better crinkle pattern

Terrific! I only had 1/4 cup oil so I melted 1/4 cup shortening and added the two together. Placed the dough in the freezer for an hour. Baked up nice and fluffy. Nice chewy consistency. Thank you for the recipe!!

I made these for a black and white party. These cookies aren't overly sweet and they have a chewy texture. Make sure the dough is thoroughly chilled, or your results will vary, Give it a nice coating of the powdered sugar or you won't get the dramatic effect. People asked for the recipe that night!

Great cookies!  Very much like a brownie in taste and quite chewy as well.  I coated my cookies in a lot of powdered sugar and also baked on the 2nd highest rack in the oven as suggested by others.  I was able to make about 54 cookies.  They's so pretty too!

My mom has had this recipe for years, and I'd never made it.  I'd always made them using boxed cake mix, but hated all the chemicals.  These are SO good!  I made them for a huge family holiday party, and they were gone right away, with lots of compliments.  If you chill them overnight, and then "flour" your hands with powdered sugar, they aren't overly sticky.  Take them out of the oven when just the edges are set, and let them sit on the pan to finish for a minute or so.  DO NOT bake them through in the oven, or they will be overdone.  No boxed mix cookies for me anymore.  Wish I'd used my mom's recipe years ago!

I followed this recipe completely.  The cookies were just as beautiful as the photo but were ordinary and tasteless.  I brought them to my poker group and no-one liked them.  Will not bake these again.

I saved these months ago when they were featured on the front page to make for Christmas. The cookies looked beautiful.. just like the picture! However, they were an absolute PAIN to make. After only a couple of minutes, they were turning to complete goo. They were almost impossible to roll. After we managed to get them all on the cookie sheet, I was hoping they were the best cookies ever, but the simply tasted alright. If I were to make again (which I won't), I would freeze the batter/dough before rolling. It might help it stay manageable longer. I do it with my peanut butter cookies every year with much success.

Excellent cookie! We really liked the more intense chocolate flavor of Ghirardelli Cocoa in the past so that is what I used in these. Followed the recipe and the result is a deep, dark, moist, very chocolate cookie. Remember to allow at least 4 hours in the fridge for the correct shape and texture. These are going on the holiday baking list. Thanks for sharing!

I was so excited to try this recipe but was VERY disappointed.  The cookies seem to have too much vanilla and were not that flavorful.  I think the cookies that are made with melted chocolate are better even though they are more work.

My only change was using 3 jumbo eggs and I mixed the whole thing with a wooden spoon -didn't even take out the mixer.  They taste like rich little brownie bites!  Chocolate lovers will be in heaven!

Yum ! So I made these and for some reason only added two egss; realized my mistake when the batter was EXTREMELY dry! Added the other two eggs afterward (and prayed they would turn out okay) The batter was thick and not at all sticky! I went ahead and chilled the dough- but really didnt need to! They turned out perfect, more like brownies then cookies, but I made a whole batch 2 hours ago and took them to the inlaws for dinner, and have less than half remaining already! This will be a Christmas regular in out household!!

This is the actual meaning of chocolate cookies. They lacked a bit of sugar, in my opinion, but were great since you usually get extra sweet recipes and this tastes exclusively like chocolate.

Perfect, easy cookie.  On a whim, decided to bake these at 8 pm so I hurried the chilling process along by placing the batter in the freezer for 45 minutes.  Baked for 11 minutes and they came out great!  Will definitely use this recipe on a frequent basis.  Thanks for sharing :)

What an easy recipe!  I was able to toss all the ingredients while talking on the phone.  Fridged the dough overnight.  You have to work with it pretty quickly since it gets soft and sticky pretty fast.  But that won't deter me from making this again.  The cookies came out with a little crust and were soft on the inside.  I cut down the sugar from 2 cups to 1.5 cups.

Loved the cookies! I had them chill in the fridge overnight and they still stuck to my hands when I was rolling them into balls. You have to do it incredibly fast, otherwise it gets really messy.

This is just the kind of fudgey treat I was looking for. If you like dark chocolate, reduce the sugar by 25%- it makes the cocoa stand out more.

This is the second time I'm rating this recipe.  After having tried several other cookie recipes from this site with even more reviews, I've concluded that this is by far the best.  If you're the type of person who loves to bake and loves to get rave reviews from friends, this is the cookie recipe to end all cookie recipes.  Much kudos to you, Ingrid!

Great, my chocoholic husband loved them. Just baked them on a greased cookie sheet at about 325. Put them in freezer for an hour to chill and used a mellon baller to scoop out. Delicious

I DON'T bake,  so when I try to make cookies from scratch it better be simple.... this recipe was great! I made them for Christmas Eve.  got the mix done, chilled for about 3 hrs and baked perfectly with very little effort.  I used an ice cream scooper and rolled them into semi-tight little balls and didn't have a problem with too much sticking.  you just gotta roll fast and plop into sugar. 

I this used those large foil type cookie trays (the dollar store type) so I can't speak on the need to grease the sheet,  I didn't and they slid off without a spatula.  I baked them on the second from top rack for 11 min.  

every one loved them and I have some picky people here.  I'd say they are like a cookie/brownie.

If there's a word or phrase that means "Way better than perfect!" it's the only way to describe these cookies!

My only "change" to the directions was, I didn't measure the dough as I rolled each cookie out. Somehow, it worked out to exactly ten dozen.

My wife and I are tapping each other on the wrist so we don't eat 'em all in one day...

Yum!!!! These were very good! I cut the sugar down to 1 3/4 cups, and stuck them in the freezer for an hour instead of the fridge for 4 hours. Worked out great! Very chocolaty, and therefore very good!

As per some reviews, this batter is on the thin side, but after refridgerating it's not bad. The dough is sticky and hard to handle with a scoop. Definately use parchment paper to save yourself clean up. I baked these more like 15-17 min. Touch the top lightly before you take out of the oven. If it still feels soft and like its not done, add like 3 more minutes. I also had to let these rest on the sheet after taking out of the oven, so they wouldn't come apart upon transferring to a cooling rack. As far as flavor,and moistness they're pretty good, but they flatten out upon baking, they don't look like the pic. I'll probably look for a better recipe in the future of chocolate crinkle cookie baking.

These cookies were a disaster.  I follwed the recipe exactly.  They came out as flat as a pancake and ran into each other.  Not sure what I did wrong.  They tasted good but looked horrible.

What a very pretty looking cookie! And, the recipe was quite easy to make to. Very little clean-up. I did half the recipe to try it out and got 23 cookies using a standard 1 Tablespoon cookie scoop. I also still had to refridgerate the full 4 hours. Mine took about 14 minutes to bake, but must have been slightly larger than the original recipe size. I will probably make next Christmas. Thanks!

These look great. They were perfectly crinkled and puffy for me. I can taste the unsweetened chocolate, so personally I would like them a bit sweeter I guess. Maybe next time I'll add chocolate chips. 12 minutes seemed perfect for my oven.

I didn't care for these cookies.  Not only are they devoid of flavor but the cookies refused to flatten while baking.  They stayed in the ball shape.

What a marvelous little recipe!  I've never made these before & wasn't sure what to expect.  To me they are a round, snowy brownie. After cooling, I dropped the individual spoonfuls of dough directly onto a saucer of icing sugar.  Then I dusted my palms with icing sugar when I rolled them to keep from sticking & heating up in my hands.  Worked perfectly! Off to a cookie exchange tomorrow, happily taking my Crinkles. Thanks Ingrid.

My tips- don't skimp on the confectioners sugar. And roll them around good to make the sugar stick.  The dough is very sticky; I ended up sticking my hands in ice water, drying them quickly and then rolling about 5 cookies at a time.  Make sure you dry them, otherwise the outside is too damp and the sugar ended up looking like icing. Otherwise the dough stuck to my hands a lot. I did one sheet at a time, on the top shelf and used the convection setting on my oven.  Very good, like eating cooked fudge.

Wow! I loved these.... They really melt in your mouth and were pretty simple.  I took others advise and added chocolate chips for extra chocolate flavor and chilled the dough for longer. It was sticky but the end product is sooooo worth it.  I also rolled the cookies twice and my crinkles were perfect. This is a staple for our cookie cravings!!!

These were both easy and delectable. Cook time very accurate- I agree with earlier reviewers- freeze this dough first and handling is a dream. A drop of peppermint in the dough come Christmas? Heaven.

I've made these for many years.  They are so good.  I roll the dough in my hands into a ball before coating in the powdered sugar.  This gives you a really nicely shaped cookie.  Make sure you refrigerate the dough for the time specified or it will be too soft in your hands.

i might have done something wrong because the dough was more like a batter even when left in the fridge for over a day. and they flattened badly in the oven.
and it was a bit too sweet... but with the ingredients listed, i think they made up fairly nice cookies

The batter was looking a bit dry so I added a couple dashes of milk. The batter then turned cake like which made it impossible to form into balls. So when they we finished they looked nothing like the picture. I expected them to be incredibly moist but they were still dry! They also had a bland taste.

These were okay. Yes, they were a cinch to make but I think it's seriously lacking something! Definitely needs more chocolate flavour or a kick of espresso. I'd probably add something to enhance the chocolate flavour (ie. chocolate ganache or nutella thumbprint, melted chocolate to the batter, 2 tsps of instant espresso). Good base recipe though with room for improvement.

These turned out great the 1st time.  After chilling the dough, you may want to flatten the ball just a little bit before baking so it's a flatter crinkle.  Be careful not to overbake them as they will turn out rough and dry.  Underbaked is better than overbaked because they will still cook when taken out of the oven.

I've made these several times but realized yesterday I'd never reviewed them. Every time I make these cookies they're a hit. Everyone raves about them. The only change I've made is I use butter instead of vegetable oil and I don't bother chilling for 4 hours. I chill in the freezer for an hour then roll and bake as directed.

Oh my god these were so delicious without any changes! I love how these cookies utilize the 2:1 ratio of sugar to cocoa powder. It is my favourite ratio when using cocoa powder for baking, you get lots of rich chocolate flavour without your dessert getting too sweet. I made 1/4 the full recipe and ended up with 12 cookies. Chilled the dough in the freezer for about 15mins. I baked my cookies on a sheet of parchment paper, set my oven rack to second rack below the top heating element. Cookies crackled perfectly and were done baking in 10mins. Beautiful and yummy!

Very easy to make! The cookie tastes like the edge of a pan of brownies for those of you who like those corner pieces! Note: this recipe does not make as many cookies as are stated. Great recipe though, I recommend it strongly.

This is an easy and foolproof recipe, albeit a bit messy with the confectioner's sugar. Very chocolatey and will definitely make again.

Okay, i know this has potential to be better, everything worked fine, popped in the freezer for 40min or so then shaped and dipped in sugar.
But when i baked they flattened out and merged!! So essentially i had a massive brownie made of lil brownies. I am sure this is some fault of mine...lol!
And the taste: well the batter was divine but the baked product wasn't as flavourful as I hoped, will try again based on reviews :)

Very good.  Baked as written.  Messy cookie, but oh so good.  Brownie like with a warm gooey center fresh from the oven.  Will make again.

These are VERY good and a big hit when I bring them places.  I use a 1" cookie scoop for consistent sizing.

A little piece of cookie perfection!!  We baked them just as written.  Not only were these DELICIOUS....we loved how they looked when they came out of the oven. Devoured by my 3 children and myself.  So, so pleased. A definite Christmas cookie keeper. Thank you for this recipe!!

Really great cookie!  Dough is a bit frustrating, as it's very sticky.  Mine sat in the fridge for 2 days covered, until I had time to bake, and all I can say is roll them quickly and keep what you haven't used yet in the fridge.  Love the crackle top.  I will also say that you really need to line the cookie sheets, either with silicon liners or parchment.  I tried both, and the silicon stuck a tiny bit and the parchment released beautifully, as it should.  Next time will only use parchment.  Thanks for sharing!

Okay my family really liked these... They were lots like a fudgy brownie instead of a cookie. Don't be alarmed by the pre-baking consistency, it ends up fine.  I did use butter instead of oil, and added a cup of chocolate chips. Very nice!

Sweet!  I mean that figuratively and literally.  :)  We all enjoyed these immensely.  I ate a few more than I was supposed to.  Thanks, Ingrid!  I followed the directions almost exactly--the only change I made was to speed the process by using someone's idea of freezing for forty-five minutes instead of chilling for three hours.  I'm not that patient when I need a sugar fix.  My cookies spread perfectly, and I got a nice crinkle on the top.  I baked in two batches the way some reviewer or other recommended to keep from losing the crinkle effect.  I don't know if it worked or not, because I didn't try it another way, but my cookies were gorgeous!

Love these cookies!  I have made ones with orange extract, ones with peppermint, and ones with cherry extract.  We also used Hershey kisses to make them festive.

These were extremely good! Perfect for my chocolate fix, though I did kind of alter that. In addition to the 1 c. cocoa, I melted 1 oz semi-sweet bakers chocolate, 1/4 c. dark chocolate chips, and 1/4 c. semi-sweet chocolate chips. Added that to the cocoa/sugar/oil mixture and then kept going with the rest of the ingredients. I also let the batter sit for a couple of hours in my warm kitchen to help the chocolate blend together. Put the batter in the freezer for 6 hours and let it sit on the counter for 30 minutes before I worked with it. I didn't have ANY problems with the dough being too sticky, and my house was pretty warm at the time. Used a #50 scoop and plopped the dough right into the powdered sugar. You HAVE to grease the sheets, otherwise these are a monster to get off the sheet! Overall, GREAT recipe.

Very tasty little cookie!  I usually try to cut the fat and sugar, so I made the following modifications.  I used 1C sugar and 1C Splenda, 1/4C oil and 1/4C unsweetened applesauce, and I used 1C Better n'Eggs instead of actual eggs.  I didn't have confectioner's sugar, so I rolled them in granulated sugar, and I greased the cookie sheet instead of using parchment.  At the suggestion of another reviewer, I replaced half of the vanilla with peppermint extract, which was great.  I highly recommend keeping a small bowl of water by the mixing bowl so you can dip your fingers in the water when taking the chilled mix out of the bowl to put in the sugar so it doesn't stick to your hands.  I also put the batter in the freezer for 45 minutes instead of the fridge so I would have my cookies sooner! :-)

Love them!!! I followed the idea of substituting half of the oil by yogurt, and also opted for adding some chopped up haselnuts, walnuts and dark chocolate....so good!!! This was actually the first time I made cookies....ever...but it definitely will not be the last one :-)

Amazing and very simple! For my dad's birthday, I wanted to make him these but his baking supplies were very limited. I had to beat everything with a fork and really doubted that they'd turn out. I was completely wrong, they turned out very nicely, and hardly took any effort at all. I read the reviews first, and put them in the freezer for 45 minutes instead of 4 hours in the fridge, dropping them in the icing sugar before rolling into balls. Thank you so much for this recipe and I'll definitely be making them again. Easier AND better tasting than chocolate chip cookies, that says a lot :)

Wow!  I followed the recipe exactly and found them to be delicious!  They taste just like a brownie but you don't have to wait as long for them to cool.  You can forget handling the dough.  Chilling it helped.  Just use spoons and expect it to be sticky.  GREAT RECIPE!

I'm not understanding all the 5-star ratings.  These tasted "OK", but the batter, even after setting up in the freezer for 1.5 hours, was still extremely soft and difficult to work with.  I had to use one spoon to scoop out the batter and another to scrape the batter off the spoon into the powdered sugar (I used rounded tablespoon. Have no idea what a "#50 scoop" is.)  Only after each blob had some sugar on it could I roll it into a ball without it sticking all over my hands, then I recoated in the sugar before placing on the pan. This process took so long that by the time it went into the oven, the balls had begun to flatten out on their own.  Seriously, these were a lot of work for cookies that taste a whole lot like I took a brownie mix and turned it into an extremely soft cookie dough!

These were SO good. Ridiculously good!! Tasted a bit like a rich brownie. Will definitely be making these again, thanks!  And to the reviewer who ended up with flat cookies... it sounds like you forgot to add the baking powder. Either that or maybe your powder is expired. Check the box.

wonderful!  wow, everyone loved these, instead of using all white flour as the recipe calls for, i used 1 cup white flour, 1/2 cup whole wheat, 1/2 cup almond flour (cheap at trader joes!) the cookies were amazing no one could tell they were slightly "healthier" in fact, i think it added to the flavor.  They were delicious, i will definitely be making them again, all my co-workers loved them. (make sure you wet your hands when your roll the balls!)

These were great!!  I did freeze the dough for about an hour, then dropped a spoonful onto powdered sugar and rolled it to coat the entire cookie.  I still greased my pan, and baked them for fourteen minutes - they came out perfect, and with no problems!

this recipe is great! and my family and boyfriend love them!! and i also found out that it was unnecessary to grease the pans. using ungreased aluminum foil to line the pan or just simply using a nonstick pan is best. greasing the pan (like with butter) just mixes with the powdered sugar and thus caramelizes the sugar.

Easy recipe creates a beautiful and delicious cookie. They looked absolutely perfect! Nice and chewy in the center and a bit crispy on the outside, they were one of the most popular Christmas cookies I made this year. But they don't keep long, even in an airtight container- they started to get stale after about 5 days.

Delicious!!!  This recipes is great.  Tried it with 1 tsp peppermint extract as one person suggested and they are like little pieces of heaven!  I like my cookies soft so I left them a little undercooked and they are almost a brownie consistency.  This is definitely a keeper, will be making for Christmas presents!

These are excellent! i made a batter for only 36 cookies, and I got 46 out of it, and they were PERFECT. it smelled like hot cocoa in the house when I removed them from the oven. I am going to give these as gifts this xmas.

These were pretty good.  Not as chocolatey as I would have liked another recipe that I tried, that was like this one, used melted bakers chocolate and that might have been what made the difference.  These were good none the less and I will be making them again.

These crinkles were perfect. To make them Christmas-y, I added red and green sugar sprinkles to the confectioners' sugar before rolling the cookies.

Well, I tried to get tricky and sub. applesauce for the oil.  Even after freezing overnite, the dough wasn't hard enough to handle.  I just used a scoop and dumped it right into the powdered sugar.  The sub. didn't affect the taste- wonderful, super good!  They are nice and chewy and cakey and chocolatey.  Thanks!

Great recipe!  Very moist and great flavor.  The only thing was that I couldn't get the powdered sugar crinkle to look crinkly, mine looked like they had spots on them!

I made these for Christmas and took them to my n-law's and my parent's.  They were a hit at both gatherings and they look amazing!  I only let my dough set for 3 hours before rolling the cookies out and they turned out fine!  The powdered sugar was a little messy for my toddler, but the cookies taste wonderful!

These were great.  Added some dark chocolate chips and peppermint hugs the some for variety.  Put in freezer for a bit and kept my hands wet when handling dough.  Thoroughly coated cookies in the confectioners sugar and baked on second to last shelf for the time stated and they were perfect!

Make sure to put the bowl in the freezer, not just the fridge. And also put it in the freezer in between batches - the dough gets VERY STICKY! Turned out great though.

These cookies are easy to make and are always one of the most popular items on my christmas cookie trays.
Peppermint extract is a tasty substitution for the vanilla if you want to try something different.

I've made this recipe every Christmas for many years. This time though, I decided to add a Hershey's white chocolate candy cane kiss to the top after the cookies are baked. The taste of the rich chocolate cookie with the minty kiss is AMAZING! When cookies are fully baked, gently squish a kiss on top, and let cool (Or stuff it in your face still warm and melty!)! Enjoy!!!

Good fudge cookie. When you want a chocolate fix, this will do it. Treat yourself with glass of red wine with it OR a dark beer. Yup, dark beer. Heavenly.

these get 5 stars for presentation and the fudgy type brownie consistency of the cookie.  I had to re-read the recipe after I got it mixed together for fear I had added too much of a liquid but I hadn't mismeasured anything.  The cookie batter is the consistency and appearance of brownie batter.  It is very soft.  I refrigerated the dough for a couple of hours and using my pampered chef small size cookie scoop, scooped directly into SIFTED confectioner's sugar.  this made it easy to handle and I could then roll into nice balls without any messy fingers.  This made a nice size batch using the smaller cookie scoop.  I did add a tsp of espresso powder to enhance the chocolate.  I think next time I will try adding some melted unsweetened chocolate squares for a deeper chocolate flavor.  these aren't something that can be whipped up and baked in no time; they do take time to refrigerate and roll.

I made 1 1/2 times the recipe, added 1/2 cup cocoa (since some people said it wasn't as rich as they expected, and it was too sticky) and 1/4 cup sugar and another Tablespoon good quality vanilla sugar.  I put the dough in the freezer for 1 1/2 hours.  It worked out fine, as, as soon as you start rolling the cookies into balls and gently covering with powdered sugar, some of the sugar stays on your hands and prevents the next cookie from sticking.  I used slightly heaping dessertspoons of the dough.  They turned out great!  (About 135 cookies -- not sure, cuz we were tasting!)

I have been using this recipe for years.  I make them every year for Christmas.  Because it is "that time of the year", I omit 1 tsp. of the vanilla extract and replace it with 1 tsp. peppermint flavoring.  Either way you make them, this is hands-down the best chocolate cookie recipe I've tasted.

My favorite chocolate cookie recipe ever!  It's amazing how rich and fudgy and chocolately it tastes - almost like a brownie.  It's so moist, yet not at all greasy (and uses so little oil!)  Also, if you take them out of the oven a bit early, they'll be like mini chocolate lava cakes - nice and softish-crunchy on the outside, but gooey and wonderful on the inside :).

Just like my mom used to make but using coco powder instead of melted unsweetened chocolate bars. I live in a country where unsweetened chocolate bars don't exist, so this was a nice alternative for me!

As I always do when I try a new recipe, I stay true to the ingredients and instructions. IMO, the only tweaking I would probably do is to add a bit of coffee in it just to intensify the chocolate flavor of the cookie. But that's just the chocoholic in me. My first batch came out looking good with the proper cracks and the kids were absolutely hooked! They are already asking me to make some for their school snacks. I remember having these decades ago and it was nostalgia that had me seeking this recipe. I love it!

I love these cookies!! I followed the recipe exactly (except for 1/2 cup more cocoa powder). My dough was not batter like, it was nice and thick. I did not refrigerate the dough prior to baking the first dozen and did not find it hard to handle. I used a cookie scoop and dropped them directly into a plastic bag of confectioners' sugar, rolled them in my hands to make round and placed them on a parchment paper lined cookies sheet. I had no problems with sticking and the cookies crinkled perfectly and had a beautiful shape, no problems with spreading. The remaining dough is in the freezer and I wil see if they bake any differently. I think I'll bake one batch without rolling them in confectioners' sugar and use them to make ice cream sandwiches. YUMMY just thinking about it!!

Since I am dieting, I replaced the white sugar with baking Splenda.  Didn't notice any difference.  Tasted like Devil's Food cake. Yumm.  However, it says it makes 72 servings...it only made 30 for me and I made them into 1 inch balls....

Really good cookie. Followed directions exactly, and they were perfect.  Used parchment paper and had no trouble with sticking to the pan or spreading.  You might have to re-refrigerate in between batches if it gets a little sticky, but it was actually easier dough to work with than I expected.  Made 45 cookies.  Also, like other reviewers, I just froze the dough for about an hour and it was fine.  My only problem was I had no idea how to tell if they were done, but it ended up working out in the end.

Im not sure what others were talking about with the cookie dough spreading out. Because I had no problems with.that. My only complaint is that even after chilling all day it was still sticky. I did put it in the freezer for 30 minutes and dusted my hands with confectionery sugar for easier handling. Having said that I love love this cookie!

Nice cookie but read the reviews because they are spot on. Needs more pow by adding chocolate, def do not want to over bake. 8 or 9 minutes max for my oven, and crackled very well. I will make again but with changes. May try the mint suggestions.

Love these!  They look so pretty, and it's nice to be able to have the kids (toddlers) help make them! They've got a nice little crunch on the outside and a soft and slightly chewy texture on the inside.  Be careful not to over cook them though, as they get hard.

These were pretty good!  My son requested I add chocolate chips.  I preferred them without the chocolate chips, but he ate several of them after telling me he didn't want any of the cookies.  Ahuh.

These were fantastic. Cracked beautifully and was nice and fudgey inside. Make sure you chill these long enough or you'll never be able to roll them. I coated my hands with powdered sugar for rolling into a ball and that helped a lot.

I didn't have any powdered sugar or parchment paper. I just sprayed the pan a lot more than I normally would and left the sugar off. Still turned out amazing.

amazing cookies! they taste just like brownies. i followed the recipe exactly. i used other reviewers suggestions and put the batter in the freezer for about 45 minutes, which works great. they are easy to handle once the balls have some confectioners sugar on them. i got about 35 palm size (some a bit smaller) cookies. will definitely use this recipe often.

These cookies were a hit. They look very hard to make but in reality they are just time consuming. They are worth the work. My friends and family loved them. You don't need to chill them the full 4 hours. I got away with about an hour and half. Enjoy!!

You definitely have to plop the "dough" (basically a brownie mixture) into the powdered sugar and roll it around to fully coat it. This makes the balls easy to handle and creates the "crinkles." Otherwise it will be sticky and very had to handle. Also followed other raters' advice to put the dough into the freezer about 45 minutes prior to baking. Very helpful. 

These we delicious! I might add a bit more sugar to the dough next time. Tried adding dark chocolate chips and that was great, too!

These are so good! My mom used to make something almost exactly like these every year for Christmas cookies, only her recipe called for mint-chocolate morsels. Which I guess they stopped making a few years back. Well I found a bag last year at some obscure store and just had to track down this recipe. The cookies are great by themselves, but the addition of the mint morsels really makes them outstanding!

I liked the recipe and they were very easy to make. I would like to say though that they are very dense and all you have to eat is one and you will feel full. I also want to say that for the fellow "cookie challenged" person that to get the flattened look for the pictures you need to mush down the cookies with a spoon or a fork, the cookies do not spread.

Great cookie.  I couldn't help but use melted butter instead of veg oil, and they tasted great.  I also greased my baking sheet, and if i hadn't, they would have been stuck to the sheet. I only refrigerated these for about 2 hours, and used a cookie scoop to measure and dropped them right in the powdered sugar.  Once they were in the sugar, they were no problem to roll.  These are a little tricky to tell if they're done, and i ended up cooking them for the full 12 min.  They remind me of the devil food cookies you can buy at a store.  Very pretty and a nice new addition.

Yum! Like a brownie kind of cookie.  I didn't want to wait the 4 hours so I put them in the freezer for about 15 minutes and used greased hands to form the balls.  A little messy but it worked! I put them in sealed containers and they're nice and soft.  I kinda wish they'd kept a bit of their crunch but they're delicious as is.  Oh, and I ran out of white sugar so subbed brown for about 1/3 cup.

These cookies are pretty good, but the directions should say something about how thin the dough is before chilling.  It seemed way too thin, more like brownie batter than cookie dough, so we thought maybe our eggs were too big or perhaps we didn't measure the vegetable oil correctly and, consequently, we added an extra half-cup of flour before chilling.  Because of this, the cookies aren't quite as fudgy as they probably should be.  If we had been given the information that the "dough" is more like a "batter", we'd have left well enough alone.  The presentation is beautiful, however, and the cookies DO taste good!  Five stars for presentation and taste, three stars for unclear directions, overall - four stars.  Thank you for sharing!

Awesome! So light and fluffy! Couldn't stop eating them. Followed other reviewer's advice about scooping the batter directly into the powdered sugar and then rolling into balls. It was much easier to handle.

I have made these cookies 3 times so far. Always a hit and definitely worth the effort. I was a little hesitant about the oil over butter or shortening, but these cookies are amazing. I freeze the dough and then use a melon baller to scoop them out. These bake better on a nonstick pan than they do on parchment. I never liked chocolate cookies before these, but now I love them!

I lost a recipe years ago that was similar to this. Unfortunatly I started making these without realizing I need to chill dough for 4 hrs. I made them anyway only chilled dough for about 1 -2 hrs and the dough was a gooey mess (hard to handle, sticky). They ended up tasting good but, didn't look like the pictures.

I made these cookies according to the ingredients and directions given.  I followed the advice of previous reviewers and baked one cookie sheet at a time on the second-from-top oven rack, and I got a perfect crinkle.  Chewy and chocolatey.  Sweet, but not too sweet.  Pretty and impressive!  Wahoo!  This will certainly be a favorite around this house!

delicious! crispy outside, brownie like inside. bake@second rack from top in the oven in order to 'crinkle', and flatten them slightly because they dont spread much. freezing them for 1.5 hrs is a good way to speed things up if you are pressed for time. i've made these for the past two years every christmas and they are beautiful and easy :) thanks!!

These cookies came out PERFECT!  Just the way I wanted them!!!  I tried another recipe before these, but they flattened out and were dry and hard...very disappointing.  I added a spicy twist to these.  I scaled the recipe down to 18 cookies and used Hershey's Special Dark cocoa and added  1/4 tsp of cracked peppercorn from my Peppercorn Medley and 1/2 tsp of cardamom.  Gave it a very exotic chai tea type flavor.  This recipe is a keeper!

5 stars: for how beautiful these cookies are, 4 stars: because my 3 year old could help me roll them in icing sugar without getting very dirty hands, 3 stars: because of the taste. I miss something! Because they are so pretty, I will make them again with an addition; coffee, peppermint extract, almond extract or coconut. My kids call them ' snow cookies'.

My husband's favorite Christmas cookies were Chocolate Crinkles, but his mom had lost the recipe.  This recipe has be accepted as the new offical "crinkle cookie" recipe - with no subsitutions.  Thanks for posting it.  I'm going to try making it will gluten free flour next. My little one really wants to have "crinkles" this year and can't eat wheat anymore.

I'm not a huge fan of cookies or chocolate, but I made these to take to work for my birthday. My coworkers and my fiance loved them (though the people wearing black pants had to be especially careful ^_^).   I did NOT get a yield of 6 dozen, but I have a tendency to scoop cookies kinda big so I will chalk that up to operator error.  The intenseness of the chocolate was perfect. I added a sprinkle of cinnamon on top of some of the cookies, which was delicious, and would like to try them with a dash of peppermint extract.   I split the dough into 2 bowls, spread thin, and put in the freezer for 45 minutes. Between batches I put the dough back in the freezer so that it wouldn't spread out/warm up. We had a dinner reservation while I was making cookies so I put the last half of the 2nd bowl in the fridge while we were gone, and it was still fairly easy to work with once we got back (except at the very end when I let it get too warm. Watch out--the consistency is like frosting if it's warm and is impossible to work with).   The cookies crinkled perfectly (cooked on 2nd to top rack) and stayed nice and soft inside for days when kept in an airtight container. Some of my coworkers were surprised by the soft texture, expecting them to be really hard like gingersnaps, but were pleasantly surprised by the cookie/brownie hybrid texture.  Great recipe--this will be my go-to cookie recipe from now on, I think. ^_^

I'm in love!!  I used food coloring to make the confectioner's sugar coating a powder blue.  I don't have good luck when making brownies, so I'm glad there's an easy cookie recipe that tastes like a brownie!  Best part - if you let it sit in your mouth for 30 or so seconds it tastes even better!

I make these often. These are better than I thought they would be! I underbake mine by a minute or so .Nice and chewy and gooey! I like to add chocolate chips to mine for a more chocolatey taste!..Very good.

I used mint extract instead of vanilla and added milk chocolate chips.  I will be making these again and probably very soon.  They reminded me of a fudge brownie mixed with a Girl Guides thin mint cookie.

These were sooo good. After making the batter and wanting a cookie, I realized that you had to chill the dough for 4 hours! No way. I spread the dough onto a sheet pan and put it in the freezer for about 20 mins. Then scooped and rolled the dough. I had to bake them for about 14 mins, and they were perfect. Still soft in the middle. These are definite keepers.

These were wonderful! I used a melon baller to form my cookies, and make them consistent in size. Then i rolled them in table sugar and THEN in confectioners sugar. This made them have a nice crinkly outside and a soft 'melt in you mouth' inside! My family and i ate 72 of these in twenty-four hours and we aren't fat people!

EXCELLENT recipe. Easy with few ingredients, and tastes sooo good. I refrigerated for 1 hour and froze the dough for another 45 minutes, and it was easy to work with. Don't be shy with the confectioner's sugar. The ones that were coated with the most sugar tasted best. Also, use good quality cocoa for the best taste. Thank you for this recipe!

These were the first cookies that I made with my mother in law for a Christmas cookie exchange. They are a pain in the butt to make, but a tasty cookie. Not my favorite, but based on everyone else's
.02 cents, it was enjoyed.

Great recipe.  I didn't use confectioner's sugar and the tops still crinkled.  Put the dough in the fridge if you want easy rolling, or you can put them out all spiky.  I had to swap 1/2 the sugar for brown sugar because of what I had on hand, but I think all white is best to get the cookies crisp enough.  Keep them small if you want them crisp - 3/4" balls.  They don't spread much when baking.  I think they tasted better the crisper they were.  I served them to guests who thought they were delicious.

This cookies are simply awesome! My mum's friends couldn't stop praising them! On a side note: Be sure to refrigerate the dough for 45 min. Then use a spoon to scoop the dough into a bowl of confectioners' sugar. Once it's in the sugar, it's easier to roll them into balls.
Otherwise, I followed this delightful recipe to a T. Overall, a wonderfully chocolatey cookie that has a beautiful presentation.

Choco-licious! And here's a trick for avoiding most of the mess. Instead of rolling the sticky dough into an even stickier ball and coating the ball in powdered sugar, try this. Drop a 1-inch spoonful of chilled dough into the powdered sugar and rotate the bowl round and round. The dough will roll itself into a sugar-coated ball, ready for you to pick up and place on the prepared cookie sheet! Alternatively, drop the dough into the powdered sugar and then roll the ball by hand. The sugar keeps the dough from sticking to your palms. These cookies literally fly off the plate...oh, so good!

Very tasty! Fudgy...sugary...what more could you ask for?! I made these for Thanksgiving and stuck to the recipe 100%; they were easy, and a big hit. Ten minutes was the perfect amount of time for them. I used Ghirardelli unsweetened cocoa powder and they came out nice and black, which was set off beautifully by the confectioner's sugar. Definitely a keeper!

I have to say I made this and you could totally taste the cocoa. I used Hershey unsweetened and it was horrible. I have always used the chocolate squares and thought to use something different. Also, I have never used parchment paper and that was a joke to use in the oven.

I finally found the perfect crinkles recipe.  I've tried some recipes using butter and it came out too flat.  A friend suggested I use butter flavored oil. I will try that next time.  But this recipe I followed exactly and it came out perfect.

My husband didn't like it. Too gooey he said. Anyway, after making this awhile ago, I learned that indeed, (1) I should GREASE my pan...(I didn't and the crinkles stuck to the pan like glue!), (2) I should put approximately 1.5-2 inches space between the choco balls coz they will expand during baking, (3) preparation can get a little messy so put a newspaper underneath for easier cleanup. I liked this recipe a lot.

It tastes a lot like a ball of cocoa. But if you like cocoa (as we do), these are great cookies.  I rolled them in regular granulated sugar and it burned on the bottom, but this was my fault.  Otherwise, they were really great cookies, and very unusual in that they kept their spherical shape.

Made this recipe on a snow day with my six year old. Did a recipe search for a recipe without butter since we didn't have any and this is one recipe that popped up. These cookies are sooo good! We were pleasantly surprised, very pretty, and moist in the middle. I did not chill for 4 hours, we couldnt wait that long, and only chilled the dough for a 1/2 hour and they were pretty pretty easy to work with. I did not use parchment paper either, just sprayed a little PAM on the cookie sheet and they came right off, no problem.

I've tried several different "Chocolate Crinkle" recipes and this one is by far the best! Crispy & crunchy on the outside, cake-like on the inside, AND---VERY CHOCOLATELY!!! (The cocoa powder makes a better dough than melted chocolate.) It's like a brownie in a cookie. YUM!

I made these cookies for my soccer team to celebrate our last game. I didn't have ANYTHING in the house, but even my pantry could withstand these cookies! They were quick and easy. My team loved them, and all 65 cookies were gone within 2 minutes. They are dense and fudgy, rather like a brownie bite, and get better with age. Thanks for this great recipe!

This turned out perfectly. I loved it! But I have to agree with the other reviews that it didn't yield 6 dozen. I made mine really small and it only went up to 5 dozen. Still loved it though. ;o)

This would be a great recipe to make with young children. Mine are teenagers now but my 16 year old and I had great fun plopping the dough in the confectioners sugar and then rolling into balls. I made them a bit bigger than called for and do space them out well as I didn't realise how much they would spread and could have done with a bit more space. Cooked for ten minutes and they are a bit like a brownie and  so pretty. My 14 year old has been calling them zebra cookies. Great fun will make again thanks.

These are the best cookies ever! They look really pretty with the crinkled top. Taste chewy like brownies. I added some chopped walnuts and chocolate chips. I put them in the freezer for approx. 45 minutes and they were fine. Easy to make and really yummy.

Thought they could be more chocolatey, perhaps adding some chocolate chips or chunks would help.  However, these are very addictive and tasty.

Only made one change.  Added 1 tsp of peppermint extract in place of the vanilla.  Baked for 10 minutes, and they came out like a moist, chewy brownie.  The Best!!

Great recipe!  I used both the original and a variation (left out the powedered sugar and mixed in chocolate chunks) and served these as part of the bruch buffet I bake each week.  I got rave reviews both from my chef and the customers.  
A  Little note:  I made huge batches and froze some and kept some in the fridge to use each week. The dough held up great for about a month both ways.

Everybody loves this recipe. If you want it chewy try baking it for 12 to 15 mins. If you want a softer shell bake it for 10 mins. This is a big hit. Thanks for posting this recipe

Delish! Very fudgey cookie. I also used red and green sugar in with the powdered sugar to make these "Christmas Cookies." Definitely cook them for only 8 minutes for a soft cookie. Some people seem to have problems with sticky dough, but I didn't have that problem, after refrigerating it for barely the 4 hours. I don't like using parchment paper since I don't keep it on hand and used cooking spray on the sheets, which worked out fine for me. Thanks for the yummy recipe Ingrid!

These are fantastic and are now a standard Christmas recipe in my box.  I had to make an extra batch because my daughter and I kept eating them and there weren't enough left for my gift boxes and platters.  They melt in your mouth and they aren't even that fattening!  What more could a woman want... lowfat chocolate!!!  Thanks.

these were very good. easy to mix in a mixmaster. mixed one night, baked the next. the chilled dough worked fine using a melon baller. once it hit the powdered sugar it wasn't too sticky to work with. i don't know how anyone would get 72 cookies though. i didn't make mine big and i got 48. put this one in your recipe box though.

This was so much fun and very easy. The trick with the dough is to use a cookie dropper... it looks like a mini icecream scoop. These make great Christmas cookies!

TIP: This dough, as with all crinkle cookie dough, is very sticky. That's why they are so moist! Use wax paper to pick up teaspoon size clumps (or spray two spoons with cooking spray), and drop right in the powdered sugar. When you have a few in the bowl, use a spoon (or your hands) to cover them with the powdered sugar in the bowl. Then pick them up individually and roll into balls. Works great!!!!!!!!! No sticky hands.
I must admit I like the crinkles made with unsweetened chocolate bars instead powdered cocoa.

Excellent.  Easy.  My kids love to make these.  I used to make these as a kid and would skip the chilling step--Don't!--the dough is impossible to handle if it isn't cold.  (You can can cheat and put it in the freezer for two hours to speed things up.)  I made this recipe as-is about 6 times and decided the cookie texture is a bit granular.  I now measure the white sugar into the blender and pulverize it first so it's finer.  It makes the end product smoother and fudgier.  (Confectioner's sugar would probably work, too, in the main recipe, but I don't know how much you'd put in.)

I also like to substitute mint extract for the vanilla and roll them in granulated sugar to change things up a bit.  I've also pushed mini candy kisses into the hot baked cookie, like a peanut blossom.

I was looking for a recipe that called used cocoa powder instead of melted unsweetened chocolate and this version of chocolate crinkles didn't disappoint.  These soft, chewy cookies taste great!  Thanks, Ingrid.

All the cookies were gone as soon as they came out of the oven.  These cookies are moist, soft, chewy and very fudgy.  They taste just as good cooled as they do warm from the oven.  Yumm!  As a once a week cookie baker, I know these cookies are Fantastic.

I love this cookie. I substituted the vegetable oil with coconut oil. I must have expired baking powder because my first batch of cookies did not spread at all, they stayed about the same size as when I put them on the tray. Second batch came out a little more spread out. Not sure if I have to let the batter come to room temperature or not or if the substitution doesnt mix well with the other ingredients or if the baking powder is expired. Regardless, a great cookie. Will make again.

These were delicious and a big hit at our family Christmas get-together.  Even after refrigeration the dough was a bit sticky so I rubbed a few drops of vegetable oil on my hands for easier handling.  The end result was cookies that were soft but not too soft and chocolaty but not too chocolaty.

These came out great, and all of the kids in my son’s class loved them. I made 72, and none of them made it home from school.

I started to make these, and then I realized I didn’t have enough cocoa powder. The recipe calls for sugar and cocoa in a 2:1 ratio. It occurred to me that hot chocolate mix is roughly the same ratio, and I happened to have a large container of it, so I replaced the sugar and cocoa with equal amounts of Ghirardelli Hot Chocolate Mix.

It was amazing! So soft and gooey! What I did was rolled them in granulated sugar, baked them, dipped half of them in melted coating chocolate, and then sprinkled crushed peppermint candy canes on the chocolate. So good!

I love these cookies. My daughter has a similar recipe, but this one is just as good and so much easier. They bake up soft and almost like brownies with that wonderful crackle affect. I did what another reviewer suggested. I rolled half of the cookies in powdered sugar and half in granulated sugar before baking. When they came out of the oven, I let the cookies rolled in granulated sugar cool for about a minute, then set a candy ‘kiss’ firmly on top of each cookie. Both versions were delicious and you would never guess that the cookie base were the same recipe. Great idea! Two cookies with one recipe.

I made these and decided to try baking them without refrigerating them and they baked perfectly!  Also, instead of doing it with 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and one teaspoon of peppermint extract, I did 1 1/2 teaspoon of peppermint and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla. They were amazing! Great recipe!

I made the recipe as printed with one small but important exception. When rolling the cookies, drop them in granulated sugar first, then into the confectioner's sugar. It keeps the confectioner's sugar from disappearing into the cookie and the granulated sugar is not noticeable. It leaves the cookies beautifully white and crackled.

These taste like the edge of the brownie, which in my opinion, is the best part. The recipie  makes a lot of cookies and I will definitely be making these again. They are delicious!

I made this for a ladies night that included one dairy-free, gluten-free individual.  I wanted them to be chocolate death, thin mint flavored so I substituted 3/4 cup 100 % Cacao (Hershey's special dark) and 1/4 regular, added 1/3 cup dark chocolate chips, two tsp of peppermint extract in place of the vanilla, and used gluten-free all purpose flour that had xanthan gum. I put dark hershey's kisses on some of them right after taking them out of the oven. Decadent and delicious. Tips: Split the dough in two since it warms quickly, freezing makes handling easier than refrigerating, and if you have a partner, one of you can gather the balls, drop it into the sugar and the other can roll in sugar and plop it on the cookie sheets. That's fast and easy with less warming of the dough. Note, there's a small amount of dairy in the chocolate chips and kisses so it's more minuscule dairy than dairy-free this way.

Very good! I followed the recipe exactly. I changed the coating procedure a bit based on what I read from America’s Test Kitchen. They suggest coating with granulated sugar first and then powdered sugar. They say it helps the tops dry better and creates a crust. I think they’re right. Mine turned out really good with great cracks, nice crust and soft middles. I will make again!

These cookies were just awesome. I was looking for a budget-friendly way to relieve a major sweet tooth, and these cookies killed it. Simple, sweet, long lasting softness (very similar to a brownie), and so aesthetically pleasing. The only changes I made were to half the recipe and add a 1/4 tsp of baking soda to combat the acidity of the cheap baking cocoa I was using. I also allowed the dough to chill for five hours and also, once each cookie-ball was formed, dusted, and on the baking sheet, put the sheet of cookies into the freezer for an extra quick chill while the oven pre-heated. Next time I'll probably skip the powdered sugar dusting because while it is what gives a crinkle it's distinct appearance, it does result in a pretty good mess that just doesn't suit the private snacking for which these cookies were intended.

Here's a trick for making these cookies: DO NOT roll the dough into balls first! Instead, pour the confectioners' sugar into a pie pan, and then drop teaspoon-sized pieces of dough into the sugar. (You can scoop and drop several pieces of dough at a time into the sugar.) Pick up each piece of dough and roll it around in the confectioners' sugar as you gently shape it into a ball. Your fingers will be "floured" with the confectioners' sugar, which keeps the dough from clinging and makes it MUCH easier than trying to form balls first with the sticky dough! Also recommend using a dark cocoa to intensify the chocolate flavor.

This is just like my recipe from 40 years ago with these exceptions. 1 1/2 cup cocoa versus 2 cups and mine calls for the addition of 1/2 cube of butter.  Excellent cookies.  Always a hit in my house.  I chill dough over night.

This was a great cookie recipe for any time of year.  Made recipe as written except I used 1/2 cup of plain applesauce instead of vegetable oil as I do with most of my recipes. I put dough in refigerator overnight. First, I made only 9 cookies to test the baking time and to see the result. I put the batter back in the refrigerator while the first batch was cooking.  The first batch spread more than I thought they should. Even before I put them in the oven they were already spreading. I watched the video to see if my dough was consistent with the person in the video.  Mine was softer. I tried putting the cookie sheets, ice cream scoop, smaller dish of batter that I was working with, along with the larger bowl of dough in the refrigerator. They still spread more than they should have. Mine were flatter than the picture but still had crinkles. I dropped them directly in the powdered sugar. I tried not to handle them.  I put the pan on the second shelf of oven while baking. They were very delicious. Maybe it was the applesauce but it never effected other cookies before. Maybe I should try putting them in the freezer instead of the refrigerator. I will try the recipe again. There are so many reviews it must be me. The batch made 47 cookies and I baked them for 10 minutes.

Yummy. I made a half batch which made 30 cookies. 11-12 minutes bake time. I found my dough a little dry so I saw it as an opportunity to add a tbsp of espresso. I chilled the dough overnight. I used a small spring loaded scoop for the dough and dropped them into a shallow bowl filled with confectioners sugar. Easy and mess free. I tried rolling a few in hazelnut flour. Double yum. I used parchment and a couple stuck, but nothing major. I used my gluten free flour blend, which worked great. I am always happy to find a good butterless cookie recipe. Will make again.

I followed the recipes exactly ingredients wise, ended up leaving it in the fridge for 24 hours before I actually made them, and they were delicious! A definite thumbs up from the family...with a fudgy, dark chocolate taste, these will be taken to future parties!

This is one of the best cookies I've ever made (and I've made a lot!). I agree with other reviewers...the flavor and texture is very much like a brownie. I added mini semi-sweet chocolate chips and can't imagine these without them. The chips added the perfect little bit of intense chocolate flavor that complimented the rest of the cookie (I think they would be too plain without the chips).  I used Hershey's Special Dark cocoa powder and added an extra 1/2 tspn of vanilla. 

To get 70 cookies, you have to use a very small scoop (I used the larger end of my double melon baller and got about 70). I think that was a great size for this cookie. They were small but didn't look like mini cookies. 

To deal with the super sticky dough, I pushed the dough out of the melon baller with my finger directly into a bowl of powdered sugar and then coated all of the sides before picking it up and rolling it into a ball in my hand. This worked well but I still had sticky fingers but they're worth it. I can't wait to make them again!

If you like dark chocolate here is your newest sensation. For some it may be tasteless, but I enjoy the simplicity and beauty. If you don't want to chill for 4 hours, cover with aluminum foil and freeze for 15 min.

They look really pretty and appetizing, but the chocolate flavor just kind of fell flat.  I used Hershey's coco powder fresh from the store that day.  They just weren't as chocolaty and decadent as they looked.

The recipe on its own is good, and if u make it without any changes to the recipe you wont go wrong.  My only issue is that after a few days the cookies aren't as soft as when they were first baked.  You have to let it chill for at least 4 hours or else you wont develop the flavor and the chocolate wont intensify.  

Second time around i made it,  I altered the recipe in my quest to make sure the cookie stayed soft.  I altered it based on another recipe i found.  I changed the oil to butter and melted it,  changed the 2 cups of sugar to 3/4 cup of white sugar and 3/4 cup of brown sugar and add a teaspoon of instant coffee. Best decision i've ever made.  I am so addicted to the cookies after i made the changes and even my boyfriend finished about 20 cookies in 2 days and after 4 days they were still just as soft as when they were first baked and did not dry out. Also made sure I stored it in a ziploc bag.  

There are so many alterations u can do with this cookie recipe and its great for experimentation.  I did also make it with reese's peanut butter chips and was a great peanut butter and chocolate cookie. Next i am going to experiment with rolling it in cinnamon sugar. Try the recipe out,  its good.  Plus it doesn't require alot of dishes,  which is always a plus in my book.

great recipe overall. couple things- I used a stand mixer with paddle attachment, with the exception of mixing dry ingredients, which I used a whisk for. I added 2 ounces of chopped 85% baking chocolate to the wet mixture before adding eggs. I used olive oil for veg oil and added a little bit more vanilla to balance out the extra chocolate. I made bigger cookies and baked for 16 minutes. only refrigerated for about 2.5 hours in a stainless steel bowl. came out perfect. I did three dozen in three batches. be generous with the confectioners sugar and use a fairly high rack in your oven. can't stop eating these cookies!

Woooohooo!! What an amazing recipe. Came out perfect! So chocolatey and so delicious. The only couple changes I made - 1) used butter as I like to bake with butter only - no issues. My batter was probably thicker than would have been with oil but caused no issues and the cookies are still fudgey and delicious. 2) Next time I will reduce the sugar in the dough. I may have coated my cookies too well to get a nice crinkle but it caused them to be a little too sweet for my taste. Such a satisfying baking experience! :)

Awesome recipe. Added 4 ounces of melted, unsweetened baker's chocolate. Found that with it, it made a thick dough that didn't require refrigeration to form. Delicious.

Halving the recipe yielded 24 cookies with a little extra dough (for taste testing, of course!). Oh my, these are absolutely delicious! I could not stop eating them. They had a soft, fudgey texture, not overly chewy or anything like that.  I added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips (halved the recipe) for an extra chocolatey boost. It's a lot easier to scoop some dough up, drop it into the sugar, and then roll it, otherwise your hands will be a huge mess. Such a fantastic recipe!

I made a half batch because I only had 2 eggs and I wish I could have made a whole batch! My boyfriend who isn't a big chocolate fan even loved these. I only chilled for 2 hours in the fridge and didn't use parchment paper and they still turned out perfect!

I made some delicious cookies with the guidance of this recipe. Things I change: 3 eggs, added 1/4 cup of ground almonds & placed dough in freezer for about 3 hours. Yum!!

Gosh these are scrumptious!!! I put the dough in the freezer for 45 minutes instead of four hours in the fridge as I was in a hurry to eat them and they turned out just fine. I also used a greased cookie sheet instead of parchment. This recipe is definitely worth a keeper .

These came out great! I refrigerated the batter for 4 hours as indicated in the recipe. It was still sticky but I continued with it anyway. The stickiness was actually good for getting a good coating of powdered sugar, if you don't mind dealing with the mess. They still held a nice ball shape on the cookie sheet. I lined the sheet with parchment paper and they had no trouble sticking. I baked for 11 minutes and let them cool on the sheet. They seemed fragile coming out of the oven, but firmed up enough to put on a tray and transport. I added a Tablespoon of instant espresso to the batter that gave a nice mocha flavor. They had a nice soft brownie-like texture inside. My husband could not stop eating them!

I thought I followed the recipe to the letter, but mine did not turn out like the other reviewers described. They tasted okay - sort of like brownies, but the consistency of my dough (after it chilled overnight) was like silly putty, and they did not spread at all when they baked. I would rather have spent less time making a pan of brownies. Sorry, but I won't be making them again.

This is an outstanding cookie.  The texture and flavor is perfect. They are somewhat like a brownie in cookie form. I can't imagine making these without using a small melon baller, though.  These cookies make a nice presentation. I used a whole cup of confectioners sugar for coating and I baked them for 11 minutes and left them on the cookie sheet for an additional minute as per instructions.  They store well in an airtight container with parchment between layers and taste even better the following day.

I didn't have time to let the dough chill but they still came out fabulous. I bit hard to handle (thus why chilling is recommended) but couldn't be happier with how they turned out!

These are great...for the novice (like me), a 50 whatever spoon is NOT a tablespoon size...I used a tablespoon and got half the cookies...go smaller...these are nice and rich, almost brownie like.  also, the recipe doesn't say electric mixer...saw that in the video after I made the batter...that would have been handy up front.  my forearms are talking to me after mixing it by hand.   Great recipe and will do again...smaller...and with an electric mixer.  Enjoy!

I followed the recipe exactly and they came out delicious! The dough IS very sticky no matter what, but dropping it directly in the sugar and then rolling it into balls worked beautifully. I took another reviewer's advice and baked them 2 inches from the heat and they crackled nicely.

Uh oh.  I have 1 very big cookie.  And FLAT as a pancake.  I'm not sure what I did wrong but, the don't look like pictures (plump). They, or should I say "it" crackled fine and is chewy. I agree with another review I read, almost to chocolate .

So chocolatey, delicious, and IMPRESSIVE looking! 
I used Hershey's Special Dark cocoa. Didn't chill the dough, but did scoop and drop into the powdered sugar - easier to handle. SPRAY the pan. Bake NO MORE than 10 min! They look puffy and slightly undercooked. But when they settle and cool, they are very moist and chewy bites of chocolate heaven! The fam ate half before they made it to the jar!

I've tried this recipe a total of 3 times. I am in the middle of the third try, but for some reason, it's much thicker than before. In the previous two tries, the batter was very thin, and only hardened up after it cooled, but this time, it's a lot thicker, almost to dough(but still really sticky). Does anybody know why? Also, the first two times, I halved the recipe.

I tried this recipe for the first time tonight.  I have never eaten or seen this cookie before but found it while perusing the site for some new chocolate desserts.  I need to make a variety of chocolate desserts  for a chocolate and champagne event I do at my home in December and this looked very snowy and good for the season. It also looked pretty easy and I had all the ingredients on hand so I decided to give them a try. I refrigerated the dough for 4-5 hours. 

I can't believe I have baked for so many years and never come across these cookies.  They were so easy and came out so perfectly. I baked them for 15 minutes and that was just right for my oven. I ended up with 4 dozen instead of 6 so that is probably why mine took a little longer. I put parchment on the cookie sheets and could lift off easily with my hand. No sticking at all. 

I made the first two batches exactly according to the recipe and then added a handful of chocolate chips and macadamia nuts to the last two.  Both were very good but really do taste like a cake-like brownie. 

I have had a lot of trouble lately with my cookies going flat so I was delighted that they kept their mounded shaped.  I rolled the balls in quite a bit of powdered sugar and it stayed on beautifully  making the perfect affect. They looked just like in the pictures.

Ran out of white sugar so had to use mostly brown sugar in the recipe.  I also substituted 2-3 Tb of black cocoa for part of the cocoa powder to make it extra chocolaty. Dough was like brownie batter so I put in freezer for a few hours and then it was fine to scoop & roll in powdered sugar.  They turned out great, everyone loved them. Best part is that the dough is perfect for freezer because it stays soft so there's no need to thaw it out - just scoop & roll.

Even after I refrigerated it for 6 hours, it was still gooey. Even so, I dropped the dough into the confectioner's sugar and rolled it there. They came out perfect. Slightly crunchy on the outside and soft inside. After they were cooled, I sprinkled the cookies with confectioner's sugar again since my family loves eating them messy. I wonder if this recipe is also good as red velvet crinkles if added red food coloring?

Made them exactly to recipe. They we're gone in no time! The melon baller method doesn't work- it gets clogged up with dough too fast. I use a spoon and coat my hands with Pam spray. They turned out gorgeous.

Awesome cookies!  I used Hershey's Cocoa and added about 1 cup of Ghiardelli mini chocolate chips to the batter.  Rich chocolate flavor. Crispy outer layer with brownie like inner cookie.  Very pretty to serve and give as a gift. Please do refrigerate the dough for a few hours before forming the balls and rolling in confectioner's sugar.  It makes for much easier handling. I made my cookies slightly larger and got 45 from the batch.  I baked for 11 minutes on second oven rack from the top.  Perfect!

These looked nice, but the flavor was bland and the texture was really odd. I hoped for a texture like a brownie, but got something so airy that it floated in the glass of milk - even after several minutes. I also thought rolling them was very sticky work - more sticky than I remember this type of cookie being. Finally, they didn't flatten during baking. I had to flatten them with the bottom of a glass before baking. I also found that baking them eight minutes was still a little too long. Ten minutes was definitely too long in my oven.

This has been a favorite of mine since I was a kid! We like to substitute Mint extract for the Vanilla around the holidays!

Not a baker at all.  Super easy to make. I used the tips that I read. After making the dough I put it in the freezer instead if the fridge, much faster.  I also dropped the dough right into the sugar so that helped with the stickiness as well.  Parchment paper is a must.

If my son rated this cookie, he would have given it a 5-star. I only gave it a 4 because of the sweetness. Really, really sweet for me. Otherwise, it was like a chewy brownie. I did like that!

WOW! Wonderful recipe. I followed the recipe and they turned out great. I dropped the tsp. of batter in the sugar, pushed it a little with tip of the spoon to coat, then rolled with my hands - no mess! I also think it's important to point out, after reading some reviews of the cookies not being "all that", that you need to use high quality ingredients! My cookies came out so tasty, that I can't imagine anyone rating these anything but 5* Use good quality cocoa! These are soft, and dense like a brownie, rich in flavor and addicting!

amazing flavor and texture; make sure to use LOTS of powder sugar to acheive a slightly crunchy outer coat. I also found that chilling the dough overnight made it rise up more.

Followed the recipe and the cookies had great flavor and were moist. I did keep the dough in the fridge between baking and I baked them longer-14 minutes.

These cookies are spectacular. The only thing that I did that was not specified, I used half Crisco and half liquid vegetable oil. These cookies turned out very moist. They taste like high quality brownies that look pretty.

I made this recipe for a Christmas cookie exchange and I loved the way they turned out. I made the dough the day before and it was really easy to work with. I used 1 tsp of peppermint extract and eliminated the vanilla so the cookies had a subtle minty flavor which was just right. Thanks for sharing ~ this recipe was very easy and absolutely delicious.

Best cookies ever.  Sooo very very delicious.  The only changes I made were to add miniature chocolate chips.  I left the dough in the freezer for an hour and used a small cookie scoop for uniform size, I also coated in icing sugar, rolled the dough and then rerolled in icing sugar.  Came out perfect.

Came out pretty good! I ended up freezing the batter for 45 min and then since I wasn't quite ready to make them, I ended up refrigerating for another hour or so. They really weren't that hard to handle using a spoon to put them in the sugar. They overlook easily so watch closely.

I love chocolate crinkles, and this was my first attempt at making them. I got a bit worried when, after 12 minutes of baking, the cookies were still very soft, but as they cooled they solidified and were just great! The outside is a bit crunchy while inside it's fudgy and chewy. I had to put the plate away to stop myself from eating too much. 

I greased my pan instead of using parchment paper, and it turned out fine. I also froze the batter for about an hour, as I live in a hot and humid country and I was scared of having runny batter. Next time I'll try the advice of another reviewer and put some dark chocolate.

These are delicious!  I substituted coconut oil instead of vegetable oil to make them non-GMO and they turned out delicious.  We put them in the freezer for 45 mins. as many people recommended, but it broke my cookie scoop!  We just rolled the rest by hand.  Great recipe!

This is a very tasty recipe.  Even after 4 hours in the refrigerator, the dough is still sticky and hard to deal with.  I found that wetting my hands made it a little easier.  Next time I might substitute spearmint for the vanilla.

Cake-like and chocolatey - very nice!  I agree with others - don't skimp on the powdered sugar.  I actually put another little scoop on top once they were on the cookie tray before cooking.

Very good! Went fast at our Christmas french club meeting, and at my house. Some people called them "brownie cookies". Relatively easy, used silicone baking mats and baked at the top of the oven as one reviewer suggested and it worked like a charm. I also used dutch process for about 2/3 of the cocoa. Great cookie to have on hand for Christmas!

These might be the best cookie I have ever made! I followed the recipe exactly but I used my stand mixer for everything, adding the flour in thirds to prevent drying out the cookies. I scooped the dough straight into the powdered sugar and they rolled right up with no sticky hands. I baked them at the top of the oven and they crinkled beautifully. I can't wait to show them off at my cookie exchange!

Made these and followed the tweaks for the second upper rack in the oven.  I left the dough in the fridge over night, no rush to bake them.  The dough was perfect for rolling in the powdered sugar, no problems at all.  Used parchment paper, always use it.  I have 3 pans on the go at once, take one out and put one in.  You can use the same piece of parchment for the for all the baking time, they did not stick at all.  I used the Ghiradelli cocoa and added dark chocolate mini chunks gave it amazing chocolate flavour.  They were a huge hit and they freeze well.  Making them again this week.  two thumbs up!!!!!

These are FANTASTIC!   I have always loved crinkle cookies, just had never made them myself.  I was looking for a little chocolate fix earlier this week, and didn't have too many things in the pantry to work with, but I had almost enough cocoa powder to make 1/4 of this recipe.  They turned out absolutely amazing.  I took the advice of another reviewer and stuck the batter in the freezer for about 25 minutes (didn't take long with a small batch), but they were not sticky at all when I rolled them and threw them in the powdered sugar.  Aside from not having any whole eggs, so I had to sub egg whites, I followed the recipe exactly, they crinkled perfectly in the oven, and they are now my new favorite cookies to make!  I love so much that they don't contain any butter and very little oil.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

this recipe has made so many people begging for more! my nephew's all time favourite... so simple and straight forward.

I have been playing around with this recipe for a long time and for a healthier choice, i use half a cup less of sugar and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and the cookies turned out just as good.

Also, i hate waiting so i just put the mixture in the freezer for 45-60 mins instead of chilling it for full 4 hours.

This recipe is delicious! While everyone raved about them, I personally found them a tiny bit dry. However, they are fudgy, moist, and overall, delicious! I took these to a cookie exchange, 2 dozen cookies to maybe 10-12 people, and there wasn't a crumb left when I went home! Thank you for a wonderful recipe, I'll be using this again and again!

Great recipe! Don't understand the amount of failures in the reviews. It's absolutely imperative that this dough be chilled before balling and rolling in powdered sugar. That means even putting the dough back in the refridgerator between batches. Otherwise, these come out picture perfect for me!

IF YOU DON'T CHILL THE BATTER, THEY WON'T WORK!  :)


(if you're matching my photo with the review, I show both, the failed and the good cookies in my photo.  One difference on the 'good' cookies was that I used Hershey Special Dark coco on the good ones whick made them extra pretty).


Sad but true.  I made two batches of these in two days.  The first batch I was impatient and didn't chill the batter well.  They were awful.  They came out flat and had the miserable yellowish looking powdered sugar like others have complained about.  I threw them out and immediately made another batch.  Put it in the fridge overnight and rolled and cooked them the following day.  PERFECT and just beautiful as they should be!!  Don't take short cuts here because you will be disappointed!  By the way, they are so delicious and taste like little Brownies!

Wow. These were amazing. Some of the best cookies I have ever made, and I was very skeptical because they don't use butter. I skipped the confectioner's sugar and topped with 1/2 a candied cherry for Christmas. They came out pretty, delicious, and perfectly chewy. They taste a lot like a chewy brownie. MMMMMM! Someone please keep me from eating all of them!

Turned out great!  Followed recipe exactly except used mint extract in place of vanilla for a minty taste!  Chilled dough for 3 hours and that was plenty.  Used the idea to drop right from spoon into powdered sugar and then used the sugar to help prevent sticking.  Worked great.  Looked great!  Tasted great!

The whole family loved them!  If you like brownies...you will like these.  They are like little bite sized brownies.  I followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfectly.  Thanks for the recipe...it is a keeper at my house!

I really liked these.  They are sort of like a donut cookie. I added a tbsp of coffee (you don't taste the coffee, it just brings out the chocolate flavor), and just a tad more cocoa powder and flour to compensate the extra liquid.  I also used half regular sugar and half brown sugar (not sure if it makes a huge difference - it's what I had on hand - but I've heard brown sugar could give a richer flavor to the chocolate as well). Greased my pans, froze the cookie dough for 40 minutes, and dropped spoonfuls directly into the powdered sugar and then used my hands to roll them around, and there was no mess or sticky dough on my hands. Everyone enjoyed them.

I was looking for a dairy-free cookie recipe because we had friends coming over who have allergies.  This is one of the best cookies I've ever had - it tastes like a moist, fudgy brownie.  And it stays fresh for days!

Amazing cookies!. Made these numerous times and this has always been a crowd-pleaser. I suggest adding a tsp of strong coffee or instant espresso powder to bring out the chocolate flavor. I also like to add 1/2 of almond extract sometimes and reduce the vanilla. I know it sounds weird but people really seem to love that combination! Also after many trials and errors, I have found that the secret to getting these to crinkle beautifully lies in how  you press them down. You really need to refrigerate for at least an hour. I use a larger melon baller to get perfect bite-size cookies. Coat them a thick layer of powder sugar and shake the excess off gently. then only press them down slightly with your thumb, not too much. This way they spread more while baking and thus you get a nicer crinkle.

Good recipe. I used the advice of another and lightly oiled the pan and it worked great. I also didn't have time for them to chill, so I put them I n the freezer for 5 minutes then spooned them onto the sheet, and sprinkled the powder sugar on. Worked out well.

This cookie is enough to satisfy any chocolate craving.  Followed the recipe as is but didn't level the cocoa in the measuring cup, so maybe added about 1/8 of a cup more than recipe calls for.  Froze dough for about an hour and put it back in the freezer after filling up a cookie sheet.  Used a scoop to scoop the dough into the confectioners surge which was a time saver and kept my hands pretty clean.  Had to bake the cookies for 15 minutes.  The first batch I put in for 12 and they were raw in the middle, had to toss them.  The ones baked for 15 minutes were a keeper.  Can't wait to make this recipe again.

I don't normally write reviews here, but this was an exception. Made these for the first time and they came out perfectly.  I halved the recipe since I wasn't sure if my family would like them.  Even then, I didn't have but 3/4 white sugar so I made up the 1 C of white sugar by adding 1/4 c brown sugar.  These cookies are amazing. My husband just announced this is the very best cookie I have ever made.  Thank you Ingrid!

Just as good as I remember from my childhood.  Kids were adamant that I rate this 12 stars.  Extremely rich and hits the sweet tooth right where it counts.  Since I had no idea what a #50 scoop was,  I used a 1tblsp scoop to make mine and ended up with 27 cookies, so next time, I know to use a smaller scoop.

My mom absolutely loved them, but I am a harsh rater. I made a different recipe before these and this was definitely a 5 star cookie compared to them. But, I love rich, chocolate, sugary desserts, and this was good. But, wasn't sweet enough, or have enough chocolate. Next time, I would add the extra chocolate.
But, this recipe is definitely worth trying, and you can make it your own.

Amazing cookie, though mine only made 4 dozen (just barely!), not 7 dozen like it said! Also make sure to cover the whole ball in icing sugar, so you can see the cracks.

Just baked this yesterday, followed the recipe to a T and they were awesome! Crunchy outside, light and chewy inside. They came out perfect!  Since I was using a mini electric oven the baking time was a little longer but worth the wait. Keeping this recipe. Lacking of a star because I just felt the proportions were just a little too small for the servings.

Don't freak out after you mix your ingredients, you wind up with a batter- you did nothing wrong!  The batter will harden to a dough-like consistency after a few hours, coat your fingers with powdered sugar when you roll the little balls to minimize how much the dough sticks to your fingers.

I love them, I make two batches every christmas, one with milk chocolate chips and one without, freezing the dough helps with the rolling process because the dough is so sticky, also for those who say the powdered sugar makes them stick, DO NOT press them down on the baking sheet. I use nothing but a plain baking pan and they do not stick at all.

Impressive looking and great tasting.  Super easy.  Small changes...added 1 teaspoon of peppermint extract, only one teaspoon of vanilla, added 3/4 cup of milk chocolate chips, used non-stick tin foil instead of parchment, baked for 15 minutes.  Used a tablespoon measurement ice cream scoop to measure out the dough.  Big fluffy cookie.  SO SO SO good.  Please try these cookies, you will not be sorry.

These are the PERFECT Crinkle recipe and SO easy! They only take a little patience when it comes to letting them chill for 4 hours before baking. Next time, I'm going to try adding some instant coffee to the mix and creating a little Mocha Crinkle!

HELP! I did something wrong. After letting it chill (covered, in the fridge) for probably 16 hours or so, the batter was just that: batter. It didn't really form a ball very well and when I placed them on the cookie sheet they flattened out pretty quickly. Plus, by the time I finished "rolling" each one in the sugar, those that had been done previously had absorbed all their sugar. They taste okay - nothing special - but they look like pancakes. I made them for my son's birthday celebration at school as he has a classmate who is allergic to dairy and these seemed like a good fit. I'll still send them (4-year-olds aren't that picky) but if anyone can tell me what I did wrong, I'd love to know because I suspect this is a fantastic recipe when done right.

I followed the recipe exactly except I put the dough in the freezer for 45 minutes.  I just took a spoonful of dough, dropped it into a bowl of powdered sugar, rolled it in the bowl until covered, and then in my hands.  I had no issues with sticking doing it this way.  Also, to grease the cookie sheets I sprayed Pam down the center of the sheet and then used my fingers to spread it around the entire cookie sheet.  This left the perfect amount.  My cookies did not go flat like others mentioned and turned out beautifully.  I had no problems with the cookie sticking to the cookie sheet either.  I don't get the "not chocolately enough" comments as  I think they are fabulous!  Just a matter of personal preference I guess.

Not only are these yummy and rich, but super easy as well. The best part is almost everyone will have all the ingredients on hand to make them at any time. I don't even refrigerate my dough for 4 hours. I put it in the freezer just long enough for it to be handled without making a mess. That way I can have rich, chocolatey cookies for me and the hubby in a flash! Love it!

Very cute and simple to make (besides shaping each ball......a tad time consuming).  I ran out of vegetable oil, so had to use olive oil.  It gave these a very strong olive taste, which I didn't like too much, but others seemed to love it.  thanks!

these cookies turned out great! Very moist and chewy and the crackle effect makes them look even more delicious. Like some other people suggested I added some mint extract (I love mint and chocolate) and some chocolate chips. The cookies came out looking exactly like the picture, but make sure you have a powerull mixer. The dough is very thick, but a lot easier to work with once its been chilled.

Delicious but they just didn't hold their shape and came out flat.  I tried adding more cocoa powder, putting it in the freezer and now I am going to try freezing the individual balls and cooking from frozen.  Perhaps the measurements just don't survive being converted into metric, perhaps my eggs were too big but it just didn't work.

These were quite good and easy to make. i did not refrigerate them for 4 hours, who has time for that? I just stuck them in the freezer as suggested maybe 30 min and they were fine to work with and came out perfect. Only complaint is they are just not chocolaty enough for me, maybe using choc chips would have added more flavor. Hubby loves them so they are a keeper anyhow.

Very yummy and easy. Followed the recipe exactly except I put the dough in the freezer for 45 min so I didn't have to wait the 4 hours. Like a cross between a brownie and a cookie, might try to add some chocolate chips next time.

Just like I remember them from childhood. SO YUMMY. Had to bake in my oven more like 12+ minutes...kind of hard to tell when they're done. I can handle them a little underbaked but hubby can't ;).

These were pretty good.  Very brownie-like and chewy, which is how I like my cookies.  The dough was really sticky (even after 4+ hrs in the fridge) and rolling them in powdered sugar was messy.  But worth it in the end.

Very good!  The chocolate crinkle is my favorite cookie from a local bakery.  While these aren't quite as good - they are a close second.  They "cracked" perfectly after I followed the advice of someone who wrote to put them on the top rack and cook them one baking sheet at a time.  The consistency was perfect - chewy and moist.  I'll make these again for sure.

I made this exactly as is for Christmas and everyone loved them! The only thing I did differently was I put the mix in the freezer for about 45 minutes instead of the fridge for 4 hours, much quicker.  I'll be making these again, but maybe with a little extra sugar in the mix, just a tad bitter for a cookie for my taste. Thanks Ingrid.

These cookies are amazing.  I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great.  They are rich and chocolately almost the consistancy of brownies.  I won't need to worry about where to store them because each time  someone passes the cooling racks in the kitchen they take another cookie. Will definately make these again.

I thought this was my mothers recipice from 1968 but I was wrong! They were not sweet enough.  The second batch I used 1.5 cups of cocoa, 2.5 cups of sugar, and 1/4 oil and 1/4 melted real unsalted butter.  YEAH! success

I followed all of the directions but cut the recipe in half. I Pammed the cookie sheets quite thoroughly and most of the cookies came off with just a little twist, not even needing the spatula. Most of them look great, although the oil that was on my hands absorbed and dulled the sugar in some places. I had to put the bowl back in the freezer between batches because the dough was starting to stick to my hands quite a bit. They all crinkled just right and they taste quite a bit like brownies, which is fine by me! My parents love them. They're so easy to make, and I'll definitely be making them again.

Just now I made them.  Everything is perfect. its sticky to your palm when rolling though, but u can get rid of this by rubbing C.sugar well in your palm and be generous in coating the balls well in the C.Sugar.  i got 60 cookies out of the same measurement. didnt change a bit.  its a kind of brownie.  hope this will the same taste on Christmas day!

These were EXCELLENT!  Followed the recipe completely, except for an addition of 2 tsp of instant espresso to the dough to enhance the chocolate flavor.  Baked these for 11 min, and they came out perfectly soft and chewy.  Tastes just like a little chocolate brownie from heaven!  Mmmmm, think I'll have another right now!

So good!!!    I made 2 versions of these: 1 with powdered sugar & the other with white sugar.  Both were delicious: the powdered sugar ones were nice and moist & the white sugar cookies ended up with a crunchy outside & fuggy center.  Next time I'm also going to try making these without any sugar topping & then turning them into chocolate woopi pies with frosting sandwiched between 2 cookies.

These aren't too sweet, have a nice flavor and light texture, but the confectioner's sugar melted into the cookies. In the spots where it remained, it took on a yellowish cast. I read on Martha Stewart's version of this recipe to roll the dough in granulated sugar before the powdered sugar, to make it adhere better. I don't know if it would work, but I would probably try that next time, if I make these again--though I will reduce the sugar a bit if I do coat with granulated sugar. Honestly, I probably won't bother to roll these cookies in anything next time.

These cookies are sooooo good.  I wanted to make a mint chocolate crinkle cookie after eating one at Panera.  I used this recipe but substituted half the vanilla for mint extract.  It was delicious...and not that minty, so substituting all of the vanilla is probably what I will do next time.  Super delicious and had a brownie texture when I cooked them for 11 1/2 minutes (using a size 40 scooper = 1 1/2 Tbsp).

Really liked these cookies. They are like a brownie/cake kind of cookie. My husband is not a brownie/choc. fan but he even liked these. Also a hit with friends that I gave them too. Would make again!!

These were great.  I followed other reviewers suggestions of adding peppermint extract for the holidays, freezing the dough for 45 minutes to make it easier to work with, and finally baking them on the second to the top rack so they would crack.  They turned out wonderful my boyfriend couldn't stop eating them :)  Thanks these will be added to the Christmas cookie list for next year too.

They came out perfect.  I only chilled the dough for about 2 hours and it was ok to handle.  Just a little sticky, otherwise they were great.  Thanks!

Delicious!  I used a small scoop and eliminated the stickiness/washing hands issue.  Plopped the dough balls right into a cereal bowl full of powdered sugar and swirled the bowl around to coat the dough.  Mine needed 12-14 minutes in the oven.  Beautiful!!  VERY SWEET.

These tasted great, but, as usual, my cookies were flat and ugly.  Not sure if it's my oven temp or the way I handle the dough?  Oh well, I suppose it just means I need to practice my technique with another batch of these asap!

Made according to recipe except made 21 large cookies. Baked 16 min. and let cool on cookie pans for about 5 min. These cookies are a 'wow' to look at and the texture and moisture are perfect. I counted down one star because they are more like cocoa crinkles than chocolate crinkles. I'm missing the rich chocolate taste, but I will be making these again with some modifications to improve the chocolate flavor.edit: tried enhancing chocolate flavor using 1 cup chocolate chips-don't do it! changed texture and appearance-third time I melt 4 oz. unsweetened chocolate with the oil and followed rest of directions and they were chocolate heaven!

The cookies turned out beautifully! Although the taste wasn't exactly what I was looking for, the presentation was great and it satisfied my chocolate craving. Popping them in the freezer first (a tip from other reviews) really helped. I also rolled mine in regular granulated sugar first before rolling them in powdered sugar; I find it helps the powdered sugar stick better.

Easy to make, long chilling time though.  Light and airy cookie, almost like a brownie.  Not as chocolaty tasting as I thought it would be.  May make some changes to make it richer tasting next time. Thanks for sharing.

After having crinkle cookies from Dahlia Bakery in Seattle, I've become obsessed with them.  I stumbled upon this recipe, which comes pretty darn close!  They are so fudgey, almost brownie-like, and SO GOOD!  I halved the recipe but otherwise followed it to a tee.  I may have made my balls too big, but it doesn't make 36 cookies, which ended up working out because I didn't want that many cookies to begin with.  This is going in the recipe box!

These are SO good! Slightly crisp on the outside, delicious and fudgey on the inside. Really like a brownie in cookie form...almost. I didn't have any problem with the dough being sticky or thin. I stuck it in the freezer for about an hour and a half and it was just fine to scoop. I used a medium sized cookie scoop and got 19 cookies from a half-batch. Also added some mini chocolate chips. Yum!

Great!  Followed the directions and they came out perfect - like little brownies!  I did make mine a little bigger.  I used my cookie scoop (which is about 1 1/2 Tbsp.) and got 3 dozen cookies.  I also added 1 tsp. peppermint extract.  The dough is very soft, but after refrigerating for a couple of hours, it wasn't too bad to work with.  Using my cookie scoop, I just dropped the dough right into the sugar.  It was then easy to work with after rolling in the sugar.

Tasty, chocolatey, chewy cookies. I loved how they were almost brownie-like. So easy to throw together - I popped the container in the freezer for about 2 hours and it worked just fine. Very pleased - great any time but I think it will be nice for Christmastime.

These are sooooo yummy!  I'm a cookie nightmare, but these turned out perfectly for me which makes them foolproof!  I only chilled the dough for an hour, then scooped and rolled in the powdered sugar, set on the cookie sheet and let them set in the fridge again until the oven was heated.  Cooked for 10 minutes and they were PERFECT, moist, chewy and crinkle-ey!  Yum!

Delicious brownie like cookies. Dairy Free too!  I put the dough in the freezer for 1/2 hour.  Worked great. Also followed another reviewers suggestion of putting the oven rack 2nd from top.

I thought these were good, not great.  My 10 year old son said they were good, but dry.  He wasn't thrilled with them.  I took them to a party with lots of kids and there were several left over at the end of the night.

Delicious. Definitely a party pleaser! My friend ate 12 in one sitting... disturbing. Not very sweet cookies, but the powdered sugar compensates for that.

I had to alter this a bit b/c of my son's allergies, the first batch came out sooo delicious (like mini soft brownie bites) but the second was a bit more dry- still good, but not as moist... this was probably due to my laterations, so I do think it is a good recipe...

These were great, I put the doug in the freezer for about 45 min.  I did not find them difficult to make.  I did add a tsp of espresso powder, that really brings out the chocolate flavor.  Wonderful cookie.

Wonderful!  Made exactly as directed.  They were very easy to put together and with ingredients I always have, which is a huge plus.  They were almost like a little individual brownie and were still nice and soft the next day.  My son said that these just might be the best cookies I have ever made, which is really saying alot.  Thank you so much for sharing this, Ingrid!

Perfection!  Used another reviewerer's tip and placed the oven rack second from the top and it turned out just right.  They're even better the second day because the cookie has time to "fall" and get more fudgy and dense (the first day they were a little airy).

Loved these cookies! I loved how they kind of tasted like a little brownie. I loved their presentation! The only thing that got me was the puff of powdered sugar I inhaled at the first bite. But it was worth it. Will make these again!

These were tasty, pretty and easy to make.  I put the dough in the freezer for about 45 min. and had no trouble rolling into balls.  To get the cookies coated in sugar, I used 2 small bowls and a few cookies in the bowl that had the sugar then dumped the whole thing in a second bowl and went back and forth a few times.  Piece of cake. I would have liked the cookies to have more chocolate flavor.  Maybe next time I will add chocolate liqueur or even more cocoa powder. The texture was wonderfully chewy on the inside, even after a few days. Thanks for the great recipe!

I was so excited to try these cookies after seeing the great reviews. I took the suggestion of adding a little peppermint extract. They were a little time consuming but I enjoyed making them. I was disapointed in the flavor. I felt that they were pretty bland. I used brand new high quality cocoa but I feel maybe it needed more? I took some over to my inlaws where I have a reputation for making delicious goodies. I was over there a week later and there was the container of cookies with quite a few left in there. They obviously didn't think they were all that delicious either. I won't be making these again, not with all the work that was involved.

I have never made this cookie before but I have eaten many of them. So today I got brave and with the help of all of the reviews here I made my first Chocolate crinkle cookies. This recipe was so easy. The two things I took out of the reviews that helped were the time the dough was chilled and how to bake them. This was key to making a perfectly chewy cookie. I split my dough in fourths and let it chilled for 4 hours and it was easier to roll into balls as long as I removed only a fourth of the dough at a time. The other was baking the cookies on the 2nd to the top rack. Ten minutes of baking was perfect in my oven. I will make these again....

Followed recipe exactly. Used a cookie scoop to make the balls, dropped in powder sugar - turned out perfect, no mess. Love these cookies! Sometimes I add walnuts - Yum!

SO YUM!! SO BRILLIANT!! SO CHRISTMASY n snowy and LOVELY!! I added 1 tsp of cinnamon to the dry ingredients to give it more of a flavor of the season. Apart from that I did exactly as the recipe stated except...I refrigerated the dough for about 2days before baking (coz I couldn't bake sooner) and I poped the dough back in the fridge after filling on baking sheet. Like anouther reviewer suggested, I took 1 inch balls and dropped them into icing sugar. rolled them and coated them well with sugar. instead of making them into balls and then dropping them into sugar, since they are sticky just drop them into the sugar let them coat and then form them into balls. Perfect. You simply can't go wrong! Just coat really well...they'l crack beautifully. Also they were done in about 11 minutes, after which I pulled them out and left them on the tray for about 2-3 mins and then transferred them onto wired racks. Thanks Ingrid! :)

I split the batter in half, and rolled half in confectioners, and the other half, I added some peppermint as noted in another review, and rolled in white sugar.  They're incredible and my family loves them!  Definitely a keeper!

These cookies are fabulous- moist, chewy, and so chocolaty. My family loves them! (We call them "Chocolate Kringles" at Christmas time!) The dough is very soft and is like cake batter- I freeze the dough for 45 minutes like another reader suggested and that really makes it easier to handle. When you're ready to roll them, drop the dough directly from your scoop or spoon into the confectioner's sugar, roll it around a little, and then roll into a ball with your hands. (I do this right over the sink, makes clean up easier!) Then, roll in the confectioner's sugar again to make sure you have enough sugar on them so they crinkle. Keep the dough in the fridge between batches, too, so it doesn't get too soft. Thanks for a great recipe, Ingrid- it's a keeper!!

Yum - these were great!  The dough was pretty sticky, even after the sit in the refrigerator.  Once I got a system down though, baking the wasn't so bad.  Thanks so much for this recipe!

These were excellent.  Moist and delicious.  I scooped out a tray full and then put the dough back in the fridge to harden up again.  It took a little bit longer since I made them in shifts but the dough is easier to work with when it is chilled.

These weren't bad, but they could be better. I put them in the freezer for 45 minutes instead of in the fridge and they were super easy to work with-but they got more sticky and fudge-ier the longer they were out, so work fast! Also, I think next time I make them I'll add chocolate chips or something. Oh, and I won't grease the cookie sheets-it ended up being a mess and seemed unnecessary. Nice and chewy on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside. It will be fun to mix these with our other holiday cookies.

I was grateful for all the suggestions. Mine didn't crinkle too much but they turned out great anyway. I used Hersheys Dark Special cocoa and they were really flavorful, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  If not using parchment, a good spatula for getting them off the cookie sheet is a must.

Just made these this evening and they are amazing! They turned out soft and chewy, just like I wanted, when I took them out of the oven at about 10.5 minutes. I used the hershey's "special dark" cocoa powder and added some semi-sweet choc chips to the batter.  Good thing I put some in the freezer or they might just be gone yet tonight.

Delicious! They taste like little brownies! The only change I made to the recipe was to use 3/4 of the called-for sugar instead of the full amount. They were a cinch to make, and I find it very confusing how so many people are having a runny batter with these cookies. I mean, there's hardly any liquid in them. The batter was very thick for me even before I refrigerated it overnight. I know I didn't mix it wrong because I made my first batch, then mixed up another half batch because I didn't think one was enough, and both came out the same consistency. (The 1.5 recipe yielded 75 cookies, by the way.) I coated the 1-inch cookie balls well with the powdered sugar and baked them on the second to top rack for 10 minutes. They came out perfect! So yummy!! Will definitely make again.

These were ok for us, not our favorite cookie.   My daughter thought they tasted like dark chocolate, which she doesn't care for.  My son that is a lover of all things chocolate only wanted to give this three stars!  I'm not sure if I will be making these again.

These are yummy.  They taste like chewy brownies.  I made them pretty small as they are very rich.  They did not make as many as the recipe said, so keep that in mind.

These are so delicious- like mini fudge brownies!  I stuck the dough in the freezer for 45 minutes and it was a breeze to work with.  These are very easy and I think they would look beautiful on a Christmas tray.

These turned out perfect! I followed the directions exactly, and had no trouble rolling out the dough, it wasn't sticky at all (it was in the fridge for 4 plus hours). Amazing recipe, these cookies will look great on the tray for Christmas!

To make them even better, if thats possible, I add about 2 teaspoons of instant coffee. This does NOT give them a coffee taste it intensifys the chocolatiness of these already fabulous cookies. You will not be disappointed either with the coffee addition or the original recipe so do make these!!!!

I'm not a chocolate fan but I heard nothing but "mmmm.. omg... sooo good.. mmmm.. omg.. sooo good" from my husband and kids.  I used half the recipe and it's made about 30 or so cookies.  I used parchment paper the first batch with no sticky issues and have the second batch with spray canola oil for the second batch *don't know the results yet*.  The best idea is the 45 min in the freezer, does make it much easier to handle.  I put the icing sugar in a ziploc bag; used a large soup spoon to dig it out of the bowl; then scraped it off the spoon with the sides of the bag.  NO MESS!  Once it is in the sugar it is much easier to handle and mold. FABULOUS recipe!  Baked on the second from the top shelf for the 10-12 minutes and it looks JUST like the photo! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR OUR NEW FAV COOKIE!

I thought this was a great recipe!  I agree about putting the dough in the freezer to make it easier to scoop.  I didn't have any powdered sugar so I rolled them in a few different things: coconut (which was delicious!!!), chopped pecans, and regular granular sugar.  The granular sugar still made the trademark crust, but wasn't quite as stark of a contrast to the cookie as powdered would have been.  Great!!

I'm very surprised so many people gave these cookies a good review, i found them too bitter though the texture was good. i would recommend using a 1/2 cup butter instead of the vegetable oil, 4 oz unsweetened chocolate (melted) in place of the cocoa, and decrease the baking powder to 1 teaspoon - these small changes make a WORLD of difference in these cookies.

I made the dough for these cookies and put in freezer for a couple weeks pulled out and made into balls rolled into powdered sugar then put on parchment paper and threw in oven.  Very easy and very yummy if you like chocolate:)!!

Would do more stars if I could!  HEAVEN in a bite size treat!  Only baked for 9 1/2 minutes and they were perfectly moist when they cooled. My son loved the visual texture of the cookie and could not stop himself from sneaking them every chance he got!  Thank you. Can't wait to see what the ladies think at church!  LOL!    Thanks again!

These were very yummy! I only left them in the fridge for about 2 1/2 hours and it was fine. I also baked on my STONEWARE and they did stick more than anything I have every baked on there, but, nothing serious and nothing ripped or broke. I did have to bake them about 2-3 minutes longer due to the stoneware too. LOVED THEM!

I would make these again with a few changes. I liked the flavor p[retty well, but I didn't like that these didn't spread out at all, I just prefer a larger, more spread out cookie. So, I would make a larger dough ball and maybe press it down or reduce the flour? I added a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips, which I liked, but I want to try milk chocolate instead, I think the semi-sweet was a smidge too bitter.  Also, I didn't need to put down parchment paper, these came up fairly well from a calphalon cookie sheet.

LOVED! these cookies. They got an "Oh, WOW" response. Although the dough was sticky i didn't have a problem working with it. I lined my baking sheet with aluminum foil and the came off nice and clean. My cooking time was longer, 15-20 minutes, but that may have been my oven. Also, dont be shy with the powdered sugar, coat them completely and you wont be sorry. Awesome cookies! These will be a part of my christmas gift baskets!!

My 3-year old granddaughter and I made these.  I substituted applesauce for the oil and Egg Beaters for the eggs.  The taste was delicious and the texture reminds me of a soft brownie which was great! The only disappointment was that we could not roll them into balls.  The dough was so sticky I had to drop the dough by teaspoons onto the cookie sheet.  I put the dough in the freezer as suggested by another reviewer but that didn't help.  They tasted good but certainly didn't have the presentation like the picture.

These cookies were soooo good! I made one minor change. Instead of oil, I used applesauce.  They turned out really pretty and tasty.  The dough is sticky even after refrigerating it.  My solution was to drop spoonfuls into the powdered sugar itself, coat the dough and then roll them.  I then coated the balls again with powdered sugar before placing them on the cookie sheet.  It's easier and faster this way.

Excellent recipe!  They turned out beautifully, just like the photo. I followed a reviewer's advice to freeze the dough, also to drop into sugar and then roll into balls. It was a little sticky, but not hard to work with and not time consuming. They turned out dense and tasting like a brownie, but not too moist or gooey as some reviewers mentioned. They were perfect and so easy that I'll definitely be making them over and over again.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Excellent! I used the suggestions and made some rolled in regular sugar with a hershey kiss mint truffle in the middle after cooking. VERY GOOD! Also made some the regular way and put chocolate chips in them. Excellent either way!

The recipe is great except for the amount of sugar. It came out too sweet. Next time I would reduce the sugar alot.

Very good, very chocolatey! The baking time was a bit off for me. After 12 minutes in the oven they were still raw in the middle, they needed an extra 5 minutes.

These are deadly. They're not TOO sweet, so eating three or four won't give you that sickly sweet stomach ache. They're extremely light and airy, so they don't fill you up. You can literally eat these all day. The dough is very sticky - I found that coating a spoon with the powdered sugar helped with scooping.

I've always loved the cake mix version, but being out of cake mix, I decided to try my hand at homemade. I halved the batch and used melted margarine instead of oil. Much better flavor than cake mix chocolate crinkles-more chocolatey, more tender texture. Unfortunately, they were also a little dryer ont he edges, even with the middle remaining rather gooey. That's probably my fault for subbing margarine. Overall, a good cookies that will remain a favorite, even when I'm out of cake mix.

Loved this recipe, though I didn't present them to friends as "cookies" but as "two-bite brownies" because the consistency suggested to me that's how they would be best received. If you put this in your mouth expecting a cookie taste you might be disappointed, but if you are expecting a fudge brownie you will die of joy.  A tip: I happened to have run out of powdered sugar, but I used an old housewives substitution of 1 cup regular sugar run in a blender with 1 tbsp cornstarch to make my own.  Another tip: I chilled the batter/dough overnight, instead of just four hours, before scooping it with a spoon into the powdered sugar. That way, it handled just fine.

Compared to other chocolate cookie recipes, these aren't as good.  Compared to brownies, (some people said these are like little brownies) these aren't as good.  The recipe isn't that bad, but in my opinion the time and ingredients could be put to much better use making either brownies or a different chocolate cookie recipe.  My husband and two-year old chocolate fanatic didn't even eat more than two of these; I liked them well enough to eat them, but . . .

These worked perfect.  I especially liked that I could use cocoa instead of baking squares.  Make sure to chill dough so they don't flatten out when baking.  Very easy.

This recipe is absolutely perfect. Easy, too. It yields deliciously moist and chocolaty cookies that are the perfect cross between a brownie and cookie. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used olive oil instead of plain veg oil. I got 40 cookies using a mini ice cream scoop. I chilled for 4.5hrs, and the dough was very easy to work with by then, though the ice cream scoop helped tremendously. Finally, definitely don't flatten the balls before putting them in the oven - they'll flatten on their own while baking. Thank you! A life-long keeper!!!!!

These taste like very good brownies. Very rich and satisfying, I baked them to give away to friends during valentines and I had some of them tell me they liked it. Personally though, I thought they were a little too sweet for my liking so if I were to bake for myself or for people who don't like overly sweet deserts I will reduce the sugar. The crinkled effect makes the cookie look really professional. I also found that the dough balls after being rolled in the confectioners sugar tends to absorb some of it so you don't want to flake away too much of the sugar or they wont appear properly white.

I'm obviously the minority here, but  I made these exactly like the recipe said, and the dough was looking great but when I put them in the oven they went completely flat and took about 20 minutes to bake. Haven't tried them yet but hopefully they will taste good enough to be worth all the hassle. Oh and I forgot to mention that I had smoke pouring out of my oven from using parchment paper...

These cookies ROCKED!!! Simple ingredients, fun to make... AWESOME TASTE.  No left overs here! For me, the hardest part of making these cookies is waiting for the dough to chill for 4 hours. :O) But they came out delicious. I'll be making these for years to come.  Thanks for this recipe!

LOVE THESE!!!!!  I'm pregnant and have been craving chocolate.  When I tried the dough I knew they were going to be great!  They are well worth the 4 hr wait in the fridge!

This recipe was great.  I did add a small bag of chocolate chips but only because I love chocolate.  I didn't use parchment paper just because I didn't have any.  I sprayed the cookie sheet with non-stick cooking spray and didn't have a problem.  I also sprayed my hands to roll the dough.  Thanks for sharing an excellent recipe!

Three little words work well with this cookie recipe and they would be O MY GOD !!!  Yes a litle messy but if you spray your hands with a little Pam while you are rolling the cookies clean up is a breeze.

These were so yummy!! I also put them in the freezer for about 45 mins to one hour instead of refridgerating them, they turned out perfect. Beautiful crinkles on top and everything, they are so moist and soft. A Christmas Classic!

I used Hershey's Special Dark cocoa powder in place of regular to ensure they would have that black coloring like the ones they have at the cafe. Definitely worked!

They were a bit more cake-like than I expected, but that's just personal preference. I'll definitely try this recipe again, next time making a few adjustments to yield a chewier cookie.

Yum! These are my personal favorite of all chocolate holiday cookies, and this recipe was just perfect. I used parchment paper so that the cookies don't burn on the bottom. They came out soft and the cocoa powder makes them chocolate-y without being too sweet. They taste great with or without nuts.

I used whole wheat flour, and I also couldn't wait 4 hours, I just had to try these cookies! I put them in the freezer for 20 minutes. Then I baked them for 8 minutes. They turned out so soft and chewy! Yummy!

Great recipe!  I have made these several times as they are one of my favorites.  They can get sticky in the process of making them, but if you spray a little oil on your hand, they won't stick while rolling them.  I love these cookies!

This recipe literally made my day!  

I was getting ready for a cookie swap and having a bad baking day.  The first cookie recipe I tried were terrible and didn't turn out.  I realized I had no confectioners sugar and we were having a blizzard-so I made some, then I burned my last 4 squares of baking chocolate in the microwave.  All I had was cocoa powder so I Googled "Chocolate Crinkles with cocoa powder" and the first hit was this recipe.  These came out FANTASTIC, moist & chewy!  I am not a big chocolate person normally and I couldn't keep away from these.  They are wonderful and really turned my day around.
THANK YOU SO MUCH!

These were just okay. I think they need a little more chocolate, maybe chopped or mini chips?? They are without a doubt, a labor of love to make because they are so sticky.

What a sticky mess...My kids (and I) were covered in chocolate by the end of it...BUT oh how it was worth it!!  These are the BEST cookies I've ever made.  I made half the batch after putting in freezer for 45 mins.  They still turned out great!  I made the rest the next day.  The dough was less sticky but still messy.  Will make this again and again!

Hmm, I changed my mind about these after the second day, while not liking them at first. It's like they got fudgier overnight. They're pretty good! My family couldn't get enough of them! All six dozen were eaten in a matter of three days. The outside is a sweet shell while the inside is quite moist and fudgy. I think these would make fantastic little Christmas gifts. I'll be baking these again!

I followed this recipe and made a li'l bit modification (used 1 3/4 cups sugar instead of 2). I also baked it at around 10 minutes only. I must say in terms of taste it is really gooey and fudgey. I have a concern though as it did not really look at brown and chocolatey as I would want. Would adding brown food color be ok for this or should I use a darker unsweetened cocoa? I used Hershey's unsweetened cocoa FYI.

I'd never thought I'd be posting a comment here but I could not resist.  This recipe turned out really well!!! It's really easy to make.  If you're not going to bake the whole mixture, you could store it in the fridge and bake it on another day. Every person who tasted it says, "Rach, it's so delicious."  It would definitely be one of my bestsellers in my cookie business.

Oooh, these are good.  I wondered if I was letting myself in for a lot of work with the refigeration for 4 hours (will try the freezer to save time next time) and the covering in icing sugar part, but it was worth it as these are really good.  I made them slightly bigger and ended up with about 40 - 45 cookies (hard to tell when husbands steal them while they are cooling) and there are almost none left since yesterday, although there is a trail of icing sugar! Thanks for a great recipe.

This is a tried and true recipe I've been using for quite a while.  To make rolling the balls easier, I just scoop up the right amount of dough and drop it in the powdered sugar, and after it's well coated, I roll it into a ball.

Gone shortly after baking was done. I also made another batch, this time adding 1 tsp mint extract in place of vanilla and they became Mint-Chocolate Crinkles, also a big hit!

First, it's definently a pretty cookie. I chilled the dough for a few hours to help with the rolling. It was still alittle sticky, but i coated my fingers with some confectioner's sugar. I agree with some of the other reviewers, this cookie is more brownie like than cookie, but it tasted pretty good.

Beautiful and elegant cookies.  I followed the recipe exactly - I let them sit in the frige overnight - because I just could not get to them.  They melt in your mouth!
2007 update:  I added andes peppermint chips to them, and they are out of this world.

I was a little worried about this at first.  The batter was very runny.  It was super thick and rolled into balls very easily after a couple hours in the frige.  These are great and we have made them three times in just a months time.  I put hersheys chocolate kisses in the middle of them as soon as I took them out of the oven.  I froze the kisses first to keep them from being too melty.  Yum-ee!!

This is an absolutely fabulous recipe.  I followed the advice of others and put the dough in the freezer for about an hour instead of waiting on the fridge.  Rolling the dough is a sticky job -- I washed my hands after about every half dozen, and that made rolling easier.  I also reused the same two pieces of parchment paper for the whole recipe, and that caused no problems.  

This one's going on my "favorites" list.

Wow - these were amazing and very easy to make.  They tasted like little brownies.  And it's a great recipe to make with kids.  I made them with my 3-year old.  I put the confectioner sugar in a big bowl and let him roll the cookies in the sugar.  Both of my boys couldn't get enough of them!

The Dough didn't come out right and I had to alter it. When I finally did get it to dough form it didn't taste worth any of the trouble I went through. Will NEVER make again!

Pretty good...Definitely tastes brownie"like". I was dissapointed with the overpowering taste of vanilla, however, hence my 4 star rating. Maybe this recipe could be better lessening the amount of vanilla it called for. They baked up very pretty though. Will try again! Thanx =)

My finicky husband swears these are just like the crinkles from his favorite bakery/sandwich shop!  Followed recipe, used high quality cocoa powder, and 1/2 the recipe to make about a dozen 2inch diameter cookies using a silpat cookie sheet liner.  Came out perfect - thank you!

These are not at all cookie like except the size. They taste just like brownies which I am not very fond of. My boyfriend did like them though. The key to getting them to crack is to first roll in gradulated sugar then the powdered sugar. They got better with age.

Very yummy!  I thought the dough was better than the actual cookies--it tasted like brownie batter!  I liked that it didn't include hardly any saturated or trans fats.  I used good quality unsweetened cocoa powder, which I think is necessary for an excellent cookie!

I couldn't find unsweetened cocoa at the supermarket (oh shock and disbelief), so I substituted Ghirardelli's sweetened chocolate/cocoa and cut the sugar in half. Like other reviewers, I thought the dough was way too runny...but the cookies turned out fine! They were a bit messy to scoop, admittedly. Next time I'll freeze them for a full hour instead of 45 minutes. In any case, I brought them to a play rehearsal and they were a hit. My older brother scarfed the rest. I'll have to make more later =)

I like buttery cookies and these tasted like they were made with, well, oil.  The flavor was flat and I would have given these three stars, but my husband says this is what they're supposed to taste like and he thought they were good, so four stars.  On the plus side, they're very pretty and easy to make (drop the dough from spoons directly into powdered sugar and roll from there.)  Will probably make these again, maybe subbing melted butter for the oil and adding some sort of spice to pick up the flavor.  If you want a pretty, tasty cookie, try the Meatball Cookies from this site.  They're awesome and easy too.

I liked this recipe for Chocolate Crinkles best due to the use of cocoa powder. It's much less of a hassle than melting chocolate squares. 

This is also a GREAT recipe to do with a child. The rolling the dough into a ball and then in the powdered sugar is irrestible fun.

A family favorite.  Be very aware of the time - your cookies can get dry if left in the oven too long.  Also, something I didn't quite understand from the directions...you roll a ball of dough around in the powdered sugar and simply place on the baking sheet.  DUH!  :P

i thought this recipe was great! i use butter instead of oil, add a few mini-ships for added texture and put them in the freezer for about an hour.  if you having trouble with them being too runny or sticky i think the butter would help because it solildifies better.  also if yours are too grainy try using a baker's sugar-it is more fine than standard sugar.  love them thank you ingrid!

These cookies were delicious.  I chilled the dough in the freezer for about 45 minutes and that was plenty of time.  The cookies are slightly crispy on the outside and the inside is the consistency of a perfect little fudge brownie. I'll definitely make these again.

I wasn't really impressed with these cookies, but my husband loved them.  The dough was very hard to work with and almost didn't seem hard enough to use.  But, I used spoons and scooped it into the sugar.  I would probably only make these again if hubby asked.  :)

We all loved this recipe.  It was so easy to whip up with my KitchenAid mixer and refrigerate.  My 3-1/2 year old daughter loved helping me roll the balls in powdered sugar.  We also rolled some in coconut and some ground almonds too!  VERY good. This cookie recipe will be a keeper around here.  In fact, I've got a double batch in the works now for my husbands' fishing trip tomorrow.  He LOVED them.

These are the best!  Really easy to make, although difficult to stir after a while!  I doubled the recipe so I had some for home and work, but I think I made the cookies too big.  I only ended up with 7 1/2 dozen!  I couldn't find a #50 scoop...oh well, these are the best!

Great recipe! Very fudgy-brownie like! Also, before I rolled them into powdered sugar I first rolled them into regular white sugar in order for the powdered sugar to stick when I baked them! Delicious recipe!

I actually made these vegan for my roommates (as they are vegans) and had to make a few adjustments. (I used 1tbls of white vinegar and 1tsp of baking soda for each egg) and had to add a little extra oil to get it to stick. the batter was never quite as thin as in the video but you can't even taste that these were vegan. I brought them later to my friends house for a dinner party and everyone asked for th recipe not even realizing that I made them with vegan substitutions. 10/10 will make again both vegan and non vegan ways

It turned out to be great! I made it as christmas gifts for friends and they all loved it. Added Baileys Irish Cream, vanilla extract and almond flour for rich flavor. The quantity of flour should be increased or dough will go too sticky.

So delicious!  Tender-crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside.  They're like brownie bites--without the nuts--and everyone gets a corner piece.

These are delicious! The only thing I changed is I added some peanut butter and chocolate chips, for fun. I chilled for about five hours and then baked a dozen. YUM!! I'm baking the rest tomorrow after school and I can't wait to bring them to work!!! Holy cow!

Would definitely make again. Despite the amount of sugar, it wasn’t too sweet because of the unsweetened cocoa. Good balance of flavors. Rich brownie taste but in cookie form

My son and I made these for Santa - three batches, one from recipe and one for each of our tastes.  They are great 'as is' a tasty brownie cookie.  Like others have commented, use plenty of powdered sugar to get the magnificent crackled look.  For his, we added a tsp of peppermint to make mint chocolate brownies.  For mine, we added a tsp of cayenne pepper and a tsp of Mexican vanilla to make 'hot chocolate' brownies.  We added green and red sprinkles to the powdered sugar so we could tell the three versions apart.

Very good recipe! I refrigerated for about  5 hours and maybe would use parchment paper as powdered sugar spilled on cookie sheet and was a bit messy.  ( I usually do croissant rolls and cookies on my air baked cookie sheets) .  I also did not use a scoop I just used a spoon and rolled into balls for uniformity.

believe it or not, I had never heard of this cookie until this year when my daughter's roommate mentioned them. I will now be putting this cookie on all future plates!  Christmas plates, that is...  not the easiest one to make, and SO messy!!  can't say I will be making them with my grandchildren for a few years,  lol  (I found that a light spray on my hands with oil made it  a bit easier to roll them)

Wow--were these ever good. I followed one reviewer's suggestion about baking one sheet of cookies at a time to maximize "crinkling," and it worked very well. I also chose to chill the dough for about 45 minutes in the freezer. These were rich and chocolately, but did not  have the same texture as a brownie.

These are some of the best chocolate cookies I've ever had! Really rich and moist, not too sweet; beautiful crinkle top. I loved them and made 3 batches this winter. Brought them to a cookie and exchange and they were a big hit.  A perfect Christmas cookie gift!

I made this recipe, adapted with gluten-free (gf) flour.  I used the King Arthur "measure for measure gf flour.  I also followed a suggestion in the comments and added 2 tsp of mint extract (in addition to the vanilla).  We used a cookie scoop and made 68 cookies.  Cooked the full 12 minutes.  They both looked and tasted delicious.

This was basically brownie batter  baked as a cookie. They tasted just like brownies. They were very messy to roll into balls for the cookies , personally I would rather just make brownies.

I made these a few years ago as written,  subbing GF flour and they were good. The second time I made these I subbed for GF flour and changed the vegetable oil to coconut oil and they were out of this world! The coconut oil was such a wonderful combination with the chocolate flavour!

Oh myyyy.  These are dangerously good.  I don't want to share them with anyone!  They're similar to brownies, with a pretty coating of powdered sugar on top.  Next time I'm going to take these up a notch by adding a little peppermint oil.

Followed the recipe except for measuring out the dough for the cookies. I just eye-balled it. Mine were a little thicker and rounder than pictured but were absolutely delish! In my electric oven, cooking for 11 minutes was perfect.

Rather than "rolling" the balls in confectioners sugar, I put some confectioners sugar in bowl, dropped the dough balls in, shook them around and dropped them on the cookie sheet.

These will be a holiday staple!

These cookies are excellent when using black cocoa or Dutch processed cocoa. I believe this is what Moonnoodle is referring to in her review about the color. However, I have made these using regular cocoa and people love them! It’s a must every Christmas.

Ok. I used the semi sweet dark chocolate powder instead of just chocolate powder *this reallllly is the stickiest dough to even mix,  HOLY COWS!! 

Cover. Put in the fridge for a good hour. (I did it over night and working with the dough was easy). 

These cookies are both pretty and delicious! Thanks for the recipe! I now have black and white cookies!!

These cookies are SO good! I make them every year for Christmas and they're always a hit. I typically make them as-is and throw some chocolate chips in the dough at the end for an extra punch of chocolate, but this year I used dark cocoa powder in place of the regular powder (it's what I had on hand) and it was absolutely delicious. 

Be sure to thoroughly chill the dough or they'll spread a bit. I always pop the bowl of dough into the freezer for a while.

This recipe was perfect except for the part about it making 6 dozen. Maybe my cookies were slightly bigger but I was able to make 4 dozen. They are so pretty. Add the peppermint extract for holiday cookies and always use parchment or a Silpat on your cookie sheets. Also think about the powdered sugar like flour when you are making cut outs. Pat some on your hands for rolling the balls so it's not so sticky.

These cookies were perfect. I followed the recipe exactly and gave them out as gifts. The video says it make 6 dozen cookies, but it only makes 3 dozen. We will be making more again soon. My 6 year old son said, "they are the best cookies ever."

Good cookie,  pretty but challenging to work with. 
Used butter rather than oil,  still sticky after 24 hours in refrigerator.  In freezer now for next batch. 
Chocolaty,  but not as strong as i anticipated they would be.

Very good chewy cookie. I was skeptical at first because the dough was SO gooeey. But I put it in the fridge overnight (2-3 hours should be good though) or as some reviewers suggested in the freezer until it firms up just a bit. I used a melon scooper to scoop them out, I like smaller cookies. Baked for about 9-10 minutes but ovens vary so start with the lower time and check on them every minute or so. Delicious!!

This was great! So easy and very tasty. I substituted with 1 teaspoon peppermint extract since I was making it for a holiday cookie exchange party. I thought it was a little too much peppermint but my sister and nephews loved it. So if you want a hint of peppermint use less but if you want a good peppermint flavor 1 teaspoon is perfect. I made three different cookies and these were the best. To get the crinkle make sure you fully coat with powdered sugar and move the rack to the upper part of the oven ( I used the second slot in mine). Also, don’t dip them in powder then put on the tray that is sitting on top of the hot oven, the powder will start to melt into the cookie and you lose the effect. I will definitely make these again.

This is the recipe I’ve been looking for!  I made these cookies years ago - my favorites! - but somehow lost the recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly, except my oven runs a little hot so I baked them 9 mins.  Perfect, and so yummy that my family is mad that I’m taking half to a cookie exchange party.

Every year my family gathers to fellowship and bake Christmas goodies.  I decided to add this recipe to our list, just to try it. out  WOW!  We are so HAPPY with the addition.  The only thing wrong is you need to double or triple the recipe.  We will be making these again.  Followed the recipe as stated - the cookies are perfect!!
Thank you for  sharing.

My workmates and I loved them! I only baked them for about 10mins so it would still be moist and soft in the middle. Planning to add 1/2 melted chocolate chips in the mix next time to intensify the chocolate flavour.

Made this recipe exactly as is.  Very nice cookie.  Good chocolate flavor, soft in the middle (not chewy)  and a little firm around the edges.  Not too sweet.

Delicious as instructed. Used a medium cookie scoop which yielded about 40 cookies. However, I am trying to mail these out today and didn’t have four hours to refrigerate. I stuck the bowl in the freezer for 45 minutes then scooped. I then re-froze my scoops of dough for 7 minutes or so before rolling and dipping in powdered sugar. Turned out beautifully!

I had an OLD recipe for these cookies that just didn't seem to work anymore.  I tried this one and the cookies turned out GREAT.  Soft and chewy - and delicious.
This one is a keeper!

Crunchy on the outside and chewy in the inside. Loved this! Be sure to roll in white sugar before you roll them in the powdered sugar. That helps the shape a lot.

My favorite cookie brownies. They look amazing. The 4 hour+ cooling is totally worth the wait. Rollin White sugar for a different cookie look, and pop a Hershey kiss on top too- same batter, 4 different looking kinds of cookies. Make them. Make them now. You’ll be glad you did.

This is my first review but definitely not my first rodeo on Allrecipes. These cookies were *amazing!* To the reviewer who mentioned she put peppermint extract in place of vanilla, you have no idea how happy you made my family! I used one tsp vanilla and half a tsp peppermint (no other changes!), let my dough chill for the recommended 4 hours, and had the most fun rolling them through the powdered sugar. My cookies crinkled, looking just like the pictures, and my family and coworkers *raved* about these. Thank you for the great recipe!!

Delicious, soft cookies. They tasted very much like small, individual, dense brownies. If you love chocolate, these are an excellent choice. All of my kiddos and their peers LOVED them

These delicious cookies were moist, fudgy, and tasted almost just like a brownie! I was in a hurry, so I did as some other reviewers suggested and froze the dough for 45 minutes instead of chilling for four hours, and they turned out great. They have the appearance of being dusted with snow and would be a great addition to anyone's holiday cookie tray!

I made these for a bake sale and they turned out beautifully. It is really a lovely cookie, very tasty and kid-friendly. I followed the recipe exactly. It is very simple and easy to make. The batter initially is like a thick brownie batter, but thickens to more of a cookie dough consistency after being chilled. The taste and texture of the baked cookie is similar to a brownie.

This is my second time.  They come out perfect.  However I learned a lesson by weakening and wetting my hand a little on the last tray, cause the dough really sticks to your hands even after refrigeration.  What happened was this last dozen had more brown crackle than white cause the extra moisture dissolved the confectioners sugar during baking, even though they went in looking like my other two trays.?? Just bear with the sticky ness.   So

I have made this for the first time and they came out really good. By I made some adjustments on the recipe. The additional adjustments I made are: I added 1/4 teaspoon for baking soda. And thanks to the “5 Tricks You Need to Know to Make Perfect Chocolate Crinkle Cookies” this 5 tricks did help the make the crinkles perfectly. Just google the 5 tricks you need to know to make perfect chocolate crinkle cookie online and you’ll find out the steps by steps. And also I preheated my oven for 325 and bake my crinkles for 16 minutes and they were delicious, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside I will surely make this again.

They looked absolutely perfect, and the batter tasted great, but they unfortunately got packed up before I could try them. With how gorgeous they are, they are definitely gonna be in the Holiday Cookies mix.

I really liked this recipe.  The dough was easy to make, and the taste of the cookies was amazing!  However, there were some problems with the dough.  It was not firm enough, even after a full 24 hours of chilling.  It made a sticky mess of the kitchen.  But the finished product looked perfect and tasted the absolute best!  The mess was worth it!  I will definitely be making these again!

Love this cookie! Delicious, easy to make and looks fancy :) They do get messy when rolling them out (read some tips I haven't tried yet) but well worth it. I've made them many times and have added mint extract for extra yumminess. Give 'em a try!

They're sticky and doughy, they don't roll up like the recipe calls for. I even added extra flour to try and roll them.

I'll stick to a box mix.

I didn't have any vanilla extract so I used raspberry instead.  Hubby said the cookies taste just like some of the candies we buy at our favorite chocolate shop.  He said don't lose that recipe  :)

I only used 1 1/2 cups of white sugar and added 1/2 cup of melted bittersweet chocolate before adding the eggs. These are heavenly.

Great chewy cookie. Super right out of the oven! Sometimes I substitute brown sugar for half the sugar in the recipe for extra richness and chewiness.

I was super excited to make these. 
I substituted the oil for homemade pot butter and they turned out fabulous! 
I was skeptical at first with the consistency of the batter but once set in the fridge for the recommended 4 hours they were awesome. I left the batter in the fridge for 2 days and the last 2 batches were the best!

The dough is very sticky, so you do need to put it in the fridge to handle it.  I even put in the freezer between batches.  They turned out really good like brownie bites and they look very impressive.  I added some chocolate chips I had in the pantry (maybe a cup or so), and it really enhanced the chocolate flavor.  I would add the chips again next time I make them.  A really good cookie that everyone seemed to enjoy.

These cookies turned out fabulous! So pretty and so tasty! I’m here to tell you though, that the dough DOES NOT NEED TO CHILL FOR FOUR HOURS. I didn’t have any time for chilling, but I tried them anyway. I stuck the dough in the freezer for 15 minutes because that’s all the time I had, and they baked perfectly. I also rolled them in granulated sugar simply because I was out of powdered sugar, and they tasted and looked divine. Everyone raved about them. I will try them in powdered sugar next time. These will be one of my go-to cookies from now on!

Amazing! Followed the directions and they turned out perfect! They ended up more like a brownie than a cookie, which we preferred!  Only change I made was to add 2 tsps of espresso powder.

The easiest and yummiest recipe!  I've shared it with many friends! 
The best advance from another baker was to cut dough in half (one half at a time is more than enough) and freeze for 45 minutes instead of refrigerating for hours. Then you always have a spare batch ready for company in the freezer, all you have to do is roll, dunk in powdered sugar and bake!

Perfect little fudgey cookies!.
I refrigerated over night & started making the cookies right out of the fridge, this made it easy to roll into walnut size balls....not messy!! 
Baked 9 min. on parchment. 
*Keeping matter cold before using is the trick!

You have to make sure you stir in the flour and other dry ingredients or else you will get an airy cookie that is taller instead of wider. But other than that it’s amazing.

Delicious, fudge-y cookies! I love how they taste exactly like a brownie. These are my new favorite cookie. I used coconut oil as my oil, and they didn’t taste coconut-y at all. The saturated fat in coconut oil makes it a better option than vegetable oil. Also, I halved the recipe, but kept the vanilla extract the same measure. At 3 hours the dough was hard, so I had to let it sit out for a half hour. This is the best cookie.

Although I followed the ingredient list, I only wanted to make 1/4 the recipe knowing I'd eat them all at once. I also had guests so with limited time, I put the batter in the freezer for 25 minutes and that was enough to roll into powdered sugar. The cookies were done at 13 minutes perfectly. They're very much a brownie flavor cookie, nice & moist. I'll make them again for sure!

These were so easy and result in a beautiful, delicious cookie! After reading other reviews, instead of putting the dough in the fridge, I put the dough in the freezer for 45 minutes, then scooped them directly into the powdered sugar. Great recipe!

I made these cookies the other night and let me say they were absolutely AMAZING!!! I was a little to eager to wait 4 hours for the dough to chill in the fridge so I covered it and put it in the freezer for 1 hour. It worked out perfectly. As for rolling the dough, it's very sticky so I used a pair of disposable gloves and it made thing super easy. I totally recommend this recipe to anyone trying to get their chocolate fix!!!

Very rich, yummy, chocolatey cookies! They aren't difficult to make, but the dough can get sticky and messy if it gets warm and is handled too much. I chill mine before using as directed, but putting it in the freezer as some have suggested may be a good idea.

Very good recipe!  I’ve tried others that came out super crispy which I didn’t like.  This recipe came out with a chewy center and a nice slightly crisp exterior.  If your not a fan of heavy confectioner sugar (can be cloyingly sweet) you may want to be super light handed on rolling the balls in the sugar or only dip the top half before placing them on the sheet.

These are amazing. Like a brownie in a cookie. I made them as   a Christmas cookie and had to make them again before Christmas. Definitely a keeper.

The cookies taste like moist brownies.  My family loved them.  I read the other reviews and used a lot of powdered sugar so they are a bit messy.  They are worth it!

If you are looking for black-dark cookies, then use "black cocoa."  This used to be a professional ingredient, but now is readily available online.  Otherwise, these are a solid rendition of a holiday classic.

I used dark cocoa, it was good but not as sweet as I would have liked it.  Great, easy recipe that can be made with lots of variations such as almond extract. I’m going to try this next with expresso.  A keeper for sure!

These were wonderful. We used them for Santa cookies. I had made 2 other batches of other cookies, but they did not turn out well. I will be making these frequently! They didn't last long.

I found these cookies to be very bland and lacking the chocolate crinkle cookie flavor. They also tasted under-baked and I could taste the raw dough after having them in the oven for the full 12 minutes. I had to leave them in for 16 instead. I wouldn’t make these using this recipe again.

I made these for Christmas with several other cookies and everyone agreed, these were one of the favorites.  They’re rich, chewy, chocolaty and delicious.  I wouldn’t change anything in this recipe.  They came together quickly, no exotic ingredients or directions.  They are impressive and easy to make.  I’ll be making these many, many more times.

my kids absolute fav cookie. easy to make (little messy when rolling). One of my co-workers said it tasted like soft pillowy clouds. update-I added some walnuts to the last batch going in the oven...soooo good, loved it, but that kid of mine refused to even try it with walnuts. whatever, more for me.

It was very yummy!! I halved the recipie and used a little less cloves than suggested, as well as following another users suggestion to add melted chocolate to the batter. I used 1/4 cup of it for 1/2 a batch. Soooo good. I left them in the fridge overnight and baked them the next day, they tasted great but needed to be in the oven closer to 14 minutes than to 10, but that may be because I made balls that fit in a round tablespoon for measurement. Overall though, they were delicious.

The BEST chocolate crinkle ever! It was perfect as the sweetness was just right and iit's chewy that everyone in my family loves it, even the ones that are not fan of eating chocolates, they said they like it! I did 2 sets, i ended up having 100 pcs. I tried to wet my hands to make it round as what the other user says in the reviews but i ended up contributing or adding water to the crinkle itself and when it came out it was burnt easily. So Based on my experience, it would be easier to make it into a ball size using one tablespoon measurement that has a rounded bottom. I used teaspoons to make the edges round, transferring, alternating in between teaspoons. Also do take note that you can make it even more rounder when you're coating it with the icing sugar. I did 9 minutes on a 176C temperature. Thank you for this recipe.

HUUUUGE HIT!!! I made these for work and got nothing but complements from them! I did alter the recipe just a bit. I like dark chocolate, so I substituted half of the regular unsweetened cocoa with Hershey's Special Dark unsweetened cocoa. I  also added about 3/4 cup of mini semisweet chocolate chips.  Definitely a new favorite cookie!

Tastes just like a brownie bite.  A little crispy, like a cookie, on the outside and chewy like a brownie, on the inside.  Made them to gift and everyone liked them.  This is a VERY easy recipe! I am going to try variations including: chocolate ginger and chocolate spice with dried fruits and nuts.

I used Ghiradelli cocoa and I also added 1/4 tsp Hershey’s special dark cocoa. I chilled the dough for 24 hours and had no issues with rolling them- I made a ball shape and then dipped in powdered sugar before rolling a bit more and then dipping again. I used parchment paper and baking spray- no issues with sticking and I transferred them to a rack 5 minutes after taking them out. They turned out wonderful! Fudgy and delicious!

I used dark chocolate cocoa. Learned I could re-use the same piece of sprayed parchment paper at least 3 times. A lot of work for a cookie that tasted just like a brownie. Next time I'll add peppermint as others suggested. They do look cute!

These came out perfectly! I made the recipe exactly as written, and it worked great. They are soft, fudgy, and got the crackled top perfectly. I had no issues with the dough being too sticky either. I would like to try these with butter in place of oil in the future, just for a bit more flavor. Thanks for the recipe!

This is my favorite Christmas cookie, and one we make every year! We almost always add about a cup of mini chocolate chips, although we change up the flavors. We've done all semisweet, a mix of semisweet and dark, and (my personal favorite) mint chocolate! 

One thing we've done in the past when traveling is make the dough ahead of time, then refrigerate in plastic-wrapped logs. (I imagine they would freeze just fine too.) Then we just roll em out, dip, bake, and voila! Fresh, homemade cookies! 

I saw another review that recommended adding a bit of cinnamon and dipping them in a mix of cinnamon and powdered sugar, which I will definitely be trying this year as I bet it's delicious.

I used a #40 scoop because I didn't have a #50 so I got just over 3 dozen cookies from this recipe. The dough was very sticky and somewhat difficult to scoop, but the effort was worthwhile. The result was a cookie that has a crisp outside and a chewy inside and a flavor reminiscent of a brownie. The chocolate flavor is assertive but not cloying and I think the sweetness is just right. I might add some espresso powder to the next batch for a little bump in flavor. I'm definitely adding this recipe to my holiday cookie collection.

Sweet Chocolate Pillows of goodness!  These are wonderful.  I did not use the parchment - but just a light spray of cooking spray.  I baked them for 15 minutes    These will be on the Christmas cookie list for many years to come.

Just made these cookies last night. Followed directions with all listed ingredients. I took another reviewers advice to let it chill in the freezer rather than 4 hours in the refrigerator. I kept it in the freezer for about 1 1/2 hours. The dough was perfect to work with. Cookies are so rich and chocolatey. Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

I didn't like this cookie, it's more like a cake.  Although I brought them into work and everyone said they loved them because of the cake consistancy.  I should add that I don't like choc cake so that could be the reason I didn't like these.

I will be making more TOMORROW!!!!
I think I've eaten about 7 of these today (sorry not sorry)
This recipe is so delicious. 
Make sure you take them out of the oven when they still look a ~little~ gooey on top In the center. 
There is a very fine line between PERFECT chocolate crinkle cookies and BURNT chocolate crinkle cookies.
 also, letting them cook for a few minutes on the cookie sheet fresh out of the oven is V important.
BRB going to grab my eighth cookie!!!
(they taste just like brownie bites!!!!!!!!)

The only change I made was to grease the cookie sheet instead of using parchment. I did follow a recommendation from another review and used the 2nd from the top rack placement and only baked one sheet at a time..I think they look great and they're delicious. A festive, easy cookie!

Followed the directions exactly and they came out perfect and delicious! I did take the advice of others on here and made sure they were coated generously with the powdered sugar and put them on the second rack down and for 10 minutes. Very easy to make!

Super yummy and very easy recipe. I made sure to really coat the cookie balls in powdered sugar before baking, and it did not disappoint! They turned out beautifully and they were a nice, chocolate addition to my Christmas cookie exchange.

1st time to make it for a charity event sale and it's already perfect!  The remaining pieces, we ate in a few days (with self control), but we could have easily eat it in just a day because it's so yummy! Looks great and so appetizing too! My husband and daughter liked it a lot. The only reason I won't be making it is to not ruin my diet. Because it's really hard to resist it when it's sitting on the kitchen counter.

By the way, it's perfect when dipping with coffee or milk! 

I reduced the sugar by 1/4 and the sweetness is just perfect. I suggest to put some powdered sugar on the plate after you rolled them (I rolled few balls first before putting in the powdered sugar bowl) since I noticed that they are sticking on the plate. I just put it in the fridge overnight. The dough melts a bit in my hand when I'm on the 5th ball and it became too sticky. So next time, I'll try to put in the freezer for 1 hour so it's cooler. 

Using parchment or baking paper is amazing on this cookie. I read someone said that parchment paper is too valuable in the kitchen. You don't need a lot of parchment paper because you can just use just one for all 3 or more batches in the oven. And you only need to bake one at a time since this should be in 2nd from the highest rack in the oven. 

Too glad I've found this recipe. Can't wait to make more!

I didn't use parchment paper, but instead a lightly greased pan. I also took the suggestion of wetting my hand before forming the balls. I baked them for 7 minutes and they were perfect.

When I made these they did not flatten.  I rolled the them into balls and when they came out of the oven after 10 min they were still balls.  They crinkled but did not flatten out like a cookie.  Does anyone know why that would happen?  They still tasted great but was wondering why they did not flatten?

Made exactly as recipe prescribed, except didn't have quite a full cup of Cocoa.  Made no difference.  They were delicious. Definitely helpful to chill the dough overnight, and begin coating with the powdered sugar as you are rolling in to balls - keeps the stickiness to a minimum.

They stay soft and chewy. It's like a brownie cookie. So good. An insane amount of sugar though (but hey, it's not supposed to be healthy right?)

I have made these for 40 years. They are everybody's favorite. I fridge dough overnight. I roll the balls. My husband rolls balls in powered sugar. I use parchment. I tap the baked cookie to test for doneness...soft but outer coat is firm. They pack well for gifting. Never had a failed batch. I use a kit henaid mixer to mix every I gredient.

Oh my goodness these are AMAZING. I added a little extra spice with 1/2 tsp ground cloves and 1/4 tsp nutmeg and they ended up so great. This recipe is definitely going in the books.

It's soft and chewy and very sweet. I reduced the sugar to half and might tweak the recipe a little bit more to my preference next time. I read and followed the comments and other member's suggestions. I placed it in in the freezer for 45mins to 1 hour, then scooped it directly to the confectioner's sugar and rolled it to medium sized balls (about an inch and a half thick) then baked it. Overall, this is a really good and easy recipe.

These are so easy to throw together.  They taste fantastic.
The chocolate lovers in the family wait on them to cool off and eat after baking.  I always double the recipe and make for Christmas. This is a keeper.

Won't make this recipe again. There is another one out there that uses a box of cake mix, 1 egg and a container of cool whip. Roll into balls, bake, then roll in confectioner's sugar. Now THAT's a moist and easy cookie!

These are tasty, and look nice too. The only bad thing, towards the end of rolling them into balls the dough became soft and sticky. This made it messy and hard to form into a uniform  shape. I'm sure rechilling it would have solved my issue though.

Loved this recipe subsituted 1/2 cup coconut oil instead of 1/2 cup vegetable oil as well as adding 2tsp of cinnamon to help bring out the chocolate flavour even more. Dough was wet so I added 1 cup extra of all purpose flour.

I followed the recipe exactly. The dough was tough to work with. You kind of just have to scoop the cookie dough right into the powdered sugar to start to roll them into balls. I sprayed my cookie sheets with Pam & they did not stick at all. These are soft & very rich cookies. They taste just like brownies.  They're very good!

Made these with my son and they turned out great! We followed the recipe exactly except we added 1/2 c chocolate chips. Followed another reader's recommendation of dropping tablespoons of dough into the confectioner's sugar before rolling them into a ball.

I have been making crinkle cookies for 40+ years, using the same recipe for all those years. So I thought I’m going to switch this up just a little. I used a recipe that called for cocoa in it instead of baking chocolate. Will not do it with cocoa ever again, the cookie dough was horrid to mix, way too stiff. I have nerve damage in my hands from having chemo this summer, well needless to say I had one heck of a time with it. ??

Can’t  imagine how sweet these would be with the full amount of sugar indicated in recipe. I made this recipe with 1.5 cups of white sugar instead of 2.  They were still way too sweet. The chololate flavor is very pronounced which is great, but next time i will try using only  1.25 cups.
Update: they were not too sweet the day after. Will stick to 1.5 cups of sugar. My guests praised them.

I personally loved it! Followed the recipe exactly as stated. Fudgy in the middle and light and chewy on the outside. My only complaint would be that after reading all the reviews I did use quite a bit of powdered sugar and it was somewhat overwhelming (just not a big fan of it). Other than that they turned out really cute!

I cut the recipe in half because I thought that was entirely to many cookies. it made 20 cookies. I wish I would have made the entire recipe now. I only at two they were extremely delicious however those coupled with a glass of milk gave me an upset stomach. I think I just limit myself to one from now on. they are very rich. Also I did find the batter hard to manage after rolling about 4 cookies it became very sticky. messy but worth it. #chocoholic

These cookies are amazing!  Didn't change a thing but added a 10 oz. bag of dark chocolate/mint chips.  These chips are only available seasonally around here so I always stock up for the holidays.  I love to bake and these cookies are frequently requested.

I made the recipe exactly as written, and these cookies are delicious!  I took one commenters advice and used the center rack of the oven and baked only one cookie sheet at a time.  Ten minutes baking time is perfect.
Very pretty, and they taste like brownies.  Easy to make as well.

These are the most moist and flavorful cookies I've made in my whole life! There is no cookie better than this one.
I saw that a lot of the reviews say it wont flatten. If you just look at the picture you can see that these are rounded cookies!!! I've made them many times and will make them many more.

I originally made this from the Betty Crocker cookie book when I was about 12. This was my first successful cookie I ever made. This recipe is very similar except that I use Olive Oil instead of vegetable. The only reason was that I didn't have the latter on hand when I first made these. I find that they are more fluffier and brownie like with olive oil than with vegetable. If you use olive oil, not that it just smells weird when in batter form.

These are the best Chocolate Crinkles! When I make them as directed (including using the parchment paper) they always turn out perfectly, and deliciously! I make this recipe quite often. Sometimes, I use egg substitute and have always had good results, but this time, I probably used a bit too much egg substitute and they weren't as good (too cake like). They are soft in the middle and last for days. Everytime I make these, I am asked for the recipe. DELICIOUS!

I saved this recipe awhile ago and just got around to making them today. After having a cookie similar last weekend in Door County, Wisconsin, I made a few changes. I added a bag of dried cherries and used one teaspoon of almond extract and one vanilla. They turned out very soft and flavorful. The recipe is a great starting point. The next time I’m going to add walnuts along with the cherries. During the holidays I may use peppermint extract or even candy canes. But the best thing about this recipe is they are dairy free! Having two kids who have a dairy intolerance, finding recipes that don’t use dairy makes this momma very happy.

Outstanding! These cookies have a very thick dough that is almost brownie-like in texture. I decided to refrigerate the dough overnight in order to make sure that it was thoroughly chilled. Made true to the original recipe. These are a holiday staple in our house.

I think these are really good, definitely a 'brownie bite'.  I made with vanilla extract but , as other reviewers noted, it would be fantastic for the holidays with part peppermint extract!  To get  medium size cookies, I lightly flattened the dough balls with a glass dredged in powdered sugar. For me, the recipe made just shy of 4 dozen.

This is my go-to cookie recipe! I absolutely recommend adding up to 3 tbsp of espresso/instant coffee powder to make it even more bittersweet. Foolproof and delicious, very moist and fudgy.

Family love it! I just add some hot water to make it soft and use just 3/4 cup of sugar instead of 1 cup so it won’t be to much sweet.. (side note I just use the half of the ingredients for my first try)

These cookies are perfect. I make the dough in the morning and refrigerate it until afternoon. I use a cookie scoop, plop it in a bowl of confectionary sugar, roll it around and then cook for 10 minutes. You absolutely do not need to grease the parchment paper. The cookies slide right off. I pull them at exactly 10 minutes and then leave them on the cookie sheet while I get the next bunch ready to go in the oven. (So between 3 & 5 minutes depending on how many times I get interrupted lol) In between sheets of cookies I throw the dough in the freezer to keep it cold and workable.  Adding some peanut butter chips to the dough is also fantastic. Oh, and the tops of the cookies are suppose to "crack"....that's what makes them look so cool!

Literally so freaking GOOD.  Ok so here's the deal- I slightly up the cocoa to make them more chocolatey....and immediately put the batter in the FREEZER...let it sit 20 mins....and mold into balls and dunk into powder sugar, then flatten.  If they don't mold into balls, put the batter back into the freezer for another 10 minutes.  Seriously these are amazing.

I was really disappointed by these cookies. They are essentially brownies, I was expecting cookies, I already have a go-to brownie recipe for when I want brownies and this is not it. The one thing I did like about them was they looked quite nice, just wasn't what I was looking for cookie-wise.

I followed the process exactly as it mentions with the chilling the dough for 4+ hours, and these came out great. It's essentially a mini brownie. The family loved them and they are fun to make together!

Amazing cookies - and can easily be made vegan by substituting flax egg (1 tbsp ground flax and 2.5 tbsp water for each egg)!! I've made these multiple times (vegan and not) and have added melted chocolate, chocolate chips, or cinnamon on occasion. I always pop the batter in the freezer for about half an hour before scooping, which works perfectly.

I made these exactly as directed.   These cookies were so pretty and the chocolate lovers in my family (and friends) loved them.  they were fudge like, constant with a brownie .  I did make them a bit larger than the recipe called for so the bake time was about 14 mins.  will make them again :)  (I did use special dark coco powder)

Delicious! Light tasting and definitely hit the spot for when I have a chocolate craving. Subbed the eggs for egg whites and used olive oil in place of vegetable oil, turned out just fine! Would definitely make again.

I received race reviews on this cookie.  It is a bit too much chocolate for my palate but my wife and friends loved it.  It is easy to mix everything together, but once our of the refrigerator it was a mess until I found the way to make the balls in a better way.  The appearance is sensational and a great cookie for chocolate-lovers.

This cookie is basically a brownie rolled in powdered sugar.  They are definitely beautiful to look at! My family loves them, but I’m struggling with knowing they contain vegetable oil instead of butter. I clearly have a hang-up in this regard. If you are emotionally stable and don’t trip on tiny little details that truly don’t matter, I suggest you give them a try ;)

I made two batches on the same day, each time following the recipe exactly!  I also used the trick of raising the oven rack  to the second notch.  The first batch was made using dutched process cocoa.  They were soft inside and  puffy and... very crackled.  FABULOUS!  Just like mom used to make.  Plenty of great chocolate flavor.   The  only difference in the second batch was using regular cocoa (much cheaper)which made two differences in the outcome.  The cookies were not as puffy and the chocolate was not nearly as  rich.  I'll make these over and over but only using the dutch cocoa!! And, by the way...LOTS of powdered sugar!

One of my favorite cookie recipes, these are no fail! I’ve made them a couple of times before and they always turn out decadent! Like other reviewers suggested, before you shape the dough, throw the dough into a freezer or refrigerator to harden up. I also make sure to add a cup of chocolate chips or hand-chopped chocolate chunks, once baked, the chocolate turns gooey and gives the cookie a brownie-lava cake like texture. I’ve found that baking them for only ten minutes is perfect and letting them cool is key. If I go over that time, they’ll be as hard as rocks.  If you’re looking for a Christmas cookie recipe, these are perfect! Around the holidays, I add a teaspoon or two of peppermint extract and it tastes just like a York peppermint patty!

These were a HUGE hit with my family and friends at Christmas. 
This is a sticky dough so I found it much easier to plop the spoon or scoopful of dough in the powdered sugar and then form into balls while rolling around in the sugar. Also, I kept the dough chilled in between baking batches to help cut down on the stickiness while handling.

I refrigerated dough for about 2 hrs. Then I  rolled the balls and put pan in refrigerator while I rolled 2nd pan. Then rolled all in powdered sugar. Cookies stayed thick. PS: This is a thick batter used bowl mixer with the dough hook.  I watched video after I made them. Rolling one inch balls does not yield 6 doz cookies but a fair amount . They are not overly sweet but very chocolatey. This is a keeper.. Thank you

Followed the recipe and these cookies came out perfect. Used a 1/2 tbsp. for the cookie scoop and rolled them thickly in icing sugar. I found baking them on a higher oven rack helped them crack more effectively and also I ended up with about 84 cookies rather than 70 so me and every in-law we have were very happy with these tasty chewy brownie-like cookie.

I made these just as the direction said. The batter came out sticky and gooey like cake batter. No way could you roll it into balls. Instead I just spooned drops onto the cookie sheet and sprinkled with powdered sugar. They tasted good, almost like a brownie. But they look nothing remotely like the picture.

It is wonderful to find an already dairy free recipe that I didn't have to substitute at all.  These are very light tasting, which I enjoyed but I worried that others might want a stronger flavor. 

Well chilled dough using a cookie scoop and dropping the dough straight into a bag of powdered sugar changed slow tedious ball formation into a quick and easy process.  I also used the second rack from the top technique to make sure they cracked.

Fudgy, chewy and super easy! Do not overbake - you should try 1 or 2 first to verify the correct baking time for your oven. These cookies lose all their charm (and flavour) when overcooked.

I found the batter impossible to roll into a ball.  I had to drop the spoonfuls of dough directly into the powder sugar to be able to form a ball.  These cookies are pretty, but rather bland for my taste.

I love making Chocolate Kringles. I do however add 2tsp pure peppermint extract for a chocolate peppermint cookie. They are very good and give the cookie a bit more flavor! You can also add orange or raspberry extracts!

I started making them late in the afternoon early in the evening. I’m going to let them set over night. The doe was like brownies. I can’t wait to get them made tomorrow and see how they turn out. Has anyone else let them set over night? If you have how did they turn out.

Wonderful recipe. Like eating a brownie in cookie form. I pressed Hershey's kisses on top as soon as they came out of the oven and then placed cookies in the fridge so the chocolate would keep its form

Awesome recipe! It was my first time making crinkles and these turned out great. I followed everything to the T and when I wasn't using the batter, I placed it back into the fridge. This helped when scooping it out onto the powdered sugar. Will definitely be making this again.

I make these cookies for every social event, and my friends absolutely love them! They have become famous. They absolutely need chocolate chips though. I use about half a bag of unsweetened morsels per batch, but I usually double the batch. This gives them the extra pop they need.

These were super annoying to make and only tasted okay for the effort. I followed another reviewer's advice and dropped the dough right into the powdered sugar for covering. That helped a ton. After two pans in the oven, I added about a quarter cup more cocoa to the batter to: 1. add more chocolate flavor and 2. make them a little easier to scoop and cover. The cocoa helped a ton, but they were still just okay when out of the oven. They looked better and more crinkly too with the additional cocoa. I won't make them again, but my seven year old daughter says they are worth the effort.

Very pretty and easy to make. The reason for 3 stars is that in terms of taste the cookies are not really interesting. They are kind of tasteless and just not "chocolaty" enough. If I make them net time, will add melted bitter chocolate, may-be it will solve the problem.
I changed a few things: 
- reduced sugar to 1.3 cup, next time will reduce more, they are still too sweet.
- replaced the oil with room temperature butter and whipped it with sugar. Worked great, really recommend to ppl like me who hate smelling oil in bakery.
- added 0.5 tea spoon of chilly to enhance the cocoa, it was not enough, next time will add a full spoon.
I let the dough chill well in the fridge before forming the cookies, this made the process easier.

They look exactly like recipe and taste even better. If you let them cool on the sheet pan 3 min then move to cooling rack and cook at 360 they are chewy not too fudgy. They set perfect and i put mix in freezer 1 hr instead of fridge 4hrs and it worked great. There are my new favorite cookie. Cant wait til my friends and family try them.

This recipe is so easy to make, the cookies are moist and delicious. We saved half the dough in the freezer so we will see how that half turns out. Resting on cookie sheet after oven is important.

I thought these turned out great! Followed the recipe exactly and chilled the dough in the fridge. It was a bit sticky but it didn’t bother me. I cooked them on parchment paper and they turned out fabulous! Very pretty cookie!

Very easy to make. They are not as fudgey as I would like, but more cake-like. I cooked them for only 9 minutes and they were stayed moist. I also reduced sugar to 1 1/4  cups and they were plenty sweet.

Excellent recipe, used some tips from previous reviews - freeze 45 min. prior to rolling, I may have left them an extra 5 minutes,.  Saves waiting 5 hours and they don’t stick to hands. I used both 1tbls and 1/2 tbls. to scoop the batter and roll, I preferred the 1/2 tbls they are smaller than the size recommended in the recipe but the cookies  expand and are a nice bite size.  Experimented baking on the second rack from top as a previous review suggested and the middle rack per recipe. Both resulted in crackles, preferred cookie texture from the middle rack and 12 minutes baking. They look beautiful and will be a Christmas regular.

I will definitely make these again! I used 1/2 cup dark chocolate cocoa powder and 1/2 cup regular cocoa powder as opposed to their 1 cup of just regular unsweetened cocoa powder and it made these cookies taste more like dark chocolate brownies. So good! Also, they definitely need to chill for at least 4 hours before making them into little balls otherwise they get sticky.  Great recipe!

I followed the directions exactly. It was a little difficult working with the dough after refrigerating for 2 hours but they came out great. They have a slightly cakey texture with a rich brownie taste. Will definitely be saving this recipe!

This cookies are delicious. My wife used dark cocoa powder. Make sure you use the number 50 scoop. MY wife used a bigger by accident and the cookies spread too much but they were still delicious.

Made as shown except to give it a holiday taste I used 1 teaspoon of peppermint extract in place of 1 teaspoon of the vanilla. They were done in 10 minutes. They rose and crackled nicely. I got 70 out of the 72 they say it will make. I did not have to freeze mine as others suggested. Yes it's a little sticky but not that much. Some suggestions: [1] Use more powdered sugar than shown and make sure the cookie is heavily covered. Once you move them from the cooking sheet to your cooling rack, you can always tap the rack to knock more off. [2] Make sure you are using baking powder and not baking soda. If your cooking isn't cracking that could be the problem. [3] Keep unused portion in the refrigerator until ready to make your next batch to cook. [4] Coat your hands with powdered sugar while rolling into a ball. It's not going to hurt and besides, you're going to put more powdered sugar on them anyways. [5] Be sure to use the parchment paper. I used one sheet per cooking sheet and used that same sheet each time I baked.

Wonderful recipe. Made the recipe as written and turned out great. I found that dropping cookie dough right into the powdered sugar and then rolling into a ball right in the sugar worked best.  These cookies are heavenly, so good that I have already copied the recipe into my own recipe box.

Great recipe, I left my dough in the fridge overnight and started baking in the morning. I probably rolled my balls a little too big AND burned one batch - but still got over 30 perfect and delicious cookies. I followed the recipe but added semi sweet chips and topped half with chocolate mint candy pieces. Will definitely make again.

It seemed bland to me.  I cooked it on parchment paper so it wouldn't stick.  The rest of my family liked it.  I  would add chocolate chips next time.

They look right, but have a funky taste and smell. Maybe it’s because I didn’t bake them long enough. I baked them for 12 min but they are too gooey. I was so excited they looked right after seeing so many people say theirs didn’t, I didn’t bother to check to see if they were done. My bad.

I made these cookies with my grand daughter. They were chocolately, moist and delicious. I tasted one a couple of days later and they were as hard as a rock. 

I don’t know what I did wrong. I stored them in foil and freezer bags.

I made these for an office party and they were a huge hit! The first batch I made didn't look nearly as great as the pictures but I got the hang of it and they turned out amazing. They were a nice change with all the shortbread cookies around for the holiday season. Will definitely make them again!

I only baked these for 8 minutes and that was plenty to keep them soft. Also a few reviewers said to grease pan, I did on the first batch and the bottoms got way to crispy and dark. I used just parchment paper for the remaining batches and they turned out perfect.

This was super easy and fun to make. I used a small ice cream scoop and got about 2 dozen cookies. I also cooked them for 13 minutes because the cookie was larger. 
To help reduce mess, I poured powdered sugar into a large Tupperware dish and dropped ice cream scoops of dough directly into the sugar, sprinkled sugar on top so the dough wouldn't stick to me and then rolled dough into balls. Afterwards, I rolled all the balls in more powdered sugar before placing on greased pans. Wonderful crinkling from this approach and a ton of powdered sugar. 
I'd definitely make this again!

So simple to make and tasty too...
I cut the dough into 3 even pieces and added mint flavor to one, almond to the second and the raspberry to the third.... 
The best part is they all lol the same so it a guessing game which flavor you pick..

Love these cookies.  I do add chocolate chips to the dough and also added espresso powder to really bring out the chocolate flavor.  I make them small for the holidays and jumbo size other times.  I make them every year.

Great cookie!  Easy, good flavor, excellent presentation with a minimal amount of effort.  I chilled the dough as directed and found it very easy to work with.  I didn't have any parchment paper so I just lightly greased the sheets and the cookies came right off the sheet easily. I did have some crushed candy canes so I sprinkled a little on the cookies while they were still warm.  They were delicious: nice crunch outside and chewy inside. Definitely adding these to our Christmas Cookies repertoire!

This recipe really turned out great!  I made it with the addition of 1/4 tsp peppermint oil which i beat into one of the eggs before addicting to the batter.  They taste like Girl Scout thin mints!  I baked them one pan at a time on the second highest shelf setting and the parchment was terrific!  No sticking!  Nice recipe!

I used XL eggs and pure cane sugar as opposed to L and white.  I also made the cookies a bit larger requiring 13 minutes cook time.  Great recipe and perfect appearance to go with fantastic taste!

These will make a great addition to my cookie plates this year. You chill the dough before baking. A little messy to drop into the powdered sugar before baking, but taste great!

I found these to be very sticky when Imtried to make them into balls although I had definitely allowed them to chill quite a long time.  They are also bitter, with a too strong dark chocolate flavor.  I am sorry I tried them.

I've made these countless times over the years and love them. When rolling the dough into balls after chilling, it can be very sticky and messy. I have found the easiest way is to take Pan spray and spray it on your hands before rolling into balls. Works every time for me.  The only thing I dislike is the 4 hour chilling time because i want to bake and eat asap, lol.

I didn't make any changes this time because it was my first time making it. I am going to make it again, but this time I am going to try to do a egg substitute because my mom is vegan now and it hurt her stomach having the egg... didn't stop her from having one every day!!! loved it so much. :)

I made these cookies.. I really didn't think they would actually make cookies, because it was more like brownie dough, not cookie dough.  But, I didn't make any changes, except, I didn't realize it was supposed to chill for 4 hours.  I didn't have 4 hours.. So I put them in the freezer for about half hour, and then kept them in the freezer between batches.. They are very sweet.. A little to sweet, in my opinion.. But they sure are beautiful.   Taking them to church later this afternoon.  Thanks for the recipe.

I enjoyed these cookies. They were a nice chewy texture and had a great taste. The only thing that I had to do differently than the recipe suggested, was that I had to leave them in for ~15 minutes, instead of the suggested 10-12. Other than that, the recipe was very easy to follow and the cookies turned out great!

This recipe turned out amazing! My whole family loved this recipe! I didn't substitute anything big because I felt that the recipe was fine the way it is. My sister is allergic to eggs and dairy so I substituted butter for margarine and used egg replacer instead of eggs. The recipe still tasted amazing!

These cookies are really fun to make! Great for families because it is so much fun to make little balls of dough and coat in powder sugar! I used 3/4 cups of powdered sugar because in my family, the more sugar the better. Hope you all enjoy too!

I did it very well. My concern is that this crinkles is too sweet for someone with slight diabetes. I will do it again but lesser sugar to fit my family with diabetes. Thanks and Cheers!

Delicious cookies! I would give this recipe a 5 star rating if the dough was less sticky and thin, I add to add more flour to solve the problem.

I could highly recommend this crinkles recipe for everyone. It is my first time baking this and I leave it for 4hrs in refrigerator and turns our really nice. The taste and cookie in the middles is so soft and my family really like it.

This recipe was FA - nominal!!!
Looks: 42 stars
Taste: 90 stars
I did not refrigerate for the four hours, and they still turned out fine. So I am not really sure why that was necessary.
BUT all in all nothing bad to say!

These were a 5 for taste but a 1 for presentation. I got super flat cookies, even after accidentally adding an extra teaspoon of baking powder. I only made these because they are dairy-free and a co-worker has a dairy allergy. I have a similar recipe from Paula Deen that uses boxed brownie mix and cream cheese. That will remain my "go-to" for this kind of cookie.

So good they always come out great, but the dough is a lot easier to handle if you but it in the fridge over night which is what i do. 4 hours didn't seem like enough, I have only done that once and ended up putting them back in for longer.

The flavor was fabulous. Very chocolaty. However, even after following the directions exactly as they were written, my cookies did not look at all as nice as the photo at the recipe site. Mine did  not have that snowy mountain top look. Not crispy looking on top or white snowy even though I DID dust with powdered sugar. The powered sugar looked melted. What went wrong??

I have tried this recipe and would like to say that I tweaked it a little too. I used Cadbury's hot chocolate powder, one cup of sugar instead of two and (previous advice from others) I placed the mixture in the freezer for 30 mins then popped it in the freezer again while a batch was cooking in the oven! I love this recipe and will keep coming back each time.

These cookies are delicious and aesthetically pleasing! Usually when I make cookies I have to make them a few times before getting the recipe right, but these have turned out perfectly each time I've made them. They're always a fan favorite among family and friends. This is huge because my husbands family owns a cookie factory. They're literally experts and all they can do is rave about these. Nailed it!

This recipe is great and delicious! I had to make some changes though. I have baked this three times and I finally got the perfect crinkle appearance that I want. First time, the dough was so sticky and will start to melt in my hands. I baked them in a convection oven and they spread too much. Second time, I put the dough in the freezer and it was so much easier to work with but when I baked them, they still looked like the first one that I baked. Just earlier I made this again with all hopes that this will finally turn out great and it actually did! I decided to add 1/4 cup of flour because it's so hot and humid here in the Philippines. I chilled the dough for 4 hours, scooped little balls using an ice cream scoop, put them in an airtight container, and then I put them in the freezer overnight. I baked them using only the bottom heat and I got the perfect cracks that I want. This recipe is so great and they are absolutely yummy! Kinda like a brownie. I will surely make this again and again and again and again...... Haha

These are my FAVORITE cookie! I've used this recipe for years now, unchanged, followed exactly as-is. Love it! I think some helpful tips are: 1. Use two spoons instead of your hands to work the dough into a ball and plop into the powdered sugar. 2. Put the dough back in the fridge between bakes. 3. Put your pan in the fridge/freezer to cook it off before placing a new sheet of cookies on it. The cookies don't turn out well if the dough gets warm from your hands, the pan, or sitting out. Good luck!

My Chocolate Crinkle Cookies came out pretty tasty, but they were flat and did not have the nice cracks like they were supposed to.  I wonder if the egg size played the role here since I used extra large eggs and the dough came out lumpy and sticky even after overnight refrigerated.  I couldn't even form a dough ball with my hands as shown on the instructional video.  It was impossible to use ice cream scoop with this texture, so I had to use two spoon to drop the dough and roll them on powdered sugar one at a time.  And by the time I placed the last powdered dough ball onto the baking sheet, the powdered sugar on the first few dough balls on the baking sheet had already melted into the dough balls.  

When the first tray of cookies came out flat and had no cracks, I tried to chill the next tray of dough balls by placing them in the freezer for a few minutes in hopes that the dough balls would stay in shape and they wouldn't spread out so much or came out flat after baking.  I was wrong.  It still came out flat plus uncooked from the oven that I had to bake them twice.  This, probably because the dough was too cold.

I've been surfing on the way to "fix" this recipe and found that a lot of people suggesting adding a 1/2 ts baking soda to the recipe and rolling the dough balls on granulated sugar first before rolling them on powdered sugar, to keep the moisture from melting the powdered sugar.  However, no one mentioned the egg sizes.  I'd really want to make this cookies agai

Yummy cookies, stay soft for quite a while.  Hands get a little messy when you roll the dough into a ball.  Love the cookies though and the taste!

These are my teenage son's favorite cookie.  He asks for them every year at Christmas. I follow the recipe exactly and come out perfect every time.  The are delightfully fudgy on the inside with a little crunch on the outside. A decadent cookie.

It's so satisfying to see the end result, which is just like the picture. The flavor reminds me of the brownie in a mug recipe with powdered sugar on top. A brownie cookie.

I can see why other reviewers are calling these a bit simple and bland, but with some added peppermint extract, they're great! Mine crackled really well and came out nice. I don't think I'd make them without the peppermint, though. It makes them so much better.

Very good and chocolately.  They came out perfectly.  I added a teaspoon of cinnamon, a pinch of cloves, and a pinch of nutmeg.   I will make these again. Chewy and brownie-like.

this is my first time making these and I wasn't prepared for the consistency...very sticky...seems more like cake batter. I just dropped by spoonfuls into the powdered sugar and rolled into a ball. I baked for 10 minutes and they came out perfect. Immediately after I took out of oven I put a hersheys peppermint kiss in the middle. They looked beautiful for christmas

I followed the advice of other reviewers and chilled the batter for about 45 minutes. Then I rolled each cookie in confectioner's sugar before baking them on silicon pads. The family said they tasted like brownies, and that I had to add them to the Christmas cookie bake list!

Made these for the first time for Christmas baking. Sent a Christmas tin of them to my boyfriend's group at work. No one hesitates to start eating cookies at 9 in the morning and I was instantly receiving praise for them. I wouldn't change a single thing about them, besides the mess I made while making them ??

I made this recipe exactly as written and they came perfect!! Did put them in the refrigerator over night so they were good and chilled. This made for easy scooping. I also used Parchment paper. I sprayed a little Pam on the sheet , put the Parchment down and sprayed a little more Pam and they came off very easy. I did cooked them the whole 12 minutes and got a really nice crackle effect. I started using the small scoop but thought they were a bit big so I used about 3/4 - 1/2 scoop and liked the size better. Nice , fudged, soft center but not gooey! Will keep this recipe!!

Tri d this hoping it was the recipe my family loves but we were all disappointed. Too cakey ! Visited mom and looked at her old recipe card and found the trick: Instead of cocoa powder, melt 4 squares of unsweetened chocolate (microwave works) and add all ingredients to melted chocolate. Yum! Just like Mom used to make! Fudge and delicious!

Great for Christmas, especially for kids that don't like all the cookies with nuts and jam in them.  Great tip was to drop dough into powdered sugar and THEN roll into ball..... less sticky.  We also added some semi sweet chips to the dough.  Will definitely make again.

It was DELICIOUS! Added some chocolate chips, just 1/4 cup and used 2 spoons to help scoop out on to powdered sugar and just shaped using the 2 spoons. Thank you for sharing this recipe, bound to be a HIT!

I used butter instead of oil and baked on a Silpat.  The flavor was pretty good but in the future I would reduce the sugar by at least 1/4 cup and would add 1 teaspoon of expresso powder.

Delicious and easy and definitely a kid-favorite Christmas cookie!  Like other reviewers commented, these are weird.  The consistency of the batter is somewhere between brownie batter and cold hot fudge topping.  It is very gooey in your hands when you roll it, but freezing it and putting back in the freezer between trays helps.  Otherwise, they are very easy to make and turned out beautiful and delicious.

I made these following the directions as stated. They are very good. They are chewy, which we like and very fudgy as well. I did cook them on the second rack down from the top as suggested by another and they were done in 10 minutes and cracked perfectly. I used silpats on the cookie sheets to keep them from sticking and they worked fine. I removed the cookies after 2 minutes to a rack for cooling. They also freeze well so I made them in advance too.

These were delicious!  Almost like flat chocolatey brownies!  I put the dough in the fridge for 20 minutes, then scooped with a small cookie scoop, rolled into balls while wearing gloves and then into the dish of powdered sugar.  Once I had 6 or 7 balls in the sugar I rolled them around and put them on the cookie sheet without shaking any sugar off.  I sifted my p. sugar first with I think gave them a thick even coating.  Baked them on parchment paper and had no problems sticking.  Will make again for sure.

these were so easy.  I made the dough but only baked 12 cookies.  I made 6 covered in powdered sugar and 6 covered in cinnamon sugar.  I replaced the veggie oil with butter because that's what I have on hand.  I will keep the butter in from now on.  the rest of the dough is sitting in my fridge waiting for my next chocolate cravings

The cookies were delicious, and they look like DD munchkins. They weren't as cracked as in the picture, and I didn't add as much powdered sugar. However, the sugar made it look like glaze on a donut, and it was so adorable!

Delicious and tasted like brownies. Pretty too! Like brownies, though, I like them better with some nuts and chocolate chips added. I also recommend erring on the side of underbaking - they will set up as they cool and be more moist.

These worked out okay, very sticky dough though, in fact, I added about 3/4 cup more flour to help make it stiffer, and that worked out fine. I used parchment paper on the pans, and the cookies turned out great and didn't stick and kept the sugar from sticking to the bottom of the cookies. They are very cholately, (not a word, I know), but very good. I used the Nestle's chocolate, and believe that takes some of the edge off the chocolate taste. I will make these again, especially for Christmas giving.

These cookies tasted great but mine were puffy right of the oven but flattened immediately. I used butter instead of oil and keep the rest of the ingredients the same. Next time I will use oil. Smaller size made nicer looking cookies and definitely put the dough in the freezer for at least 1 hour so you can easily handle it.

Love them. Tastes like a soft brownie/cookie. Perfect amount of sweetness. I did make mine larger, so I added more bake time, around 16 minutes total time. Will make again.

These cookies had a fudge like taste & had a nice flavor! ** A note about working with the sticky dough - Moonnoodle's review included this tip: "I put mine in the freezer for about 45 minutes & used spoons to scoop out the dough DIRECTLY into the powdered sugar. Once the dough was in the sugar, they were easy to handle & just plopped into a perfect circle onto the pan."  Also remember, you MUST either use Parchment paper or greased pans... or they WILL stick because of the powdered sugar on the bottom of the cookie. Another reviewer suggested this:  Instead of rolling them in powdered sugar, roll some in regular granulated sugar... then after they come out of the oven, put a Hershey's Kiss on top, then back in the oven for 1min 30 seconds.

I have been looking for this recipe for about 20 years or more. I couldn't find the recipe that was given to me and I couldn't remember the name either. Thanks to a google search. Now I can start making these again. My children when they were little loved these cookies. Looking forward to making them and surprising them.

I actually made these rolled in pure cane sugar instead of powdered. Awesome. Adds a little crunch.

I think these taste like brownies covered in sugar.  Some of the best cookies I've made from this site.  Very easy to make.

I love these cookies but not without a bit of tweaking. I added about 1 cup of chocolate chips just to make them a tad sweeter and 1 teaspoon of peppermint extract (instead of vanilla) and they are the perfect holiday cookies.

I'm not a huge chocolate fan, but this was the perfect blend of chocolate without the overbearing sweetness. I followed another reviewer's advice and put the dough in the fridge between scooping it onto the cookie sheet. I just dumped about 2 cups of powdered sugar in a medium bowl to swirl the cookie balls. Other reviewers stated that their cookies didn't have the nice crinkle effect. I wanted to make sure mine did. The instructions also stated to refrigerate for 4 hours. I only had time for 3, but it didn't  to matter in the end result.

These are excellent! I made them exactly as the recipe required and the tasted so good.  I will bake some for the school cake sale but make them bigger so they are worth 30 pence each when the kiddies buy them at play time.

I added 2 ounces of baking chocolate (melted) to the dough to increase the chocolate flavor.  This dough MUST be chilled thoroughly or it will be next to impossible to shape into balls.  Also, I rolled the balls lightly into granulated sugar and then into the powdered sugar.  This helped to keep the powdered sugar from melting into the dough.

Very good cookie. This recipe produced a caky cookie, almost brownie-like.  We enjoyed the taste.  One thing I do suggest is to chill the dough thoroughly, more than the four hours stated in the recipe.

These cookies were amazing! I make sure to make them every year around Christmas as a treat. The dough can be a bit sticky so definitely place in the refrigerator longer. About 45mins worked. Other than that they are super easy to make and taste great. They remain the same soft texture for days which is great for when you're giving them out in treat bags.

I just made a half of it. Trying to figure out what size of eggs i have to use. But it turned out good. Its so yummy, not chewy, its so moist. U have to look nd check every now and then because it will overcooked and u wouldnt like the hard taste. I was just wondering how it make it round and full shape while mine is just flat and shape like a cookies.. but it doesnt matter as long as the taste is good!

These cookies are really good and really cool looking! But the don't expand as much as it looks. So if you want bigger cookies I suggest making bigger balls of dough.

Love these! They're a delicious little combination of cookies and brownies, and fairly simple to make.

I found they "crinkled" absolutely perfectly when I gave them a generous coating of powdered sugar, then waited until about 3 minutes before they were done... and flattened each one a bit with a spoon (while still in the oven). Baked for 10 minutes total.

I also added a quarter cup of dark and white chocolate chips because some reviewers said they were bland. One of my new favorite cookies.

Have made this recipe several times, following the recipe exactly.  My kids call them "zebra cookies".  They are always soft, chewey, and so very delicious.  I have also made variations where I've added peppermint extract, or coconut extract.  Also very delicious.

This is a very good receipe one thing that I've notice was my cookie didn't flatten, instead of cookie shape my crinkle turned into a dome shape, may be next time it will just flatten it a bit but i will sure do it again , I made it for the first time and my husband loves it!!

This simple cookie delivers a fudgy, brownie-like flavor. Why haven't I made these before!? My family gets a lot of home-baked cookies, and this was a HUGE hit. The bonus: This recipe works beautifully at high altitudes.

Good tasty chocolate they were easy to make, I made larger cookies and find them very soft, almost cake like inside with a nice crisp on the outside.  Good recipe Thanks.

I made them today 4/7/2016 and they are great kids love them I love them
Why would people say things like they were not like the ones down the street? They are not the same so go to you where ever and get the ones that are not as good because these are GREAT!!! And if I was eating them at some roach café I would not tell anyone!!!

Very yummy and fudgey  I used dark cocoa and they turned out great. Tip: after rolling into a ball and coating with the powdered sugar, slightly flatten the dough for better uniform cookie shape

We followed the recipe exactly as described, and they baked up just as pretty as the picture. However, the flavor was bland -- all we could taste was cocoa. Very one note, very disappointing.

This recipe was great! Crunchy on outside and chewy and fudgy on the inside. I froze my dough for 2 hours and kept it in the freezer between batches. I dropped my dough right into the powdered sugar, rolled in a ball, and then rolled it in more sugar. The first batch I cooked 10 minutes and they were a little underdone, still delicious though. The rest of the batches were cooked for 12 min and came out perfect. I only got 4 dozen out of this recipe. Will certainly make again!

I made these with my kids.  Perfect.  So good.  I burned the bottoms of one batch, but that was my fault.  I put less powdered sugar on them and liked them more than if they were coated.

These cookies tasted really good but mine came out flat.  I was  surprised because I put them in the freezer before  cooking them.  Since my son cannot eat dairy I liked that this recipe is dairy free.

My 12 yr old made these.....we call them Brownie Crack cookies!!  I don't know what happened to others' reviews but these were outstanding.  She made them a little smaller than normal cookies and there had to have been at least 60 cookies.  We refrigerated the 1st half of the batch for about 3 hrs and put the rest of the batter in the fridge until the next afternoon when she made the rest.  This is a keeper!!!

My daughter and I love these cookies. They are very messy though. I've made them with and without the Hershey kisses. Yummy either way. I didn't make any changes to the recipe but here are my tips;

1. definitely need to refrigerate the dough (I do it over night)
2. damp hands when rolling (it's very sticky & tenacious!)
3. coat dough balls with plenty of powdered sugar
4. I used my pizza stone, no need for parchment paper
5. I cooked them for 13 minutes, came out perfect.
6. Don't put back in the oven if you use the kisses

I love the recipe,but it makes a small amount(maybe 24 pieces), so if you really want 72 pieces you should double the recipe but not in the same bowl;in another bowl. thanks for the recipe.

Okay, so I'm a total sucker for chocolate and when I found this recipe I was so excited! And I had reason to be. These are great for any occasion and always turn out. But when you are storing them, put into a super tight air lock container so they don't turn into rocks. :D

I found the recipe in the magazine. Everyone who tried them loved them the first time I made them. Tonight I rolled them in peppermint flavored granulated sugar. They smell amazing coming out of the oven. Can't wait to try them!!!

They're great and everything, but the dough is SOOO sticky it's impossible to touch it or anything like that. If you like crunchy cookies, put them in the oven for waaaaaay longer than the recipe says. I personally hate squishy cookies like these, and they are super dark tasting, but I'm sure other people will like them more!

I realized this am before baking that I added 2 tsp of Baking Soda instead of Baking Powder. I baked these as the directions state and they came out perfect. I chilled for 24  hours and had no problem with them sticking to my hands. I also coated 1 batch with Cinnamon Sugar suggested in another review and they are delicious. I will be adding nuts next time.

Very good!! Just a tip.... Coat the heck out of them in the powdered sugar.. I mean lots of it! Or it melts away and also make sure to chill the batter or they won't roll into balls

These are defined five star and easy to make cookies. Follow directions. If u forget like I did once that they need to chill. One hour uncovered in freezer will do the trick to. I used. Organic canola oil instead. I used all organic.  I used Hershey cocoa which is not organic.  Every body all different ages first bite they said wow these r good.  Some compared them to brownies. U do not need to press balls down. Easy to do w kids.

Followed the recipe to a T and followed one reviewer's suggestion to bake one cookie sheet at a time on the second row from the top. The cookies turned out perfectly - crinkled, and gooey yet crispy on the outside. Everyone that tried them raved about them. These are definitely a new staple in my cookie list! 

I did cook them about 4 minutes longer than the suggested time (not sure if my oven is a bit different than everyone else's but they were underdone when I pulled them out at the suggested time).

This recipe is AMAZING! I have always looked for a nice cookie recipe for a way to communicate with my brother (he has autism). And I think that this is one of those recipes! My whole family loves these cookies! I did add 2 teaspoons of vanilla, and also I chilled if for about 2 to 3 hours, if I did it for 4 hours, the batter would have turned into a solid.

They turned out beautiful and delicious! Next time I would add a little more sugar to the dough, but they were pretty much perfect. Thick, chewy, and chocolatey.

I follow the recipe exactly, and use 1/2 cup dark chocolate cocoa and 1/2 cup baking cocoa.  I bake them for exactly 9 minutes, which makes them soft and fudgy and delicious!  My husband requests these every Christmas, and this recipe never disappoints.

I loved these! very simple and easy. It's a very good time killer recipe if you make the batter in advance. I feel like these would be very good with semi sweet chocolate chips in them or walnuts!

These were delicious! I omitted the powdered sugar, since I didn't have any, and they didn't need it.
I would like to add that the final result will depend on what type of cocoa powder you use. Not all cocoa powders taste the same.

Tried this recipe for the first time.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I did do a triple batch because I bake a lot of cookies for Christmas.  I let the dough sit overnight in the refrigerator and scooped it in balls, rolled them in powdered sugar and slightly flattened them.  I baked only one tray at a time in the oven and baked on a higher shelf, as suggested by someone else.  They cracked and baked perfectly.  I did use the pre-cut cookie parchment sheets, which made for an easy clean up.  You definitely don't want to overbake these cookies or they get hard.

My mom made these cookies when I was a youngster (now 67) and they were always a family favorite. There is one difference in her recipe, 4 squares of unsweetened chocolate instead of the cocoa powder. Melt the chocolate and follow the recipe as written. 
Optional: Add your favorite nuts

well, I copied the recipe,  and doubled it.  it was very very dry so I added another 1/2 cup of oil.  still dry.  went back to the computer and saw that I left out the eggs.  so now I add 8 eggs and it's like fudge.  I was still able to bake these and they turned out just like brownies.  in fact, I can't see any difference.  next time, I would just make brownies, it would bee much easier to cut out of a pan.   I don't eat sweets myself, they are for Christmas cookies, i'm sure they will be a big hit.

I make tons of these every Christmas because my cousins (and I have a lot of them) devour these by the plateful. So I've picked up a few things that personally work for me. Here are my tips: 

To prevent sticking, I make sure my cookies are completely covered in icing sugar and I rub the sheets down with icing sugar before putting the balls down too.

I recommend making the batter a day before the cookies are needed, and refrigerating over night or even longer. I double wrap the batter ball in saran wrap to keep in the moisture.

To get the icing sugar to actually stay on in a thick coat and to get a nice crinkle, I first roll the ball in regular granulated sugar before rolling it in icing sugar. To simplify the process, I get a spoon and wear a plastic glove. I spoon out a bit of batter, push it off into a bowl of granulated sugar with my gloved finger, roll it, take it out, then roll it in a separate bowl of icing sugar. I put the ball straight onto the sheets and bake for the minimal time- 10 minutes. Then I let the cookies cool until they are stiff enough for me to lift the whole sheet off and place on the counter so I can reuse the tray with a new sheet.

Not a professional, so if you don't agree with my tips, then just don't use 'em. Your call. Best of luck!

I did add double the amount of vanilla and a bit more chocolate - about 1/4 cup more dark European chocolate (which I used throughout the recipe) and they were glorious. My kid's class loved them! Not one came back from school.

These are my number one requested cookie.  I lost my recipe and have searching for a really good replacement.  Most of what I've found produces a flat, crispy cookie without enough chocolate.

I want a real chocolaty taste  so I  made a slight change, adding  1/2 c. melted semi-sweet chocolate with the cocoa, sugar, and oil.  I also rolled them in baker's sugar before the confectioner's sugar.

These were almost perfect.  I'd like them to spread a little less, but they tasted so good.  Moist with just the right amount of chocolate.

It is super runny out of the mixer, so you absolutely must sufficiently chill the dough.  I put it in the frig overnight.   

I slightly wet my hands before rolling.  The dough stuck to my hand less and the sugar stuck to the ball better.  I also put the dough back in the frig between batches.  

 I rotate the sheet at the halfway point and found the baking time was more 15-20 mins.

I highly recommend this version.

I followed the recipe exactly and they came out PERFECT. Mine crinkled fine though I did bake them on the top rack of my oven like one person suggested jut to be on the safe side.
  Next time I might add some chocolate chips for my son.  Only because he had tried one of the gluten free ones I made for my mother-inlaw which had chocolate chips in it first, and then tried these and he said they where not chocolatey enough, lol.

Everything they're advertised to be!  Pretty, easy to make and taste like a brownie.  I followed the advice of another reviewed and doubled the batch to make half as chocolate crinkles and rolled the other half in plain white sugar and pressed a hug into them when they came out of the oven.  Both cookies look pretty on my Christmas tray.

Amazing recipe! I adjusted the ingredients a little and it turned out great! I used dutched processed cocoa and they turned out almost completely black, plus I baked them for about 10 minutes and they have the best, brownie-like fudgy consistency and I just absolutely love that! Thanks for the recipe, I intend on keeping it close for the future.

I made these today and although I only had a little more than 1/2 a cup of cocoa powder, I substituted a bar of 86% dark chocolate cocoa bar using slightly less sugar than called for and they were perfect.  Crinkled perfectly and are chewy on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside.  They are absolutely delicious!!! We are taking them to the annual Christmas party at the U.S. Embassy tomorrow along with the Russian tea cakes and Buckeyes III from allrecipes.com as well.  Thanks to all the submissions for such great recipes!!!

I loved these cookies! I did all the tips, put the cookies on the second rack in the oven, lots of powdered sugar, made sure dough was very chilled...thanks for the tips everyone. I put my powdered sugar in a zip-lock bag and dropped spoonfuls of dough in and shook the bag really coating each spoonful of dough- super easy and less messy!

This recipe is nearly exactly like one I have been trying to find from childhood. I live in a very humid climate, so will add my two cents: Divide the batter in two and leave half in fridge (I will do the freezer next time) until finished with first half.  Expect the sugar to sort of melt into the cookie.  I tried to compensate by rolling extra thickly in the sugar & while that did help, it also added an extra layer of sweetness that I did not like. I had an oddball bar of chocolate that I crumbled into the batter and will now make that part of the recipe.  Lastly,  run a spatula under the cookies very quickly or they stick.

Holy hotcakes these are good cookies! The prep is quite a pain as its time consuming to keep rinsing hands, rolling balls and then throwing mix back in fridge while cookies are baking, but man oh man it's worth it! I let the mix sit in the fridge overnight.  As others have said, keep hands moist to prevent a sticky mess. I would roll, throw the ball in a bowl with powdered sugar and then use a slotted spoon to roll it around and place on cookie sheet. I got 60 cookies, 55 after 5 disappeared into my belly. The balls were a bit over an inch and I cooked for 11.5 minutes. Perfection!

These are awesome. The end result is going to be determined by the brand of ingredients used. I used Guittard cocoa powder.  White Lily flour (which has a higher protein content). Plugra butter. Nielsen-Massey vanilla. Chilled the dough overnight. Used a 1/2 tablespoon metal spoon dipped in confectioners sugar to scoop the dough. Rolled them in a bowl. Mine took 12 minutes. They will look like they aren’t cooked enough but will be. Let them cool on the cookie sheet. I covered my sheet with parchment paper. These were great. Don't use Hershey cocoa powder!

At first I was sceptical about making these because of the reviews that had complaints about it tasting bland. I followed the recipe without making any changes. The only downside for me was the four hour chill time. I could've left it overnight but I woke up at 2 am just to bake them (weird right??). And I don't regret it one bit! I loved them!!! Especially when warm. I found it a bit too sweet so I'll cut down the sugar next time by maybe 1/4-1/2 cup. But other than that, it was great. I would definitely make it again.

I had to add more flour and yet they were still incredibly sticky. Like I added close to 2 cups of flour extra.   It was like a former person rated it.  Like cake batter, not cookie dough.
not overly impressed with this.
:(

Love this recipe. Worked out great! One bowl, no mixer needed. I also added cinnamon because I'm not a fan of mint or peppermint and chocolate but wanted it holiday tasting. Will definitely make these again!

These cookies were splendid. They were rich and delicious...... I loved them! When I made them the dough was not gooey at all. In fact I put them in the freezer for 45 minutes even though I really didn't have to but they still came out amazing! Again everyone who tried these said they were just amazing!

I made the dough two ways. Some with the powder sugar on them and some I rolled in regular sugar and added a Hershey Kiss on top.  I found them both wonderful.  If you want something that is really rich try the ones with the kiss.   I will make these again.  I doubled the recipe and I didn't have a scoop and I ended up with about 7 dozen .

Delicious!  I followed the recipe and directions almost exactly and they turned out as they should have!  When I scooped the dough (using a cookie scoop) I put the ball of dough directly into the powdered sugar. I didn't roll the dough, other than rolling  it around in the sugar. It was enough because their shape was perfect!  I'm not sure why some had trouble with their cookies not cracking. The only reason I can think of is that maybe the dough wasn't chilled long enough?  Mine was in the fridge overnight.  They were round, just enough chocolate flavor, and they crinkled. Perfect!

Easy to make and not overwhelmingly sweet. I used a 1/2 T to scoop out the cookies and they were the perfect size for little hands. I did the overnight chill and they were very easy to work with. Just be certain to really coat these with the powdered sugar. I'm making more right now!

Awesome. The cookies are like a fudgie brownie bite.   I made them exactly as written.  I had no problems with the cookie  crinkling or with it sticking to my parchment. I tried one cookie sheet with the balls slightly flattened before baking.  I liked them that way a bit better.  I baked them for 10 minutes and left them on the cookie sheet until I needed to reuse the cookie sheet.  I will definitely be making these again.  Thank you for a great recipe!

I found this recipe after a friend requested the cookie. It is easy to make the dough and I opt to refrigerate over night. I also drop the dough onto to parchment lined cookie sheets to be sure I have equally sized cookies, wash my hands to get the dough off and then I go back and shape the cookie dough by slightly rolling it in my palms before putting it in the powder sugar. I also bake them at 325 with convection turned on. So good!

These turned out great!! I put in freezer for only 45 minutes and didn't have a problem with the dough being sticky. I also took advise from others to add peppermint extract instead of vanilla (as I love peppermint patties). Yes, I would make them again, they are one of my favorite and so easy to make.

The flavor was great (with 1 cup milk chocolate chips added), but the dough was really hard to work with. It was sticky even after chilling overnight. I ended up using a spoon to scoop, another spoon to scrape the dough off the first spoon, and a third spoon to pour powdered sugar over the dough so I could have a spot to touch so I could finish rolling it in the sugar. There was no touching the dough without being covered in it, and I certainly could not have rolled the dough in sugar after touching it - it would have turned into an even stickier mess.

I really liked this recipe - and they look just like they do in the picture.  It's hard to tell when they are done, and I found them under-cooked at 10 minutes.  In my oven it seems that 14 minutes is about right.  I would roll the balls and then have my kids roll them in the icing sugar, a new family favorite!!

Some of the old recipes for 'these' cookies also have instant coffee in them, I like the fact that this recipe does not.  They came out both beautiful and moist - a WINNER!!!  We baked on a 'silpat', so saved my parchment paper.  Obviously, we did not have time to refrigerate  for 4 hrs, so we took the same shortcut others did and took advantage of the freezer for 45 minutes.  Worked out perfectly.  Happy Baking!

Tastes great- made about 2 dozen cookies for me.  I was very generous on the powdered sugar stage and even sprinkled more on top of the cookies immediately after removing from the oven.  Also the rolling ball stage was very sticky, even after 4 hours in the fridge.  Next time, I might try keeping it in the fridge overnight.

I loved mixing it and preparing it! but sadly rolling it into balls was quite hard and some of them fell apart in my hands, wasted! I only managed to make seventeen.
Wouldn't reccommend unless you were okay with being messy!
When baking, I ran into some difficulties. They became very flat and wide, other touching each other.

I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfect. My family loved them! I found them a bit too sweet, but still good. The only thing I did differently was to drop the dough into the powered sugar before I tried to roll it into a ball because of how sticky it was. It is much easier to work with when the dough is cold. Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

Tasted delicious! I only refrigerated these for an hour and a half before molding and cooking, instead of the recommended four hours, and the shape and crinkle was on point still. To help with handling the sticky batter I just powdered my hands with the powdered sugar. I cooked the minimum recommended time and rotated the pan half way through to ensure an even bake.

I have a similar recipe. When I make these, friends & family will be on my doorstep. My recipe calls for butter & unsweetened chocolate bars instead of oil & cocoa. The batter is pretty thick. It must be kept cold when you're making the cookies, too. The confectioners sugar seems to coat them better & it's easier to roll into balls as well. I make the cookies a little larger than this recipe & start checking them about 8 minutes after I put them in the oven. I take them out when they still look a little under done, like a soft brownie. The cookies will bake a little more on the baking sheets while cooling. This cookie is SOOO much better a little fudgey.

Excellent! My cookies came out looking gorgeous, and stayed that way- didn't flatten out or sink.  Good flavor as well.

So yummy, but I made a happy mistake when making them. I accidentally put the icing sugar in to the batter, the cookie centers are more like fudge. I still rolled the Un-baked cookies in icing sugar.... They are one awesome cookie

This is a lovely, brownie-like batter that lends itself well to modifications. I used Dutch cocoa, which made them dark and very chocolaty and took another reviewer's advice and did 1 tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp of mint extract. Super, super good! I had no trouble getting them to crackle. I made up the batter, left it covered on the front porch for about 4 hours, (the beauty of a MN winter...front-porch-as-refrigerator) and used my Tablespoon measuring spoon to scoop them out and into a bowl of powdered sugar. My boys were able to help by swirling the dough balls in the sugar, coating them nicely. Even my two year old was able to help. I found that 12 minutes left them chewy and moist in the middle, and 13 minutes left them dry in the center, but not in a bad way, just in a cooked all the way through thoroughly kind of way. Great recipe. It makes a TON of cookies, too. I got about 40 Tbsp sized cookies out of the batter. Don't be alarmed if the batter looks thin and cake-like at first. The chilling will firm it up and delicious things will happen!

A go-to recipe for me--I've it at least 20 times as written except I don't usually have time to chill it the full 4 hours. 

Vegan friendly version: use water instead of egg (2 TBS in place of 1 egg is what I did) and coconut oil instead of veg oil for extra flavor.  You won't get that same pretty "crinkled" or "cracked" effect with this version.  They just flatten out instead.  If you roll them in powdered sugar before baking, the sugar will just soak into the cookie and it will look like you never did it at all.  So, I did not roll them in sugar beforehand but instead dusted them with powdered sugar using a sieve after they were cooled.

The key to making these black is using black cocoa. I do half black and half Dutch. It's a family favorite at Christmas. Refrigerating overnight for a nice stiff dough.

I make this as the recipe call for. It always turns out great. The last time I made them I had a small cookie scoop and I changed the time to 10 minutes and it was perfect for the size. Everyone who taste these cookies loves them. I love that reaction.

My hubby and our friend liked it they said that its not dry and not too sweet... I believed it depends on what kind of cocoa you are using. I use dutch process cocoa to make this...and i use silicon baking mat so it doesnt stick even if you leave it there..I absolutely and will make this again..

this seems to be a good recipe that is why I rated it as 5 stars. However, I need help troubleshooting because my doughs wont stay dense and tends to expand x5 the original size! I followed the instructions well. I used a dutch cholocolate cocoa powder (unsweetened) but it just wont stop expanding! I'm just a beginner and would really appreciate it if anyone can help. Thanks!

Very easy recipe! The cookies are delicious and very chocolately You definitely need to refrigerate the dough for at least 4 hours or longer. The colder the dough the easier it is to work with and roll in the powdered sugar.

Worked perfectly! They taste amazing and look amazing too. Instead of refrigerating the dough for 4 hours, I just put mine in the freezer for 45 min. The dough was sticky when I rolled it into balls, but that's to be expected. Everyone who ate the cookies loved them. :D Definitely recommended!

Requested every Chistmas! One cookie that is super easy to ship (very sturdy). A few minor suggestions. For those that are complaining about weak flavor - you must use great quality cocoa. Cheap store brand won't cut it here. Also, try looking for instant espresso and adding 1/2 - 1 tsp. It deepens the chocolate flavor. And to top it off, I add 1 cup of mini chocolate chips for a perfect chocolately cookie!

This was absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe/instructions exactly and it was fabulous! I made it two times, in fact! Be careful though, unless you're sure that your mixer can handle a really thick mix, then I would advise being extra careful. I actually broke my mixer trying to make this, underestimating the thickness of the mixture. I prefer to hand-mix this recipe, but I love it so much that I still rate it 5-stars!

I bake cookies for a canteen and this recipe has gone down a storm with the customers, demand has completely outstripped supply.  However, I would appreciate some expert advice.  When the mix comes out of the refrigerator I struggle to get a cookie scoop into the dough, it is so hard.  I tried rolling balls of dough in my hands but it just turned into a sticky mess.  Any ideas from you experts?

I loved this as a base recipe. I made a few changes to the recipe to give it a more chocolaty flavor:

on a double boiler, I melted 2 cups of dark belgian chocolate.....once melted, I blended it with 1/2 a cup of butter, then added 2 teaspoons of madagascar vanilla. I also added 1/8 teaspoon of chili powder for a kick (you don't taste it but your cookie will have a deeper flavor  :)) 

Next add 2 c of sugar, then your 4 eggs

I used 1 3/4 c of flour with 2 teaspoons of baking powder and the 1/2 teaspoon of salt...I sifted the dry ingredients together a few times before adding to the wet. 

Chill in the fridge for a couple of hours. Once out, roll your cookies into a ball with about an 1 1/4 inch in diameter and roll that sucker in powdered sugar....just completely dunk and roll. You'll get a nice crinkled look once you take them out of the oven. They should look like white powdery truffles before you bake them :) 

When it came to baking time, I would let the cookies bake for about 8 minutes...when they are underdone. This will make sure they stay insanely soft! Cool them on a wire rack and enjoy :)

Delicious just as is! I added a couple drops of peppermint oil to half the recipe (dad prefers vanilla, I prefer mint). Chilled in freezer for 45 mins. Dropped by half tbsp fulls in confectioner's sugar and baked on the second to top rack for 8 mins.

Definitely more like a fudge brownie than a cookie. I only kept them in for 8 minutes on the second to top rack. After they set/cool, they are really gooey in the middle and taste like a super moist brownie. Like the other users said, I used a pan with Pam spray and made sure to get enough powdered sugar on them. Great recipe. I might try adding nuts next time (walnuts or almonds).

I've been wanting to make these cookies for a while now and they're the perfect recipe. They're a brownie in cookie form and I would recommend this recipe to anybody! So delicious. Though next time I'm going to add chocolate chips to make them a little more moist ??

These were so delicious! I made a few batches and gave some to a friend of mine, who remarked that these were his favorite cookies ever, and that he hasn't had them in years! He loved them so much in fact that he was a glutton about them and wouldn't share! Making more for my son's Science Olympiad dinner tomorrow!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe! They come out perfect every time, cracked on top and a fudge brownie like consistency! Like others suggested, I put the dough in the freezer for about 45 to 60 minutes....only because I was too impatient to wait the 4 hours! ;-) Thank you so much for the great recipe. My friends and family thank you also!

I followed the recipe to the letter, but I found it to be a bit boring - next time I'll try to spice it up or add some things to make eating it a more interesting experience. But the texture was just wonderful and they were nice and chewy, so I'll definitely give them another go with improvements.

Loved this recipe! Made them for the Christmas Cookie Trays I made this year and it was a huge hit. They were soft in the middle which I enjoyed very much. The only thing I did different from the recipe here was substitute the vanilla extract with peppermint extract. If you have children I would recommend having them help roll the balls in confectioners sugar. My two year old had a blast helping!

The cookies are beautiful and taste good. I added 1/2 teaspoon of peppermint which gave it a hint of mint flavor. I wish I had used cherry flavor instead. I would really like to find a way to add a mar. cherry to the dough w/o the confectioners sugar. But, the dough was really hard for me to work with. I used scoops, tablespoons, teaspoons. Ended up throwing away the last 1/3 of the batter. It was easier when the dough was colder. Probably should have just refrigerated.

These are always a hit in my family. Make sure your hands are cold when rolling the cookies into balls. I always undercook them slightly so that they are soft and chewy. They are best the day they are made.

My cookies came out perfect.  Texture, taste and appearance were exactly as expected. I replaced vanilla with peppermint extract and added mini chocolate chips and chopped Andes mints.  Now I have to stop eating them and save some for everyone else!

Took out half a cup of sugar. Stuck dough in stainless steel metal bowl and popped in deep freezer for 45 minutes. Spooned dough into powdered sugar before rolling into balls.

I made these last night and followed the recipe exact only I substituted 1Tsp peppermint extract for the vanilla. Husband & 2 grown kids love them! My only reason for 4 stars instead of five is because I rolled into 1" balls and they spread out so they are larger than the ones in the picture. Next time I will get a melon baller and use that as I think the 'crinkle' will look better on a smaller cookie. I have to say this made a lot of cookies though! 4 dozen?! This is a bit messy to make....could be easier w\a helper to roll in sugar while someone scoops the balls out of the dough! Also I did stick the dough/batter in the freezer for an hour and I used parchment paper which all worked out fine! I will definitely make again!

Things of note:
- the recipe is for 1" balls which makes very small cookies as they do not spread out
- the dough is very cake-y / moist / sponge-y FYI

Not necessarily bad things just different than I have had in the past. :-) 

Make sure you really press the balls into the powder well, leaving it chunky, so when they crack you have an opaque layer of white powder. They look a lot better that way.

WOW! These cookies were so moist and yummy. I even followed somreones review and made two different cookies with the batter. I rolled some in regular sugar and as soon as I took them out of the oven I put Hersey kisses with almonds in the middle and they were amazing too! I will be making these every year! Thank you for these awesome cookies! Also I like a lot of powdered sugar so I just kept pouring as I rolled them. To making baking easier I always make my dough the day before so it isn't overwhelming.

I just made these and they are sooo good! I am not too big on chocolate but these are so good. I know my hubby will LOVE them! He is the chocolate feind. I am hoping that stored in a tin will be ok, I don't want them to dry out but am a little worried they'll become gooey...?

These cookies are "just okay".  
The recipe makes beautiful cookies that aren't too sweet.
However, the addition of some espresso powder (~2 tsp) would greatly help boost the chocolate flavor.
I would also prefer the inside of the cookie to be less chewy and more cake-like.

They taste like chocolate fudge brownies and look beautiful. I used half a cup of sugar and it works. I kept the dough in a metal mixing bowl in the fridge overnight. it made rolling the dough into balls very easy. Beautiful looking cookies and delicious.

Batter was easy to make, I was impatient but I waited the 4 hours (for the cookies to chill) but the batter was sticky and I would agree with the suggestions to put the batter in the freezer for a half hour then scoop the batter onto the powdered sugar because the heat from my hands warmed the batter and caused it to become sticky. However, just what I expected; came out great with the crinkle and everything!

I was so excited to make these based on all the positive reviews but I'm quite disappointed. They turned out beautifully, just like the pictures. I followed the advice of freezing the dough first and they were a breeze to make but they don't have much flavour. I had added a teaspoon of expresso powder in a preemptive effort to intensify the chocolate flavour and even put a chocolate chip on top but that wasn't enough sadly. I should have listened to "luckygirl". Now I'm trying to figure out how to salvage them...maybe use them for ice cream sandwiches...

If you do insist on making these, I suggest adding a cup of white or semisweet chips to the batter.

I love this recipe!!!! A customer brought a cookie tray into my work a few years ago and it had some cookies like this.  Searched and searched til I found this recipe, which looked just like the cookies I saw. These are soooo good.  Made them for our Christmas cookie exchange at work last year and everyone else loved them too. Needless to say, I will be making them again this year for the cookie exchange (and of course some extras for us at home!!).

These are incredible! So good and moist. I couldnt wait for them to cool. I only yielded about 40 but that's because i used a table spoon to pick them up and make the ball. Next time only a tsp. yummy yummy in my tummy!

Update. I just made them 2015 and I yielded 52 making them with a tbsp measuring spoon. Getting better!

I followed the recipe exactly. I put them in the fridge for 5 hours and the dough was still very sticky.  I used a cookie scoop and they turned our huge and flat! I tossed that batch and made them half the size. They still spread and were huge, flat disks. I started putting the dough in the freezer between batches. This did help reduce the stickiness. I ended up using a teaspoon as a scoop and they were about the size of a nickel. They were normal size cookies, but still flat as a pancake!! They definitely didn't look like any of the pictures posted. I'm not sure what I did wrong. I definitely won't be trying this recipe again.

I've seen other chocolate crinkle recipes that you have to melt chocolate I love this one because it uses Cocoa powder. Just remember not to overbake them.  So fudgy and good!

Delicious!  i usually never stray from a recipe the first time but decided to add a tiny bit (1/4tsp) of almond extract because the dough tasted a little bland.  I also only had dark cocoa on hand.  Great recipe to make with a child - my 5 year old rolled the balls in the sugar which helped a lot since you need to work fast otherwise the dough gets sticky.

Change nothing! These are great and so beautiful. I followed other reviewers' advice to ensure they crinkle and make life easy. The tips consolidated: I chilled for 2 hours and was fine. Last 30 min in freezer. Put bowl back in freezer as each bath cooks. Only put one tray in oven at a time to keep heat evenly dispersed and ensure a great crinkle. Use a cookie scoop but not too big. If you drop cookies into small bowl with powdered sugar, it's sooo much easier. Toss them around to coat fully and place on the cookie sheet. Cook the full 12 minutes. Only cool one minute on the sheet so they don't stick to the wax paper. Thanks for the tips, everyone!! Will make over and over.

I went by the recipe completely besides I only had 1 teaspoons vanilla extract.
They came out perfect and they look so pretty!!! The dough will become hard to mix and its very sticky after you take it out of the frig. It's a chewy type of cookie. I'm making the whole family these for xmas.
+UPDATE+ I made these for xmas for everyone and they LOVED it and asked for the recipe.

I made the dough as directed (adding just a tiny bit of ovaltine) and froze the dough for about 45 minutes like other reviews suggested. I tried using a spoon to drop into the powdered sugar then rolling into balls, and I also tried rolling into balls first then coating in the powdered sugar. The first way wasn't as messy but the cookies didn't always stay in a ball very well. I didn't have parchment paper so I sprayed the cookie sheets with cooking spray. I did make most of the cookies too big and now I know they should be small, like the recipe says. Still very good though!

this is a good recipe, though i made some changes, i use this as a format, cause i dont like my food too sweet, besides, it will have a confectioner sugar coating it too so, i reduced the sugar with 1/2 cup from the ingredients instead of using 2 cups, i also use 3/4cup of super dark cocoa and just 1/4 of the classic cocoa.

my son loves these! Only thing I did different is add some powdered espresso powder to batter, it deepens the chocolate flavor.  And I double roll the cookies, drop uneven ball in powdered sugar, roll by hand and then roll in the sugar again.  I have bought the box mix from Ghiradelli they sell at Aldi's around the holidays and have been looking for a way to recreate them year round, thank you!

Really great cookie recipe...I love how chocolatey it is. I made my batter the night before and placed in the fridge to chill overnight. Here's a tip, in case your worried about the stickiness of the batter when your rolling these cookies out then plop them right in the powdered sugar before rolling

I remember these from my childhood and they tasted just the same!  I followed the directions exactly.  I cooked them for 11 minutes and that was enough.  I used wax paper.  Not sure if that is different from parchment paper however some of the cookies did stick.  Next time I will spray down the paper.  When my husband tried them he asked me if it was a new way to make brownies.

So here's the deal. The dough was utterly impossible to work with - soooo sticky, we had to add more and more and more flour just to be able to form cookies. But once we baked them, the cookies were delicious. Would I make them again? No way. But they do taste good.

I made these at Christmas.  One batch was not enough.  Made them again in January, two batches, not enough.  Made them again in March, five batches and was requested to make more.  How's that for the best cookie ever???

I'm not a big cookie-baker, and wanted to make something chocolate, using cocoa, and ingredients I had on hand without going to the store. These were fantastic! Delicious , attractive , foolproof. I chilled the dough for 4 hours and it was still quite sticky to work with.  The solution was to dust my hands and the melon baller I used as a scoop with powdered sugar, worked perfectly ( with the help of a mini-spatula). i added crushed walnuts for a brownie type taste. Next time I want to add dried cranberries. Best right out of the oven while hot !

I baked the first batch for 11 minutes and the next for 9. Second batch came out perfect. My kids love them. Created an account today just so I could give 5 stars lol! Be sure to grease the pan or they will stick big time. Didn't like how they came out with wax paper so I put them directly on greased cookie sheet, worked great.

I used one less egg and half the oil and these turned out fudgy in the middle and crispy on the outer part, I recommend these for parties/tea parties or for just a chocolate craving.

GREAT recipe. I love the flavor and it is one of the chocolate crinkle cookies I like. The only downside is that it takes quite a while, but if you have time, definitely worth it.  It has a twist on a regular chocolate cookie, which Is great for a party. I brought them in for a school gathering and everyone loved them!!! Perfect for chocolate lovers.

These tasted great! Even though I only "chilled" the dough for about 15 minutes... What happened was that it stayed very gooey and becomes difficult to roll in the sugar. However, after some very sticky chocolaty fingers and a mess i was able to get the goo rolled into the sugar and baked! Yum :) Next time I will definitely chill the dough for longer though as the recipe indicates!

These cookies were delish! They were similar to brownies in fudginess, but were great nonetheless. The batter was a bit sticky, but I'm used to making truffles, so it wasn't a big deal for me. I don't know where people went wrong with the hardness, because these were soft. Will be making again during the holidays, and I'll add the peppermint extract as suggested! I only added a tiny pinch more of salt to the batter to kick up some of the flavor, as I was afraid it would be a bit too bland. Worked out beautifully.

I made these exactly as directed (although I used aluminum foil with cooking spray instead as I didn't have any parchment paper and it worked beautifully).  They were delicious!  I am currently eating dairy free as I'm nursing a young baby with a sensitivity to dairy and these are a delightful treat that didn't mess with baby's tummy.  Yum!

I've made this recipe yesterday! I only put it in the freezer for like 2 1/2 hrs and it tuned out great! For chocolate crinkles these r great! They taste like brownies, but they taste good! They are very pretty, a great gift to wrap and give! In use parchment paper and it got off perfectly!

I got 3 dozen cookies using a 1-tablespoon cookie dough scooper which I baked for 10-11 minutes. Make sure that the dough is COLD (freeze for 50 minutes) and coat with LOTS of powdered sugar (the chocolate color shouldn't be visible underneath). I scooped the dough and dropped it directly into the powdered sugar, then rolled the top and sides around. It has a moist, fudgey inside that my friends love and say taste like a brownie.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe! So easy! Worth the long refrigeration process. I halved the recipe and got 20 cookies. Like the video says it's a decadent brownie in cookie form!

This recipe is wonderful. I made it more intense by adding some dark cocoa power. I also directly rolled the chilled dough into the sugar, and put it on greased parchment with powdered hands. I noticed it is very easy to under cook these, so I recommend breaking one apart while its in the oven just to see how far they are in the baking process. Overall, great recipe! I will definitely take this to share with fellow students.

These cookies are incredible! The are especially good on top of a cup of vanilla ice cream, and they look beautiful as well! I would recommend this to anyone who wants to make delicious cookies. Also great for bringing to parties. They are best served warm. :)

This recipe is good, easy to make and very pretty but its almost TOO intense of a chocolate taste for my preference. Which is saying alot coming from a chocoholic - if you like dark chocolate these cookies are for you - for myself? I'm more of a milk chocolate fan.

These were moist and delicious. I put the dough in the freezer for about 45 minutes.  They baked up high and puffy.  I will definitely add these to my Christmas tray. Most likely I'll be making them several times before then.

These were much easier than I was thinking after reading some reviews. I used this recipe for cookies boxes we passed out and they were delicious. I substituted 1/2 the vanilla for peppermint based on some reviews and it was perfect.

This is my bf's favorite cookie and he was craving it really bad while overseas. Luckily the weather was pretty cool and the travel time was only 2 weeks so I took the chance of shipping it off to him. I have never tried or made a crinkle before so had no idea what it was supposed to taste like (aside from being chocolate-y). I only made half the amount and got almost the full 3 dozen out of it. However they were tiny and very round (puffy)- not flat like in all of the pictures. The directions didn't say if I should flatten it after rolling it into a ball. Still, maybe that's just common knowledge and I missed it. But it still tasted great. I might even like it better this way because it has a very moist center. My bf claimed they were delicious and ruined his diet. Best compliment ever!

We just made these because we were out of butter and looking for a chocolate recipe that didn't require butter.  They were very good - good texture and very chocolately.  I did add some semi-sweet chips that I had melted to add chocolate flavor.  Delicious!

Every year I try to make these, with various other versions of this recipe and the cookies always turn out flat. Not this year! They were perfect - chocolately, moist inside with a slight crunch on the outside and had a nice presentation.

So easy and so fun! To make it festive, I roll the cookie dough balls (prior to coating with powdered sugar) in 1/2 cup of crushed peppermint. They're delicious with 1/2 a bag of Andies mints added to the mix.

I really enjoyed making these for Christmas.  It is the first time I've had anything like these.  
I only had a minor comment.  I made one batch with almond flavoring instead of vanilla.  And another with orange flavoring.  And they were hits too.

Made these cookies as one of my holiday batch. It's truly a great cookie and very easy to make. The cookie is a little crunchy on the outside and gooey on the inside, it is not too sweet, but again tastes great.

Loved it but found the dough to be a tad wet. I added another 1/4 to 1/2 cup of flour. They also work well rolled in granulated sugar as well.

Fantastic recipe. I used parchment paper of which I sprayed with Pam Butter Spray which eliminated any problems with them sticking! As others wrote..keeping dough in the freezer for 30 minute did the trick.(We are all pressed for time so I skipped refrigeration. They went right to the freezer. Only take out chunks at a time to work with and make sure your hands have water on them and the cookies will be super easy to work with!Also ..use the 2nd to top baking rack as someone else posted. PERFECT RECIPE!!!!!!!!

I didn't have any difficulty working with the dough, following directions exactly.  I prepared the batter in the morning and refrigerated until afternoon, and it was easy to work with.  The cookies are rich and fudgy.  I brought them to a Christmas potluck at work and they were all gone in very short order, and I was asked at least once for the recipe.  The only thing I would say is that they don't make 6 dozen, mine turned out closer to 4 dozen.  But they are delicious, and I will be making again!

Absolutely flawless. Rich, fudgey goodness.  I add a pinch more salt for that extra sweet/salty after taste, but these are just wonderful. Super easy too.  I practically have the recipe memorized after only making twice.  Mmmmm!

Made exact. They were a favorite this year ( I make cookie platters for local police dept, schools, daycare etc). The batter was still a little sticky to roll out after 4 hr refrigerate but I just put conf. Sugar on my hands which was an easy fix. My best taste description would be chocolate cake, brownie cookies. Soft in middle, crispy outside. Great! Will be making again very soon!

Made this for the first time as the cookie for our cookie swap at work.  Made it exactly as the recipe states except followed other members with freezing for 30 - 45 minutes instead of putting the dough in refrigerator.  As I made the cookies I put the dough back in the freezer to keep it kind of stiff.  This made it easier to work with.  I also took the advice of the second shelf down from the top of the oven and baked exactly 10 minutes.  Came out perfect. I do want to try the peppermint extract next time.

This is a very easy and versatile recipe.  I can't quite understand why so many reviewers had trouble with the texture of the dough--as long as it's cold, it's not hard to work at all. (Try the freezer if it's still too messy to form into nice balls.)  
I changed the recipe a bit by adding two teaspoons of coffee flavoring and one of vanilla, and it turned out great----and even better after a day or two.  Next time, I'm going to add peppermint flavoring and put Hershey's peppermint kisses on it for a holiday party. I'll be keeping this one!

I have been making this recipe for years. I like that it uses cocoa powder instead of melted chocolate like my mom used to use. I only use 1 tsp vanilla and add 2 tsp mint extract and about 5 crushed up full sized candy canes. Thanks for the great recipe and memories.

Okay, so I was very intimidated by these at first, very nervous about how they would come out, but they were easy and delicious! I took some to the family for Thanksgiving, and they requested I bring more for Christmas.

Substituted half the vanilla extract for peppermint. Mine turned out really thin, maybe the dough wasn't cold enough?

A showy cookie that is rich and moist with a little crispy coating. Delightful.  Would be good in variations too.  Nuts would be good, mint would be good, almond would be good, cinnamon and chili might be great.  I am adding this recipe to my Christmas collection.  Thanks!

YUM- these are rich, chocolaty and delightful!  I refrigerated them overnight which helped with the sticky dough.  Also, as other reviewers suggested I transferred the dough straight from the cookie dough scoop to the powder sugar.  Handling it less helped with the stickiness as well.  Thanks for this keeper recipe!

I made these exactly as directed. I used Hershey's brand cocoa powder. I used a tiny ice cream scoop, to make smaller cookies. Once they baked, cooled, and set, they were about 1.5" in diameter. 350 for 10 minutes was perfect for the small cookies. I also made a batch with a 1.5 tablespoon scoop, and those were best baked at 350 for 12 minutes. Since these are super rich, I think I will stick with the smaller size.

Really good- chilled the dough for about 24 hours, turned out delicious! Once they cooled, I put them in an airtight container to store for 1 day. They taste great fresh out of the oven and cooled as well. It was a real crowd-pleaser!

Very good and easy to make!  I chilled the dough in the frig for close to 5 hours and didn't have too much trouble with sticky dough.  I would fill one cookie sheet and then put the rest of the dough back in the frig while the one pan baked.  I added one teaspoon of peppermint extract, as per other reviews and I am glad I did.  It was just a hint of peppermint, not too over powering.  I plan on making this recipe again and again.

The best crinkle cookie.  I had tried a different recipe on All Recipes that would puddle every time I tried to make them.  The dough is almost stiff enough without refrigeration, but they always bake perfectly.

Amazing!!  Followed the recipe exactly except instead of chilling for 4 hours I put them in the freezer for about 45 min.  Still a bit sticky but workable.
I also found that by the time I was done rolling the last cookies in the powdered sugar the first cookies looked as if the powdered sugar had "melted" into them.  I just re rolled any that looked like that and they came out just like the others.

I added 3/4 tsp. mint extract and chocolate chips (little or a lot!). I also split the cocoa powder, half the regular unsweetened and half the special dark. Be generous with the powdered sugar to get a good "crinkle". These few changes takes a already great cookie to a whole new level!

Fantastic!  I had never made this type of cookie before and they came out perfect.  I added 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp almond to mine just to intensify the flavor.  They were amazing.

These are edible. I was looking for a fudgy brownie-like cookie, with a great chocolate flavor -- how it was described. I followed the recipe EXACTLY and they came out very cake-like and flavorless. My mom likes them, which is the only reason they get more than one star. Plus the batter was so hard to work with, even after freezing. Not worth the effort.

I thought these were just ok.  But at the same time, I really don't know how crinkles are supposed to taste.  It taste like a light version of brownies.  My husband and daughter liked them though.

Absolutely terrific. I bake just as called for in the recipe, and make no changes. Make sure you use the parchment paper!! Even with no-stick cookie sheets, you really really need the parchment paper. This is my roommate Lisa's favorite cookie, and I've made many times!

Because of the snow day my son and I decided to bake and he wanted cookies so we tried this crinkle cookie recipe and it rocks! They just came out of the oven and look great. I followed the recipe exactly as written. My son loves them so much he just finished saying "man these cookies are good"! (and he is not a cookie fan). I have to stop him from eating his 4th cookie! I will obviously be making these again and again.

Made just like instructions said. We did divide the dough into 3 portions for easier handling. Made one portion with mint choc chips, which was great, one portion with regular choc chips, which was ok, & the last portion as is, which was just like a brownie. These were very hard to combine all the ingredients my husband said because it is very stiff. They are very good & you don't want them bigger than the one inch ball when rolling.

Very yummy! Not heavy, but chocolately and delicious. I made them with 6oz semisweet chocolate, 1/4 cup oil, and 1c sugar, because I didn't have any cocoa.

I've made other chocolate crinkle/crackle recipes, but this is by far the best. I was skeptical about the use of oil over butter because I've really only made butter cookies. But these cookies got rave reviews and stay moist for days. I'll be making these a lot. They'd be great with some mint extract or mint chips, as well.

mine tasted like really fudgy brownies but looked like cookies, they were delicious! I added a cup of semisweet chips, and I added cherries on the tops of some of them after they came out of the oven. I also put in the freezer for 40 minutes and then just drops gobs directly into sugar and then formed the balls.

Made these last night and they turned out perfect!  I didn't have the parchment paper so I just sprayed a little vegetable oil spray on the baking sheet and it was fine, not one of them stuck.  I did take the others' advice and put the dough in the freezer for about 45 minutes before I started baking them.  The dough was pretty sticky when it wasn't cold but if I had froze it longer, I wouldn't have had that problem.  Happy baking!  They're definitely worth the effort

My family has been making this cookie for years. I decided to try a new variation and chose this recipe - best idea ever. Even a few days later, the cookies are still most and delicious. Definitely a keeper.

This recipe was so easy to make! I did use vegetable shortening instead of vegetable oil but they were still AMAZING! And I put the batter in the freezer for an hour like other reviewers. 
The only thing I would do differently is make the cookies smaller. They are wayyyyyyyy too dense to eat a whole big cookie(I used a large ice cream scoop... I wanted huge cookies). 1 inch diameter cookies are more practical for this recipe.

Everyone loved these!  Once the dough was chilled, I used my cookie scoop to drop the dough, 3 at a time, into a small bowl filled with 1.5 cups powdered sugar.  I just swished the bowl back and forth to coat them, didn't shake off too much excess, and put them on a parchment-lined baking sheet.  Easy, no mess, and 10 minutes later, we had delicious fudgy cookies.  I made these with my chocolate-loving son in mind, so I added 1/3 cup mini chocolate chips.  Great with a glass of milk :).

This is a really great dairy-free recipe. I added 2 tsp of cinnamon and a very small pinch of cayenne to make these taste like a Mexican chocolate cookie.

These are absolutely delicious and super easy to make.  Once I had all of the dough ingredients mixed together, I put it in the freezer to make it easier to form the balls.  Their consistency is close to a brownie, which my family loved.  These did not last long!

This is quite the chocolate fix. I used 2 teasp of mccormicks pure coffee extract instead of vanilla and will stick with that change. I froze the batter for one hour and it was good to go. Next time I will flatten the cookies a bit since I like them thinner than these turned out.

These are a favorite in our household as well as the office! For those that complained that the cookies were plain or tasteless, that would depend on the quality of cocoa that you used. When I used some cheap dutch processed cocoa we were not impressed, but when i made these using Hershey's unsweetened cocoa - WOW. It was like eating chocolate lava bites. These are even better the next day, the first day it's normally a bit too fudgy.

Made these today and they were divine! :) A few things I discovered while making crinkles:

1. Make sure you roll the dough into balls quickly because at room temperature it absorbs the refined sugar so it won't be as white as snow and perfect. Also, it's messier because it will stick to your hand or to the spoon when you make the balls.

2. I agree that to get it to crack, place it on the top most shelf of your oven. Makes it crinkle perfectly.

I don't know if it's the temperature of the dough but my first batch were rounder than the second ones because the dough was still cold when I rolled them.

These turned out geat! My first attempt at crinkle cookies, and they crinkled perfectly! I susbstitued a couple of teaspoons of amaretto syrup (for coffees) in place of the vanilla extract - gave a very subtle extra flavor. They taste like the powder sugared brownies at Cici's pizza - only better. Good with a tall glass of cold milk - really rich and chocolatey.

WOW. These taste even more delicious than they look. They are like little bites of brownie, with all that moist brownie chocolaty goodness, but even better. I baked them on the top rack like one of the reviews suggested and the crinkle effect turned out perfect. I will be making plates of these to take to parties and give away during the holidays. YUM!

This recipe has become one of my standards. I double it, then put half the dough in the freezer - its so nice to have if I need a quick dessert to bring somewhere later. Definitely use a scoop to put the dough into the powdered sugar - saves time and prevents some of the mess. I've also learned to make the powdered sugar covered balls ahead of time to store in the fridge for a day or two, then throw onto the cookie sheet to bake when needed.

These are full of childhood memories and present-day fun!  My little boys each had a container of powdered sugar and they took turns rolling the cookies. My little guy said the cookies might as well have their fun now, since they'd soon be eaten!   I confess, I always add about 1/4 cup extra flour because I don't like flat cookies.  Glad I did, as they turned out perfect.  So glad I used this recipe!

I have a new favorite cookie.  Warm from the oven, these are dangerously good.
Recommend splitting dough into 2 bowls and rotate one back into refrigerator as you are filling a baking sheet from the other.

these are super easy to make, and they are rather tasty too! i suggest chilling them in the fridge for a few hours so they aren't so sticky when you roll them into balls and dip them in the powdered sugar. i will def be making these again!

This recipe is perfect. It is so great. The texture is browny like. I have made this recipe many times and they always come out great. Be sure not to over coat or undercoat. Even coating will give you a homogenous crinkle effect.

Added chocolate chips to the batter, otherwise followed recipe (although only placed in freezer for ~15 minutes prior to rolling in powdered sugar). Amazing cookies. Will make again soon.

Oh my gosh theses cookies are AMAZING! I was leary to try the recipe because of some other reviews, but I did and they turned out great! I follwed the recipe to the tee. I did wet my fingers to help rool the balls. I also used a 1/2 tbsp to make the balls. Between each set of cookies, I placed the dough back in the fridge to keep cool. They are a hit in my house. One of my favorite cookies.

I used country-market farm fresh large eggs.  I used Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa.  
The recipe as shown made 8 dozen (not 6 dozen).  A 1 inch ball is really rather small.  My melon scoop was too large.  The balls spread out to about 2 inches.  No need to press them to help them spread out.
The dough is very soft.  It reminded me of soft-ball stage candy.  I wouldn't make this with young children helping.  It takes a long time to form the balls and prep for the oven.  I spent about 3 hours setting up trays and baking. I used cooking spray on my spoon and my fingers when I formed the individual cookies.   
Roll each cookie in ordinary white sugar and then roll in XXX sugar.  If you don't, the oil in the cookie will absorb the XXX sugar and it will disappear.  The white sugar keeps the XXX sugar on the surface.
These were beautiful and tasted much like brownie edges--crispy and soft at the same time.  
For Christmas I would add pepperment extract.

These are my absolute favorite cookie.  Very much like a brownie...but not.  I refridgerate the dough till firm, then I roll the balls.  I freeze the balls before I roll in sugar and bake.  DELISH!

My family loves this recipe.  It was easy and I found that we had most of the ingredients at home.  However I did tweak it a bit.  I did a half a cup of unsweetened cocoa powder mixed with a half a cup of special dark cocoa powder.  It doesn't change the calorie count or the fat count, but it does the sodium a little bit.  I also didn't wait for the cookie batter to cool for four hours and they still turned out ok so if you are turned off by the time just skip that step.  

Again, LOVE THEM!

Super yummy!  I added a little bit more cocoa to make it more chocolatey, but decided that next time I wouldn't.  As much as I love chocolate, it was a bit too dark for even me.  Otherwise very tasty!

I tried this recipe twice in one week. The first time was a test run before a fancy dinner I was cooking. The cookies were good but just ordinary chocolate cookies. The second time I made the batter thicker ( a lot thicker) and they turned out perfect! very rich and chocolatey goodness. I only made one change- I subbed about a qaurter of the all porpose flour for all purpose chocolate flavoured flour. So, I'd advise anyone who this recipe didn't work for once to revaluate what went wrong and try again becuase they are an easy effort with a great outcome!

Great recipe - one thing it didn't say (although it's obvious in hindsight lol) is that you need to press your thumb or 2 fingers slightly down into the ball once it's placed on the cookie sheet.  And rubbing the cookie sheed with vegetable oil worked pretty well!

followed this recipe and had amazing results! added mint extract and took another reviewers advice to bake them on the second highest rack in the oven. also, I only froze my dough for about fifteen minutes, and while it was a little messy it got the job done! great recipe overall, will def use this again!

These were excellent.  Nice and moist inside, slightly crispy outside.  Next time I will try to add a bit of chocolate and maybe cook them only 10 minutes.  Very easy to make, with great results.

This recipe is dangerous.  It is simple to make and makes quite a large batch of cookies.  Which is why it is so dangerous.  They are like little mini brownies/chocolate cake.  My boyfriend and I LOVED these.  I'll definitely make these again (although I'll give half away for my own good).

Never made crinkles before but this was a very easy recipe and very yummy especially with some vanilla ice cream with it.  One thing that I would do to make it easier to shape is to  break it into three parts after mixing and place it in the freezer as other reviews stated and bring it out one at a time and shape as it can get gooey fast.

I love these! They are a great little cookie that isn't overly sweet. They make for a wonderful "everyday" sort of treat. My one complaint is that you would have to make them really really small to achieve the 40something calories that they list. Mine were pretty small and still worked out to be about 75, but that is still pretty good for a chocolate cookie :)

The kids & I made these at least four times together over the holidays.  A great recipe to use when you have "helpers," I put the powdered sugar in a freezer sized bag and sealed it up so they could take turns shaking it to coat the cookies. Wonderfully chocolatey, sofy on the inside with a nice crisp outside. Thank you for sharing!

this is a great cookie. I did however cut the sugar way way down. I used about 1/2 a cup. They are rolled in sugar they don't need so much. I also rolled mine in white sugar and powdered sugar.

These cookies are great.  I made the first batch and then tried one, they were soft in the middle of the cookie, like a brownie.  My husband couldn't stop eating them.  I made them again at Christmas and they were the first cookies to be eaten.  I will save this recipe as one of my favourites.

Super yummy and great just as written!  I got busy and they sat in a sealed container overnight in the fridge prior to baking and were fine.  Be sure to store in a sealed container or they get crunchy...but then they are awesome for dipping in milk or coffee!

Made exactly 6 dozen.....what I needed for a cookie exchange at work.....did add some mini semi sweet chocolate chips. Pretty cookie and yummy! I made the dough the night before and had great results scooping and baking these. Not flat at all and beautifully crackled. Thanks!

This recipe is awesome!...Easy. I didn't change a thing. The only thing I didn't do was use parchment paper. I used Pam butter flavored spray. Great cookies. Will make again.

I made these for my holiday goodie bags this Christmas, they were absolutely divine! The only change I made was instead of using 2tsp of vanilla I used 1tsp vanilla & 1tsp pure mint extract. They were like soft thin mints! Everybody [including myself] loved them! I've made alot of cookies in my day & these are definitely in the running for best yet! I'll definitely be making these again, and SOON! lol. :)

I have never been into baking or cooking just cook enough to feed my family. I had a Christmas party at work and needed to bring a desert that was "presentable". So when I found this recipe I gave it a try. I did a prcatice run a week before the party and it was a huge hit. My husband and little girl loved them and so did everyone at work. I ended up having to make 4 batches within two weeks and people are still asking for them. So happy to have found this recipe and I really believe it has given me a new found "baking confidence"

Came out great. I only chilled for about 40 minutes because I was impatient, but I had no trouble with sticking. I made a few with crushed candy cane on the outside, but the crinkles came out a little weird and flaky on those.

Excellent cookie. Imperative that you take out as soon as starts to crack or you do not get a fudgy interior. Made the cookie exactly as recipe indicated. Barely got 5 dozen with a 100 measure scoop. Gave it a 4 because it isn't an in your face fabulous cookie, but rather very good and looks great on a cookie tray.

Easy to make Fudgy and just the perfect fix for that chocolate moment. Followed the reipe to the T.  I made the dough the night before  stuck it into a Tupperware bowl and refrigerator overnight. The dough was easy to work with, no need to wet fingers or sugar them up.. rolled them and than rerolled them in powdered sugar. They crinkled up beautifully.

Really delicious. I followed the recipe exactly, put my cookies on the second to top rack and they cracked and crinkled perfectly. they are great, they are fudgy, tasty. i will make these again and again. next time, i'd go with either toasted nuts or granulated sugar instead of the powdered sugar. thank you!

No one really cared for these, sorry.  Followed exactly but they fell flat after coming out of the oven.  The took longer to bake also, obviously not done the first time I took them out.  Very weird texture, like grainy chocolate.

These a awsome........ Make sure t mix the dry stuff as the recipie states, go with the larger size and do not let sit more the 4 hours before baking. If you use smaller and let sit longer than 4 hours they tend to be hard. If you follow the recipie and make larger cookies ( I used same scopp I use from small meat balls) than these are soft my whole family loves them (Thank you to whoever posted these)

Very easy and delicious!  I used canola oil and added chocolate chips.  I didn't have time to chill for 4 hours so I put the batter in the freezer for 2 hours instead.  The consistency was perfect to roll and not too gooey.  I rolled the balls in a bowl of powdered sugar which made it very easy to coat.  Baked for 11 minutes and used parchment paper.  Turned out great!

Tastes like a fudge brownie, only in cookie form.  I chilled the dough over-night, scooped out a portion with a teaspoon, rolled it into a ball, then dropped it into the powdered sugar.  I used parchment paper on my cookie sheet.  I had no problem with the dough being too sticky, and they came right up off the parchment paper when done.

Very Christmas-y looking but the taste was nothing special. Three stars for the looks on a plate!

My kids and I wanted to make these more 'Christmas-y' so we added crushed candy canes to the powdered sugar and they turned out great!

These were good, but I feel like something is missing. I followed the recipe exactly..I only got 3 1/2 dozens instead of 6, which is okay with me. I thought that the 2 cups of sugar was going to be too sweet, but it's not sweet at all. Plus, I don't think there's enough chocolate taste to it. The cookies came out perfect (baked for 10 mins). Maybe next time, I'll add some more sugar or some chocolate chips to it.

I halved this recipe and I made about 31 cookies. I rolled them into balls and they didn't spread very much when I baked them. They reminded me of a brownie cookie- moist, dense, and good chocolate flavor. Best of all, they are low in calories and fat.

I made this today and they were amazing! I halved the recipe because I didn't have enough flour, didn't add any vanilla extract because I had none, and added 2/3 cup of chocolate chips and they were SO good :D I think I ended up baking them for about 15-16 minutes because they were SO soft, but I still took them out when they were very soft and they cooled to be crunchy on the outside and super chewy on the inside. Will definitely make these again! :)

I could tell from all the photos they consistently look good. Made them for my book club (nice change from the usual butter cookies). Easy to make, looked great, tasted great = 5 stars. Day 2: Just noticed they got hard....  :(

I make this at Christmas time-for the past two years.  I do half the dough rolled in powdered sugar and the other in granulated and kisses on top as per another reviewer.  It works perfectly-and nobody ever notices until I say!

Ooey, gooey goodness.  I made 1/2 a batch, but only ended up with 26 cookies, so I wish I had made a full batch, especially because these are for a party for tonight.  Now I won't get to keep a reserve at home for a late night snack.  These are like a powdered sugar covered soft brownie.  The dough was sticky, even after 4 hours of chilling, so I just dropped it from my cookie scoop right into the sugar, which made it a lot easier to work with.  Baked the on a Silpat sheet, so there was no sticking and easy clean-up.  Will probably make these instead of brownies because they turned out so fabulous!

Very good cookie.  The flavor gets a bit bland for me after a while (but I'm like that because I like texture changes ie. nuts etc...in my cookies), so I made a few changes...that are not for the light eaters...I used 1 stick (1/2) cup of melted butter instead of vegetable oil.  I also put semi-sweet chocolate chips in it, for some surprise in the bite.  It is so chocolaty that you may not be able to handle it, but I am a fan.

This was a wonderful treat! The past reviews were helpful. I froze the dough for 45 min then in the refrigerator for a little over an hour and the dough was not too sticky to handle.  Very moist, only needed to be in the over 9.5 min. I will certainly make these again!

Good, moist, very chocolaty and chewy but didn't have the wow factor. I'd make again but it probably wouldn't be my go to cookie recipe.

Not the best cookie but when you are craving chocolate and don't want to eat a ton of calories or fat this is a good choice. Very pretty too.

Really delicious "low cal" cookies.  Watch them so that they don't bake too long!  Unfortunately these do not keep as long as other traditional holiday butter cookies--which means that you don't save them but eat them right away.

What a fun and different cookie?! I've never had these before. They are delicate and crispy on the outside and have a chewy-fudgy center. Using an average sized cookie scoop, I got 42 cookies.

These cookies are easy and have a great consistency. But, I think they are a little lacking in flavor. Next time I will try adding more cocoa powder, or perhaps add chocolate or peanutbutter chips.

Fantastic-- especially right out of the over. I used dark chocolate instead and they came out nearly black. The flavor was rich, and the cookie perfectly moist.

I've made these cookies several times since discovering the recipe with rave reviews.  I was looking for a crinkle recipe that didn't involve melting chocolate.  I am so glad that I found this one.

My family really loved this cookie.  I did add 1/2 c bittersweet chocolate to intensify the chocolate taste and that worked out well.  After making the first tray and seeing that they really didn't spread as much as I thought they would, I took a glass with a flat bottom and pushed them down on the other trays.  Big mistake!  We called those the ugly cookies.  At that point, it was too late to fix them.  The only other thing was for me, these dried out too quickly.  I like a moister cookie and after a few days, I just didn't like them as much.  Still a hit with everyone though!

The cookies looked great, but tasted like there was too much baking powder I think. I used a small ice cream scoop to get a uniform sized ball, then dropped it into the confectioner's sugar to coat. They looked really neat and the kids loved them. Great cookie

This is the second time I have made these and they are a hit... normally I don't like to use vegetable oil because it makes cookies too greasy but it seems to be fine in this recipe. It could be because since I am at altitude, I added about 1/2 c more flour for a chewy cookie. I also made them this time with drinking chocolate with sugar included since I was low on cocoa powder and it turned out great, simply a little sweeter. i think this could be done with any cocoa mix as long as the sugar was adjusted accordingly. They end up moist and keep well for at least a week (if they last that long). Chilling the dough for at least 30 min in the fridge is a big help and makes it much easier to roll into balls. I also use the other reviewer's tip about cooking on the top rack, they crackle beautifully. Thanks!

These are excellent.  I made these 1/17/2010 for a little get together with friends and everyone loved them.   They taste like brownies, and I will make these again in the future.   Easy recipe.

These were great!  i just knew I would never be able to make anything as pretty as the picture but I did!  Mine turned out just like they were supposed to.  It was a little messy making them but so worth it.  They had a great brownie like flavor that my family loved.  The recipe made a lot.  Fortunately they kept well in a large resealable plastic bag.  We ate them all through Christmas. (and they stayed pretty!)

These are good, but could use chocolate chips or some kind of flavored chip to to make them even better.Next time I make these I will also try using coffee liqueur in place of vanilla. I also sprayed the pan with cooking spray instead of using parchment paper and had no problem with sticking.

Turned out great! Thanks for sharing! Also thanks for the tips! I added cayenne pepper as someone suggested to get creative! You may need to add only a pinch of it in the middle as you roll the chocolate dough into a ball. It'll put a kick to it to your cookie ;)

Excellent.  I added about 1 1/2 tsp of instant coffee crystals to the sugar mixture and let it dissolve a bit before adding the dry ingredients, (thats just something I often do to chocolatey goodies being a coffee-a-holic.)   Also I left this in the refrigerator overnight because I have found that cookies always taste better if you let the batter rest a bit.    These were excellent cookies, aside from those small changes I made for our taste, I followed the recipe exactly.  Beautiful cookies too!

These are great cookies!   The dough was very sticky, even after chilling for a couple days, so I simply dropped a spoonful of dough in a bowl of confectioners sugar, rolled it around in the sugar and THEN rolled it into a ball.  Worked great, and my hands weren't covered in sticky dough.  I also added 1 cup of mini-chips into the dough, the only change I made.  I will definitely make these again!

These cookies are delicious.  I made them exactly as the recipe calls for and wouldnt change a thing.  They looked just like the picture and tasted fab.  We didn't have a single one left over.

The only thing different that I did was to use canola oil!  I baked them for 10 minutes and they were amazing.  The only problem is I can't stop eating them!!!

These were great! I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfectly, though I did have to cook them for about 15 or so minutes cause they didn't look done. But they tasted like a brownie soft and moist. Once I mentioned the word brownie they were gone in minutes from my holiday tray!

This was an easy recipe.  I have always enjoyed Chocolate Crinkles but hadn't made any in many years.  This recipe did not disappoint.  I took them to a carry-in dinner at church, and I had people thanking me for bringing them.

A couple of notes on this one after reading the reviews:  I am impatient, so I only chilled the dough for maybe 20-30 minutes, and didn't have problems rolling it.  It was a little sticky, but not impossible.  Also, as far as the cookies sticking to the sheet, I just left them to cool on the sheet, and they popped off with a little push on each of them, so no issue there, either, and no waste of parchment.  I thought these were a really good chewy/ brownie like cookie.  Next time, I'll may add some chocolate chips for a little more depth or take some of the other reviewers' advice and add mint, probably crushed candy cane since i don't keep mint extract on hand, then finely crush some candy cane and mix it with the powdered sugar before rolling.  I bet those would be great for Christmas!

Added these to my cookies trays this year after all the wonderful recommendations over on the recipe exchange board.  Kept dough in fridge over night and it was indeed sticky to work with but I coated my hands in powdered sugar and that worked wonders.  Have to admit after all that I was worried how well they would go over but they went over GREAT!  Hubby is not a big sweet eater but even he was raving over these.  He took a plate of them to work and everyone agreed they were a hit.  Will make again. Thanks for the recipe!  Edit:  Made this again for 2010 Christmas and found some great advice from another reviewer:  MS said to coat the balls in regular sugar to help the powdered sugar stick---worked like a charm!!!

Wow. I think this is the best cookie recipe I've come across at All recipes. VERY impressed. If you are a chocolate lover its' perfect as is, but I recommend adding a teaspoon of cinnamon. Gorgeous cookies.

Very good!  I froze the dough for about 45 minutes (as suggested in the reviews) and I didn't have any problems with it sticking.  They crinkled beautifully.  I will use more chocolate or some mint extract the next time that I make them, because they aren't quite as flavorful as I'd like.  Other than that, they're great!

Fabulous cookies - I have baked every year for 20, but with a BIG difference - substitute MINT EXTRACT for vanilla....and you have mint dreams. I also use melted chocolate chips instead of unsweetened cocoa.

Cookie texture is great; with crinkles and everything. Dough is sticky but the effort is worth it. Too sweet for my taste and not chocolatey enough. Next time I will cut sugar in 1/2 and add a handful of dark chocolate chips and additional cocoa and a bit of instant coffee. Can't wait to try again.

This is a great recipe for these cookies! I love the slightly domed cookies like these rather than the same type that spread on the sheet during cooking. These stay moist and delicious for days.  Thank you for another recipe in my box!

These are some tasty chocolate cookies! They are by far my favorite chocolate cookies yet. And they look pretty with the cracked powdered sugar. The dough is really hard to work with, though. I think they are worth the hassle, but definitely keep your hands moist or floured. And freeze the dough.

Good cookie - however, I can't help feel like it's missing something? The kids and I used powdered sugar to coat our hands with as we rolled the cookies - definitely helped with the stickiness. Also - I definitely did NOT get close to 72 cookies and I made a batch and a half! More like 45 cookies - and I was using 1 inch balls.

These were good, but not the best. It seemed a bit dry afterwards to me. It was great right when it came out though! It was horrific when forming the dogh into balls to coat in sugar. They were so sticky! I tried putting water on my hands to avoid stickiness, but it still stuck. I found it easier to just scoop some dough and toss it in a bowl of powdered sugar and move it around in there so it will be covered in powdered sugar. :P

Like little nuggets of fudgy chocolate cake - yum!  I forgot to grease the pan the first time round and it didn't really make a difference - no problem getting then off the pan.

I have been using this site for a few years, but I've never commented or rated a recipe until now. These cookies were absolutely delicious. I made them for a holiday party and they were the biggest hit. I made the batter exactly as the recipe states and, at the suggestion of other, froze the batter for 45 minutes. I used a samll scooper to scoop the dough and drop it directly into the confectioners sugar. It is a waste of time to try to handle the dough with your fingers. I I suggest HEAVILY coating the cookies with the confectioners sugar before placing them on a greased cookie sheet. Yes, you MUST grease it. I cooked 1 sheet at a time on the top rack of the oven to get them to look crinkled and they did. I will most definitely be making these little bites of heavenly chocolate brownie-like gems again. You will NOT be disappointed.

Very quick and easy!  Taste just like one-bite brownies! Skip the refrigeration and just put the dough into the freezer for 30 mins before shaping cookies.  I followed others advice and baked near the top (2nd rack from top of oven).  Enjoy!

So good, so simple!  I followed the recipe as posted with the addition of ½ teaspoon espresso powder.  The texture is amazing, crisp on the edges; soft and chewy in the center.  I’ll make these again and again.

not a big fan :( sorry. Alot of work went into these and i just wasn't impressed with the result. Everyone else liked them though. I found them to be a little dry, they didnt keep well (even with the old bread in the container trick) and I wasnt a huge fan of the flavor. I am going to try changing this recipe a bit and trying again. I think an addition of semi sweet chocolate chips might help. I'll let you know how that goes

This is a favorite of one of my coworkers so I thought I'd give them a whirl. I have NEVER made any kind of chocolate crinkle before, but I am so glad I did. My family loved them. They are soft, chewy, chocolately, and delicious. I also used about half the recipe to make chocolate blossom cookies. I rolled the balls in granulated sugar and then pressed a Hershey's Candy Cane Kisses into them right after they came out of the oven. Yum! I'll be making the Kisses version for Santa this year per my daughter's request.

My son says these taste just like brownies so if you don't need a cookie just make brownies.  If you really want a cookie then these are good.  When you are rolling the dough into little balls, divide the dough into quarters and only use 1 quarter at a time.  Keep the rest of the dough in the refrigerator until you need it because the colder it is, the easier it is to work with.

very fudgey! They were a big hit with the preschoolers at my house!! Easy!! Two things that I got from previous reviews that I used and helped me tremendously: Put the dough in the freezer for a little while instead of the refrigerator-so much faster! AND use wet hands to handle the dough. Thanks so much for the recipe!

These are fabulous!  I mixed them yesterday and baked two trays worth.  The dough stayed great overnight and I was ale to bake the rest this AM with no problem.  The dough is sticky, but if you have a cookie scoop it was no problem.  I just dropped the scoop directly into the sugar and didn't use my hands until the sugar was on the dough.  I coated really well with powdered sugar and baked on the 2nd to top rack in the oven.  They cracked beautifully and the taste is wonderful!  A keeper for sure!

I accidentally bought sweetened cocoa powder, but used it anyway and they turned out great!  They are like a brownie consistency, but in a cookie and look so pretty. I'm definitely adding these to my Christmas cookie tray.

These cookies are festive looking and taste like a brownie. The only change I made was to add a square of melted bittersweet chocolate to the batter. I did what the other reviewers mentioned and put the batter in the freezer for 45 minutes so they were easy to handle and baked them on the second shelf of the oven one tray at a time so they would have a nice crackle on top. Unfortuneatly doing these steps made this recipe a little time consuming to make. I gave this recipe three stars because I felt it would be easier to make brownies in tiny muffin pans and douse them with powdered sugar.

Great cookies! I should have halved the recipe because I didn't realize it made so many cookies before I had already got started - but with this recipe, the more the better! They're really great minutes after they come out of the oven!

I was looking for a new cookie recipe when I came across this one. I divided this recipe in half just to give it a try. Wow -are these tasty! Not too sweet and nice and chewy. I used a silpat instead of parchment paper and had a very slight sticking issue. As others noted, I used the rack second from the top and the outcome was picture-perfect.   I will definitely make this recipe again! Thank You for sharing.  **Note: I baked batch #2 on the Silpat for 11 minutes and there was NO sticking issue**

I made these for a cookie exchange.  They were pretty good.  They had a subtle flavor and they weren't terribly sweet.  The only adjustment I made was to add a teaspoon of instant espresso with the vanilla.  I always do this in chocolate recipes as I find it enhances the chocolate flavor.  They were well received.

These are great, if not a bit sweet for my liking. I cut down the sugar by 100 grams although I would cut it down next time by 150g instead. I put the dough in the freezer for 1 hour and rolled them into balls using wet hands. I clean my hands every second or third cookie and to coat them I got a round bottomed rice bowl of 11cm diameter and put in the icing sugar. Then I put in the ball and quickly swirled the bowl. The cookie quickly becomes coated evenly and rounded very well. No mess at all. Remember to dig up the icing sugar after each cookie as it can form a compacted shell.

I keep thinking that I must have done something terribly wrong. My dough is still like thick brownie batter even after chilling overnight. I thought I had maybe not added enough flour but my tester cookie turned out about right. The only problem was that I had as much dough stuck to my hand as went into the cookie. I'm salvaging by baking it up in greased mini muffin tins. The flavor is great, I'll definately try this recipie again just to see if I'm as terrible at baking as I now seem to be.

So delicious and chocolatey!  Describing these as brownie cookies is very accurate (and what could POSSIBLY be wrong with that combo?!).  They are also so pretty; a beautiful winter cookie.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe and I baked them for about 11 minutes in my electric oven.  I will make more of these this month for sure!

these cookies are amazing! i made them for a group of my girl friends coming over and they couldn't stop eating them...and told me that they are the best cookies they have ever eaten and begged for the recipe. i took the advice of wetting my hands before making the balls, which was extremely helpful. otherwise the recipe was absolutely perfect! thanks!! this is definitely going to be a christmas tradition :)

These are awesome!  So fancy looking, but really easy to make.  Just make sure the balls of dough you roll are smaller (I used a melon-baller) and the dough is cold.

Loving them! So soft, crunchy, pretty cookies. Baked in an oven on a second to the top rack to have cracks, as ABBY15 suggested. Will make more next time :) Thanks for sharing the recipe.

These were sooo good!  Just made one change - I added a teaspoon of peppermint extract with the vanilla.  Awesome extra flavor!  I froze the dough for about an hour.  Worked out really well.  Made these for my daughter's class, and I don't want to share them - have to make an extra batch! :)

This was the first time making these cookies and they were absolutely wonderful.  My children are my taste-testers when I try something new and they gave it a big two thumbs up!  My only "complaint" if you can call it that is the recipe was to make 72 and I only got 57, and I didn't make them huge.  Oh well!  This one is definitely a keeper!

This was an AWESOME Chocoloate Crinkles. One recipe is not enough for my whole family. I reduced the sugar into 1 1/2 just like others say and I put in the freezer for 30mins only because I am in a hurry. everything turns well. If you are a chocolate lovers you will definitely love this recipe. I will make more this christmas to give away to my friends. Thanks for sharing!

Simply amazing! Possibly some of the most beautiful cookies I have ever made! Their striking appearance is combined with a rich chocolate flavor and soft texture. AWESOME!! I did substitute 1 stick of melted margarine for the 1/2 cup of oil, but they still turned out great.

As a family we are now addicted to these Crinkles! We are Australian and haven't ever come across anything like this before.  First of all I'd thought to practice them with a view to having them as a Christmas treat....good idea.  Have made them once a week for three weeks now and there is no sign of the requests letting up. Thank you for sharing this amazing treat Ingrid.  Carol.

Turned out great!    I used half whole wheat flour and half regular. I feel like I can taste the oil a little too much. Next time I'll substitute applesauce, and I know they'll be just as delicious!

These were good cookies. Unfortunately, I have no idea what I did wrong in the mixing process because the dough initially came out crumbly. I added in a dash of milk to get that sticky texture then stuck it in the fridge. I had no problem with it after that. Baked up perfectly and was chocolaty but not as fudgy as I would have liked them to be. This is a good recipe for crinkles when you are out of chocolate squares. Thanks for sharing.

Different things that I did were: using 1 tsp. of baking soda, Splenda baking sugar instead of regular sugar in the dough, and had them in the fridge for 24 hours before baking.  They turned out great.  I wasn't expecting them to taste like a brownie, but they did.  The sugar gave them a slight crunch on the outside and they were warm and chewy on the inside.  Delicious!

These cookies were alot of trouble to get onto the pan.I even froze the batter overnight to harden. I should have just made brownies instead, thats what they ended up tasting like. Don't get me wrong, they tasted great, just not worth the hassle.

Not sold on this cookie! I feel like it is lacking something. I think I will try this recipe one more time except try modifying it a bit. I will let you know then again how I feel about this recipe! Hmm...maybe I will just make my own recipe and then share it with you! Yeah! I like that idea!

Very much like brownies!  I don't think there is a need for anymore chocolate--these are extremely rich as is.  The cookie dough is almost like a cake batter, so it's essential to refrigerate or freeze long enough to thicken it.  I made the dough last night and this morning made the cookies.  I used my medium cookie scoop (only bc my small scoop is dirty) and it worked well.  The dough is still pretty sticky, so rolling in sugar really helps.  I just rolled all the balls and then refrigerated until I could place them on my cookie sheets.  I have silpat mats and they still stuck slightly--it's best to let them cool on the cookie sheet for a while.  Thanks for the recipe!

Chewy, moist, like another reviewer said, tastes like a brownie, but in cookie form.  Will definitely be making these again!  So easy!  And my 3 y/o loved helping roll them in the sugar!

Only 4 stars cause of the gooeyness while rolling, but was easier once sugar coated...will start out that way next time. As for the taste, my kids said I should continue to make these all the time, so I will....they did taste great....just the right amount of sweetness!

These cookies are easy to make and look so impressive on the plate. By the way, they are also delicious! I will make them again and again.

I didn't have too much trouble with this recipe.  I froze half the recipe in my large bowl for an hour, and transferred it to the refrigerator for an additional hour.  I used my tablespoon to scoop the batter and used my finger to drop it into the sugar, where it was easier to form into balls in the process of adding sugar.  I agree with the other reviews that you must coat the pan well, and completely smother the cookie in sugar to achieve the crinkling effect.  The only downside is that I felt the cookie only tasted okay.

These are very good cookies for what they are. That is low fat, chocolate, and fast. I feel a little weird about the whole vegetable oil instead of butter/margarine, but it made them that much easier I say! I cut the baking time down to about 8 minutes and they were nice and gooey in the middle. They also look very pretty!

This is such a great "go to" recipe!  It is so easy, with the oil instead of butter that it goes together so quickly.  People always LOVE them.  I make them often.  Making them for a group of teachers today!

Good cookies! Taste a lot like brownies! My only changes: I oiled the cookie sheets and sprinkled the confectioners sugar on top. I think next time I'll divide the cookie dough so that it chills with more surface area because it was the top part of the cookie dough that was least sticky and easiest to handle.

SO good!  Although it's funny - I wasn't crazy about them right out of the oven, but when I ate some the next day, I nearly swooned.  Oh, and I also added two semi-sweet chocolate chips to the center of each ball of dough, then topped each finished cookie with two more chocolate chips, which kind of made them look like round ghost cookies.  Delicious!

When I mixed the dough together, and chilled it, it wasn't dry enough. I couldn't roll the dough in powdered sugar because the dough was too droopy. However, when I baked the cookies, they were perfect. They were a little less sweet than I imagined. However, overall a very good recipe. :)

I had high hopes for these, but found them lacking chocolate flavor, despite the addition of 3/4C. mini chocolate chips to the batter.  They came out beautiful-looking, but not chocolaty enough.  I used Nestle's cocoa; maybe I'll try again with a higher quality brand?

These cookies are very simple and delicious.  I took other people's advice and greased the pan instead of using paper.  I also rolled the dough balls in granulated sugar before powder sugar.  It gave them a subtle crisp.

This was an excellent recipe. very much like a brownie more than cookie and well worth the effort of making them. I took someones advice in just greasing the cookie sheet and the came off beautifully. and I used only whole wheat pastry flour for a slightly more healthy and gluten free version and they came out great!

I love this because my two girls can help roll the balls and put them in the powdered sugar.  They turned out fabulous.  We made a whole batch hoping to have some extra to take to a Super Bowl party, but there were none left!

A regular both at the deli/bakery I work at, and at home for many years. Always so pretty to display, even if they are messy to eat!
Using the pre-melted packets of chocolate, seems to keep the cookies softer.

I made these cookies this evening.  While they look beautiful and have a nice texture, they just didn't have the intense chocolate-y flavour I was hoping for. If I make them again I will definitely increase the chocolate content, and probably add a little cinnamon for additional flavour.

Yummy and easy to make! They weren't as chewy as I expected but still very good. I might use half brown sugar and reduce the eggs to 3. I used Ghirardelli chocolate and wow- so good! I might also include some coffee liquer next time to bring out that rich chocolaty flavor. Very good on it's own, but with a few tweeks,,, could be phenomenal!

Brownie like cookies.  I used a mini scoop and this recipe yielded 40 cookies that are about 2 inches wide.

My biggest suggestion is to put the dough in the freezer for 45 minutes instead of the fridge for 4 hours.  

Delicious, moist brownieish, crinkled just like in the pictures.  Fairly easy to make but just a bit time consuming.

Good tasting cookies!  They crinkled just like in the picture.  The problem was the dough, even after hours in the fridge, your hands warm it up as you're rolling it into balls, and it turns into a sticky mess. You end up with chocolate hands and only 2 dozen cookies.  Next time I would take small amounts of dough at a time out of the fridge.

These taste wonderful and literally melt in your mouth but they take a LOT of work! I found it very difficult to manage the dough when forming the cookies and had to repeatedly pop into the freezer for a few minutes to make it less sticky.

My sister and I are in love with the chocolate crinkle cookies that our mall cookie store sells.  I stumbled on this recipe two years ago and decided to surprise her.  Aside from doubling the recipe, I follow the directions exactly.  They are wonderfully moist (rich, gooey, chocolatey brownie flavor), keep nicely in an airtight container on the counter, and crinkle beautifully.  I have been making cookies from scratch for 35 years, and hands down, these are my favorite!

These are one of my Christmas baking favorites! Only a few comments... the only way that this recipe yields 72 is if you make them bite sized...which I do quite often for my trays (I like to try a "little" of everything!).  So I use the small Pampered Chef cookie scoop, follow the recipe except bake only 8 minutes...this gives them that chewy center that I like!  Definitely a 5 star recipe! Update:  Last few years have had trouble with cookies not flattening, staying in a ball shape.  If I flatten before rolling in powdered sugar and only bake 9 min. (using the medium Pampered Chef cookie scoop).   Also let dough set out of fridge for a while helped too.

I just made this cookie and it turned out great.  I have tried other recipes for this cookie before and they were as hard as a rock.  This cookie came out soft and chewy in the middle - (baked them for 10 minutes)  Only change I will make next time is I will add some nestle chocolate chips for some additional chocolate flavor.  Great recipe - Thanks!

Great recipe.  I followed it exactly and am very pleased with the results.  I did follow the suggestion of baking one pan at a time on the top rack.  Mine were crinkly and beautiful... maybe a little on the under-done side even at 12 minutes.  But that could be my oven, and I prefer chewy cookies.

These were pretty good.  I wished the actual cookie/cake part was a little sweeter though...then would have been 5 stars.

Awesome. I have been using this recipe for the last three years and they're always perfect. I do a few subs to make them perfect our way: 
-Sub extra dark cocoa  
-Sub butter for the oil  
-Sub peppermint extract for the vanilla and double the amount  
They taste like and soft and perfect Andes Candy in cookie form.

Perfect turn-out from the oven. I used wheat flour and I thought it gave it an unusual texture in the bite. My husband loved it anyway so I guess I'll be making these again.

They were fantastic!!  
I did, however, make my first batch on a baking stone which caused the powdered sugar on the bottoms of the cookies to burn.  I did the rest on a metal pan with parchment paper- perfect results :)

YUMMY!!  I followed this recipe to the "t" with one exception, for the first batch I couldn't wait the four hours!  It didn't matter.  They turned out delicious, perfectly crackled, moist, chewy...  everything you would want in a cookie.

Awesome. This cookie was a favorite of mine growing up and Mom lost the recipe (tragic!). When I found this one, we were saved...it's pretty close to identical. One note, though: don't ever buy cheap-o cocoa to bake these - go high quality and you will not be disappointed.

Made these yesterday and EVERYONE loved them!  I loved them too - they tasted fabulous (perfect for my chocolate craving) and were super easy to make.  I only chilled for about 40 minutes, though, because I was in a hurry to bake them before guests came over - they still turned out great!

Delicious, soft and so chocolaty!  I made this dough on a Friday but because of a heat wave in NY I didn't bake them until the following Monday (there was no way I was turning on the oven in 100 degree heat without AC:))  Regardless to the delay the were OUTSTANDING!  The dough was surprisingly very easy to handle when dropped straight from refrigerator into sugar - maybe the 3 day gap helped?  Also I did not use parchment paper but just sprayed the pans well with olive oil - they came right off no problems.  Crinkled beautifully and I really had to struggle to get some into the freezer before they all got eaten up.  Enjoy!!

Awesome cookies!!  These taste just like brownies.  My husband (who is not a big eater) has declared that he could eat 1,000 of them. :)

I did not have any trouble with the stickiness of the dough.  Our freezer has a "jet freeze" setting, and I put the dough in with the jet freeze for about 45 minutes.  If you get your hands slightly damp before rolling the dough in your hands, that will help, too.

I made fairly small cookies and still only ended up with about 70% of the stated yield.

These are as beautiful as they are delicious.  My husband's sister would make these for him every Christmas and he loves them, I have asked for the recipe several times and she wouldn't give it to me so when I came across this recipe on here I had to make them.....my husband thinks they are better than hers.  The only change I made was I didn't have four hours to chill them so I rolled them into balls, put them on a cookie sheet covered with parchment paper and placed them in the freezer for a half an hour till firm.  I baked them according to the recipe.  Thanks so much for sharing.

We found these cookies to be very hard to work with and didn't like the texture after they came out of the oven.  Not sweet enough either.  Probably wouldn't make again.

This recipe came out pretty good. The texture was a bit different than regular cookies - it had a bit of a cake/brownie quality to it. I had made several changes to the recipe: Instead of solely using vegetable oil, I used 2 tablespoons of butter and 3/4 tsp of oil. Additionally I chilled the batter in the freezer over-night. When rolling these cookies, I recommend that you work quickly - if the dough warms, it becomes mushy. The presentation is very pretty though!

The texture was great. The dough was a bit sticky, but still a simple cookie to whip up in a hurry and very pretty. The flavor was good, but could have been better. I followed the recipe as directed, but added two extra tablespoons of cocoa. It still wasn't enough IMO. I plan to tinker with the recipe a bit to see if I can increase that chocolate flavor.

A really delicious cookie!  Got rave reviews at a recent cookie swap.  Very important to chill dough before trying to make though--don't try to skip this step!

A suggestion... once out of the oven press a Hershey's Hugs candy in the warm cookie. We call them "zebras" in my family. They have been my 23-year-old son's favorite for years... especially at Christmas!

These came out looking beautiful and perfect, had a great crispy outside and very moist and soft inside...but just didn't have the super chocolatey kick I was expecting. Probably more cocoa next time.

These were pretty good. Next time I'd add some chunks of chocolate or something for a more chocolatey flavor. They're really soft and stay soft for a few days, but they dry out pretty quickly around the edges. I'd make them again, but a smaller batch so I don't have to throw so many out after a few days...

These were just okay.  I think using baking chocolate as opposed to powder would would have been a smarter decision...as it is, there is just something off in the taste.  I personally wasn't a fan, but my family and boyfriend LOVED them and keep asking for more -- hence the 4 stars.

Delicious cookies, the dough is easy to make, but it sure is sticky and messy to handle. The second time I decided to just put the dough in a square baking pan and cut them into bars, so it'd be easier. They didn't come out as pretty, but that didn't matter much to me. These taste just like little brownies! Thanks for the recipe. :D

I LOVE crinkles, and these came out moist and chewy.  I made only one change... instead of refrigerating the dough, I made a "slab," wrapped it in plastic wrap, and popped it in the freezer while I cleaned up my mess in the kitchen.  I waited about 1/2 an hour and it was perfect to use a medium size scoop. 

A word of caution... you might think they're underbaked when you pull them out of the oven at 10 minutes, but you'll OVERbake them if you leave them much longer.  I (accidentally) left a sheet in for just under 12 minutes and you could definitely tell a difference in texture.  The next time I make these, I'm thinking I'll add shaved Andes Mints into the cookies for a little twist!

This is fabulous!! I followed the recipe/directions as posted and I had no problems with them at all.  They taste great and look just the the pic. The only difference in mine was that I added chocolate chips in the batter. The texture is very much like a brownie... YUM. While I was making them, I was trying to think up some variations and I will try white chocolate chips next time, or perhaps some mint extract or even a hershey kiss in the middle..........The possibilities seem endless.. This recipe I will make again and I will keep forever! Thanks.

These were a big hit at our house.  I did put them in the freezer for an hour like many suggested and they weren't too sticky, not bad to work with.  They crinkled very nicely and looked just like the picture!  We will definitely make these again, hubby would like to try nuts in them.

Great recipe! I made them to bring to a wine and cheese party and they were a huge hit. They basically taste like little brownies. They cooked for quite a few minutes longer than the recipe called for, but that might just be my oven. I put the batter in the freezer for exactly one hour instead of the refrigerator, and it worked great.  Also, though I rolled them in powdered sugar they didn't quite look like the picture - not that it mattered, but just so you know. You probably have to wet them to get that appearance.

These Cookies turned out perfect! I didn't think they were too messy as long as the dough is refrigerated.

I'm bringing them over to our family Christmas get together today and I just know they will be devoured!

Very good cookie.  I didn't have any big problems with rolling the dough (but I did put it in the refrigerator for a few hours) and my cookies crinkled just fine.

I didn't have parchment on hand so I just greased the cookie sheet.  It turned out fine.  I do wonder if putting chocolate chips in the batter would make the cookie even better...I might try that next time.

Wonderful recipe as is though!

Loved making these and the hubby and little ones loved eating them!  Great recipe!  P.S. one review said they used oil because they didn't have enough parchment paper, you can reuse the parchment paper for the whole batch.

Best Crinkles I've ever had.  Might even try them with the new Dark Cocoa.  Tip for rolling them into perfect balls: keep rinsing your hands with really cold water, dry, roll. Thanks!

Turned out nice and puffy, not thin at all.  Fun to make with kids.  I will make these again.

These were very very good.  I froze the dough for an hour and popped it back in the freezer between batches.  Addictive!

This cookies were pretty good. I would add some melted choclate to the recipe like others have suggested. It would give them just the flavor kick they need!

Great, chocolately, easy cookie. Been meaning to try a crinkle cookie recipe for a while and glad I chose this one. Will add to my regular Christmas cookie list.

I LOVED this recipe!  I used 2/3 cup Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa powder and 1/3 plain cocoa because they were looking so black that I got a little scared.  Anyway, it was great!  Maybe next time, I'll use all Special Dark!  Thanks Ingrid!

I tried cooking them for 8minutes, like some suggested here but they turned out mushy. Just followed the recipe as is and it turned out perfect!  

Chocolate flavor and texture are great!

These cookies were very good.  I used shortening in place of the margarine because I didn't have time to chill the dough.  They turned out nicely, but with using the shortening, they retained their ball-shape so I flattened the cookies with my hand after this discovery.

If you're having a chocolate fit, these will work but....  They didn't seem chocolaty enough for me.  Next time I think I will add mint extract and dip them in chocolate (like the girl scout cookies).  I chilled the dough, rolled them in logs, covered them with plastic wrap and froze them.  Then when they were frozen I pulled them out and cut cookies off.  It was much easier then the directed way (I tried that way too!)

These are great I made half the recipe because the full recipe said it made 6 dozen. That was not a good idea because half the recipe only made 20 cookies.Maybe I made them to large? I need to mix up more of these tonight because they won't last through the night with my husband around.

The cookies were so-so, turned out a little dry.  My family did not devour them like I thought they might since they are brownie lovers.  I probably won't make this recipe again.

I over-baked my first batch which turned out tough. So, I carefully monitored the next few batches. These cookies turned out chewy and yummy! Anyway, I had a problem about its appearance, though. It didnt get those "cracked" tops, which a normal cookie crinkle would look like. I just got a plain, round, normal-looking, chocolate cookie. But, anyway, these tasted great!! Oh, and eventhough I left the dough overnight in the fridge, it was still too sticky and hard to handle...

Very easy and great chocolate taste. I baked them on a baking stone for 13 minutes. - Perfect for my cookie exchange at work.
