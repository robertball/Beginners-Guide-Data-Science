I made this recipe exactly as above, except I didn't use Dave's Steaksauce.  Instead I made my own with 2 Tbsp Worcestershire, 2 Tbsp Vinegar, 2 Tbsp Brown Sugar and 4 Tbsp ketchup.  The whiskey we used was some cheap stuff we've had for years but never opened until now!  I think it was Old Crow?  Anyway, great recipe and I'll make it again.

This was a very good recipe, I followed it just as written. The only change I would make is that I would use smaller pieces of bacon. I used 1/2 slice per piece of duck and the ammount and flavor of the bacon over powered the duck. The marinade worked well and I did pre-marinade the duck pieces on salted ice water to remove the 'gamey' flavor. Over all this was a very good recipe and I would make it again.

Finally a recipe I can use for a duck that has been skinned! We used to pluck our ducks but hubby does taxidermy, so now we just skin them and losing the fat makes the meat dry. This is way more exciting than just barding the meat. Thanks Karab! :)

Great recipe! I cooked this for my husband and his parents. It tasted a lot like steak to us! I borrowed from the person who used Vinegar and brown sugar, and I used A1 Steak sauce and some Wild Turkey. Marinated the breast with for about 6 hours. However, I fried the bites then placed in the oven at 300Â° for about 15 minutes. It was new to us and we all liked it much more than any other duck dish we've had before.

Used Soy Sauce instead of Dale's...will try Dale's next time.  We absolutely LOVED this.

This is the traditional way (more of less) that we do all of our duck and goose in my house.  To kick things up a notch, we often add a slice of jalepeno pepper, pepperocini, water chestnut, or banana pepper with the duck, then wrap the bacon around both and return to the marinade until ready to cook.  DO NOT OVERCOOK the duck.  When the bacon is close to being done, you're ready to go.  If the bacon gets very dark and crispy, you may not be as happy with the results.

My son shot a few geese on the 23rd of December and I was debating on what to do with them....roast, throw in the freezer...but I went to the web and found this quick and easy recipe.  

Didn't have any dales (but very familiar with it) so I opted for another reviewers suggestion - as follows:  2 T. Worstershire; 2 T. red wine vinegar; 2 T. brown sugar; 2 T. ketchup (however, I doubled the above as it was over powered by the bourbon.  I also added a slice of jalepeno to each.

They flew off of the table like they still had wings.....would and will make them again....5 stars

Awesome! We took these to a friends house after my hubby went hunting. I had wanted to try something new with duck and this just struck me as neat. I got great reviews from our friends. We'll be making this again but trying beer instead if whiskey, just to try something new.
