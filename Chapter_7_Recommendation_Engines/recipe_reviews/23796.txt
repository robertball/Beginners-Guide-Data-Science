I was so tickled to find this recipe!  I remember that applesauce jello used to be a real fad in the 70's.  After reviewing the reviews, I made a few alterations.  I used only 1 oz. of candies and only 1/2 c. of unsweetened applesauce to cut down on the sweetness.  I also didn't have any lemon so I substituted peach.  It was so good that my kids fought over it!  The next day I tried it with the lemon and it wasn't too good.  In fact, it was a weird combination so stick with the peach flavor!

One of my family favorites from childhood.  The texture from the applesauce makes it something different.  I think I used about 1 1/4 cup water and it turned out fine.  I have done it with cherry jello, but the lemon jello is used to give it a bit of punch to cover the sweetness of the candies.  Not for everyone, but a nice change of pace for those who want something different for their next gathering.  Serve with casseroles that have cream sauces or with ham dinners.

I made this for a baby shower. I used cherry gelatin rather than lemon. Be ready...It's VERY sweet! Also, if you are looking for something with the gelatin consistancy, this is not the recipe. I topped it with whipped cream. I received differing opinions ranging from, "This is really good" to "What the heck did I just put in my mouth!" LOL. I think it would be good for Summer cook outs though because it is refreshing. I'll make it again, mostly because I enjoyed watching people's reactions to it.

I've been making this for years, except I use 2 pkg. raspberry Jello, a quart of applesauce, and a package of cinnamon red hot candies dissolved in the water.  I also add an envelope of Knox gelatin to help in the firming process, and it fits perfectly into a green Tupperware jello mold.

Mine did not harden, and I didn't like the flavor either.

Easy and good.  Very strong taste and sugary.  I served with very flavorful foods and this was a nice compliment.

This recipe was not a good favor with the lemon jello, but it is excellent with Cherry jello instead.  If it wasn't for the lemon jello in this recipe, I would rate it 4 stars.

I have added this to the menu for Christmas dinner the past two years and my family absolutely loves it. I think the lemon works wonderfully. Although, I am thinking about experimenting with other jell-o flavors.

I have to say, this was an interesting recipe. I have never had anything like it and can't say, that I will again. No offense. I love red hot candies, Jell-O and applesauce but everyone that tried it in my house was perplexed on what to make of it. For one, it was extremely cinnamon-y sweet, it sat in the fridge for over 4 hours and held a shape for like 5 minutes and started turning into gelatin-y sauce. Was not impressed about it flattening while trying to take photos of it and I went so far as to put it in pretty mini molds for it's appearance but by the time I walked with it out of my kitchen and into my office where I have my photo box, it was almost pouring off the plate. Then just turned right around, went back to the kitchen put it in a bowl and called it done. Then emptied all the other mold together into a bigger bowl and back into the fridge. If it wasn't so overwhelmingly sweet and held it's shape, I might enjoy it better. Sorry my apologies.

I made it and loved it!  My mother-in-law (a very picky eater) ate 2 large helpings.  When I make it again, I will make a couple of changes:  not use so much water & add a little more applesauce.  Also I used cherry jello instead of lemon.  Will add a pic (before it gets eaten) and let you know how the changes work.  Kate

This is a family favorite with the family.  One thing that is necessary is to add a packet of unflavored gelatin (sprinkle over cold water first) - just don't boil all of the water.  Also, can't imagine this with lemon jello, we use cherry!

Try putting this recipe in pineapple chunks, then add a cream cheese with some mayo topping with chopped up celery in it, Its very tasty, I have tryed it without the pinnapple and its a good salad, but something about the pineapple really makes this salad.
