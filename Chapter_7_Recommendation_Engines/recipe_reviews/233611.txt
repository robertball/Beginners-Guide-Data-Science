Used this recipe on my jerky i make through a dehydrator and it turned out AMAZING. Just understand the teriyaki sauce is a big deal. If you get a runny one you will have drish meat but when a more thick sauce you get a nice glaze that stays on the jerky.

This marinade is out of this world great but the cook time is way off and so is the temperature. I smoked at 225° for 5hrs and the jerky was dry and crispy. I would recommend cooking at 200° for 4 hours for tender jerky cooked to perfection.

I used wild duck meat and also added red chili flakes because we like it on our jerky. This worked really good for me. I made another recipe the same day and put it in the dehydrator and this recipe came out better. Not only from the smoky flavor  from the wood chips but also the texture. I'm guessing this would work great with venison too.

First use of the smoker so still have some things to learn. Overal, turned out real well. Wife loved the taste but i did leave it on just a little too long or had the heat just a little too high. Also could have left the strips a little thicker than I did. Will defiantly try this one again to get it better. Still real happy with my first attempt at smokeing.

I do this recipe with island teriyaki marinade instead of regular teriyaki and it's great for those who don't like spicy.  I pair this with TBird's beef jerky (little bit extra pepper) and Jerky Lover's Jerky - Sweet, Hot, and Spicy for a variety of jerky to choose from.
