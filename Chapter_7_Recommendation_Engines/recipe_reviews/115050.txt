This drink is amazing!! The recipe is perfect as is, but when we ran out of chocolate liqueur, we substituted kahlua and a bit of hazlenut cream, and it was just as good!

Great drink, but be warned - it can do some damage ;o)

This was a pretty good martini...like dessert in a glass.  I used chocolate martini mix instead of chocolate liquer.  The irish cream was the dominant flavor.  But it hit the spot...kind of strong, but perfect for an early evening dessert drink.

This is a lot like a mochatini without the coffee liquour.I increase the vanilla vodka to a jigger and a half, it makes it less sweet, if that is possible. Love it!

I was so looking forward to trying this cocktail.  I was going to get the ingredients to make it this past weekend but didn't get to the liquor store.  But when my boyfriend and I stopped at a bar I asked the bartender to make it for us.  WOW - it is strong and I usually don't complain about that.  I think measurements are off ... I'd have to play with it to figure out what they should be but this definitely isn't it.  Also it might benefit from a splash of cream or 1/2&/1/2 to smooth it out.

Very good. This is more of a dessert martini than a let's sit and drink this all night drink. My hysband took a taste and said it was good, which he dosen't usually do.

I was looking forward to trying this. All my husband and I could taste was the Baileys Irish Cream. I kept diluting with the vanilla vodka but the Baileys was just too strong.

I've had this drink under the name "Death by Chocolate Martini."  A wonderful dessert drink under any name.

This is very good, but I did add a little of the cherry juice and a splash of milk because it's a little too strong for me! I also thought I had vanilla vodka but what I had was Van Gogh chocolate vodka so I'm sure the original way would taste a little differently, but both equally yummy!

I so wanted to love this. One of my very favorite desserts is Boston cream pie. I liked that it had a slight creamy flavor, but it didn't taste at all like Boston cream pie in my opinion. I also thought it had a little bit of a strength to it, more likely from the amount of vodka. I ended up having to fix it, to cut through some of the vodka's strength. I didn't understand the point of the cherry either. Boston cream pie doesn't have cherries. If it was for decoration, it kind of just dropped to the bottom and dissapeared. I luckily though had some leftover in the fridge, from the holidays, so it wasn't an extra cost. I really wish this would have worked for me.
