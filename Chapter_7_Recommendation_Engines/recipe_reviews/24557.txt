Makes good bread and wonderful toast!  

Had a bit of trouble with the recipe, because the first part instructs you to put milk, yeast and some flour to rise, but then it doesn't specifically tell you to mix it in with the big bowl of flour.  

My dough was almost too much for a 9" round pan.

The flavor is really good, and it makes some of the best toast I've ever had!  It's close to my grandmother's recipe, which I've been trying to replicate for several years.

great sweet taste.  also, really convenient b/c you don't have to knead it.  the texture leaves a little to be desired, but the taste makes up for it.  the only problem is that this needs to be in a 9x13 cake pan.  the 8x8 is entirely too small.

I used 1 tablespoon of yeast, 3/4 cups of milk, 3 eggs, 1 1/2 teaspoon grated orange rind, 1teaspoon almond extract, 3/4 cup brown sugar, 4 1/2 cups flour, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/2 cup melted butter and 1more egg for glazing with the almonds. I made it like ordinary bread rising three times and baking it at 350. It turned out perfect.

I prefer cake-y, not bready, vasilopita. But I decided to give this recipe a try anyways, just to try something different. Boy, was that a mistake! 

When making this recipe, I kept thinking, "This can't be right. This can't be right." The only flavor in this cake comes from cinnamon and nutmeg, and a half teaspoon of each to over 6 CUPS of flour? 

The crust cracked and separated from the loaf (a symptom of overproofed dough, yet the dough hardly rose during the 90 minute proofing time.) This vasilopita is one of the ugliest cakes or breads I've ever baked. The crust is extremely tough. I split the dough into two round cake pans (I can't imagine making this into just one gigantic cake, yet the recipe simply says "Put the dough into a pan,") and let it proof for close to 90 minutes (yet it hardly rose - no small wonder as there was a huge amount of dough.) When I put it in the oven, it rose very tall. Despite rising so tall and being a rather voluminous cake/bread/whatever it's supposed to be, it's a strangely dense fluffy... thing.

It was very easy to make. I am gifting this to a local restaurant owner with best wishes for a happy and healthy new year. I just thought it would be nice to have someone serve them something (traditional)  for a change. I only hope it tastes as good as it smells! Here's hoping for the best...I used a foil pan that was roughly the same size as the springform pan the recipe called for. I even baked a pure ounce silver coin in it.

In our family we use mahlepi and not cinnamon/nutmeg which is our tradition. I also used two smaller pans to make it easier to share, and cut back on cooking time. Perfect.

This recipe was straight forward and if you have bread experience should not be a problem.  My only concern is with the recommended cook time.  The recipe says 40 minutes, but my bread was still wet in the middle at 40 minutes.  I use an instant-read thermometer to check bread (s/b about 190-200).  It took another 20 minutes to get to the correct temp. My oven is new, I will check to see if it is off. Other than that, it turned out well. I will use again.

Pretty simple recipe to follow.  40 minutes bake time was more like 60 to get the inside baked though.

This is a nice lightly sweet bread. Agree with others.. use 13X9 pan or be prepared for a mess in your oven. The texture is between a pound cake and a bread.. everyone enjoyed this
