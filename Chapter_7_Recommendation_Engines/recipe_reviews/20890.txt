Fabulous. I made it with chicken breasts and substituted Sazon con culantro y achiote for the achiote seeds. Excellent, excellent, excellent.

Great Recipe! I found that this one is great when I need a quick heathly meal that is light on the stomache & budget. I also tried this one with pork boneless ribs, turned out good, but not as light & quick to make as this recipe.
Thanks a million for sharing this one!

After reading the reviews about the recipe being "bland", I skipped the achiote step entirely and simply added a packet of Sazon with achiote to the first 7 ingredients as everything sauteed.  I also added 1/4 cup of store bought Sofrito (frozen Goya brand).  I added the 4 cups of water after the chicken was lightly cooked and then added the 4 cups of rice once the mixture started to boil.  My rice was cooked throughly, but even after 35 minutes of steaming, it was still slightly "wet" causing the rice to be sticky. The meal was very flavorful with the two additional ingredients added, but since my result wasn't from the original recipe, I only gave it 3 stars.  It's not exactly like abuelita makes, but it's a good start!

I'm Puerto Rican and I've had my share of arroz con pollo in my life time. This was not a favorite. I also do not like to have the bones in my chicken when I'm eating this dish. It's a family preference. So, I used boneless skinless chicken thighs. I had to change many things to make this come out the way I expected it.

Great recipe.  I made just a few small changes.  Instead of drumsticks I use boneless skinless chicken thighs.  Still great flavor but easier (I think).  Also I added Adobo seasoning for flavor and of course start with Sofrito that I make myself.
