Simple and easy way to dress up just plain pudding. One thing that I do with any pudding, is add some powdered chocolate ovaltine with the dry mix. I don't change the milk and it adds a nice chocolately flavor, makes the pudding richer (and sneaks in some vitamins). I made this and my kids loved it! Will make again.

PS If you are making it with vanilla pudding mix, try some Carnation Instant Breakfast, French Vanilla Flavor. 1 Packet per box of mix. Gives the plain mix something extra. I did that with the Oreos too.
