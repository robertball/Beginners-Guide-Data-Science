This was delicious! I scaled this down to 2 servings for just me and my husband. Followed the recipe to a "t", including the optional Worcestershire sauce. It crunchy, flavorful, and the fish was nice and moist. This would be great with any white fish, such as tilapia or haddock as well. I will definitely make this one again! Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious as is. Lightly salt the fish prior to cooking. The romano cheese adds enough salt as is.

I do feel bad, but this was not that good. The breading was more like a crust and VERY bland. The cod also took much longer to cook than the recipe dictates. This likely causes the issue with the crust. I would recommend using fairly thin filets. Perhaps I did something wrong.

We bought a ton of frozen cod because it was on sale for $5/bag for 2 lb.   I'm not even sure how many bags my husband threw in our cart; we LOVE fish.   That said, I needed more recipes!  This was great.  Where we live, I could not find a good Romano in town... so had to use Parmesan.  It was still fantastic!  I personally love Pecorino Romano and can't wait to make it with that.  Even so, it was REALLY delish and very flaky and tender... the flavors, blended together and also creating a wonderful buttery base made this really  good.  I changed nothing else. Hope this helps someone.  Wish I had thought to take a photo.. looks lovely as well!

The Pecorina cheese is quite salty so avoid salting the fish. 
I did not use the Worcester sauce and didn't feel the dish needed it. Other than that this is now a new favourite dish for me,

Followed the recipe as closely as I could.  We didn't quite have enough bread crumbs and I used Parmesan cheese because that is what we had.  It was delicious.  The mayonnaise and butter added just enough fat to make the fish taste rich and cod is a fish that maintains its firmness.

I never eat fish. My father and brother are fishermen and always brought home all kinds of fish. I never liked it. But everyone says we should eat less meat, more fish. Well I followed this recipe and guess what? It was great! This is my only fish recipe and I will make it again and again.

Very good!  I don’t really like fish but I’m trying to include more in my diet. This recipe will help me do that.
