Very good -- I also like to add  lots of chopped parsley.  I agree with the reviewer who said it needs some lemon juice.

Tasted like France... I liked it even better after I added some fresh lemon juice.  PS - 10 carrots make a lot of salad!

I ate this in France with tomato slices, cabbage, and boiled egg, with a parsley garnish. Good recipe; brings back memories. :-)

simple and tasty.  I ate this with some crusty french bread, and I think it gets better with time so refrigerating it is key.  Thanks for the recipe :)

I thought this recipe was a little flat and it was very dry too!  I will try it again and use fresh out of the ground carrots, instead of bagged ones.  It may have been dry because I used a grainy Dijon instead of regular Dijon and will use the smooth next time too.....sorry!

Wonderful small-plate healthy dish, but I'm not sure how to rate.  I wasn't crazy about the flavor but I'm not sure if that's because I don't care that much for Dijon or my store-brand of Dijon wasn't very good.  I expected the sweetness of the carrots to temper the Dijon more than it did.  I served this similar to the review and photo by alisha.n except no cabbage.  I put quarters of boiled egg between the carrots and tomatoes.  I will definitely make this again with a better mustard; maybe a bit of honey.  And maybe at serving stir the tomatoes into the carrots as they were very good together.  I'm always on the lookout for this type of dish; we ate this for dinner with some broiled shrimp.  My finace really liked it!

Love this salad!  My version calls for chopped olives sprinkled on top.
