Hello, I'm the author of this recipe.  You need to add about a teaspoon of cumin to the soup towards the end with the lemon juice.  The cumin and lemon juice make all the difference in the taste.

merely OK, which is odd because I usually love Syrian food.  Seemed like it was definitely missing something, even with the addition of cumin.  Was a decent way to use up some old lentils I had laying around but won't be making this one again any time soon.

This is a very good base recipe.  You need to add what you like but mine came out great.  I added carrots, corriander, cumin, garlic salt and tabasco. 
This is a perfect post workout meal packed with protein and low in fat.

Wonderful recipe! I added two bay leaves to the boiling water and lentils, making sure to take them out before step 2  I added a cup of vegetable stock after adding the lemon juice and spinach. The cumin and parsley were a great addition and cracked pepper is a must in my diet!! Delicious!

I added more spinach and the recommended cumin. We really enjoyed it. Ours came out less like a soup than like a thick stew, though... and I added in additional water and skipped the step with the flower.

Seemed like it was lacking something.  I used some bone broth as part of the liquid; added some pepper and fresh parsley when it still seemed like it needed something more.  I think I'll try adding some turkey or some spicy sausage when/if I make this again.  At any rate, my baby seemed to like it.

I added carrots and I think it needed more liquid so I used chicken broth and water, about 2 1/2 cups all told.  Very good, hearty taste.

This is an easy recipe for a healthy and tasty soup. I tweaked the recipe a bit by adding chopped ginger and garlic and skipping the lemon juice. As green lentils have their own characteristic meaty taste the ginger and garlic brought out a great flavor.

Delicious thick, lemony soup! I ended up needing about an extra cup of water to make the lentils soft enough,  and added a tsp each of cumin, coriander, and black pepper, plus 2 bay leaves with the lentils that I took out after. Made it spicy and flavorful. Great base to add whatever flavors you like best

Wonderful soup! I added coriander,  fresh garlic, 1 jalape√±o pepper, fresh parsley, fresh ginger and fresh cilantro. Also opted for vegetable broth instead of water. I find the flavors melded perfectly.

The only problem i found was the serving size. It said for 4 people. There was no way it was going to feed my family of 3. Not even doubled was it ok. We usually have larger bowls of soup and Luke leftovers. I edited to make a full pot. So i had to add more water and some chicken broth, more spinach and onion. It was good with the addition of turkey sausage and cumin like others said. I will make again with all the emits i made. But as it stands it will probably only feed 2 small adults.

Found this recipe after enjoying a similar one at a restaurant. Using the author's recommendations below, I triple the recipe, adding 1.5 cubes of chicken bouillon when cooking the lentils. At these proportions, I add an entire bag (171 g / 6 oz) of prewashed spinach without bothering to chop it because at the end I use a hand-blender to create a chunky puree. Great this way as the flavors really meld and there are no stringy pieces of wilted spinach. A favorite soup of our home now.

Excellent as a full meal for 2. I skipped the flour but followed the recipe exactly with the cumin and veg stock instead of water. Next time I will not use salt and try garlic instead.

This soup was okay. It's  very easy  to  make. It tasted  better  the next day. If I  make  it again  I will  use chicken  soup  instead  of  water  for a base to give it a little  more  flavor.

This was really good on a cold day. No special ingredients and it came together fast. I think if it didn't include lemon juice it wouldn't have been anything special, so don't leave that out if you make it. I had to add more water than called for, and I also included some precooked chicken sausage to make it a bit heartier. I gave it 4 stars because I felt like it needed more spice or flavor. I'll definitely make it again. (I just read the authors note, which isn't included in the original recipe, saying to add cumin at the end with the lemon juice. If I had known that before I probably would have given it 5 stars.)

Quite tasty and appealing. This was a nice, simple soup. The only change I made was to add a little bit of fresh garlic, and I did add the cumin as the recipe author suggests. I do think one could add quite a lot more spinach and it would taste even better.

This was a super simple quick and delicious meal. I did add carrots because I had them. Not a cumin fan, so skipped it and added a little more garlic. As others recommended used a chicken broth. My 87-year-old uncle loved it. He needs to eat more protein and this is an excellent way to do that! Thank you.

One of my go-to lunch options, and definitely freezable. I generally leave out the flour so that the broth is a bit thinner. My only tip would be to use a wooden or metal spoon to cook the onions - a plastic one will start to melt from the constant heat.

I added garlic with the onions, used chicken broth, added cumin with the lentils. When it was done I drizzled olive oil on it for added richness. I like it.

I doubled the recipe.  Used 2 teaspoons of cumin for the doubling and 1 ounce of lemon juice.  This was a perfect balance!  Also used turkey stock instead of water, and served with toasted pita.
