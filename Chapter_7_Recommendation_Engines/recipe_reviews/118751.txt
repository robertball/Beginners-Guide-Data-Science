Soooo good! Used 1/2c orange juice instead of grape cause it what was on hand, 1/4c oilve oil, 1/4c soy sauce and used a bunch of "garlic scapes" that I was gifted from a thoughful neighbor. Loved the toasted sesame seeds and the other ingredients, marinated for 24 hours. Fabulous flavor...served with steamed edamame. Thanks!

I made this for my dad's belated birthday celebration recently and it was a great addition to the party.  I had less than optimal conditions and  had to keep the half batch that I made warm in the over for about an hour.    Even after all that time, the chicken was very moist and flavorful.  It wasn't too salty like many Asain or Tropical inspired dished can be.  Everyone loved it and I will likely be making - the full batch this time - again in a week or so!

My family loved this recipe, I will make it again.  Chicken stayed moist and was even better the next day chopped up on a salad.

A delicious and easy recipe. I made mine on our Foreman Grill and brushed the chicken with leftover marinade several times while grilling to ensure the chicken was extra flavorful and got coated with the sesame seeds - it was perfect!

This is fantastic!  I substituted apple juice for the grape juice, since that's what I had on hand, and I only let the chicken marinate for about 45 minutes before dinner.  I also skipped toasting the sesame seeds due to lack of time.  I brushed lots of marinade on while grilling and this turned out so good!  My 1 yr old, 3 yr old, and hubby all loved it too.  I can't wait to make this again!

Really great flavor! I'm not a fan of teryaki and was afraid this would turn out like that.  Fortunately, it didn't.  I'm only giving it 4 stars because I altered it with what I had on hand (real apple juice, spicy prepared mustard, and freshly grated ginger).  I also had a fresh jalepeno so I thinly sliced that and it added a great kick.  We'll be sure to try "as-is" next go 'round ;o)

Did not care too much for this chicken. I had to add a bit of sugar and some honey in sauce because I did not like the flavor of chicken. Will not be trying again. Thanks anyway.

This was good, although my g/f liked it more than I did (which is rare)...I was expecting it to be more flavorful/stronger. I did go a little lighter with the pepper (as she doesn't like anything peppery/spicy), used garlic powder instead of cloves, and apple juice (like another reviewer) as I knew the rest of it would get used where as the grape probably wouldn't.  Let them marinate for 18 hours, so they were nice and juicy...but was just expecting a little more flavor.

Loved it!  I only had an hour to marinate it and it was amazing.  I can only guess how awesome it will be if I do it for a full hour.  My 4 year old said it was un-freaking-beliveably good.  :)

This is a very good, easy recipe.  I used dry sherry instead of grape juice, simply because that is what I had on hand.  Otherwise, followed the recipe.

Delicious and so easy.  I used orange juice instead of white grape juice and probably doubled the amount of ginger.  We also used it on pork instead of chicken, but it really would be good on any kind of meat.  Definite keeper!

This was delicious! I would just recommend using low sodium soy sauce since it can be a little salty, but this was one of the best chicken marinades I've ever had.

I LOVE this recipe and make it once per week because it is soooo good!!!  I usually use chicken breast tenders to toss it in a salad or serve it over brown rice.  Thanks for the recipe!
