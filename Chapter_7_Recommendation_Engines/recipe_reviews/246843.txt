Definitely a 5star recipe. The crust is soooo tasty (more butter than usual), and the entire dessert was very easy to make! I used green apples because I love the tang more and the lemon with this recipe made it absolutely perfect. There is A LOT of sugar used, but it makes it pretty darn delicious. Thanks for the recipe!
