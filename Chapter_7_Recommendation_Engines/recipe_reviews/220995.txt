We didn't like the Chinese five spice powder flavor.  It was just an off taste to us.

This is an excellent recipe! To the reviewers who said that they had too much liquid after baking or that the crust never rose to the top, YOU USED THE WRONG TYPE OF FLOUR. This recipe calls for self-rising flour, NOT all-purpose, and there is a difference!
I made this as directed, subbing cinnamon for the 5-spice powder (I have simple tastes!) and it turned out wonderfully and was delicious!
A little trick for helping it to set better. After the bake time is over, turn the heat off and let the cobbler remain in the oven for a while to cool. This will let any remaining liquid boil off while not burning the dessert.
You should eat this warm though, rather than room temp. (Just my opinion!)
All in all, this is a great recipe. You can't go wrong with Chef John!

Came out perfect! To the people who do not have self-rising flour: For every 1 cup of all-purpose flour, add 1 1/2 tsp of baking power and 1 tsp of salt. Mix that together and you should have self-rising flour. It worked perfectly for me. Also I did not have Chinese five spice so I substituted it with cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg. I'm no longer intimidated to make peach cobbler!

Very simple and easy recipe! Only thing I did different was up the temp to 375 and bake time to 55 minutes! I knew from previous cobbler recipes I had tried that the bake time and temp may be a little off! But the final result was eXcellent!

I didn't have any Chinese 5 Spice, so I substituted Pumpkin Pie Spice and some ground chipotle. The flavors were fantastic, but there was SO much liquid in the finished product. I'll cut the simple syrup to half a cup next time, which ought to do the trick.

This came out looking perfectly, the crust was nice and golden and the syrup was all pretty inside. The problem was the sweetness. I did feel weird using two cups of sugar, one for the syrup and one for the crust, I should have trusted my gut instinct because it was way too sweet. Also the Chinese spices killed it, that anise flavor is hard to get rid off and is too strong. So I just bought another set of peaches and will try this again with only one cup of sugar and cinnamon. We'll see how it comes out.
UPDATE: I made this again last night and only used 1/4 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar with 1/2 cup of water for the syrup. 1/2 of white sugar to mix with the flour. Melted the butter in the oven in the same baking dish. Replaced the Chinese five-spice with 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Result: AMAZING.

Made it as written with an additional 1/2 t cinnamon to the peach mixture and the oven at 375 instead of 350.  Mine was not runny, however I made sure to boil the peaches for a full 2 minutes at a rolling boil & that thickened them.  Good taste, but I prefer a more tart cobbler and would add lemon juice or tart berries next time.  The batter on this one traveled throughout & was a bit more like thick custard than the traditional cake-like dough.

Great flavor, but after an hour and a half on 350 degrees, there was still so much juice and uncooked batter that I had to add an oatmeal/butter/flour topping to help sop it up a bit. Like the 5 spice flavor. Very good flavor.

I made this and was somewhat concerned it would be a failure because of all the neagative reviews and time/temp modifications suggested.  Do not increase the temp or cooking time it was perfect as written.  I turned the temp to 375 as suggested and the cobbler was browing was too fast.  350 is perfect.  I used Vietnamese cinnamom instead of 5 spice powder and added a couple teaspoons of lemon juice to the peaches to keep the color bright and add freshness.  As suggested, I did not add all the syrup to the the baking dish (discarded about 1/2 a cup).  I wonder if some did not use self-rising flour.  That is key.  I used the recipe from this site for SR flour.  Turned out perfect-golden brown, buttery and not too sweet.  Served it warm with vanilla ice cream.

there was so much liquid left after it was baked that it over-flowed! either you need to add more flour to the batter or you need to cut back on the syrop

I love peach cobbler. I normally make a rolled crust, but thought I would give this recipe a try. It's delicious! I used cinnamon instead of five spice powder. Some reviews say there was a lot of liquid in the pan after an hour. I baked mine for 50 minutes, and it was perfect. I think the type of dish used matters so use something similar to the one in the video.

I use a very similar recipe that I have had for years.  We make this awesome cobbler every time we go camping as it is requested by our fellow campers!!  Ours is cooked in a dutch oven in a hole in the ground with hot coals.  YUMMY!!!

I recently received a box of peached from the fruit of the month club and didn't have clue what to do with them. Luckily, I found Chef John's Peach Cobbler recipe. I made it exactly as written (and shown on the video) and it was fantastic! I particularly appreciated using Chinese 5 Spice instead of Cinnamon, as it added a new twist to this classic. The recipe is very good just as it is, but if I were to make a suggestion, I'd add an additional cup of sliced peaches. Thanks, Chef John.

So very good!  Didn't have a dutch oven so split it between two casserole dishes and it still was awesome.  Used canned peaches and allspice instead of chinese five spice as that is what I had.  Was fantastic.  Made it twice already.  I also did not have a problem with too much liquid and followed the cooking time/temps exactly and it was perfect.

Easy and delicious. I used fresh peaches and a tsp. of nutmeg and 1/4 tsp. cloves. I didn't have self-rising flour, so just added about 2 tsp. of baking powder and a bit of salt. So good. I'll be making this again!

This turned out delicious but I did run into the same liquid issues that others have mentioned. About 10 minutes before it was to come out of the oven I saw the liquid and laid pieces of Italian bread on top to soak up the liquid and I put it back into the oven with the slices of Italian bread on top of it. After 15 minutes I took it out of the oven and all the liquid was gone and the Italian bread was not soggy just a little moist. Took the cobbler out and baked the Italian bread just a little bit more and Italian bread turned out to be nice and sweet, crunchy.

I made this recipe because I had a bunch of white peaches from my tree that were all ripe at once. It look a lot longer to cook than the instructions indicated, but turned out absolutely delicious. After it slightly cooled, I served it to my guests with vanilla ice cream.  It was a hit.  I was looking for a recipe that was a true cobbler, not a crumble or cooked peaches with biscuits on top.  This was more cakey, and certainly, heavenly.  Chef John has my endorsement.

Too lemony. I can have lemons all year but fresh Ga. peaches only for a short period of time. Perfer to leave off all the spices and enjoy peaches tasting like peaches. It looked beautiful though.

Used cinnamon instead of Chinese 5-spice. Cut sugar in peach mixture to 3/4 cp. Since others were concerned about too much liquid left after baking, I left out 1 cup of the liquid when I was loading the peaches into the baking dish. Used a large, deep Corning Ware baking dish (don't have a Dutch oven).  Tried 375 degrees, but lowered to 350 after top was quickly browned.  Baked it 55 minutes.  Cobbler came out great -- served it with vanilla ice cream & will make again.

Just might be the best peach cobbler on the planet!  What a great way to celebrate the opening season of fresh free-stone peaches. We live near South Carolina and Georgia, so peaches are a way of life for our family. I did't have any Chinese five-spice, so I used Chai tea seasoning and about 1/8th teaspoon nutmeg.  Our entire kitchen smelled amazing, and the cobbler wasn't even in the oven. Took it to a BBQ and everyone raved about it.  Kudos to Chef John for this recipe!

Made this exactly as posted except used used cinnamon instead of five spice powder.  It was delicious! Baked it in a huge cast iron skillet and the crust was heavenly and just enough liquid left.  Maybe cast iron just cooks better.

This was a pretty simple recipe and didn't require a lot of different extra ingredients that some of the other recipes where suggesting.  I didn't have the Chinese spice so I use Nutmeg instead and I also added Vanilla flavoring.  The next time I will need to make two because one was definitely not enough!

This recipe tasted great.  I have always been afraid to make cobbler but it is one of my husbands favorites so I went for it.  Read reviews but after all was said and done, didn't change much.  I didn't add the lemon zest and I didn't pour all the juices from the peaches in.  I did use canned peaches but I don't think that changed the flavoring to much.  Next time I will go ahead and add all the juice because mine wasn't runny like some others were.  I did cook at 350 for 50min but when it was done I shut the oven off, opened the door and let it still sit in the oven to cool.  
Very easy recipe to follow and very good taste.

This is my first time making or even trying peach cobbler.  I watched the video and followed the recipe exactly except for the Chinese 5 spice that I couldn't find in my grocery store.  I ended up using all spice instead.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and my cobbler turned out perfectly.  There was a lot of syrup but if you lay it on top of the batter as shown in the video and let rest after you take out of the oven for at least 15 min's it soaked it all up.  And was sooo incredibly good!!  Same temp and timing as indicated.

I am very excited about this version of peach cobbler, I think i will add my own spices to make it my own. And something that i have been doing for years when ever I make Peach Cobbler, Save the peach cobbler juice, and use it as a substitute to syrup for pancakes or biscuits, or what ever sweet bread you can think of just warm up the cobbler juice and have at it, just another option to all you peach cobbler lovers!!!

This cobbler was so good!  I couldn't fid my copy of the recipe and revisited the site to get it again.  It's that good that I wasn't going to make peach cobbler without this recipe.  I don't know if it's the five spice or what but it is great!

I've tried this twice now, following directions and ingredients and the video perfectly.  Both times the batter did not really form a crust, certainly did not crisp, and the peaches didn't really sink. The result was more of a spongy-soggy mess, neither texturally nor visually attractive.  Flavor is great - I don't like five-spice powder, but it was great in this.  Because of the texture, I'd rather make a plain old peach crisp (and add a little 5-spice powder) than ever make this again.

Great! Used cinnamon (3/4 tsp.) and 1/4 tsp. nutmeg instead of Chinese spice. Used coconut milk instead of regular since that's what I had; added extra richness. Next time I'll cut down a little on the sugar. Not a problem with too much liquid - I just turned off the oven and let it sit a couple hours and the crust turned out perfectly!

I was looking for something new to make instead of a cake for my husband's birthday. I did not have lemon zest, so I substituted a 1/2 tsp of dried lemon peel.  I also added a 1/2 cup of frozen mixed berries to the peach mixture after it simmered a minute or two.  It was quite tasty and a big hit with the husband.

Great, easy, and easily changeable recipe. I used half canned peaches and half fresh rhubarb. Instead of Chinese 5 Spice, I used a bit of ginger. Came out very good, although the top started to burn before it was really set. This could have been my weird oven, though. I cooked part in an 8-inch glass dish and part in a smaller, 3x7 disposable dish so I could give a bit to my neighbor. I still had about 3/4 cup of the fruit mix leftover, so I simmered it down and am freezing it for another great adventure.

I'll stick to my old recipe.  To begin with, it's way to sweet.  It's passable when first taken from the oven, but any left over, you may as well throw it now, because after it cools, it's not very good at all, At least I don't like eating dough.  I felt it was a bad waste of good peaches.  Sorry.

We made this recipe after reading several of the reviews and it was super easy and pretty good. Didn't have the chinese 5 Spice powder so used 1/8 tsp cinnamon & 1/16 tsp nutmeg. Also didn't use any of the peach syrup and it was plenty moist. We enjoyed it and will make it again.

I didn't care for this - it had no peach taste, just tasted like sugar and the chinese five-spice.  Next time I will just make it with flour, brown sugar, a pinch of cinnamon, oats, and butter all mixed together for the topping. I think there was too much sugar and the chinese five-spice had a weird taste!

I have made this cobbler several times already and love it.  The addition of the Chinese Five Spice gives it the unexpected kick!  I must admit that I don't use the amount listed, but will knock some off the spoon so it is less.  All in all, this is easy, tasty and so easy to adapt to your own liking.  I love putting cherries in with it as well and am experimenting with  adding different fruits in with the peaches.  This is a keeper for me.

First time I made this, I thought the filling-topping ratio was a little off -- too much cake, not enough peaches. Year later, I've cut the flour-milk part by 2/3 and according to reviews, also altered the filling. What came out was amazing, with significantly less sugar, but more peach.
...
If you're interested, this is what I did (although I pretty much eye-balled the filling based on my tastes): 5 ripe peaches sliced into a large saucepan (actually it was more like a wok lol) + lemon juice, two cinnamon sticks, a sprinkle of cinnamon/nutmeg/anise, salt, 1/3 cup water, and enough sugar to cover the top, around 1/2 cup (since i'm not a big sweet tooth). Let it simmer on med for 5-8 minutes to reduce and strengthen the peachy-ness. As it simmers, add more sugar as needed. Brown sugar also works nicely.
*The cinnamon sticks were a really nice touch. If you have them, use! (of course take them out before adding to the batter)

I cut the butter to 1/4 cup, and decided to bake it in a cast iron pan. I didn't have self-rising flour so I tried substituting it with AP flour + baking powder, but it didn't work. It still turned out delicious though.

I made it with Nectarines instead of peaches because my grocery store didn't have any peaches.  It turned out wonderful!  The self rising flour definitely did the trick because the top crust was wonderfully fluffy and crispy on top.  One thing to note is you need a pretty big baking pan to fit this recipe.  I used a 10" diameter x 4" deep pan and could not fit in all of the ingredients.

I'm giving this 4 stars because I didn't use the 5 spice and I cut the sugar in half because the peaches were so tasty. I cooked this in my 12inch  cast iron skillet, and I was afraid to put all the liquid in for fear it would overflow. I cooked for an hour it turned out perfect. I wish I had used a deeper pan so I could have fit all of the juice in. I didn't need to let it sit for hours because there wasn't a lot of juice left.  I don't know why every is complaining about lemon juice. It does not call for lemon juice its lemon zest. And it was just a touch.

Really liked it, but I thought it was too sweet. Great recipe though! I would recommend making it because it's very easy and tasty. I did not have self-rising flour in hand so I used a substitution of using 1 1/2 tsp of baking powder and 1/4 tsp of salt for every 1 cup of all-purpose flour. I would make it again next time I crave for some peach cobbler!

This was easy to make, delicious and beautifully puffed up. In my oven it was done after about 42min. I had to use canned peaches and pears because that's what I had on hand. The cup of sugar in the batter was a bit too sweet given the sugar in the fruit, so if I use canned fruit again, I'll reduce it to 2/3 cup. The Five-Spice powder was nice but I would have liked a little more spice. Next time I'll add cinnamon and a touch of nutmeg.

This was my first peach cobbler and I have to say, not only is it scrumptious, it is extremely easy to make.  This is something even a beginner can do and really impress their crowd.  I used cinnamon in place of the Chinese spice and lemon juice rather than lemon peel.  I do not have a cast iron skillet (although I am dying to have one) so I used a baking stone type deep lasagna pan.  Baked 50 minutes at 350.  The cobbler came out soft and chewy inside with a crispy outer crust.  I reserved some of the syrup and used it to put over once I spooned it into a bowl with some vanilla ice cream.  If you do not serve this with vanilla ice cream, you are not doing this dessert justice!!!

The shoemaker made a cobbler! I'm far from a chef, but Chef John's video inspired me to make something different. It turned out great without the Dutch oven. I used my large glass casserole instead. I also added vanilla extract because I love it. Eventually I'll break down and get a Dutch oven. It was bursting with flavor and very sweet. I loved it without ice cream. Thanks Chef for the recipe. I will add half the sugar to the flour mix next time.

I've tried many peach cobbler recipes...and this one beats all!
I did add a couple of cups of extra peaches, and cut the sugar in the simple syrup and the batter to about 3/4 cup each.
I used the Chinese 5 spice powder as directed but also added cinnamon and freshly grated nutmeg.

With the extra peaches, it needed another 10 minutes in the oven.
My husband absolutely LOVED it.

As is - just OK - ours we like much better.  We make a peach cobbler with self rising flour but use old fashioned oats in place of one-third of the self rising flour.  We then cut the butter in half w/out much loss. Makes more crispy.  Also since one of us is allergic to dairy, we used the juice from canned peaches or similar fruit juice in place of the milk.  Cut the sugar to 2/3 cup, and use cinnamon but not the Chinese 5 Spice.  We have used cinnamon & pumpkin pie spices or some combo of them - all spice, clove, ginger.  No anise though or anything resembling licorice flavor - yech. 
Tried this with thawed frozen raspberries and canned peaches - made a great melba blend.  So easy my husband can and will make it.  He is a better and more patient baker than I am - I cook, he bakes.

i've tried this receipe twice, using self rising flour and reviewing the video several times - the flour mixture never rises to the top - always stays under the peaches - not sure what i'm doing wrong,

I made this after finding some self rising flour.Never used this type of flour before but it was very light and produced good results. I too felt there was too much liquid leftover form the peach syrup but reserved about 1 cup to use on waffles etc. because the flavour of it was incerdibly good. I used allspice instead of the chinese spice as I did not have any chinese spice blend. Overall it was delicious and filled with peachy flavours.

For some reason the batter never baked as it should and the peach mixture was extremely runny.

I followed this exactly according to Chef John's recipe except for one thing; I didn't have Chinese 5 spice so I used ground cinnamon and ground cloves. The recipe was superb and super easy! The cobbler was a perfect golden brown. Using self rising flour is an absolute necessity for this recipe. The Colorado Peaches I used were super sweet so I should have cut back on the sugar a bit.  This was a hit with my entire family!!

Simple recipe with wonderful results.  Loved by all.  I did use cinnamon instead of the Chinese five-spice powder and made sure not to ladle all the liquid onto the batter.  Oh, I did make my own self rising flour using the recipe on allrecipes.com.  That worked great too.

Delicious ! It came out wonderfully, my family loved it! Since I was out of the Chinese five-spice I added nutmeg and cinnamon instead, but the next time I make this I will try it with the five- spice, it seems like a flavorful addition.

this is my go to recipe for peach cobbler and have made it at least a dozen times. I always have too much liquid when I cook the peaches (they are fresh and really juicy) so I simply don't add all of the liquid to the cobbler. Use your judgement! This always turns out great for me. My peaches are already sweet so I don't add as much sugar also. Great recipe and super easy.

I made this yesterday and it was amazing! Over the years I've tried so many cobbler recipes but none of them were what I was looking for which is like the one my Gram made many years ago. But this is THE ONE!  I didn't have any self-rising flour so I saw a make-it-yourself recipe for it in one of the other reviews and tried it and darned if it didn't work!  Other than that, I stayed true to Chef John's recipe as he hasn't let me down yet in any of his recipes that I've tried! This one was no different, it came out so well, just like my Grams did! Thanks Chef John (again)!!

The only reason this got a 4 rating was because I listened to other reviewers and used Bisquick instead of following the recipe.  Even though I seasoned the mix with brown and white sugar and cinnamon it still tasted like Bisquick .  The filling itself was divine!  I actually cooked up my peached the day before and just reheated a little before adding to mix in dutch oven.  Will definitely make again but using the dough as written.  Cutting corners typically doesn't pay off.

Best peach cobbler I ever made and tasted! I have tried several recipes and this by far the best! I agree that leaving the cobbler in the oven to rest instead of taking it out immediately does help with the liquid evaporating. I ate it with ice cream and it was a treat and I also ate it cold and it was a delight. Just try it with the self rising flour and you can't go wrong. This will be our family dessert for a long time.

The flavor is great here! I ended up using two extra peaches. Not because the recipe needed it, but because I thought I could. Don’t do what I did. It overflowed entirely. I used cinnamon instead of 5 spice since my grocery store doesn’t carry it and it tasted really good. I also cooked it in the largest cast iron pan I have—which I also wouldn’t recommend if you used two extra peaches. Lots of learning happened in my kitchen this evening, but super delicious learning nonetheless!

I made this exactly according to the recipe.  The technique makes for a lovely cobbler but, the amount of sugar is just too much.  A few recommendations:

Cut the sugar in half.  You will not need all that syrup so, use half a cup of sugar and half a cup of water for the syrup.  Don't bother peeling the peaches.  There's really no need.

Cut the sugar in half for the dough, as well.  It's just horribly sweet, as written.  I think I will use brown sugar, rather than white, for the dough, next time - more flavor, less sweet.

He uses Chinese Five-Spice because he has an almost fetishistic love of peppery flavors.  If you do, too, great.  If not, use cinnamon or pie-spice.

You really do need to use a Dutch/French oven for this to come out right.  A 3 1/2 Quart size works great.  A 5 Quart size would work better because you would get more crunchy crust and less sogginess underneath.

I followed the recipe except I did not have a pan big enough for the whole thing.  I split it into two bowls. The "cake" part only came up on the sides and did not cover the peaches as shown.  Flavor is great.

I don't know why, but this just wasn't what I thought it would be.  I followed the directions exactly and the crust was just strange.  Oh-the peaches were delicious, it was just the crust part that just didn't work for us.  The crust was some what gooey and lets say custard like while other bits were hard and fried like (where it met the butter).  My family and I just couldn't love this.

I think I'll make this again, but next time be sure the dish is deep enough.  I had a lot of syrup bubble over.  Thank goodness, I'd set the dish on a baking sheet.
I did make one change.  Instead of the Chinese 5 spice powder (which I did not have) I used pumpkin pie spice.

I used nectarines instead of peaches, and vanilla beans, cinnamon and cardamon instead of Chinese five spices.

I used 1/2 a cup of brown sugar to make the syrup and another 1/2 to make the batter.

Even my wife Kathleen who is an excellent cook/baker said the peach cobbler came out pretty well.

The youtube video was excellent.
Chef John...You are amazing!

I cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups; added vanilla to batter &  added another 1/4 tsp Vietnam cinnamon to 5 spice blend.  Prep time took me at least 30 minutes b/c it took me 15 minutes to cut up the peaches.  Cooked up just like the picture :D

As a peach cobbler junkie, I found this recipe to be quick, easy and satisfying. Have made 5 or 6 times now. Was not the hubby’s favorite, but I especially like that you can use canned peaches for a ‘fix’ anytime!

Have made this several times using different fruits  & found this works well with blackberries as well as blueberries. The five spice is the secret to this recipe.

This is an odd peach cobbler. The crust mainly stayed on the bottom, didn’t brown, the butter separated and to much liquid even after I removed about a cup before baking. I used self rising flour and followed the recipe as written but this wasn’t worth baking again.

I used his basic recipe.  I had just canned some peaches (using a lite syrup made with Truvia) and used about 1.3 quarts of the peaches, the syrup, and then added about a 2/3 pint of fresh blueberries.  Added orange zest, cinnamon and some orange juice to the syrup, as well as about 1/2 cup of Splenda Brown Sugar.  When I made the batter, I used Truvia again.  After layering the butter and batter in the baking dish, I spooned over the peaches and blueberries and then cooked down the remaining syrup somewhat.  Then spooned it over all of it.  Baked at 350 as directed.  And left it in the oven, with the oven 'off', for five more minutes.  It is perfectly amazing !!!  (I also added almond extract to the batter...)

This is fool proof recipe. Make sure to use a deep enough pan.  The first time I made it in a 12in cast iron skillet. The batter overflowed to the outside of the skillet. Not to worry, my fiance’ said he wished I could make a whole pan of what cooked on the outside of that cast iron. The second time, I used an old steel 5x9 pan at a house we rented. My guests raved. The 3rd time I used a creuet Dutch oven, and OMG! Cobbler perfection. Too bad I didn’t have anyone when it was fresh.  Oh well, there’s always a 4th time. I’ve been asked for the recipe twice. My hat is off to you Chef John!

I made this for a bbq and added in 4 small apricots to the peach es since I had them. I didn't have self-rising flour so as one of the reviewers suggested for every 1 cup of flour I added 1 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1 tsp salt. I needed to bake it for about 15 mins longer than the original recipe and the peaches mix didn't sink to the bottom. Although the cake portion stayed on the bottom it still tasted really good and stayed together well. My guests loved it and it was all gone by the end of the party. I would make it again.

My husband loved this peach cobbler and I liked making it in my cast iron dutch oven.  The flavors were lovely and we really liked the breading the way it worked to the top and became nice and crispy.

This is, hands down, the best peach cobbler I’ve ever had! I’ve made it 5 times already. Based on other comments, I was worried that the amount of liquid would be too much. Each time I made the syrup and cooked the peaches (1lb 8 oz) it would yield 1-1/2 cups of liquid. The first few times, I just added half the liquid but found that the cobbler was not juicy enough. When I finally added the whole 1-1/2 cups, it took longer to bake (15 minutes or so more) but the peaches underneath had the perfect amount of syrup underneath the crust. To my liking, I have added 1/4 teas of cinnamon and a few rasps of whole nutmeg in place of the five spice, but even without those changes, this is a five star recipe.

This was really good. It reminded me of cobblers I had as a kid. Ooey and gooey with chewy caramelized bits, almost like more like a souffle. We loved it. I did reduce the peach juice by half before adding it to the Dutch oven. Great recipe!  If you're looking for a cobbler with a flaky pastry crust, this isn't the recipe for you.

I have always enjoyed peach cobbler but felt intimidated to make one myself. I saw this recipe and felt empowered. I substituted the Chinese 5 spice with cinnamon and it was amazing.

I will definitely make it again, it was very good. Took away a star as I thought it was overwhelming soaked in butter. Will definitely use less next time. Other than that, very good peach cobbler!

I used 2 large fresh mangoes and no added water. I feel like the sugar and the fresh fruit juices make enough syrup as it baked. I used cinnamon instead of 5 spice and I baked it in my 12 in cast iron skillet. Came out fantastic. I made my ownself rising flour too.

I searched long and hard for a good peach cobbler recipe. All the others I'd tried were just too cakey and really over powered the peaches. I was about to give up on peach cobbler completely. This recipe saved the day. It's absolutely delicious.

The only problems I had was the dough didn't cook up. The cobbler was very watery, and it's currently on its third round of 50 mins. I'm not sure what happened. I didn't measure all the peaches. The first one came out to nearly 1 cup, and the others seemed the same size so I didn't bother measuring after that and just assumed 5 peaches would be 5 cups. Maybe that's where I went wrong.

I also didn't have self-rising flour, but I found a recipe online that said to add 1.5 tsp baking power and .5 tsp salt to 1 cup all purpose flour to make it self-rising. So that's why I did.  It rises just fine when we reheat in the microwave, so the only reason I assume it didn't rise in the pan is because there's too much liquid.

We'll have to play with the recipe and see what's up, but in any case it was delicious. Even the uncooked dough was wonderful. We will make again even with the issues we had. Definitely worth it.

I used 1/2 c water and 1/2 c white sugar and 1/4 c of brown sugar for the simple syrup,  and 1/2 c of white sugar with the flour.  The peaches I used were very moist.
I couldn't find the Chinese powder so I used 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg as suggested by others.  The peaches were quite firm when I bought them so I waited 2 days by which time they were soft and very good.
I forgot the lemon zest, which would have brightened it, but was quite good anyway.  A good and easy recipe.

This cobbler is excellent! The self-rising flour is imperative. As other reviewers have stated, I used cinnamon instead of Chinese five-spice powder and I baked at 375° for 55 minutes.  I also sprinkled cinnamon on top of the batter as it was rising in the oven. The result was a cobbler that left my husband scraping his bowl. He even sent me a message the next day about how he couldn't stop thinking about it??. I will be making this again, except next time I think I will use more peaches as our dutch oven is quite large.

I wasn't crazy about this.  I didn't care for the taste (albeit subtle) of lemon and it was too sweet for me as well.  Besides that, the top turned out too brown after only 40 min. in a 350 oven.  Could be because I live at altitude though.

I mistakenly thought I needed 3cups of peaches so I ended up making a smaller version. I used a deep 9in pie pan on top of a cookie sheet encase of overflow.  I used cinnamon instead of 5-spice and I didn't use lemon zest at all.  It took longer to bake than the recipe had said. I just kept checking it till the top was golden.  Many people said that there was too much syrup so I set aside part of the syrup instead of adding it all.  It turned out AMAZING!

Awesome recipe! I didn't actually have any self rising flour but I used the (1c flour + 1.5tsp baking powder + .5tsp salt) and I didn't have peaches, but I did have a bucketful of mangos... it still worked beautifully!!!

The self rising flour is an absolute MUST, and I did cut back on the sugar by about 1/4 ish and it still tastes beautiful. 

I'm planning on serving with coconut ice cream or maybe vanilla if I can't find any :)

Made *AS WRITTEN* and we loved  it! I'll admit when it was baking we didn't like the smell of it and questioned whether or not we were going to like it. But, we were pleasantly surprised :-) It took a much longer time to bake than stated though. .

Mmmmm.....Really good, although  I didn't use the 5 spice, I used cinnamon instead.  I didn't use any sugar either!!  I used "Stevia in the Raw", same amounts as the sugar, but NO calories!  Next time I make it, I think I'll double up on the topping.
Great with Chapmans French Vanilla Ice-Cream.
(That should make up the calories!)  :-)

I made it for my wife. She loved it. I don't care for peach cobbler but I liked it. A few said they didn't like the 5 spice. I don't think I tasted it. I'd probably double it. I used 6 cups of peaches instead of 5 could be the reason. I used the peaches I had peaches I had. I'll make this again.

To me this is more of a peach shortbread .   I didn't know how much liquid from the peaches to add when baking so I poured the simple syrup over everything after it baked.  This added extra moisture, but I wouldn't say it made it soggy. 
I did use delicious fresh peaches and used a whip cream for topping. I basically followed the recipe as written because Chef John has great recipes!

Prepared per instructions but after baking for 55+ minutes in a dutch oven, the top did not brown as much as I was looking for.  It was also a bit too sweet so next time I will reduce the sugar.  It was very flavorful. I will make again.

I did not have Chinese spice, so I added cinnamon , nutmeg and ginger. I got distracted and added butter to the batter but it still came out good. Easy to make with items right on hand.

Excellent cobbler. Used cinnamon instead of 5 spice and was delicious. Would make again and again. Used fresh peaches as they are in season. Would also make with canned or frozen in the future.

I made it gluten free, kept to the recipe but used krusteaz gluten free pancake mix for the batter.  I also substituted cayenne pepper and cinnamon for the Chinese 5 spice.  It turned out perfect. Rose great and browned like it was supposed to. Everyone loved it and I had no left overs

No changes. Based on the aroma I will not make any in future. Self rising flour means that the baking powder, soda is already there I think.  It seems that if regular flour is used then add the other ingredients?

Have made 3-4 times. This is very doughy so be aware that there will be a lot of crust.  I also used cinnamon, nutmeg in place of 5 spice.  Also cut the sugar for the crust to 1/2 and butter to 1/4 c.  Added a pinch of salt and a t of lemon juice.

The cobbler part still did not rise to the top.  It stayed on the bottom and did not cook through even after baking for more than an hour.

Very simple to make. I used regular white flour, lime zest, peaches from a can and walnuts.  One of the reviews said the peaches did not drop to the bottom of the dish because they used the wrong flour. So after I poured the peaches into the mixture I gently pressed them down and scooped up the flour mixture to cover the peaches.  In my opinion this was more like a peach bread pudding. Nonethe less it was delicious. In the future I would used less sugar.

Amazing! Added a cup of blueberries to the peaches in syrup while I waited for them to cool and the oven to heat. Used the convection at 350F, and it took barely 40 minutes to bake. Tested with a fine skewer to make sure the cake part was cooked. Also cut down the sugar in the batter to 1/2 cup. I divided this between a regular loaf pan and a smaller one. Unfortunately unable to upload photo. Because I had 4 cups of sliced peaches I cut back on the syrup, ie 3/4 cup of sugar and 3/4 cup of water. Will definitely make this again. Going to try a version using rhubarb which I will simmer for a few minutes in the simple syrup. Thank you chef John.

This was a delicious recipe! I did tweek it a bit. In place of the five spice, I used cinnamon and nutmeg, I added vanilla flavor, added 1 1/2 tbs of cornstarch to my canned peaches (used juice from peaches in place of water) and I baked for an hour...results were a juicy dessert with the perfect crust!

Followed the recipe exactly except omitted the chinese 5 spice powder.  I used a large oval casserole dish, approximately equivalent to a 9x13 pan.  I had no problems with it overflowing or being too cakey as other reviewers complained.  This was absolutely delicious and looked amazing when it came out of the oven.

This was easy to make.  I didn't use the spice he recommended. I just used nutmeg. I would add more sugar to the water when adding peaches.  That's the only thing I would change. Mine looked just like Chef John, but I didn't take a pic.

Forget the Chinese spice. As the others stated, mine had way too much
liquid after reducing  it in half.  It was easy to assemble and tasted good.

AMAZING!!  I have made this several times this summer and it has been a hit each time.  I have made it with peaches, peaches and raspberries and with blueberries.  Delicious!   I have directed many, many people to this recipe as a result.  I have made it in a 13 x 9 pan and that has worked well, although I have had to cook it longer.  I highly recommend it.

Turned out great!  Yes, there was liquid on top when I took out of oven, but the batter was cooked and the liquid thickened up to make a lovely glaze ontop.  The family devoured it!  I also didn't have Chinese 5 spice so used pumpkin pie spice.

My first cobbler, and it turned out fine, although after reading the reviews, I did not add all the syrup with the peaches, and I am glad I didn't, I think it kept it from being too sweet. I agree that the five spices add a different flavor but it grows on you, but if you do not like the taste of anise I would just use cinnamon and nutmeg or some traditional tastes. All in all though, I would make it again, I think the spice is an easily acquired taste. I also baked at 375 and even then it took over an hour.

I read a few reviews of people who felt they just had to change the spices--Well, you can make ANY peach cobbler recipe and use the same old things with the same old results--good, but nuthin' special. THIS one however USES Chinese 5 spices which creates THEE PERFECT marriage!
I never would have thought of that on my own--and I'm so glad Chef John did. This cobbler is absolutely DELICIOUS! And just different enough to make you pay attention as you're savoring the fabulous subtle mix of flavors~ all I gotta say is WOW! SO impressed!  This is my new Cobbler recipe from here out. People who know my cooking KNOW I am a fabulous cook and this will help continue my treasured reputation! Thanks John!!! God bless you! Ü

I'm giving this 5 stars because I am a good "cook" but NOT a baker at all and it turned out REALLY good! It was easy and my husband loved it. I did not have the Chinese five spice powder so I winged it with cinnamon, nutmeg, and ground allspice. I used my Pampered Chef Dutch oven which was perfect. Thank you Chef John

Do you put the lid on the Dutch oven?  I took it off the last 10 minutes.  I wanted the crust to be "golden brown".  And with the lid on, the crust was white.    The crust did not turn brown.  Smells good!

This went really well.
I used canned peaches, instead of actual peaches & syrup. I thought the sugar was way too much though.
Considering the fact that the syrup is sweet enough, & I'll be eating it with ice cream, I probably won't put sugar in the batter next time.

I followed the recipe with some of the suggestions others made such as cinnamon instead of Chinese spice. dash of lemon juice as well as zest. Used raw sugar for all. Loved it but and would make again but with my old gas oven need to experiment with cook times and temps as although top was nice the center middle was too wet.

I've made this cobbler twice now , i didn't use the lemon juice or the Chinese five spice  and it was the best cobbler ever . I just bought fresh blackberries and I was wondering do I make them the same way I did the peaches , but use blackberries instead of peaches . Do I add the black berries to the the saucepan with 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup of water and simmer. For 2 to 3 min like I did the peaches ?

I made exactly as instructed and it came out perfect. It's my new favorite recipe for peach cobbler. The simplicity of ingredients allows the flavor of the fruit to come thru. The cast iron skillet is the secret!

Loved it!!  Didn't have the spice I used cinnamon instead.  I've added this to my saved recipes and I will have it again.

I modified this recipe by using blueberries and raspberries instead of peaches. It turned out perfect and very delicious.  very simple recipe that I will be making again using a variety of fruits.

I don't like peach cobbler, but I LOVE this recipe!  Thanks, an excellent way to serve up those peaches that go a bit past ripe.  EXCELLENT!

I did not care for this recipe. I used self rising flour from 2 years ago and did not use any lemon peel, but about a half Tablespoon of lemon juice.
I used all of the ingredients asked for, but changed the spice to Pampered Chef Cinnamon Plus spice blend.
The flavor is peachy and tasty, but the dough stayed at the bottom and now is a dense piece of dough that is NOT tasty. I was very careful to place the peaches on top and I used about 3/4 of the syrup. Baked for 1 hour 15 minutes at 350 F.
