I rated this the way I made it, not by the original recipe.  Instead of the cream cheese, just mix the crabmeat with the cocktail sauce and slice the cuke on the diagonal. I also used the canned shrimp and everybaody liked that just as much.  It's easier and lower in calories that the original.

This is very refreshing during the hot summer evenings.  I have found blending the ingredients and leaving sit to meld flavors for a while before spreading on cucumber slices is much better and still pretty also.

Well...I did not add crab. I did add chopped chives and garlic powder with a pinch of sea salt then finished with a small bit of roated red pepper.

This is really pretty if you beat the cream cheese until it is smooth and soft and then pipe it into swirls onto the cucumber slices. I used "Krab" (the formed chunks of crab substitute called surimi), which is nice because it is in bigger solid pieces instead of little shreds.

These ended up looking runny and unappetizing.  They tasted pretty bland, too.

I made this for a party and it didn't receive any praises from guests.  I made one first to sample and thought the cocktail sauce overpowered the crabmeat (and I think cocktail sauce is better suited to shrimp anyway), so I sprinkled with Old Bay seafood seasoning instead of using the cocktail sauce.  You could substitute baby/cocktail shrimp for the crab and use the cocktail sauce.

This is yummy and refreshing.  Nothing special, nothing spectacular - just good basic appetizer or snack.  Thanks, Lisa

I wish I had listened to DECAR48 & left off the cream cheese...perhaps they'd have gotten a better rating. I really like cukes & crab & thought I'd love this recipe but I didn't like it at all. I gave hubby a plate of 3 & he only ate one so guess he didn't care for them either...sorry. They are pretty though.

These are an excellent tasting and elegant looking appetizer that will make your calorie concious guests happy!  They are not too heavy and so won't fill your guests up.  I have also used a small cooked shrimp in place of crab and sometimes add a layer of cream cheese between the sauce and the cucumber.  I also peel the cucumber so that there are alternating strips of peel for nicer presentation.  A hit every time!

Meh. Nothing special. Easier & tastier to put smoked salmon on the cucumber.
