Ohkay, so I don't have cheesecloth but I do have a 4 cup coffeemaker so I cut the recipe down to work that way (brewed like Starbucks, two tablespoons per cup--I used Caffe Verona blend) and I added the cinnamon stick and clove to my grounds in the.....cone filter. After it brewed, I stirred in the (Splenda) brown sugar, vanilla and my own homemade chocolate syrup. Honestly? This was heaven. I didn't have whipped cream for the top but next time I make this, I'll be sure to have it on hand. This was wonderful and quite a treat. I did add just a touch of warmed half-n-half because I can't drink my coffee black.

OhmyGod!!! what a wonderful recipe. The 2nd time I customized it to our taste buds for a more robust taste: increased sugar to 1/2 cup, increased cloves to 2, increased coffee beans to 3/4 cup... to die for. The 3rd time I ran out of  whipped cream to I whipped 8 oz of heavy cream and mixed it with 4 teaspoons of sifted confectioner's sugar. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!!!

I'm rating this 5-stars because I've actually never had Mexican coffee so I am not 100% sure what it's supposed to taste like, but I would imagine this is a great version of it!  It is delicious, although I must say I think it must be an acquired taste.  It's a very strong flavor.  I scaled the recipe to 2 and because I did not have whole cloves or cinnamon sticks I used a little less than 1/4t ground cinnamon and a few shakes ground cloves.  Good recipe.

Really good on a cold Michigan morning. I just made this in my coffeemaker by putting all the spices and coffee together and brewing the coffee. The chocolate syrup was a nice touch. Making this in the coffeemaker made the process easier and the end result was super-tasty. Thanks for sharing!

I'm not sure what coffee blend would work the best with this recipe. I used the Duncan Donuts and it seemed a bit too acidic.

WOW! This is an awesome drink to warm you up. I was tempted to make myself a grownup coffee drinktoday but still had tons of snow shoveling to do so this looked like the right thing, and it was. Since it was just me, I used cofee I had percolated and heated it on the stove with seasonings and I used carob instead of chocolate for dietary needs. I will definitely make this again and may not wait for the next snowy day to do it!

I was looking for something different for an all-night study session from the ingredients in my kitchen.  I made this recipe without chocolate and with steamed milk in a french press.  It worked wonderfully!  The flavor is very nice.

I thought this was good. I am going to add it to my recipe box with the winter recipes because adding the clove reminded me of lightly spiced Christmas coffees. Or, I might try it again leaving out the clove. The only thing I changed was using an equal amount of instant coffee and I used lite chocolate syrup. I just poured it through a strainer then instead of using the cheese cloth method. The spiced coffee gave a nice warmth this chilly morning.

I made this for my husband and myself. I followed the recipe for the most part. I used about 1/2 cup of vanilla syrup instead of extract and I poured it straight through my cone filtered coffee maker when it was ready. Topped with cool whip this was delicious.

I don't have a cheese cloth so I threw the cinnamon stick and the clove along with the coffee into my Ninja Coffee Bar cone and brewed it that way. I topped it off with fat free whip cream and a bit of chocolate syrup, I enjoyed it.

This is so tasty! I made it as a pick me up for two friends that were having a rough day. They really enjoyed it! I omitted the clove as I was out and this was a last minute thing. I used homemade chocolate syrup. I also used some cinnamon flavored coffee and a vanilla coffee k-cups.

Did exactly as directions said, but didn't taste that great. By the time it was strained the coffee was cooled down a lot. Had strong taste from either the clove or cinnamon, couldn't tell for sure which. Won't be making again.

A nice version of Mexican - style coffee drink. I used unsweetened cacao mixed with some hot water instead of chocolate syrup. I was also too lazy to whip my cream. I liked it and so did my daughter. Thank you for the recipe.

I needed a pick-me-up for this chilly May afternoon (46 degrees!). This hit the spot. I loved the clove and cinnamon. I cut back just a bit on the brown sugar. I sprinkled a little allspice on the whipped cream. I don't have cheesecloth, so I put the cinnamon and clove in the carafe of my coffee maker and let it sit for about 5 minutes after it brewed. Then I stirred in the brown sugar, vanilla and chocolate. I'll definitely make this again.

Okay I cheated.    I put ground cloves and cinnamon  into the hole in a kuerig pod and then added brown sugar and chocolate syrup.  So my version was inspired by this recipe, call mine cheater for one.

I like this drink. The spices were subtle to me, certainly not overpowering, and the chocolate was the perfect amount. I can see this being addictive in the wintertime, maybe because cloves and cinnamon make me think of the winter holidays. My biggest problem was the straining. I didn't have cheesecloth, so I used coffee filters which took time. I may try brewing this in my coffee pot next time to see if the taste is similar. It would certainly be easier.

This is an awesome recipe, I normally strain my coffee with a cheesecloth colador anyways.  It was very good, the only problem is that right now I only have two coffee drinkers in the house so I now have to make it when I have people over, otherwise, I just drink way to much coffee in one day, lol
