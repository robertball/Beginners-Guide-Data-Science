Bulk making waffle day--I doubled the recipe. I only made one change, I used half whole wheat/half AP flour. After all the dry ingredients were folded into the wet, I noticed that the batter seemed to be quite thin. I ended up adding an additional cup of AP flour. These puffed up nicely and turned out well. Using half whole wheat flour made them sturdier and more filling. I will use this recipe again.

My wife and I loved this recipe the first time we made but the second time, we wanted to "Jeep," it up a bit.  We added a full tablespoon of vanilla and a few dashes of cinnimon.  Delicious.  If you love the buttermilk flavor but want to add a little more complexity, try the vanilla and cinnimon.

Broke in new Procter-Silex Belgian Waffle Maker. We doubled the batch which was perfect to use the whole quart of butter milk.  Ten large waffles was the yield..  I can not use syrup but I broke up some pecans from the freezer and I do not miss the sweetness.  I do want to try some different flours to see how it turns out.

Used whole white wheat flour today and we really enjoyed it.  Needed a little extra buttermilk.  Have also used oat flour(Quaker Oates in the Vita mix), this version needs a least one cup of AP, white, or spelt flour to crisp up for a double batch.  You also may want to cook longer.  I had to flip the waffle to crisp up when using oat flour.  Straight oat flour would not crisp up enough.  Straight spelt flour was nice fresh but dry left over.  We always double the recipe for left overs.  Best to reheat in the waffle maker.  LET THE BATTER SIT FOR 10-15 MINUTES WHEN USING WHOLE GRAINS. It will soak up the liquids better.

So I was looking for the absolute easiest recipe that looked yummy. This was tender. This was easy. The only thing I changed was the recipe calls for low fat buttermilk and I don't low fat anything, especially if butter is involved. Yes, I burned the first pour but it was my first attempt with my Nordic ware waffler and I didn't trust my instinct/nose. Luckily, the batch yields 6 servings so the second pour (4 more waffles) came out perfect. (Kept a closer eye and trusted my nose.) I am so happy. I love buttermilk waffles and so does my special someone so now I get to add this to things I won't burn.

Easy and yummy! Had leftover buttermilk, so I figured, make waffles!
Followed the recipe exact. They came out perfect! Made them on waffle plates on my Forman Grill. Smelled so good! Made 8 waffles. My boy's loved them. Will definitely make again.

Great way to use kefir. Super easy and took 2 minutes each in the waffle iron.  Maybe other waffle recipes are richer but they take about twice as long to cook.  I whipped a double batch up and fed a family of 9 with minimal time standing in front of the waffle iron. Added a little more sugar and doubled the vanilla.

I have to admit that these waffles turned out perfectly, whether you like them softer or crispy. Doubled the recipe for four people allowed for no leftovers in my house!

Love this recipie! We make it all the time. It's light and fluffy, quick and easy. I don't usually have buttermilk handy, so I curdle my milk by adding 2 Tablespoons of vinegar to the 2 cups of milk.

Maybe I am the absolute worst cook ever. (But, I do have my successes.) I followed the recipe, and the batter was far too heavy even though I minimized the blending. I lightened the batter with some additional buttermilk. Still, I found the resulting waffles to be dense and exceptionally flavorless. However, most other reviewers seemed to be absolutely thrilled with their results and I defer to their skills and opinions. I am disappointed I ended up in the ditch on this one. 

I’ll show myself out.

We loved this; it was as described, extra crispy outside & tender inside! I also wanted a waffle recipe where it  wasn't necessary to separate and whip eggs. It is an easy and delicious waffle recipe. The only change I made was to use regular milk with added lemon juice to make the "buttermilk."

These are very easy to whip up 5 star there.  My batter was a little thick, probably from the buttermilk.  I did use whole natural buttermilk : ))They are extremely LIGHT and fluffy with crisp exterior- Texture is So perfect!  Yummy!!  I will make them again for sure!!

Great recipe. I used cultured buttermilk which was not low-fat so I reduced the butter a tiny bit.The mixture was quite thick and lumpy but the waffles were lovely. I halved the recipe for two of us and it made four waffles in the Breville maker.

I think this waffle recipe might be my favorite. I doubled the recipe and the only thing I changed was I doubled the vanilla and added it to the melted margarine as opposed to at the end.

My husband and I  made these this morning and we added blueberry syrup to them which made them taste wonderful!   We did follow the recommendation of placing them on a wire rack in the oven to keep them warm and crispy. It worked great. My husband even said they tasted a bit like a funnel cake!!

Made it just the way the recipe called for with the exception that I added the vanilla to the other wet ingredients before mixing in the dry.  Very easy, delicious and came out crispy on the outside and tender inside once I adjusted the heat on my waffle iron :)

4 1/2 stars for me.   I like my waffles slightly less dense….but these were really good and easy to make.   I saved them to my recipe box and will definitely make them again!

Very bland.  Never got them to crisp up.  They were very spongy.  Even cooked them twice as long as my waffle iron said.

I loved it. Family loved it! I substituted 1 cup flower with stone ground whole wheat flour. Plus, for the extra touch of light and crispy, I whipped up the egg whites, which added a couple of minutes. Very delightful indeed!

Truly tasty and easy waffles! I just made them following the recipe without variation. They were golden and tender, and the flavor was perfect. Though I generally prefer to eat waffles after pouring a bit of maple syrup in each hollow, the little crispy bits in between the waffles were scrumptious all on their own.

Love this waffle recipe! I made just a couple of very minor modifications: I whipped the egg whites before adding them to the buttermilk mixture, plus I added about 1/2 tsp of ground nutmeg - gives it a nice flavor. Yum!

I converted this recipe to gluten free. I subbed 280 GM gluten free all purpose flour for the regular flour & did not add any gum. All I can say is wow!!! These were the best waffles EVER even from what I can remember eating before I was diagnosed with celiac. They were a snap to whisk together & they were so light & airy yet crispy on the outside. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Excellent!  Crisp outside...done inside!
The tip to pour batter just to within 1/2” of edge was perfect!  After all these years I made a waffle not too big or too small!

Best waffles I've made so far. I make my own cultured buttermilk with milk and lemon juice which makes for an easy recipe. Topped with apple-cranberry compote.

This is a great recipe. For me I used the 6 to get them crispy. I used doubled the vanilla extract as 1 tsp isnt enough to taste the vanilla flavor I like. If you double the recipe you will have enough for 6 people with 2 whole waffles a piece. I used dehydrated buttermilk with no texture issues.

This is my go-to recipe if I don't have buttermilk on hand. I whip the egg whites separate, and then tuck them into the batter. Makes for SUPER fluffy panckaes. That with a 1/4 tsp of vanilla, perfect breakfast!

I made them as written, no changes but to add mini chocolate chips. The first batch was too dark (my waffle iron only has one setting) but still tended inside. I think they will be even better heated up in the toaster tomorrow!

Made these waffles for my kids. Batter was very runny and the don't puff up.  The reference to being able to put these in the toaster should have been my first clue. I recommend adding another cup of flower to the batter to get them to fluff.  Taste is a little buttery if you like that. If not cut back on the butter. Kids ate it and didn't complain but they were very thin.

These were very nice. My batter was a little thick and lumpy so I added a splash of regular milk. Flour packs differently so it’s hard to judge by cup. They were crispy outside and tender inside as advertised. We always eat them hot off the waffle iron so no complaints about them getting soggy, which some of the extra ones did a bit on the plate. Should use a rack maybe. Delicious with sweetened sliced fresh peaches. Buttermilk really puffs up nicely so I was happy to find this recipe.

Altered the recipe as follows: 1/4 cup of melted butter, 1 cup low fat buttermilk (a splash of extra to thin batter to desired consistency after all ingredients have been mixed together),  1 cup low fat milk. Baked the batter in my Belgian Waffle Iron and watched my family devour them. NO LEFTOVERS!

Really good. I used a couple tablespoons of vinegar with whole milk to make the buttermilk. I made the waffles in my Dash mini waffle maker. It's the first time I used it and I'm so pleased! It makes the cutest little waffles like Eggos. I think next time I might put a little less vanilla in the batter.

Makes the perfect texture for waffles. Crisp on the outside and soft in the middle. I was out of butter and used coconut oil and they were still delish!

Sooo good! 
We have tried several different waffle recipes and this is by far the best. I edited the recipe a little based on previous reviews by adding 2 tsp vanilla extract and 1/2 tsp almond extract. I also used regular buttermilk and added the extract to the egg mixture before combining with the buttermilk instead of at the end. The batter will be lumpy but the waffles looked amazing and tasted great! I am bookmarking this recipe!

Rave reviews from three generations! I doubled the recipe and did a  generous free pour on the vanilla. I also did a bonehead move and added the eggs to the buttermilk before the melted butter. They still turned out awesome.   They smelled SO yummy when they were on the iron.  I will definitely make these again and again!

Thanks to all of you review-writers who made and commented on the exact recipe. These are very fine, basic waffles. I found them to be a bit bland, which is the only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5. I offered them at breakfast with cooked-down fresh strawberries, whipped cream and maple syrup. These waffles held up very well under the toppings)) and everyone liked them.

I usually find need to adjust a recipe. These are perfect as is. Creates a slight crust on the outside, tender and airy on the inside. Buttermilk is the key as well as mixing lightly by hand so that the batter is not overworked.

I halved the recipe to try it.  That produced six waffles, which is plenty. My five year old niece helped me.  It was simple, easy to do with kids, and made light and tasty buttermilk waffles. Will add this to the cookbook for the future.

wow! these are really great! I had a waffle iron many years ago & wound up getting rid of it because the waffle deliciousness to effort ratio was way off.  Got a waffle iron as a gift & had leftover buttermilk so i gave this a go & holy smokes- these will def make me bust out my waffle iron a lot more often now! So, SO pleased! thank you empebi!

Made the recipe exactly as is with a few small changes, I put the vanilla in with the buttermilk and butter and brought the wet ingredients to room temperature before adding the butter.  A key step in almost any baking.

My whole family enjoyed these.  We used 1 T white vinegar for each cup of cow's milk to make "buttermilk" and added blueberries.  Also, we separated the eggs, beating whites and folding them into the batter.  1.5 batches made 17.5 2"x2" waffles.  Thanks for the tasty recipe.  **When making this recipe a second time, not separating the eggs, the waffles were still delicious but the batter was thinner and waffles were less crisp.  The single batch made 10.5 waffles.  In the future, we'll separate eggs.

I rarely make waffles as my old recipe involved making a meringue and I am just not up to that most Sunday mornings.  I needed to use up some buttermilk which led to me finding this recipe and it's easy method sold me on trying it.  So glad I did.  I followed the recipe exactly and got a nice, thick batter.  For the ease of making, I've never had a better waffle.  The texture was spot on for me, light, crisp with just a bit of chew.  A great pallet for strawberries and whip cream or maple syrup.  Thank you for sharing this recipe, it's put waffles back on the menu.

Added a teaspoon of vanilla extract and a teaspoon of cinnamon to spice it up a bit.  The waffles came out just fine.  I will make them again.

The recipe was really good. We took some suggestions and added the cinnamon with a little extra vanilla. It gave the waffles a nice flavour.

1) This recipe is perfect for half-quantities
2) it flowed very well into the waffle maker
3) easy to add 'included' ingredients such as blueberries and chocolate chips

Any recipe that I do I make small changes to it, I added 1 tbsp more of butter and 2 tsp of vanilla.  I would normally add either cinnamon and brown sugar to swirl into the mix.

I only had half the buttermilk, so substituted whole milk. I used half whole wheat flour. They turned out crisp and great tasting. Oh, and I am trying to use up my huge bag of powdered sugar, so used that, which reduced the sweetness.

Very easy to make and they tasted good. Folding in egg whites makes my usual recipe lighter and fluffier so these were a bit heavy but perfect with a strawberry compote on top. I was able to make 11 waffles.

Delicious! Make more than you think you need. I set the serving for two and it made two waffles which was perfect but they didn’t reach the edges of the waffle iron so they were small. Next time I’ll do 4 for 2 people. Nothing wrong with left overs :)

Loved it. The texture was fluffy and tender. We started just quadrupling the dry ingredients and keeping it in an air tight container so all we have to do in the morning is add the wet ingredients for every two cups dry.  Sometimes we add a little cinnamon or pumpkin spice to the batter when we feel like it and that’s always delicious as well.

I used my Belgian waffle maker for these. Made them for company and they were a hit! I added a little cinnamon, and used my home made vanilla. I saved this recipe and will use it again.

I have made this recipe dozens of times and follow it to the letter.  Recently, my niece, who is a trained chef, tried them and told me they were the best waffles she’s ever had!  That to me is the highest compliment I could receive.
My entire family loves them with strawberries and powdered   sugar on top.

I had buttermilk leftover from soaking fish so I figured I’d give it a try for the kids. The batter was really thick. I’m guessing I mixed something incorrectly so when I put the batter in waffle maker, it overflowed. After the 3rd time I put batter in maker, it finally came out perfectly. Kids loved every bite. I probably won’t make this kind again since I don’t ever buy buttermilk but it’s a good recipe

This is the easiest and best waffle recipe ever!!! I used to use a waffle recipe where you had to fold in the egg whites. That was unnecessary labor! This recipe is straight to the point. I make as is and my family loves it. I usually serve with fried chicken on top drizzled with warm syrup! Definitely a staple in our family!!

The waffles were super easy and fun to make. Although when I followed the recipe it made the batter a little bit doughy so I just added normal milk. Also when you are done with the batter you can add something else inside it... for example i der mashed up bananas

These were VERY good... and easy like the recipe says. However, I wouldnt consider this to be 6 servings. Maybe 4. (I do have big eaters!) This makes 4 cups of batter, which -in my waffle iron- makes only 2 batches of waffles (2 cups/batch = 4 smallish waffles/batch). Will definitely make again...next time I will double!

Very good waffles.  As other reviewers have noted, they are crisp on the outside and have a tender, melt in your mouth texture inside.  I increased the  sugar to 3 TBP and the vanilla to 2 tsp but the taste was still just a little bland which is why I gave them 4 stars. Some tips: Make sure you bring your buttermilk and eggs to room temperature (15 minutes on the counter top for eggs and you can cheat with the buttermilk-about 2 min in the micro on power level 2).  Watch these carefully on your waffle iron.  They brown quickly.

I separatee the eggs and whipped the whites with a touch of cream of tarter, then I lightly folded into the batter at the end. I used Cup-4-Cup gluten free flour in place of regular flour.  These are spectacular!!

I have to add about 1/4 cup of liquid (water) to make it less thick for my waffle maker. Otherwise pretty good waffles!

Made these to have breakfast for dinner one night. I used whole buttermilk instead of low fat cuz that's what we had. The batter turned out a little thick so I was concerned that they were going to turn out too dense, BUT they were delicious and everything you would expect from a waffle! This is definitely my go to waffle recipe now. We even added some berries and chocolate chips to some for a variety. YUM!

I made this last night. I added 2 more tbsp of sugar.  I really like a crisper waffle.  I won't need to search for a good waffle recipe anymore because I found this one.  It is definitely a keeper!!  Thanks for the great recipe!!

The waffles were VERY LIGHT and FLUFFY!!!  Only ingredient change that I made was that I used whole buttermilk.  I don't like low fat buttermilk.
I will make these again.

Had buttermilk in the frig that was about to expire.  Felt like waffles for supper so went online looking for buttermilk waffles.  Very impressed.  Just followed the recipe and they turned out perfect and satisfied my craving.

I have to say these are fantastic!!!!  The only thing I added to my dry ingredients was 2 tbsp ground flax seed. You couldn't tell that it was in there. I just wanted to add it to make a little healthy.  My son really liked them and they're so much better than boxed mix. You can control what you put in them. And it's ingredients that you already have in your pantry. This is my go to recipe !!!!

As written, this is a 3 star. The batter is much to dry with the recipe as written. I added another half cup of regular milk to get it to a reasonable consistency. These waffles did have great texture and definitely tasted better than a box waffle mix. However, like another reviewer said, the flavor could be upped. Next time I will add 3/4 tsp salt and 2 tsp of vanilla. And possible a little more sugar.

Best tasting waffles I have ever had & my family loved them too.   I used honey in place of the white sugar.  I sifted the dry ingredients.  I used two jumbo eggs & an extra 1/2 tsp of vanilla & this made the batter really rich. I used olive oil on the waffle iron & this kept the waffles from browning too much.

This recipe is delicious! I surprised my husband with this fun little waffle maker and knew I had to find a recipe to do it justice. I had never made waffles before, let alone from a recipe from scratch and not something from a box. After reading through several complicated recipes I almost gave up, but then I came across this one and man was it a winner!! The directions are easy enough to follow, just read through them thoroughly before jumping in. The waffles turn out the perfect ratio of light and fluffy on the inside, crunchy on the outside. I didn’t change a thing and they are stupid good! (And yes, in case you were wondering, that’s no moon, it’s a space station!)

This is a good basic recipe--I made buttermilk by adding 2 TBS of vinegar to a cup of milk and let it "sour" for a few minutes before adding it to the egg and butter mixture. If you increase the amount of baking powder to 1 TBS, the waffles come out fluffier. If you use only a teaspoon, the consistency tends to be more condensed and thick. You can use this recipe for pancakes as well!

I thought I was incapable of making crispy waffles my entire life.  I thought my cheap waffle maker was to blame.  Nope!  I just needed this recipe.  

I like to make the following tweak: double the vanilla, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper

By far the best from scratch waffles we've tried!  Major plus, no whisking egg whites to add in at the end. Saves time but doesn't compromise taste and fluffiness of the waffles. Followed recipe as stated. Yummy!

This will be my only waffle recipe. These were light and wonderful. I will be making up the dry ingredients mixed to save some extra time.

I made some adjustments to this recipe:
-Used half whole wheat flour and half all-purpose flour
-Batter was thin because of the 1:1 ratio of flour to milk. I added an extra 1/2 cup of AP flour  to thicken it to my liking.
-I added 6 tbs of sugar because I don't like my waffles bland
Next time I'd use more vanilla (2 tsp or 1 tbs) and add some cinnamon.
I loved how crispy these waffles came out. They tasted delicious with blueberries on top!

A perfect basic waffle recipe without changing a thing!  Light, crisp outside while still tender and moist inside.  My whole family loves them!

We will definitely make these waffles again! We didn't have any Buttermilk so we used Plain, Unsweetened Kefir and that worked great! I love these waffles.  They are great for a Saturday or Sunday breakfast.

These are very good waffles, and the only reason I gave them a "4" rating is because they just don't beat my mom's recipe for Crispy, Buttery Waffles. None I've ever eaten have!!  However, her recipe involves separating the eggs, then folding in stiff beaten egg whites at the end, and I just didn't want to go to that much trouble as I was making waffles to test them out on my new waffle iron.  Also, I wasn't crazy about the addition of vanilla - they were still good, but I don't  associate that taste with waffles.  All in all, really a very good recipe.

This recipe is such a an easy no fuss waffle batter! However, like some reviews mentioned it was a bit bland, I  added an extra 2  tablespoons of sugar and 1-2 tsp of cinnamon.  Turned out perfect! leave it cooking for a little longer to crisp it up!

These are the best waffles I have ever eaten. The outside is able to achieve the level of crispy I prefer while the inside remains tender and fluffy.

Perfect light fluffy waffles. I followed the directions exactly and they turned out great. My MIL brought some coconut syrup back from Hawaii so my husband requested waffles for Sunday brunch. This will be my go to recipe now.

Like many people on here, I made the batter and it came out really thin. I added another cup of flour and that fixed it. It was very good.

I always double this and freeze for the kids. I let them cool on a wire rack so they don't steam themselves and get soggy, then I put freezer paper in between each so they don't stick together in the freezer. I defrost for 20 seconds in the microwave then throw them under the broiler for 2 minutes each side on low to get crispy

I've made this 2-3 times, using white vinegar + milk as a buttermilk substitute. And it's OK... But not great. Even added vanilla last time. Kind of bland, looking for a different recipe.

Awesome! No fussing with separating eggs, and just as good if not better in my opinion! I curdle my milk with lemon juice (1 TBSP per cup of milk).

I reduced the recipe to 3 servings which makes enough for 2 waffles. I forgot the vanilla in the first waffle so I added the full amount to the remaining batter for the second waffle. Both waffles, with and without vanilla, tasted good. Also only used half of the salt.

This was my first waffle recipe and my first time using my Belgian waffle maker, which I found the waffle mixture/batter quite easy to measure and pour.  I also added in a few pinches of cinnamon, a few pinches of sugar, and an extra teaspoon and a half of vanilla extract.  The waffles themselves were tender but plain, which for me, I would have liked them just a little sweeter. My daughter made a face after trying one and said she didn't like the waffles.  But we paired the waffles with the (too sweet for me) IHOP strawberry syrup and they tasted wonderful!  Next time I will try to add in more sugar and (no syrup for me) fruits to enjoy the waffles with.

I made it exactly as written - We cooked them in both a deep Belguim-style waffle maker and a regular waffle maker.  We served them with strawberries, raspberries and bananas.  It was delicious both ways.  Thanks.

Made these for my family this morning and they were devoured by all. I always try to make healthier changes to recipes. I used half whole wheat flour, coconut sugar and Unsweetened apple sauce in place of the butter. They cooked up nicely. Next time I will double the vanilla and separate egg whites folding them in at end. I swear by this method to make them fluffier

These were very fluffy delicious waffles. Best waffle recipe I've ever used. I forgot to add the vanilla until after my first batch, so it was a higher density flavor for the remaining batches, but I really liked it. So I think I'd increase the vanilla in the future. Also make sure to temper the melted butter as you add it to the buttermilk, my melted butter seized up when that cold buttermilk hit it. Also, if you leave the batter sitting, it gets pretty thick, so just make sure you stir it up before pouring it on your waffle iron if it's been sitting on the counter for a few minutes. I didn't do that on my first batch, and they fluffed so huge that my waffle iron couldn't shut all the way!!! Haha.

Made this exactly as written.  Waffles could use a little more flavor, so next time I will use brown sugar instead of white.

Very good and relatively easy.
I tried other recipes and commercial mixes, and this is much better.
I used regular buttermilk, a 'heaping' teaspoon of vanilla, and a teaspoon of salt because I use Steen's Cane Syrup, which is basically liquid sugar.:)
I bought an Oster flip waffle maker at a local box store for $40, it works great.
Already paid for itself with the savings from buying Belgian waffles at our local restaurant.
This will be my preferred waffle recipe.

Ive made this recipe a few times now. Today I made one change I substituted 1/4 cup wholewheat flour which made the waffles a bit more filling I think. (I still managed to eat half the produced goods!) 
My only gripe is I have a little aftertaste from the baking soda, its a bit dry at the back of my teeth sort of feeling.  Next time I'll just use 1tsp. 
Otherwise delicious, light and fluffy, quick to make and lots of leftovers to reheat or freeze yay!

Was looking for an easy, basic buttermilk waffle recipe and this was it! Used real butter, farm fresh eggs, sea salt, and a little extra vanilla. Broke in my brand new George Foreman Evolve grill system with this recipe. Turned out perfectly! Browned and lightly crunchy on the outside, moist and chewy on the inside. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

It was good but I found it somewhat bland, so I added about a tsp of cinnamon, some nutmeg and about a tbs of vanilla. The 1st batch I made came out flavorless and thin. I realized it was because I used a hand mixer instead of mixing it by hand. The 2nd batch was much better, came out crispy and good after I hand mixed it and let it sit for at least 10 mins.

Pleasantly surprised with this recipe. My other recipe is so time consuming as it involves beating egg whites, then the yolks and folding in all ingredients. Using only a whisk and not having to use my stand or hand mixer was nice! So I halved this recipe since it's just me and hubby. But I took the advice of one reviewer who up'd the vanilla and added some cinnamon. I added just a dash of cinnamon and kept the full amount of vanilla. The waffles were crispy and tender, not whimpy like some waffles I've made.  As for the rest of the ingredients, I used King Arthur AP flour and full fat buttermilk. I also used President butter and Madagascar vanilla.

My family loved these waffles. They are crispy on the outside and light and tender inside. I'm not a huge waffle lover because I do not like the heavy, bloated feeling of a lump of bread sitting in my esophagus waiting to drop into my stomach. These were awesome with some Maple syrup and real butter.

These were such a hit at my house my husband bought me a new waffle maker so I could make more at one time. They are light and fluffy and excellent.  One suggestion, use real buttermilk.  It makes all the difference in this recipe. Powdered buttermilk is not a good substitution for the real thing.

Super fluffly! I used half buttermilk and half sour milk because I had to use up my sour milk, and only used a quarter cup of butter since that's all I had.

These waffles were very light but for me they never crisped up. I don't know if it is my waffle maker or the recipe (never had a problem with the maker before) but they were so soft they wouldn't hold shape and never got golden brown - even if I left them on the iron for 7 minutes or more. Sorry.

Because this had the same basic ingredients as my Mom's recipe with the exception of melted butter, and being a butter lover, I decided to try it and made it exactly as written.  My hubby and I both deemed them just ok and a tad heavy.  Trying to mix melted butter with other wet ingredients that are cool resulted in clumps of butter left in the batter bowl instead of in the batter where it belonged.  Turns out my Mom knew best!

These were amazing! They came out extra super mega fluffy.
I did add quite a bit more sugar, and quite a bit more vanilla. I taste tested the batter after following the recipe exactly, and it just tasted very bland. After adding more sugar and more vanilla, they were perfect.  
I always eat my waffles with powdered sugar. My son tried them with powdered sugar and syrup (separate waffles, not together), he said they were better with powdered sugar.
They will be my go to waffle recipe from now on when I have buttermilk on hand. My usual recipe will be the backup now, for days when I don't have any buttermilk in the fridge.

This does make very good waffles and my family really enjoyed them.  The only down side was warming up the leftovers. I put them in the oven to get them warm and crisp but they never really got crisp. I was afraid they would dry out if I left them in too long. Do try this recipe, though!

I made waffles for the first time today with this recipe on my antique cast-iron waffle maker.  It was a huge hit with my family and they insisted that I save it to my recipe box so that I could reference it again in the future.  My husband and kids insist that they are the best waffles ever, and it is definitely my favorite.

I did not make any changes to this recipe, the only thing I did was remove my old waffle recipe and replaced with this one! This is the best tasting, moist on the inside, crispy on the outside waffle I have eaten. The leftovers heated nicely in the toaster and were excellent with peanut butter, great for grab and go breakfast .

However, it is not as yummy as when the eggs are separated and the whites beaten, and then folded into the mix before baking in the waffle iron.  The extra work yields extra texture and flavor.  But this recipe creates a solid and reliable waffle that kids and family will enjoy.

These were great waffles! They were very  light and fluffy as compared to many other waffles. This recipe makes a lot of waffles. The proportions were excellent. I made some following the recipe exactly. Then I added cinnamon to some of the batter and finally cinnamon and blueberries to the rest. They're great with blueberries and/or cinnamon, too. I made my own buttermilk by adding one tablespoon of vinegar to each cup of milk. The first time that I made the waffles I cut the recipe in half. There were enough waffles for 2-4 people (depending on side dishes). They're good reheated as well.  I will make them again.

At the time we could only find one pint (one cup) of Buttermilk from the store so I substituted one cup of regular whole milk for the additional cup. This provided the best combination and turned out to be the best ever waffles yet.
We also used real Mexican vanilla.

These turned out light and fluffy.  Super easy to make using milk that had been soured with lemon juice.  I added cinnamon and nutmeg (personal flavour preference).

I doubled the recipe and added 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Plenty left to freeze and heat up later in the toaster. Family comment "These taste like they were made at a restaurant."

We just got a Belgian Waffle Iron and have been experimenting with various recipes.  I made these this morning and my husband and I loved them.  I made a few adjustments to the flour. Instead of using just all purpose flour I substituted 1/8 cup of all the following: rice flour and oat flour (that I made in my vita mix from uncooked jasmine rice and uncooked oats) and white wheat flour.  I put all those in my 1 cup measure and filled it to the top with the amount of all purpose to equal the second cup.  I think these gave the waffles more flavor and added to their crispness which we like.  I also cut the sugar by half.  This recipe made 10 waffles.  We ate half and refrigerated the rest to warm in the toaster another day.

Been making that recipe for many years from my mothers Betty Crocker Cook Book dated 1961; on the GE waffle maker she got with green stamps.  They suggest using 2 TBSP vegetable oil, lard or bacon grease in lieu of butter if you like.  Nothing like 'made in USA' quality, eh?  Great recipe!

We added a 1 Tbsp of vanilla + a few shakes  of cinnamon @ 1/2 tsp.  NOTE: if  I don't have buttermilk handy, I sour my milk by adding @ 2 Tbsp of  apple cider vinegar before I measure the 2 cups of milk, and let it set in a stainless steel bowl @10 minutes before mixing the rest of the ingredients.

Good recipe...and if you add 1/2 to 1 tsp. ground cardamom to it, you will have essentially Norwegian waffles.  We ( I am Norwegian) don't tend to use syrup on them--we butter them and sprinkle with cinnamon sugar.  Skål!!!!!

We were happy with these.  They do not need additional sugar.  They were relatively fast to make; it was nice not having to separate eggs.  I think we ended up with about 8 waffles.  The only negative thing I noticed is they were the opposite of crispy, if you prefer crispy to soft waffles, even though I cooked them pretty well through.

Excellent quick recipe.  Not as crispy on outside at first but fine after warming on bakers rack as suggested.  Delicious with blueberry compote on top or with chocolate chips  mixed in.

I used milk/lemon juice to sub for buttermilk, 1 TBLS vanilla instead of 1tsp and doubled the sugar. They were pretty good, they definitely would have been bland of I i hadn't made those changes. Not fabulous, probably won't make again

After many years of using a mediocre recipe because it was easier than beating egg whites and folding in, I decided to try this recipe as I had half of quart of buttermilk I wanted to use. Loved this recipe and it is now the new standard in my house, I wouldn't change a thing but may try it using 1 cup of whole wheat flour with the white.

the base recipe is perfect!! I Did add 1 tablespoon of cinnamon and upped vanilla to 1 tablespoon for added flavor! They came out delicious!!! I also had just a handful of chocolate chips so with half the batter I added chocolate chips! My son loved them!! Will definitely make again!

Tender and easy is right.   Just need to add delicious!  This recipe is so much easier than the recipe in Joy of Cooking that requires foling in beaten egg whites.  

Instead of 1/3 cup butter, I used 1/6 cup butter and 1/6 cup oil. They were perfect.  Made 6 - 8" round waffles.

After trying many recipes,  this one is a keeper.   I end up souring milk, since I don't keep buttermilk on hand.   It works well and they bake up light and fluffy.  I usually add a few tablespoons of cornmeal for the crunch.

First time  making waffles.  They came out great.  Fluffy, slightly crisp on the outside and tender on the inside.  I used whole wheat white flour since that's all I had and combo of "soured" whole milk and light almond milk.  Again, all I had.  If you're like me and like 'em without syrup,  it's a bit bland.  However,  the kids enjoyed them with syrup and chocolate chips,  so it's a win. Will definitely be making this again with a little added stevia and maybe half AP and half whole wheat white flour. Thanks for this super versatile recipe!

I have a belgian waffle recipe I use but it requires both milk and buttermilk and I realized my regular milk was expired. I did a search for buttermilk waffles and came across this recipe. I made them exactly as instructed and had fabulous results. Great texture, great flavor...this is the only waffle recipe I will use from now on!

We've made these probably 10 times now and love them!!  This is a great recipe as is (I top them with peanut butter and maple syrup) or as a base for getting creative.  The boys have added bacon and sriracha for a savory waffle -- yummy!

I doubled the recipe and put finely chopped ham and grated cheese in one bowl.  In the other one I used blueberries.  These waffles freeze really well and saved so much time when we just wanted a few waffles for a snack or quick breakfast.  They are great when re-heated in a toaster.

Subbed 2 cups Unsweetened Vanilla Almond milk + 3 tbsp lemon juice for the buttermilk and used a gluten free ap blend in place of the wheat flour because I am gluten and dairy free.  These waffles were enjoyed by every member of the family.  I will be making this recipe again and again, thanks for sharing!

The search is over!  Finally a pancake waffle recipe that is Not from a mix, is not too involved and has a crispy outside (for waffles) with a tender inside.  I make waffles or pancakes about 3x's a week and this one is a keeper.   Only downfall, keeping buttermilk on hand but even if it goes a little sour it is not noticeable in the final product. :)

Easy and great recipe! I didn't have vanilla extract but they were still plenty flavorful. Very moist or crispy depending on how long u cook them for in the waffle iron. My family loved them!  This is my new go to recipe for waffles!!

I LOVE this recipe!! I was having a family brunch & forget to but the waffle mix, I did a Google search and this recipe came up first. I was so happy at the results, my waffles were the star of the meal!! This is a perfect waffle batter base to create wonderful varieties for my brunch I served dark chocolate waffles, buttermilk & blueberry lemon!! You won't go wrong with this one.

I used half whole wheat flour and added blueberries, and it was delicious.  Easy, yummy recipe, and I appreciate that I didn't have to whip the egg whites in this one.

The waffles were delicate, but they had a noticeable aftertaste of soda and baking powder. And the half a teaspoon of salt was far too much for me, but that's just my taste ;) I might try buttermilk with waffles again, but with beaten whites instead of rising agents - or with just a little baking powder.

Need to whip the egg whites separately in order to get nice fluffy waffles from this recipe.  Even then my waffle maker was unable to cook the waffles all the way through.

I made this recipe because I only had buttermilk. These were pretty good, I did add a little more vanilla, and next time I will add a little more sugar and salt. Otherwise the waffles were fluffy but crisp in the outside.

Best recipe I've tried so far! It was only for myself, so I halfed the ingredients, used 1/2c whole wheat flour & 1/2c flour, and added milk chocolate chips. Overall, it was great and not too sweet!

I have tried a few different waffle recipes. This is my favorite that I come back to ever time. Easy to make and are NOT cakey/dense. Very tender.
