I have made the fruit dip with just marshmellow creme and with cream cheese but this was good.  I like the flavor and it was just too easy to make.  Thanks for posting.

You can make this non-alcoholic by subbing in 2 tablespoons of frozen orange juice concentrate for the schnapps.  It tastes great!

An excellent dip that's loved by everyone. Try substituting the schnapps with 1/4 cup of maraschino juice.  It produces a dip with a pink blush that tastes great too!

My kids and I really liked this. I made this into a "Fuzzy Navel" mallow dipping sauce with 1 1/2 tbsp. orange juice concentrate and 1 1/2 tbsp. peach schnapps. No. Leftovers.

I love this dip. It tastes like cheesecake. I usually serve it with the pepperidge farm bordeaux cookies. Yum!

This was one of the best fruit dips I've ever made....according to my family.  My granddaughter asks for it whenever a special occasion comes up and it's easy enough to make every day if you wanted to.

I like to add about 2 extra tbs. of schnapps. I also mix it up sometimes and use an ameretto instead. Great dip.

I used OJ instead of Peach Schnapps so the kids could eat this. After I mixed this together I thought that it was a little too sweet and thick so I added extra OJ and about 1/2 cup of Plain yogurt to it. It was still very sweet but the yogurt toned the sweetness down a little. Yummy.
