I added a half tsp. of maple flavoring and half tsp. of vanilla. I also used lowfat buttermilk. These baked up nicely but my kids found them a bit dry. Maybe another egg? They smell divine. This is a nice way to use up instant oatmeal, which I happen to always find cheap at my local discount grocery store.

This was a very mouthwatering recipe and it smelled delightful while baking in the oven. Instead of veg. oil I used half a stick of butter. I also baked it as a cake because I didn't have muffin tins but it came out great. Insted of instant oatmeal packets I used oatmeal, brown suger and a little bit of maple suryp.

If you add a second egg, it makes them perfectly light and fluffy! Some people with a sweet tooth may want to add a bit more sugar, but I enjoyed it as is. I had only one packet of oatmeal so I used a half cup of Raisin Bran and it worked great!  I also added blueberrys for fun.

Pretty good muffins...I substituted applesauce for the oil and added a little extra cinnamon to the topping.

This was an easy late nite snack, that was a delicious smack-down on my hunger.  I used what I had on hand, which was cinnamon-plum spiced/flax instant oatmeal.  Additionally, I used Splenda instead of white sugar.  Sure it could use more sugar/sweetener if a cupcake was the goal...but as a muffin...nope, as is...perfect.  Thanks for the share.  :)

Very average, very heavy, gummy muffins.  Despite adding more sugar and vanilla these were disappointing.  I won't make them again and will likely throw the remaining 6 muffins away.  I'll look for some other recipe to use up extra packages of instant oatmeal -- this won't cut it.

Great recipe because it can be changed around to suit your personal needs or taste.  I used the apple/cinnamon packets of lower sugar oatmeal, added 1 tsp. cinnamon,1 tsp. vanilla & 1/3 C. chopped walnuts to the recipe.  I also used non fat milk, part Splenda, part applesauce for some of the oil, part whole wheat flour to make it even healthier. Next time I will try adding Craisins.  These freeze well and are delicious!  Thanks so much for the recipe! It's a keeper!!

I made some of the changes others' suggested (one of my favorite things about allrecipes) - such as adding an additional egg and vanilla. I used brown sugar instead of white and a little more baking powder (1T).  I also added a package of the oatmeal to the streusel topping since I had an extra one, and 2 mashed bananas to the mix. The muffins were light in texture and flavor and had nice high peaks - so they were very appealing in appearance too!

Needs more flavor and sweetness but my kids really loved it and it was fun to make.  Very convenient using packets of oatmeal.  The topping is really good.  It needs at least double the sugar and the addition of vanilla and/or maple and cinnamon.

Definitely add another egg. I did and my muffins didn't come out dense or heavy at all. If you like your muffins on the sweeter side, then you might want to add more sugar. I just threw in about 2 more tbs or so and it was just the right amount of sweetness for me. When I bake and the recipe calls for milk, I use buttermilk instead (made my own - 1 tbs of vinegar + 1 cup of milk). Don't overmix the batter! Happy baking ^_^

Thanks for the recipe, but I found these to be a little gummy. I'm wondering if its the brand of instant oatmeal I used? Anyhow, not sure I will try these again but if I do I will have to make some adjustments. (More maple, vanilla, or something) Thse were just missing something.

Nice to find a recipe that actually CALLS for oatmeal packets. Usually, I just resort to them in a pinch.  Super quick for breakfast and very yummy warm out of the oven.

All in all a good recipe. I followed it exactly as written, except I baked it as a cake instead of as muffins. The topping is good and necessary. Tastes great when it is hot and fresh from the oven. If I make this again, I will try adding some maple and/or vanilla flavoring as other reviewers suggest.

Overall this was a good recipe to use up the oatmeal packets and create something different with them. They came out a little dense for me and needed to be sweeter. Next time I might add some vanilla extract and a little more sugar to sweeten. Other than that these didn't come out too bad!

This was amazing!!! Made as a cake as well. The extra egg is a must. I added a can of peaches I'd cut up, and was out of milk so subbed half cup of the peach syrup and half sweet tea. Added extra brown sugar to topping and cake, as well as extra cinnamon and lots of ginger. Added crushed almonds to topping which was fabulous. If making a cake, will need to cook for a half hour or more. This would be good with apples or any fruit, fresh, canned or dried.

Quick and easy, but bland, despite adding vanilla and more sugar. I used strawberry-vanilla instant oatmeal because that's what I had. I used an extra egg and the texture is great, but I should have put cinnamon in the batter as well as the topping.

This is such a quick and easy recipe to make.  Reading some of the other reviews I was a little concerned with the fact they may be so dry, so I did add the extra egg, 1.5 teaspoons maple extract and used 1/2 cup of sugar.  If you are after a light and fluffy muffin then these are not for you, they certainly more robust but I would not say they were dry.  Next time I plan on making them with some of the other instant oatmeal flavors like cinnamon and apple.  I loved the look of these muffins, nice high peaks like you get from a bakery.

It was a little dense and sticky, I dont know if that contributed from subsituting veg oil with apple sauce? I used apples & cinnamon instant oatmeal. It was very good.

Meh. That's all I can say about these bland, dense muffins. I used regular quick-cook oatmeal and about 2 tsp. of real maple syrup instead of the packets of instant oatmeal. Maybe that made the difference. I won't make these again.

Was looking for a way to use up some of my maple and brown sugar instant oatmeal and found this! Turned out great.  Dried cranberries would be a great addition.  Streusel topping is a must!

I didn't feel like they had any flavor aside from the topping. Very dry too.  I even added the extra egg and teaspoon of vanilla.

I read A LOT of reviews before making these so I added another egg and more sugar to the batter (1/2 c. total.) as suggested by others. Also, I used apple cinnamon instant oatmeal because that is what I had, so I added some cinnamon to the batter as well. No other changes. They are very attractive. They look like something you would get at a bakery and are delicious.  I'm looking forward to trying these with other oatmeal flavors.

I have a surplus of instant oatmeal and wanted other ways to eat it. Other reviews recommended an additional egg , vanilla flavoring and more sugar. I did the 2nd egg, added tsp of vanilla, but I didn't change the sugar. It's still a dense muffin, but I think it's nice! I do see where some would want more sweetness, but I think it will pair nicely with a sweetened hot beverage just the way it is! I think I will give it a go right now...

I substituted Pumpkin Spice Instant Oatmeal and added maple syrup to the topping. They turned out great but a little dry.

I used regular oatmeal, brown sugar, and syrup instead of instant. Also, substituted brown sugar for the regular sugar and added an egg. I would double the streusel topping next time. Turned out great!

These were good for breakfast, not too sweet. I prefer them that way.  I used 2 eggs and a little extra baking powder per others' suggestions.  Also chose not to add the topping so they were pale, but nobody cared.  I did note a slightly gummy texture, but no one cared about that either.

If I hadn't added the oatmeal myself I'd have never known there was any oatmeal in these muffins.  The amount of oatmeal needs to be ratcheted way, way up!

I was looking for a recipe to use up oatmeal packets. I had apple/cinnamon packets so used them but followed the rest of the recipe as written. These were OK but nothing special. I ate them but they are a bit bland. They need a lot more "flavor" for me.

Very good!  I used 2 eggs and substitute the oil for cinnamon applesauce. Also used 3 packets of oatmeal instead of 2 and added some  chopped pecans to streusel

Family liked these, but I modified it based on suggestions of other reviewers.  CHANGES: 1) subbed apple cinnamon applesauce for veg oil 2) used 1/2 cup sugar instead of 1/3 cup 3) added an extra egg 4) added 1/2 tsp vanilla & 1/2 tsp maple flavoring to batter 5) added closer to 1/2 tsp cinnamon to streusel topping. Giving 4 stars because it had to be tweaked, but is probably closer to a 4.5. Next time I might add a little more maple flavoring & some cinnamon to the batter., as it was a little bland for my son ( and me).

Good, basic muffins, but they are a little bland, so I'd add vanilla or maple flavoring next time to the muffin batter itself, and maybe some cinnamon as well.  They are incredibly easy, however, and versatile, I'm sure, so I may make other changes next time with the type of instant oatmeal.  We have tons of the instant oatmeal mix and I almost grabbed the cinnamon roll one since I had a hard time finding the maple brown sugar one initially.  The servings are right on and I had 12 perfectly baked up muffins, but I had to bake an extra 10 minutes.  Thanks for the recipe!

I did not care for this recipe. I applied many of the changes. Even with fresh nutmeg and raisins there was little flavor.

I added more sugar and added vanilla. I still felt it needed to be a bit sweeter. It also needed 5 minutes longer in the oven.

These were pretty good! They were pretty dense and I think it might be because I substituted applesauce for the oil. Will probably make again but it won't become a regular.

These were quick and easy and tasted great! I used soy or almond milk because of lactose intolerance. Super!! :o)
