The only changes I made to this recipe were as follows: when I cooked the chicken, I cooked it with a pack of fajita mix and instead of black olives, I used black beans.  Also, topped it with Mexican white cheese when it came out of the oven.

Amazingly yummy burritos!  Received many compliments!

I was surprised that I really liked this dish because I really don't care for Mexican food, but I had a big pack of flour tortillas, so I went shopping for the other items and cooked it up. I used fajita mix on the chicken as another reviewer had done, which was definitely a big flavor booster. I also used Mexican cheese and a red pepper instead of green, and omitted the cilantro since we hate it. I served it with avocado slices that I covered in fresh lime juice - loved it.

Per other suggestions, I subbed with pre-baked chicken dredged in taco seasoning, omitted salsa (to serve with later), pinto beans for olives, Monterrey Jack for cheddar, frozen Hatch Chileâ€™s for green pepper. Even with the changes, I highly rate the recipe because it is so amenable to simple tweaks and personal preferences. And easy-peasy!

As a beginner chef, i would strongly recommend this recipe. It was easy to make and tasted amazing. I personally, am not a big fan of salsa, so I subbed in taco sauce instead. It added a different flavor; I would strongly recommend this to anyone who  doesn't like salsa.

I followed the directions with one exception, I had left over rotisserie chicken breast that I diced and substituted for the fresh chicken.  Amazing! Because rotisserie is already seasoned I eliminated the salt and pepper.

This recipe was a huge success! Not too difficult for a beginner and we had everything on hand. I would have posted a picture but they were gone too fast! Even my little guys loved them!

I love this recipe! I doubled it, with thigh meat, and used half of the meat mixture on tortilla chips with more cheese on top as NACHOS! My teenagers love this!

Delicious and simple to prepare. I did not add the jalapeno to the recipe as I had jalapeno poppers for an appetizer, and omitted the onion. These were very tasty and my entire family loved them!

Really easy to make... I made a version of this recipe but took liberty with what I had on hand. I served it with a dollop of guac and a couple spoonfuls of Mann's Southwest Chipotle Nourish Bowl.

I cooked the chicken with taco seasoning and added mexican style rice right before putting the burritos in the oven.  Double batch is easy to make, leftovers taste delicious.

No cilantro or sour cream. Added some green onion. Loved it. Daughter loved it. Leftovers for lunch. Victory.

I make  these often- I substitute habenero for the jalepeno, add black beans and we love them.
