I had some lemon curd I wanted to mix with mascarpone so I used this recipe as a guideline, but kind of did my own thing... I used half a prepared Entemann's pound cake cut in small cubes, then put raspberries and blackberries on top of that, sprinkle with a teaspoon of Grand Marnier, then the lemon curd/mascarpone mixture, and then repeated the layers, ending with a third layer of cake and berries. Topped with fresh whipped cream :) The Grand Marnier got pretty strong as we got down to the bottom! Next time I would make this the night before. And I put mine in wine glasses instead of jars. Thank you for this great idea :)

I just made these for this weekend's camping family reunion.  I assembled them on-site having prepared the ingredients at home.  They turned out great!  I used the basic recipe and filled 8 cup jars, rather than 4 pint jars.  Everyone loved them.  I wouldn't change a thing, other than shave a little more chocolate than I did!

This was a lot of work but I modified this to work in a large trifle bowl.  I double the ingedients, plus added in 2 batches of homemade whipped cream from this site.  I layered half of the pound cake and few raspberries in the bottom of the bowl and sprinkled with a good amount of the water/lemon juice/sugar mixture.  Then, after mixing the cheese, lemon curd and lemon zest, I added half of the mixture to one batch of whipped cream and layered on top of the cake/raspberries.  I basically did two layers of this, topping with the cream/cheese/curd mixture.  On top, I added some plain whipped cream, the raspberries and chocolate shavings.
The cheese/curd mixture was way too strong if left alone.  It was great when mixed with the whipped cream.

Wow! Now this was an excellent dessert that made a great presentation! It really didn't take a lot of time or effort to create something special that provided a wonderful ending to dinner. To lighten this up a bit, I used angel food cake vs. pound cake along with reduced fat mascarpone cheese (not easy to find I might add). I used a mix of blueberries, raspberries and blackberries (any combination of berries on hand will do) layering everything into over-sized wine glasses and topped it off with light whipped cream. These definitely tasted as good as they looked!

I have not made this recipe, I just found it here and it sounded wonderful so happily looked forward to reading the reviews of those who have.  The problem is, most of the reviewers tell how they modified it, not if it was a good or bad recipe.  Shouldn't there be another section for modification's that made a recipe good or better and leave reviews for actual reviews on the recipe as given?  The reason I gave it 5 stars is because I couldn't submit this without a rating.

This is  delicious. We modified it slightly by using lemon pound cake . We also layered it into  an 8.5 x 11 casserole dish. We split the mascarpone mixture and pound cake into two portions and layered the dessert lasagna style, placing the raspberries and lemon curd as the middle layer. As a final touch we opted for raspberry dark chocolate shavings. Yummy, light and refreshing!

Very good with a sweet sherry but much better than pound cake is a sponge cake (many recipes on this site).    Pound cake tends to be too dense for a trifle of any kind.
