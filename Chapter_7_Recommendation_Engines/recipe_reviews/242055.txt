This is a five star breakfast cereal. A couple of things stand out about method though. I suggest grinding the rice before doing anything. I used coconut oil instead of butter. If you want a quick breakfast, make this the night before, because it takes a while to make and tastes wonderful reheated adding a bit more coconut milk when reheating. Thank you for the recipe.
