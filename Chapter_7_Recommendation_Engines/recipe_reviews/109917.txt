these cookies are awesome.  i found the recipe on this site 2 weeks ago and i've had to make them three times.  i'll be making them again for the family christmas party this weekend.  i only gave it 4 stars cuz they're a bit time consuming and messy (with all the icing sugar) but well worth it.just a quick note to add, i dredged them 4 or 5 at a time when they were still hot.  this melts the icing sugar a bit and makes them a little sticky.  i then dredge them again when warm.  this ensures a generous coating of icing sugar that looks spectacular!

I had 2 cups of leftover peanuts so I subsituted them, finely chopped, for the hazelnuts. The cookies came out great; they had a different flavor but were still just as rich and delicious!

Great cookies! I made only a half batch, and I had to use a bit of extra butter to get them to stick. Might be because I used crushed almonds instead of ground. I will definitely make them again.

These were really good and my family really liked them as a light Christmas cookie. I do find fault with the directions, which is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars. It says to preheat the oven, then it says to chill the dough for an hr. That's an awful long time for an oven to be on. Luckily, I caught that before making them.

This receipe was awesome. Just like my great grandmothers from Vienna Austria. So easy to make. I did roll the biscuit about 4 times to get a great costing of powdered sugar.  I didn't add any salt because the butter I used was a sweet dream salted butter. Absolutely delicious.

They're good, easy to make, but I find them a bit bland on their own. I wonder if granulated sugar would make a difference? Also, I think I would add a little bit more butter next time.

These taste great and are slightly addictive; the whole family loved them. I don't usually go in for powdered sugar treats, but in this case I made an exception. I had to make another batch right away.
