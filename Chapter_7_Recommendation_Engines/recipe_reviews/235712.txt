Very, VERY good! I liked that this used lime juice instead of the usual lemon, and all of the flavors complimented each other well. I didn't bother to dirty the blender making this, I just threw everything into a jar w/ a tight fitting lid and shook the heck out of it...worked like a charm! Very nice and refreshing. I will be making this one again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I would give this 10 stars if I could! Amazing, my whole family loved it. I made the recipe with all the ingredients exactly as written but did not put this in the blender, just put everything in a mason jar (made sure the lid was on tightly!) and shook it for a few seconds until it emulsified. Perfect way to keep the leftovers until tomorrow as well :)

I love this!  It is great made just as written and it also lends itself well to variations.  Today for the lime juice portion I used half fresh lime juice and half fresh  pineapple juice.  I also added half a teaspoon of minced-ginger-from-a-jar and it was divine.

Guys - I have never made salad dressing before. I made this. It is amazing. I cut the recipe in half. Used  a fresh lime (2 tbsp juice/lime) and didn't have canola oil so I used vegetable oil. It's amazing. I made honey and lime zest glaze for chicken to go in the salad with it, and since the salad had berries added 1 blackberry and 4 blueberries after I had already tried the initial flavor. Either way is DELICIOUS.

I love this recipe. I was looking for a fresh dressing to go with my avocado mango salad, and found this to be perfect, especially since I had a bunch of limes on the table. I am always a fan of fresh ingredients, so I used 2 cloves of fresh garlic instead of the garlic powder. I also substituted out the white sugar, so I ended up using about 2 1/2 T honey. I will definitely use this recipe again... especially since my friends have taken most of the leftovers. :)

Loved this!  Great over avocado and grilled chicken and greens!  I am not a fan of canola oil, so I substituted 1/2 the amount it called for with garlic evoo.  Didn't measure the salt, pepper, cumin - just tasted as I went and shook it up in a mason jar.  YUM!  ALSO, I didn't add the sugar.  The honey was sweet enough for my taste!

I amped up the lime juice a bit since I hand squeezed and had a bit extra so I also added about another tablespoon of honey. Threw everything into a jar and used my immersion blender to create the emulsion.  Used it to dress a salad with Napa cabbage, red leaf lettuce,shaved fennel, red onion, red mangoes and navel oranges. After each person dressed their salad we sprinkled a little Tagin Classico on top as well. It was divine!

This is a very fine dressing but you won't need the white sugar. Other than that, I used all other ingredients except I used real garlic in the processor.

I made this for my culinary class and had to change it a little but it turned out wonderful with a few tweaks to the recipe. I had no honey so used light karo for the sweetness and added a splash red wine vinegar too.

Definitely 5 stars for taste and a simple clean recipe that can be tweaked to suit.  No added white sugar for my batch, just upped the honey to taste; and cut down the oil by half.  This dressing tastes much, much better the day after making.  The flavors smooth out and blend together.  It's delicious!

3.7.19  Mixed this up in my mini chopper that came with my immersion blender.  Just a really good combo of ingredients with a good balance of sweet-tart.  That lime juice definitely screams citrus flavor, and the cumin and dijon mustard enhance it well.  Just an FYI, if you're worried that it's too liquid-y,  it does slightly thicken after refrigeration.  In the future, I think I’ll stick with all olive oil instead of equal parts canola and olive oils (personal taste preference).  Good stuff, just one little adjustment for me the next time, but this is outstanding vinaigrette!

I thought this was very good.  I served it over romaine, blackberries, candied almonds and feta.  It was good with that combination, but I prefer my homemade Lemon Poppyseed dressing.  I think this flavor would go great over a taco salad or mango and avocado salad.  It was also terrific on our normal dinner salad of romaine, cucumbers, carrots and olives.

I followed the recipe exactly except I didn’t have regular honey so I used buckwheat. Oh my goodness. This is a fantastic dressing. Great summer dressing. Very light lime tasting. Seasonings are perfect. I recommend this dressing for everyone.

I followed this recipe to a T. Could hardly taste the lime and found it quite oily. I did use the blender. I will try it again and use less oil and more lime juice.

Excellent. The cumin adds a nice, unique flavor to it. Had it on salad of spinach, home-grown heirloom tomato, English cucumber, and boiled egg.

Turned out really well. Substituted real garlic rather than powder and vegetable oil rather than canola to make it lighter. It was lovely. Very yummy for summer.

I was so impressed by the balance of tastes in this recipe.  I will definitely make again.  I r gently had a dressing similar to this at my neighbourhood pub but theirs had dill in it.  I may try a dash of that next time.

This is a very good recipe. I was looking for a vinaigrette to put on a green salad that contained mango slices, strawberries, and toasted almonds; this salad dressing was a great match for this combination. I made it up as directed, using my hand blender to mix the ingredients. The only change I made was to omit the white sugar, I figured the 2 tbsp of honey would make it sweet enough, and we liked it just fine. This is a definite keeper, thanks for the recipe, Lisa.

Delicious and simple!  I added ½ grated fresh lime rind, omitted the sugar & honey and used 1Tbsp. Real maple syrup. Served over Grilled Romaine and Asparagus!

Made this today.  Really tasty.  I used Agave instead of honey, 1 pkt Truvia instead of sugar and only used 3 Tab EVOO for 8 servings & NO canola oil.  Def a keeper!

Love love love this dressing. I made it without the cumin since we had run out and it was still very good. A little bit goes a long way and you don't have to worry about any ingredients you can't pronounce.

Love it, added lime zest, used minced real garlic, and no cumin.  Blending seems key - be good for chicken too.

I thought this needs twice as much lime juice as is in the recipe. A little bland.

Exactly the taste I was hoping for.  Delicious on my salad with chicken and mango.  Only change I made (because I don't use canola oil) is that I subbed coconut oil (melted) for the canola oil.  It was delicious!  A keeper!

There was too much Dijon for my taste. I ended up doubling the other ingrediants to compensate. I also was looking for something a little thinner so I added a little water.

Loved this dressing.  Used this on a quinoa salad with sautéed vegetables. It was perfect!
