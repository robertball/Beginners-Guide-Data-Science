I love these! First time I had fried plantains was at Bongos in Downtown Disney (Now referred to as Disney Springs). I found this recipe and have made it several times. I did not tweak anything just followed the directions and they are delicious! Who would have guessed mayo, ketchup and garlic went so well together. I did notice that the plantains cannot be too ripe. If they are they don't seem to crisp up as nice. Enjoy!

I made exactly as written and was torn on how to rate this recipe but am going with a 4. Lets start with the positive shall we? The wasabi dip is absolutely amazing and goes perfectly with these green beans. The french fried onions were also genius IF you can get them to stick to the bean. Even with the double dipping method I was unable to get the onions or the bread crumbs to stick so I just had clumps of it here and there. I think a tempura batter makes a better coating for fresh veggies but then you'd lose out on the french fried onions in this recipe. One other to add and that is I felt the chicken broth got lost and was an unnecessary expense. I think salted water would work just fine. Overall this was a great recipe and one I will make again with some tweaks. If you like cucumbers and wasabi then you have to try this dip!
