Great Recipe.  I added more salsa (1/2 cup) and instead of melting the cheese on the stove, mixed everything and then put it in the oven and let it bake until bubbly. Goes great on sliced baguette bread.

Very simple but it is better doubled and layered!  Spread the cream cheese on the bottom of a 9x13" pan, top with cooked and drained ground, seasoned beef mixed with salsa and top with taco cheese.  Bake until bubbly and cheese is melted.  It will go so quick!

Wow! This was SO good! There were absolutely no leftovers, and I now have another dip to add to my party list! I added salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder to the ground beef, as well as a little extra chili powder. Then I added the salsa (also used about 1/4 cup extra) and let simmer. I then moved it to my tiny crock pot and added the cream cheese, 1/2 cup of mexican blend cheese, and 1/4 block Velveeta. It stayed deliciously warm and cheesy for hours! Served with restaurant style tortilla chips, and it was a hit!

Easy and yummmy. This would make great nachos as well. The recipe is great as is, but we like to add a bit more chili powder, and also cumin. Easy to whip up before game night.

A perfect appetizer recipe ... foolproof and delicious.  You can alter proportions (I did not have quite enough cream cheese and I added more salsa) and it is very forgiving.

I love this Mexican Taco dip, I liked that it is a warm dip and not cold.  I served it with sliced green onions, black olives, and jalape√±o.

Delicious and simple!  I loved the suggestion from another cook who said to layer everything.  So layer is what I did starting with the cream cheese, beef/chili powder then cheese on top, cooked until the cheese was bubbly and my husband, children and I loved it!

OMG this was the BEST.  I made this for work and everyone couldn't keep their hands off of it. I think the only change I did was a bit more seasoning in the beef when cooking it, but overall it was very yummy.  This is a great appetizer!!

I doubled this, used ground turkey (that I had previously cooked and frozen--we had no water for most of the morning, I was thankful I'd pre-cooked batches of ground turkey a month ago), califlornia ground chili powder (for the same flavor but less heat) and reduced fat cream cheese. I threw everything in my small crockpot this morning and let it go until lunchtime. The boys loved it!

Very good dip. I added onion and bell pepper to my beef while cooking used Salsa Verde and green chilies, omitted the sour cream and spread over heated refried black beans topped with shredded cheese and baked til golden brown. Very very tastey, got rave reviews from my classmates

This is a great way to use up leftover taco meat.  I used taco meat with taco seasonings already in it since I had some to use up.  Turned out great.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe leaves a lot of room for variation if you want.  I added corn and chili beans for more substance.  I also forgot the cheese, but it turns out it is delightful even without the cheese.

YUMMY. I used Julio's mild salsa, Neufchatel cheese, and a prepackaged mexican blend of cheeses (queso quesadilla, asadero, and manchego). This was a great dip but would also work well for nachos, taco salad, or tostadas. I served this with tortilla chips and Ritz crackers. The crackers were really good with this!

Awesome dip.  I made for the Superbowl and my family loved it.  My son asked me to make some more this weekend.  Will absolutely make this again and follow the recipe exactly.

This was outstanding! I added it to tortilla chips to create nachoes and served it as an appetizer on Super Bowl Sunday.  I had a ton of compliments and would highly recommend this.  I used a salsa which wasn't chunky and it was a bit runny, still terrific but you should either add more beef if you use a loose salsa or stick to the chunky as the recipe indicates.  Also added light cream cheese to cut some calories -- fantastic!!

I used to make this for my husband quite often in our unhealthier days. I used more cream cheese, and added a can or two of kidney beans as well in the last stages of cooking (just to heat them through). He usually added jalapeno rings to his serving, and preferred to eat them with whole wheat crackers (because it is a very sturdy dip, and tortilla chips are not terribly sturdy!). Thanks for the memory :)

I used neufchatel cream cheese (lighter version) and increased to 1 package.  Made dip a perfect consistency to dip with tortilla chips.  Very hearty and tasty dip.

Mmmm.. I just made this for our 4th of July picnic. My family loved it so much we stood around the stove eating it out of the skillet! When it did get to the table, the dish was empty before any other! I'm making this again for a family reunion in a few weeks!

Very good overall, but a little too sweet because of the cream cheese.
