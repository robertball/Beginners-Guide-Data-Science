A few months ago I made the recipe on this site called Grandma's Date-Nut Bread. It was so good, and I was hoping that this recipe would be similar. While this one was okay, it wasn't what I had hoped for. The only adjustment I made to the recipe was that I used all ap flour, as that is what I had on-hand.
