I had no idea what to expect from this unusual combination of ingredients, but it was really very good! The flavors all complemented each other perfectly, with no one taste dominating--it was neither radishy nor eggy. And I had no problems with heartburn, like a previous reviewer. My boyfriend isn't crazy about radishes, and he really liked this. I'll definitely make it again.

Oh, my hubby just loved this recipe! The eggs were the perfect compliment to this crisp and light radish salad. I did add my usual garlic and onion powders and a sprinkling of Italian seasonings. Thanks!

My mom and I decided to try this recipe, beside the negative review and the 27 that agreed ;)  since she loves radishes in salad, and I'm a big fan of egg in my salad.  We both agreed that it was great and that we would venture to make it again for another lunch date.  Thanks for the recipe!

As a Peace Corps Volunteer, I'm constantly searching for recipes that are healthy, creative, delicious and CHEAP.  This one fit the bill all the way.  When I made it the first time, I loved the color and the freshness, but wasn't thrilled with the taste.  I had the leftovers the next day, however, and that's when it got good.  I think this salad is like pico de gallo or baba ghanoush--you have to let it sit in the fridge for a while so the flavors can meld.

Didn't add black pepper--I think radishes are peppery enough on their own.
Changed the dressing a bit, but that's because I have to conserve my olive oil and because I like things a bit mustardy.

Edible, but not appetizing.  I made this with one less egg than called for, because I wasn't sure how many cups of radish I had.  Turns out I had exactly 4 cups but the eggs had already started to boil by the time I had sliced all the radishes.  I'm glad I only used 3 eggs though, otherwise it would have been way too eggy.    I really wanted to like this, but the dressing made the radishes limp rather quickly, and became watery when the radishes gave up their moisture.  The odor puts me off a bit.  This is a dish that I do not crave, but I'm a weirdo and if I make something I absolutely must finish the whole batch (waste not!).  Once I start eating it the dish is just ok.  Edible, but not enjoyable.  I will not make this again.

I like radishes and I really wanted to like this salad.  I guess I don't like radishes as the main ingredient in a salad, they were just overwhelming.  I was the only one who ate any, the rest of my family wouldn't touch it.  The dressing was good, though.  I may use it for other things.

Too much radish not enough egg. Major heartburn.  The body of this recipe says two stars, but since I am the only one to review it should be one stars.  Will never make this again.  Sounded good, but was not.

Made this with the mint for 4th of July.  My mother loved it.  Refreshing recipe with radish as the main ingredient not just a garnish.

Used fresh mint with this instead of parsley and it was wonderful!

See, this is the sort of thing I just love.  Everything I needed was just magically growing in my garden, waiting to be transformed into this gem of a salad.  The radishes are totally transformed by the parsley and the dressing--it's just genius.  My three year old daughter, a salad connoisseur albeit one who's never liked radishes, loved this salad.  This is so going in my recipe box, and I'll look forward to making it every spring and fall when there are radishes in my garden.

This was very good! Better than I expected, actually. It makes a bucket-load--I should have cut the recipe in half, really, but that's no one's fault but my own. Slicing the radishes was a pain--I recommend getting a helper (if you have one) for that and for pulling the parsley leaves off the stems.

Great recipe! Radishes are very bitter when eaten raw, but somehow the dressing tempers it quite a bit. Mine just had a hint of mustard flavor, and it wasn't salty. The egg adds some smooth texture to the salad. Will definitely make it again!

This was edible, but not very enjoyable. Not crazy about the dressing, which is pretty important. I'll stick to sliced radishes with goat cheese on crusty bread.
