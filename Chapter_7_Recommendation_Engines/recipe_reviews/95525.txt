A friend brought this into work one day and it was so good I made some as soon as I got home! This spread is also great on bagels and crackers. I add a little more orange juice to make it easier to spread.

Wow!  This is really good!  It's easy to mix up and we used this on ritz crackers.  Instead of grating orange peel, I used a few drops of LorAnn orange oil flavoring.  A hit atmy house, thank you for a easy and delicious snack recipe.
