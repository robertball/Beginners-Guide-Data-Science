This was tasty, but definitely needed more seasoning. The ingredients were a bit vague as chicken breasts vary  greatly in size. I used some ground chicken which weighed less than the two chicken breasts i had on hand. I had a lot of filling left over. I would make these again, but I would add extra seasoning, less chicken, and more feta.
