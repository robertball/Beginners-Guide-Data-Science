I changed just a couple of things. I scaled the recipe from 4 to 8 servings. I used 6 red potatoes and realcheeses instead of fat-free cheeses. I also added a little bit of butter. What can I say? It was faboulous. It looked a little goopy but tasted great.

I too added ham to this recipe, as ham and scalloped potatoes are inseperable to me.  This recipe came out very well.  I didn't use all of the flour, more like 2 tablespoons.  I also didn't use all of the onion, as the ham carried the recipe by itself.  Be sure to use red potatoes, as they won't mush like bakers and retain their shape and flavor better in any casserole like this.  One last thing, add quite a bit of pepper, it goes well in this.

The recipe was good, but a little bland. Next time I will use a sharper cheddar.

These paired well with ham, and were over all good.  I boiled the potatoes almost all the way through to ensure proper cooking.  I really liked the addition of the swiss cheese in this.  I do like my potatoes a bit creamier, but overall a good dish.  Thanks TOH.

This was very good. I added some fresh garlic as I put garlic in just about everything. I'm tired of all the recipes that call for canned soup so this was a very pleasant change.

This dish was great with a couple of setbacks. All of my potatoes were not fully cooked after the timer went off, and there was a bit of liquid at the bottom of the dish. I don't know what I did wrong. Overall it was very tasty and my family did enjoy them. Quick (well minus peeling the potatoes!) and very simple. I used a bit more swiss cheese and used colby jack cheese since I didn't have cheddar. Very nice flavor. I will be making this again.

Although I usually follow recipes exactly as shown, I made a few changes on this one. I omitted the onion (my main dish had onions in it) and I used real cheese instead of the low-fat stuff. Although it baked up just fine I found the flavor somewhat lacking.  I'm sure onions would have helped but even so it baked up a little too dry for me. Overall it's a good base recipe to start with to create your own version of Scalloped Potatoes as there aren't many decent recipes here for it. I will be making this again.

We stayed briefly with my inlaws after Hurricane Katrina, and I took over the cooking while we were there.  I used this recipe the first night, and my hubby and father in law asked for it again while we were there, and again when we stayed with them during Hurricane Rita a few weeks later.  Great recipe!

These turned out better than any other attempt at scalloped potatoes. The first time I made it, it was way too liquidy. My second attempt I halfed the milk and they were perfect.

The first time I made this I omitted the onions but the next time I added them and must say that the onions add flavour and moisture to an otherwise rather dry dish. Also I added sharp cheddar to the recipe which added richness and decadent. This is a good "go to" potato recipe with the above modifications.

My family loves this recipe.  I made it for Christmas Dinner with the In-laws and they loved it too.  It can be made fancy by cooking it in a dressed-up casserole dish.  Too easy, and absolutely delicious!

This was really good.  I shredded my onion so, I wouldn't bite into a big chunk.  Otherwise, I made it as stated and it was great.  Thanks.

This recipe is excellent. I didn't add the onions as my kids don't like them, otherwise followed the recipe.  I'll never make the regular scalloped taters anymore!

This was hands down the worst scalloped potato recipe I've ever made.  It was soupy and took about twice as long to prepare.  Ick.

WOW!!!  Made from scratch scalloped potatoes!  I've made this recipe several times.  Everyone loves this dish!  Somewhat time consuming but the results are definitely worth it.

Scrumptious! I used a shredded cheese mix, and added more pepper, some garlic powder, and paprika. Some problems: too much milk and too low of an oven temp to get potatoes soft enough. Half the amount of milk was enough. As the temp was too low, I ended up having to cook it an additional 45 minutes, the last 20 of which were at 400 F. Next time I will cook at a higher temp for the entire 50-60 minutes before adding the cheese topping. Still-- it was delicious! Thanks. I'll use again and continue to modify until it's just right. :)

No one thought this was great.  Too much onion flavour and I only used one onion.  Will not make this again.

This is a great recipe that I would use again.  I modified slightly to use shallots instead of onions and real full fat non-processed cheddar cheese - (English farm house and a red Leicester). Yummy.

I added chopped cooked ham. Next time I will slice my potatoes even thinner and lightly saute the onions first, as I found the onions still quite crunchy even after extra baking time (due to our not-thin-enough potato slices).  But overall, a very tasty basic recipe and I'll make it again.

After reading other reviews, I was careful to slice the potatoes really thin. Also, I only had one onion, so that was all I used. The results were delicious! My whole (somewhat picky) family loved this recipe. I'll make it again, for sure.

Pretty good.  I used a few sprinkles of onion powder instead of an onion, and I used only reduced fat medium cheddar.  I thought the potatoes were a good texture, not too dry or too liquid-y.  I would make these again.
