The fondant was very dry. It was so dry that I was unable to roll is smooth and move it.  The whole point to fondant is for a smooth look.  So even though it tasted good, I am giving it a low rating.  This was my first attempt at fondant.  So maybe I was part of the problem.  Next time, I will try a different recipe.

What you should do if is dry just add a couple drops of water and knead until just right. If it is to sticky just add a little more sugar until just right. If you want it to have flavor you can get clear vanilla extract or clear fruit extract flavoring at a store just add a couple drops. careful you will need to add more sugar to it if you do . when ready to store cover in a layer of Crisco( just rub all over fondant) and wrap tightly in plastic wrap and your ready.

Help!  I make a baby shower cake and used fondant.  when they went to cut it the cake crumbled under the fondant.  The fondant holds the moisture in and made it impossible to cut the cake.  Can anyone offer any suggestions????

Very good alternative to the typical marshmallow fondant I make. Easy to work with and not too sweet tasting!!! Will only use this recipe to cover the cake........Marshmallow fondant still my go to for bows, ribbons and forming flowers.........only because I don't think this recipe would hold its shape or dry as well due to the butter and milk...

Easy to make, tastes great! It makes a lot, so I lessen the servings to make less. I'm going to try to add some cocoa powder to make brown fondant next, since it's better than food coloring and may taste good too! If doing so, just lessen the amount of confectioners sugar, since you can always add more later. Enjoy!

I wanted quick and easy fondant and I guess this is what I get. It wasn't very good and I think I'll do the hard kind of fondant next time.

Will definitely make this recipe again I added about a cup of flour all together when the fondant got a little sticky but with homemade fondant stickiness is to be expected.

It had good flavor, but I had to add another 1 1/2 cup of powered sugar to make it the right consistency.
