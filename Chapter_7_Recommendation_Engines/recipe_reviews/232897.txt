Once you put the custard in the pie shell you better cook for 30 minutes. Will not be set in 10 minutes. Been making this for 42 years.

I used fresh key limes because I have a tree in my yard, and I wanted to find the perfect recipe! This was it! Several extended family members commented that this was the best key lime pie they have ever tasted! I followed the recipe exactly as directed. Awesome!

i wanted a simple key lime pie recipe to make quickly and saw this one. the pie had to bake for 30 minutes and really tasted like sweetened condensed milk. it also didn't hava a good lime flavor, there just wasn't enough. this pie was okay, but not anything i would make for a party

The BEST key lime pie recipe! I've never made it before - made it for my dad's birthday. The entire family loved it. Held it's form very well. Whipped cream was also the perfect amount of sweetness and cream! Love love love. Will never use another recipe again for key lime!

my whole family loved this!  i cheated because i used already-made graham crusts that were given to me by someone who bought them by accident, so i was trying to think of something to use with them.  this fit the bill perfectly!  since i love pecans, i chopped some and sprinkled them on the crust before browning in the oven.  i was skeptical about the whipping cream on top, but it was delicious and i look forward to making this again!  if i ever make the crust from scratch, i will add pecans throughout the mixture.  a local restaurant here does that with their key lime pie and it's great.  it gives the crust more substance.

This was the first time I had made, or even tasted, a key lime pie. It was wonderful; too rich to eat every day, but had great flavor. Rather than trying to squeeze out 2/3 cup of juice out of those tiny key limes, I bought a bottle of the 100% key lime juice and I also used a Keebler graham cracker crust. Those two shortcuts made preparation a breeze without sacrificing flavor or quality.

I tried this recipe for something light for summer my family LOVED it. My husband said it tasted better than anything he ever tasted. I then tried this with both lemons and oranges they were both VERY GOOD. This recipe is easy and the taste is a loop good with all three fruits.

We don't like things overly sweet so we added 2 Tablespoons of lime zest instead of just 2 tsp. Also added lime zest to the whipped cream, then put more on top. Delicious.

I needed an egg-free recipe for this bc of my g'daughter's allergies to eggs.  I then added 2 more TBS of lime juice and saved time by filling indiv. graham tart shells. I cooked 20 mins waiting for the 'bubbles' to appear but didn't.  So when I saw the edges cooking, I took them out of oven. I filled a shallow container with leftover filling, and wouldn't you know, it was a great, creamy consistency w/o any cooking!  Next time I will just fill and chill overnight and NO cooking.  It's summer, no need to bake bc it doesn't use eggs.

It's a nice creamy pie and easy enough to make. I cooked for 30 min as another reviewer suggested and that was perfect. For my taste it there just wasn't enough lime kick.

My First time making a pie at all.  Easy to follow instructions, and no intimidating ingredients.  Nice sweet and tart balance.  Next time, I'll get a zester, was a bit much to zest with my serrated knife!

This was my first attempt at key lime pie, and it was a hit with my husband. I rate this recipe 5 stars! On the topping, I used more powdered sugar than the 1/4 cup, enough to get the consistency I wanted. Also, I used fresh key lime juice, which I think made it perfect.

This turned out great! Only issue was having enough time f the key limes to get the 2/3 cup of juice. Even using a zesting tool  it was tough to get 2 teaspoons. The rest of the recipe was so say & it tasted heavenly with nice consistency. I would make it again.

This was an amazing pie and I will definitely make it again. I read the reviews first so I cooked the pie for thirty minutes rather then ten and I added crushed pecans to the crust. I will do the same next time.

I've been baking  this pie for years.  Never had added sour cream, but my recipe did call for egg.  I tried this recipe with the sour cream and it was delicious.  I used the bottled key lime juice because the store limes are about the size of cherries.
It works very well with the bottled juice.  By  the way, the 8-10 minute bake time is correct.  It does not have to be bubbling on top.  It will gel up very well when refrigerated.  As one baker stated, she placed left-over filling in the frig, unbaked, and it
was perfect.  I believe the 10 min. baking time was because of the raw egg in my recipe.  Also please purchase a zester.  My best cooking implement.

This is our new favorite recipe for Key lime pie!  It was so light and fluffy to the tongue.  My husband and I both loved it out small pieces.  Desserts are a treat to be savored over time, and not necessarily shared.  Saying that, I can't wait to serve this to special friends.  I did follow the recipe exactly, except I used a gluten free graham cracker crust since I am celiac.  I also used the whip cream on top of each cut piece rather than on top of the whole pie.  I think the pie will last a bit longer, since only the two of us will be eating it.   I have a whipper too, so the whipped cream stays fresh over several weeks.

I'm sure the quality of this is based on the quality of the key limes that are used, but I bought what I thought would be great fresh little key limes.  Just really not a good flavor nor strong enough lime flavor and I'm not willing to try again, even though it could have well have been the limes I used.

Loved it.  I used a purchased crust and whipped topping, but the filling was the most creamy I've ever tasted.  I used an extra 1/4 cup of lime juice because the taste wasn't strong enough and I like the sour to offset the sweet.  Will definitely make this again!

Followed as written except added more lime zest, just because I had extra.  And added lime zest to the whipped cream mixture .  Also took advice from other reviews and cooked for 30 min.  Husband LOVED it!!  Will make again and again!!  Oh and I bought the crust;)

Congratulations! Your days of searching for the perfect key lime pie recipe are finally over. I made this for my husband for Valentine's Day and it was absolutely DIVINE! Being from Florida, I know my key lime pies and this is by far the best one I have ever tasted. The fresh lime makes all the difference. This will be going into my pie repertoire for forever. This recipe is truly a gift and super duper easy to make, too. Make it! You'll be so glad you did.

WOW.. This recipe is perfect. So easy to make. When you take your first bite, you're doing the happy dance. 

When it came to the baking time for the whole pie itself, I'm not sure if the time in the instruction is correct. It said 7-10 to minutes, or when you see tiny bubbles. The pie was in the oven for about a 1/2 hour until I saw the tiny bubbles.
So keep in mind, the pie might be baking longer depending on your oven.

This pie was spot on.  I have just returned from Key West and was looking for a piece of pie that had this level of tart and sweet.  This recipe was absolutely perfect!! Truly a classic.

The flavor was good but the texture was heavy...more like a cheesecake.  I also had to increase the cooking time to 30 minutes.   Probably will not make this again.

I make this all the time for my family, friends and coworkers.  I put mine in 4 oz. mason jars and I put them in the freezer after I bake them.  A great way to grab and go to put in your lunch or take on picnics.  Also great for parties too.  When I use this recipe I add 1/3 cup more lime juice.  I also hand squeeze my limes and I also leave the pulp in mine.  WOW what an amazing flavor.  I love the fact its four ingredients and that's it.  So easy and simple.  My husband says, there is no Key Lime Pie out there that can compare to mine.  :)

Super simple and so good! I used a little extra lime just just because as I juiced the limes that’s how it worked out. This one is definitely a go to for a simple desserts.

This is quick and easy.  Mine did need to bake a bit longer than the suggested time....about 15 minutes before I saw little holes on the top, but I think I could have taken it out sooner.  I used a pre-made crust.   Remember, if you use a pre-made graham cracker crust, you have to set it on a baking sheet, or you won't get good results.

Followed recipe and really delicious.  Next time I will cut down the sugar in the crust somewhat as it was very sweet.  I will also increase the lime juice somewhat for more flavor.

I LOVE this recipe!! It tastes very citrusy and has a wonderful texture!! One thing that I do to add a slight bit more lime flavor though is add extra key lime juice and zest into the whipped cream. I've done this every time that I have made it and it works beautifully!!

This recipe is very easy to follow and quick to prepare. I have had requests from the American Legion twice!! The filling is yummy good...not too sweet as some key lime pies are. Fresh whip cream can be as think as you like on top and I sprinkle more lime zest. This is my go to recipe for key lime pie!!

I made one slight change to this recipe, I added almonds to the crust.  Other than that I followed it completely and it was fantastic! Using key limes though they're tedious to juice makes all the difference in the taste. I also sprinkled a bit of zest on top of the fresh whipped cream. Looking forward to making this again....our next family dinner

~Must bake for 30 minutes~ SHORT CUTS... I used a store bought graham crust and for the top I used Extra Creamy Cool Whip with the vanilla and powder sugar folded in.

WOW, this pie is RICH! I made it for Memorial Day, and we loved it. I'd suggest using a deep-dish pie pan for it. Also, if you're making the crust, use about 1 1/2 packages (there are 3 to each box!) of graham crackers and crumble them in a food processor.

Addendum to the above comment:

My wife suggested that we lower the amount of sour cream just a little bit, and it worked wonders! It's not AS rich, and the short baking time worked just fine.

Outstanding recipe. It was just the perfect amount of tartness and sweetness. I will definitely make it again.

I have always enjoyed key lime pie, but have never made one of my own. I always thought they would be difficult to make, but I was wrong! I quickly found this recipe and made it exactly as it was written except I used non-fat condensed milk and low fat sour cream. This pie was OUTSTANDING! It was so easy to make and turned out fabulous! So creamy and sweet, but tart. Everyone in the family, kids included, loved it!! It is definitely something I'll make again!

This was an outstanding recipe!  Aside from baking the filling for 20 minutes, I stuck to the directions.  I doubled the topping and it turned out just as amazing as the rest of the pie.  Thanks for sharing!

The only change that I made to this was adding 2 egg yolks, and one full egg! Turned out so much better!

Made this pie instead of a traditional birthday cake and received rave reviews from guests.  Key lime is hard to find so when you do, you can squeeze out juice and freeze until next use.  Great recipe.  Thank you.

Wonderful recipe.  Fabulous pie.  I added the pulp as well that came out while grating the peel.  What a yummy kick!

Got the key lime fever after a trip to Florida. Not a big pie eater until after our trip and this recipe.

It was great! It was my first attempt at key lime pie and I am going to make it again very soon. The only change is that I had to bake the pie longer in the oven to get it more cooked for the slightly bubbly top. About 8-10 londer than the recipe states.

I tried a slight variation of this recipe and found that they worked really well as cupcakes, the batter was plenty stiff to hold up to the smaller individual serving size but I did think the flavor was a little lacking on the signature key lime tartness

I used 1/2 cup key lime juice and liked the sweet-tart balance better.
