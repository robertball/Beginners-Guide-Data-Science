They were really good but still needed a little more flavor. Next time maybe some more brown sugar and cinnamon. I mixed up some butter and maple syrup (oops no honey...) and that made them wonderful snacks!

Well, maybe I did someting wrong, but the dough was so wet and gooey, I had to work more flour into it just so I could handle it.  I think that's too much pumpkin puree.  The finished product was tough and dry.

Fabulous if you make the following changes: increase spices: 1 tbsp ground cinnamon, 1 tsp  ground nutmeg, 1 tsp ground ginger, 1/2 tsp ground cloves. Added 1 tsp baking soda, upped the brown sugar to 1/4 cup. Combined 2/3 cup milk with 1 tsp vinegar and whisked with 1 and 1/2 cups of pumpkin puree. Dropped 8 to 10 biscuits on parchment paper and baked for 17 minutes. Oddly great with a thai pumpkin soup (nice mix of sweet and savoury).

This sounds like it would be wonderful, but they don't come out very well.  The taste is okay, but the texture isn't so great.  Maybe with some modifications it would be better...I don't know if I'll make this again.

These biscuits are a bit plain, but still yummy!    But:  -Drop the pumpkin to 1 1/2 cups.  -Add more sugar   -And spice   -And all things nice if you like    This recipe is perfect as part of Christmas or Thanksgiving breakfast!

I made this with a Sunday night "turkey dinner, and my friends loved them!  I lowered the pumpkin on advice from a previous reviewer but probably won't do that again.

I found that making a few minor adjustments to this recipe...First set your oven to 350 not 400, next I added an extra 1/4 tsp of baking powder, I only used 3/4 of the 15 0z can of pumkin puree and doubled my spices plus added allspice. The biscuits rose and came out awesome. Don't expect the taste to be strong they're biscuits not pumkin pie.

These were tasty, but small. The texture wasn't quite what I hoped for. They didn't rise much and weren't fluffy or flaky like I imagine biscuits to be. I might make these again.

maybe I did something wrong, but these were unedible.  I like the idea of pumpkin biscuits, but this wasn't it.  When the recipe stated to pat the dough down I should have had a feeling these were going to flop.  They were very gooey and sticky (one could not use a rolling pin) I should have added more flour.  I even had to increase the baking time as they were raw and doughy in the center at first.  They never did cook right. And they stayed flat.

These biscuits were very easy to make. My kids loved them and they had a pleasing, light pumpkin flavor. My only complaint is that they need a bit more spice. Next time I will add more cinnamon.

If this is your first time making biscuits, don't try this recipe.  But, if you know what biscuit dough is supposed to feel like, by all means, make these yummy biscuits!  Just keep adding flour until the consistency feels right.  Wow!  I added extra spices (maybe double the amounts), and they came out fabulous!

Make sure you oil your hands and have lots of flour on hand before handling - very gooy (I used fresh pureed pumpkin).  It took longer to bake but was very good fresh out of the oven.  Once they cooled off the texture was little doughy.  Would be great with a hot soup on a cool day fresh out of the oven!

I wish I would have read other reviews before making this.  I ended up with runny dough.  After adding another full cup of flour it still wasn't solid enough to cut into a biscuit shape.  I made drop biscuits and they didn't have a lot of flavor.  I'm not sure how this recipe can be fixed but it didn't work for me!

Mmmm... these were excellent.  I found that the serving amounts were quite incorrect, however.  For "36" servings, you might be lucky to get out 5 biscuits in reality.  So make tons!  These are great.

I dediced to try this recipe even with the mixed reviews.  If you are looking for something to tase like pumpkin pie or muffin, this is not it.  I made a butternut squash risotto and had these with it and it was delicious.  I did take Brooke's suggesions and did the following:  increase spices: 1 tbsp ground cinnamon, 1 tsp ground nutmeg, 1 tsp ground ginger, 1/2 tsp ground cloves. Added 1 tsp baking soda, upped the brown sugar to 1/4 cup. Combined 2/3 cup milk with 1 tsp vinegar and whisked with 1 and 1/2 cups of pumpkin puree. Dropped 8 to 10 biscuits on parchment paper and baked for 17 minutes.

This was an awesome recipe, and a great way to use leftovers. You may have to alter the amount of flour depending on how moist your squash mash is, but you don't want it too stiff. Cut and lift carefully, placing a little bit of flour on your surface so it wont stick as you cut.  I made it the original way, and improvised 3 other ways. I found that the original recipe is not as good as my alternates.  I used leftover butternut squash, with ranch dressing & italian seasoning; mash potatoes with milk & horshradish; and sweet potato with italian and garlic. Much better than the pumpkin & nutmeg/cinnamon!

I have made 100's of recipes from this site and do not usually review, but had to on this one: I made these. I shortened it up a bit and used a baking mix instead of flour, and baking powder, and added more spices and brown sugar for flavor. They turned out just like the posted picture and tasted wonderful!! My dough was soft and pliable and they did rise a bit too. I will be making these again, as I have 6 tubs of fresh pureed pumpkin in my freezer!!

Lets just call them scones. They didnt rise. They crackled on top like a molasses cookie. Smear some frosting on top and they are great scones. And thats what I will use this recipe as.

This was an easy recipe to make. They did not rise well at all and needed more spice flavor.  At half inch thick, I was only able to cut out 18 biscuits.

Please do not attempt this feat!  I tried the recipe with help from reviews, mid-baking made adjustments,and to no avail was able to make this recipe work.  It is dry, bland, and even with Cream Cheese Frosting-unediable.  I made this for a Potluck to go with another recipe and had to throw it all away!  I'm sorry, but this just won't do.

These were definitly different but really good. They were somewhat bland but I think maybe doubling the spices would help with that. My family enjoyed them.

Oh my!!  These are burning my mouth as I eat them fresh from the oven.  They are unbelievable.  Sooooo good.  They were perfect to roll out and rose wonderfully.  I used fresh pureed pupmkin, and I might suggest that if you're using canned, draining it first (w/ a cheesecloth lined strainer) might help with the sticky results problem.  Oh!  And mine needed 15 minutes tops in a 400 oven.

Unfortunately these just didn't do it for me. Right after I pulled them out of the oven I tried one with a little apple butter and it was so yummy! However, once they cooled they seemed to have virtually no flavor and they went from being fluffy to chewy. Serve them warm and straight from the oven!!! Thanks for letting me try them! :)

I added an extra cup of flour and mixed them in the food prcessor.  I use an ice-cream scoop to form them into biscuits and flatten them before baking.  Next time, I will double the amount of baking powder to make them lighter.

I really liked these biscuits with butter and rasberry jam. Delicious. They are a bit bland if you want them to eat alone I would add more brown sugar and spices. The texture is different from a traditional biscuit, so I didn't roll out. I used an ice cream scoop and it worked to make great drop biscuits. I also used 2 cups self-rising flour and 1/2 whole wheat flour and eliminated the baking powder. I also ended up adding a little milk to make my batter the right consistency.

The basic idea was good, but I think the measurments are off. I had to add almost double the flour to even make the dough workable. I definitly added more spices and a little more brown sugar too in order to get a good taste to it. The amount is off too, I got maybe 1/2 of what it said it would make. But all in all after I made adjustments they tasted good.

Very good. Everybody at my Thanksgiving get together said it was warm and moist and really excellent.

I made these for a late afternoon snack today, and they were simply amazing. They are light and fluffy, and eaten right out of the oven, they don't need any additional butter, honey, or other flavors added. I thought the spice amounts were just perfect; they enhanced the pumpkin flavors without overwhelming them.

I do have to say; however, that I can't see how anybody could possibly get 36 biscuits out of this recipe and still have any height to them. I was able to get exactly 18 out of a batch.

This is a great beginning, but I have a few suggestions. Increase flour to 3 cups, double cinnamon and ginger and add 3/4 tsp of cream of tarter. I made those changes and came out with a wonderful biscuit. It tastes delicious warm or cold and it's flaky.

Firstly, the prescribed temperature of 400 was not hot enough. These should be baked at 450. Secondly, the flavor was "blah." I had really high hoped for these, but they just did not hit the mark. 2 cups of pumpkin and seemingly scant amounts of spices did not make for yummyness. I will try again with different measurements of ingredients and see if it can be improved.

Not too sweet but sweet enough to satisfy grandbabies and 
my "culinary critic" son. I made them as drop biscuit in muffin tin. I will definitely make these again.

I made this once, then made it again with cream cheese balls on the inside. They are delectable. 

(Substituted 3/4 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice for seasoning.)

Delicious! Very moist and tasty twist on traditional biscuits.  I used squash from my freezer for the pumpkin purée.

These were really tasty. They were moister than a regular biscuit but had a great flavor. Definitely worth the change from the ordinary.

These turned out really nice!   I don't know why the reviews aren't better.   
I ended up using the entire can of pumpkin to get rid of it, and it worked OK.   They turned out light and fluffy, but do not expect it to be a sweet treat like pumpkin scones or bread.  Also, "36 servings" is really inaccurate.   I only got 12 2-inch biscuits out of the whole batch.   Would make again!

Unfortunately, mine turned out like hockey pucks. They didn't rise. I think I must have mixed them too much, and the dough was very sticky and hard to handle.

Great recipe! We had a ton of of pumpkin puree left over from our farm share. I added extra pumpkin (mostly just to get rid of it) - they turned out super well.

I followed other review advice to increase the spices, and I added extra flour until the texture was right. The biscuits were fluffy (but not flaky) with good pumpkin flavor.

I like plenty of spices so I doubled the spices with the exception of the cinnamon, of which I used a heaping tablespoon. I also substituted 1/2 cup milk for 1/2 cup of the pureed pumpkin to help with the texture. We love them this way!

I doubled the cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg, and used sea salt instead of table salt.  Deliciously wonderful!
