This was very good.  I served these on hard taco shells for a change of texture.  I didn't have any cayenne pepper, so I added some crushed red pepper flakes instead.  I also added about a cup and a half of cooked rice and about 2/3 cup of frozen corn.  Terrific topped with avocado, tomato, and lettuce.  It made a lot and the leftovers were great too.

Definitely a keeper. My daughter is vegan, while the rest of the family isn't. My husband usually can't stand non meat recipes, and loved this one!! With chips, salsa and cheese,  it's the best. Thanks for the great recipe.

I LOVED these!  I followed the recipe exactly and served on warm tortillas with cabbage - it was quick and very easy.  We will definitely be having these again.  Thanks!  Update...I have been serving these on corn tortialls and find that the tortillas come apart very easily.  So this time I made a quesadilla with two corn tortillas and stuffed it with the taco filling and some sour cream.  Yummy and much easier to eat!

Very good and easy to make.  I only mashed one can of the beans and left the other whole.  I only used a pinch of cayenne.  I filled burrito-sized tortillas and then "fried" them for a few minutes in a non-stick pan coated w/ vegetable spray.

Added a cup of cooked rice.  Mashed one of the cans of beans but left the other whole.  I cut back on the cayenne to 1/2 tsp for the sake of the kids.  Served it with lettuce, cheese, sour cream, tomatoes, guacamole, and and salsa.  For the kids, I turned them into quesadillas instead of soft tacos.  It was very good, but I think the toppings added a lot.  Without the toppings, it would have been pretty good, but not fantastic.

I made this for my vegetarian daughter and it was so good I served it to the whole family for dinner.  A perfect blend of spices, it was just hot enough for our tastes.  We ate them on whole wheat tortillas with lettuce, tomatoes, cheese and salsa.

This stuff is the bomb.  Even my carnivore husband loved it!  It's also good with Rotel instead of salsa.  Will definitely make this again.

This recipe is delicious!! I love it. I changed the seasonings around a bit to suit me, and it tastes great! I have already made this 2 times and have passed this recipe on to others. They love it too! I serve it with a splash of hot sauce. Yummy. Thanks for this awesome recipe!

These were very good, the whole family loved them. I served them as a side dish with cottage cheese enchiladas from all recipes. I left out the corn meal and added a little more salsa.

I love this recipe! It was easy to make, and it will last me forever (it keeps well in the fridge.) The only thing I will change next time is to use half as much green pepper. I can taste the green pepper a bit too much for my liking.

Good recipe. I omitted the corn meal, no need for it. I didn't have any cumin so I added taco seasoning and it was great. I will make this again. My boyfriend who LOVES meat ate it and liked it.  I used someone's suggestion and didn't mash the beans all the way, and it gives it a heartier texture.

I don't know why this rates so high because it just taste okay for mashed beans. There wasn't anything special about them at all. I would make them again but with vegetarian/vegan refried beans (no need to mash them myself again), salsa and a pinch of sea salt so they're not bland. They would taste better, IMO, on the side with some Spanish rice and veggie crumble tacos for a more authentic tasting Mexican meal. These beans would serve much better on burritos than tacos.

Being a committed carnivore, I just can't bring myself to give it 5 stars.  If it was meat, it would be 5 stars.  This is very good, and I really only made two minor changes.  I used cooking spray to reduce the oil and fat (which admittedly, is already low), and I curtailed the cayenne, using just a few dashes instead of the recommended amount (if I hadn't, wife would have divorced me for sure!).  Served like normal tacos, with the addition of some diced avocado as a topping option.  I will certainly make these again, as it almost tricks me into thinking it is meat!

This recipe is delicious! I added corn and okra to the sautee and then used this filling to make quesadillas. Will definitely make often.

I have made this recipe five or six times in single or double batches and it has turned out really well each time. I usually freeze it into small containers to pull out for quick burrito or taco suppers. It's healthy, delicious, quick and very easy to make. The flavour of this dish goes particularly well with chopped avacado and tomato.     As a side note- I am part of a group of moms who have a "community cooking day" every other month where we cook in bulk and take home 20 meals for our families. Twice, we have made octuple (8x) batches of this recipe (in a large soup pot). While it is a little more challenging in that volume to get the right consistency (an immersion blender does the trick!), it still turns out very well!

Very good!  I did not need the cornmeal to thicken this, but I added a little frozen corn for flavor.  I adjusted the seasonings for my wimpy family.  We made tacos with this bean filling, sauteed red and green sliced peppers and sauteed pnions.  At the table we added fresh chopped onions, avocado,extra salsa and fresh shredded cabbage.  Yummy!

Excellent! We are trying to go vegan and it is hard to find recipes without too much soy. This was a great alternative and the consistency was wonderful...you truly didn't miss the meat!

This was phenomenal! My husband was very excited for "meatless" Monday :) I followed the recipe, but I replaced the salsa with Rotel. After I made the filling, I layered about a spoonfull of the mixture into the center of each flour tortilla and made it to burritos. Using someone else's suggestion on the site, I grilled each burrito in a non-stick skillet coated with PAM. A fast and easy dinner that I will surely make again!

What a great tasty burrito filling these made. I totally forgot the corn meal and they were still wonderful, in fact they were so thick I added some chopped green chilies to it to thin it down some. We made burritos and also dipped some homemade tortillas into it...will make this one again.

Very easy to make!  This will also be a good addition to my gluten-free repertoire!  Extremely tasty and easy to substitute for things you have in the house (vegetarian refried beans for black, 2 tomatoes and juice of half a large lime for the salsa) THANKS!

This is SO GOOD!!!  I subbed pinto beans instead of black (all I had on hand), and nixed the cornmeal and cayenne.  Served this on homemade wheat tortillas and my husband and I loved them!  He's not even vegan and he said he'd love it for dinner once a week -- cheap, easy, tasty and healthy, I will definitely make this one again.  Thanks!

I have finally found an alternative to beef for tacos! This recipe was fantastic! I brought it to a dinner party and all the "meat eaters" loved it! Most people had second helpings.  I followed the recipe as its written and will def. make again and again.

Pretty good! Tastes pretty much like I thought it would, I did not have enough salsa on hand so I added a little tomato sauce. I just wanted to try it so I whipped up a half batch for lunch and stuck it on a tortilla. would be great with shredded lettuce, tomatoes, black olives and avacado!

Good recipe, but way too much cumin for us - it overpowers other ingredients. I didn't bother with cayenne and paprika. I used green salsa instead of red, which gives it a nice fresh taste.

This was just ok for us.  I think it was a tad heavy on the cumin.  It did make a nice alternative meatless meal.

I halved this recipe and ate it with spinach and herb flavored tortillas. It was really good, but maybe a touch too spicy. Also seemed like it needed a touch more salsa to make it less dry, but overall, this was insanely quick to make and tasty.

Vegetarian wife loved it, picky kids split on it and Mr. Carnivore seemed to enjoy it but he preferred it would have been meat-  but what else is new.   I was not able to fool anyone into thinking it was meat like I was hoping.  I followed the recipe exactly & overall I thought was an easy, tasty & healthy recipe. I will be making again.  Thx 4 sharing!

Pretty good, VERY simple!  I opted to mash the beans in the pan after I had sauteed the onions, peppers and garlic.  I hate dirtying multiple dishes if I don't have to.  My boyfriend was skeptical at first but ended up loving it as well.

I followed this recipe  and it's ingredients.  It was gross.  The texture was grainy.  It was way to thick to use as a dip and the taste was much less than good.  I will never make this again.

This is an awesome recipe for taco filling; we make it all the time for tacos and burritos. A bit of sour cream on top adds great flavor and takes away some of the hot spiciness (in case that's a concern).

The only changes I made was using a can of Rotel instead of salsa and did not mash the beans.  It made a wonderful chunky filling!  I served mine in tortillas topped with plain yogurt and cheese.  Can't go wrong with this recipe!

Excellent as-is.  I've also tried this with diced tomatoes instead of salsa when I didn't have any on hand and it was still wonderful.

STELLAR recipe!  Changes I made: started with dried beans (that were cooked in vegetable stock) rather than canned beans, added one small can of diced green chiles, and used smoked paprika rather than the usual paprika.  Excellent for tacos, burritos, nachos.  Leftovers make a great cold dip for tortilla chips & would be great in a 7-layer dip.  Could also thin it out with veggie stock to make a great soup.  Hot or cold, it pairs well with diced tomato and sour cream.  The recipe could easily be halved for smaller families & still have enough for two meals if served taco-style.  Our family of three all loved it, but hubby & pre-schooler won't eat leftovers of the same dish more than once.  Overall, a great, healthy, versatile dish.  Thank you for sharing!

awesome recipe! i added half a package of soyrizo. My wife is a veggie and im not, so i added the soyrizo for a little meaty texture. I also added 1 minced chipotle pepper for a nice smokey touch.

Due to a recent switch to veganism, I am relying more and more on beans to create filling meals.  This taco filling is delicious, super flavor packed, and simple to make, you'll never miss meat tacos!  My non-vegan roommates keep finishing off batch after batch!

Very NICE! i followed your recipe minus the cornmean, and oops, i had no cumin and it STILL was outstanding! I recomend using a higher end salsa for this - like a Jack's Special with Cilantro, we had it with burito's and yellow safron rice, even my husband liked it, thank you for the recipe!

SPECTACULAR!  I make this for our family's meatless nights, typically for burritos.  I leave out the cayenne since the rest of the spices are enough for my children.  I add jalapenos to the burritos for the extra kick that my husband and I enjoy.  Definitely a meatless favorite in our home!!

Requires no tweaking!  This became the vegetarian option for a taco night and it was great!  I used a combination of red and yellow bell peppers which made it kinda pretty.  Thumbs up!

I am currently participating in a Daniel Fast.  I have learned so much about what I was consuming from this.  I will say that this recipe is amazing.  It made me feel as if this is the way a taco should be made without meat.  I changed the recipe just a little for lack of ingredients. Such as I left out the cayenne pepper and paprika.  But other than that everything stayed the same.  I will definitely be eating this again soon!

This recipe is made twice as good by NOT adding the cornmeal and using MASA instead. Adjust seasoning ( i do not like so much cayenne but I do like some with smoked paprika, not plain)  Makes a great dip!   Omit most of the salsa, add a bit of cooked sticky rice to bind it and it makes some pretty good little 'patties' when fried w/out oil in a stick free pan.

This is the best!  I have used this as a filling for make-ahead burritos.  Just put a large spoonful of this filling into a taco-sized tortilla, wrap into a burrito, cover with aluminum foil, and freeze in a ziploc baggy.  I make these ahead of time and heat them in the microwave when I'm in a hurry for lunches.

I have made this recipe a few times and think it's great - easy to modify, easy to make, healthy and inexpensive! I prefer to reduce the cumin to about 1/2 to 3/4 of a Tbsp and may tone down the cayenne depending on the audience, although I like it spicy!  Last time I used a combo of black and kidney beans, reserved about 1/4 can whole beans from each and lightly pulsed the rest in a processor.  It's nice to have a few whole beans for texture. I squeezed some liquid out of the onions and peppers after cooking them by placing them in a colander and pressing with a spoon and used a fork to scoop the salsa to reduce liquid content.

Recently I used half of the filling to make veggie patties by adding flax-egg substitute (1 Tbsp flax to 3 Tbsp water, mix and let set for 5 minutes) and half cup of bread crumbs.  Formed into 4 patties and baked at 350 on a baking pan lined with parchment paper for about 7-10 minutes each side. I believe the liquid reducing measures helped keep the patties formed.  Liked these 'burgers' better than the highly rated black bean burger recipe on this site.  They're easy to grab for lunch and significantly less expensive than store bought!

Awesome! I used a can of Rotel instead of salsa and I left the black beans whole (if you simmer for a bit they will break down a little but it won't be a paste, just like a hearty salsa) Then I added some griled corn right off the cob. The sweetness of the corn offsets the spice and completes the flavor. I also added a bit of lime juice. Great on tacos or as a hot dip for chips. Perfect for a cinco de mayo potluck! It's a keeper!

This is a good, quick and cheap recipe. I chose it to make something easy for supper. Not fantastic, but good for beans. The flavor here depends on salsa you use. I used homemade tomato salsa, added lime juice and didn't use cornmeal. Next time I would definitely add cilantro and maybe cheese.

This is sublime. I made it exactly as written and it was absolutely delicious. With apologies to vegans, other times I added some ground turkey to it and it was also delicious. Great recipe! Thanks.

Made this for a friend that doesn't eat meat and it was really good.  I was surprised how much I enjoyed this.  I did mix some of the leftovers with taco meat and it was amazing.  I also like this as a dip with blue corn chips.

I made this recipe and put the filling in soft taco shells as a more low calorie option.  They were delicious, but a bit too spicy for me even when I only used 1/2 teaspoon of the cayenne pepper.  I have a sensitive stomach and can not handle spicy foods well so I'll just leave out the pepper next time.

Very tasty and great for the waste line!  The only thing I will change next time I make it is cutting the cayenne pepper in half.  It was pretty spicy and my daughter could not eat it at all.

This is so delicious.  I've always loved bean burritos and never thought of making one myself.  This recipe is perfect.  I did increase the cumin and I added one chipotle and a little of the chipotle sauce and had it on a warmed whole wheat tortilla.  I completely forgot to add the cornmeal; I'll try it the next time I make it which will be very soon. It is delicious and filling.  I'll make this often.

So easy and so fabulous. I read the reviews and did what some recommended: removed the cornmeal. Used Rotel instead of Salsa and added frozen corn.  It was great sour cream and avocado slices.

Awesome taco filling!  I omitted the cornmeal because it didn't need thickening and I cut down on the cayenne for my kids.  My family loved it including my 4 yr old.  Thank you so much for sharing.  I will be making this again!

This was fantastic!  I added a little goya ham base, for a meaty taste to it.  This is perfect for me since i'm trying to eat healthier and add two veg meals a week to my diet!  Wonderful!

Fabulous recipe! Even a picky teenage meat lover couldn't get enough!! I didn't have any cumin but the flavour was still great- not spicy at all. We sprinkled grated cheese on top and served it with tortilla chips- soooo good!

This was a hit served as a dip with tostadas.  The food processor made quick work of preparation.  I omitted the cayenne as I used a "hot" hot sauce, and it had just a little kick so the children could enjoy it also.  Also left out the cornmeal as it didn't need to be thickened.  Otherwise I followed the recipe - just toss the sauted veggies and drained beans in the processor and process until desired consistency is achieved.  Garnish with chopped cilantro - as one guest stated, "I could have eaten the entire bowl for my meal!"  No more over-priced canned bean dip for me!

A little mushy to fit with taco shells. I didn't mind that but my husband preferred it as a burrito filling. Either way, definitely has a great flavor. It'd a repeat recipe around here for sure!  I did cut back on the cayenne the second time I made it, as it was a bit spicy for my 3 year old.

I tried this recipe because my teenage daughter has become a vegetarian and this was great. Not only did she like but the rest of us did too. I didn't have cayenne pepper so instead I put in some cry mustard. (only thing I had) very yummy will definitely make again for our family as well as for get togethers!!

Too spicy,  and too gritty w/ the cornmeal. I needed to add a bunch of water to make it less pasty. Just not really worth the effort, for the average taste.

Excellent! I did omit the cornmeal and replaced the bell pepper with a green chile, but otherwise followed the recipe. I spooned into tortillas, added a little fat free sour cream and shredded cheese, rolled up, then topped with a thin line of taco sauce. Baked at 350 for about 15 minutes. Very good! Thank you :)

I loved this and so did the family.  It was really easy to make and tasted great!  I'm vegetarian, but family is not, they were making fish tacos I decided to make this.  They tried a bit and all loved it.  I added a bit of chili powder to it as I like it a little bit spicier!

Very good recipe! next time I will try with some Taco (or beef) flavored TVP. Also, I used red beans and the mixture was very malleable... I might try to make bean burgers with this one too! Thanks!!!

This is yummy and easy. After experimenting with the original recipe, I've made a few modifications. 

I skip the cornmeal because I don't think really adds anything and it does give it a slightly odd texture. I also sometimes add extra bell pepper, and often replace the chili powder with fresh chopped hot peppers. 

This refrigerates, freezes, and reheats well.

Personally, I found it just a little too spicy. The flavor of the beans, pepper, and onion was so good, and I think the spices covered that up too much. I'll make it again, but cut back on the spices a bit.

I omitted the cumin because it's not a spice we care for.  I added a few additional Tablespoons of salsa so we wouldn't loose flavor.  I also added 1 can of black beans and 1 can of pinto beans (instead of all black beans).  Just be aware the finished product is quite thick - which is great if you're using it as a spread.  I'll thin out the left-overs with extra salsa and use it as a dip.  Give this one a try - it's good.

Omitted the cumin due to a family allergy. I also didn't have cornmeal so I just left it out. I used Rotel instead of salsa. Served on tostada shells with lettuce, tomato, etc. Very good! Plenty of leftovers for lunches the next day.

This is very delicious and so simple. I changed nothing except for using a little less salsa. Oh and I skipped the cornmeal because I didn't have any. I made no additions though and I didn't feel like the recipe needed any. I did top my first taco with just sour cream but I left it off my second taco and preferred it that way. Thanks for the recipe, I'll definitely make again - and I'm not even vegan or vegetarian!

I made this last night for dinner and it was really yummy.  I'm glad I saved the drained bean juice because I had to add that back in along with some water and covered the pot and let it simmer for 10 minutes or so for the flavors the meld. I fried my taco shells until crispy and had cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, olives and salsa as add-ons. This recipe is a keeper. Thanks for posting.

We loves these.  If we don't have cornmeal on hand we use flour and it doesn't affect the flavor for us.  I like leftovers as a cold bean dip for tortilla chips.

I really enjoyed this.  I tweaked it a little and put a whole jar (16 oz) of salsa in it.  Also, I didn't have the bell pepper on hand.  Still tasted great!

I halved the recipe. It was the perfect amount for my husband and I. There was a bit too much cumin for our taste, so I would reduce that by half next time. I put the mixture in a flour tortilla with some mexican rice, rolled it and fried it so that I had a chimichanga while he had soft tacos. Served it with lettuce. It was great. Didn't miss meat at all!

Great taste!  I used chili powder, and omitted the cayenne pepper!  I rolled the filling in a tortilla shell, and made little pinwheels.

This is too spicy as it is for us. We prefer the taste of the store bought taco seasonings so I just used the 1 teaspoon each of salt and paprika and 2 teaspoons of chili powder and omitted the cumin. I didn't like the cornmeal texture either - too gritty.  This recipe is a good jumping off point to develop my own bean filling recipe though.

Surprisingly awesome. Do this once as per the recipe exactly - you won't be disappointed. After that you realize you can pretty much do anything with it based on what you have leftover in your house and it will be pretty darned good.

This was very good. I made it for my small kids so I cut the amount of cayenne in half. It was still a little too spicy for them but I liked it a lot. Ill be making this again! Thanks for the great recipe.

I didn't have any canned black beans in the house, so I prepared a bag of white beans.  I also didn't have any paprika, so I used some turmeric instead, which added good color and flavor.  This recipe was excellent.  Definitely don't even miss the meat with this filling recipe.

I cooked the mashed black beans and whole-grain cornmeal.  Then in a separate bowl I mixed the raw uncooked white onion, garlic, red bell pepper (red is higher in nutrition than green), cumin, paprika, 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper, chili powder, 1 tsp salt, and fresh uncooked salsa.  I spread the warm bean mixture on tostada shells and warm flour tortillas.  Then I topped the warm bean mixture with the uncooked vegetable & spice mixture.  I had a friend over who had several helpings.

This recipe came out delicious - the spices were perfect.  I prefer a vegetarian diet, but with a husband and tween son who are bigger eaters that can be a challenge.  However they were very satisfied with this recipe, even for dinner.  I served the bean filling in a a warmed tortilla as a wrap, and a dallop of guacamole and salsa on the plate to dip them in.

Great taco filling!  I also used the leftovers to make Frito pie (Fritos topped with the bean filling and then some cheese), which was also very good.

I made this last night and it is sooo easy and has a great flavor. Like another review,I only used 1/2 of the cayenne,I put the taco filling on a heated tortilla and topped with cheese,lettuce and home grown tomatoes. My husband thinks he has to have meat,so in his I added some ground turkey. Thanks for a great recipe that I will use many times!

Perfect for change of pace as I am try not to eat that much meat these days. I cook for myself and like spicy food, so i suggest adding a jalapeno and instead of salsa one can of spicy Rotel. Enjoy it, this is a great recipe.

I made this into enchiladas. My family is big on Mexican food and I am always looking for healthier ways to prepare our favorites. I just rolled the mixture into tortillas, covered with a bit of cheese, leftover salsa and some olives. My family was shocked when I told them there wasn't any meat, and even more shocked when they saw the nutritional values lying on my kitchen table. Amazing dish. P.S. I skipped on the cayenne for the kids.

I followed the recipe (almost) to the tee.  The only thing that I added was some salt, and a little sugar to balance the flavors.  On top of hard tostada shells this was simply fantastic!.  Thank you for letting vegans know that they can enjoy mexican flavors without compromise!.

I actually used this for the bean mixture in the Seven Layer Dip I recipe instead of the refried for a nice vegetarian/kosher (and healthier) seven layer dip. I did change things up: I use pinto beans, which I prefer over black beans. I also cut the bell pepper and instead of cayenne pepper, I added an extra teaspoon of chili powder. Lastly, I substituted chopped, fresh cilantro for the cornmeal...amount to your taste. I highly recommend the latter if available, it gives it an authentic flavor!

I actually wish I could give this 5 stars but I had one issue.  This was super spicy!!  I scanned the top reviews and there was no mention of it.  I would suggest decreasing the cayenne pepper.  Next time I make it I'll use a 1/2 tsp.  My girls and I love beans so once the spice intensity is resolved this is sure to be a family fave.

For the first time in my life I actually followed the recipe to the letter and am glad I did, because this is wicked good. I used it to fill hard shell tacos topped with fine-shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes, shredded sharp Cheddar (not vegan), and Ortega smooth taco sauce. They were so tasty that I'm officially finished with my long search for the perfect taco filling. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a delicious, easy, and nutritious recipe! I found the cumin called for in the recipe overpowering, so I used the Taco Seasoning I in place of all the spices, since it has about the same spices in it.  I ate it as a dip for tortilla chips, husband ate it in a flour tortilla with cheese and sour cream.  We both enjoyed it!

Came out great. Thicker than expected, but not problematic. I put it on top of fried bread and topped it with cut spinach, lettuce, and cilantro and drizzled it with taco sauce. Very filling and tasted great!

This recipe was easy, fast and tasty. I used a soft tortilla and topped it with tomatoes, green onions and a little cilantro. The fresh toppings really add to the recipe.

I made this twice. The first time I followed recipe exactly and  they were very good just took a bit of time...
The second time I used a 28 oz can of  refried beans instead of  the 2 cans of black beans, (we prefer the pinto beans). I sauteed the onion and added the refried beans along with 1 pkt of hot Taco mix and 1 cup of salsa...Stir and cook about 5 minutes..Let sit while warming taco shells . Served with a sprinkle of fat free cheddar and shredded lettuce .

Made this twice now, so easy and fast. And forgiving! You can add or subtract easily. I will say that we found it rather too hot (spicy), probably because of the chipotle chile pepper I used - but still delicious.

This recipe is very easy to make. I made it with my daughter. We left out the bell peppers (kids don't like them) and  after reading other reviews we also left out the corn meal ( it is not necessary). I got distracted making guacamole and forgot to mention to my young daughter to go light on the seasonings so she followed the recipe exactly. The beans were too spicy for my family. I really enjoyed them, but they were just to spicy for the rest of my family. I made another batch cutting the spice in half and the family enjoyed them. Great recipe, just need to adjust heat for your liking.

I had all the ingredients on hand. I used cooked dry beans and I cut back on the cayenne a bit. I don't like things that spicy. I used the filling on soft homemade tortillas and I put a little shredded cabbage on top. It was so flavorful that I didn't need a lot of condiments. Thanks for the recipe! It's really affordable too. I'll be making it again.

This was so delicious!  I had a meat eater over for dinner who had seconds and rave reviews.   I could only eat one burrito because this was perfectly filling.  I did add a can of corn for a touch of sweetness to balance the spice.  This will be my go-to for taco/burrito night!

very tasty. I often make my own beans for tacos. they taste good but dry out. The salsa solved this issue. I gave it an extra spicy kick and left out the cornmeal. Easy to make and filling, but not heavy.
Will make again

Just finished making this. Followed the recipe almost exactly (replaced the cayenne pepper with red pepper flakes since that was what we had) and I have to say, as someone who just started cooking with meat "substitutes" today, it came out AMAZING! I was skeptical after a failed attempt at a chickpea sandwich filling but this reassured me greatly. Definitely making again, with brown rice, sour cream, and a bit of cheese in the tortilla. Thank you for the excellent recipe!

It had good flavor, but for me it needed a little salt and was a little dry as I mashed it too much - I'd mash it only moderately if I make it again.

We have made this several times & it is great as is, as well as a base for variety. Instead of mashing the beans by hand, I used my food processor to coarsley chop most of them and puree a small portion, just because it was an easy way to do it. I have used fresh garlic or garlic powder, varied seasonings for more spice or less depending on the preferences of kids/adults, etc. Also good with corn, tomatoes, green onions, lettuce or spinach, shredded cheese, sour cream. Delish! Embarrassingly, I ate 5 hard tacos last night...

I halted the recipe(it's just me) and since I hate have half of cut vegetables in the fridge I left out the bell pepper. I made this a second time, couldn't find the chili powder in the cabinet so I used some vegan taco seasoning. Both times were amazing. As a vegan in love with tacos and without the taste, or budget for fake meat, this is the best taco filling I've come across. And I've tried a lot :)

I make this once every couple of weeks for dinner.  It's simple, easy and a great meatless entree. My husband and I gorge on these tacos.  I follow the recipe other than tweaking the seasoning to satisfy our spicy cravings. We top with fresh made pico (chopped cilantro, tomato, onion and lime juice and a dash of sriracha smoked salt), shredded cabbage, and fresh avocado slices.  Sprinkle on some nutritional yeast for a little cheese flavor and slap this on crunchy or soft shells. Mucho bueno! Gracias!

Before considering my review, know that I added just a little to it. Instead of two can's of beans, I added rice, per the hint in the video. When completed I dressed with Cilantro and a thick beed of Valentina. It had a good balance of heat, texture and flavor. It was not mind blowing, however it was everything I would want from a standard taco. This recipe provided a great foundation. In the future I will try a squirt of lime, avocado and maybe a few hotter peppers. And maybe a margarita :)

I used my own taco seasoning(found on this site), instead of the spices listed in the recipe, and it was so good!!! I'm sure it would have been delicious with the recommended spices, but now that I make my own taco seasoning, I can't bring myself not to use it. :)

My meat-eating, bean-hating boyfriend was skeptical when I told him last month that we were having black bean tacos (he told me afterward that he was prepared to say they were good even though he wasn't going to like them) but in reality he loved them. He's requested them 3 or 4 times since then so I know he's not just trying to appease me.

Delicious!

I made them just as the recipe suggested.  Maybe I'll try making my own salsa next time to use.  Something wasn't quite "right".  Can't put my finger on it.  I LOVE black beans and LOVE Mexican themed dishes, so I was excited to be making it.  Was a little disappointing.

I haven't been on the Allrecipes website in years and in the past few weeks I have made a few of the vegan recipes and they are awesome, including this one. We ate it like a hearty soup and did not add the cornmeal because I could not find Organic cornmeal.  If you know about GMO's, you will only organic when it comes to corn products. Keep the vegan recipes coming peeps!

Quite good! We like our beans very well cooked so I added some vegetable broth to loosen it up and simmered for a while. Also served as a base for vegetarian fajitas, including peppers and onions, so I left the peppers and onions out here. Thanks so much!

meh, it was okay, but I didn't think it was all *that* much better than just refried beans.  (Although lots of refried beans aren't vegan, because they contain lard.)

Excellent when you add Taco Seasoning I blend from this site and fresh salsa. I could just eat these beans as a main dish with rice and I am not even a vegetarian/vegan!

Excellentl  My husband says he prefers it to regular beef tacos.  I followed this recipe exactly as stated.  We served with tomato, lettuce, and sour cream.  It made enough (only 2 eating) that in the days following we have used it for taco pizza and with nachos.  Will definitely make again!

So yummy! I didn't have any cayenne pepper or yellow cornmeal, but it was still delicious.  I added some jalapenos because I love it spicy. Next time I'm going to add more salsa because it was a little dry.

I used red chili beans and these were great on tacos. The consistency was perfect for tacos, not runny at all. Lots of spice. Next time I'll use hot salsa and chop the bell peppers a bit finer.

This was a very tasty alternative to meat filling. Its better than simple beans. Its great also a a side dish or a dip. I did tweak it just a bit to my liking. I added 1 tablespoon cumin, 1/2 tablespoon cayenne and i added more garlic. This came out great. I put my leftovers in the freezer!

We really enjoyed this filling. Easy to make and very good tasting.  I only just two teaspoons of cumin but it was still very flavorful.  Next tome I might omit or cut back on the paprika as it didn't really add much in our opinion.  Thanks for the recipe.  Will make again as we are trying to sub beans in recipes that call for ground beef.  I bet it would be good as a dip too or on nachos.  Thanks!

I tried this at home since we are vegetarians. Slightly changed the recipe from cornmeal to corn and the taste was great. More so, its quick and easy. My sister-in-law and her family were over the other day and they loved it. Thanks for the post.

I honestly think this stuff is better the next day and only then with crunchy taco shells or tortilla chips.  Tried it as a taco filling for soft tacos....no bueno.  However with the taco fixings layered on top (chopped tomatoes, lettuce, sour cream, shredded cheese, avocado, rice), it made a FABULOUS taco salad with tortilla chips.  I'm trying to go vegetarian, so I will probably keep playing with this to see what works.

I've been looking for some good vegetarian recipes and came across this great vegan recipe.  I love black beans and this recipe made them taste amazing.  I put the taco filling in some whole wheat/high fiber taco shells...all the fiber you need to last you for a day (or maybe even two)!

This is a great recipe! I actually used it as a filling in enchilladas, as well as using it as a bean dip at a party simply by adding back in some of the drained liquid from the beans, mashing coursely and baking it enough to warm it through and serving a dish of homemade salsa along side it. Everyone loved it.

I really liked this. Next time I make it, I'll make a bunch and freeze in individual containers for work lunches. I too added some frozen corn, some chopped tomatoes, shredded carrots, and a bunch of hot sauce. Didn't have any salsa, but pasta sauce combined with hot sauce and a few hot pickled peppers did the trick! A very great base for expanding and adding all your favorite things. I had them rolled up burrito style in a whole wheat flour tortilla. I had no lettuce, no cheese, no nothing (!) to put on it for dressing, and I still loved it. Thanks for a fast, healthy, delicious meal that's sure to become a staple in my house!

This was pretty good.  I am trying to eat healthier and I love Mexican food. I aslo like meat...but I decide to try this and it totally helped my Mexican food cravings.  I topped it with light sour cream and low fat cheese and salsa and ate it with soft tortilla shells.  It turned out pretty good.

My Husband and I both really like this recipe! The only thing I changed was to add a couple of Tablespoons of vegetable stock when I added the mashed beans to keep it moist. Served it on whole wheat tortillas with shredded cheese and more salsa. I will definately make it again.

This is very good!  I added a habanero pepper to it to make it spicier though.

Made this the other night and my roommates and I loved it!  The cornmeal was an interesting addition.  Used sour cream, lettuce, shredded chedder cheese, and put salsa out as well.  Definate do again!

I thought this was really tasty.  Next time, I would use a bit less cumin, and I love cumin.  I added some Adobo for the salt content.  I didn't have any cornmeal, so I omitted it.

This dish was easy to make and delicious. I added lettuce, tomato, cilantro, and cheese as toppings in heated taco shells. This is going into our standard rotation. The leftovers could be a good side dish, too.

Next time I would cut the spices in half as even my spice loving teen thought this very spicy. I cooled it off with a lot of lettuce and tofutti sour cream.  I will make again, just reduce the spices, maybe add corn for color, and use retried beans as another reviewer suggested to reduce labor. Thank you for helping us venture into veganism.

easy to make and very tasty. I didn't have quite as much bell pepper as it called for so I just added a tiny bit more of my chunky salsa and that worked well.

I followed the recipe exactly except doubling or triple the garlic (as I always do). It was delicious!  I will make it again for sure.  I felt healthier eating it than some soy crumbles or something.  I put it in Old El Paso corn tortillas (hard shell from a box), a copycat version (thank you Chef Pablo) of Rubios picante salsa, shredded lettuce and homemade Avocado Crema.  Delicious thank you.

This was really good and super easy to make- my friend's loved it!!  I doubled the recipe for a party, we used 1 large sweet onion and 1 large bell pepper.  I mashed 2 cans of rinsed, drained black beans and left 2 cans of rinsed, drained black beans whole.  I eliminated the cornmeal completely.  I used a jarred salsa and also added a couple tsp of salt- as my guests told me it was kind of bland.  I served it on crunchy pre-made tostada shells with a taco bar of assorted toppings- shredded lettuce, avocado, salsa, cilantro, onion, tomatoes, etc.

I would give this a 4.5 if they allowed me to, but can’t give half stars.  I would cut the chili powder to half a teaspoon, it was just too much for me (although I like spice) and the children.  But otherwise it was super yummy.

I wanted a non-meat filling for a taco ring that I was making. It did great for this purpose and I will make it again but next time I will either add some other things like corn, mushrooms  and reduce the cayenne. I love spicy but this was just a little too much!

I loved this dish.  I added jalapenos, mushrooms and cilantro mixed in with the black bean mash.  I like spicy so I used more cumin, cayenne, paprika and chili powder.  I made tortilla bowls (toasted them on broil in oven, must watch so you don't burn them) and served everything in the bowl topped with cheese, sour cream and spicy guacamole. #yummy

Since it was just the two of us I used one can of beans and adjusted accordingly. Very, very easy to make and my husband loved it. And we are not vegetarian or vegan.

Everything was good. We used hard shells to balance the texture. I would have just cut back on the chili powder next time. It's really spicy!

I forgot to get cayenne but thats ok...I added a tablespoon of chopped jalapeño instead.  I used a mild southwest salsa.  I also added 5 chopped artichoke hearts and about 1/4 cup of the artichoke juice because I had to serve it the next day and I know how the beand like moisture!
I added a teaspoon of salt & about 4 dashes of pepper to balance the flavors.

I finally made this myself for at first time today, after I tasted it at a friends house. I used red kidney beans instead of black beans. It was really easy to make, it came out great and everybody in my family liked it. 
I served it with homemade corn tortillas, salad, garlic dressing, cheese and some diced, grilled pepper. 
(I'm not a vegetarian myself and I did not miss meat at all.)

We liked this. We used a hot salsa which was really good for the recipe. Next time we will try hot sauce, such as Cholulaa or Frank's, instead because our chunky salsa was challenging in a texture sense.

This was delish!!  Like others, I only mashed 1 can beans.  Added 1 can corn, and slightly toned down the spices.  Served with tortillas, diced tomatoes, salsa, and cheese.  Next time I'll do guac but was out today.  Looking forward to leftovers....

This was pretty good!  My Husband and I enjoyed these for a few days because it made a good amount for only two people.  I think next time I will add more spices, it wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked.  It was probably due to the fact that my husband won't eat onion so I left that out.  I will for sure be making this again!

As a matter of personal tastes, we would use a little less pepper flakes next time...a hint too spicy for us. We also thought we might try mixing pinto beans with the black beans, simply because they seem to absorb flavors more readily...but tasty as is.

great. I used about half of a bag of dry black beans and just threw everything into my crock pot on high for about 6  hours.  drained out the excess water and then mashed.  delicious.

This recipe is DELICIOUS! First off, DON'T JUDGE ME! I didn't add the salsa, but not by choice.. Hubs ate all of the salsa without telling me and when I went to make this for his lunch I realized he already beat me to it. This turned out so well, I just know it would be even better with salsa. It was dry without so I had to add some water. Anyway - I had some taco seasoning from Trader Joe's so I subbed that for the spices. Same ingredients. I used this "filling" as a topping for tostadas. I didn't miss the cheese or meat and hubs gave it a 9/10. I'm so happy I made this over the black bean quesadillas. It was perfect and very satisfying. Thank you so much!

I think this was a good starting point. I added hot sauce instead of the dry cayenne; green chiles with their juice instead of salsa; then served on whole wheat tortilla with lettuce, onion, tomato. Wish I had a lime handy, I think that would have been a good finishing touch.

I saw this and decided to give it a try.  I omitted the cornmeal, because I'd never use the rest of it for anything and couldn't see a need for it.  I also decided to leave the salsa out but add taco sauce and fresh tomato chunks when serving, and that worked well.  I wasn't sure how spicy this was if made by the recipe, so was a little more conservative with the spices; next time I will use more.  This was great and healthy and easy; it's also a good base to experiment with, I will make it again.

I did make a couple adjustments just because I can't do spicy! I didn't use cumin or cayenne and just stuck with the 1 tsp each of paprika and chili powder. I also did not use the cornmeal since I didn't have any. I made fresh salsa instead of store bought. We made burritos and I put some homemade guac on top of my beans before rolling it up. It was really good. My daughter said she doesn't like black beans, but ate the whole thing. She did say it tasted so much better the next day!

I made this last night with what I had on hand; red kidney beans instead of black beans (which are HARD to find in France!!), no cornmeal or bell pepper. It was delicious, though a tad too spicy for this family, so I will tone it down the next time, and there will be a next time!

I used 1 tsp cumin, 1 tsp chili powder, 1 tsp paprika and a scant 1/4 tsp cayenne and it came out tasting just right to me.  I much prefer this to fake burgher crumbles with taco seasoning.

Excellent exactly as written.  The spice combination is very flavorful. I made this with pinto beans since my husband doesn't like black beans, and it turned out great. I served it on crunchy taco shells, topped w/avacado and tomato

I absolutely love this recipe and I've made it three times now in  the past month! The last time I made it I didn't have cornmeal, so I used flour instead, and it turned out just as good as the other two times. I did learn that I enjoy it more if I chop the peppers into smaller pieces as opposed to larger. I have also recommended this recipe to all of my Veg friends; it's certainly a keeper!

This was so easy to make and absolutely delicious. I used red kidney beans instead of black beans and didn't fully mash them. I also used only half the cayenne pepper and chilli powder. Served with chopped tomato and mashed avocado in hard taco shells. Can't wait to have the leftovers tomorrow.

I scaled this recipe down and it still made enough for four big burritos (or two lunches and two dinners for this happy girl!) I kept the veggies doubled (1 whole onion, 1 whole pepper) but halved everything else. It was delicious with salsa and fresh avocado.

This was very tasty and easy. I used refried beans instead of black beans because I had that on hand, but I had to increase the spices a bit. I added a few shakes of garlic powder as well. Excellent with sour cream and salsa, lettuce, and guacamole.

Delicious!  There was only two of us, so I only used one can of beans, added a little hot sauce, and left out the peppers because I was feeling lazy.  And it was really good!  My husband and I each had 3 tacos and no leftovers!

This was very good.  The only thing I changed was I added some salt and I used mild Tabasco instead of the cayenne.  My whole family loved it! I think we will make this often. We're not vegetarians, but it's healthier and cheaper.

I'm eating this as we speak, and let me tell you -- it is DELICIOUS.  I left out the bell pepper and otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Perfect blend of spices.  I'm eating this on warmed corn tortillas with lettuce and chopped tomato, and it's just great!

I made this by the recipe, except I replaced the seasoning with a packet of taco seasoning. This is pretty good stuff. Filling. I put it on nacho chips and added cheese. Probably could use some sour cream. Not better than a meat version (I'm a carnivore) but it's a nice alternative.

This was good- I would make it again.  I cut the recipe in half and used it on tostadas.  I didn't have salsa, so I chopped a tomato and added lime juice.  We topped our tostadas with cheddar, sour cream, avocado, lettuce and tomato.  Really good!  I want to try this with tacos too.

This is a really tasty filling!  I use soft flour tortillas and make little burritos.

Loved it. Added a bit of water, because it looked a little dry for my liking, but the flavor is fantastic!
