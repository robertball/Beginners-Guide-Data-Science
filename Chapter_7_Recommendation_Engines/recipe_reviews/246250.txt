This was so easy to make and we LOVED it.  The flavors play well together.  We used ground turkey and it was wonderful.  Thanks for sharing your family favorite!!!

Loved this, served it on white rice, added plenty of tomato----very tasty and something a bit different, and soooo easy to make. I made it in the morning so the flavors had a chance to blend.

Delicious. I loved the warmth of the Masala Curry with the beef and coconut.It was quick and easy to make too.  I liked it so much that I made Empanadas with the filling. Wow that's so good!

Really nice recipe!!!...I cut the amount of paprika and chili power. You can really say it's an Indian recipe, the flavors are authentic.

My husband, son and I liked this! The spices in this season the ground beef nicely, and give it a warmth of flavor. We served this over Jasmine rice with naan bread on the side. Quick and easy to prepare as well.

Easy and tasty! The coconut adds another dimension of flavor; kind of ying and yang of salty and sweet. I served this over rice. Next time, I will greatly reduce or even eliminate the salt. Super salty!

I forgot to add the coconut (Unfortunate, since I'd gone all the way to the store to pick some up!), and being a garlic fan I added a second clove of garlic.

But this recipe - as written - turned out fabulously! I had to share some with my neighbor, who loved it as well. 

Kudos and thank you for sharing this masterpiece! 

I loved it!

This is really good. I did make a couple changes after reading numerous recipes online. I added some canned diced potatoes, about 1/2 tsp turmeric, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and I didn't have any coconut. Also I used canned diced tomatoes because I didn't have any whole tomatoes. Still really good. For my kids I added some sour cream just to their individual portions just to mellow out the taste.  It added a nice creaminess and my kids loved it. served over white rice.  Will definitely be making this again. It was super easy for a fast week night meal.
