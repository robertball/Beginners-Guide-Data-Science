I had to make a dip recipe for my Spanish class "food day" and this recipe is amazing! The only thing I changed was I added an extra half bag of shredded sharp cheddar and replaced the blue cheese dressing with ranch dressing. This was perhaps the best dip I have ever eaten.

This dip is fantastic and you can change the level of spice with the hot sauce depending on your taste.  The only thing I did differently was add a little shredded cheddar cheese to the mix and topped it with the remaining cheese with about 20 mins to go in the slow cooker.  This is a must have!

I really enjoyed this dip which is like one I've ordered at a local restaurant. I know people are sensitive to those of us who make changes but I felt my substitution of cheddar for the blue cheese was necessary as my husband is not a blue cheese lover. I thought it would be too much for him in addition to the blue cheese dressing and I had seen other recipes that used cheddar. I also added some spring onion after it was heated and thought that really added a nice flavor. One thing I noticed was that the hot sauce did not blend in well for me and there were places with pools of it. But it tasted great anyway. I will definitely make this again.

You really can adjust it a lot and it will turn out fine. I have never used blue cheese just because I've never bought it, but my friends make it with blue cheese and it is just as great, so I think you'll really love it however you do it! ranch defiantly makes it not as hot so if you don't like it as hot,  I would recommend using a little more of it.

What I LOVE with this dip is that it doesn't turn out greasy. All the others that I've made have you add shredded cheese and while I love cheese, the grease makes it less than appetizing to me. This one is great !

If prepared according to recipe, the blue cheese overwhelms the dish.  Should use more Ranch dressing than the recipe calls for.

I made this for a company Christmas party. It was a hit!! I didn't quite use the ingredients to exact measurements, but it still came out great. I recommend using the hot sauce to taste. Some like it tangy and spicy, while others not so much. Bottom line: great recipe. It's only the day after and I'm already being asked to make it again!

Great recipe! You can adjust the hot sauce to your  taste. It makes a lot of dip, so next time I will cut recipe in half.

Great dip! I used Vietnamese hot sauce instead of the hot sauce called for.  I would suggest shredding the chicken rather than cubing but does not affect the taste. Thanks for the recipe.

How can something so simple to make be so delicious? Like many reviewers,  I substituted sharp cheddar for the blue cheese crumbles and used only ranch dressing.  My brother-in-law requests it every time he comes over.

This is the best buffalo chicken dip I've ever made, and is one I use consistently for pot lucks and parties- to rave reviews (if only they knew how easy it is to make!). I love bleu cheese, so this recipe really blends the flavors well and provides that missing piece that most buffalo dips lack. 

There are some tweaks in how I make it. Mainly just personal preference.

1. I shred the chicken instead of dicing it. this makes it easier to dip
2. I don't add any Ranch dressing. Honestly, it's not really needed. 
3. I use a little less hot sauce because of my youngest can't stand it too spicy. 

Otherwise, the recipe is straightforward and easy. Definitely worth a try.

She's right... this is the best Buffalo Dip out there!   Its the perfect blend of all the ingredients mixed together to make your belly smile!!  

It wasn't too hot at all for any of us here ..... and if you don't like it spicy, just add less of the Hot Sauce!   I did shred my chicken into smaller pieces than just diced. 

Great Dip for Holidays, Televised Sports Parties and just because !! 

Very easy to make! Give it a try!!!

Best recipe for buff dip! Everyone asks me to make it for parties!  I bake in 350 oven for 20- 30 min with cheddar cheese on top and it's perfect and bubbly.

Simple, delicious, lots of compliments, even from the vegetarian who broke their diet in order to try this out. I would recommend doubling or tripling the recipe though--- it goes VERY fast.

Not a big ranch fan, so I omit the ranch. It's still great!
