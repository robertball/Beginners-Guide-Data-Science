I'm in love with this drink! So simple to make and absolutely decadent! I used SF Torani raspberry syrup, and Torani dark chocolate syrup (think ice cream topping not liquid). The only change was to use real whipping cream. 
This is a coffee drink anyone would be glad to serve a guest!

Rich and decadent, we loved this one. Reminded me of a dark chocolate raspberry truffle from Godiva. YUM! This Allstar has been compensated for participation in the Allrecipes Allstar Program.

I liked the whipped topping in this drink--it made for a frothy and creamy treat. I'm not real fond of raspberry syrup, so I used strawberry instead, and it was good in this. This is a very decadent and sweet drink, a little too sweet for me as written. I only used 1 T of each syrup, and it was still very sweet. It was yummy though, and I drank the whole thing down before I knew it! *This Allstar has been compensated for participation in the Allrecipes Allstar Program.

Oh - My - Word! This is delicious! I'm having myself a little "Afternoon Delight" with this Whipped Raspberry Delight!  I didn't want to buy an entire bottle of Torani raspberry syrup (not knowing how this was going to turn out), so I made the "Raspberry Syrup for Drinks" recipe (also on this site). The combination of flavors just works so well. I loved it! This Allstar has been compensated for participation in the Allrecipes Allstar Program.

This recipe came together well and the flavors were so spot on that I was kinda blown away by the first sip! It is liquidy, so you can easily pour this over ice or blend it with ice with you prefer a frappe style drink. I made my drink to hot fudge sauce and fresh raspberry syrup using the "Raspberry Syrup for Drinks" recipe also on AllRecipes. I will definitely be making this again!This Allstar has been compensated for participation in the Allrecipes Allstar Program.
