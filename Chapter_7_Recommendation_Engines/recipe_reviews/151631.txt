This was great! Instead of sweet sausage, I used hot. I used a better jarred pasta than prego. Classico four cheese. And instead of spaghetti noodles I used frozen cheese raviolis. This will work great with any jarred pasta sauce and any pasta. SO GOOD!

This was a quick and easy recipe.  We used turkey sausage instead of pork.  Some Italian seasoning and elbow noodles.  Everyone enjoyed it.  From 34 to 2 it works.

This was very tasty - even without the olives. My kids loved it!

This was okay.  It was a little bland.  More vegetables would have helped.  It almost tasted like a hamburger helper-type meal.
