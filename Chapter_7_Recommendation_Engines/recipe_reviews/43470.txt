We made this punch for my mother's 85th birthday party. Everyone loved it! We mixed everything up the day before and just added the 7up as we put each batch in the punch bowl. We also froze some of the punch with sliced oranges and cherries to make ice rings and keep the punch from diluting instead of using ice.

I gave this 4 stars instead of 5, because I personally didn't care for the taste of this punch. However, I had made it for a ladies tea and everyone(except me) loved it. It was almost all gone and I had doubled the recipe.
