Delish!  Wonderful, full of flavor and not too sweet.  I did forget the sesame seeds as a garnish - oh well, nobody noticed.  I also did not re-use the marinade but made up a separate batch with the additional ingredients, rice vinegar and sambal etc.  for the glaze / sauce.  It worked well for us. Very nice flavor combination.  Thank you.

This turned out very good and very tender.  My husband always says he doesn't like lamb, so I didn't tell him until after he got done gobbling it up.  He loved it!

This didn't turn out for me. I used pork rib tips and the marinade coagulated and solidified when I tried to simmer it down so I had to throw it out. (I always have this problem and will in the future avoid recipes that call for used marinade to be boiled down for later use that I ended up just using the pan drippings and the rest of the ingredients. It turned out rather bland. I love Chef Johns recipes and was looking forward to another hit. I gave 5 stars because I did sub pork for lamb and maybe this was my mistake??

Just amazing! I added some ginger, 1/2 cup sugar, and 1tablespoon soy sauce to the glaze. It was out of this world tender.

John, OMG this ranks right up there with those Clifton Springs Garlic Chicken Wings which we make on a regular basis now. We made these ribs as directed using baby back ribs and the results were incredible. Very tender and tasty; not to sweet. They say good things take time and this recipe is no exception to that rule. Take the time to prepare these as the recipe requires and you won't be disappointed. Thanks John! Oh, it is worth tracking down the Sambal Oelek; we ordered it on line since we could not find it locally

Made a few changes, used baby back ribs and used ginger ale instead of root beer. Was so good! Made sesame noodles to go with it

Very spicy but excellent flavor that stays with you into the night. Lamb ribs were $18.99/LB so I used St. Louis Ribs instead. Had to cook 3 hrs. instead of 2 because lamb ribs are tiny compared to pork ribs. Can't wait for leftovers!

The flavor was fantastic. I have never made ribs before and as I followed the directions, I figured out that you baste, cook 5 mins, flip them, baste, cook 5 mins and keep repeating. If you don't keep alternating the side on top, the underside looks.. like meat, not that nicely browned rib look. 
I gave this 4 stars because the glaze took 30 mins to reduce. It still never reduced as much as the recipe says. I really enjoyed this recipe and will make it again, but next time, I'll start reducing the reserved sauce an hour and a half into cook time.

Spectacular!  
I substituted ginger ale for root beer because it was easier to find, and I also substituted harissa for the sambal oelek. Harissa is a Northern African spice that's a little lower in heat than sambal oelek.  Oh. And I also used 1/4 cup finely chopped shallot, because I didn't have chopped green onion.
     I think one of the keys here is the toasted sesame oil. I live in Asia and I know there is a big difference between sesame oil and toasted sesame oil.   I also didn't get too wacky about sealing the ribs in a foil packet -- I kept ripping the foil on the bones. I used a deep rimmed pan and placed the marinated ribs on it, covered them with parchment then sealed the pan with aluminum foil.  Clean up was not a huge issue.     I forgot to take a photo as they came out of the oven, but I got one of two rib portion as we ate them for dinner.  Look for the hand holding the ribs.     I will definitely make these again. I might try the marinade with pork or chicken as well.

It was a lot of effort that I think could have been better spent on lamb chops. I thought the sauce was tasty but also greasy and wouldn’t really consider the sauce a “glaze” as although it cooked down, it didn't thicken.  Turning up the heat to 450 caused a lot of smoke in the oven/house!   I’ll stick with lamb chops and mint jelly in the long run.

I did not care for this recipe. All I could taste in the marinade was seasame oil and heat.
