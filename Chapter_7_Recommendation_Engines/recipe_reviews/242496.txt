This was so good! My end product was pretty soupy though. Next time, I will cook the rice and veggies first, then I'll combine everything and baked until the cheese is bubbly. I added some extra seasoning too and served this with hot sauce. Everyone loved it!

My kids loved this dish!  They asked for me to make it every night.  It's a winner in our home.  The recipe has some great ingredients but I made some modifications that I think improved the final product.  I sauteed the chicken in some olive oil and then simmered with the veggies and chicken broth for about 15 min.  I combined the chicken, veggies and broth with the rice  and soup mixture and only cooked it for 45 min (covered).  Added cheese and cooked uncovered for 10 more minutes.  Based on one other reviewers comments, I decreased the amount of chicken broth to 1 and 3/4 cup and added an extra half cup of brown rice.  I did not want a soupy mixture and these changes made the perfect casserole combination.

This recipe is a winner! I made a few changes (because I can't seem to just follow a recipe as is): I added 2 cans of low sodium chicken broth and an extra cup of brown rice. I also threw in a Tbsp of minced garlic as I cooked the chicken. I was impatient and didn't want to wait the hour and a half for this to bake, so I added some of the broth and the veggies to the skillet with my chicken to heat everything up and start cooking. I also let the rice soak with the soup and broth while I was cooking the chicken. I added a Tbsp of cream cheese as well to make it a little bit more creamy. Baked it in a 10x14 and plan to eat the leftovers for lunch this week.

Awesome! I added extra of all veggies (plus celery and broccoli) and used less chicken broth since a lot of reviews said it was soupy. I also added another cup of rice. This was my husbands favorite, he requested I make it often! Very delicious.

Too many peas in my opinion they overpowered everything.  But then again, I forgot the spinach.  My 6 year old says it's a keeper.
