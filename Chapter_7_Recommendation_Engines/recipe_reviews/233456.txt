How often do you get the chance to try an Egyptian recipe?! I had to try it! I had Farmer's Market green beans to use . My daughter & husband & I really liked this. My daughter even put it in her lunch tomorrow. I had cardamom seeds & used our mortar & pestle to crush them.

Egyptian Green Beans w/ Carrots Haiku: "I thought these were great, but leftover tasted weird. So easy to make!" 1st, I've never seen  frozen blend of green beans and carrots, so I used frozen green beans and 1/2 c. baby carrots that I quartered so they would cook evenly. I don't quite understand the main photograph for this recipe as it appears to have feta, butternut squash (?) and mushrooms (?) in it. Other than the fresh to frozen carrot switcherroooo, I was faithful to the recipe. I thought this was a tasty and new way to eat our green beans, but b/c they weren't very good reheated the next day, I would reduce the servings next go-around so that there weren't any leftovers.
