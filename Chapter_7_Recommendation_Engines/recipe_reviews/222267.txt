It sounded like a good idea, but too many things went wrong for me... like, I never noticed that it called for a "1 oz." pkg. of vanilla pudding mix. OK. I'm not sure if that is supposed to be 3.5 oz or 6 oz. pkg. The whole microwave process didn't work for me. I ended up having to cook the rhubarb on the stove. It might taste OK, but for something that is supposed to be simple, I'd rather have it work right the first time without dirtying so many dishes trying to get it to just work.

I'll start by saying the taste is great.  The problem I had was with the directions.  I wound up with strawberry rhubarb soup in a graham cracker pie crust.  I cooked the rhubarb with the Jello in the microwave with 2 cups of water as stated on the Jello package.  Should I have used only 1 cup of water...or no water?  Also, I used the Keebler extra large (10") graham cracker pie crust and had too much filling.  I would really appreciate clarification on the jello - water ratio as the pie is really tasty and I would make it again with an adjusted recipe.

YUMMY!!  Cooked my rhubarb and gelatin on the stove.  If you use 2 cups of sliced strawberries the rhubarb filling will not fit in the store bought graham cracker crust.  Will make my own crust next time so can use the 2 cups of sliced strawberries.
