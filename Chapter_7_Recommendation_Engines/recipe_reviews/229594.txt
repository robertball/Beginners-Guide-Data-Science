After looking at hundreds of recipes, I decided to try this one.  After I made a pie with this recipe, I promptly went to the store to buy several more fresh pie pumpkins to cook, puree and freeze so that I could enjoy this pie whenever I wanted.  It is unlike any other pumpkin pie.  The MOST DELICIOUS pumpkin pie I've ever eaten!  Thank you so very much for sharing this awesome recipe!

I was in search of a recipe for real pumpkin pie...no canned pumpkin or milk involved.  This recipe delivered big time!  I loved the use of heavy cream and sour cream rather than the typical evaporated milk component; the texture of this pie was sublimely silky and rich.  I halved this recipe for one pie and reduced the sugar by half again and it was plenty sweet enough for us.  This WILL be my go-to pumpkin pie recipe forevermore.  I used pumpkin purée that I roasted, puréed and froze previously so this recipe didn't really take much time to make at all.

All at Thanksgiving agreed, this is the BEST pumpkin pie we've ever tasted!  I made half the recipe, and made it gluten-free by using a GF crust and omitting the flour.  I used half the amount of sugar (so 1/2 c. for one pie) and substituted dark muscovado for the demerara, which gave it a richer flavor.  (You could use a high-quality dark brown sugar.)  I baked it in a 9" tart pan at 425 degrees for 20 minutes, then lowered the oven temp to 375 and baked another 25 minutes.  Planning to make another using light sour cream.  I agree with the others--will never use canned pumpkin again!

This recipe is easy and straightforward, you only used one prep bowl to mix everything. I used baked butternut squash pulp. Made only one pie and used only 1/2 cup of palm sugar. It was still sweet, probably because the squash was sweet itself. So please try with less sugar than the recipe suggests, you would save lot of carbs.

Everyone raved about this recipe. I cut it in half to make one pie and only used 3/4c sugar. I was discouraged that there was no amount listed for the pumpkin (my sugar pumpkins were rather large) and ended up using ~2.5 c of puréed pumpkin.  It came out great!

This pie was great!  The texture and consistency were wonderful.  I didn't change a thing and everyone at the party raved about it.  I also made mini muffin tin pies with this filling and all but 2 of the children out of a class of 24 first graders ate them!

Absolutely Amazing!!!  I followed the recipe to the letter.  I have been making pumpkin pie for 20+ years and have always been proud with how much everyone loves "my" pies.  However, I was looking for a new recipe to try (one that didn't use canned pumpkin OR sweetened condensed milk) with a new flavor and this one was it.  I believe it is better than my previous recipe.
When I served this pie one of my guests told me it was the best pumpkin pie she had ever had.  I have to agree with her.  I will make this a few time more to make sure I've got it down to a "T" and then I will be submitting it into a local pie contest.
My sugar pumpkin yielded 2 1/4 c. pulp.  I did have more filling than my pie dish would hold so I cooked the rest of the filling in a ramekin - delish.

This was absolutely the most delicious pumpkin pie we have ever tasted.  I followed the recipe exactly and would not change a thing.  It came out perfectly cooked, silky and very flavourful.  I served it with dollops of fresh country whipped cream.

Excellent recipe. The texture and taste of the filling was great. Next time I'll cover the edges of the pie during the last 10 minutes and chill the pie completely before slicing into it. This is my new go to recipe for fresh pumpkin pie!

This was a really delicious recipe for scratch pumpkin pie. I halved the recipe and also cut back the sugar to about 3/4 cup. Only difference was my pumpkin took far longer to become tender than stated when roasting. I also put the pumpkin in the food processor and pulsed it until smooth after cooking and prior to adding other ingredients. Then simply added the remaining ingredients and pulsed it a few times to mix. Easy peezy. Into the thawed shell. It did get a tiny bit browner than I would have liked, when custard was not completely set.

I will definitely make this pie again. Everyone  said it was the best Pumpkin pie ever.  I ran the pumpkin through my food processor to make it extra smooth, and added a bit of yellow food coloring the second time I made it. Unfortunately without it, it looked rather pale.

My sugar pumpkin ended up giving me 2 1/3 C puree, which made for the most filling I could have possibly fit in the pie crust without overflowing. I followed the advice of other reviewers and cut the sugar to 3/4 C for one pie BUT it came out less sweet than I would have liked (maybe differences in sugar pumpkins) and next time I would follow the recipe exactly and use the full amount of sugar. 

I'm attaching a pic - I tried to put foil on to keep the edges of the pie crust from getting too brown, but the foil touched the pie and messed up the top. I smoothed it over the best I could. I think next time I will egg wash the cutout in the center of the pie so it gets more color.

I took it out at 45m (mostly because I was distraught at how I had messed up the top of the pie and wanted to try to fix it) but the inside was a little gooey and it could have gone for 10m longer.

First time I have made it. Turned out great. It did take longer to bake than the 45 minutes but no. Big deal. I will definitely make again. P.s. I made my own pumpkin pie spice blend as I had none. Easy and will do that again too

I am going to the store to buy more pie pumpkins. This really is amazing! My dad loves pumpkin pie and has already asked if I am making this for Christmas dinner. My 5 year old wanted seconds! It took about 20 minutes longer to cook the pie than stated but besides that I followed everything exactly. Next time I may use a little less pumpkin in the recipe (my pumpkins yielded almost 6 cups of puree, so I had a little of the mixture left over which I froze). Also, I did cover the crust for the first 40 minutes. I can't wait for everyone else to try my second pie on thanksgiving.

Love This! Really simple and the taste is excellent!
*side note- make sure the fibers of the pumpkin are well blended. I should have put mine in a blender as my hand mixer didn'tcut it.

I used half and half rather than heavy cream, because that’s all I had and it worked just fine. 3/4 cup “sugar in the raw” was plenty for one pie. Everyone thought it was delicious. It was fun roasting the seeds afterwards too!

It turned out great!!  I used a store  purchased graham cracker crust pie crust and raw sugar. for people concerned that it was too sweat, make sure you are not using white granulated sugar.
