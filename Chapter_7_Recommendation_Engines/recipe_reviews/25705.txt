This is very easy and good. I also added a couple of potatoes. I added extra water so it wouldn't dry out and would provide extra gravy.

Overall, this was really good!  I would agree that you would need to AT LEAST double the amounts of water and burgundy.  I covered it tightly, and didn't use too big of a casserole, but it still got dried out (fortunately, it was still good!).  I also added a couple of cut up potatoes.  Next time I will also decrease the meat to maybe 1 or 1 1/2 pounds, and add more veggies.

Ever since I visited Scotland, I've been trying to duplicate the rich, tangy stew I enjoyed there.  This recipe comes very close, and is quite delicious.  I cut way back on the meat and added potatoes in their place.  However, I didn't add more liquid, which is a must or the stew borders on drying out.  Next time I'll double the amount of veggies and triple the amount of liquid!

Holy Cow!  I don't think I am going to make Beef Stew in the crockpot again.  Sooo tasty.  I omitted the celery (hubby doesn't like it) doubled the water and wine (used Merlot)added 1 big can of stewed tomatoes, 4 cloves of garlic finely chopped, a half a bag of frozen green beans and 3 reg size potatoes cut up.  Cooked it 2 1/2 hours then added some cold water/cornstarch mixture to thicken it up a little bit and cooked another 1/2 hour.  FABULOUS!!

Excellent--made according to recipe except tripled the gravy and spices as suggested from another review.  Added mushroom caps and canned new potatoes 1/2 way through cooking time.  Husband would give it 10 stars if he could--11 year old daughter thought it was the best stew she ever tasted.  Served with pumpkin bread IV from this site.

Excellent conmbination of flavors, though 
I must admit I only used this recipe for a base for something of my own creation. I increased the amount of liquid by 3-4 times, keeping the amount of mustard and thyme the same as listed, and it tasted great to me. More thyme would probably have overwhelmed it. Also, instead of putting it in the oven, I cooked mine in the slow cooker after browning the beef on the stovetop. All in all it made for a wonderful meal, my fiance had three helpings! Served with fresh baked black bread from my bread machine.

Very good flavor.  Added an extra 1/2c wine and water, each.  Though it didn't completely dry out, there was very little sauce. Added 8oz of sliced mushrooms and 2 potatoes. Used Pinot Noir wine in place of Burgundy. Will double (at least) the fluids next time, but great otherwise.

This came out great.  My own touches included carmelizing half the onions, adding 3 large cloves of chopped garlic, using enough additional wine & water to cover the meat, and then thickening it towards the end with 2T flour, but those were only touches -- the basic recipe is superb.

This recipe was delicious and very filling. The meat and vegetables turned out to be extremely tender and yummy. I added a lot more water, so it turned out to be a beef soup rather than thick stew, which was fine - I loved it anyway. I also added 2 tbsp. minced garlic, and more servings of the vegetables. Kept it tightly covered in the oven for 2 1/2 hours....didn't need 4 hrs. A little Texas garlic toast was perfect to go with it. My boyfriend had 2 servings. I would've too if I wasn't so full after the first bowl.

This is good stew and a nice change of flavor from our regular old stove-top (but still favorite!) recipe.  Added 4 cloves of garlic for more flavor.  Didn't add (baby) carrots until last 30mins or so of cooking, so they wouldn't turn into mush.  Meat was oh-so tender after 3 hours, no way it neeeded 4.  Liquid was just right and we ate with stroganoff noodles.  Only thing else I would add is some rosemary next time.

This stew is excellent. I cut back to 1 onion due to hubby's taste. I could see it would be short on liquid so did not add potatoes, cooked them separate and mixed in at the end. Checked oven periodically and added more water and stopped cooking by 2 1/2 hours, does not need 4 hours. I will make it again.

I liked this. I read the other reviews and I'd have to say that if the liquid ran out it might be because they did not cover the pan or used a pan that was too large. I used a 9 x 13 pan and it nicely held 2 #s of meat and all the other ingredients. I also used baby carrots. I did not have boullion cubes so I used one can of beef stock in place of 1 cup of water. I also used Merlot wine. I added a bag of frozen peas about 15 min. before it was done. Next time, I'd add some boiled potatoes along with the peas. I'd also add a tsp. of Gravy Master or Kitchen Bouquet for a bit of color as it was a bit "grey." I had to add a bit more thickener in the form of cold water and flour because it did not get thick with the 3 T. of flour. All in all, I liked the flavor and unlike on top of stove cooking with no lid, the flavor of the wine did not seem to evaporate so it was quite tasty. A definite winner.

This is a very good stew recipe, but it needs more liquid.  One way is to add a can of stewed tomatoes, including the juice.  This gives the stew a little more flavor, too.

Would definitely make this part of my regular recipes....my husband loved it!  Tripled the liquid, using both water and wine.  Added potatoes and minced garlic. Also mushrooms the last 30 minutes.  Yummy!

I read other reviews and added twice the liquid. Unless you like a strong tangy stew, I would not put so much wine in, actually I would possibly put in only half a cup. I replaced the Tyme with a 1/2 tsp of Allspice. I added about 6 to 7 small red potatoes cut in quarters and a few cherry tomatoes. Very easy recipie and would try this again with a few changes.

Husband rated a 4, but I'd only give it a 1, so it got a 3. Will not make again. I prefer "traditional" stew better. Left an unpleasant taste in the mouth.

I loved this stew! The only reason I gave it 4 stars was that it was pretty salty and I love salt. That may have been because I used cooking wine.  Thanks, though, this is a keeper.

This is the best stew I've ever made and my husband definitely wants it back on our dinner table!  I recommend doubling the recipie if you plan on feeding more than three people though.  Also, I used a tbls. of prepared mustard in lieu of dry mustard and added 1 cubed baking potato.  Next time I will add peas, too.

This recipe is excellent.  The beef was tender and moist, and the veggies too.  I had to add a bit more water and Gravy thickener because I increased the size of the stew.  This is a definite repeat recipe!

This was good but I just left the stew on the stove instead of putting it in the oven (one less pan to wash) :).  Maybe I'll put it in the oven next time...  I also was out of thyme.  I added one more cup water but probably only needed half a cup as I guess the water doesn't evaporate on top of the stove as much as it does in the oven.  I also used dried low sodium beef bouillion which seemed to be fine.  Finally I used red cooking wine instead of burgundy.  I guess I did change the recipe but it still had a richer taste from the wine and was a change from just using beef bouillion or having a tomato base in stew.

I follewed the recipe exactly, other that cooking in in a crock pot on low all day.  It smelled wonderful, and tasted very good too.  Thanks for an easy and delicious recipe.  Will make again.

Good, but not as great as I expected from previous claims.  It needs to be served over broad noodles or add quartered potatoes. Sort of a  bland flavor, so we added Tobasco & Worcestirshire sauce. I would make it again, but would likely add some garlic as well.

Tasted great except all the water simmered away long before the 4 hrs was up and it turned out very salty and dry.  With more water I think it would have tasted great.

mmm, yummy!! I love this recipe just as it is, but after reading some of the reviews I may follow some of the ideas (a little more liquid, add potatoes, mushrooms, onion) I used baby carrots to cut down on chopping. This recipe freezes well.

very good.I used baby carrots,and two bunches of green onions next time i will cut my celery in to large chunks.I would also add a large package of fresh whole mushrooms. I agree and im so glad that i doubled the wine & water and beef boul. base, which i used instead of the boul. cubes.  All & all it was a great meal.

This was very good, much like what I usually make except the wine gave it a unique flavor.  I added turnip, potatoes, mushrooms and pearl onions.  I also doubled the water and wine.  I can't believe this recipe doesn't call for garlic and I can't believe I forgot to add it, oh well, next time.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This is a very good stew with a different flavor due to the mustard and the wine.  I found it was melt in your mouth tender after 3 hours.  I added potatoes and mushrooms and doubled the liquid.  My family loves a lot of gravy.

This stew is excellent.  Even my 12 year old son who is pretty picky loved it!  I left out the celery and added potatoes and fresh mushrooms.  The wine really adds a wonderful flavor.  This was a hit!

Used 2.5 cups liquid (beef stock and red wine, in equal amounts), skipped the bouillon cubes, and increased the spices by about a third. Braised in a tightly lidded Dutch oven and did not need to add more liquid. Also, waited to add the cornstarch (instead of flour, due to gluten sensitivity of a dinner guest) until last hour. Also added 4 smallish potatoes then. Came out great, with plenty of gravy. 4 stars as written, 5 with (slight)modifications.

We did not care for the taste of  this at all. Loved the easy oven prep. but took less then 2 hours certainly not 4. Also  needed a lot more liquid, used beef broth instead of bouilln and water and used 2-1/2 cups, maybe thats why it didn't taste good, or maybe it was the wine I used {merlot] but will stick to traditional stew recipes and use the wine in other recipes. Will defintely use the oven method again, just with a another recipe.
