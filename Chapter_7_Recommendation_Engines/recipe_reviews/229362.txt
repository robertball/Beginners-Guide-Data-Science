You'll notice that no salt or pepper is included in the directions, and it needs some.  It could be that a store-bought ranch dressing would have had enough, but I made Low Fat Buttermilk Ranch Dressing from this site, and it did not contain as much salt as the other would have.  Still this is really good and would definitely be something to take to a potluck gathering!  It would be especially good with BBQ-type food.  I love raw corn that is mixed with ingredients like this.  I will make this again!  Thanks!

This recipe was absolutely delicious!!! I didn't add the celery because I don't like it, but it was still great. Everyone enjoyed it and can't wait for me to make more.

It was delicious! As previously mentioned though, it did need salt and pepper but other than that, it was perfect.

It should be called "Corn-fetti."  I made this as a side for a BBQ dinner last night.  My boyfriend absolutely LOVED it and thought I bought it at the store.  I added some Frank's Red Hot Sauce and some green hot sauce to the ranch before mixing it in, plus some red pepper flakes to spice it up a little bit.  It was delicious!!!  So easy too.

We liked it.  Something a little different for a side.

This is a stand-by for covered dish lunches at my house church. I generally have the ingredients on hand and it can be thrown together in a few minutes using pre-chopped veggies from the supermarket and canned corn.

Very nice and easy fresh side salad.  I used a combination of fresh parsley, thyme, and basil (we don't like cilantro) plus a bit of garlic salt and pepper to ramp up the ranch flavor.
