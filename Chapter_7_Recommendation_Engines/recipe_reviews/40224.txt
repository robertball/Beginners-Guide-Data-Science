My company really enjoyed this recipe.  The only suggestion is maybe add more vegetables than what is called for as everyone liked the sauce but there wasn't that much to go around.

I thought this dish was delicious. My husband said he would teek it next time but he tweeks every recipe. It was very easy to prepare, very tasty and I felt healthy with the carrot and tomato. I made some taboulleh to go with it.

I made this recipe for my family and they all loved it, even my teenage daughter.  I will make it in the future when I have special guests for dinner.

easy to make - lacks some flavor, but captures a nice Indian flavor without the hot spices

Really loved this recipe.  I like a lot of veggies, so I added some sweet potato and sliced peppers, used a can of diced tomatoes (for the chopped tomatoes) and added some extra water.  Served it with couscous and it was perfect!  Next time I'll add some cauliflower.

Like most "Indian style" recipes I've tried here, this dish lacked a real authentic taste. However, with a few changes (more spices, doubling the sauce, a pinch of brown sugar), it turned out to be a quick and different weeknight fix. Will probably make again.

This was really good and very easy.  I wouldn't change anything.  This dish really grew on me the more I ate it.  I wasn't sure about the first couple of bites, but by the time I was finished, I was hooked.  Will definitely make again.

This was pretty good..a three star on my rating scale. I went with a few minor substitutions. I only had canned stewed tomatoes so I used those instead of fresh. I also added some zucchini that I needed to use up. If I make it again I will probably use chicken thighs. White meat seems to dry out when cooked for a long time. Otherwise not bad for a quick easy meal!

Easy to make.  Felt it needed "something" as my husband thought it needed salt.  I served it with steamed rice but maybe next time will try couscous for something different and to get the flavors going.

Overall, a great recipe, very tasty. I used about 2 cups of water and added cubed potatoes to the recipe and it turned out great.

Surprisingly good much better than I expected. The name is apt: it isn't anything like you'd get at an Indian restaurant but the flavor is fairly Indian-style. Like other reviewers the dish grew on me as I ate it. And leftovers were even better probably because the flavors coalesced overnight. One suggestion/warning: the recipe calls for 2-4 minutes of cooking the sauce uncovered at the end to reduce make it less liquidy. I had to do this for 30 minutes or so to get it more stew-like and appropriate for spooning over the chicken. So plan on this extra time.
