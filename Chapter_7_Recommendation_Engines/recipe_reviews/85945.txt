This was good, fast and easy. I used two 14oz cans of tomato sauce and diced tomatoes because I did not have puree on hand and the texture was great.

I used the variation given by the last review, 2 14oz cans tomato sauce and one can diced tomatoes instead of the puree. It Was EXCELLENT!!

This was absolutely delicious!  It is very similar to the tomato basil soup you get at La Madeleine which I love.  I used the 1 can of diced and 2 of sauce and when it was almost ready I used a hand blender to mash the diced tomatoes up a bit more.  It turned out thick and hearty and the flavor was amazing!

Fantastic!  Quick, easy, and delicious!  I too used the sauce/diced variation and it came out fabulously!

I made the soup but not the sandwich.  The soup is great.  I cut down on the amount of cream cheese and left out the milk entirely.  Very good.

A wonderful recipe! I made this for my co-op of 30 people, and it went over just wonderfully. It is pretty spicy, so if that's a concern I would suggest cutting the crushed red pepper a tiny bit, but I really suggest putting it in there -- it makes a world of difference! I think the next time I will do a quick run through with an emulsion blender to break up a couple of the chunks of tomato, but again, not too much because it really gives it a robust feel. Thank you for the great recipe!

SO easy and SO good!  I did not follow the recipe exactly as far as the canned tomatoes are concerned.  Did not make a difference...

This recipe is delicious and super easy.  I used canned  diced fire roasted tomatoes instead of tomato puree because i like some tomato chunks instead of completely smooth.  I also added some garlic and some chicken stock to taste.  I used baguettes instead of rye with the Brie and I also made some with parmesan.  I floated the crostini on top of the soup instead of pouring soup over it because I like a little crunch left in the bread as you eat it.  Once I had everything assembled I blended part of the soup to smooth it out and I found the second time I made it that if you blend the cream cheese you won't end up with little bits of cream cheese floating in the soup.   If you love tomato soup you will love this.  I made it three days in a row!

Pure comfort food!! My family and I loved this! I doubled all the proportions and used fat-free cream cheese, but kept everything else the same.

I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe. I was craving tomato bisque, even in the sweltering August heat, and this hit the spot. We love spicy but next time I will decrease the pepper flakes to 1/4 tsp. Love the creaminess that the cream cheese lent.  The brie toast made for a very filling meal but I'm going to forego it with the leftovers. Thanks so much for sharing!

I would disagree with the word "spicy" in the title-- even my spice-phobic four year old liked it and I was generous with the pepper-- but the recipe was fast, easy, and delicious.

For everyone who is have trouble getting the cream cheese to blend into the soup...  cut it into chunks and let it come to room temperature.  It will soften the cheese and allows it to melt perfectly.

I used a 14 oz. can of the puree and a 14 oz. can of diced tomatoes w/oregano, garlic & basil. I also skipped the toast part. This recipe was so yummy I am going to make it all the time! Thank you so much for posting it.  :)

Me Like!
Great combination of flavors -- tripled the recipe for a dinner co-op and, like others, opted for a mix of tomato sauce / diced tomatoes (2 and 1 28 oz. cans).
Rye bread was perfect!  Brie cheese lovely!  Almost too spicy (we like spice in our house), so if that's a concern for others perhaps less crushed red pepper... combined with a light sweet salad -- yummy!

I used Italian tomato puree, doubled the milk, and used garlic & herb cream cheese instead of plain.  I felt it needed a bit of salt once it was all mixed together (maybe a 1/4 tsp), but in general liked the consistency and the flavour.  Instead of rye bread, I used a more traditional Italian black olive loaf, which was then used to sop up the soup.  Very good!  An interesting addition to the soup was the inclusion of some balsamic-marinated mushrooms I had made the night before.  It added a lot of texture and flavour, but is not necessary.

Great!!  The only change I made was that I toasted the Brie on homemade whole grain bread (on a super strict diet at the time) but it was fantastic soup that even my husband ate...he doesn't believe that soup is a meal, but now he is a believer.

I loved this soup! I substituted one can of diced tomatoes and one can of tomato puree to improve the texture. It tasted great. Not at all bland. A little to much spice for me but I have a weak tongue. My husband and father-in-law who like spice really enjoyed it. This recipe will definitely be made often at my house.

We have finally found the soup our taste buds were craving!  Our personal favorites- for now!!  I couldn't find puree so I used a can of 29 oz. tomato sauce.  Actually, I have 6 in my family so I doubled it.  This is what I did- 2 can of the tomato sauce and a can (14 oz.) of italitan stewed diced tomatoes.  That may have been a mistake!  The soup was really good,  but the stewed tomatoes had citric acid and made the soup a bit tart.  My husband asked me to leave it next time, although it didn't ruin it.  I noticed other people put intheir reviews that this is what they did, so I thought I would try it.  Anyhow...  We loved it.  The cream cheese took a LONG time to melt, but I cooked it on med. heat and kept stirring it because I really wanted it to simmer down and thicken up.  It ended up cooking about 30 minutes, but that was okay.  I was making grilled cheese and ham sandwiches to eat w/ it and the timing was almost perfect.  My 4 year old even ate it, after I told her it was spaghetti sauce!  She's funny!  I topped it w/ fresh grated parmesaen cheese and that really completed it.  I will definately make this one again!!

Very good! Used heavy cream rather than the milk and white bread as I did not have rye. It was Excellent! For those who had trouble whisking in the cream cheese, just soften in the micro wave a bit and it belnds in beautifully. Thanks for a great recipe!

I'm not a fan of rye bread, but I thought it was pretty good paired with the Brie. The soup, however, wasn't nice at all. I'd try this again but make my own tomato soup from scratch.

Absolutely loved the soup.  Had other food so did not make the grilled toast but will try that soon.  Used 14 oz can of tomato sauce and a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes as well as low fat cream cheese.  Can't wait to make it again!

The tomato bisque made a better pizza sauce the next day than a soup. Too thick. Grilled brie toast was very good though!

I thought this soup was good but could use some adjustments. I also used the 1 can of tomato sauce and 1 can of diced tomatoes instead of the puree. I would of cut in half the amount of cream cheese (and perhaps use a little more milk to compensate) I used because I think it conflicted too much with the tomato and basil flavors of the soup. I think this a great base recipe but needs to be adjusted for personal taste. I didn't make the brie toast since I am not a fan of rye or brie. I ended up making garlic parmesan toast which I think worked great! I will use the recipe again, but I would just lower the amount of cream cheese.

I just made the soup and it was very bland.  It looked very good, but just tasted like tomato sauce, not even soup.  I had to add ALOT to it, and even then it was no where near the taste of a bisque.

We did not like this.  We love rye and tomato bisque, so thought this would be a winner.  We now know we don't like brie!  Also, the soup tasted like a spiced tomatoe puree instead of a good bisque.  I ended up doubling the cream cheese, which made it edible.  I was so excited to try this recipe, so it was very disappointing.

This was DELICIOUS. By far the best tomato soup I've ever had! I did substitute the tomato sauce/diced tomatoes for the puree. Also, I used soft cream cheese (in a tub), which was very easy to whisk into the soup. This soup definitely has a kick to it, so tone down the red pepper if you don't like spicy food. I used ciabatta bread instead of rye, and it turned out really well. Thank you for such a great and extremely easy recipe!!

Who knew this could be so easy?  I'm making a point to keep all the ingredients on hand so I can make a quick fall meal.  A+

Delicious!  Rather than a large can or sauce, I used a 15 oz can of tomato sauce and then a 14.5 oz can of stewed tomatoes, blended together to a puree, and then did the rest of the recipe as written. I served it with homemade grilled cheese rather than the brie toasts. Mmmm!

The soup was really good!  I just didn't enjoy the brie toast so much- I think I would prefer a different cheese.  I didn't have rye, so I used whole-wheat.  I cut the recipe in half for me and my two children.  They really liked the soup (I made their toasts with cheddar and they liked that too).  The soup is tangy and flavorful.  Even though I used a whisk, I still had tiny peices of cream cheese that didn't get incorporated, but it was hardly noticeable.  I omitted the red pepper flakes so I (and the babies)would enjoy it more.  ;)  I used a can of tomato sauce too, instead of puree.  Good simple recipe, and no harder than heating up canned tomato soup!

Sorry I didn't care for this at all. The brie toast was good but the soup was too spicy and the consistancy too thick.

Loved this recipe.  I was not quite sure about this recipe, especially since I'm not a big Brie fan...however, the combination of the soup and the toasted Brie sandwich were superbly complementary to each other.  I did not add any red pepper, added a little bit of sea salt after serving, and pureed whole canned tomatoes for a fresher version than store-bought pureed tomatoes.

An excellent lunch. I'm usually not a big fan of tomato soup, but I love sandwiches with brie, so I thought I'd give it a try. All of the flavors worked well together and I really liked the heat of the soup.

So easy and good! The cream cheese was low fat so I added 1 T butter for extra richness.

I made just the bisque part and it turned out great. I made slight changes: started by sauteeing some onions and garlic then proceeded to add tomatoe sauce and diced tomatoes as others suggested. I halved the red pepper and added more basil as well as a 1/2 tsp garlic powder and salt to taste (I used "no salt added" tomato sauce and diced tomatoes). Then after adding the cream cheese and milk, I pureed the mixture using an emulsion blender. Final product: just the right amount of spiciness for my taste and absolutely delicious!

I've made this bisque many times as written, it's fantastic! The purée gives it an addictive tang that tomato soups don't have. The amount of pepper flakes gives it a perfect kick. Will continue to make again and again. Thanks for the recipe :)

I had to suit it to my own tastes (and what was in my fridge, because I didn't plan ahead. Still tasted great. I'll make it again. Instead of brie I used havarti because my guy isn't a fan of the pungent french cheese.

I added some grated onion, freshly grated Parmesan cheese and a few more tsp of sugar and it was really good.  Beware though, if you do not like a lot of spice, you may want to dial back the red pepper flakes.  I like spicy and this was almost too spicy for me.

This wonderful!  I made my own puree from tomatoes from our garden.  I didn't have brie, but made croutons out of the rye bread and sprinkled on top of the bisque. They added a nice texture and added flavor.  I have some more tomatoes to process- will make more bisque this week.  Will make sure I have Brie this time.

This recipe was OK.  I thought it tasted too much like thick tomato sauce and nothing else.  The cream cheese didn't quite melt all the way so there were tiny little 'chunks' of cream cheese.  It wasn't so bad with the toast and brie.  I guess I was hoping it would be just as good on its own.  But I still encourage you to try it...maybe it wasn't exactly for me.

Really good! I would use the other suggestions about using sauce and canned tomatoes... the consistency using just the puree was a bit thick, almost like a sauce. I even doubled the milk in order to thin it, but it didn't really help. The brie toasts were delicious! I never thought to make a grilled cheese out of brie and rye.

I loved, the spice and thick texture.  Easy to make. I thought it needed salt and the cream cheese gave it a bit of a sour taste.  Next time I make it I am going to cut down on the cream cheese and add some butter. Great recipe. Thanks!
