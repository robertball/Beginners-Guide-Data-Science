A couple of notes to add to my recipe that didn't come through in the published version:
When you are cooking the onions, parsley, and mushrooms, it should be a slow saute - without boiling.

When you add the flour, salt, pepper and lemon juice, just cook for a couple of minutes to take the raw taste out of the flour (not until the flour is slightly browned).

Lastly, for a larger group, just double all ingredients and use a 13x9 pan. It may take a little longer to heat through, but no other changes needed in the directions.

Great for leftovers the next day - if you have any!

I gave this recipe 4 stars because it was yummy, but called for WAY too much butter! The cracker crust was soggy and the butter pooled on the top of the dish. I actually used paper towels to sop up some of the pooled butter. So, delicious recipe, but if I make it again I will use very little butter in the topping, as the crackers are already buttery, and will brown without anything.

This was a great change from the standard green bean casseroles I have had in the past. I added about 2 cups of mushrooms and a bit more lemon juice. Next time I am going to try fresh green beans and leave out the cheese. Yummy!

This was BANG on for our family.  I am not the biggest fan of "normal" Green Bean Casseroles w/ the Cream of Mushroom soup & fried onions on top, so I've been wanting to find something different.  And this is it!  I did everything as is, except for I threw in some left-over ham & didn't do so much butter for the topping. (due to previous reviews)  I did a couple Tblspoons of marg & crushed cornflakes.  DELISH!!!  A note though...  The ham took it over the top!!!  BUT if you use the ham you may want to tone down the salt.  We liked it, but I'm sure a lot of people would have thought it was a bit salty.  THANKS for this recipe!!  This is one I will be making OFTEN!  :)

Ohmigosh - The mushroom flavor was way to strong and the sauce not creamy at all.

I scaled this down to three servings, using one can of regular green beans. I subbed plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream, using a little less, but adding some creamer to get the consistency right. I did cut back on the mushrooms, used lime juice (was only small amount), and garlic powder, which this dish definitely needs. I didn't miss using the cream of mushroom soup / dried onions. This is really delicious, and I know I'll make it again!

I make it EXACTLY as the recipe states with the exception that I use about 1 lb of fresh green beans. I clip off the ends, steam them until vivid green and then toss them in. My husband HATES GB Casserole, and loved this with the fresh beans.

I just made this recipe as a side dish for dinner, I did makesome substitutions for ingredience I did not have on hand. It was awesome and as I cut the recipe in half for two. I used fresh cooked green beans chilled in the fridge,about half a pound, 1/2 cup Plain Greek Yogurt, 1/2 cup Panko Bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Kraft Mexican blend Cheese... Will definitely do this again for family if they will let me but try the original recipe.

This is a new staple in our family! I made it for Easter and it was quickly requested for future holiday meals and of course, I'm happy to oblige. My notes on the recipe are this, omitting the butter with the crust is a perfect, it's definitely too much butter with it (particularly for my health-concious sister-in-law). It's also great because for me because I can easily eat around the mushrooms that everyone else in the family enjoys. I don't like the texture of mushrooms and the traditional GBC with cream of mushroom soup is unpleasant because I can still feel the texture of the mushrooms. This recipe is perfect because I can make the  mushrooms large enough for me to avoid and the family LOVES the large mushrooms. My biggest note is, this makes a 9x13 pan  that's pretty full. We had 10 adults eating it at these meals and there is NO need to double the recipe. We always have enough for the meal and leftovers. This recipe is now a family tradition in just one year and it's so easy, I don't mind. Thanks for a great recipe that makes everyone in our family happy!

Instead of 1 cup sour cream, I made it 1\2 cup sour cream and 1\2 cup milk.  Have it a creamier texture.

my neighbor made this for Thanksgiving and I took a polite helping because I don't like green bean casserole.  Oh boy was I surprised!!  This was the best I' be ever tasted and I went back for seconds!!   Really happy when I got some leftovers.  in fact, I asked for the recipe , I'm making this myself.  Try it, you will never go back to the  made with canned soup!

I made this recipe for Christmas dinner and I really  liked it.  I will say, however, that I wish it had been creamier even though I made this specifically because it didn't use cream of mushroom soup.  I think that I will omit the flour and add perhaps a cup of vegetable broth (or less) to the sour cream to add some creamy-ness.  I don't think the flour added anything useful for me (I omitted the mushrooms, so perhaps the lack of liquid from them makes a difference with the flour).  Used fresh, steamed beans and felt that this was very healthy.  Thankyou for sharing!

Thank you so much for this recipe!  I decided to to green bean casserole for Thanksgiving, but I do not like cream of mushroom.  I did a 1/2 recipe today, just to test it out before TG.  Delicious!!
