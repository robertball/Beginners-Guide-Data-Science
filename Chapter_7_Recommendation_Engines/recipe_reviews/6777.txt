I altered this recipe, taking suggestions from all the previous reviewers.  I shorted the sugar 1/2 cup and used half brown sugar and half white sugar for the 2 cups required.  I also added 2 tsp of cinnamon, and used butter instead of shortening.  I put in 4 very ripe bananas, didn't bother to measure them and I used pecans.  I also cooked it just a little longer than recipe calls for.  Family and coworkers RAVED.  Very moist and lots of banana flavor.

This recipe made the most delicious and moist banana nut bread.  It was so easy to do, just mix and stick in the oven.  My boyfriend and I made 4 loaves in a month. :)  I like to add 2 tsps. of cinnamon and 1.5 tsps of nutmeg for a little extra spice.  I stir in 3/4 of the walnuts and leave the rest to sprinkle on top with sugar.  It makes for a nice crust.  And if you're short on bananas, add some apple sauce (but not too much as it can make the bread TOO moist).

We did notice that it took a little longer to cook than specified, about another 30 minutes.  It's best just to check the center of the bread after an hour in the oven.

Delicious!!! I was looking for a quick, easy nutritious bread... this was it! I just made my own buttermilk(2 tsp lemon juice per 1/2 cup milk and added more nuts. A big hit and simply disappeared!

This came out really well!  I doubled the recipe and made 2 pans of mini loaves and 2 large loaves (9x5) - I added chocolate chips to the larger loaves - delicious!  I read the reviews and lessened the amount of sugar, but did both of brown and white sugar.  To make things easier, I mixed all the wet ingredients in my electric mixer and all the dry ingredients in a large bowl, and then combined them slowly.  My bananas were not completely ready but I tossed them in my food processor and gave it a quick spin to make it easier.  Finally, I topped the mini loaves with walnuts which added a nice crunch!

The texure of this bread was medium to light.  It was very moist.  I liked everything about it except that I thought it was too sweet.  I made mini loafs with half the batter.  I like banana nut bread to taste more like bananas and nuts with bread.  This was more like sugar with bananas nuts and bread. I think I am trying to convince myself that I like it but I don't think I really do.

Hey all!  You might want to give this recipe a try.  Especially novice bakers, I think this recipe will help boost the culinary moral of those just starting off.  Good recipe all the way around, although, I did make a couple of adjustments.  I opted for 2 cups of sugar instead of 2 1/2, I used 1/2 c. unsalted butter, 
1/2 c.shortening and because I didn't have any buttermilk handy, I used 1 1/4 cups of whole milk with one tsp of apple cider vinegar added.  Remember that if you are using dark coated pans to reduce your oven temp by 25 degrees.  I found that my bread was perfect right at the 55 minute mark. I made this bread for my 6 year old granddaughter who is a banana junkie...she now thinks I'm a godess!

Great recipe. I did five bananas, but I like a more banana taste than bread. I also used two cups of sugar, one brown and one white. I added a half tsp of cinnimon and nutmeg. This recipe was very very moist. At first when I took it out of the oven, it looked like it might be dry. After eating a few bites, I realized it was the "look" of the bread, but the dry looking top was very crunchy, in a very good way. It was delicious, and two loaves lasted one day! :) Will be my new recipe, thanks!!

This bread is super moist!! It was a little too sweet for me at first but the ingredients and easily adjustable and I got it just how I like it the second time around. I love it and my co-workers loved it more! They keep asking me when I'll bring more. And I've already brought it three times!!
  I like that this recipe fits perfectly into one of my bunt molds. It's good to feed a fairly large amount of people if you make two bunts (and they're hungry men, haha).

This was great!  I didn't have regular flour or buttermilk, so I made some substitutions (healthy ones) and it turned out really moist and good. 

--- Only used 1 cup of sugar.
---  4 medium bananas
---  Organic Whole Wheat flour (you cannot taste the difference in this bread!)
---  1 cup no fat Greek Yogurt (in place of buttermilk)
---  1/4 cup 2% milk

This bread still turned out pretty sweet and lots of banana flavor.   I only cooked it for 45 minutes at 350 because I like it moist.

Loved this recipe!  The banana bread came out nice and moist.  I followed other reviewers suggestions and used 1 cup of brown sugar and 1 1/2 cups of white sugar.  It seemed to have the exact amount of sweetness that our family liked.  I also used 1 cup of unsalted butter for the shortening.  The recipe yielded 2 loaves and I thought I would have to freeze one of them, but 1 loaf was gone within 2 hours of coming out of the oven!  This will now be our "go to" recipe from now on.

Best banana bread I have ever had.  I was so impressed with myself after I made this.  Everything was perfect.  And I wrapped the loaves in foil to keep them moist, and it worked.  Three days after I baked them they are still delicious and moist.  Thank you!!!!

Man! Just took my loaves out of the oven & sliced off a piece-- this is some fantastic banana bread! I subbed butter for the shortening, reduced the buttermilk to just 1 cup & reduced the sugar to 2 cups. I will be making this one again, for sure!

THE BEST BANANA BREAD EVER...EXACTLY as the recipe stands.  I've received rave reviews on this bread and I don't even like to cook.  No need to change a thing.  Every time I make banana bread, I figure why mess with perfection.  It's gotta be the buttermilk and I love that it makes two loaves.  MOST EXCELLENT bread!  Thank you, Gwynne.

This is amazing!  I used 4 bananas, real butter, added cinnamon, and used splenda blend sugar and brown sugar so my diabetic mother and mother in law could have some.  It is soooo moist and it was plenty sweet with the splenda!  I will not use any other banana nut bread recipe from now on, this is it for me :)

Best recipe I've tried! I make banana nut muffins every Sunday with over ripe bananas that didn't get eaten. This is by far the best. I did half the recipe and add 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1 tsp cinnamon because I like them to have some spice. I also made muffins instead of bread. Other than that, these are perfect! Thanks for the recipe!

I just got into cooking, and the first thing I made was some oatmeal chocolate chip cookies. I thought those were as good as it gets, but this recipe proved me wrong! It's moist for far longer then any other bread, and you can really taste the bananas. It turned out just perfect! I baked it all myself and I'm only 12 years old. I left out the bread cut into slices all day and I found it gone before I even had a second serving!

This is by far the best tasting Banana Nut Bread I have ever had! However, every time I make this it bubbles over and makes a giant mess in my oven. I cannot figure for the life of me what is wrong. Can anybody give me some suggestions?

Best Banana Nut Bread recipe I've ever made.  Very moist, great banana flavor.  This will definitely be the one I make again next time.  I found this by looking at ingredients - needed to use some overripe bananas and had eggs, walnuts, and buttermilk. The only deviation from the recipe is that I used 4 bananas and a whole cup of walnuts.  This just couldn't be any better!

This makes excellent banana bread if you use just 2 cups of sugar; half brown, half white. I also subbed butter for the shortening and added in a couple teaspoons of cinnamon as previous reviewers suggested. Definitely my new go to recipe for banana bread.

This was DELICIOUS, but as always I had to jack with the recipe just a bit.  I substituted 1/2 the sugar with Light brown sugar, 1 T cinnamon and I added 1 T grated orange peel.  I also accidentally dumped in 3x as much vanilla as was called for.  Turned out to be a boon!!  PS:  Biscuit mix is NOT a good substitute for flour if you are out of baking powder.  It rises 2X what is expected and spills all over the oven.  It is good to have a sense of humor in situations like this lol!

I love Banana Nut Bread. I had to make my own changes. I used 6 T. Butter, 1 C. Sugar, 3 very ripe bananas, 3 eggs, 1/2 C. Buttermilk, 2 C. Flour, 1 tsp. baking soda, 1 tsp. baking powder, 1 tsp. Nutmeg, 1/2 tsp. Salt, 3/4 C Chopped Pecans. I put it in a 9X5 loaf pan baked at 350 F for 60 minutes. It turned out perfect!

The best banana nut bread ever. Even those who aren't big banana fans gobble this up then ask for the recipe. However, I have changed the recipe a bit to suit my tastes as I wasn't crazy about the results when I followed the recipe exactly the first time. Instead of shortening, I used 1/2c. butter and 1/2c. olive oil. I also increased the banana to 2 cups and I think that it's important to use extremely ripe bananas for maximum flavor. I added another egg, because I tend to only have small/medium eggs in the house. I think 3 large/extra large eggs would work fine though. I also doubled the nuts, because that's the way I like it.

I took the advise of others and used 1 cup of each white and brown sugar.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon of salt because every recipe I've ever used that had  baking powder and soda also had some salt as well.  This turned out very very good compared to other banana bread recipes I have made.  I think the buttermilk is the main reason.  This is a keeper for sure.

This is the best banana bread recipe!  The bread is very moist and just the right fluffiness.  The crust comes out slightly crispy and perfectly brown.  I made a couple of slight changes (based on what I had on hand).  I used butter instead of shortening, and I only had 1 1/2 cups of sugar left, so I subbed 1 cup of granulated Splenda.

I followed the recipe with the previous suggestions and used convection at 325 degrees. PERFECT!
I had to take it all to work to keep from overdosing!
Many rave reviews came in.

I made this with only two cups of white sugar (so dropped a half cup). I made one with and one without nuts. I found they were both a little too moist so will be using less bananas next time. Overall a very good recipe that I will use again.

This recipe is amazing. I used non-fat milk instead of buttermilk so not to make it too sweet. I also added an extra 2 bananas because I like it to taste like bananas with bread not bread with a hint of banana. I also sprinkle the walnuts with sugar and cinnamon and bake them at  325 F for 10-15 minutes before chopping them and mixing them in. I used butter instead of shortening as I think it's a more natural alternative. But, I'll have to try the 1/2 brown 1/2 white sugar next time. My family loved it--definitely a recipe to save!

I tried this recipe for the first time and I like it. I cut down the sugar to 2 cups which was a mistake. It needed to be a little bit sweeter. Next time, I'll go by the recipe. Especially with not so ripe bananas.

I made this in mini loaves for a Church bake sale last year(It made 8 mini loaves so I did 2 batches). They were gone in less than thirty minutes! Everyone raved about them a begged for the recipe.It's really moist and the buttermilk makes all the difference.  
Its now time for the bake sale again a people are still talking about my delicious banana nut bread and they asked me to bring it again.  I'm so glad I saved this one in my recipe box.  Its definately a keeper!

Not bad - very. very sweet though - I would reduce the sugar next time maybe even by a whole cup, and I think it needs a pinch of salt.  I used butter instead of shortening.  I think next time I will add a bit more banana.  I actually did measure out 1 1/2 cups, but I generally add more banana than what is called for in recipes, so I think I'm used to more banana flavor.

This Banana Bread is YUMMY!  I used margarine instead of shortening (not that I think it makes a difference) and I mashed up 4 bananas which might have been more like 2 cups instead of 1.5.  The result is absolute perfection!

Wonderful! My family and friends loved it. I followed some of the other viewers tips about the butter instead of shortening and 2 cups of bananas and I added cinamon. This is a keeper. It was so moist. I also topped it with powdered sugar. Yum!

I made this on a Saturday night for Monday morning's breakfast.  I ate one slice immediately and thought it was too bland, three star material.  Monday morning rolled around, though and I liked it better.  It seemed to have more flavor so I bumped it up to four stars. 

Here are the alterations I've tried and liked: I only have 8x4 pans and it never rises very high so I'm not sure the 9x5 pan called for in the original recipe is accurate. My whole family liked it better without nuts, though no one complained about the one with nuts. We thought there was also too much sugar and cut it down to two cups. Also, we liked it better with half brown sugar, half white because the brown has a more complex flavor. I tried it with half whole wheat flour, too, and couldn't detect a flavor or texture difference, but there is the obvious health benefit.

I love to use recipes from this website, and most of them are wonderful. I sure hope this bread tastes better than it looks. I followed the recipe, but the loaves sank in the middle and look terrible. I hope they come out of the pans and taste good enough to take them to church tomorrow.

I hate to go against all of the positive reviews but, unfortunately, I didn't enjoy this recipe. I went according to the recipe except for a few adjustments suggested by others. I used butter instead of shortening and I added 1 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and cinnamon each. I used white sugar for the full amount instead of part brown, part white. I also used four very ripe bananas. Unlike a lot of people I thought it needed more sugar. It tasted bland and doughy. As soon as it hit my mouth it turned into a huge ball of dough. My husband, who also loves banana bread, thought it was doughy as well. I had to cook it longer than the recommended time which ended up being an hour and 25 mins; it wasn't done at the  recommended time. I thought about making it again with a few alterations but I don't think I will. My husband's co-worker's banana nut bread tasted a lot better. I'll be using her recipe next time.

I whipped this up just to save some bananas from a bitter demise. It was quick, easy and I left out nuts just because I didn't have any. I also normally use a 2:1 butter:veggie oil substitute for many recipes that call for shortening. I did that here.  It was FANTASTIC and filled our home with a fragrant, warm and loving smell. Thanks for sharing!

This really is a great recipe! I added some  cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg, cause I like them. I also added some chocolate chips and dried cranberries. It made 2 big, delicious loaves!

It turned out good.  I just think it could have been better.  I will probably use it again.

I made this banana nut bread today and even though I followed the instructions, it didn't quite turn out right. First of all, I had to bake it about fifteen minutes longer because the toothpick wouldn't come out clean and even with the additional time, it's still too moist.  Also, it was too sweet for my taste.

I used 1 c. of white and 1 c. of brown sugar. I added 1 tsp. of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg. I substituted butter for the shortening and I increased the flour to 3 1/2 cups. I also added about 1/2 cup of wheat germ. I cooked it for 1 hour 5 minutes. The batter easily fit in two of my silver pans which are smaller than the recommended 9x5's.

This banana nut bread was the best ever.  However I change somethings in this recipe just a bit. Like this recipe ask for 1 cup of shortening I change it to 1/2 cup of organic extra virgin coconut oil and 1/2 cup of butter and now that's some good stuff.

I used 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar.  Replaced real butter for the shortening.  Added some all spice, nutmeg, cinnamon, nuts and white chocolate chips.  Sprinkled brown sugar on top with a dash of cinnamon and more nuts.  I didn't have two loaf pans so I used up the extra batter and made muffins.  We liked the muffins better than the loaf.  Either way, I will make these again just to change up from my usual recipe that calls for sour cream.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I had some buttermilk to use up before it expired and a bunch of overripe bananas, so I decided to try this recipe.  I'm glad I did, it turned out great!  I made a few changes:  I used unsalted butter instead of shortening and added 2 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. salt.  I kept the sugar the same and I don't think it is too sweet at all!  I had 3 small bananas and 2 medium bananas, which was just about 1 1/2 cups.  My only complaint about this recipe is that the bread didn't rise.  I don't know if I did something wrong or if it's just the recipe.  Despite that, the bread was moist, fluffy and tender.  My hubby took one loaf into work and it got rave reviews!

I was looking for a banana nut bread like Bob Evans and this is it!  I used 1 cup of brown and 1 cup of white sugar, Parkay, 4 bananas, added 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon, and sprinkled cinnamon on top.  I baked it for 45 minutes.  Moist, dense, and delicious!

I made this recipe today & we are already into the second loaf, so I know it's a hit! I only changed a couple things, I used 1/2 brown & 1/2 white sugar instead of all white, and I also added some cinnamon. Also I just added four really ripe bananas instead of measuring. I used the convection setting on my oven & cooked for 50 mins at 325. Moist & fluffy.Perfection! I will definately make this one again.

For some reason, the bananas I've been buying lately have been ripening quicker than my family can eat them. This is the third recipe I've made in two days. Only change I made was adding a 1/2 tsp. of butter flavoring. The batter was incredibly fluffy when I poured it into the pans. This made two big loaves. I plan on giving it to my mother in law, so I'll update when she's had a chance to enjoy it.

I thought this recipe was great.  I reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup and used 1 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of white sugar as someone suggested. I will definitely make these again.

This is the greatest banana bread recipe ever!  I love that it makes two loaves- we eat one right away and the other I put in the freezer for another time.  It tastes just as wonderful after being frozen and defrosted.

This is so good.  I followed the advice of some other reviewers (instead of shortening, I added margarine) and the bread turned out awesome. All my family and friends loved it and ask for more.  Simply the best.

I got this recipe a few years ago and did some subsitiutions for the butter milk. I use plain yogurt.  I don't keep butter milk around like that, but I do have yogurt.  Over the years I have a great recipe and always look back at this one as how I got started.  I did make it according to the recipe, with butter milk, but like mine better. The rating is based on the execution of the recipe as written.

This recipe is awesome with just enough banana flavour!  I did add about 1/2tsp of cinnamon and it turned out perfectly.  I baked the bread in one Pampered Chef bread loaf stone (which is quite large), it cooked over the edges a bit and I had to leave it in for an extra 35 mins but no burning and it stayed nice and moist.  Great recipe, I'm replacing my old one and I've saved this one to my favourites.

I've been baking for over 40 years and I can honestly say this is the BEST banana nut bread recipe I've ever found.  It even beats the one from my mother in law which I've used for years. I probably baked 2 dozen batches last year for Christmas and they kept coming back for more.  By far the most moist loaves I've ever had!!

Do lessen the amount of sugar (I used 1 1/2 cup of white & 1/2 cup of brown).  The flavor is lovely, especially with a little extra banana.  Be very careful...the buttermilk makes this bread super fragile.  Grease the heck out of the pan and let the bread cool before removing.  My bread fell apart when I removed it...but the flavor was wonderful.

Great recipe. I made a few alterations to it after reading the reviews.  I used 1 1/2 C. white sugar, and 3/4 C. brown sugar. I also used butter instead of shortening.  I added an extra 1/2 C. Banana, and added cinnamon, nutmeg, and a tiny bit of clove.  Its super moist, and full of flavor. Just how we like our banana bread!

I made it and it came out delicious. Very soft and moist. My family loved it. I didn't have have buttermilk, so I used 1 1/4 cup of milk with 1 tsp of Apple vinegar. I also used 1 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of white sugar instead of the 2 1/2 cups. And I also added 1/2 tsp of salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg. I didn't have another loaf pan so I used a muffin pan. The muffins baked for 25 min and the bread 1 hr and 15 min. Time was more than it had stated in the recipe. But it was really good

This is the best banana nut recipe ever! I made seven loaves yesterday and gave most of them away so now today I have to make more. I used half brown sugar/half white. And used butter instead of shortening. Other than that I followed recipe to the letter.

Modified scones -  double the flour. I wanted to make a half-serving, but forgot to half the flour. The dough ends up looking like cookie dough, so I drop cookie-sized dough on a cookie sheet, baked @350F for 9-10 mins. The result: yummy scones!  Note:  - Be careful - tops won't brown and will look pale. - I followed JANICER8's sugar combo,  suggested cinnamon addition, and butter in place of shortening

Very moist and delicious! I had run out of milk, so I substituted heavy cream and butter - very rich indeed!

This bread turned out delicious! I guess the buttermilk really made it extra moist.I'll have to keep buttermilk on hand just for this recipe.I did add about a half teaspoon of cinnamon to mine and instead of shortening I used 1/2 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of applesauce.I sprinkled a little brown sugar on the tops before baking.I like to bake all my breads in mini loaf pans and this recipe made five.I gave my mom and uncle each a loaf and they want more!I'm going to experiment and add some strawberries or blueberries next time.I do believe this is my new favorite banana bread recipe.

I have been making this banana bread for a couple years now & every time I make it, it's gone in a flash.  I didn't change a thing.  Moist & delicious every time.  Many have asked for copies.

A very moist and delicious banana bread!  Like others I used 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar.  This recipe makes generous loaves - I separated the dough in half and used walnuts for one loaf and chocolate chips for the other. So good!  Next time I will try adding additional bananas and cutting back on the buttermilk to compensate.

We prepared the Banana Nut Bread according to the recipe with the following exceptions:Used Butter not shortening; Used Pecans not Walnuts.  The buttermilk made it very moist.  This is the tastiest Banana Nut Bread I have eaten.  Next time We will add Cinnamon and nutmeg to see how that tastes in this recipe.  Those 2 spices we have always used, but NEVER have we had a Banana Nut Bread as moist as this.  We love it!!!

This bread is okay it really depends on what you are looking for in it. I was hoping for something like Bob Evans banana nut bread and I got more like a little debbie snack cake. I consider myself someone who likes a good bit of sugar but this recipe calls for entirely to much it tasted like I was eating sweet bread with a hint of banana. Thankfully I was making muffins out of this and added extra after the first batch. Overall it's not a horrible recipe I doubt I will make it again but if I do I will definately cut the sugar way down.  Another problem that someone else mentioned was that the bread was flat I noticed this too with my first batch but the second which I added more banana too and had set out for awhile baked up perfectly.

As written, I'm going to give it 4 stars.  I know this may sound silly, but it's actually too moist, verging on mushy.  I'm re-making it today using butter in place of shortening and hoping for a better taste.

Excellent! Add 1 T cinnamon. If short on buttermilk use milk & lemon juice. My kids made this and it was delicious - not too sweet with 2 1/2 C. sugar.  It didn't rise much, so fill pan completely full. Prepare pan with butter and dust with flour.

So delicious!  Kids and hubby gobbled it up.  Like others, I also used butter (smart balance light) instead of shortening.  Didn't have two loaf pans so I made one loaf and 24 muffins.  The family will be glad it made so much!

Wow! We just made this directly by the recipe, except for adding extr walnuts, and it is excellent.  We also made some in 8X4 inch loaf pans and they were perfect in 50 minutes.  the larger pan took about 65 minutes.

EXCELLENT!  VERY MOIST.  I tried using half butter and half shortening. I also didn't have buttermilk on hand so I had 
"buttermilK Blend" for baking on hand(i't a powdered substance to mix with water to make buttermilk) and it worked. Very moist bread.

This is truly the best banana bread I've ever tasted. I did listen to the previous reviewer and I added 2 tsp. of cinnamon and 2 tsp. of nutmeg and only put 2 cups of sugar. I also substitued half of the flour for whole wheat. I did not have shortening and substituted with butter. Next time I'll try substituting with a little applesauce to make it a little healthier.

I'm a southern girl and we love cooking, sitting around the kitchen table hanging out and eating. I had a favorite recipe for banana bread, but it was lost. I needed one in a hurry and no one could help me fast enough. So, I headed for the internet and this recipe seemed close to our family recipe. I loved it!!! A little sweet- however I like sweet. As a few reviewers stated- next time I will use less sugar and more bananas. Oh- I also used butter not shortening.

Excellent!! I doubled this recipe since I had abt 4cups of ripe bananas avail. I followed the suggestions of going half & half w/ white & brown sugar as well as shortening & butter. Also added 4t cinnamon & 1t nutmeg. Didn't add nuts as we don't like them. These turned out perfect!! Wonderful w/ butter. Nice & moist! May add cinnamon & sugar to tops next time.

This recipe is absolutely delicious!  I have made this several times now, and each time, it gets gobbled up!!!  Its soooo moist and flavorful. I let my bananas ripe until they are pretty brown, and it makes the bread taste SOO much better!  I also cut down on the sugar to just 2 cups.  I haven't tried adding brown sugar though, it sounds like a good idea.  All in all, this recipe is a keeper!  I've tried other banana bread recipes on here, and they were just way too dry!

I did not care for this bread. Although it bakes up a beautiful looking loaf, the texture is weird & I just didn't care for the flavor. I won't be making this again.

I have tried many Banana Nut Bread recipes; and I would like to take my hat off to the chef.  
This bread could not be any moist and delicious than it is!
I don’t have to look any further for a high rating banana bread beacuse this rates 10 out of 5; it will be my recipe.

Thank you for sharing

Very delicious banana bread recipe. I've tried a few and this is one of if not my most favorite. VERY moist and banana-y. Great flavor and texture. Like the better bakery banana breads. I reduced butter (like I often do in similar type recipes often there is more butter called for then needed and I don't like recipes like this greasy) and it still came out fabulous. Yum. :)

I made this bread and it was soooo good.  I used a mini cupcake pan as well because there was a lot of batter left over after I filled up my loaf pan.  I also added little extras like cinnamon , nutmeg and a little bit of clove.  First time I've made bread and it was soooo simple.

I was grossly disappointed with this recipe.  I found it to be very dry rather than moist as indicated.  I will use butter rather than shortening and increase the amount by 1/2 cup IF I try it again.  I like buttermilk recipes so thought I had a "find" here much to my surprise!  This is the first recipe from this site that I was not very happy with, unfortunately.  I would also try 1c brown sugar/1c granulated sugar IF I repeat this recipe.  Still in search of the ultimate recipe.

This recipe gets a 5. The bread was nice and moist. Remember beginners to use real ripe bananas for the most flavor. I did reduce the amount of sugar to 2 cups and it was plenty sweet. I also used 1/2 shortening 1/2 margarine, I was afraid it would taste like shortening. I make breads once a week and I'm always looking for a good recipe this one is a keeper. This is a big recipe I made 3 mini loaves and I bet I could have made 4. Love it I'll just freeze the others.

This banana bread was excellent. I took a loaf to a family get together and everyone ate it up. It didn't rise up in the center like nut breads I have made in the past. It rose but stayed flat like a box... but that didn't matter because it tasted so good. I got MANY compliments. Very very moist. Definitely will make again.

I lowered oven temp a bit and cooked for an additional 15 min. Found bread to be too sweet for my taste but both loaves disappeared. Someone in my house enjoyed it.

I liked it the first time, but this time it didn't come out quite right.  it has a nice flavor, but it's too moist in the middle and it shrinks when you take it out of the oven, so sadly.  Definitely use at least 1 cup nuts.

Yummy!  Wonderfully moist and easy.  Add extra bananas for more intense flavor.  I found that a half cup of walnuts was a little stingy, so I added more.  When the recipe calls for a greased pan, be sure to grease it well or else the bread will stick - mine did.  It did not come out very pretty, but tasted wonderful.  After cutting it, no one knew that it stuck a little.

My husband and co-workers all grumbled about messing with a good thing when I told them I was trying a new banana nut bread recipe.  After eating it though, everyone was in complete agreement with me.  The old recipe went in the trash!  This bread is absolutely divine!  It did take about 15 to 20 minutes longer to cook than the recipe stated it would though.

i have made this bread a number of times.  when i get to share it with others they say that it is the best that they have ever eaten.  i ahve found that i have to cook the bread at leat 10 more minutes than the directions say.  i just keep testing until it is done.  i think that it is an award winning recipe.

Has anyone made muffins using this recipe? What would be the cooking time? I'm think like 1/2, but not sure.
I've made this many times and have never been disappointed. It always turns out great! Didn't read it closely the first time though and didn't notice that it made 2....lol, that was fun!

Very moist and very yummy. I did, however, add a full tablespoon of cinnamon, 3/4 teaspoon of cloves and a teaspoon of salt because I know it would've been a little bland for our tastes without seasonings.

I give this recipe 5 stars although I did alter it a little according to another reviewers suggestions. Instead of shortening I used butter and I used 4 bananas without measuring them. Prep time was short and super easy. The bread came out super moist. Will be making it again soon.

I adjusted the recipe to use 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar.  BUTTER is better than shortening.  It was plenty sweet.  The bread was excellent.

Amazing recipe! I have never made banana bread before and my husband was impressed that I could bake these and them taste amazing! I increased the bananas to 2 1/2 cups and the loafs turned out so moist and amazing!

Moist and delicious! I cut back on the sugar as others had suggested because I really don't like anything too sweet. I used 1c white sugar, 1c brown sugar, and butter instead of shortening. I will definitely be making this again!

LOVED it! I used 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugar, replaced the shortening with butter, used skim milk, 3 bananas and a tsp of cinnamon.

Just used this recipe for the first time last week, with a few adjustments, but it was delicious! I used a little extra banana, and cut back on some sugar while also using brown sugar; went half and half with shortening and butter. I also added cinnamon and nutmeg! Overall, great outcome! Very moist. Dont overgrease your pans otherwise it will be very wet and sticky on the outside.

I let it cool down and then my husband and I dove right in!! It's my first time making bread and it was so easy and it came out delicious!  I did what everybody else did and cut the sugar buy 1/2 and did white and brown, added cinnamon, and didn't measure the bananas.  I used 4 and it made 3 small loaf pans worth. It's a keeper!

I tried this and EVERYONE who tasted it LOVED it, I am on my twelve loaf for the holidays because now everyone wants one. I do agree cooking time is about 5-10 minutes more and now I want to try some of the adjustments others made, also I got better reviews with the pecans vs walnuts. Still my most favorite ever!!!

I used butter instead of shortening and half brown sugar instead of white sugar.  Also, I made these in two large muffin pans.  They came out terrific!

Very good!  Like others, I added 1/2 cup less sugar, butter instead of oil, some cinnamon and nutmeg, chopped pecans. I didn't find this to be too much sugar since I don't like things too sweet. So good warmed and buttered the next day.

I used JANICER8's suggestions but used a small (6oz) bag of semi-sweet chocolate instead of nuts, perfect amount.  Next time I will use a 12oz bag, because I am really chocolate crazy.  JANICER8's comments were to use instead of 2.5 cups of sugar, use 1 cup of brown and 1 cup of white sugar and use butter instead of shortening.  Use 4 very ripe bananas.

This bread was made for Saturday morning and coffee.  So good, we didn't even have to butter it.  Recipe halves well, using 1/2 cup ea. brown & white sugar & 1 jumbo egg.  Used pecans and butter.  Bread was moist & flavor was intense.  Thank you for this keeper!

This is very moist with a nice banana flavor. I cut the recipe in half to make one loaf and reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup -- using 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 dark brown sugar and 1/4 cup light brown sugar (if you don't add cinnamon and nutmeg, then you need the brown sugar for flavor). For an egg substitute, I used 1/4 cup unsweetened apple sauce mixed with 1/2 teaspoon of backing powder. I also used whole wheat flour.
Don't be fooled into thinking this is healthy, though, just because of the banana. This is more of a dessert or snack than a suitable breakfast meal.

This bread was incredibly moist.  I followed the recipe to a T, except that I used homemade buttermilk and butter for shortening because I didnt have any.  I baked it for 50 minutes and any longer would've burnt the outside... but it was cooked to perfection.  Next time I make this, I will add cinnamon and maybe a little nutmeg because I thought it was lacking in flavor a little.  Overall, however, it was a great recipe that I plan to use again.

This was so good. I used this recipe instead of one that I normally use, and this one is better I think. It gets pretty brown on top, I kept checking it to make sure it wasn't burnt, but it turned out great. And the dark part gets a little crunchy and then it is my favorite part of the bread.

This recipe is great.  It is really sweet, like cake.  I added more bananas and 1/2 cup more walnuts.  Be sure to cut the slices thick, it does tend to 'break' easily, but not complaining about that!

This banana bread is so awesome!! Very soft and delicious . . . everyone loved it!! I would make sure to use over-ripe bananas to make sure it's sweet. If you don't have those on hand, use half white sugar and half brown.

Wonderful!  I tweaked it a little.  I added about 1/2 cup more banana, about 1/8 cup milled flax seed (for nutrition) and I also did half brown sugar, half white, I only used about 3/4 cup buttermilk, and I also added about 1&1/2 tsp. cinnamon, and a pinch of nutmeg.  Great recipe.  Putting it in my recipe box.

This was my very first batch of Banana Nut Bread and this recipe was so easy you wouldn't think that it's going to be as good as it is when it's done. This one goes in the recipe box.

First time I ever made banana nut bread and it got rave reviews from the folks at work.  I used 1 cup or sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar instead of the 2 1/2 cups and I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 crisco.  Will definitely make this again. Very easy recipe.

This is a fantastic recipe.  I've tried and failed several times trying new banana nut bread recipes & this was by far the easiest!  Following the advice of several other users, I did modify this recipe slightly.  I reduced the sugar to only 2 cups using 1 cup white & 1 cup brown sugar.  I also used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup of Crisco.  As my kids claim it's "easier" to eat muffins that bread (and easier for me since there are fewer crumbs on my kitchen floor) I went with the muffin idea.  I baked them at 350 for about 22 minutes.  This made about 30 muffins and they were gone in a hurry!

I made this for me and my boyfriend and we both liked it a lot!  I also used some cinnamon and nutmeg, toasted the walnuts, and also only used 2 cups of sugar.  The more ripe your bananas, the less sugar you need because they get sweeter as they ripen and turn spotty.  I will definitely make this banana nut bread again!

I used only 2 c. of sugar instead of 2.5, and it was plenty. You could use even less. Also, I think this bread is a tad greasy as is. You can add another banana, and it turns out fine.

This recipe is definitely one worth saving. No matter how much I make it is gone in a matter of minutes and people keep asking for more. I lost the recipe once and thank goodness I found it again, because the is none the same!

Very good bread. I made this exactly according to the recipe and it came out a little sweet.  I think the other reviewers were right about using 2 cups of sugar instead of 2 and 1/2.  I sifted the flour and the texture was just right.  I'm going to use two cups of bananas next time. A little light on the banana flavor.

I used one XL loaf pan (9 3/4 by 5 3/4) and sized this recipe down to 14 servings (using the helper at the bottom of the recipe).  This bread was for my husband who likes banana bread with no nuts.  I think that nuts would have made this recipe ten times better, but that's my fault for marrying a guy who hates nuts...anyway I was not too impressed but this was a decent bread. I like my banana bread a little more dense and buttery this one was neither. I had no problem baking because I dropped our oven temp 50 degrees since I was using a darker nonstick pan. This loaf came out perfect at 60 minutes.  My quest for banana bread continues, but my picky husband thinks this one is really good so I may make it again. Thanks for the recipe!

My whole family loved it! I thought it was a bit too sweet and bland tasting but I'm thinking that's just in the very beginning because when I ate it again after being in the fridge for a few hours it tasted sooo much better.  I guess letting it sit for a while makes a difference. (I tend to slice off a piece or two of anything I bake right after it gets out of the oven hehe) I made 1/2 the batch and added more walnuts and bananas. This was a great recipe!

Great banana bread!  I didn't have the buttermilk so I just used plain milk and added about 1/2 cup more mashed banana.  I agree that it needs more nuts than just the 1/2 cup of walnuts.  Regardless, this was outstanding, and my oldest daughter is asking when I will be making this again.

I think buttermilk in any recipe adds a special flavor to it.  This bread is moist and delicious.  I found I had to bake it at least 1/2 hour more but it was well worth it!  Was searching for a moist and delicious recipe and finally6 found it.

I used butter instead of shortening and added a dash of nutmeg. I didn’t measure the bananas I just mashed up 5 because I needed to use them and I also used walnuts instead of pecans and I didn’t measure them either. I cooked it in 2 dark glass Pyrex loaf pans for 1.5 hours at 350 degrees as directed. Delicious!!!

First time I have made BNB in a long, long time. This was hands down the best! Very moist. I used very ripe bananas and think this helped w the moisture. I am about to make it again and think I may make muffins this time.

Very moist and great taste.  Different from what my Grandson was used to but he did like it too.  Made him a loaf to take back to college with him.

Used one cup regular sugar and one cup brown sugar. Used three bananas, and butter instead of shortening. My two loaves were gone in less than two days. Wonderfully moist and delicious. Will definitely make again soon.

I added 3 whole bananas to this recipe and added a chunk of cream cheese to each muffin and about 1/8 of a bar of cream cheese to the small loaf pans. I also used regular butter(unsalted) —about 2Tbs to the batter and used regular 2% white lactose free milk instead of using buttermilk.

For some reason this turned out dry. I should have added some sour cream or apple sauce. I didn't have enough mashed banana,  which was my fault, but I still think it would have been dry .

Delicious and super moist!
I did ended up making my own buttermilk by adding  two teaspoons of white vinegar and one teaspoon of lime juice to the whole milk. (Stir well) We embellished the recipe by added 1 teaspoon cinnamon and half cup of raisins. Let me add that we had an extra over ripped banana, so we used it... total of 5 sm./med. size bananas.

I only made half a recipe because I only had 1 banana.  I did use pecans instead of walnuts.  It was awsome.   This is the best Banana nut bread I have ever eaten.

I want to like this recipe, I really do, but something happened and really believe I made the recipe to the T.

The batter was thin and cake-like, I actually thought that it was going to make it into a wonderful loaf.  

Unfortunately, it rose (yes, that's normal) and ran over the sides of my pans, smoking out my house.  Thankfully it's in 30's right not outside now, not in the negatives like it has been outside because I had to open up the door to get the smoke detectors to stop.  

Since I want this recipe to work, I vow to try it again.  I will still be nervous about using two loaf pans next time because I don't want another smoke disaster, so I might put some batter in a 3rd, smaller pan.   

I will update this review when I re-make.

This is the best and moistest banana bread I've ever had. It even beats out my grandmothers and she had excellent banana bread. It was super easy to make, recipe gives you 2 loaves, but I'm telling you, double or triple it because when it starts baking, people are going to be lining up. Really good!!!

Lovely, after reading the reviews and realizing that I was out of all-purpose flour and  not in the mood to run to the store at that moment, I made it using self rising flour, I split the sugars  1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar. This is incredible!!!!!! Its delicate, moist, flavorful and I can't wait for my guys in Sunday School to try it  in the morning with the pineapple cream cheese frosting I'm adding to it. I believe that will seriously enjoy their Fathers day treat.

Loved it so much. I used 1 1/2 cups brown sugar instead of 2 1/2 c white sugar. Also used I cube of butter and 11/2 c applesauce for the shortening. It was wonderful. Can't get my friends to stop asking for recipe

This recipe is amazing! I've never made banana nut bread before and it was relatively simple. I did make the recommended changed (added cinnamon and nutmeg and did half white sugar and half brown). I only had 3 bananas - two extremely ripe and 1 that's was only a couple of days old. But the bread turned out perfectly. I was thinking of giving a loaf away but I'm certainly reconsidering now! Yum!! Highly recommend.

I  used this recipe for my first banana nut bread and used the recipe with no substitutions.   Turned out perfect and received many complements.  The bread was moist and it looked appetizing.   I will definitely use this recipe again!

Delicious! To save on fat and calories, I used1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce and 1/2 cup shortening, and cut the sugar to 2 cups. I think you could go to 1-3/4 cups sugar and it will still be sweet enough.

I ended up liking this bread better than I thought I would, though I did make some modifications.  I used half butter and half shortening, cut the sugar back by a half cup and used honey for half of the remaining sugar, and only 1C of buttermilk.  Also needed to substitute pecans for walnuts.  The batter was very light and fluffy, and so was the finished bread.  Nice flavor, nice texture, moist, but not soggy.  Good bread!

Very good recipe.  I added an extra banana since they were small.  Baked it about 10 extra minutes .  Very moist and the buttermilk makes a difference with taste.  I used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar.  What makes this a good bread is it is not too sweet, adding some cream cheese on a slice is oh so good.

Awesome!! So moist and so good good! LOL The easiest dessert I've made in a long time. This is definitely a new favorite. A few reviews stated it was a bit sweet so I just did 2 1/4 cups of sugar (a minor deduction) but it was perfect!

I did make a few changes to the recipe and I think it came out really well. I lowered the amount of sugar used by about 1/2 a cup. I also switched out one cup of white granulated sugar for light brown sugar. I used whole milk rather than buttermilk since it was what I had on hand. I got two good half loaves out of it and I got many many more compliments on it. My mother loved it and she's pretty picky. It is a great recipe!

This is my absolute favorite! The first time I made it it I followed the directions to a "T", and it was great. However, I decided I would try it the next time with some of the other reviews recommendations. 
I used 1 cup white sugar and 1 1/2  brown sugar. I also added a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg! 
This is a constant please make request!

Very good recipe. I doubled everything except the sugar. I put in only 3 cups of sugar. The shortening I changed to 1/2 butter(1 cup)and 1/2 (1 cup) shortening. I made 2 loaves, 4 small loaves, and 20 mini cupcakes. All delicious and not too sweet.

I cooked this yesterday for a family dinner.  There is hardly any left.  I also cut the sugar by 1/2 cup and used brown and white.  Wanted to use 1/2 shortening and 1/2 butter, but was out of shortening so used all butter.  Did not have any buttermilk so did the cider vinegar thing and was afraid the vinegar was going to overpower everything, but it turned out ok.  I saw that someone else said theirs also collapsed in the center, does this always happen?  How do I prevent it from happening in the future?

I also made cream cheese frosting for the top.  Will definitely make it again, but hope to prevent it from sinking in the middle.

This smelled so good while cooking in the oven.  I took the suggestion from JANICER8 and reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup, used pecans, and 1/2 brown sugar 1/2 white sugar.  I used unbleached flour and may need to add more moisture next time to get the same results as the other reviewers.  It tasted really good, I hardly want to give away the second loaf.

I used butter. I followed a previous suggestion and pureed 1/4c walnuts mixed with 1/4c brown sugar for a prebake topping. I made muffins (24) so cook time reduced to 20 min. Awesome.

I ALWAYS follow this recipe MINUS 1/2 cup sugar and my family and coworkers absolutely love it!! Tonight, I substituted yogurt for the buttermilk as I didn't have any and my outer body of my bread was overcooked and I didn't like it as much as I liked how I normally do it. Maybe I will try the milk and lemon substitution but I can't say the yogurt was a "HIT."  I have to remember when my bananas are out longer than expected to pick up buttermilk for this recipe! DEF A MUST TRY! =)

This was the best banana nut bread I've ever had! I only wanted to make 1 loaf, so I cut the recipe in half. I took the advice of other reviews & cut down on the sugar. Instead of 1 1/4 cup sugar for 1 loaf, I just used 1 cup. Perfect!!!

This was a delicious recipe. I made quite a few changes due to what I had available. It still turned out very moist an tasty.  I used self rising flour (only because I was out of all purpose) so I didn't add the baking soda or baking powder. I also don't own a loaf pan so I used a large glass pan and simply lowered my cooking temp to 325 degrees. I used 1c white sugar an 1c brown sugar ( I will likely cut that in half next time). I also used unsalted butter instead of shortening. I will definitely make this again!!

I made it as presents for my Dad and Aunt.  Both of them enjoyed it.  I snuck a piece from my dad's stash and I found it was very moist.  I would probably use a 1/2 cup more of mashed banana for more banana flavoring.  All in all I was excited about the recipe!

This was really good! I took the advice from JANICER8 altering the sugar to only 2 cups with 1/2 brown and 1/2 white, 4 bananas, butter instead of shortening, and adding 2 tbs cinnamon. I also used a few tbs of sour cream. Best banana bread i've made.

Wonderful Recipe!! First time ever making anything from scratch and I couldn't be more thrilled! I accidently misread the recipe and added 2c. of bananas instead of 1 1/2c. This is an awesome, easy recipe!! I will be making this often! I might even continue to use 2c. banana! Two loaves with 4adults and 2teens in my house, the bread didn't last but 2 1/2 days!!

Substituted Shortenings with 2 sticks of butter. The taste and texture is good. But, it is a bit dense and also collapses.

Very good banana bread.  I would give it 5 stars, but I made a few small tweaks that improved the recipe as written, IMO.  First, I decreased the sugar a little, and used both white and brown sugar.  I also increased the bananas to 2 cups for 2 loaves.  This made a moist, flavorful bread with a great crust on the outside.  Next time I might try it with butter instead of shortening.  Thanks!

This recipe was fantastic!  I used butter in place of the shortening, but the rest of the recipe was the same.  The loaves were just the right size, and were so moist!  This is better than my family recipe.

Followed the recipe exactly, it made 2 loaves but neither one got "done" in the middle...used regular loaf pans.  Couldn't bake any longer or they would have burned around the edges.  Should I put less dough in the 2 loaves, then put the extra in a mini loaf??  Mercy but they smelled good ... I just cut out the middles!!

This recipe was easy and delicious.  It's forgiving of not having enough bananas, moist, flavorful, and very pretty!  I shall make it whenever I have to get rid of elderly bananas!

Wow, this stuff is amazing.  My husband now hides the bananas so they will turn ripe before my kids see them. My mother who hates banana ("hate" isn't a strong enough word) even ate it and loved it.  I make the recipe exactly as written but at least 3 batches at a time.  Love it, Thanks!!!

i chose this recipe because i had excess buttermilk burning a hole in my fridge. i didn't have any walnuts on hand so i substituted half a bag of chocolate chunks and the results were quite good! very moist and sweet. i also sprinkled the loaves with powdered sugar once they came out of the oven, as if the recipe needed more sugar ;) 
simply put, this recipe is sinfully delicious!

Excellent flavor, but crumbly, so slices need to be very thick...also a bit unhealthy because of the amount of shortening and sugar.

this recipe is awesome, the only changes I made were substituted the shortening with margerine and devided the vanilla extract into half vanilla extract and half artificial banana flavored extract.  It is extremely but not too moist and was loved by all.  I also added a few more walnuts.

Great bread:) I did cut the sugar to 2 cups (this is plenty!). used butter flavor crisco. Added 2 t cinnamon and 1/2 t nutmeg. Toasted nuts before adding. Wrapped and refrigerated overnight to let the flavors really blend. Perfect!!

Like many reviewers, I cut down the shortening and sugar. To make it even healthier, I  used egg whites and and a mixture of white and oat flour.  The results were fantastic.

Adequate, but not impressive.  Bread was moist with good texture -- not as heavy/greasy as some banana breads I've had which was a plus.  Banana flavor was quite mild, which was a minus, but could have been due in part to my rushing to make this before my bananas were fabulously brown.  Also, not nearly nutty enough -- I should have used at least a cup.  Note: I made 7 mini-loaves, though this recipe could easily make 8, and decreased sugar to 2 cups, and added spice.

This was the BEST banana nut bread I have ever eaten (& I've eaten a lot!)  I used black walnuts, which went great with the buttermilk.  It was super moist and GREAT tasting!

We've made this bread a few times now 
because my family loves banana bread.  I like 
using buttermilk, I think it adds richness to it.  Seems to 
require longer times in the oven than the recipe 
states.  Very good, very moist bread.  Added
chocolate chips as a variation which turned out well
too.

This was the best banana nut bread.  I did add about 1 cup more nuts though.  One of my loaf pans is smaller so I also made 10 muffins.  Great as a muffin also for those rushed mornings.

This bread is the bomb! Very moist.  My husband loves it, the kids love it, and everyone else who has had it loves it. It's delicious with or without the nuts.

I had bananas about to go really bad.  My husband hs never had banana nut bread.  He loved it.  It is more cake consistency than bread...we have it in the freezer for emergency drop by visitors!

Everyone who tasted the bread loved it. The only thing I recommend is using at least a whole cup of nuts instead of Just half a cup.  I used 1 and 1/2 and it turned out great
