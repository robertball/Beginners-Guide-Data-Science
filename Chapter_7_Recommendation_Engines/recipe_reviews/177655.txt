Served at my daughter-in-law’s birthday dinner - these were a big hit - I made a few changes - partly because of what I had on hand - did not have any cereal so used some ½ bread crumbs and ½ shredded cheese.  Added some of the black pepper but could not use the red pepper due to allergies - I gave them about a minute or two under the broiler to give them a bit more brown - they were tender, moist and oh so tasty.  Even a couple of picky eaters who tried them really liked them.

I really liked the healthy alternative to this baked chicken recipe by using the chicken stock instead of eggs.  I used turkey tenders (as that was what I had in the freezer) and made turkey fingers instead of the cutlets.  The only suggestion I have is to flip the meat about half way through so it doesn't get soggy on the bottom.

I changed the chicken stock to sour cream thinned with mikk from another recipe and it worked well. Also baked the breasts on parchment paper to use  no oil and drizzeled melted butter over them before baking them.  Turned out great.

This is a great no-fry crunchy chicken dinner!  I made it for my normally picky husband and he loved it.  I actually used garlic & butter croutons for the coating.  I also baked 10 min each side, then broiled for an additional 2 minutes for extra crunchiness.

The chicken stayed very moist and I liked the breading. However, next time I make this, I will make the following changes: 1. don't crush the corn flakes as finely - I think it will have more interesting texture, mine wasn't crispy, 2. add herbs for more flavor. Otherwise, good dish.

This is good.  I doubled the mixture, because I had chicken strips, instead.  It worked out well.

My family simply didn't like... perhaps it was the Kellogg's brand of cornflakes. I tried to disguise the taste by turning it into chicken sandwiches.  Failed  =(

For how easy, cheap and quick to prepare this recipe is, it is definitely worthy of a five star rating. I added some italian seasoning as another had mentioned, and it was so good! Will definitely be adding this to the dinner rotation.

this recipe rates high for a lot of reasons, namely how quick it is to make, it uses common ingredients i usually have, and it's pretty healthy.  my only change was to dip the chicken in milk instead of broth, but i don't think that impacted the flavor.  the downfall that keeps this recipe shy of 5 stars is the blandness - the garlic powder and pepper isn't enough to flavor the breading.  if i were to make this again, i'd add some italian seasoning, salt, paprika, etc to give the chicken some more ooomph.  but in the end, the kids helped me make it and then enjoyed eating it, so i'm happy!  and fyi, the breading does stay pretty crunchy, but as others have said i think a flip midway thru is a good idea, or throwing the broiler on the last few mins would help too.

Very good, Husband LOVES this. I do change what seasonings I use depending on what sounds good or what I have at the time. Its great as is, or to use as a base and change it up a little to suit your taste. 

Thank you

Per other reviews I added italian seasoning and only used half the red pepper.  It was still a little bit spicy and my husband and daughter didn't like it but they are pretty picky.  I thought it was pretty good and would have given a higher rating but they didn't like it.

This recipe worked great for me, especially since I have to be gluten free and GF corn flakes are much cheaper than GF flour. I always pre-soak my chicken in buttermilk which this recipe didn't call for and I did add eggs to the chicken broth because the flakes were not sticking as well as I like them too. Other than that I didn't make any changes. The chicken was juicy and tender on the inside and crunchy and tasty on the outside. It was super easy to make compared to the pan frying method! It'll definitely make the rotation in our household.

I love love love oven fried chicken. I use sour cream to coat the chicken, it helps keep the "breading" on better. I also added minced fresh garlic to the mixture. Next time I'm thinking I'll add some freshly grated parmesan to it as well, making a big batch of this chicken ahead of time makes a quick chicken parm for another night even quicker :)

My family gives it a 5. I think it turned out delicious but kind of tasted like I dredged the chicken in Top Ramen. :) The chicken broth IS the healthy way to do it though. I will definitely be making this again!

The only cereal I had on hand that resembled corn flakes was Smart Start....they were a little sweeter but my family loved them! Even my picky chicken-nugget eaters gobbled them up!

I used Kellog's crushed flakes and it tasted too much like crushed cereal.  I would try a different brand.

After reading other reviews, I modified the recipe substituting Zesty Italian Salad Dressing (cheap Savalot brand) instead of chicken broth for the wash.  20 minutes @400 F did not do it for cooking.  The cornflakes started to brown so I covered the pan with foil and cooked another 45 minutes @325F.   I would do this again.

how easy!  I didn't crush my corn flakes to a finer crumb, but left some visible pieces.  Added some onion powder to the mix and a couple shakes of cayenne.  Sprayed some Pam on the top to help with crunch and baked them on a rack instead of directly on the pan.  No soggy underside!   it's really all in whatever spices you want to add to the corn flakes.  Also didn't use  chicken stock after reading other reviews, so I used one egg and a little bit of water instead and it worked beautifully!

I am a picky person eater but my husband seemed to enjoy it. I did realize I was out of broth when I went to make it so I used sour cream directly on the chicken. I also added extra spices to the recipe. I used extra red pepper and added salt and paprika.

It was moist and crunchy!  However it did need salt, pepper, and maybe some additional seasoning. But it is a good way to prepare oven fried chicken!

I didn't have any ground red pepper so I used paprika instead. Turned out delicious! The only thing I'd suggest is baking in a roasting pan on a rack so the underside doesn't get soggy when the chicken releases its juices.

This was very good. Due to dietary reasons I only did the corn flakes, garlic powder and added rosemary. I didn't use chicken stock but sprayed the breasts with pam to get the dry mixture to stick.

This was a good recipe to try. I liked the easy preparation & crunchy bite. The only change I made was I used egg because the crumbs were not sticking to the chicken with just the broth. I'll make this again!

Tasted Fabulous!, I had to cook my chicken at 50 because it was was burning at 400, and then increased cooking time to 40 minutes. I also added some dried pepper flakes and serviced with a curried Rice :) Tasted delicious, I just wish the crust would have stayed on the chicken better!!

This was quick and easy and I would recommend to anybody. Family enjoyed it and I added a tablespoon of olive oil to the pan to make it crisp up even more.

nothing special here.  maybe I just don't like chicken breast, but it came out dry and tasteless for me.  I doubt I will make again, which is a shame... I bought a whole box of corn flakes specifically for this!

These were simply awesome.  I try to be a healthy eater, and these were gone in minutes because my hubby couldn't keep his fingers off of them.  I added a bit more hot pepper flakes because we like spicey. :)
