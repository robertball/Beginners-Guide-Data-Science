Very bland. Needed a lot of salt and pepper added. Probably would do good with some more spices. I would make it again just adding some things! Maybe some chicken. My husband complained about not having meat.

We used brown rice instead of white perhaps this is where it all went wrong?!?

If how I made this was the intended result then it's really a 1 or a 2 but since I used fat free milk and left out the salt and used a tiny bit of liquit mint instead of dry since I can't find dry mint here. So I'm going with a 3 since I probably just substituted too much and if I can find dried mint I'll give it another try using buttermilk. Update: This soup cannot be saved for later leftovers in the fridge in sealed containers separated and smelled heavily of flour. Changing review to 1.
