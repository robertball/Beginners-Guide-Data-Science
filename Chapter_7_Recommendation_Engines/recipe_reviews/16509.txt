This recipe was easy to prepare except for the wild rice, which I have not made often.  Make sure it is really soft before using it or it comes out hard after baking.  Also,  I think cake is a more accurate description than bars.  A good cake though.

I used up my brown rice instead of using wild rice, and I used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose flour.  These are a moist bar with good flavor!  If you didn't realize the rice was there, for the most part, you don't even taste it!  I frosted half of the bars with Browned Butter Coffee Frosting--DELICIOUS!

These were pretty simple to make and if the raw batter is any indication of how they will taste--I'm looking forward to it!
It smells like Christmas right now!
If you don't have a 10x15 pan, as I don't 
you can use a 9x13, but, you will need to increase the baking time. 
It may seem like work, but, this is definitely worth the effort. 
If you use a 9x13 pan, it will be cake like but still good.
Enjoy!!

A great way to use leftover rice.  I This is a great way to use leftover rice.  I used brown rice, olive oil, and only half the suggested sugar.  Also added some walnuts and substituted pumpkin pie spice for all other spices.   A high fiber, not too sweet snack for my 3 year old son.  He love it!

They were pretty good.  People thought it was carrot cake.  I frosted it with cream cheese frosting.  I found the wild rice bits to be a bit chewy and obtrusive.

I love it if I had made it thinner instead of loafs & cupcakes it would had been an ginger bread cookie :) sticky chewy but not over done.  It's an large recipe feeds several.  I only had 2 people 1 recipe produced one  large loaf 12 cupcakes.
