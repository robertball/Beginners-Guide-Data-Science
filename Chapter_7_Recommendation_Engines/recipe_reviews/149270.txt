I was very satified with the taste of this cookie.  I think it could have used more flavor though.  But other than that I would reccomend this.

Loved these!!!  I made these with my Girl Scout Troop for Thinking Day!   They were hard to roll out at first. I made a double batch and made most of these up with the girls helping.  We ran out of time and I had to finish the next day with my Daughter.  It was so much easier after being in the Fridge overnight - Will add this recipe to my Holiday collection -already decided to use this as Teacher gifts Christmas 2011!!

This recipe made light tasting cookies, great for tea, but I wouldn't know since they don't last that long! Added a glaze of lemon juice, vanilla, and powdered sugar.

Very good! Had a nice lemon twist to otherwise fairly bland sugar cookies. Loved the unique taste! Next time I would've used a little more sugar.. just to make it less bland. But they were really good.Made them for my French class!
