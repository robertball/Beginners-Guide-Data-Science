This has a great flavor combination with the spice and length of simmering the semolina.  I did not add any honey or other sweetener cuz it had its own sweet taste!  I briefly thought about not using as much milk as stated, but put it all in anyhow.  It was a bit thin so next time I'll decrease it a little bit.  All in all, I'm very much liking this and will be using it again, maybe adding some dried fruit in too.!  Thanks a lot, Wbolesnyc, for this post!

Threw in 2 star anise once the water started to boil, only added 2 cups of milk and was adding sugar until my boyfriend told me that this wasn't supposed to have any.  I first thought it was supposed to be just like the cream of wheat that i grew up eating.  Made this while our dinner of fresh homemade stuffing, sweet corncake, herbed chicken breast and yam and kale salad was in the oven.          When dinner was ready, my boyfriend chose to eat this instead!!!!    He's from Morocco and said that traditionally they would put olive oil on top. I can see how this recipe would be good for those who cannot chew their food, have upset stomachs or need to get nutrition on a budget; good breakfast or snack. Great, simple recipe.
