A little bit spicy...a little bit savory! For a simple recipe this dish was pretty good. Just use a light hand on the red pepper flakes. My only change was to use whole tomatoes rather than diced, but that's a personal preference. Enjoy!  UPDATE...After dinner tonight I caught my girlfriend eating all of the shrimp out of the tupperware while standing in front of the refrigerator. Now all I'm left with is spicy tomato sauce. She will be punished!

I was looking for a pasta dish with shrimp and red sauce, and this fit the bill.  I really enjoyed the flavor of the sauce; it would be nice even without the shrimp.  Fast and fresh tasting.

This recipe was wonderful. I was not able to get fresh shrimp so I used frozen and I did not have fresh basil so I used 1/2 tablespoon dried and it was very good. My kids loved it, Will absolutley make it again.

I liked this recipe, it turned out great. But I used green and red peppers instead of mushrooms (don't like mushrooms). My boyfriend liked it, I use him all the time to try out new food. If he likes it, then it's a good recipe.

This was pretty basic and easy to assemble.  As with many recipes like this, it actually tasted better the second day when the flavors had a chance to all come together.

This recipe was great! I made some small changes to the recipe:
1. I didn't use spaghetti pasta, instead Angel hair pasta. 
2. instead of the 3 tablespoons of tomato paste, I used about half of the small can to get it the sauce to the thickness I liked so that it wouldn't be so watery. 
3. I omitted the sugar, and mushrooms. 
4. Instead of just regular can of diced tomatoes, I got the Zesty diced tomatoes with bits of chiles in it for spice. 
Though my boyfriend didn't really care for the recipe (he's a picky eater) it was really good.  Loved it, and I'll be making it for myself again.

This was really great!  My almost 2 year old gobbled it up :)  The only problem with this recipe was that it really needed some salt!  I added maybe 1/4 to 1/2 tsp?  I did drain one can of the tomatoes and replaced the liquid with 1/2 cup of white wine.  I ended up simmering the sauce a lot longer before I returned the shrimp to the pan because the water for the pasta took like an hour to boil.  Didn't want the shrimpies to get over cooked :)  Stirred in the fresh basil right before serving so that it wouldn't turn brown.  Loved it!

It was good.  Sauce is kind of watery, but overall good flavor.  Would be great with italian sausage as well.

Very good recipe, but I changed a coupl things.  Instead of oregano I used Italian seasoning, ommitted the onion and used about 1/4 teasp. of cajun seasoning.  My family loved it.

Great quick meal, only change I did was use fresh garden herbs in lieu of dry herbs. And added a yellow bell that needed to be used in something. Topped with Parmesan cheese.

Quick, Tasty and Easy. I didn't have canned diced tomatoes, so I just used 1 fresh tomato diced up by myself and added some water and white cooking wine to the sauce to make it "saucy", so that it wouldn't get too dry. It was amazing!!!!!

Great recipe. The only adjustments I made were I added zuchinni and squash for some color, I nixed the sugar, and used a whole can of tomato paste for a thicker sauce. Also added some water. Will definitely make again!

I made this recipe *almost* exactly as written.  The fresh herbs I bought were basil and oregano (pasta blend) so I used fresh oregano instead of dried and I used Fettucini instead of spaghetti.  The only other change was I added a touch of garlic powder to the sauce at the very end, I like garlic and if it weren't so close to being done at that point I would have added fresh garlic.  This was amazing!  I'll definitely be making this again.  Thanks for a great easy recipe!!

To make a lower fat version, use fat free/calorie free butter spray to saute with.  This dish was really awesome, and my husband loved it as well!

The pasta sauce was a little too runny but overall, the entire dish was delicious!!  Light but flavorful.  I'm definitely adding this to our dinner rotation.

I really liked this recipie. If you are looking for a healthier alternative it traditional meatsauce, this is it! I ate it with whole wheat pasta. I also made a couple changes that I think upped the flavor. First, I doubled the garlic and mushrooms. In order to keep the same sauce consistency, i used a whole can of tomato paste and then filled the can with water and added it. Then I added a bit of black and white pepper. Overall a really great recipie!

Really tasty! I added red and green bellpeppers.  Also used a jar of spaghetti sauce instead of diced tomatoes and paste because that's all I had. My husband and stepson practically inhaled it!

This was ok, but I won't make it again. There are better shrimp recipes on here, such as "szechwan shrimp".

I improvised quite a bit with this one, my sauce wasn't cooperating with me, so what I did was mixed it all together in one pot and tossed it like a salad, it turned out very good, I'll definitely try this again, hopefully my sauce will be nice to me next time

An excellent alternative to jarred spaghetti sauce. I've made this on at least three occasions and enjoyed it each time, including once when we used chicken instead of shrimp. Low sodium canned tomatoes work well.

Very yummy - didn't have mushrooms so used a fresh tomato, green pepper & fresh basil.  My husband liked it with the shrimp in it.  The red pepper flakes give it a little tang!

This dish was okay. I was really hoping for it to have a more full robust flavor, but it wasnt really there. It wasn't bad and we ate it but there was not rave reviews at the dinner table.  I don't know if I will make it again.

Cooked it pretty much like the recipe except I added more than 1/4 tsp of pepper flakes probably double that and I added them at middle of cooking the shrimp. Also no fresh basil tonight –the plants all froze last weekend so I used dried. Also, I used 1 cup of diced onions  instead of a ½ cup and 2 lbs of shrimp instead of 1  ½ lbs. Turned out great!  My husband and son devoured it. My 19 year old son says "Mom how come what cook tastes better than what chefs make who cook all day long". I'll take the compliment. Will definitely make this again!

Great recipe!  Didn't change a thing and loved it.  Terrific with shrimp, but would be good as is as just a tomato and mushroom sauce.

We enjoyed this immensely. I am always looking for good shrimp pasta dishes, and this one fit the bill. I agree that you might make more sauce by adding a can of tomato sauce and possibly another can of diced tomatoes

This is an excellent dish...It needs more sauce for my family's taste, so you might have to make more of the sauce to your liking...

I made this with all the ingredients called for, but adjusted the quantities so it was how we like them. Personally, I added the raw shrimp to the tomato mix, covered the pan, and let the shrimp cook in the sauce. I served it over anhel hair pasta with a sprinkle of freshly-snipped basil. Absolutely delicious. Thanks SO much!

This recipe was really tasty. I actually added 2 tablespoons of Jamaican jerk rub. I didnt use any sugar, but im sure it would've been just as good.

Made this tonight for my in-laws who are on a low-carb type diet and served it on slices of polenta instead of spaghetti. It was a big hit! I didn't have enough shrimp so I also threw in some chicken.  The sauce is substantial enough that even with eating very little polenta (due to the diet) they were satisfied and said it was delicious!  This is great recipe, thanks!

It's a simple tomato sauce shrimp pasta that tastes just like a regular tomato sauce pasta with shrimp. I personally still don't think tomato sauce and shrimp go too well together.

Super easy and delicious. My boyfriend actually liked it and he usually doesnt like the pasta dishes I make. Making it again tonight.  I used whole wheat pasta and it tasted just as delicious. I also added some veggies like zucchini and green peppers.
