We loved it and it really took me back "home"! I didn't add the butter, didn't think it needed the extra fat, and eliminated the lemon juice. All the other ingredients were combined and poured over the roast and the slow cooker did the rest. We had the typical cole slaw, baked beans and hush puppy sides and it was outstanding! This is the typical Eastern North Carolina style barbeque and delicious.

This was not the best NC BBQ I have ever had, but it was pretty darn good, and it was super easy to make. We will definitely be making this again.  I prepared this recipe exactly as written, and did not find it to Vinegary, Its North Carolina BBQ, that is what it is supposed to taste like.

my roast was 4.4 llbs. I used 1/4 cup vinegar, 3 TBS sugar, and little more each of lemon juice, hot sauce and pepper flakes (we like our stuff hot) and cooked on low for 9 hours before adding the sauce.  The meat fell apart and was to die for! I brought to work to have my coworkers sample I could not believe how yummy with such a small amount of ingredients.  Thanks alot!

So delicious and easy for this working mom! I didn't have rice vinegar so I used cider vinegar. I put lean pork chops in this recipe because the chops always turned out day and this recipe was wonderful. My son made the sauce after I got home and served it along with rice, his favorite. Now he wants to serve it to his sister and my nephew tomorrow night, however, we now have the pork shoulder!

To be honest, I’m certain that no one in North Carolina EVER used white vinegar or white sugar for that matter when preparing NC style BBQ. Next time try Apple Cider vinegar, as well as Brown Sugar. You’ll be amazed at the difference! Love the idea of the Red Pepper Flakes!

Let me preface this by saying that I really like vinegar. I really REALLY like vinegar. I eat vinegar in some form every day.   This recipe? Too much vinegar.

I used half the butter the recipe called for and for the vinegar, I used one cup of rice wine vinegar and one cup of white vinegar.  The rice wine vinegar makes it less tart.  Delish!

I agree with one post that this is not the best but darn good! It's a basic starter recipe. Carolina BBQ has always been a vinegar based sauce so NOT sure why some are saying too much vinegar!?  MY RECOMMENDATIONS: Make per recipe add more sugar to tame the vinegar. Also you don't have to pour the entire amount over the pork, use small amounts til your find you liking.   I added 1/4 cup brown sugar in addition to white. Also added more red peppers and hot sauce....we like it hot too! Also a little cayenne pepper & hickory smoke.

Fast, Easy and Fantastic! This is a must keep recipe! Add Coleslaw on top, I recommend the recipe on the back of the package of Dole Shredded Slaw. Turns a good meal into a great meal!

This was good.I used apple cider vinegar due to that is all I had, and more red pepper. I made it and it was ok. I let it sit overnight for a bbq the next day and it was great. If you don't like alot of spice this a good recipe, but it is easy to fix the spice to your liking. Thanks for the recipe I will make it for the next bbq I have.

Amazing! Perfect blend of tangy and spicy! I did a quick version of this using the precooked package of smoked pulled pork from Sam's Club. I put the pulled pork in a pan and followed this sauce recipe exactly as written. I simmered with a lid on for 30 min, stirring occationally, while the meat soaked up the sauce. Served on a sandwich bun with coleslaw. So good! Keeping this recipe for sure!

For this recipe I put the meat on the smoker with apple wood chunks for three hours and then placed it in the slow cooker with a cup of beef broth. After six hours I took the pork out and tossed the beef broth. I pulled the pork and put it back in the slow cooker. For the sauce, i reduce the salt by half and omitted the hot sauce.  I serve the hot sauce separately with Cole slaw.  I receive a lot of compliments on this one!

Didn't have the red pepper flakes, so I used 1/4 tsp. of cayenne  pepper. And to make it diabetic friendly, I used Splenda instead of sugar.
O
It was delicious.

We have served this at several cookouts.  It is wonderful!  Most of my guest have asked for the recipe, and have also had rave reviews from their guest.  I am from NC, and it is the best BBQ that I have eaten.  

I followed the recipe exactly.

This recipe was great.  I made a couple changes based on the reviews.  I used rice vinegar and brown sugar instead of white.  I only had a 2 pound pork butt so I cut the salt, sugar, pepper, red pepper and hot sauce in half.  I also only used 2 tablespoons of butter and 1/2 cup of rice vinegar.  With these modifications I found it to be very flavorful without being too vinegary.  The basic recipe is delicious and I would recommend this as an easy meal.

My husband loves nc barbeque so i tried this recipe and he loved it! I used half the vinegar though and a little less red pepper but it turned out perfect. My husband brags about it to everyone and this has become a family favorite for sure. Thank you for the recipe!

I absoultely, positivelly loved this. I am a giant fan of North Carolina BBQ. The tang of the vinegar along with the sweet and spice kick is like no other taste combo. It's just delicious.

Wow! I followed the recipe - although I had a boneless pork loin - and I can't believe how perfect it is! I thought it might be too hot with the hot sauce and red pepper flakes - but it turned out just right and is getting better by the day! I will definitely be making this on a regular basis!

Far too much vinegar, didnt taste like proper NC BBQ
