This is a quick standby for a classic Chinese dessert.  It took minutes to prepare and set within hours.  The only modification I made the first time round was to reduce the sugar from 3/4 to 2/3 cup.  It was still plenty sweet especially with canned fruit cocktail in syrup, so I may reduce the sugar a bit more the next time round.  Classic almond jello is made with agar agar, and I have yet to find a good recipe for this.  Gelatin has a slightly different texture, more spring and elasticity, but is a good substitute.  My toddler loves it, and it's a good way to get calcium in him!  The next times I try it, I will experiment with unsweetened soy instead of milk, using 3 cups milk to 1 cup water, substituting coconut milk for 1 cup of milk, etc.  This is a keeper!

As many have said, this isn't like the Asian-style almond jelly in texture because this recipe calls for gelatin as opposed to agar-agar (sp.?). However, it is tasty and a great addition to a fruit salad whether you're using fresh or canned fruit. I used only 1/2 cup of sugar (it was still plenty sweet; will use less next time) and 2 tsps. of almond extract.

I love to add fruit cocktails in this. I also halve the milk into 1 cup of milk, and substitute the other cup of milk of 1 cup of table cream milk (nestle kind). I noticed when I use kiwis or pineapple, they seem to become icky. I found that if I blanched fruits like kiwi, figs, guava, pineapple, gingerroot and papaya, the enzymes are gone.  Also, fruits in heavy syrup, fresh seedless grapes, canned peaches, canned pears, and fruit cocktail sink. Fresh fruit, fruit in light syrup, including fresh orange and lemon slices, sliced apples, peaches, or bananas float.

My family enjoyed this so much that I ended up making it twice this week! It's really good and easy to make. The only modification I made is that I used slightly less sugar (1/2 cup) the second time I made it, because I found the first try too sweet. We felt that it was still sweet enough with only 1/2 cup sugar.

I had a craving for this the other day and was SO happy to find this recipe.  I upped the almond to 2 tsp, cause I wanted to make sure it really had an almond flavour, and it was great.  The only thing I might change is to lessen the amount of liquid so that the jello is more firm.  Thanks for sharing!

This is so good, so refreshing.  I would suggest using the fruit cocktail with extra cherries "Very Cherry"  I believe its called.  I used whole milk, turned out perfect!

I couldn't find agar agar so I tried this gelatine-based recipe. I used less sugar too (1/2 cup) but still turned out to be too sweet. I also substituted part of the milk with evaporated milk (like 1/2 cup of evaporated milk and 1 1/2 cup of milk) to get a stronger milk taste but it probably added to the overall sweetness. And I used less water (like 1.75 cups in total) for a firmer texture. 

The traditional recipe with agar agar uses 1/4 oz agar powder, 2 cup water, 1/5 cup milk, 1/5 evaporated milk, and few drops of almond extract. Procedures are the same

Very nice and light. so easy to make. Served with fresh fruit salad. As per other reviews, I reduced the sugar to only 1/2 cup and it was sweet enough. I might use more gelatin next time.

Awesome! I loved this the first time I made it, making it again tonight! Tastes creamy yet firm and just the right amount of almond.

Delicious and refreshing. My family ate all immediately. I used only 1/2 cup of sugar in the gelatin, and topped each serving bowl with canned mandarin orange slices and some of the light syrup it comes with.

This recipe needs more gelatin and almond extract.  I waited for 4 hours and it was like pudding. There must be something missing out of this recipe. It probably is a good idea to try this recipe before having it with your friends.

I love this stuff.  Cut down the sugar as mentioned by others.   Second time I made it I actually used low fat milk and Splenda because I was trying to go low cal.  Of course it's not quite as good, but it was a very low cal treat.

My daughter and I love this. I did cut down the amount of sugar to 1/2C and the almond to 1t. The full amounts made it too sweet and too overwhelmingly almond. Otherwise, yum.

I followed the directions in this recipe but it didn't gel properly. After 4 hours in the refrigerator, I tried cutting the gelatine into cubes, but it was so wobbly. Much of it fell apart, leaving the final product (lychee syrup and all) cloudy.
It tasted ok, though. 
If I were to make it again, I would use less liquid, because I want my almond gel to hold its shape.

I replaced the sugar with 12 little packets of Pure Via brand stevia.

Easy to make and really easy to eat. My friends loved it.

Very adaptable. Cut down the sugar to 1/4 cup and used 1/4 cup equivalent Splenda ( 6 packets). Used 1 cup unsweetened almond milk and 1 cup whole milk. Increased  almond flavoring to 3 teaspoons and added a dash of salt. Used a shallow rectangular glass pan to cut the gelatin into cubes. Refreshing with canned lychees and pitted sweet Bing cherries. Better than ice cream and probably healthier.
