I made this pretty much as-is with two very slight variations.  I subbed zucchini in for the mushrooms, and instead of vegetable stock, I used chicken stock.  This recipe takes a little while, but it's worth it!  Extremely fresh-tasting with all the veggies.  I actually really liked the lemon zest and thought it could have used a bit more.  Oh, one somewhat major change: I didn't have shredded parmesan, so instead I did a little less than 1/4C of grated parm.  Seemed to work out just fine, but I really want to try it the right way next time.  As a side, it makes A LOT, but we used it as a meatless dinner. Lots of leftovers!  Will definitely be making this again.

First time ever making risotto, and my wife and I absolutely loved it! I didn’t have shallots, so I substituted two small vidalia onions and about 1 1/2 tablespoons of crushed garlic (fresh). I was low on red cherry tomatoes, so I added what I had left in the yellow ones. I thought it gave it nice colors with the green asparagus (which I doubled from what the recipe calls for). This will be a favorite despite the need to watch it closely as you add 1 cup of broth at a time to allow it to absorb.… Worth it!

This could have been really good without the lemon zest and maybe use chicken stock instead of vegetable stock! I plan on making it again with a those tweaks! Thanks for the recipe!

It was a tasty treat.  I modified the base recipe by grilling some prosciutto and folding it in at the end.  Perfect combination.

This was really delicious! Creamy, and a cheap, yet large amount of food. One thing I'd make sure before making this is that the rice should be uncooked. I didn't know that and put in cooked rice, only to get it kind of soggy like rice porridge.

This was a great recipe and has a few elements that come together nicely.  I really enjoy risotto and this is the first recipe that I made that didn't require more liquid than the recipe called for.  It really does require that medium low heat so the liquid has time to be absorbed.  The orange zest and tomato were very complimentary and we will definitely be making this again!
