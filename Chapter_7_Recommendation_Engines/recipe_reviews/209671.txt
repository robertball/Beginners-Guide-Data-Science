Quick, simple, cheap - a great busy weeknight meal. The kids devoured it, and it felt better than giving them a box of mac n' cheese. I used ground turkey instead of beef this time. I'll be using this dish often, I think!

I personally didn't like it as it stood.  Bland. Very kid friendly!  So I tinkered with it for a more adult flavor.  I still didn't like it much.  Could only find Cheddar Cheese and Broccoli. thin sliced carrots Red Pepper Flakes 1 c Cheddar/Monterey Jack Cheese with milk to make a cream sauce  Dash of hot pepper sauce shake of garlic powder My son liked it.  He had seconds.  "Interesting and different." My husband liked it as a change but not something to have often.   I think I just had a vision of a flavor and nothing provided it. 3 stars for adults...4 1/2 stars for children.

Every single member of our 6-person family LOVED this. Not a single complaint from all 4 kids, ages 4-9, (which is rare) and everyone ate it all up. Great recipe! Thanks!

This is a really good recipe. Even our picky 3 year old liked it and wanted seconds. Great use of the Knorr side dish. The only addition was about 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese, and salt and pepper.

Not as cheesy as I had hoped but still good for a quick supper. This is like hamburger helper except not as saucy.

Very good!! Could use a little more flavor, maybe next time I'll add some red pepper flakes or something similar. But will definitely make again!! And it was family approved!!
