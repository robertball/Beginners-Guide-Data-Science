We tried this last weekend and it was awesome!  Our guests love it too, 2 gallons made...2 gallons drank!  I could not find raspberry soda so I used regular club soda and soaked fresh raspberries in it for 30 minutes before using it.  Great recipe and I'll make it again for my dad's birthday next month!

Made this tonight to sip on the patio, it was so good, very fruity and refreshing. The perfect blend of flavors for a Sangria. My husband loves Sangria's and this is his new favorite it's irresistible! Thanks for sharing! If you are making this for a group, make sure you double it.

Awesome and simple!  I added 1/2 the sugar and a cup of cranberry/pomegranate juice.  Got huge compliments!  I'd also recommend freezing cranberries to chill it instead of ice.  Makes a nice fall touch!

Easy and absolutely delicious!  I doubled the recipe and it was a good thing as my book club girls drank it up!
