Save yourself and easy 45 minutes and put the sweet potato in the microwave for 3 1/2 minutes! Changed up a few more things. Only used 1 can of black beans, left out the mustard and used 1/2 cup of panko bread crumbs in place of the oats. After I made the patties I dredged them in more panko's so they would be crispy on the top. Only using one can of black beans, it still made 6 (thinner) patties. When it was done, I chose not to put on a roll but instead put mango salsa on top....OMG.... delish!!!

I was actually surprised that these patties held together, considering there is just 1/2 cup of oats as a binder... but they do hold together well.  The flavor is great - the added cinnamon is a great idea that brings out the other spices very nicely.  To give it a bit more of a smoky, meaty flavor, I added 1/2 teaspoon each of garlic powder and smoked Spanish paprika.  This was a hit with the family!

It needs a little more spice to it. I did bake it but mine didnâ€™t come out as chard as I would have like it to be. I think baking it is fine but you should finish it on a grill to get that nice crispy outside like a regular burger gets. Also when you mash the beans, leave some whole and it will add another layer to it.

These really have a great flavor.  I cooked them a little longer and a bit higher temp at the end so they would be nice and crispy on the outside.

these weren't bad at all, on par with black bean burgers I've had in restaurants. I think this is something you could play with to fit your own tastes. I actually used curry powder & garam masala bc I love those flavors, and it worked well. Once the patties are cooled, they stick together surprisingly well.  Next time I might try adding hemp seeds or similar to give it a nuttier flavor. Edamame would also be good to up the protein content a bit

I would make it again only using 1 can of beans.  I think the burger would not be as dry

This was delicious! I made the black beans from scratch. I wanted to puree the beans so I had to add 1/2 cup of the bean water to the mixture to get my blender to blend. Then I added an additional 1/2 cup of oatmeal to compensate for the water.

I cooked them in a cast iron pan so I wouldn't heat up my kitchen with the oven. The burgers didn't get super firm but they were FANTASTIC!

The recipe made 7 burgers each made with 1/2 cup of mix.

I made it without adding salt, and it was pretty yummy.  It didn't knock me out of the park with the flavor, personally-- but everyone who ate it enjoyed it, and I received several compliments!

Tasted great.. easy to make.  Only thing was the cooking time for me was way off... Baked for 20-25 minutes per side.. when I tried to turn ~ 8 minutes it was still far too soft to flip.
