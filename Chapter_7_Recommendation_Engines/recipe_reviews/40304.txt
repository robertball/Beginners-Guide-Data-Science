I used this for a Halloween party, it made alot and was gone quickly. In PA where I live you cant buy grain alchol so I used 100 proof vodka and it was still great! I did add a can of frozen pinapple concentrate and floated slices of lime and orange on top. We also had frozen hands with gummy worms inside, floating around as well. It had quite a kick and was still really good! Fantastic!!!

I had a house party of about 20 adults, all seasoned drinkers, and the whole house was on tilt. If you couple this with jello shots, it's all good in the hood. I also got the jello shot recipe off the site.

Added sherbert and green food coloring as recommended.  Was a great party drink.  (Above picture is by me, it won't turn out that frothy and green unless you add the sherbert and food coloring)

Was a big hit, wouldn't change a thing but you might want to warn your guests-while strong, I don't think many people realized just how much of a pack it punched.

I could not find lime concentrate at the grocer. Instead of lime I used pineapple. To still stay true to the flavor, I added lime sherbet to give it a more frothy consistency and to keep it cold. It was great because you couldn't really taste the alcohol but after you stopped sipping and took a moment you could definitely FEEL it. I did only use 3/4 of the grain alcohol though and it was MORE than enough, especially towards the end of the batch.

Made this as directed, but I used vodka, added neon green food coloring, and floated frozen hands in the punch bowl.  It looked like nuclear waste.  Everyone loved it.  Gave you a good kick too!

I was skeptical about how good this was going to be but I liked that it was easy and made a lot since we were having a party. But it was great! We added scoops of rainbow sherbet which added some more flavor and kept it nice and cold. Plus it melts into a film on top that looks cool. It tasted great - people couldn't get enough! (Also, for halloween we made an ice brain mold that I dyed red with food dye - bought the mold at Target - it looked awesome floating in the greenish punch!)

In our 4 years of Halloween parties, this was the only punch we ever ran out of.  It was a huge success!

Made this for a friend's birthday party and it was a huge hit. I used a few types of flavored rum and also added pineapple sherbet which added more flavor and kept it looking extra swampy. Love it :)

This is a really great punch. However the punch that it packs is a little to strong for me.  I used 5 Dt. Mtn Dews and the rest of the ingredients and it was still very potent! For a longer party I suggest doubling all ingredients except the 190 proof.  The taste is great!

I don't even like his kind of soda and loved this!  We used vodka and added it to those that wanted it so those that didn't want to drink could still enjoy it.  Very citrusy, very puckery but no one had a problem with that!!  It was all gone by the end of the evening!!

I made this for our Halloween party last night and it was a big hit. We made three batches. Based on other reviewer's suggestions, we substituted 80 proof vodka for the grain alcohol and added rainbow sherbert. It was kind of like an alcoholic creamsicle. I don't always like sweet drinks, but it was a nice treat. It was also potent, so I warned my guests to watch out.

Too sweet!  Made a pitcher for ghouls-nite cocktail party & didn't get rave reviews. However, I am thinking about doubling the alcohol only & using it for shooters @ our big Halloween party.

Looks like a swamp. Shrek would be proud. But also looks like vomit scraped off the floor from a concert in Vegas

Ahh!! I made this for my Halloween Party last night! I made two batches for 20 people and it was gone by the end of the night. I put in green food coloring and it was spooky and delightful. I used diet Sierra Mist so it wouldn't be super sweet. Best party ever. Will make for my Christmas party and add red food coloring with green cups. :)

This punch was a huge hit. It is very powerful!!!! but thats the point!!! I used 80 proof vodka & only 2 bottles of soda. Next time I will use 3 bottles of soda. The only thing is that it is very citrusie (sp?) , so if you get heartburn easily I would be careful. It needs something to calm down the citrus.If anyone has any ideas about that please post. But over all a GREAT punch for adults!! & Lots of fun to play around with.

People drank it.  But opted for other items on the bar first.  I probably won't make it again.
