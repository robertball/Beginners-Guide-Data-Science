This recipe is delicious is just different from the classic colombian arepa. But its so tasty, that definitely worth to try...Only one thing use butter instead of vegetable oil...it really make a difference!!!! Enjoy

This is good with vegan cream cheese!  I actually used cornmeal instead of crn flour, and needed to increase the amount by 3/4 cup extra cornmeal.  Wonderful taste!  Thanks for the recipe!  It reminds me of what a friend treated me to years ago!

Grandma told me to use warm water but i used warm milk, the cream cheese and I add mozzarella cheese flaked or shredded, made the arepas1/2 inch thick, and place in a frying pan at medium  turning  every 20 seconds. We do not have electric appliance as in the video . Very good and tasty with a good cup of coffee without the honey.

Definitely different than traditional recipes, but easy and worth the try especially if you prefer a DENSER cake.

I'm used to the arepas from following the recipe on the back of the P.A.N. bag. Just flour, water, salt. These had a nice flavor but the texture was just too dense.

Absolutely delicious! I used low fat cream cheese, and had to add p.a.n. flour to get the right consistency  (about half a cup). They came out a little dense, but soooooo good!

Haven't tried this recipe because I don't have and can't find the flour.  Also discovered that you don't need an arepas maker...can just use a heavy skillet.  I missed seeing that in the recipe.
