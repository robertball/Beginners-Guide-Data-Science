This recipe is very good and will be a go to for us! I used to make a similar recipe for marinara sauce on the stove, but never had the time to just let it go and cook longer than 30 minutes. Using the instant pot, this recipe is excellent with no changes needed--the flavors come through and is perfect!  I added a a little sugar (1 - 1.5 tsp sugar) as we tend to get heartburn from tomato sauces. After releasing the pressure and using the immersion blender, I added Gluten Free Turkey Meatballs by Olivia to the sauce and left the Instant Pot on Keep Warm while I made the pasta. The meatballs paired well with the sauce and made an excellent pasta and meatballs dinner for us! Looking forward to making another batch of this sauce to freeze. Thanks for another great Instant Pot recipe, Bren!

3.27.18  Followed this recipe to the letter, and very happy with how this turned out.  The tomato-y flavor is deep and rich, good blend of herbs, and I’ve always added red wine to my marinara, so I liked that as well.  I had to run out for an appointment right as the cooking cycle was complete, so I just let the pressure release naturally.  The sauce was a bit on the thin side for us (personal taste preference), so I just turned on the Saute function, and cooked it down for about 5 minutes.  Always on the hunt for good Instant Pot® recipes, and this is a good one!  This will go on a meatball hoagie tomorrow, and the rest will head to the freezer.  Thanks for sharing.

Nice basic marinara sauce.  Just waiting for meat, meatballs or sausage to be added.  Would make again as it made several meals.

This was my first time using the pressure cooker for marinara and it definitely speeds up the cooking time.  I have a kiddo who is allergic to oregano so we have begun making our own marinara sauce as it is impossible to use store bought. I replaced the oregano with marjoram.  But oregano really packs a punch and to get more flavor, I also added 1 lg green pepper and 2 large stalks celery that we pulsed in the food processor, then sautéed with the onion at the beginning step.

Added a little more wine, garlic and a cup of tomato sauce. Cooked those until it was reduced and rich, somewhat roasted tasting. Then I added tomatoes, just made it a little more robust.

I followed the recipe exactly except I used Roma tomatoes out of my garden. The sauce was quite thin, I ended up boiling it on the sauté setting for about 30 mins to thicken it up. Canned tomatoes won’t have this issue, but don’t taste nearly as good!

I made this according to the recipe and my family was underwhelmed.  They'd be just as happy with the store bought sauce.
