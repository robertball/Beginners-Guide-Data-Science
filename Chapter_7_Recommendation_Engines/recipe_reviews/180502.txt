This is a great recipe.  Very close to one I got when stationed in Italy.  The main differences are the sausage wasn't used and after blanching the broccoli was sauted with the spices.  The Italian lady who taught me to make it used the same pot and water for boiling the pasta and blanching the broccoli.  Just blanch the broccoli first, scoop it out and cook the pasta.  She said it didn't add anything to the pasta but saved water and using two pots.  It has been the most requested recipe by my children when they leave home.

Used Curelom's recommendation to cook the broccoli rabe in the same pot as the pasta...less dishes is always good!  Next time, I will cook the broccoli rabe for half the time shown because it all fell apart when mixed together.  Regardless - it was delicious and easy! (skipped the olives because we don't like them)

This is delicious!  I made it vegetarian by using veggie sausage, and used collards because that was all we had.  Everyone at the table had multiple helpings, my five year-old included!  I will definitely make this again.

My family, including three teen daughters, love this!  Also good with mild ital sausage and topped with Parmesan cheese. For a complete meal, I make homemade bread sticks (a snap to make with our bread machine) and a spring mix salad with red onion, raspberries and pine nuts.

This is an easy weeknight meal but a little on the ho-hum side.  I donâ€™t care for broccoli rabe so I substituted escarole.  Added some white wine and chicken broth, as well as the fresh tomatoes suggested as an option by the submitter.  Omitted the olives and, since good fresh garlic was already included, I skipped the onion salt and garlic powder as well.

Great recipe. Added some extra garlic for my taste. Next time, I would love to make this with a cream sauce or stewed tomatoes. Thanks!

The recipe was delicious.  I changed it a little because I was unable to find broccoli rabe.  I used broccolini and in retrospect it was easier for the toddler palate that I also cook for!  Broccolini is obviously much sweeter in flavor so it might have changes the essence of the dish but it was a hit at my house. I also didn't have onion salt or garlic powder so decided to use fresh (2tbsp +2 tsp of fresh onion and 4 1/8 tsp of garlic- in addition to the 2 garlic cloves it calls for.). In order to add a little sharpness I used a little pecorino at the end and chose black olives brined in salt from

Good dish.  I added 8oz of sliced mushrooms, half a chopped onion and about 1/2c of the salted pasta water, omitting the black olives and onion salt.  Makes tons!  Flavor is good the first night but the dish gets dry for leftovers.

The recipe in the Februrary/March 2017 issue of Allrecipes magazine calls for toasted bread crumbs. I made it with the bread crumbs and love it so much more.

Awesome! Subbed out hot sausage for sweet Italian chicken sausage (pkg came with only five links). Cooked  rabe first (only used one bunch as that's what I had on hand and pre-cut into 2in pieces first) then in same sense water cooked box of pasta. Used more minced garlic, just onion powder and salt. Cooked sausage first (each link cut into about  five small pieces) and then added spices along with rabe and pasta so all flavors would blend. Also added splash of white wine and left out olives. Kids loved it. Told them the pasta was shaped as a "sled" and sausages were shaped as bow ties :)

Husband noted needed a bit more flavor. I'll be more heavy handed with seasoning next time. I skipped any added salt due to olives and garlic salt. We also added in sliced roma tomato and I'll likely add another one next time and more minced garlic. Overall still tasty and not too hard to make.

Excellent! Everyone in my family had seconds. I used mild italian sausage cooked on the grill and cut into coins and cauliflower as well as leftover peas. I also was generous with the black pepper. This will definately be put into our rotation.

This dish was good but nothing great.  Very bland and lacking in flavor.     Needs garlic and a sauce of some sort .  I will make it again and add more spices to give it added zip.  The grated parmesan cheese helped.

This is a good base recipe, but it definitely needs some tweaking.  Even if making the recipe straight, it doesn't make sense to have directions to cook pasta & broccoli rabe simultaneously when one takes 1/2 as much time as other to cook.  The sausage actually took the longest to cook, so unfortunately the pasta sat too long and the orecchiette stuck together a bit.  

Next time I would get the water started,  prep the broccoli rabe, then heat up the olive oil and sautee 1/2 a chopped onion, then add the sausage.  Rather than cooking the sausage and then trying to slice up the cooked sausage (which took too long and was tedious), I would just squeeze it out of the casing and breaking up the pieces as it cooks.  That way you get smaller pieces of sausage throughout the dish.  I would add extra garlic and then eliminate the garlic powder and onion salt altogether).  Then I would do as others suggested and cook the broccoli rabe in the pasta water, strain it out, and then get the pasta going so it is the last thing done.  Reserve some cooked pasta water to help distribute the olive oil/sausage sauce if you need to.  Once the pasta is nearly cooked, toss black olives (recipe doesn't say but I drained them) and the broccoli rabe in with the sausage so it gets nicely coated, drain the pasta, return to pot, and toss in everything from the other pan.  Top with freshly grated parmesan cheese.

Awesome!!! I went light on the broccoli rabe and heavy on the sausage =) The italian ring sausage (that I can only ever find in Jersey) with provolone and parsley is great for this recipe!
