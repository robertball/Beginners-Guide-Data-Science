Let's begin by stating I followed the instructions for this recipe exactly, making one minor modification in regards to baking a cake instead of cupcakes.

 

There was no sweetness to the cake. The consistency of the cake was very... pasty? Smooth and pasty.

This is just some advice for everyone regarding baked goods in general (this recipe included). If you are making a cake, muffins, bread, etc. don't over mix it. Over mixing it causes the gluten to "tense up" thus creating a very tough and foam-like product. So if you are having this issue, ease up on your mixing, and let your batter be.

This recipe was great. It also was very quick and easy. To add fluffiness like a cupcake I added a tsp. of baking powder and a little milk to loosen the batter. I also tried them with whole wheat flour and they were a tasty treat.

This was a pretty good recipe. I didn't have any self-rising flour, so I used regular flour and for every cup I put in 
1 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt. I also put in another 1/2 tsp baking powder and some milk as suggested by another reviewer. Besides being a little eggy it was very good and cupcake-like.

I made these for my son's first birthday party and they were VERY dry. When I was mixing them it did not seem that the batter moist enough, that should have been my first clue. I will not make these again.

You cannot expect cupcakes made from scratch to be like cakebox cupcakes -- I think many reviewers didn't like these for that reason.  That being said, I did follow other suggestions and added an add'tl 1 1/2 tsp. baking powder, an add'tl 1/4 c. sugar, and substituted 1 egg for 1 cup milk.  I also added an add'tl 1 tsp. vanilla.  These were very light and fluffy and will be perfect when frosted because of the subtle sweetness.

This recipe was very easy to make but the 'cupcakes' tasted much more like muffins.  They didn't have the fluffiness or sweetness I expect in a cupcake.

I have to agree with the other reviewer, this recipe was more of a muffin rather than a cupcake.. but it was really really really good!! and just too easy. It baked perfectly and tasted really good.. I'm not fond of extra sweet things and the sugar in this recipe was just right. 

I added some crushed walnuts and cashews and substituted two tablespoons of butter with two tablespoons of peanut butter.. The result was a nutty vanilla-ey delight! 
Thanks!

I noticed that the ingredients in these cupcakes were very much like cookies.  And it made a batter rather similar to that of cookies.  And, surprise surprise,  the consistency of the cupcakes themselves was more like cookies than cupcakes.  They weren't light and fluffy like I thought cupcakes should be.  They were quite dry.  The flavour was ok, but it could have used some more sugar and vanilla I think.  A little bland.  I didn't have self rising flour (I don't think we have that in Canada), so, based on another cupcake recipe, I used 1 1/2 cups of regular flour and 1 teaspoon of baking soda.  I noticed one of the other reviewers used baking powder.  I wonder if that was a mistake on my part and that contributed to dryness/denseness?  Or they may just need a little less flour, or a little liquid (milk).

In the middle of each cupcake I 'hid' a chocolate rosebud, and iced them with some great chocolate icing.  The chocolate saved them from being an utter failure.  But I was not entirely impressed with how they turned out.  I was wondering if it was my own fault, but I see several other reviewers had similar reactions.

As is this is a three star recipe but we tweaked it to make it taste good> first we had no self rising flour so we mixed baking powder with regular flour and lessened the butter bc it is very buttery and we also added milk bc it was very sticky and needed liquid> it came out light and fluffy.

This is a pretty plain cupcake that needs a few additions. I added about 1/3 c. milk and 1 T. oil, with that they were pretty fluffy (you'll need to increase bake time to 25 minutes). Because they are not overly sweet it makes a perfect base for your own flavors or a really funky frosting.  I used "Creamy Chocolate Frosting" from this site and they balanced each other very well.

Great!  My son loves them... and I like them because they are not so completely sickly sweet that he has a tummy ache after eating them.  They also hold together really well and keep well.

This is a very poor cupcake recipe. More like a muffin type recipe. Does not have the sweetness of a cupcake. Also very dry. Kids did not enjoy.

This cupcake was really fun and easy to make!  After reading some other reviews, I did add a splash of milk for a light, fluffy cupcake.  I also used applesauce and baking soda in lieu of eggs, but that was just because I didn't have any eggs.  I paired it with brown sugar cream cheese frosting and it made a wonderful cupcake!

They were great! I baked them for a friend's birthday party and everyone loved them. The only thing that I would criticize is that they could be a little sweeter. Next time I will add more sugar. I will definetly repeat this.

I made this in an Easybake oven. I only used the electric mixer for the butter and sugar. The batter was a little too thick so I added like 1 tablespoon of half/half. Hopefully this helps!

For my son's birthday party, we had some guests with egg and tree nut allergies, so the chocolate cupcakes I had made were not going to work for them. I started making these at 9pm and only had powdered sugar, wheat flour to which I added b.powder and salt, and to replace the eggs I used 4 tbs. of my baby's organic carrot and applesauce baby food! They turned out pretty good. I was expecting to make a late night run to the store, but I was really surprised.  Next time I will probably add a little milk to make them more cake- like.  Frosted and decorated, our little friends will not feel deprived at the party, so yay!

This recipe needs a lot of changing to be good. I read what everyone was saying about it being too dry and not sweet enough so I added 3/4 cup of milk and added an extra 1/4 cup of sugar. It turned out ok but next time if there is a next time I would use one less egg. I also didnt have riasing flour so I added 1 1/2 teaspoons of backing powder and 1/2 teaspoon of salt so if anyone else needs a substitution here is is :)

This recipe made more of a Vanilla Muffin I thought. It was very quick and easy, but a little dry, and not sweet enough. No offense to the person who uploaded it! I thought it was still pretty good!

The cupcake turned out fine, it was just less sweet and more crunchy than I was looking for (even though it wasn't burnt or anything).  Made up for it by frosting it with Nutella (delicious!).

These cupcakes are dry and bland.  I made the original recipe exactly how it's recommended, with the second batch I added milk, vanilla sugar, and more vanilla, that didn't save it, but it did improve the taste.

Let me start by saying that we accidentally used normal sugar and flour, so that threw it off. They were too firm and a bit dry, but most likely because of those two mistakes. They were pretty good, and a delicious way of icing them is putting melted chocolate on top.

My cupcakes came out looking exactly like in the picture. It was so dry and grainy. I wanted to make this for my daughter's baptism party, but the self rising flour didn't work very well and the consistency was more of a cake than a cupcake

This recipe is easy to make, but it didn't turn out at all like a cupcake. It was very spongey. The batter, after mixing all ingredients, was more like a dough...The cupcakes don't taste extremely bad, but I wouldn't serve them to anyone.

Just made these and they turned out looking great. But I agree with some reviews, it needed some modifying. I recommend using some oil to keep them moist.

Right after adding the flour, it seemed like the mix was way too dry, and that is when I looked at the reviews where numerous people had stated the same.  I added some milk, but the cupcake did not end up much like a cupcake.  I also added more sugar.  The end result was the texture and somehow almost the taste of cornbread.

I added a pt of blueberries and made it as a muffin. I was really happy with the way it turned out. I added a little under 1/4 a cup of milk and 2 tsp baking powder and used regular flour instead.

They were delicious! A mixture of gooey and stiff made them perfect. Not your usual fluffy treat. We sold these at a bake sale and ran out of them before we finished selling.

This recipe is ok. A bit dry and on the biscuity/scone side... 

I cut them in half, added strawberry jam and topped with whipped cream.. 

Not sure I would make these again unless I was short on time and lacking in ingredients.

Listening to another guy's comments, I substituted 1 egg for a cup of milk, and it turned out great, although  it needed a tad more sugar... but icing would balance it out pretty nicely.

This recipe was the best! I'm 12 years old, and this cupcake recipe was so easy to follow, and it tasted great. Hanatarou, your recipe was really helpful. I'm planning on decorating them with green vanilla frosting and M&Ms for Easter.... I'm sure everyone will love them!

I don't understand why everyone has such a huge issue with this recipe, all it needs is a little bit of milk, not a lot but enough to make it a thick dropping consistency!, Its simple & results in a nice firm but moist cupcake, the type of standard cupcake that's moist & yummy but doesn't fall apart upon taking the case off! Also, be sure no to mix your ingredients too much, be sure to mix just until all ingredients are blended. Thank you to the person who shared this :] x

In all fairness to the person that posted this, it is a very good cake or cupcake when made properly.  I agree with the one review, if it came out dry and tasteless you over mixed it.  I have simular recipes that I have made for years with basically the same ingredients and they are always soft and moist.  You can also use different flavorings in this recipe to make it different.

flavor of cupcakes is just ok, a little more vanilla might help it.  The consistency however is dense and not cupcake-like at all.  When they came out of the oven, they looked like tiny muffins.  Quite a disappointment.

These cupcakes turned out terribly. Their texture was like chewing on a piece of rubber. Flavor wise, they were okay, but there was really no getting past the texture. I was extremely disappointed because I made an amazing peanut butter frosting and ended up having nothing to put it on!

Taste good, but very dry. I actually thought about tossing them. But spruced them up with a little raspberry jam filling.

Really good I loved them!! I brought them to the super bowl party and only 1 was left of course I had to eat it:) I forgot to put the egg whites in so they didn't rise all the way but I filled them to the top but they didn't overflow. They had some flavor but not enough for my sweet tooth! Hope this helps:)

I wanted a basic cupcake recipe my 12 year old could make and this one seemed to fit the bill.  I read the reviews, the batter was really thick so she added about 1/2 cup of milk.  The result was not like a fluffy cupcake but a much more dense cupcake, I agree with the reviewer who said they tasted like sugar cookies, they totally did.  Which I thought was really good.  Different, but good. They were solid, but not hard, which made them easier for my 12 year old to frost.

I used this recipe a few weeks ago for my friend and while he seemed to enjoy them I thought they tasted so plain and not sweet. They also felt like I was eating a sponge. I would not recommend this recipe AT ALL.

This was a good cupcake for having children frost but, this is not a cupcake that I would make to eat otherwise or to give to friends. This cupcake resembled sugar cookies much more than I would have hoped from a cupcake.

Actually, I had decided to make them. Curiosity got the best of me. So I followed the recipe with a few modifications listed in a few of the other reviews ( added 1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder and substituted one cup milk for one of the eggs, also added about 1/4 cup more sugar). They turned out wonderfully and the kids ate em up! I had a couple myself! Most recipes on here, and I mean alot, have modifications, and at least a few reviews should always be read beforehand, BEFORE deciding to try out the recipe:)

This cupcake was pretty heavy. I was hoping for a lighter, fluffier cupcake. I also used an orange extract in the recipe, and found that helps with the flavor to pop a little more.

Awesome cupcakes.... made a small modification, added one stick of softened butter and one cup raw cane sugar... these cupcakes couldn’t have been any better. Me and my year old had loads of fun making them.

I don't know why people are rating this so badly other than that it needs a little baking powder and milk, as another reviewer said, but if you've made a lot of breads/cakes from scratch before then you know the texture you should be trying to achieve. With that said I made this and found it to be very moist. It's almost like the store bought cake mixes but without all of the additive ingredients. I made a buttercream frosting for them, very good.

The review said couldn't eat it but I couldn't even get in out of the freaking pan!!! I buttered the pan very well and when I used cupcake liners it still didn't work!! 0 stars! I'm a experienced cook and I've made cupcakes before and they never come out with this recipe! Waste of my time!!??????

THIS RECIPE DOES NOT INCLUDE BAKING POWDER OR BAKING SODA. In order to achieve a moist, fluffy cake, the batter requires a leavening agent. The texture of this cake comes out as a cornbread consistency. Do not make this recipe WITHOUT a leavening agent or the cake will be dense and dry!
DO NOT MAKE THIS RECIPE!! IT SHOULD NOT BE A "TOP RATED RECIPE!"

I really enjoyed trying this recipe out. The cupcakes were yummy and spongy just the way I like them.I can't wait to give it another go. Advise or the ones finding it dry, add a little milk to the mixture. it worked for me!

By themselves? Not good at all.  With drizzly chocolate icing? Much better.  However, the actual cupcakes were a disappointment.

I personally thought that they were decent. They weren't the most amazing things to make, but i must admitt, they are very easy to make. I was at my grandmothers and she did not have very many ingredients, so I thought these were perfect for the cause. Although if you make them, don't make them plain, I added chocolate frosting, (home-made) which I thought made them taste much better. Overall, decent, good, and easy!

I have to say these came out perfect!  I used SmartBlend instead of butter and half n half instead of milk.  LOVED IT!

These cupcakes were okay. We split the dough in half and substituted the vanilla for strawberry and raspberry extract. They tasted very egg-y though and did not have much flavor.

These are okay, but not the best cupcake I've ever had. They taste like sugar cookies, and are a bit dry.  My favourite part was the buttercream frosting I added! I'd add some milk, because they were quite crumbly.

This is very tasty! The batter almost looks like cookie dough and it is very muffin like, as other reviews mention. We will make it again.

These cupcakes are really good! My picky kids love them!! I did add a little bit of milk and baking powder.  Also, my daughter loves chocolate, so I added 2 tbs to half of the mix.

Before making these I thoroughly read through people.s comments and most were complaining about the cupcakes coming out dry. So I made the modifications which were suggested here. I substituted one egg with a cup of milk, added 1/4 cup more sugar and a spoon of cooking oil and they came out perfectly

These turned out great! I was looking for cupcakes for Easter, and I’m glad I found this one. Some suggestions that I had was that I substituted the sour cream for 1/2 cup of milk, and added sprinkles. I also baked them for 17 minutes instead of 19, and they were perfect!

I made these yesterday, I followed the recipe to the penny and I was so disappointed. They were dry, and tasted like I had put cornmeal in them. I may try putting more flavoring and maybe some sour cream in them next time, if I decide to make them again.

These were fluffy and yummy! Rave  reviews from the family. I didn’t have self rising  flour on-hand so I looked up how to make it and it was simple. I reduced the sugar just a bit and it was a perfect balance with the homemade frosting I made.

My batter was very dry so I added an extra egg. By doing so, I had to stir more which resulted in a heavier cupcake consistency.  Taste was great though.  I chose to try this recipe because some reviews stated it wasn't sweet enough.  I made it for the birthday of a diabetic relative and didn't want store bought or sickly sweet.   I'd try it again with the extra egg added when it should have been added. BTW I used large eggs.

If you are looking for light, airy, and moist cupcakes like I was, this is probably NOT the recipe for you. They were very dense and dry. I’m was very disappointed with this recipe. The only reason why I put 2 stars was because the flavor was delicious. If the cupcakes’ texture was better, this would be a fantastic recipe. I probably won’t use this recipe again. Bummer.

It was a sugar cookie. Everyone in my family agreed it tasted like a sugar cookie. But it was a really good sugar cookie. If I was reviewing sugar cookies it would be a five but this is supposed to be a cupcake.

Cup cakes turned out really well. Had to add little milk ( about 2Tbsp ) just to adjust the consistency of the batter which was a bit too sticky and thick.

The texture was very similar to cornbread.. I doubled the vanilla, added a ton of sprinkles for a pretty center,  and it was still a little bland.

I followed the recipe (which only had 5 ingredients), and this was a delicious cupcake that was super simple.  Even the batter seemed so different from a boxed cake mix.  When I took the first bite of the cake out of the oven, it tasted like a sugar cookie.  So flavorful, and you can really taste the butter.   In the future, I might  reduce the butter.

I am an absolute beginner baker but managed to make these! I HAVE NOT TRIED THESE, because they're for a family friend's birthday, but they LOOK amazing! Again, I'm rating this on appearance right now. Hopefully I can make more and try them later on! ? (Though the batter tasted very good!)

I made this but changed the tin aspect. I made a cake instead of cupcakes. It came out extremely dense with my family asking about the egg to flour ratio.

When I first made these I thought there were too little ingredients. So, when I made them, I added a little bit less then 1 tsp of baking powder and 1/2 tsp of salt to the flour whisking it together in a seperate bowl and then adding it to the wet ingredients.  It turned out delicious! Also, if the cupcake batter seems a bit thick just add milk until the the batter is just right!

Really easy to make and delicious.. They are my first cupcakes that I've ever made from scratch so I have to compare them to box batter, the difference I've noticed is that this recipe is a little thicker than what I'm used to seeing but other than that I must say that they are AMAZING and everyone loves them.
They are full figured and fluffy, so good.
Thank you for a great recipe!

Not many people (me included) use self-rising flour on a regular basis (if at all).  The recipe should bring this to the baker's attention as it was very easy to miss the first time I made this recipe.  It was AWFUL!!  The cupcake was dense and the flavor was off-putting.  I am definitely NOT going to make this recipe again.

This recipe tastes fine but I think it is better for muffins.  It doesn't really have the sweetness or fluffiness of cupcakes.  It is not hard to make, however, if you want something sweeter this is not it.

Came out great. A little buttery for my taste. I added an extra 1/2 tsp of vanilla for some flavor.  And I added an 1/8 cup of milk or so to make them moist  (I do this with all baked goods). This recipe yielded 9 cupcakes. Since I didn't have self rising flour, I added 1.5 tsp of baking powder and estimated 3/8 tsp of salt.

This recipe did not work out at all. The batter curtled before I could bake it. I followed the recipe exactly.

I will not be making this again. It was very tough and I had followed all the directions and exact measurements. It tasted like a really cheap store bought cupcake and was hard like a stiff rubber. I'm opened to suggestions for a new vanilla cupcake recipe.

This cupcake was absolutely amazing. I made this for my family more than 3 times and it was perfect every time. I added gummy bears and chocolate chips to it which really added a kid to it . My brother loved it! Thank you for this amazing recipe!

I couldn't find self rising flour, so I used all purpose flour instead The cupcakes turned out dense and dry. Don't use all purpose flour for this cupcake.

The flavor was good, but because there was no liquid element, such as milk, added to the batter, it was a little dry. I would say if you are going to make these add a little bit of milk.

It was a little pasty but for the most part it was okay i did change it up a bit and added more vanilla,instead of 1 teaspoon i added about 3 tablespoons and it was sweet like a cupcake just not as fluffy as i would like.

I learned that 20 minutes is not enough..When I opened my oven, it was not cooked. So I put an extra 5 minutes and THEN it was ready. The cupcakes were delicious and I would make it again possibly soon. The cupcakes deserve to be made again!

This is an amazing recipe. Probably the tastiest dough I have ever tried. Traditional store bought cupcakes are too sweet for me, and these are perfect in sweetness, soft and just wonderful overall . We could not stop eating them. I have done them twice and now came back for this recipe again.

my first time making something from scratch/homemade. didn't turn out the way I hoped. next time I will try less butter and longer cooking time. I think the recipe in itself is fine. I just never tried baking like my great-great granddaddy until now. I'm going to keep trying to get this right. Will update as I progress.

This is the second time I have made these, and they turned out fine. But the recipe doesn't mention to use baking powder if you don't have self rising flour. So they did not come out picture perfect, but they were still great!

I added 1/4 cup milk, and baking soda, because the first time I made them, they was a little dry. I made them 20 minutes ago and they taste delicious! I'm also using frosting to decorate them for Halloween! I will definitely make them again!

When I first made these cupcakes I was doubtful because the batter was watery but after I put them in the oven and let them cook they came out very well. They were springy and moist and looked just like the display picture. So if your batter is watery don't doubt yourself and alter the recipe they should come out just fine.

This is a really yummy cupcake. I used regular flour and added 2.5 teaspoons baking powder. Also, added an extra teaspoon vanilla. Made it in our new sunbeam cupcake maker. Taste, texture perfect.

I made these vanilla cupcakes tonight, they are very straightforward to make, I did use vanilla paste instead of extract and I added 2 tablespoons of milk as it was quite a thick mixture, once made I divided them into cupcake holders and sprinkledthem with chocolate chips before baking for 20 minutes they are fabulous. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I followed the recipe and tried it out after cooking it for twenty minutes and the cupcake itself doesn't have much taste but has a more soft buttery flavor and I tried out lemon poppy cupcake by adding a hint of lemon extract and a dash of poppy seeds and found that combination to be more appealing

the picture i added is the russel hobbs tray of cupcakes. so u can understand how they turned out after ny changes. using the app i halved the recipe to 6 cupcakes and replaced 1/2 an egg with 1/4 cup of milk. also added a handful of dessicated coconut. i used plain flour so also had to add baking powder and bicarb of soda. cakes rose  very well with crispy golden tops while soft and fluffy inside. like others said they are a tad bit dry but still a good guideline for cupcakes. i would add a splash of milk to the original recipe and very important to not overmix when adding the flour!! fold with a metal spoon just till they are blended then spoon into the cups.

This recipe was okay, baked it this afternoon, i did add in a few ingredients though. Before I bake, I saw some reviewers stated that it's not sweet enough so I added 20 grams of sugar more, I also add a tablespoon of baking powder so that it will raise higher and i think that 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract is not enough because my cupcakes did not really have the taste of vanilla. I use a fork to mix instead of mixer but the result still ended fine. I also added chocolate chips! yummy!

I dropped one on the floor and it split in half! They came out like cornbread. They were extremely dry and completely tasteless. I felt like I was eating a sponge.

Very easy, might be one of the easiest,simplest from scratch recipes i have ever seen. However when i was mixing the batter it was so dry my mixer could barely mix. I ended up adding water so i could mix it and the texture turned out weird. Will try again but will need to change some things.

This recipe didn't really have any taste and tasted almost like bread.  To me, they did not taste like vanilla cupcakes.   I baked the cupcakes an extra 10 minutes and they didn't turn golden brown. My husband and I had to make another batch. We added some salt, baking powder and a little milk.  When baking these cupcakes, definitely add baking powder, salt and milk. If you want, add more vanilla extract as well. Not the best recipe for vanilla cupcakes.

i tried the recipe today and its the best ever! I adjusted the recipe to to 24 serving and to follow to a metric measurement. I did add about 5 spoons of yogurt to the mix.  My  4 kids (teenagers) loved the cupcakes. I am so baking this again

They looked like corn bread muffins and were very dry and too fluffy. Also, they were not sweet enough and I had to bake them for 10 min. longer than the recipe stated.

I decided to add in a teaspoon of baking powder and 1/2 cup of milk to the mix. However, it still didn't rise as much as I wanted it to but it was moist and tasted pretty good.

I was looking for a vanilla cupcake recipe after my dad challenged me by saying that I couldn't make cupcakes if I tried. I was looking to impress him (obviously) so I looked for one that had great reviews. But after all, he was trying to cut down on his cholesterol, and there is WAY too much butter in this recipe. When I added the icing after they were done it was a lot better, but I still think that I will look for another cupcake recipe to prove him wrong about my baking skills.

I made them for my little brother and I was shocked. He is only 3 and he spat them out after taking a bite. I took a bite, and they were rock hard, I did exactly what you wrote and I got very upset. If i could, I would give it zero stars.

Made these today with some lemon buttercream icing to the letter, cupcakes turned out more like muffins with how dense they are.  Not exactly the cupcake lightness I was expecting, and a dry batter should have been my first clue as well.  Won't use this again.

These were great! They were simple to make and sweet but not too sweet, over all a great recipe for quick and easy sweet. I did however add a tsp. of baking powder for fluffiness and they were great!

Having made several cakes from scratch, I modified this recipe to fit my needs. Added in a touch of oil when it was too dry, some cocoa powder and Hershey's chocolate sauce to get the brownie taste, and popped them in the oven for brownie-cakes for my daughter's birthday. If it's too dry, add liquid, guys. Cooking is not an exact science, but it's a common sense one. Enjoy your treats and your days, I hope, and be blessed! :)

Honestly, these cupcakes would make better dinner rolls. They were definitely fluffy and airy; but they had too much of a butter flavor and they lost their sweetness/vanilla taste. They were definitely easy; but I wouldn't make them again.

Wow, I honestly was amazed with the turnout of my cupcakes. They were delicious! Everyone loves them and I have made this recipe for the 4th time this past 2 months! I recommend this to anyone who wants an awesome tasting cupcake! Just don't overbeat your batter. I actually added my own touch to this and filled my cupcakes with some Nutella. Yummmmm!!!!

I made this for my cousins 5th birthday. I decorated them with rainbows (as you might have seen in the picture previews). They were such a hit that my family was asking me if it was from the box! They tasted really good and I recommend them for anyone. (:

Absolutely amazing cupcake, very moist and delicious! Hands down the best cupcake I have ever had and made. I put two tsp of vanilla instead of just one, and the batter it very loose almost like water but it turned out amazing, plus I put a white chocolate and butterscotch ganache on top and made a white chocolate Lilly on top!

These Cupcakes are great! They really taste and look like a vanilla cupcake. The only thing I had a problem with was that alot of the ones i made came out with holes in them. Other than that they were good!

I kind of filled the batter half way and it took longer to bake. The top is not soft but overall the cupcakes are delicious!

Very simple and easy, great recipe for kids! I tripled the recipe and added instant pudding mix and 2 TBSPs of water and it turned out perfect, moist and delish :)

This recipe was really good, just a little bit dry. Next time I will try what someone else suggested and try to mix my batter a little bit less, hopefully that will work. Other than that this recipe is great! It's really good for Halloween partys if you add food coloring and then after they are cooled a little bit of Nutella on top and then crushed chocolate cookies (Oreos...) and then you can add sprinkles or edible beads and write something like "R.I.P" or "BOO".

I made these for the fist time with my 3 year old. We really enjoyed them. I didn't find them dry at all, and the batter wasn't thick either. So, I'm not sure why other's were having problems with thickness and dryness. Ours were wonderful! Will be making them again! Thank you for the recipe!

LOVED it! I also used Whole wheat flour, 1 tsp. of baking powder and some heavy cream to make them more fluffy. I didn't have super fine sugar so I used regular white sugar. They are SUPER sweet and can't wait to frost them! Maybe even filling the middle with some buttercream and topping them off with chocolate butterflies!

Tasted good, but the texture was more of a muffin. It was really dense.

The batter was really thick but somehow my cupcakes came out quite fluffy in the middle.  The tops were a bit stiff, but they were still delicious.    I made these for my son's birthday party, so I won't know the true verdict until a bunch of 10-12 year olds rate it for me.  I don't have self rising flour, so I had to use All Purpose and add 1 tsp of baking powder and a pinch of salt.  I also added a bit of milk.
