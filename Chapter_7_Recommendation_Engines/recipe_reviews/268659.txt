Real Cuban sandwiches DO NOT include mayo, Dijon mustard, or garlic powder. Lightly rub some butter on top of the bread while heating. Otherwise, ingredients are correct. A good ham to use would be Boar's Head Sweet Slice (available at Publix). Pork should not have too much seasoning. NO LETTUCE, TOMATO, ONIONS, etc. 
Instead of cutting the bread into slices and making individual little sandwiches, Slice the baguette down the middle as for a regular sandwich. Assemble all the ingredients on the bottom slice, yellow mustard goes on the inside of the top slice. Cover the ingredients with the top of the baguette and put the whole thing on a sandwich press or weigh down as in the original recipe. When done, cut the sandwich into half inch slices. That way you still end up with individual slices, nicer presentation, and everyone gets a bit of the crusty top.

Left out the mayo and pressed in my panini maker. Could be 5 stars if made as stated.
