This is pretty good, but there is a similar recipe on this site called "Apple Sheet Cake" by Barbara (not sure why it is called cake, it's nothing like a cake and very much like apple pie!) that is a little bit better. The dough is simpler and the filling is thickened. Either recipe is definitely worth a try though!

This is a really good recipe.  I personally made them in a jellyroll pan using all the crust on the bottom and adding a crumb topping instead.  I added 1/3c. flour so the filling wasn't too runny and used 2/3 brown sugar and 1/3 white in the filling.  It received rave reviews at both my work and my husband's work.  Thanx!

The crust is wonderful, it should be doubled though, and make sure your apples are thickened, you really don't want any juices.  Also a nice plain drizzled icing over top works well.

Terrific recipe! I doubled the crust, and will probably use unsalted butter instead of shortening next time.

This is great for apple pie lover's!  I tossed in 1/4 cup flour with apples to thicken juices and it was perfect!  IF you have any leftover you can put cut bars in the fridge and take out as needed. Add spices to your taste! Good crust, too!

These are super delicious, but I was under the impression that this would be easier than making an actual pie and it wasn't.  I still had to make the dough and roll it out.  I imagine it wouldn't be too difficult to substitute a storebought pie crust, though, if one wanted something slightly simpler.

My husband has taken this to work several times and it's gone before lunch.  I only make half of the icing, so that it's not quite as sweet.  This is a great way to have apple pie for a crowd.

They were pretty good, though it didn't turn out to be apple "bars". It was more of a crisp. The only way it would stay in bar form was if it was in a really cold fridge for a couple hours.

It tastes great, only crumbs were left after I brought it into work.  My only complaint was having a difficult time with the crust.  It didn't want to roll out nice, very sticky.  When I added flour then it didn't want to stick together.  I also added nutmeg to apple mixture. YUMMY!

I halved the recipe and baked in a 9x9" pan.  I used three large Cameo apples.  I added a little flour with the apples as per other reviews and added just a touch of nutmeg.  I wasn't completely sold on the end result but DH thought it was great.  I'm thinking it would be better with sour apples.  It really does need to cool in order to be bars.  If you cut it hot, it is apple pie.

I have made this recipe 5 or 6 times in the past 3 months - absolutely love it!  I made it yesterday for Thanksgiving (rather than pie) and had several compliments.  I've had a few people at work ask for the recipe too!  I especially love the crust!  Will keep with my "favorites"!

These were absolutely delicious.  I made only a single recipe for the crust, and had plenty.  I did add the extra flour to the filling, and was glad I did.  Also, we happened to use some dehydrated apple slices we had from our food storage, this was a great use for them.  yumm!

Delicious as is.  I've used all butter, 1/2 butter and 1/2 butter/shortening as well as all shortening.  Butter wins.  Make the dough ahead and refrigerate,  It's very delicate, but easy to patch.  Use several varieties of apples for best flavor.  I also want to make this and add fresh cranberries for cran-apple slices.

I did not do any of the egg ingredients (I am allergic) and it turned out very good still! I also did not have my 13x9 handy, so so doubles the dough recipe and put it on a jelly roll pan and just spread with my fingers. I sprinkled with granulated sugar then brown sugar then cinnamon then dotted with remain dough. Turned out still very beautiful and delicious!

The minute I rolled out the dough for this recipe, I knew this was going to be good. I did modify the filling by adding more apples, sugar and cinnamon, just because I feel it can ever be too much. This dish was a hit and practically devoured in one sitting. Next time, I’m going to try this with a cherry filling. This was super easy and delicious.

I like my apple pie filling a bit more spiced, so I used just a smidgen more cinnamon and nutmeg.  I didn't measure, just a little more.  Although the recipe didn't specifically say so, I did join the bottom and top crusts along the sides and at both ends.  Oddly enough, my mom used to buy these at a bakery in our area; they were a regular item.  This was decades ago.  The bakery chain is still around, but no one there knew what I was talking about when I asked if they still made them.  It's a pie slice.  How strange could that be?  Thanks for bringing back a great treat.

This was delish!  Substituted butter for shortening.  Want to try the recipe using cherries.
