This was excellent. The custard set very well. I didn't have butter milk so I just added a little extra coconut milk and regular milk. I like almond flavouring, so I used the full amount, but I found it overpowered the coconut flavour. Tasted like a great almond custard.

The flavor was very good, but it was to watery. If I make it again I'm going to try it without the cup of water.

You could even skip the extracts, except vanilla, and get a great custard!!

This was terribly disappointing. Perhaps I didn't beat the mixture long enough for the eggs to work (being afraid of the "little bubbles" at the surface) but after an hour and a half in the oven, this still was not cooked.

Followed the recipe exactly. The custard DID NOT SET UP! It became a watery mess, even after i kept cooking it. I will not be trying this again.
