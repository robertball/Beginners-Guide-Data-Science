This is the most unusual salad I have ever had.  My whole family loved it.

I really liked it, but the rest of my family didn't care for it as much.  Their definitely not picky eaters by any means, but I think I might use a little less of the oil and vinegar mixture next time.  After eating it, I'm thinking rosemary might be another good herb to try with it.  I will make it again.

I made the following changes, firstly I don't like or have instant rice. I made regular long grain white Jasmine rice . I cooked it with chicken broth instead of water. I think this adds nice depth of flavor. Otherwise I left other ingredients as listed. Very nice change.

Sorry, but I thought this was completely boring and tasteless.  There's really nothing to give this much flavor.  I started adding more salt & pepper, and some cayenne and some garlic powder, just to add *something* to it so I wouldn't have to waste it.

I really don't know how I feel about this salad.  I'm new to fresh tarragon after enjoying it in chicken salad.  I had some leftover from Christmas and looked for recipes to use it up.  I do enjoy rice salad and even though this sounded like a weird combination I thought I'd try it.  I used short grain brown rice and cooked it in broth.  I had to used dry chives.  I did not mix in the chopped egg but rather kept them separate to sprinkle on top.  I may try this again when I have fresh chives and perhaps use plain rice (not cooked in broth).

This salad was definitely different - I'll give it that. Neither my husband nor I cared for it. Fortunately, it doesn't make much.

This was fairly good except I didn’t cook the rice long enough…opps. Felt it might be a little better warmed up a tad. I served this with Sesame Sirloin Steak from this site.
