Something is missing.  Maybe it needs more spices or a different veggie (spinach? yum).  What my family and I loved about it is that it's like a lighter version of lasagna. It's tasty and it's easy to make.  Personally, I think it's more of an entr√©e than a side dish, but I'm a vegetarian, so my standards may be a little different.

I agree that the recipe needs some oomph.  I make a similar dish with black beans and diced tomatoes with green chilis.  Corn would be a nice addition.  If the intent is Italian, maybe a pinch of crushed red pepper and some olives?

This is a great and VERY EASY dish! Like the other reviews said, I could see it needed something more. So I added spinach to the layers, and plenty of basil and oregano. My family was thrilled with the result! It's a wonderful gluten-free alternative to lasagna.
