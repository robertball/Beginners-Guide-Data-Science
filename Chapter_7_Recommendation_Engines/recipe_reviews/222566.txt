Very yummy and satisfying.  Great for an easy lunch or dinner.  Throw it on a bed of greens and it goes well with the salty feta and olives.

Made it to the exact recipe, and the whole family enjoyed all the flavors this meal had to offer. Definitely keeping this one. Thanks for the awesome recipe. I will however make these into individual omelets from now on.

Really delicious meal. I spent 1h for cooking. And I think that there should be a quarter of cup of feta; half of cup it's too much. Definitely I will cook it again!

A good basic recipe, added lots more of all stated ingredients, plus as another reviewer suggested, thyme, oregano, basil, onion, and about a tablespoon of butter. Next time I'll add some white wine to the sauce.  With my additions, there's enough left for dinner tomorrow night, which will equal 4 servings as the main course. I'm looking forward to seeing, as one reviewer said, whether it's better the second night!

I made it with yellow peppers and threw in some half and half instead of milk not sure how much. It was amazing.

Really good flavor as is, but I'll try adding a few chopped kalamata olives next time.
