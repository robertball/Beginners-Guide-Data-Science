What a delight this recipe was, though I did cheat and had our butcher butterfly the meat.  Added minced onions to the rub mixture and let it sit in the fridge for 2 days to dry-age.  NOTE: It's important to the final dish to let the roast "rest" the appropriate amount of time after you pull it so the juices have a chance to absorb back into the meat.  Glad I went ahead and made the vinegar sauce as it gave the roast that little something extra!  Served with Amatriciana, also from AR, as the "primo or first course" of our dinner party.  Rave reviews all around!  Thank you Chef John.

I am a chef John fan. Have made several of his recipes and have never been disappointed. The cooking instructions were perfect. I omitted some ingredients (I don't have fennel seed) and added some and I think it was fabulous. I had made chef Johns butternut squash soup earlier in the day (YUM) and had leftover fresh sage. I used olive oil, seasoned panko (just a dusting), Rosemary, garlic powder, fresh sage, prosciutto, and Parmesan reggiano for the filling. Rolled it up and lightly coated the top with the same and put strips of prosciutto on top. I think it was one of the best dishes I ever made.

The flavors of this dish are amazing. I followed most of the recipe as written, including the making the vinegar sauce.  I'm a new cook so I couldn't imagine what that sauce would add to the taste.  I almost left it out but was pleasantly surprised.  We didn't have ciabatta rolls or pancetta so I used pretzel rolls and bacon.  I'll make this again.

I loved this recipe and will make it again.  I was a little unsure of  butterflying as I had never done that to a roast before.  I started cutting and it opened like a book!  I thought i would fall apart but it held its integrity and sliced beautifully.

Amazing!!! Just made this for Christmas dinner for my in laws. I looked like a cooking super star! Everyone was raving about how tender and tasty the pork was even though they never heard of porchetta before.  I purchased a 6 pound pork roast and had the butcher butterfly the meat for me. The seasoning and flavors were perfect even though I forgot the orange zest. I did make a thin pan sauce from the drippings & served the pork with sautéed apples (also, from AR), twice baked potato casserole (also, from AR), steamed broccoli & say to green beans. A must make again, thank you very much chef John.

I always follow the recipe to the letter the first time, and this recipe doesn’t need any tweaking . I was so proud of myself! The video was very helpful in teaching technique. I loved it!

I made this for Christmas Eve last year and it was a huge hit. My sister, who is a chef said it was amazing, and i totally agree. I had the butcher fillet the meat for me. It was so elegant looking and so delicious. I highly recommend this.

This was very good.  I made no changes.  Next time though I will get my shoulder blade roast from a higher end store since the one I got from Walmart was almost cut in half.  It wasn't obvious until I took the netting off.  I made it work and it tasted amazing!

Good, but not great, and yet, I'm curious enough that I'll probably try it again. I used a lovely pork shoulder from a good butcher; probably should have roasted it fat-side-up. I was hoping to attain that delicious simplicity that is a signature of Italian dishes, but found the seasoning too mild.

This was very good. I think I got the wrong cut, and it was a little too fatty, but otherwise it was very tasty. I cut down on some of the spices a little, since my family is not too big on some of them. Thanks!

The blade roast was a great cut for this recipe. I didn't use the orange zest but did use most of the spices.  Very easy to cut, roll & tie.  I oven-roasted it in a cast iron skillet.  The porchetta was super tender but not overly juicy.  Didn't make the sauce and just ate the porchetta as is.

My husband and I hosted a get-together with 20 Allrecipeeps this past weekend, and we made our first Porchetta! We did take this recipe one step further and purchased a slab of pork belly from the butcher counter of our farmers market. We layed the pork belly flat, seasoned it well and then placed the butterflied boneless pork shoulder on top and seasoned that before rolling and tying. We did not make the vinegar sauce, and we really just eyeballed the seasonings (sticking to the seasonings in this recipe). My husband is from Italy, not far from Ariccia, famous for "Porchetta di Ariccia". With the addition of the pork belly wrapped around, this is pretty darn close to the ones you find near Rome. It was a hit at our party, and we will definitely be making this again.

This was amazing! I followed the recipe but forgot the fennel seeds... Which I'm sure would have been perfect. I will be making this again and again!!

I think the quality of the pork matters greatly for this dish.  I purchased a "boneless" pork shoulder roast but it turned out to have an odd bone (probably shoulder blade) that made having a nice long piece of meat to roll up difficult.  It worked out OK and the stuffing stayed in long enough to truss the works with 5 pieces of string.  It cooked well and was just as advertised by Chef John: not soaking in meat juices but still moist.  I'll try again with a better cut of meat and hopefully will award the result with the full five stars it deserves!

I made this roast for a wine dinner we hos5 every year. OMG is all I can say. Everyone loved it . So tender and juicy. I followed the recipe but did have to tweet times as I made 
a 6 1/2 lb. roast. I had the butcher butterfly for me (he called it a shoulder boneless rump)and added all the fresh herbs, oil etc. and dit it the day before so it could air dry in the refridge over night.  So I cooked for 45 minutes at 450. And then cooked for about 2 hours more. Then let it rest for 15-20 minutes.  Delicious!  Along wit his the vegetable sides I also made focaccia bread for the first time. Wonderful. Now my family has had a taste they are requesting I make it for the next family holiday dinner. Also not a fan off the fennel so left it out!

Liked this use of pork shoulder, which made a fancier meal from an inexpensive cut of meat. I made it exactly as described, except I omitted the anchovy fillet from the sauce. It smelled wonderful, and I really enjoyed the flavor with this combination of spices, but some others at my table thought there was too much orange zest. My roast looked exactly like Chef John’s picture, but it was not super moist and tender, so just ok in that regard.

I added the traditional layer of pork belly and the crisp, crackling bite to get into the delicious center was amazing.  Otherwise, I followed Chef John's recipe exactly.  Total success, best Christmas feast ever

I thought that this was just ok. I think that I just didn't like this cut of pork. It was just too fatty for me. If I make again I would maybe try a pork tenderloin instead. If you watch the video he states to be generous with the seasonings and you really need too use a lot of it for a good taste.
