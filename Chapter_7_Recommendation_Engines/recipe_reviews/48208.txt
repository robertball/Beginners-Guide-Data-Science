Best burgers I have ever made!  I substituted the oats with Italian bread crumbs and cut the ketchup in 1/2 and added Worcestershire sauce.  Fantastic!

This recipe turned out just all right for me.  I followed the directions exactly but  I found the texture to be a little too meatloaf-y, as another reviewer mentioned.  I think that was probably the oats.  The flavor was great....I just didn't care much for the meatloaf-like  texture.  I will make this again but I think next time I will leave out the oats to see if that makes a more firm, burger-like texture.

This is almost an exact duplicate of a recipe I have been making for years (I add Worcestershire and omit the onion flakes).  For those of you who had trouble keeping the burgers together, try whirring the oatmeal in the food processor/mini-chopper for a few seconds to make them more like flour.  The benefit of oatmeal is that it assumes the taste of the meat, rather than adding its own flavor.

I thought these were great.  I used finely chopped onion rather than dried.  They were moist and I didn't have any trouble with them falling apart.  The onion soup mix gives a little kick and they taste great.

This is trully the best barbequed burger I have ever tried. My family and friends love it. The only thing I did differently was substitute the cooking oats for Italian bread crums. It was jucy and it did not break appart while grilling it. I really recomend it to everyone.

I needed a quick and easy ground beef recipe tonight so I mixed up these burgers but decided at the last minute to bake the mixture in the oven as a meat loaf.  I added about 6 drops of liquid smoke to the meat mixture and it was fabulous!  It took 40 minutes to bake at 400 degrees.  I will definitely make this again.

I was so pleasantly surprised by this recipe! This was delicious and the burgers held together very well. The flavors and spices were well balanced. I used 93% lean ground beef. My husband and son both liked these as well. Thanks so much, I highly recommend this recipe and I don't care for many burger "recipes" like this. Thanks again! Yum!

Very VERY good!  I loved how they stayed together on my grill.  The kids loved them.  The only thing I did differently was used Italian style bread crumbs instead of the oats (because I didn't have any oats!).  Will DEFINATELY fix again!!

My husband and I didn't care for these at all. The oats were not something you'd want in a burger, and the French onion mix just made them salty. Not somethng I'll make again.

These were fair. I had trouble grilling the burgers because they were so mushy and were falling apart. I won't make this recipe again unless I convert it to a meatloaf.

We made these when we grilled out on Memorial Day.  Thought they were pretty good!  They didn't have the "oomph" of flavor that I thought they would, but my husband and I both liked them just the same.  Even our picky 3-yr-old asked for more!  Next time I will try it with the seasoned bread crumbs and see if that makes a difference.  We had no problems with them breaking apart on the grill.

I joined this site just so I could give this a five star. Seeing some of the other comments, I decided to whiz the oatmeal in the food processor before adding it, and that worked out well. I grilled the burgers outside, and since my grill is small, I brought them inside when I was done and added them to a pan of hot beef broth to keep them warm until I had enough for our family to scarf down. I used my homemade bun recipe and these were so dang good I thought I was in heaven. Thanks!

This was part of a meal my mother made when I was a kid, and we were poor, probably on the same days we had mustard and sugar on a slice of bread for lunch. I like it, and will make it 1 or 2 times in the winter with mashed taterts. But I sure wouldn't call them Bar B Qued Burgers.

For Homer: Merriam-Webster's definition of "barbeque" - to roast or broil on a rack or revolving spit over or before a source of heat (as hot coals). BBQ sauce does not make something "barbequed." And yes...this is meatloaf.

I had no complaints from anyone at my table after trying these.  They were great.  Although they have alot of traditional meatloaf ingredients, they do not taste like meatloaf at all after grilling. To simplify, it may have feathers, webbed feet and a bill, but if it dosen't quack, it's not a duck.

To keep from falling apart, try cutting back on adding anything liquid...I cut the ketchup in half and they were great. Also added a little more oates.

Very good recipe - I like to add 1/4 c. Worcestershire Sauce and sometimes I use bread crumbs instead of oatmeal - very good juicy burgers :)

Only giving it a four because they were good, but not amazing. They were moist and had good flavor. I enjoyed them, but I reserve the 5's for the few dishes I choose to make more than once.

my family didn't care for the meatloaf consistency in these burgers.  Flavoring was fine otherwise.  Just too much like meatloaf.

I would name this "Grilled"....  It has no BBQ Sauce!  I am browsing recipes for a burger patty with bbq sauce.  I agree with the othereviews, This is Meatloaf.  posted from deep in the Heart of Dixie.

This recipe was good for a change in flavor.  I left mine on the grill a little longer because I cook with indirect heat on a Holland grill.  About 12 min. on each side.  I didn't have any problems with the burgers falling apart while cooking.

My husband and I thought that the flavor of these burgers was OK, but disliked the texture.  They were like meatloaf on a bun.  The burgers may have been good served with a side of potatoes or rice (as a meatloaf), but not as a traditional cookout burger.  I feel guilty throwing out the leftovers, but I know they won't be eaten.  We will stick to 'non-filler' burgers for our grill.

Taste was great but my burgers fell apart around the ends.  I followed the recipe to a 't'.  Anyone else find this?  I did use lean ground beef: would that make a difference?

It tasted really good. My only complaint is that I, too, had problems with the meat falling apart on the grill. I was thinking that if I used this as a meatloaf recipe, I might learn to love meatloaf.

I thought this was a good change from our usual burger.  The taste is very good.  However, my patties fell apart too.  I also followed the recipe to a "t", and I didn't use real lean hamburger (I think 80%).

They have a nice taste and are a great change from the usual burgers.

Excellent!  I always use the leanest ground beef I can buy and this recipe makes the burgers so moist and flavorful.  I cooked them on my George Foreman Grill.  Thanks for a great recipe...I will always use this when making burgers.

These burgers are great!
I cooked them in a deep skillet on the stovetop, and had no problem with them falling apart.
They are good even without the buns.
I have used 85% lean ground beef, and 90% lean ground sirloin.  Both were very good. I will definitely make them again. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

My husband has made these several times now...and everytime it has turned out to be really good. My husband is a simple kind a guy and does not like having to use to many ingredients to make a dish, therefore this was an awesome recipe for him to make. This is a family hit. Even the dogs liked it! :)) Thank You

Being a novice cook, I go 'by the book'.  'By the book' these burgers are fantastic!  I highly recommend this recipe and I can't wait to eat the leftovers.

This is the only way to eat hamburgers!  It makes them absolutely delicious.  Kind of light and fluffy with an awesome taste.
