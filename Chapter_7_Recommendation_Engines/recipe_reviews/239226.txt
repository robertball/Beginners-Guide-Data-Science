It's sooooo nice to see a chicken casserole that doesn't include a can of creamed soup, and the texture on this is perfectly creamy.  I did cook my chicken breast whole and then cubed.  This was just a little heavy on the O.J. for our personal taste, but that citrus flavor is an important part of what makes this special.  I  drizzled just a little bit of melted butter on the corn flakes but, otherwise, followed the recipe.  And for anybody who buys rotisserie chicken at the store, keep this recipe in mind. There are so many layers of flavor you're gonna' be surprised, and surprised in a good way.   Donna Henderson Hopgood thanks for sharing your recipe, it's a winner!

It's pretty good. I made a few changes just because I had some fresh herbs brought to me so I added fresh oregano and omitted the dill. Next time I'll leave off the cornflakes and either top with phyllo dough or biscuits. I think the cornflakes combined with the oj made it a tad too sweet.

The whole recipe came out good. I didn't like the cornflakes mixture on top.

Grabbed heavy cream and had it poured in before I realized my mistake. Casserole was still delishous. Will make with buttermilk as called for next time!
