Everybody loved it!(Even my husband, who runs for the hills when I try something new!) First time for a dish like this- I used store bought pie crusts for ease, baking the bottom crust first. I only used a half of a small head of cabbage- only wrong move- should have used it all- it bakes down! And I added about a cup of shredded medium cheddar under the processed cheese slices.  Every bite was devoured! Will definitely make this again!

I made this several times.  It serves at least four.  It is a very good copy of Runza's taste.  I also have made it using bagged coleslaw mix (pre-shredded cabbage) using one 14 oz bag per recipe instead of the cabbage--handy if you want to spend less time or don't have a food processor.  I have also used this recipe to make individual Runzas and they turned out great.  For individual Runzas I doubled the filling recipe and tripled the dough recipe to make approx. 18 Runzas.  I baked the individual Runzas on parchment paper on a cookie sheet for 15-17 min.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was delicious! I added bell pepper to help bulk it up because I didn't have quite a full pound of hamburger. I also used a 9 inch pie plate instead of an 8x8 which worked really well. My husband and two year old loved it! Will definately make this one again!

The flavor was just not there for us. I don't know, maybe my taste buds were off that day. Also, it is way more than 2 servings. One pound of hamburger, a whole head of cabbage and other ingredients generously fills an 8x8 dish. It easily could have been at least 4 servings.  I would like to try this again and play around with the seasonings.

Love the recipe and ease to make. I just omit the cabbage. Plenty of onion, carrot shreds. Mine turn out similiar to sloppy joes but that's my preference. Some cheese and just a touch of BBQ sauce makes them extra special for me.

I can't give a 5-star rating because I adapted the filling a little, but I must say that the dough is PERFECT!!! Even better than the crescent rolls that are usually part of this recipe!

A family favorite. I've tried a variety of cheeses but processed swiss slices are the best. Can't think of much else to use them for but they are great in this! We get 6 good size portions from this recipe.
