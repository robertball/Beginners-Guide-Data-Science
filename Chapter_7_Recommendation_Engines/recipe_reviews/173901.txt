Made this stew tonight and it was a hit! Full of flavour and the chicken just fell off the bone. Very tasty!! I will definitely make this one again.

Zesty, aromatic, surprising taste blend! I diced potatoes and onions rather than use the packaged mix, and removed skin on drumsticks to cut fat, but otherwise kept to the recipe.  Might cut back on red pepper for less spicy palates. A great choice for a cool evening meal!

This was great! I served it over cous cous and it was delicious. I couldn't find the exact brand of potatoes, so I just used a package of frozen diced hash browns, and it worked fine.

I was afraid that all the seasoning would be too spicy, so I cut it by half. When almost done, I tasted it again and put back the rest of the spices. Just the right amount of sauce/liquid to sop up with a piece of crusty bread. DH thought it was yummy too! Would definitely make this one again.

Eliminted the red pepper altogether as kids were eating. Otherwise followed recipe. Forgot to add the lemon juice but it was still pretty tasty. Served with cous cous. Used three diced potatoes + 1/2 large onion chopped instead of the Simply Potatoes.

This was a good recipe.  Not the best, but I think I will be making it regularly because my husband and I both enjoyed it.  I didn't use the simply potatoes and onions, but instead diced red potatoes and an onion.  Also, added extra garlic and salt.  It could have used more chicken - that was my husband's only complaint.

Easy to prepare, but too spicy. If I make this again, I will use only 1/8 tsp. red pepper and crushed red pepper.

Great meal for a cold day. Used diced potatoes and onion instead of "Simply".  Also used 4 large chicken legs.

It was okay.  Not outstanding, not bad, just okay.
