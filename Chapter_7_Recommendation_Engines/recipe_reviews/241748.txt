Very tasty and filling. You can add different pizza toppings such as veggies or pepperoni to change the taste and make it more "pizza-like."

My family enjoyed this casserole and it was so easy to make. I added chopped onions to the meat as I fried it and then added garlic and a littl Italian seasoning to the meat and sauce layer.

This was delicious! I added chopped up pepperoni and bacon bits, and sprinkled with pizza spice. I also cooked it an extra 10 minutes to make sure the biscuits got done. I will definitely be making this again!
