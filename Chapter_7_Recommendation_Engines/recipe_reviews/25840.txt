These are very tasty cookies!  I had to alter the recipe a bit because I didn't have all the ingredients & wasn't able to get to the store due to a blizzard.  Instead of rolling in walnuts, I rolled the balls in coconut (no egg white needed).  I didn't have confectioners' sugar so I skipped the icing part all together...just pressed the kisses onto the tops of the cookies immediately after they came out of the oven.  A big hit with my husband, and me.  I may try the icing next time, but they were so good this time...maybe not!

These cookies were good.  The vanilla icing is a nice touch.  The only complaint is that they could have been a little moister.  I will cut down on the baking time next time to solve that.

This is one of my favorite cookie recipes.  I make some with nuts and some without.  They are good either way!

These were terrible.  They literally crumbled when you touched them.  The taste was not good.  Will never make again.
