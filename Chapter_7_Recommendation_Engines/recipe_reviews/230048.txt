I, being not American, may not be an expert on Ranch Dressings, but I loved this one! Great balance between mayonnaise, sour cream and butter milk. Better with fresh dill and parsley, but I also made it with all drier ingredients, and so long as you let it stand over night, it still tastes great!

This was really good. I only let it sit for about 3 hours and it was already pretty thick by then. I added another splash of buttermilk and it was the perfect consistency!

I've been playing with this off and on for the past few months trying to tweak it to fit my husbands wishes.  Made as recipe directs, it's just a tad to thick for our tastes.  If you want it to taste more like the store bought kind, we've found adding a splash of vinegar or lemon, a pinch of sugar, and another T or so of buttermilk really does the trick.  Thanks so much for recipe!  So much nicer than shelling out $4.00 for a bottle of that mega-factory produced stuff!

I had to use dry spices in this recipe, I adjusted accordingly. I did increase the dill weed, onion powder and garlic powder--besides that, I made no other changes. This was the dressing for tonight's broccoli salad. The consistancy was perfect, it was just what I needed. Very good. It's hard to mess up ranch dressing, honestly.

I have to admit that I've been making homemade ranch dressing for many years, and this one is at least as good, if not better (don't tell anyone!), than mine!  I love the 2 drops addition of worcestershire sauce and the fresh chives.  By the way, Chef J, are you sure that most cowboys are vegetarian?  I live in Texas and know a lot of cowboys-but it makes for a great story!

I kept hoping that the flavors would develop in this but alas even after 72 hours, this still tasted like slightly flavored mayonnaise.  I didn't have Italian parsley and used regular dried parsley flakes but I did use fresh tarragon and a lot of it and still there was no herb taste.  Even my mayonnaise loving dh complained that this tasted like nothing but mayo.  I ended up making up some dry ranch dressing mix from another AR recipe and adding it along with more sour cream.  I hope that is tasty.  :-(

It was great! I didn't have all the spices, so I used what I had which was, garlic powder, salt, and dill weed. I also didn't like how the milk made it runny so the next time I omitted it entirely and instead of sour cream I used yogurt. For those rolling their eyes thinking how I completely changed it & shouldn't rate it, I am putting this to hopefully save some of you some money if you don't have all the ingredients and still want to try this. Like me. It will still taste really good.

Excellent! I love ranch dressing, and this was no exception. I was a bit skeptical about the addition of tarragon and Worcestershire but it worked out beautifully. I opted to use low fat ingredients and after a couple hours in the fridge the flavors blended together perfectly...much better than store bought!

Made exactly as listed.  Too thick and tasted too much like mayo.  Not like restaurant Ranch at all.

4 stars because it tastes too much like mayo when made as is. I added only 1/3 cup of mayo, the second time I made it and the rest plain Greek yogurt. I used the Greek yogurt instead of the sour cream as well. With those changes, this is the best ranch ever!!

This recipe is my all time favorite Ranch! I didn't use the tarragon because I didn't have it on hand. I can't see how it could have made it any better.
This recipe gets 12 stars!!

Blended everything except parsley in magic bullet. Added parsley (dried, will make again with fresh)  and shook it in. Straight off the spoon it was great but I think for my taste I'll add half again of all herbs and spices except cayenne.  We are not big on ranch but really enjoyed this.

I made this without any modification and found it to be the best homemade ranch dressing out there. I use it as a dipping sauce or as a salad dressing for my chef salad with a little more buttermilk. I read some reviews that said it taste too mayo, however, mine did not have any mayo taste. You have to use the right kind of mayonnaise (I use Hellman's Real Mayo rather than Miracle Whip) as well as buttermilk to give it more of a ranch taste. Overall, my family and I really enjoy this ranch dressing and will never buy that nasty store bought dressing again.

Excellent! I've modified it a bit, to suit the family's tastes- dropped the tarragon altogether, more chives (dried) and MORE Italian parsley, plus more garlic and pepper, but it was a hit from the get-go! Thanks for a great recipe- I curtsy in your direction, good sir. I'm now forced to make a spaghetti-jar's worth every week, to keep up with demand, LOL! This is also my go-to for baked potatoes. Uber-yummy!

I was looking for the stuff in the restaurants.  I never liked that famous store bought brand...it never had the same flavor as say a good buffalo wing restaurant or even a good pizza parlor.  So, I made this and tried to reduce the calories.  I put less mayo and more low-fat sour cream. I amped up all the seasonings (dill and chives were fresh).  I must've put about 3 tbsp of garlic because that is what I like about the restaurant versions, but after letting it sit over night it's a little garlic heavy.  I will use less next time.  I did not have any tarragon and I forgot to add the cayenne.   Even with the things I forgot and too much garlic I prefer it to the famous valley.   Thanks again Chef John for another excellent recipe!!!

It made a wonderful veggie dip and my husband can't believe it is not commercial dressing from 'The Valley'.  I added fresh parsley (just because I had it) and a bit extra Worcestershire (just because I have arthritis and have hand control issues).  It was still wonderful and did not taste over-seasoned.  Thanks to the Chef!

This is how I make it! In cases where I don't have the tarragon or Worchestershire sauce, it's been good as well. Use this as your base recipe, and adjust for your own taste. Definitely tastes even better after sitting in the refrigerator overnight.

Bottled Ranch is way too sweet and the stuff in the packet is loaded with MSG. This is the best Ranch I've had in a long, long time. Really, really good.

The consistency is more like that of a dip. It worked great for dipping veggies versus a dressing for salad! I did add a lil extra of some of the seasoning and such because the mayo taste was most prominent and I almost didn't like it, but let me tell ya it gets better the longer it sits in the fridge. Love chef john. :)

Great salad dressing! I used all dried herbs. I had some on a salad after I first made it, but it was much better after a day or two in the fridge. Big improvement over the store-bought stuff! Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! Easy to make. Highly recommend.  I use to make "homemade" ranch with the Hidden Valley powder, not anymore. This is 150% better, worth the extra effort.

I made this the first time he posted it. Haven't changed it since, except adding a little cayenne now and then... lol

As with most of his recipes, the flavors are always well balanced, and his "chef touch" on recipes is nearly always  spot on.

If you haven't made his Creme Fraiche, you're missing something. I'm from the southern U.S., store-bought sour cream is all that we knew; relatives have chided me  over my changing accent.

We really enjoyed this ranch dressing! I did add some extra buttermilk to thin it out. Loved the addition of the Worcestershire sauce too! I did not have any tarragon, so I skipped it. I would make this again, for sure! Thanks for sharing. :)

I heeded some of the previous reviewers' suggestions so I did add extra (half again as much) seasonings as the recipe called for. I  also substituted Greek plain yogurt for the sour cream, because I didn't have any sour cream on hand. It turned out great; thick, but I like it that way. I'd recommend the recipe to a friend for sure.

Fantastic! The perfect ranch dressing. I used fresh dill instead of dried and left out the tarragon because I didn't have any.

It's a bit heavy on the mayo, but that's easily altered. Quite lovely.

Thank You for this. I just completed a batch of Chef John's Pizza Sauce, and my wife said 'hey - look for a pizza dippin' sauce.
 I leafed through too many posted recipes where the instructions were to 'use store bought ranch and add this'.... the rest of us know the value of making from scratch.

I normally follow Chef John's recipes with no changes, but for this one, I used fresh garlic and fresh onion.  When in season, I will use fresh dill as well.  I gave it a spin in the Magic Bullet because of the fresh ingredients, but - with minced garlic, and onion chopped fine, the spin is not needed.
Fantastic!

I loved this! It was so easy! I don't like some ranch dressings so I was able to make this one just how I like it, and I LOVE IT!!!! I totally recommend this. 
The only thing I did differently is that I didn't have any buttermilk, so I used my 1% and added a little apple cider vinegar to do a "faux" buttermilk. I've often done that in recipes and it works just great.

Used what I had in the house: dried chives, sour cream instead of creme fraiche & omitted the Worcestershire sauce (the bottle I had expired 10! years ago!), but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  It's FANTASTIC!!!a

I'll be happy to give this to my ranch-obsessed 9 year old.  I found Chef John on YouTube & came here for the recipe.

As written, the mayo is too much for my tastes. I like to mellow out the mayo, by making up the 1 1/3 cup with mostly Plain Greek Yogurt, sour cream and 3 tbsp of mayo.  I still put in the 1/3 cup of sour cream. It works really well that way, if you are like me and don't want too much mayo taste.  Also, I don't like fresh parsley, so I just throw in tsp of dried.

I wanted to use it as a salad dressing not a veggie dip.  To do that I doubled the amount of buttermilk.  If I make it again I will go with 50/50 buttermilk and mayo.

I’ve made this many times and it is so much better than the bottled stuff. I use a bit less mayo and a bit more buttermilk to make easier to pour.

We have fresh chives nearly all year around.  Most of the rest of the ingredients are ready in the kitchen.  I used cream instead of buttermilk.  Just wonderful flavor and just as Chef John says, so much better than store bought.  Including cutting and mixing the ingredients, it took less than 10 minutes AND was delicious!!!

I’m a Ranch SNOB and I’ll never ever use any other recipe. Made exactly as written and it’s hands down the absolute BEST ranch dressing/dip I’ve ever had-EVER... and I’ve tried them all!  Mixed all spices & Worcestershire sauce together and next I creamed the mayo, sour cream & buttermilk and added it to the spices. I would almost eat this on ice cream - LOL it really is that good. Thank you for another outstanding recipe Chef John!

Wonderful! Tried a similar recipe first with Miracle Whip—still good, but didn’t taste like ranch, too mayonnaisey. Tried it again with olive oil mayonnaise—huge improvement!  So I didn't even try Miracle Whip with this one--might be the problem some have had? This one I started off like the recipe, I think, but have experimented with it a lot since then. My personal favorite changes (I make it like this a couple times a week now): olive oil mayo for the mayo, plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream, 2% milk for the buttermilk, 1 tsp of dried parsley for the fresh parsley, 2/3 tsp dried chives for the fresh chives, and omit tarragon, cayenne, and Worcestershire sauce.

Another ten star receipt from Chef John. I used dry herbs, put in closed jar in refrigerator 3 days before serving. For those people like more herb tease, I double the herbs. Came out great and very tasty.

I made this just as published by Chef John.  I will not make this again.  I've decided I'm not a fan of tarragon, nor do I like sour cream in my Ranch Dressing.  I also do not want parsley in my Ranch Dressing.  I tried this recipe because I'm a fan of Chef John.  Maybe there is something else of his I should try. Sorry Chef John.  This was not a keeper for me.

I'm not a ranch fan but this was very tasty.

Made it again using yogurt instead of sour cream. Not nearly as good

Didn't change anything.  Like just about every other review I think this is one of the best Ranch dressings I've tasted.  Very tasty.  Will definitely make again.

Best ranch dressing recipe. I have made this recipe many times. I love to use it as a base for different flavors. Try adding bleu cheese, bacon, chopped jalapenos, chopped cucumber...the list is endless. Chef John's recipes are simple and versatile. This one is so easy to make and so versatile. I love that I control the salt without sacrificing flavor. I don't bother with bottled dressing since I found this recipe.

Living in Europe now we can't find a good store bought ranch. This is what brought us to making our own ranch. But boy am I glad we made our own. It is so good! Better than anything store bought for sure. On a scale of one to five I give this recipe a ten!!!

Thanks for another great recipe!  I had all fresh herbs which worked out great.  I used dry buttermilk powder mixed with water to thin it out to our desired consistency.  We will not be buying bottled ranch anytime soon!!!

I am not a big fan of ranch dressing but this homemade recipe?   Oh yeah!  A perfect blend of sweet, salty and tang combined with fresh herbs and a few spices make this an outstanding salad dressing or dip.  I did use fresh tarragon and increased the measure to about 1 tsp.

Absolutely loved it!  The first couple of times I made this, I read the recipe as 1/3 cup each mayonnaise, sour cream, and buttermilk.  It wasn't until the third time that I realized that it was suppose to be 1 1/3 cup mayonnaise.  I will continue using the  1:1:1 portion.  Hidden Valley, move off the shelf!

I will make this again.  My husband and I enjoyed it tremendously. I used Kroger light Mayonnaise and light sour cream and didn't have chives so I substituted Howard's Onion Juice which has "onion juice, vinegar and salt" listed for ingredients.

As written, it did taste a lot like mayo after 1 night in fridge.  I then added a 2nd round of the same spices (though I did use 1t fresh dill instead of dried on the 2nd round) and a touch more buttermilk.  It was delicious after it sat overnight again!  I will make again and just double spices and maybe use fresh dill.

I didn't have chives or onion powder on hand so I added 1t of chopped dried onion( cut the recipe down to 12 servings) Also added about 3x the milk to make it thinner. My daughter,who puts ranch on everything was in a panic as we were out of the store bought dressing, loved it and said she'll never eat the other stuff again. Wonderful flavor.

I love ranch dressing, but I hate all the garbage chemicals and high-fructose corn syrup in the store bought ranch.  This recipe starts with mayonnaise as its base, which isn't exactly all natural, but it's not as bad as ranch either.  The rest of the ingredients are pretty straight forward.

This was easy enough to make.  The goopy ingredients aren't easy to measure, but if you whip them up with a rubber spatula they will settle into the measuring cup so you can see the levels.

My wife and I absolutely LOVED this dressing.  It made last night's salad taste like something from an expensive restaurant.  We have plenty left over for the next few nights.

Next time I make this, I think I'll dial down my pinch of salt.  I think I pinched it too hard this time.

The only downside is that this is made from fresh dairy products (sour cream and buttermilk), so it's perishable.  I guess if we really get addicted to this, I'll have to make it once a week or so.

If yours has too much of a mayo taste for your liking (like mine) then add a bit more buttermilk and add a good pinch of seasoned salt.   It will be fantastic with no mayo-e flavor.  Thanks CJ.

I followed the recipe exactly as written except I had fresh dill so I used it instead of dried.  A great dressing and so much healthier than bottled.  I stay away from bottle dressing whenever I can so this was a great one for me and so easy to make.........

This dress is really very good!  My hubby loved it.  I only had time to let it sit for about 3 hours, I'm looking forward to trying it the next day.  I think I might try a little lemon in it.

Since a number of reviews complained about the mayo-heavy taste, I reversed the sour cream and mayo: used 1 cup sour cream, 1/3 cup mayo. The result was good - it's a nice blend of spices - but not spectacular.

We didn't love it.  We found the mayonnaise to be overpowering.

Love this recipe. A bottle of ranch does not stand a chance in my house. Had to triple this. My kids and hubby love this better than the bottled stuff.  And hey I don't have to spend the money on the bottle either its a win win.  Thank you

Edit 12/17--OK I've made this 5 times already since I first tried it two months ago. 


Yes!  Fresh Italian parsley & fresh (garlic) chives are a must.  So good.

This recipe turned out as a great dip for my veges.  I only used 1cup of mayo and tripled the dry ingredients for my family's taste.  I may try this recipe again with even less mayo.

So easy to make and so good - I'll never buy jarred or bottled ranch dressing again!  The only change I made was to use only 1 cup of mayo and substitute a little more sour cream and buttermilk to make up the difference.
