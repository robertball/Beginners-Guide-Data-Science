Has good flavor and it is very hearty. I added a 1/4 tsp of white pepper due to personal preference.

This soup was delicious! I couldn't bring myself to use canned lima beans, though.  I began cooking my frozen baby limas in water seasoned with Better than Bouillon and after about 7 minutes added the potatoes and onions. At the end, I drained the vegetables and saved all the broth. Sure was glad I did because in order for it to be soup, I ended up returning ALL the broth to the mixture. I was afraid to add the cumin but did. It gave it a very nice flavor. I did omit the coriander because I was out. One of the guests I served this to wanted the recipe, so that says much about how it turned out.

It was nice and easy to make. I added chicken broth to thin it out some.

I too like butter beans.  There is a Spanish/Mexican brand of canned butter beans that is superior, in my opinion.  I changed/enhanced this recipe to my tastes.  I have made this with ham per the recipe, also with a ham hock, but it is also good with bacon.  I don't use canned celery soup, but instead use fresh celery sauteed in bacon fat along with the chopped onions.  Add some minced garlic, minced celery leaves, a chopped up carrot, add 1/4 tsp of celery seed, maybe a bay leaf.  Yummy.

Bland without doctoring it up. Was too thick to be soup so I added chicken stock.
