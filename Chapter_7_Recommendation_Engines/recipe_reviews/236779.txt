This is my recipe.  For more lemon flavor, make the following adjustment: Use two 2.9 ounce boxes of cook-and-serve lemon pudding mix (unprepared), and swap a 16.5 ounce lemon cake mix for the yellow cake mix.  It is soooo good.

I used lemon flavored cake as suggested and boy was it extremely lemony. If you really love lemon, then use the lemon cake mix, otherwise stick to the yellow cake mix. I also baked it in a Bundt pan for about 43 minutes and it was very moist and delicious. Huge hit with my friends who really love intense lemon flavor. I'm not sure what other reviews are talking about when they said it was not moist or off putting. Not sure if an ingredient was left out or not.  This is an outstanding copycat of Starbucks lemon bread and I will definitely make it again.

This satisfied my Starbucks lemon bread craving, and my wife can't stop slicing off additional little thin slices.  I am making more tonight!

I loved it!!  I've never had Starbucks Lemon Bread and after making this one I never will. I used a lemon cake mix and had to improvise since I did not have lemon pudding. I substituted Cook n Serve  vanilla  pudding mix and added 2 tsp lemon extract. Very moist with just the right amount of lemon flavor.  Great recipe!!

I've never had the Starbucks version, but I can say this is very good!  I've made it twice now (both times using lemon cake mix), once as a bundt (cook 40 minutes) and a second time as jumbo cupcakes (makes 12/cook 22 minutes).  Both were very moist.  I wasn't a fan of the icing using just powdered sugar and lemon juice, so I added butter as one reviewer suggested, which was thicker and so much tastier.  I used 6 T. butter (room temp.), 6 T. fresh lemon juice, 6 C. powdered sugar.  I also added 1-1/2 t. lemon zest (optional).  If you love things lemony, you'll love this recipe.

This was amazing! And virtually identical to Starbucks lemon loaf.  I accidentally used instant pudding...oops! But I added a little more liquid and it came out perfect. I brought it to work to share and it was gone in an hour!  I would recommend this to anyone and will for sure be making this again!  Thanks for sharing!

Followed recipe exactly but baked in a bundt pan for 40ish minutes.  Turned out moist and delicious.  Brought it to work for a morning meeting and cake was devoured.  Definitely making again soon.

I made this last night and wow, what a hit!!! I had a problem finding the right size of cook and serve lemon pudding, and ended up using a whole package for a lemon meringue pie filling. Since I also used a lemon cake mix, I didn't need to add any of the lemon juice in either the cake or icing. The lemon was strong enough but not over powering. I used a bundt cake pan and drizzled the icing on. It was super moist and my family loved it. I was a great alternative to the lemon meringue pie and I will be making this again!!  :)

OK followed this recipe to a T...mine was not cooked in the middle after baking for a hr and 10 min...was even getting burned on top, but wasn't cooked it was still raw. The edges cooked so at least I tried that part, the taste was there . Also after I took it out it sunk down. Complete waste of ingredients

When I made this recipe I used Instant Lemon Pudding, and I think that it worked out fine. I will have to make it with the Non-Instant Lemon Pudding to be sure.  Also when I made the icing, it didn't taste very lemony. I did want it to have more of a lemony taste so I added about a teaspoon of lemon extract. Overall this recipe was amazing! I will make it again and again.

This recipe was a huge hit at my house. Although this recipe wasn't exactly like Starbucks, I would say it could possibly be better!  I followed the recipe exactly and placed it in a bunt cake and in the oven for 45 minutes. The cake was super moist and neither too sweet nor too tart. I can hardly wait to make it again!

All I can say is- unbelievable! I did use the lemon cake mix and definitely recommend it. I also added a bit more lemon in frosting. I had lots of compliments on this recipe.

Not sure why but mine didn't turn out moist. It was very dry and not like Starbucks at all. Perhaps adding lemon pudding mix, apple sauce or switching to real butter instead of oil might help. Will not make again

The armagazine.com/copycat--lemon-bread recipe was in your magazine. It mistakenly didn't say it made TWO loaf pans full -- therefore, my batter-filled pan overflowed onto the oven floor and made a burnt mess. In tracking down and checking your recipe online, I see that it makes two.  That portion that remained in my loaf pan after trimming and finishing baking didn't taste too bad, but I have since researched and found a recipe that is a R EA L recipe and doesn't use mixes.

I've made a lot of copycat recipes to try and match Starbuck's lemon loaf and this one is my favorite. Although it's not exactly like theirs, it is a really delicious, moist lemon loaf cake that I will make again and again!

Don't do it! This recipe is off. I took a chance and the taste is artificial and off putting. The texture is packy and not in a good way. I am an advanced baker and followed this to a tee.

I’m a big fan of the Starbucks lemon loaf bread and this recipe, although OK, was definitely NOT it.   Starbucks’ bread is more of a pound cake.   This recipe is a different texture not nearly as dense — more spongy like a muffin, and the flavor is different too.   Also,  halfway through the baking process, the loaf rose perfectly and was looking great.  At the end when the timer went off, it sunk down to not much taller than the original batter size.     Not a bad recipe, just disappointing as a “copycat”.

I love Starbuck's lemon cake and  followed this recipe exactlly except for using a lemon cake mix instead of a yellow one.  I knew there was a problem when I took the loaves out of the oven to cool and they shrank down to about 1 3/4 inches tall.  The insides were doughy although the flavor was good.  I would not serve these.  The only thing I could think that went wrong was perhaps gracery stores don't sell too many lemon cake mixes and the one I bought, on sale, was old.

This is a great recipe. I used instant lemon pudding,  but I just used one of the small boxes (2.9 oz),  a lemon cake mix,  and since I didn't have enough lemons to make 6 Tblspns. of lemon juice, I made up for it using Cervasi lemon juice. The lemon flavor was fantastic. Better than Starbucks in my opinion!

I, too made changes/substitutions. I used both lemon cake mix and lemon pudding. I did not use lemon juice in cake batter only in the glaze. I used dark cake pans and removed from oven after 42 minutes, once poked with a toothpick that came out clean.  In the glaze I did 2T butter softened, 2 cups confectioners sugar, and 2 T fresh lemon juice. It is so yummy. Will make again and again.

This is nothing like the Starbucks lemon cake. Bland. Very confused by all the good reviews. Perhaps rubbing lemon zest in the sugar would help it? I do not think the lemon cake mix is the answer. Also, is the weight of the cake mix a typo? All the cake mixes here in the PNW seem to be 15.25oz

I love the idea of this Lemon Bread but the recipe as printed in the Feb/Mar 2018 allrecipes magazine says to use a 5x9 inch loaf pan.  There was way too much batter to fit in a pan this size.  I used that size plus two mini loaf pans which seemed right.  I cooked the 5x9 for the recommended 60 minutes and it looked perfect.  Tested with a toothpick but it was so high the toothpick didn't reach the bottom where it was not fully cooked so  thought it was done.  When I took it out of the oven, it fell almost 1-1/2 to 2 inches.  Although the top few inches tasted delicious, the bottom two inches were rubbery and not fully cooked.  What it the proper size pan to use?  Maybe two 5x9 loaf pans filled only half way?  I want to get this right.   Thanks!

The loafs look good in the oven, deflated once they are removed. It was dense, and not sweet at all. so icing it would just make it weird.

The bread tastes GREAT. I used a gluten free cake mix (yellow cake gluten free by Betty Crocker) and it turned out super moist and yummy. But I did NOT like the icing. It was super off and REALLY distracted from the actual bread.

I have not had the Starbuck's version, so I cannot compare -- however, I do love lemon cake and was very happy with how this turned out.  I could not find cook-and-serve lemon pudding, so I just used a box of instant.  The cake mixes were also 15.25 oz, so I traded out a cup plus the difference of the vanilla cake mix for lemon cake mix.  It made 8 mini loaves and they rose beautifully.  I cooked at 350 for about 25 minutes.  I made my icing a little thinner by using less powdered sugar and used a skewer to poke holes in the loaves so some of the drizzle would soak in.

Eh, ok.  The loaves sunk in the middle and the frosting tasted too "bitter."  I'll try to make some changes to it to make it better.  Otherwise, it tastes nothing like Starbucks.

Since boxed cake mixes are smaller than 18.25 ounces now, I had to use part of another box, and I used Duncan Hines butter recipe cake mix. This was absolutely one of the best lemon cakes I have ever had. I used fresh lemons for the lemon juice and will definitely make this again.

This was wonderful, although I've never had Starbucks original.  I didn't have "cook & serve" pudding so used "instant".  Upped the milk (2%) to 2 cups to thin it out.  I added 1/2 cup at a time as I wanted a certain consistency.  You'll have to judge for yourself.  DID NOT add any lemon juice, but did zest a large lemon for the batter.  May take a few minutes more or less depending on consistency  you want.

It's good, but it doesn't taste like the Starbucks lemon cake at all.  Unfortunately, mine also shrunk as soon as they came out of the oven. All this aside, if you want a lemony cake, this may be what you're looking for. I originally gave it 2 stars because it is nothing  like the Starbucks cake  or icing at all and it shrunk down.  BUT I just got back on to changed it to a 4 because my family LOVED it and so did the people that work with my husband. I used the lemon cake mix. Next time I would cut the fresh lemon juice down to 4 TBSP since I used a lemon cake mix.  Just note that my 4 is on it being a good lemon cake....not on it being a good copy cat. Happy Baking!

This sounds so good. I've made it twice--not impressed either time. If Starbucks serves this, they should be embarrassed. Another reviewer suggested you could successfully make just one loaf by using yellow Jiffy mix, which I did this time. Used one cook / serve lemon Jello pudding mix (dry), halved the remaining ingredients & baked in 9x5 pan. It is very moist and very dense and after cooling, only 1 1/2" tall. I'm giving up on this recipe.

Very delicious. I did find that the loaves sank while they were cooling, although that did not affect the taste. I also could only find the instant pudding, so that is what I used. Next time I make it, I might add either baking powder or baking soda to see if that gives it some height.

I used Betty crocker lemon cake mix so I strayed from the exact recipe since it calls for yellow cake mix;  but it is delicious.  
Very moist.  Will continue to use this recipe.

2 people in the house, made it in small loaf pans.  We ate one, we loved the very lemon flavor, and froze the others.  Haven't thawed them out yet,  but they should be good to go when we can have morning coffee on the deck.

I made the recipe exactly as written.  There was a off taste that I'm not sure what it was.  Maybe the sour cream.  Also the texture was more cake like than a quick bread.  Don't think I would make this again.

I had to add flour since my cake wasn't large enough.  I also doubled the pudding mix like a lot of others did.  It definitely tastes great although not as dense as Starbucks.  My son was disappointed because it only had a hint of lemon flavoring.  Next time, we will use lemon pudding and I'll use some lemon extract.  We are a very lemon household!

I have used this recipe many times before using lemon cake mix and adding INSTANT lemon pudding. It tastes awesome. To be fair I tried it both ways to me not much difference. My husband could not tell the difference. This could be converted to any cake mix using the same directions as written with exception chocolate cake use chocolate pudding, pistachio cake pistachio pudding ect...one last thing increased the oil to 1 cup. I received this way of altering a cake mix from a chef and everyone wants my recipe not telling though have fun baking

Very good and moist cake. but I thought the amount of lemon (I used fresh, squeezed lemon juice) was too powerful on the topping, and would reduce it by half. Otherwise, very good.

I made this last night and I was very disappointed.  Didn't change a thing in the recipe and although it looks exactly like the picture, the taste is less than exciting.  Maybe it was the yellow cake mix I chose.  Perhaps a different brand would have been better, I'm not sure.  But the bread part was just sort of bland and I wasn't a fan of the glaze.  It surely has no business being called a Starbucks copycat because its not even remotely close.  My family, who loves lemon, wasn't overly impressed either.  I think  something from scratch would be better.

This was in the recent issue of Allrecipes magazine so I had to try it.  Their version called for 1/3c lemon juice, 1/3c oil, and 1/3c milk.  I didn't have enough lemon juice for the cake or icing, so I used a dash of lemon extract in both.  I also used regular yellow cake mix and a 3.4oz box instant lemon pudding.  Absolutely delicious, will definitely make again!!!

This was our Christmas dessert- everyone loved it! It was moist and lemony. I used yellow cake mix and only had vanilla pudding, so I added lemon essential oil to taste - we like it lemony but not overpowering. I also used yogurt instead of sour cream. For the glaze I used less powdered sugar, used nonfat milk and again added lemon oil to taste (about 10 drops). Will definitely make again!

Bread turned out good. Nothing that "wow'd" me, but not bad. I did like the consistency of the frosting tho!

Made this recipe without any changes. While it wasn't awful, it certainly wasn't close to the Starbucks version. Wasn't as moist, came out flat. Removing this from my favorites and will keep looking.

I really wanted this recipe to work, but it just didn't. It was very tart, but not in a refreshing lemon way. The bread itself was not very sweet, but the icing compensated a bit for that. I used 2 loaf pans as the recipe states and the loaves were only maybe 2 inches tall. The texture was not as dense as I think a pound cake should be. Although I'm sure I will still eat the loaves, I won't be using this recipe again.

I added 1/2 stick of softened butter to the icing. This recipe is spot on! My hubby said it's better than Starbucks! Oh, and I used the lemon cake mix.

I have made this several times and it is ALWAYS a hit.   I do use the lemon cake mix and 2 cook and serve pudding mixes as other reviewers have written .... however if too lemony for your taste I would probably use the yellow cake mix.

I don't go to Starbucks, but I did make this cake and it was wonderful! I used a lemon cake mix and instant vanilla pudding. I made a sheet cake and iced wih cream cheese icing. Added 1/4 cup plain flour for my high altitude.  Very moist, even the next day!

The cake itself didn't have enough lemon so the next time I make it I'll add so more lemon. The icing was out standing and my family couldn't stop eating it.

Son's g/f works @ Starbucks and she thought it was super yummy!  ; )   Made mine in bundt pan so had to adjust baking time but this cake is very moist and has a nice density to it.   I will definitely make this again.   
p.s.  Used confectioners sugar and lemon juice icing to drizzle over bundt cake but should have let the cake cool a bit more beforehand!   Still delicious ??

I made this to bring to church for coffee hour.  It is really moist and very lemony.  As a matter of fact, it is so delicious that four women at church wanted the recipe!  Guess this one is a keeper!!!

Oh My Gosh! 100% yummy. made the cake per instructions but used a bundt  pan and before I turned the cake over I poked holes in it and poured on a lemon simple syrup. I will be making again probably for a bake sale.

Delicious, used lemon cake mix and baked in a Bindy pan.  Wanted more of a glaze than icing, so I used 3C confectioners sugar, 3T fresh lemon juice, 3T butter  and a bit of milk to thin.  This made about double the glaze I needed, so will make about half next time.  The flavor is fantastic!

Very easy to make, and had dynamite flavor!  The glaze was perfect for it.  I'm going to make it again for a friend's daughter, who has a birthday coming up, and lemon is her favorite cake.  I think I will try using a bundt pan instead of two loaf pans, and possibly double the recipe.  It has a tendency not to rise very much.  But the flavor is great and the cake is really moist.

Made cake in a Bundt pan with lemon cake mix. Very good, but not quite the Starbucks quality. Nice crumb.

This is a good recipe. My first attempt at making lemon cake. The cake is not quite as dense as Starbucks and of course the flavor doesnt quite match. It took a while for me to get the frosting the right consistency.
