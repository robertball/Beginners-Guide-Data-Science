We should have thanked you for this long ago, Kimberley.  It's outstanding!  We have made this one of our regular dishes to prepare for our dinner parties since first trying it.  We've made it at least 7 or 8 times.  We particularly enjoy it on pumpernickle cocktail breads.  Thank you again!

Made this dip for a party and it was great!  The amount this made was just right.  We tried it with Fritos Scoops and sesame crackers.  Both matched the flavor of the dip.  Rich and creamy!
Smells delicious while cooking ;o)

When I explained what was in this dip, people made a face.  When they tried it, it won over the even the toughest critic (my mom).  I used Ground Italian sausage cooked with a little hot sauce.  Instead of pimento, I added fresh chopped red pepper.

Sausage dip is my favorite. For anyone who hasn't tried it tastes great on  italian bread.

This was a very good snack food, but i added too much sour cream.   "Use 8 ounces"  i used the wrong type of measuring cup.

This was very, very good!  I made it and took it to a church potluck and was told -"it better show up there next month"!  I had so many people commenting on how good it was! I served it with tortilla chips.  I also put a couple dashes of worcestershire sauce and a shake of garlic powder.  I doubled the recipe with no problem.  I also rinsed the cooked sausage so try and remove some of the greasiness.  I will be making this again next month per requests!  Try it, I was skeptical but it is really good and it has ingredients I tend to have on hand or in the freezer.

This was so good and too easy!  I made it earlier in the day and refridgerated it until I was ready to bake it.  Still only needed 30 minutes in the oven.  I served it with bread and tortilla chips.  Awesome!

The absolute hit of the party!  Everyone requested this recipe.  Owing to friends who do not like 'spicy' I substituted mild sausage, would love to taste it with the hotter variety.  This is a keeper and a winner.  I served on toasted thinly sliced French bread and it was fabulous.

I made this as an appetizer for Thanksgiving.  My grandmother wouldn't leave it when it was time to sit down at the table and she usually eats like a bird!!!  
EDIT:Every time I make this dip, I use breakfast sausage. Sounds weird, but a spicy breakfast sausage roll gives this dip incredible flavor! 

Thank you so much for an excellent dip recipe!

I didn't have green onions (so I cooked some diced white onion w/sausage) and this was still great!

This didn't receive a lot of attention at my house when I prepared it for football Saturday. I enjoyed it, but expected a more complex flavor. The only substitution I made was to use some hot banana peppers from our garden in place of pimento peppers. The intensity of the peppers is mitigated by the other ingredients, so it may not be as hot as expected. After 25 minutes, the dip had not browned, except on the edges. I would prepare this again, but it didn't blow me away.

I made this for my daughter-in-laws birthday party and everyone really liked it. I mixed it up in the morning and put it in a casserole dish and refrigerated it until ready to go. When I got there, I stuck it in the oven for 30 min. and served it.  In another 30 min., the dip was all gone! Easy to make and delicious, what more can you ask for? Thanks for the great recipe.

My nephew asks for this at every get together. I have altered slightly, so take that into consideration. But it is mostly that I have a family that isn't fond of sour cream. So I cut the sour cream in half and add a half cup of green onion/chive cream cheese in its place. I serve with toasted baguette. Yum!!!

This was really good.  I was looking for a sausage dip that was different from the usual cream cheese or velveeta dip.  I added more cheese and topped it with more cheese.  Served it up on warm toasted crostini's right out of the oven.  This is like eating a mini hot sausage sandwich.  Warm, yummy comfort food!  Perfect "game food"

The sausage I had on hand was Jimmy Dean regular (not spicy), so I added some red pepper flakes and some chopped jalapeño to spice it up a bit.  After 30 minutes in the oven, this was still pretty soupy, so I cooked for another 15-20 minutes allowing some of the liquid to cook down and the dip to brown on the top.  Served with some tortilla scoops.  This would be a really nice opener to a Mexican-themed dinner along with a cold margarita!
