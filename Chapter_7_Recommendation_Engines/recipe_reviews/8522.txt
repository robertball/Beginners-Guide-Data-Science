Just a note to the person who said cutting the mushrooms took the most time.  You can quickly and evenly slice fresh mushrooms using an egg slicer.  Just place the mushroom where the egg goes with the cap towards the hinge, pull down on the cutting blades and a whole mushroom is instantly sliced

This was a good dish. Next time I'll use less salsa.  Also I should point out that the recipe calls for 2 cups of COOKED rice.  If you measure out 2 cups of uncooked rice you will get about 6 cups of cooked rice. Hope this helps.

This is one of my most popular dishes.  My husband loves it.  I like to crumble totilla chips, mix with some butter and sprinkle on top of casserole before putting it in to bake.  It looks nicer to present and it's got some extra crunch!

I tried this with and without mushrooms, and it is definitely better WITH them!  I also added a can of black beans, extra cheese, green onions, and fresh cilantro.  Served it with avocado and warm tortillas - great, easy meal!

This has become a favorite in our house.  I like to prepare a few dishes ahead of time to use in the week or pull out of the freezer for unexpected guests - this recipe fits the bill perfectly.  It is easy to make and tastes great.  Freezes well.

This recipe was great!  I just changed a couple things some of you may be interested in.  I cooked the chicken in taco seasoning and added a can of spicy black beans,olives, taco sauce (in addition to the salsa) and crushed chips and cheese on top to make the dish look more presentable. I didn't use any mushrooms. Just delicious!  My boyfriend loved it and his niece (sometimes a picky eater) liked it as well, it even got my mom's approval.

This recipe was great...it will be a new family favorite. It is very easy to make. I made some changes to the recipe...I added black beans and some hot sauce to the mixture and also sprinkled some cheese on top 5 minutes before taking it out of the oven. I didn't use all of the rice called for in the recipe, maybe only a cup and a half instead of two and I thought that it could use just a little more salsa and maybe some diced tomatoes. It was very very good. I served it with sour cream and tostadas.  Excellent!!!

Very easy and very quick, yet it tastes "Oh so good"! I left out the mushrooms because my husband isn't a big fan of them. I put the rice on the bottom of the baking dish and seasoned some uncooked chicken with "Taco Seasoning II" from this site. I poured  Ortega medium chunky salsa over top and light Mexican blend cheese (a bit more than called for). I baked it at 375 for 45 minutes since the chicken was uncooked. After it comes out of the oven I pretty it up a bit by topping it off with some sliced black olives and thin sliced green onions. The chicken is tender, juicy and delicious! It's great topped off with dollup of light sour cream - YUM!

If I am going to rate your recipe, I am NOT going to change it and then give it a crappy review.  I made this as written, using Roberto's salsa.  My family loved it and thought it was delicious (the kids didn't even complain about the mushrooms which is where the so-good part comes from) I served it with black beans and tortillas on the side.  DE-LISH!!  Thanks for sharing!!!

I loved this and so did my finicky husband. 
To other raters, I add my plea to rate the recipe as is and to find a different place to submit your modifications. I think the submitter of the recipe deserves to have her/his recipe reviewed on its own merits.

I have to admit that I've made serious alterations to this recipe, but it's definatly a keeper. I use pasta (shells) instead of rice because noone in my family are really fans of rice, I add more sour cream, black olives instead of mushrooms, and lots of cheese. It's not an overly pretty meal but it is VERY yummy.

This is pretty darn good.  I made it for a dinner party with Mexican cornbread and it was a big hit.  Here are my changes:  Didn't cook chicken or rice beforehand.  Added 1.5 jars of salsa (to make up for the uncooked rice...it soaked it up), added a can of corn and can of black beans and a package of taco seasoning, baked covered for 1 hour @ 350 then added crumbled tortilla chips and shredded cheese on top then baked 20 mins uncovered.  It was a big hit.

I made this recipe for my husband and his mate to come home to after a winter night fishing trip.  They loved it and scoffed down nearly the whole casserole between them, boasted how good it was and then my husbands friend asked me to give the recipe to his wife!!!

Very yummy!! I used exactly these ingredients for more flavor:
- 3 boneless chicken breasts, diced and skillet cooked with olive oil, hot sauce and garlic.
- 6 table spoons sour cream
- 16 oz Salsa Verde
- half a bag of shredded cheddar cheese
- a whole bag of (90 sec. microwaved) whole grain rice
- 2 cups sliced Bella mushrooms, sauteed like recipe calls for
- half of a red onion, chopped
- one chopped yellow bell pepper
- cilantro to taste
- one can black beans, drained and rinsed
- one large diced tomato

About 4 servings. 
Cooked 350 degrees for 35 minutes.

This is a family favorite of our's too - but to make it even easier we sprinkle 1 1/2 cups of UNCOOKED rice at bottom of 9x13 casserole dish, add 3 cups water (or chicken broth if have), raw chicken breast (pieces or chunks), top with Pace Picante sauce & dollop cheddar cheese soup or slices of Velveeta on the top of each piece of chicken.  Be sure to cover with tinfoil and cook 1 hour at 350 - the rice turns into a Spanish Rice and the chicken is moist with FABULOUS FLAVOR!

I also seasoned the cooked chicken with Taco seasoning mix and in plastic bag and tossed. I added Heinz vegetarin beans and fresh diced tomatoes. Used Uncle Ben's wild brown rice. Money saving tip:  Buy the pre cooked rotissiere chickens and take the meat of them. Much cheaper then the price of chicken breasts today!! Served with Black corn chips. Awesome!!

I made this exactly as the recipe said and we loved it!  I think the key was the salsa.  I used a medium green tomatillo salsa and it had a real zing to it.  A salsa like Pace would be ok, but it would probably be a little sweet.

I've made this with and without mushrooms & it's still delicious. I've made it a few times. Now I add diced tomato and chopped onion & taco seasoning (I use the taco seasoning 1 recipe from this site) to the chicken in the skillet. I steam only 1 cup of rice. I make my own salsa so that's what I used (16 ounces is 2 cups of salsa). I consider this good comfort food. The presentation isn't beautiful, so if you're trying to impress someone, make something else.

I thought it was very good for how simple it is, but with some additions. While the rice was cooking in a rice cooker, I sauted the mushrooms with green onions. When I added the salsa I also added about a teaspoon each of garlic powder, cumin and chili powder. After I mixed everything together, I wanted a little bit more spice, so I added a teaspoon of Srirachi hot chili sauce. After baking for 20 min, I added more shredded cheese and green onions to the top and baked for another 10 min. I served it with a dollop of sour cream.

Great chicken and rice recipe.  My family thought it was good!  It's really more of a Mexican chicken and rice casserole.  I would cook it again.  It was a nice twist from the normal chicken dishes!

Oh so good. I always like to read reviews before making something new, so I followed what a lot of reviewers suggested and that's adding black olives, serving with tortillas, and subbing brown rice to make it just a little bit healthier. ;) I also used a rotisserie chicken and shredded it for extra flavor. YUM!

Good stuff. I sauteed some diced onion and a couple cloves of fresh minced garlic with the mushrooms, used an 8 oz can of Herdez salsa and 1/2 cup of chicken broth instead of a 16 oz jar of salsa. Also, I added 1 tsp of pure Chile powder and 1/2 tsp of Cumin. When it was nearly done cooking I sprinkled crushed corn tortilla chips on top and baked for a few minutes more. Served with chopped fresh Cilantro. Very good!

It's annoying that AR doesn't have a questions/comments section on recipes.  I see a lot of 0 or 1 star reviews that are simply asking questions or leaving suggestions.  Anyway, this recipe is really simple yet tasty.  It's very quick if you have leftover chicken to throw in.  I've also used leftover pork and steak with good results, as well as different veggies (corn, peppers, even black beans).  Once I even threw in leftover pasta instead of rice!  It was different but still good.

Did not use mushrooms (because of the kids), used about 1 1/4 cup of salsa and substituted brown rice for the white. Also added about 1 cup of thawed frozen corn. Very easy and very delicious. The next day, my 13-year-old daughter had it for lunch and dinner again!

this is so darn good! instead of mixing in the cooked rice, i made cilantro lime rice (also from the site) and covered the bottom of the baking dish, then put the chicken/salsa mix on top. Highly recommended!! topped with cheese and crushed tortilla chips. I used more sour cream and cheese than recipe called for. cannot wait to make this again!!!

I tweaked this recipe within an inch of its life, but it turned out AWESOME! Instead of cubing the cooked chicken, I shredded it and prepared it in taco seasoning according to package directions. I added cumin, paprika and half a bouillon cube to my rice as it was cooking. I subbed pico de gallo for the salsa (more flavor). And to the whole mix, I added a drained can of both yellow corn and black beans. Doubled the cheese and served with warm flour tortillas and extra sour cream. My husband flipped-out and declared this his new favorite! Thanks for an AWESOME idea. And thanks to the other reviewers for your great tips.

really good, used as guideline - to save on calories I did not use as much sour cream or cheese,  also used  brown rice, green chilis and added more chicken, little less salsa

Great recipe with some tweaks. First, no mushrooms because we don't like mushrooms. I mixed 3 cups of cooked instant rice, 1 jar medium salsa, 1 can green chilis, 1 can black beans, cooked diced chicken breast, sour cream and extra cheese. The first time I made it as the recipe just minus the mushrooms. It was good but my hubby said it needed more spice and just something "more." Trying it with medium salsa, green chilis and black beans. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This was so good!! The only thing I changed was I did half salsa and half rotel. I also added black beans and corn just because I thought it needed a few more ingredients....yumm!

I made a larger portion of this, and took it upon myself to add some ingredients to the recipe. I sautéed some bite sized bacon pieces with the mushrooms, and when the bacon was almost done, added some diced green and red peppers. I also added more cheese, including some mozza, and some v8 juice. It was freaking delicious. I'll make this again for sure. Kids loved it! Maybe sprinkle some tortilla chips on top?

This was excellent.  I topped the casserole with more grated cheese, then crushed tortilla chips.  Even picky eaters would like this.  Thanks!

This was an amazing piece of work.  Don't forget, you need to cook the rice and chicken separately before you begin  the combination phase.  I did not change anything and it was simply delicious with a white Merlot.  As a leftover, microwave a serving portion 1:30 to 2:00 min for lunch.  It's simply great.

Very good, similar to Chicken Tacos. For dishes like that one and this one, I like to use shredded up rotisserie chicken. A little more fat this way, but much better flavor, and easier, too!

Name says it all! I was actually surprised how well this turned out. It doesn't "look" pretty, but boy did we all scarf it down at dinner. My husband actually wanted to confirm I wasnt making anything the next night so we could finish the leftovers and my picky 2 year old ate it up! Like some of the other reviewers, I made some additions just to make it more hearty. I used brown rice and used only 1 cup. Added frozen corn, 4 sliced green onions, can of rinsed black beans, sliced black olives, and seasoned the chiken with taco seasoning. I served with additional sour cream and pico de gallo. YUMMERS!

We eat this meal frequently. Only modification is that we add a can of rinsed kidney beans before putting in the oven. (Or sometimes leave the chicken out and just use kidney beans for a vegetarian dish)

Totally enjoyed this. Used can of drained mushroom pieces, sauteed one green pepper, one medium onion and two cloves of chopped garlic first. Added more chicken then called for and extra cheese and sour cream. Topped with more cheddar cheese and baked in a 9X13 greased pyrex dish. Came out great. Will be doing this again!

This became a quick favorite in my house.  I leave out the mushrooms because my family doesn't like them.  I also serve it over the rice, and add a little more salsa & sour cream than called for just to make it "saucy."  I have also added shredded mexican cheese over the top and crushed tortilla chips for some crunch.

This recipe, as is, is extremely bland.  I had to add spices to this after it was already cooked, and after doing so, it was much, much better.  I think adding taco seasoning to the chicken before adding it to the casserole would make this dish superb.

I admit that I made adjustments from the beginning, only because the original recipe sounded very bland to me.  Also, because I hate hearing "you know, it would've been better if...".  I added taco seasoning and cumin prior to placing in oven and then added crumbled tortilla chips 5 minutes before completion.  ZERO leftovers!  I will make it again but will add taco seasoning and garlic to the chicken prior to fixing it.  I put this together the night before and it cooked beautifully which gets bonus points from me!!

I made this for my husband and 2 year old.  They LOVED it.  My little one has been such a picky eater and he gobbled this up.  I made some revisions - cooked the chicken in taco seasoning and added 4 servings of uncle ben's white rice.  I omitted mushrooms but added black beans.  I also used Newman's Own pineapple salsa (this was key as it made the recipe a little sweet) with the sour cream and cheese and added to chicken and rice mixture.  I put everything in a casserole dish and topped with cheese and tortilla chips the last 15 minutes.  Must try it this way.  This will be a family favorite!

The name lived up to the flavor of this dish!  My family loved it!  I used the suggestions from others....the tortilla chips and cheese on top....a wonderful addition!  I forgot to put in the sour cream so I put a dollop on in the dish....my family was impressed with the presentation.  I also put onions in with mushrooms....oh sooo good!

Oh-so-good. I thought that I was following the recipe. I looked at it this morning, and was going from what turned out to be faulty memory. What was different...1 large onion diced also some crushed garlic, jalpeno, 3 C of rice. Crushed Tortilla chips on top and cheese. Delish

In the spirit of the reviews on this website...

I found this recipe delicious, though I made quite a few alterations.  I actually used 8 oz of NY strip steak. I grilled it to medium rare and let it rest a few minutes.  I served it with grilled asparagus, twice baked potatoes, and a salad, and my family loved it.  Yum!

Oh, yeah, if you can't read and you've never cooked before, when a recipe calls for cooked rice, if you measure out that much in uncooked rice you'll have way too much...oops!  (note:  I didn't use rice as my dog is allergic)

Very yummy! I doubled the recipe. (but still used only 3 chicken breasts) I added taco seasoning to the chicken while I cooked it, as others suggested I also added pinto beans and topped it with cheddar cheese 20 mins before it was done. My family really enjoyed it. This is a versatile recipe that is quick and easy!

For me, this was just ok.  I followed the recipe as-is with the exception of adding a little more cheese and some crushed tortilla chips to the top during the last 10 mins of baking.  If I make it again, I'll try adding taco seasoning to the chicken like others suggested. I was also thinking this would make a better tortilla filler than casserole.

This casserole is extremely tasty and so easy to make!  Instead of putting all the cheese in the casserole I saved some out, cooked the casserole and in the last 5-10 minutes I put the last of the cheese on top and broiled it until nice and brown.  I'm definitely going to be making this again and again.

A surprising success for a family with finicky taste!  Everyone in the family ate it, my daughter had seconds and my husband had 3rds.  I did modify the recipe to appeal to the blander tastebuds of my kids (my daughter finds ketchup to be spicy).  I made the following changes to accommodate the family:
- sauteed mushrooms and layered it at the bottom of the casserole (my husband and I love mushrooms), the kids not so much so we could give them less
- mixed leftover sticky chicken (also from allrecipes) with a tbsp of taco seasoning and layered on top of mushrooms
- layered corn on top of the chicken
- mixed rice, more taco seasoning, sour cream, cheddar cheese and tomato sauced mixed with cumin (instead of salsa) to give it more flavor
- topped with crushed tortilla chips and more shredded cheddar cheese
It was great.  I'll make this and begin to incorporate more salsa and less tomato sauce until the kids are used to the flavor.  Definitely a keeper!

this dish turned out pretty good however, the amount of ingredients listed failed to fill up my casserole dish.  I would advise anyone to either use a smaller casserole dish or to double the amount of the ingredients.  but overall this was pretty good

This is the first time I've actually changed a recipe...I added seasoned salt, seasoned pepper, and chili powder.  I also shredded my chicken instead of dicing it, and I added cheese to the top near the end of cooking time.  We loved it!!!  This is definitely a recipe I will use over and over again!

I love this recipe and I followed the directions which is not like me.   I will make this over and over.  I like the fact that it didn't call for cream of something soup.  I can make it for my gluten-free friends.  I like to use tomatillo salsa.

Great recipe when you're stuck for something to make and only have a few ingredients on hand. I followed recipe directions exactly and it was a hit! Served wit with a nice green salad and dinner was served. Wonderful.

I followed the recipe exactly, and this was good...but not great.  I was quite disappointed as it had such good reviews.  Still, I may make it again...perhaps I'll go to the other reviews and see if I should change something.

Oops! Forgot to add the cheese into the casserole itself, so I just added it on top at the end. Didn't use mushrooms, sauteed cooked chicken in a packet of taco seasoning mix and water (per directions on pkt), used 3 cups brown rice, and added pinto beans and corn (that's what I had on hand). Served with Baked Scoops chips on the side. Yum! PS -- I did add 2 dashes hot sauce to the mix, along with salt and pepper. My hubby loaded up his plate then doused it cayenne pepper and hot sauce and was in heaven. :) Thanks!

This was SO good! I used black beans instead of mushrooms. I took others' advice and added a packet of taco seasoning, freshly diced tomatoes, and a few dashes of hot sauce.  Delicious and very affordable!  Next time I will add fresh chopped onion as well to add the crunch factor.

Very tasty and easy!  I took the advice of another reviewer and added a can of black beans and some green onion.  This is best eaten right out of the oven, as I found the leftovers to be a tiny bit dry.  Very flavorful and definately a dish I will make again.   Thanks!

This was great! It made an excellent quick & easy lunch and a great way to use up some leftovers. I used a little less salsa then the recipe called for and it was perfect.

What a terrific taste this had !!  Also a great way to use up dribs and drabs of stuff. Used the leftover white rice from a chinese take out, salsa I had made for the Hub's Sunday football game, a couple of sad but still good plum tomatoes to beef up the salsa (there wasn't quite 8 OZ) two slightly wilted scallions, the bottom of a container of sour cream,  (just 8 T. left!) and half of a chicken I had roasted last night ! ....Thanks for sharing and for helping clean out the fridge ;)

Very good!  The salsa definitely gives it a Mexican flavor.  My 6 year old, 4 year old AND 1 year old loved it. I made this with brown rice made in chicken broth, and it turned out very well.  Just beware, though, that a cup of brown rice takes about an hour to cook. I agree with the poster who suggested crumbled tortilla chips mixed with butter as a topping. That added just the right amount of crunch!

For a 9x13" dish, I increased some of the ingredient amounts (and added a few others....otherwise, it's too skimpy):
- sauteed 10 oz. mushrooms, 1 bell pepper, 1/2 onion, and 2 cloves garlic in butter
- 3/4 C yogurt
- 2 C cheddar cheese
- 16 oz. salsa
- 3 C cooked brown rice
- 1.5-2 lbs. chicken (boiled)
- 1 can black beans
- fresh cilantro
- diced green onion for the top - makes it pretty!

Very good!

I made this exactly like the recipe, and it came out perfect with awesome flavor!  This is one of my new favorites!  This seriously is the best chicken rice casserole I have ever had!  You can add different foods to it, and make it however you want or change it up if you feel like it.  Someone suggested black beans and tortilla chips.  Seriously, if you are looking for a spanish rice type dish, you will love this!  I am incredibly impressed with how awesome this turned out!

This was very good.  Just a little runny so I might cut back on the salsa next time.  I used Trader Joe's frozen brown rice and fat free sour cream.  By my calculations it's about 7 points+ for a 1 cup serving. 
It fills a 9x 13 pan.  I had lots of leftovers since there was only two of us.  I'm going to use the leftovers to stuff some bell peppers.  Should be yummy!

This was so yummy! I doubled the chicken, added green chilies, 1T taco seasoning, and half an onion. I also heated up some refried beans and spread it on a tostada and then put the chicken mixture over that with sour cream and salsa. Awesome recipe!

This recipe is delicious! I altered by cooking frozen boneless chicken, salsa, canned mushrooms and a little water in the crockpot.  Once the chicken is cooked through, I add 2 cups of Minute rice for about 20 minutes.  Then, I pour the mixture into a 9 x 13 casserole, add sour cream and sprinkle with cheese.  Last, I warm in 350 degrees oven for about 10 minutes.  DEEEElicious!

Pretty yummy!  I spread refried beans on the bottom of the pan, baked tortilla strips on top, as well as extra cheese and a sprinkling of green onions.  The crunch added something.  Made it without mushrooms.

This recipe had really wonderful flavor, but a slightly unappealing texture for me.  I will make this again, but next time I will shred the chicken and make the sauce on the stovetop and serve over rice rather than as a casserole.

My first thought was that this was okay, but once I got a bite of chicken with the rice and flavorings, it grossed me out.  The chicken did not go well with the other flavors.  Maybe it would taste better with hamburger.  I will not be keeping this recipe in my cookbook.

Alright, I am going to say this right off the bat, I changed this recipie quite a bit.  I added 1/2 a pack of taco seasoning, about 1/3 of a cup more sour cream, 1/2 a jalapeno pepper, and some habanero cheddar cheese.  This added a bit of spice to the dish (and I love some spice!).  Also, instead of rice I used mini penne pasta.  It was good and very simple!

Yep, good, simple to make meal.  I served mine in fresh flour tortillas to make it easier to serve outside (as wraps).  The type of salsa probably really matters in this dish, as far as flavor.  I used Pace Medium and it was great.  Next time I think I may use mexican rice and try the crunched up tortillas/butter mixture on top that another reviewer suggested...

Very good. Made it in a pinch to use sour cream and mushrooms before they went bad. I used rice a roni chicken flavor instead of white rice and sooo good! Fiance loved it-made sure to brown the top by putting it on Broil in the oven. Used homemade salsa and had a nice kick!

It was an ok recipe. My husband wasn't convinced that it was "oh so good". I probably won't be making this one again. Nice try though.

Very easy meal.  It tastes good but I think the chicken definitely needs to be seasoned otherwise it is very bland.  Taco seasoning, salt/pepper, or however else you season chicken.  I used 2 chicken breast and browned them in the skillet before putting in the oven.  Also added can of corn and black beans.  Also suggest more cheese then the recipe calls for.

Very easy and delicious recipe. I followed exactly except I used brown rice instead of white, added a bit of extra sour cream, and sauteed green onions with the mushrooms. I also took the advice of some of the other reviewers on here and mixed some butter and crushed tortilla chips and put those on top for an extra crunch. Served it with extra sour cream, green onions, and chips. Family loved it. I'll make a double batch next time and freeze one for later!

I really liked this (made it exactly as described), but my husband and son felt the chicken was a bit bland and would have been more flavorful if the chicken had been seasoned or marinated in something before cooking. Will definitely make again with some adjustments!

My Boyfriend and I loved it I am a massive cheese lover myself.It was great to come home to such a comforting meal. We are big vegetable fanatics so we ate collard greens with the dish(odd choice) but it worked well. He did deviate a little bit, instead of cooking the chicken all the way on the stove we cooked it until almost done, we added two types of mushrooms for more flavor(button and portabella). We added way more cheese and mixed it in after averything came off the stove before baking. Other than that this was phenomenal next time we are going to try addign some corn in the mix a nice vegetable to continue with the tex mex flavor.
Thanks

Fantastic!  Here's what I did differently.  For the cooked chicken, I sprinkled 2 boneless breasts with some onion powder, chili powder, salt and pepper and baked at 375 till done.  I added about 1/2 cup chopped onion and some minced garlic to the pan with the mushrooms.  I also added a small can of sliced olives and a can of rinsed black beans to the chicken mixture.  I only used 1 cup of salsa and that was perfect for us.  I served this with flour tortillas for wrapping and everyone loved it!

Really good- I halved the amount of salsa, added corn and used leftover mushroom rice and fried rice.  Really good and easy - didn't have taco seasoning on hand so I seasoned the chicken with cajan seasoning - delish!

This was a unanimous "thumbs down" from my whole family. Not only is it an unattractive dish but also sour in taste (from the salsa, I guess)and the texture is very boring. It's not even worth doctoring up.

Oh-so-good chicken has become a favorite in our house.  I like to add chopped or diced tomatoes to add texture.  Sometimes I add a chopped jalapeno to really make it spicy.  People always ask for the recipe.

I just made this dish for 3 others who have eaten several other chickenrecipe.com dishes, and this one rated on top of them all.  Filling, tasty, and different.  The longest part is slicing up the fresh mushrooms to saute'.  But, it is certainly worth every second.  YUM!

Used this recipe as a base, added corn, black beans and black olives and finished it off with crushed Doritos on the top.   I sauteed the chicken with just a splash of soy sauce, salt, pepper and cumin.  Family loved it and I will defiantly be making this one again and keeping it in the monthly rotation!!!

This is a really great recipe just the way it's written.  It's become a staple at our house.    After making it exactly as the recipe is written several times we started experimenting.   It works well with a topping of mozzarella cheese in addition to the cheese it calls for.   We also like sliced olives in it and chopped up asparagus or broccoli.   We also like it better with some extra cheese--everything is better with more cheese!   We have also made this with small shells instead of the rice which was equally tasty and we also tried it once with marinara sauce instead of salsa (we were out of salsa), which was very different than the original but equally good.

I love this recipe and I have modified it many times.  Sometimes I use shrimp instead of chicken.  When I do that I often use Mango Salsa instead of regular salsa because mango tastes so good with fish and shrimp.  As a special treat I sometimes cover it with quartered artichoke hearts and then cheese and then bread crumbs.  Yummy.

This was very good, I got rave reviews, but did tweak it a little bit.  I used half sharp cheddar, half chihuahua cheese I shredded myself.  I added a small can of sliced black olives and for the salsa I used Xochitl brand Salsa Verde Mild (green salsa) with several dashes of Franks Chile Lime Hot Sauce, a little Cumin, Onion Powder and a little extra sour cream.  I definitely recommend the mushrooms, it provides additional texture.

Yes, I followed the recipe exactly.  The problem is, the rice and mushrooms don't act as much of a filler.  If you want to try this dish, I'd suggest using 1/2 the recommended salsa and sour cream, and maybe add some black beans.

Not a fan. I made exactly as directed and it is bland bland bland. The only way to make it edible is to dress it up with hot sauce and pico and the  only  thing the mushrooms added was expense.  Unfortunately I made a lot to add to my freezer meals. Maybe I can pawn it off on my sons friends from college.

I make something similar with red beans and rice, chicken with taco seasoning and salsa with corn and black beans. Soo much flavor. I top it with crushed tortilla chips for something crunchy and cheddar cheese.

What a wonderful casserole!  The size casserole wasn't specified, but this fit nicely in a 9x9 square dish.  I baked the dish for 30 minutes and during the last 5 minutes, sprinkled a little extra cheese across the top and put pickled jalapenos across half to give those of us that like things spicier, a little kick.

Success with my husband last night, followed others tips and added taco seasoning to the chicken and more cheese. Fresh mushrooms are the way to go!

mom made this for dinner the other day & shared - I love it!  she didn't add mushrooms, but did add a small can of the chopped green chiles, and probably extra cheese, knowing mom!  I'll make it hotter with jalapenos instead of green chiles, and definitely NOT mushrooms, they don't fit with the Mexican flavors.  I'll probably throw in some sliced black olive tho - that would be yummy!  I think this would be good with pork instead of chicken also.  mmm - making me hungry just thinking about it!

This was a very good recipe and very easy to make.  I didn't have fresh mushrooms, so I used canned.  Next time I will try the fresh one because I think it would be better with fresh.

I had been looking for something different to add to
recipie arsenal since the same ol' stuff was getting boring.So I made this tonight for the first time. Pretty Much followed the recipie as written.It was really easy and  really good. I used canned (drained) Mushrooms and Pace Medium Salsa. The only thing I  added was crumbled tortilla chips on top. Mine did not come out runny at all. My partner raved about it. Will add this recipie to the regular rotation!

This was wonderful. Everyone really liked it very much. I did add jalapeño black beans, but would also be great without. I think the sautéed mushrooms add a lot to this recipe.

Very good.  Did top with buttered crunched up tortilla chips and used a little more sour cream and cheese than recipe called for.  Topped with additional sour cream.  This would be great in a wrap with sour cream and pico de gallo sauce.  Will definitely make again!

My family loved this. I used as a filling and rolled up in tortilla bread. The only suggestion that they had was to add MORE salsa. I agree..I had decreased the salsa as many reviewers had recommended, and I regretted it. Next time I will definetley make it with the full amount of salsa that the recipe called for.

I was expecting this dish to be a little boring but it was quite tasty and it got a thumbs up from the whole family.  I took a reviewers advice and added tortillia chips to the top with a little cheese.

This was good with some of the additions recommended by other reviews- added black beans, used leftover brown rice, more sour cream, less salsa, and crumbled tortilla chips over the top.  Served with fresh sliced avocado. Served with tortilla chips- almost more of an appetizer than a casserole.  Next time I'll try it as a tortilla filler.

Super easy and everyone loved it (including my picky 15 month old).  I made three little changes.  I cooked the chicken with taco seasoning, added olives and topped it with cheese for presentation.  Oh So Good!

Tasty!  Made some modifications as suggested below.  I used a can of black beans instead of mushrooms, and added 1/2 c of frozen corn niblets and some chopped cilantro.  I also topped the casserole with another 4 oz of shredded cheese and broiled it on low for about 4-5 minutes after cooking.  I added a bit of salt and pepper when I mixed everything -- it didn't need the salt; there's plenty in the cheese.  
I'll be playing around with this one.  Could be garnished with avocado and other tasty things when ready to serve.

I love this! I did add some black beans and about a cup and half of cooked rice instead of 2 cups. I also cooked the chicken in garlic and fresh parsley. I served it on tostadas with avocado and salad on top I have a family of four so there was alot left over so the next night I made enchiladas with red sauce and it was great also

I made this tonight for dinner. I didn't have mushrooms so I used canned corn, diced red pepper, sliced green onion, and black beans instead as per suggestions from other reviewers. I also added some cumin, cayenne, and pepper to the chicken while it was cooking and some shredded cheddar to the top of the casserole for the last 10 minutes of cook time. I will make again and I will do the same changes.

One of our new favorites. Really easy recipe that allows you to toy with the measurements to meet your taste preferences without compromising the dish overall! We've used a lot less chicken & it's still very filling & seemingly full of chicken! I would suggest picking a good, fresh salsa from the cold section of your grocery story (vs. the room-temp, non perishable brands).

I made several adjustments to suit our tastes(taco seasoning as the chicken cooked, brown rice, caramelized peppers/onions instead of mushrooms, and rotel rather than salsa). This was a quick, easy, gluten free meal. Thanks! PS I actually ate the leftovers. That is unusual!

My kids went crazy over this. I did use a bit less salsa, a bit more cheese, and 1 cup of black beans. Crushed tortilla chips on top, and then more cheese. Absolutely perfect way to use up leftover chicken and rice. Would be great as a burrito filling.

I made this just recently and it looks good.  It even smelled good while it was baking.  My husband and I couldn't get over the mushy texture and the lack of flavour.  We ended up using it as a dip and eating it on nacho chips, not as a meal.  I will definitely not make this again.

We loved this recipe. Its great just as it is. I have been trying to cut down on carbs and fat, so I cut the rice to one cup, instead of cheese I just put more salsa on the top. I also added some onion in mixture. This is a real keeper!!!

Just made this meal when I needed something fast for dinner that included chicken breasts. It's GREAT! And so flexible...I used a green bell pepper sauted in butter because I didn't have mushrooms. It gave the dish a great flavor..very poblano-like. I'm sure mushrooms are awesome in it too and I will try it next time. Definately add the crushed corn chips to the top, they add a nice crunch to an otherwise mushy casserole. Loved it and will make it again!

I love mushrooms, but they seemed out of place in this recipe. We added black beans to this recipe and sprinkled it with crushed tortilla chips and cheese. Which I think was a great choice, but again, I will leave the mushrooms out next time!

I guess I am wierd because this dish was not good at all. It was boring. The mushrooms didnt have a place in it. I did put cheese on top, but that didnt even help it.

Oh so good!  A little time consuming with the cooked chicken and rice. You need quite a large head start when preparing this dish.  I added chopped onions and celery to the mushroom saute.  I also omitted a little salsa. I didn't have enough sour cream so I added 3 oz. of cream cheese.  After cooking for 25 minutes, I stirred it and put it back in the oven for an additional 20 minutes in order to reach temp.  Then I uncovered it (I covered it with foil so it wouldn't dry out) and added 4 oz. more cheddar cheese to the top and put it back in the oven to melt.

I made this pretty much as written--I added some whole kernel corn and black beans. I was hoping this would be a quick substitute for my wife's "best ever" spicy chicken casserole. (It uses "Rotel" tomatoes, cream soup and tortilla chips but needs to be assembled a day ahead of cooking! Not exactly 'quick and easy') 
Sadly, this is not the one for us. Not much flavor! If your crew doesn't care for spicy food this might do for you. We like our food pretty hot. This was just too bland. We even put some more hot sauce on top of it, which helped a bit, but still it was lacking something. 
It was quick and easy to put together put the flavor just wasn't there for us. 
I doubt I will make this again.
Thanks for the recipe and I am glad that so many like it.

I love this recipe but can't give it 5 stars because the family did not.  It was "spicy" said the kids....and husband liked it until he spotted a dreaded mushroom. :-)  I also added black beans and crushed tortilla chips on top.  It was a great use of some cooked rice I had in the fridge.  Thank you for the recipe.

This is a very good recipe, but the next time I make it I'll omit the mushrooms.  Somehow, they didn't seem to quite fit with this recipe; but we did enjoy this overall, and I will definitely be making this again.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

great recipe, after reading reviews i omitted the mushrooms and added a can of drained black beans.  i sauteed onion with my diced chicken and then added the beans, salsa, rice and cheese and put it in a casserole dish.  i mixed 1 cup cheese with the rice and then covered the top of the casserole with cheese so it would get nice and melty!  thanks for the recipe (didn't have sour cream, still great)

This was super yummy and easy!  I added black beans, and Taco Seasoning (from this site) and I think I will add olives next time.  I like this a little better than the Salsa Chicken recipe on this site  Will be adding this to the rotation for sure.

This was an easy AND delicious recipe. I read some of the previous reviews and made the following modifications: -Coated 2 chicken breast in taco seasoning and baked. -Added black beans
-Sauted mushrooms with onions & minced garlic. -Crushed chips on top & add Chedder cheese The next time - because there will be a next time - I will omit the mushrooms, they're really not necessary. Again, Great Dish!

Amazing!  I loved this recipe.  I didn't add mushrooms, since I hate them and it cut out all the oil needed.  It still turned out amazing.  It's so flavorful and my mouth is watering just thinking about this dish.  I used a medium salsa, half of a 16oz jar.  I put taco seasoning on my baked chicken breasts and then put that in the dish.  This is a great way to use up left over rice!

Easy and delicious way to use up left over chicken.  Rolled it up in some soft tortillas and made burriotos that the whole family ate!  Even a picky teenager.

LOVED this recipe!  Quick and easy.  I had everything I needed on hand except white rice, so I used brown rice instead.  I doubt there was much difference.  My husband loved it so much that when the pan was empty, he ate what was left on our picky daughter's plate!  Yummy!

This recipe tasted okay. I made it pretty much as the recipe said except I left out the mushrooms. It tasted like some type of filler for a fajita or something. My husband and I both mildly liked it but we will not make it all the time.

Wonderful.  Nice change for a caserole.  I used southwestern salsa- the beans and corn were a nice addition.

One of my favs for my portion control diet.  I've made it several times and just finished a quadruple batch that yielded 20 one cup servings.  I freeze, thaw, and microwave and the taste and consistency remains great.  I haven't even thought about altering the recipe, as i like it as is.

We really enjoy this dish.  It is easy to prepare and easy to customize.  I generally season my chicken with Mexican seasoning blend.  I often use plain Greek yogurt in place of sour cream.  Sometimes, I will add beans and/or corn.  I use our favorite hot salsa from the refrigerated section.  I mix half the cheese in and top with the rest.    We really enjoy the mushrooms, and even add more!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I added some chopped jalepeno and it gave the recipe a little kick, which it needed.  

Even dried chilis would work.

What I love so much about this site is finding a dish that appeals to me, and then pouring through reviews that give wonderful personal critiques and suggestions regardless of whether or not it strays from the original recipe.   Someone who loves this recipe but loves it even more if they add black beans or diced tomatoes should have to write their own recipe so I can't find brilliant advice right here? This attitude is the the polar opposite of what makes this site amazing.   This recipe was delicious, however please don't disparage my opinion when I carelessly threw the original recipe aside by adding extra cheese to the top under the broiler. ;)

Love this dish, I've made it four times in two months & it rocks every time!  Used the suggestion of crushing tortilla chips in butter & adding to the mix & as garnish.  Also sauted 1/2 onion & 2 tsp minced garlic first & added the chkn to it to cook.  Thanks!

Nice flavor and easy.  You could easily add some jalapenos if spicey is your thing.  I used an 8 oz package of mushrooms and wouldn't have minded more.  I will probably work in a little taco seasoning spices in the future.  I'm sure black beans, olives and/or corn would also make nice additions.  This fit nicely in an 8x8 pan.

My family loved it!  Packed with flavor!  Lots of leftovers!  You can cut it up after thoroughly cooling it.  Then put it on parchment  paper in servings and freeze it.  Then I use my Foodsaver and vacuum suck the air out and it stay fresh for a couple of months!  Winner!!

A little dry for our taste. Next time I would probably add some more sour cream and not cook the rice all the way first.

This turned out pretty good but I thought something was missing so I took the casserole and made it into stuffed bell peppers.  I added some tomato sauce and some cheese to the top and baked it.  Of course I precooked the bell peppers some first. It turned out really tasty!!!

Ok, ok, I changed it but I read the reviews and I combined what all the reviewers said. I added 2 Tbsp minced garlic and 1/2 chopped onion to the oil and sauteed with the chicken breast. Then I added the rest of the ingredients (but used 4 C cooked rice because I can't seem to make less than that)including the mushrooms and sour cream, along with 1/2 tsp dried cilantro, and 1 tsp cumin powder, a can of Progresso black bean soup (which I thought was a can of black beans until I pulled the top off) and a can of drained corn. I spooned it into a casserole and topped with the shredded cheese and baked until warmed through 15-20 minutes. I have to say it was really good! I have no idea what the first version tastes like so don't listen to me when you try this. I thought I would give you a little insight on what I did. Maybe you try it plain or with the additions, either way I'm sure it would be good. Let me know what you did!

Enjoyed this recipe - followed another reviewer's advice and cooked chicken and rice together with all the ingredients.  Doubled salsa amount to have enough moisture for the rice and chicken. Topped it with chips and cheese the last 20 minutes too.  Family loved it, will make it again!

This was great! I used an extra cup of rice, extra chicken, extra sour cream, extra cheddar, extra mushrooms, and a little less of the salsa. I cooked the chicken in Italian dressing. I topped the dish with more cheese and crushed corn chips! The whole family loved it! A little dollup of sour cream and a side salad! Yumm!

Really liked this. Only change was to add crushed tortilla chips on top. Although I really like mushrooms, family and I felt that this was an odd ingredient for this dish. In future, I will add black beans and corn instead of mushrooms.

This is so easy and yummy. The receipe uses all famliar ingredients that most people love. Yes, I added black beans.  This added protein & substance but no matter what twist you put in, it can't be ruined.

I made this as written, no additions. However, the cooked chicken breast I had on hand came from a smoked chicken, which did add it's own flavor. The mushrooms may seem strange with salsa, but don't leave them out. Adding a little more Mexican spice would be good, especially if you don't have smoked chicken. Black beans would also be a nice addition.

This was a really good recipe.  I got lazy and took some short cuts.  I didn't cut the chicken into small pieces.  I just layered the pieces on the bottom of the baking dish and poured the other mixture on top of it.  I used medium salsa which gave it a little kick. That might help for those reviewers who said it needed a little more flavor. It also helps to season the chicken well when you're cooking it. In addition to the cheese in the recipe, I put a thing layer of cheese on the top of the casserole just before i put it into the oven. That makes it come out nice and pretty.

My husband and son loved it and well, for some reason I couldn't stop eating it either.  The dish was not pretty and it almost seemed like a side item rather than a main dish - so I wasn't sure if I would save this into my recipe box but my husband called me this afternoon to tell me that he ate the leftovers of this dish from last night and he hardly ever eats left overs.  I think I will jazz it up next time with the additional suggestions others have made. I kinda was liberal and not proportionate in my choice of ingredients so it would be hard to mess this dish up and not taste good.

This is such a yummy dish! And it's just perfect for "customizing"! For instance, we love black beans, so I added some to the dish. If you don't like them, don't add them. Do you like diced chiles? Throw them in! Don't like mushrooms? Leave them out! :-) Make this YOUR dish by adding (or even subtracting) from the ingredients list. In addition to adding the black beans, I also used a bit less sour cream, added a can of southwestern style corn (by Green Giant) and used brown rice instead of white. Yum!!

This was really, really good. I used no mushrooms because I was out, I threw in some canned corn instead. On the side I served tortilla chips, and I used some really hot salsa, in fact I almost made it too hot for the kids but my husband and I loved it.

Its great to have these recipes - some as a starting point.  I like to add a little more creativity so -  I sauteed the mushrooms with a bit of the salsa, added a small can of diced green chilis (really good), a dash of cayenne powder and a sprinkle of crushed red peppers!!

Fantastic!! I made this recipe two nights ago, as I was looking for something quick and with ingredients, I already had on hand.  My fincky toddler loved it :)  However, I did alter the recipe a bit. Used about half the jar of salsa, instead of the full jar, used brown rice (which I already had pre-cooked) instead of white rice, used the tex mex shredded cheese in place of cheddar and added a green bell pepper.  I was impressed with how tasty this dish was, and will definityly be making it again :)  Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe, although I did make some changes. I added 2 cans of seasoned black beans, the juice of 1 lime and fresh cilantro. For the sauce, I used a little bit of taco seasoning, water, some salsa, taco sauce and some dashes of chili and adobo chili powder. After it cooked for 20 minutes, I topped it with crumbled tortila chips an cheese as others have suggested. Yummy!

This recipe was very good, I do however think it only needed one cup of cooked rice.  I will spice it up a bit more the next time. I will add red pepper flakes and us a hot salsa and maybe a teaspoon of cumin.  Overall the recipe is a keeper!

This was good. I followed the advice of some other reviews and did what would be best for my family and I. I would say it has a bad after taste. It's good but not "the bomb". Would serve as a good dip. Something good for the guys during football. Also would be a nice easy dish to bring to a gathering. Also this should have a different name. :-)

I have to admit that I was skeptical at first, but this recipe was really good. I used Casa Sanchez medium salsa and it was really tasty. I think i'll make tortilla's or a salad with this next time.

This dish is super easy and Oh-So-Good!!! I did add fresh cilantro and black beans to it. I also topped it off with crunchy tortilla chips. Looks better and oh I love that little crunch with it. Making this again for sure!

I'll give this five stars simply b/c everyone who ate it raved about it. I was a little disappointed when I started making it as it seemed like such a simple recipe. Now that was my favorite part. It couldn't be more simple to make and it was a hit!

Awesome recipe. I omitted the mushroom and added a handful of cheese on top (for broil) and half a package of Old El'Paso Burrito seasoning mix (no water of course). I only used 1 cup and a bit of salsa in the dish (instead of the recommended 2 cups.). Turned out great, we ate it with Tostitos.

Made it the first time (sans mushrooms), and it was very good (albeit ugly).   To add a bit more nutritional value, this time I sauteed onions, garlic and shredded carrots with the mushrooms and I tossed in a handful of fresh spinach after turning off the burner. (If I had brown rice, black beans or corn on hand, that would've been added, too.) I also used leftover rotisserie chicken.  To make it more attractive, I layered the rice (bottom) in the pan, a bit of cheese, and the chicken-veg-salsa mix. Topped with more cheese and crushed tortilla chips.   Sadly, I won't be here tonight to enjoy it, but am eager to nom on the leftovers. Hopefully my family will give me a good review (and pay no attention to the veggies).

Easy + Yummy=5 stars!  I just made this dish, minus the mushrooms, and it is delicious.  My 4 kids, ages 6 through 14 also liked it, which says a lot!  I think the addition of corn would be nice.  I put my serving in a whole wheat tortilla for a chicken & rice burrito, but chips or just a spoon work for me!! I recommend heating the mixture in a pan or the microwave if your in a hurry.

This is the best chicken casserole I've ever had.  The ingredients don't sound that exciting but when they are all cooked together - wonderful.  Try using salsa verde!!!!!  and I added 1/2 packet of Lawry's fajita seasoning.  Gives it a little more zip.

This was good.  I made it exactly as written and thought it could use some better seasoning.  Next time I think I'll mix in a taco packet.  It might be better as a filling for a soft tortilla too!

Love this recipe.  For my rice I cooked a package of lipton mexican rice and used it instead.  I also crumbled tortilla chips on top and drizzled with butter before putting it in to bake.  Excellent dish the family loved it!!!

Good recipe. I used skinned chicken quarters, covered them lightly with taco seasoning and baked at 350 for about 45 minutes, then cut up/shredded the meat. I mixed an entire 16 oz container of sour cream with about 6 oz of salsa (all I had on hand) and the remaining 1/2 the envelope of taco seasoning. I also added a can of black beans and a can of corn. I covered the dish with more shredded cheese shortly before it was done and served it with tortilla chips. Went over really well for my boyfriend, 12 and 7 year olds. Will make again!

Acutally, this dish tasted better on the second day; however my family enjoyed it. I have to play around with the spices (cumin, cilantro, another brand of salsa, ???) to give it a kick, but definitely a keeper. Thanks!

This was very good.  I cooked the chicken in taco sauce like someone else recommended - this turned out well.  I added black olives and next time I'll only use about a 3rd of the mushrooms recommended.  I served this with corn.  We ate off of this for 3 nights!  Thank you.

This was very good. I used medium salsa (I may try hot next time) sharp cheddar cheese and instead of plain white rice, I used a chicken and herb flavored rice. Next time I make it I may add some broccoli florets. I felt like it was missing vegetables.

This was a soul satisfying meal. I thought I would add a few more ingredients to see what would happen and it turned out great!  Add 1/2 chopped onion to the mushrooms to saute. Salt & Pepper either chicken or ground beef they both taste great! 1 can of chopped black olives. 1 can of creamed or whole corn for more texture. I cooked the rice in a can of chicken broth and added water to get the right quantity of liquid for the rice. Season with parsley and salt, pepper and garlic & onion salt. My family and co-workers raved how much they liked it.

This is a great recipe.  I am making it for the second time tonight.  I did change a few things.  I add 3 cups of cooked broen rice and the salsa I used was only 430 ml(which is a little less than 8oz).  I also chopped up some jarred halapenos.  I also as another reviewer suggested grate cheese over the top close to the end of the baking time.  Great recipe.

I usually don't rate a recipe unless I've tried it "as written" first, but this was excellent, so I had to give it proper credit!  I kept the rice and other ingredients separate and just served the chicken/mushroom/sour cream mixture over the top of the rice (because my husband doesn't like casseroles, but I can sneak it by if I keep the rice separate!).  I will make it again as-is later because I LOVE casseroles!  But, know that it's quite tasty even if you don't want to bake it for 25 minutes. :-)

Made it without the mushrooms. It was ok, but I think it needed more spices. Definitely add garlic powder, salt, and pepper next time.

I will give this a 5 for being a very tasty and easily adaptable recipe.  I found this recipe using the ingredient search.  I used instant rice made with chicken broth, sauteed canned mushrooms with some diced green pepper and onion for some added veggies, use a large can of chicken  (easier than cooking breasts), a cup of salsa, and used a mexican blend cheese (accidentally added a whole cup).  Oh, and I added a can of corn as well.  Next time I'll try adding black beans.  A definite easy keeper to add to the rotation.  Thank you!

Very good, for a family like mine, that likes mexican food.  I used 1 lb of chicken and kept the rest of the ingredients the same.  I served it with chopped tomato, shredded lettuce and sour cream on top of each hot serving.  I will make this again!

Easy and good.  I only made two changes.  One, I used canned mushrooms instead of fresh and two I only used 8 oz. salsa.  That was plenty for us.  Otherwise a good recipe.  A keeper!

Ok, I love mushrooms but didn't have any on hand, so I left them out.  I also doubled the recipie and I didn't think 2 cups of rice was that much (we love rice). We also held back some cheese and put it on top during the last 5 min of baking.  Phenominal!  This recipie has ALOT of flavor and there are some variations I can't wait to try - adding black beans, tomatoes, corn etc. Very satisfying if you are hungry!

This recipe was just okay for me.  My husband thought it was okay and my 18 year old son liked it...but he'll eat anything.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated except that I only put mushrooms in half (some don't like mushrooms) and I topped the casserole with crushed tortilla chips like some suggested.  I thought the dish turned out sort of bland and dry.  This is a good starter recipe and I may try it again but add onions, black olives and maybe reduce the amount of rice so that it would be a little more creamy.  All in all it's a good starter recipe that just needs to be tweaked with ingredients that you like.

This was great.  I did not use the mushroom because my wife does not like them and I added a cup of cheese to the top.  I think next time I will add corn and olives to add more veggies.

Really good comfort food. It's a good filler for tortillas, but I wouldn't eat this alone, it's a little too mushy in texture to eat alone. I only used a 1/2 jar of salsa and seasoned the dish with salt and pepper. Next time I will add some extra veggies; maybe bell peppers, corn, onions, and garlic. Oh, and also will try with black beans as suggested by many other reviewers. Thank you for this great easy recipe!

This is delicious.  I added chopped tomatoes, a can of black beans and 1/2 packet of taco seasoning, after worrying about the taste being a bit bland. It won over my husband! I served with blue chips and Hubby suggested that next time using this casserole as a filling for a flour tortilla for burrito style dinner!

This dish was pretty good.  I took some of the previous reviewers suggestions & doctored it some.  I added a can of petite cut tomatoes & a can of corn (both drained).  I wanted to make this quick so I bought 14oz of precooked chicken (I forget the brand).  I also used Uncle Bens' Spanish Rice.  This gave it quite a kick!  Wow!  I substituted light sour cream and fat free cheddar cheese.  I didn't notice any problems with those.  The only problem I had was that my 14 y/o son was adamant that he didn't like the mushrooms although I couldn't even tell they were in there!  I only used 8 oz of mushrooms (one large can), I think 2 cups would have been way too much.  We served this multiple ways: plain, with tortilla chips, or rolled up in a soft tortilla.  They all were great!  Oh, this was very filling too!  Enjoy!

We really liked this recipe.  I did add a bit of chopped jalapeno and some cumin, and topped it with the crushed tortilla chips which other reviewers recommended, but otherwise followed the recipe pretty closely.  It was a nice and easy, stick to your ribs supper.  Everyone liked it, and I'll definitely make it again.

Pretty good. I made the following changes, per the suggestions of others:

I added a can of black beans 
Topped the stuff with some chips and cheese

I used canned mushrooms and cooked the chicken before I baked it. 
I omitted the sour cream from the recipe and used it as a topping to put on afterward.

In the future:
Try adding a can of diced tomatoes as well as the beans.
Have olives and lettuce as toppings
Add some (or have on hand) hot sauce.

This is no casserole, it's either a nacho-topper or burrito-filler. Not too shabby in a burrito with some sliced avacado.

This was good-- makes a ton! For the cooked chicken, I sprinkled 2 boneless breasts with some onion powder, chili powder, salt and pepper and baked at 375 till done. I added about 1/2 chopped onion and some minced garlic to the pan with the mushrooms. I also added a can of rinsed black beans, frozen corn (thawed) to the chicken mixture and used brown rice. Served with flour tortillas. I think next time I will leave out the mushroom since I've made it into a Mexican dish. Thanks for sharing!

This was good, but needed more. It was basically the filling for a burrito, or enchilada. As such, it worked good wrapped up in a burrito.

I forgot to add in the mushrooms the first time I made the recipe.  When I added them the next time I thought they were good, but just as good without.  I served with sliced avocado on top as well as a squirt of lime juice.  I also added chopped cilantro.  Tastes like a light summery dish - Very yummy!

YUM and FULL of flavor! I did make some changes recommended by a friend who also made this recipe. I made it "healthy" by using Fat Free sour cream (which did NOT effect the taste negatively!) and low fat 4 Cheese Mexican Blend instead of Cheddar. I used brown rice cooked in chicken broth and omitted the mushrooms for onions and green peppers! To top it off I used blue corn chips! With the medium salsa it added a little spice (just a little spicy for the kids!) Overall, a great go to chicken dish that I will make again for sure!

I was looking for a quick meal with what I had on hand, and this was a good fit.  I altered the recipe slightly.  I used Perdue shortcuts roasted chicken in place of chicken breasts.  I also used prepared taco seasoning (from an envelope) because I did not have salsa on hand.  I added a small can of green chiles to add some zip and texture.  I then topped off with crushed tortilla chips and a little bit of cheese.  I don't think my substitutions altered the recipe much so next time I will make as stated because it is worth making again.

This was okay. My husband actually liked it but I thought the salsa flavoring was too overpowering and it didn't have enough depth to it. I would add a cup of cheese to the mix and sprinkle some on top before baking. I also agree with the user who says she puts chips on top, it really needs that extra crunch.

This really was oh-so-good!  My DH actually made it, and I'm convinced he followed his usual "little of this" and a "little of that" cooking method, but it still turned out amazing!  He used white rice (that wasn't even fully cooked), threw in some black beans and served it on tostatas topped with sour cream and tomatoes!  Yum!  Thanks for a great, impossible to mess-up, recipe!

This turned out a lot better than I thought it would. The only change I made was adding a can of chopped green chilis; used Southwest salsa and put in extra cheese.  Served on tortillas with sour cream, cheese, green onion and black olives. The flavor was even better the next day. My husband and guest both really liked it a lot. It's a keeper. Thanks!

At first I only rated this recipe a three. But after having a second serving and having my husband try it, I give it a five. My husband said it kind of reminded him of the stuff that goes in stuffed peppers. He's not a big fan of mushrooms, but thought the mushrooms tasted great in it. This is a keeper and I'll make it again.

I made this recipe exactly as written except I used 2 cups of leftover chicken instead of 8 oz. fresh. My husband and I both liked it very much. I'll make this again as I almost always have the ingredients on hand. It was easy to make and tasty. Couldn't ask for more. One writer said that it didn't look appealing, but I though it looked OK. It had a nice browned top.

This was pretty good.  I changed it up a bit to fit our meal plan.  I used two packages of the pre-packaged Southwestern chicken strips chopped up.  I used approx. 4 cups of cooked rice and added a can of corn and black beans to the mix.  I used (2) jars of 8 oz. smooth medium taco sauce from Ortega as my family doesn't like chunky salsa.  I omitted the sour cream from inside the casserole and we served this folded into flour tortillas with lettuce, sour cream, black olives, and refried beans. I would recommend trying this recipe!

A really good recipe and you can do so much with it like instead of chicken add taco meat or spread mixture on top of a Bobilli Pizza Crust and serve as a pizza, thank you for such a wonderful recipe. I will use again!

I put everything in that the recipe called for but also added more cheese, a small can of green chiles, beans & tortilla chips on top.  I served it over corn bread.  It was good...but even with those additions, it was a little on the bland side.  I think adding 1/2 can of jalapenos and maybe some chili or taco seasoning would do the trick!  The tortilla chips gave it a nice crunch.

This by itself is just okay. I doctored it up by adding some fresh garlic, cumin, salt & pepper, and also some corn & black beans. I served it with warm buttered tortillas and sliced avocado. All together it made for a yummy meal, but the dish by itself as-is is kinda plain.

I added corn and olives to the recipe. I also divided the salsa with half corn and black bean salsa and the other half black bean chipotle. It definitely could have used more salsa and more cheese.

I liked this recipe, but didn't love it. I thought the mushrooms didn't taste good in it. I would probably add corn to the recipe next time, too.

Great recipe. I did add some black beans, and taco seasoning, but followed the rest as written. My family loved it. Thanks for the recipe.

Definitely tastes better than it looks!  I sliced up an avacado on the plate as a garnish...it tasted great with the casserole and added some color to the dish.  I also added black olives and jalepenos.  My husband went back for seconds!

Very good and easy to make.  Added onions and garlic before cooking the mushrooms as well as canned tomatoes.  Very versitile, will keep changing it up.

Your recipe has been in my cookbook since June of 2006.  It tasted very good or I wouldn't have kept it.  I know that I've made this dish more than once and the only thing I've writen down is to add more chicken, more cheese and less rice.  Thanks for taking the time to share it with everyone.

This was wonderful! I made the following adjustments:  Used boneless chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts, added chopped green chiles, and topped the casserole with crumbled potato chips per other reviewers' suggestion.  Easy and satisfying.

My husband and I both liked this recipe, but we thought it might be missing "something." Next time I might use a bit hotter salsa and throw in some black beans. It is still very good :)

This was delicious- such good comfort food!  I used only 1 cup of salsa (half of a 16 oz jar) and a little more cheese than it called for because that's what I had left.  The mushrooms were so good in there- even more than 2 cups would have been good.  I will definitely keep making this!

Easy though I missed seeing that the chicken was pre-cooked until the last minute and quickly put it in the wok for a couple of minutes.  Black olives gives colour to an otherwise uniform coloured dish.  All I had was a very spicy salsa so I added a tablespoon of that and chopped up 2 tomatoes.  Because I am not such a meaty eater, next time I will add more mushrooms, and perhaps red peppers and less chicken.  My husband can eat the chicken. Even so, my husband, daughter and I all enjoyed it.

This was a big hit in my house and with friends. I doubled the recipe to have more for leftovers, but didn't change a thing except for using less rice. As I was mixing it in, it seemed to be too much, so I just left some on the side. DELICIOUS!! Making this again soon!

Was just ok.  My boyfriend said it may be good in a tortilla as a wrap.  I thought it had too much of a salsa taste.  Probably won't make again.

This casserole was very good. I made it with a 5.5 oz package of heat and serve rice (I used mushroom flavor) and it worked out perfectly and was very tasty.

I'd re-name this recipe "Pretty Good Chicken."  It was very easy to put together, but I won't make it again without serious modifications.  Not much flavor as it.  It's a good idea, but needs a little help.

Following the advice of others, I added a packet of taco seasoning and sprinkled tortilla chips on top. I also omitted the mushrooms. My husband loved it. It was very spicy.

I would actually give this 4.5 stars.  I got some raves but they all voted 4 stars because it wasn't so awesome as to give it 5 stars.  It's pretty easy to put it together.  One person suggested more cheese because she loves cheese!  I was going to try the suggestion of crumbling tortilla chips on top but I was out of time and I'm not sure how much I would like that one top of rice.  Overall thumbs up!

This has become a family favorite! I use shredded chicken (either breasts in the Insta-Pot or roasted chicken from the grocery store or Costco) but I think it would be just as tasty without the chicken. I do add black beans sometimes, just to bulk it up a little but it's not really necessary. We eat it straight or in tortillas or (most often) as a dip with tortilla chips.

I made this dish and just changed it a little. As other people have done I added black beans and my seasonings to chicken and added cheese to top along with cool ranch Doritos crushed and served with warm flour tortillas! They loved it!

Made it, left out the mushrooms and added some of our own spices. If your family is picky like mine I would suggest a smooth salsa vs a chunky one. But overall the dish was a hit, chicken was nice and juicy rice was flavorful

Loved this - as did the family.  A few changes based on the reviews stating it was bland. When cooking the chicken I added coriander, garlic salt and cumin and a touch of taco seasoning, some red onion and green chili’s .  To the dish I added a can of black beans and diced tomatoes.  To the top I melted some butter and added it to some crushed tortilla chips. All of this together was awesome.  Our family likes some spice so next time I will try to add more green chili’s and some chili powder for a kick.

I have made this twice now and used medium salsa. It is a bit spicy, but not too much and its lovely. I know that some people do substitutions, but I did it exactly as written and love it.

I didn't use mushrooms and added some cooked peppers and onion.   It was a hit with my whole family.   We ate it with tortilla chips!

We loved this recipe! I don’t care for mushrooms so I left those out, and I seasoned them chicken with taco seasoning; really glad I did that, it gave the dish a very nice flavor. Great recipe!

This is a very versatile dish.  You can go more Mexican and add black beans, corn, black olives -- or you can go Italian, and instead of salsa, use your favorite spaghetti sauce, basil, and parmesan cheese.  GREAT recipe!!  Thank you.

It was good. Used flavoured broccoli and cheddar rice and queso instead of salsa. Extra cheesiness.

I took out the mushrooms (and the olive oil, obviously), as I have two toddlers. It was good... nothing fancy, but nice to use up leftover chicken and rice from other things.

I added black beans, corn and black olives as others suggested, good idea. I actually liked these better than the mushrooms which didn't seem to fit with the Mexican style of the dish.  Flavors were good but I wasn't wowed.

This is delicious and a wonderfully forgiving recipe.  I am on a restricted diet and can't eat rice so I substitute quinoa - no problem.  Didn't have enough sour cream so substituted plain yoghourt - no problem.  It was delicious.  I did add extra chicken because I'm a meat lover - no problem.  The mushrooms added a delicious complexity of flavor.  Don't leave them out.  Delicious and easy.  What more can you ask for?!

HOLY SMOKES!!!!  This dish is wonderful!  I will be making this OVER and OVER and OVER again!  Be sure to read comments...this dish is extraordinarily adaptable.  I added corn (and won't be leaving it out ever again).  In lieu of plain sour cream, try adding the Hidden Valley FIESTA Ranch Dip packet to sour cream for a southwestern flavor.  Loved crumbling tortilla chips drizzled with butter for a crunchy topping.  I'll probably never make this dish the same way twice, but I know it will be great every time.

Five stars! This was absolutely delicious as written and was very easy to put together. It takes a 7 x 12 in. baking dish, which is not stated in the recipe.  Thank you for posting this recipe. It will be a 'go to' recipe of mine.

I followed this recipe pretty exactly as written. I didn't really measure sour cream or cheese, just finished what I had. I also used 2 bags of rice (I buy the boil in a bag rice). It turned out good, the only thing I would say about it is that it needed more flavor. Whether that is adding spices or using a different salsa (I used mild), I could have used some "umpf" to pump up the spice taste.

This recipe was great!  I made slight changes: I used more chicken and more shredded cheese. I also baked it for 45 minutes at 375  not 25-35 minutes at 350. In addition I used low-fat sour cream as well as 2% sharp cheddar.  The recipe is large enough for 6 people.  It was easy and quick to prepare!

We already had smoked/baked chicken thighs and a few cooked mushrooms on hand and was looking for a recipe to use them in.  
I put  cooked Zatarans black beans and rice (having read someone's  suggested use of black beans),  on the bottom of a casserole dish.  I then cut up the cooked chicken thighs, mixed in some sauteed onions, the smoked mushrooms, and sour cream.  I spread the mixture on top of the rice and covered to bake  45 minutes.  I then added shredded cheddar cheese, baked until  melted.  It was delicious!  Thanks everyone for your suggestions as you helped me develop the same dish with my own twists

I made this as per the instructions but grated some cheese on the top but when I opened the oven the cheese had melted but hadn't browned or crisped up so I turned the oven up intending to leave it for a further 10 minutes so the cheese could do it's thing but then forgot about it and only remembered an hour later, I opened the oven door expecting to find it burnt and ruined but it looked fine, as it cooled it set so  I cut it into squares and we had it cold with a simple green salad and it was lovely, would definitely make this again

Sorry but I'm not sure how this got such high marks!  I have never left a bad review on Allrecipes before, but this one deserved special treatment.  My daughter said it looked like vomit and it tasted like mushy salsa. I actually ended up eating it as a dip for my tortilla chips!  The rest is going in the trash.

Absolutely delicious!  The only minor tweak made was to use cooked brown rice instead of white rice. Served with warm corn tortillas, sliced avocado and a green salad.  Entire family had seconds and my daughter brought leftovers to work the next day.

It was really good.  I used one pan, my cast iron pot.  I also added fresh garden green beans and some red peppers.  Next time I'm going to try it with seafood and shrimp.

Easy & delicious. This could be used as a burrito filling. I used a mango salsa & it was too sweet. Best to stick with regular salsa.

This was a very easy and filling recipe.  We all enjoyed it and I will be making this again.  I did take the advice from another reviewer and cooked the diced chicken with taco seasoning. I do think it would have been very bland without it.  Next time, I would like to add black beans to the mix.  Thanks for a good dinner!!

I followed the recipe exactly.  If I made it again I would eliminate the mushrooms.  They just don't seem to fit into this dish for me.  I think I would add the rice on the side and mix the remaining ingredients separately then put the other ingredients in a tortilla shell.  Overall, it has a good taste but I would make it differently if I made it again.

I made this per the recipe instructions. My husband loved it, and I enjoyed it too. Oh, I did crush some potato chips on top. I doubled the recipe and put the second one in the freezer for another night. I'm sure we'll be making this again. It was quick and easy.

Takes some time to prepare because rice and chicken both have to be cooked before hand.  Use more cheese.

Made in March 2017. This will be a new favorite of mine! At time I made it, didn't have mushrooms or green onion, but think they would be great. I used up some fresh deli salsa; taste was great, but made it a bit watery. Will try the bottled salsa next time. I didn't have cheese, but did have sour cream. I think this recipe would be hard to beat! I used tips from two of our fellow cooks to put rice on bottom of casserole and then also to top it with crunched up tortilla chips. Yum! I really liked that. Baking time was spot on for me.

I took some reviewers suggestions and seasoned shredded chicken with taco seasoning and added black beans and corn. Absolutely delish. This will be a regular dish in our house!

This was very good!  I added 1 small can of drained diced green chilies and topped  it with additional grated cheddar and sliced black olives.  I served it with sour cream,  avocado slices and tortilla chips.  It would have been equally delicious if I had followed the recipe exactly.
I used Santa Barbara medium salsa.
I dislike reviews that rate a recipe after it has been modified so that it no longer resembles the original. 
I will look forward to serving this often!

Ooops!  Clicked 'I made it' twice.  Then again, it is likely that I will make it a second time, and third...we loved it and I can see the potential for personal modifications with black beans, Sazon arroz, black olives or broccoli florettes...or a gooey Mexican 4 cheese topping.  It's a hit, no doubt.

As another reviewer posted, this is basically a mexican version of chicken and rice casserole. Not bad, but just not worth the time to make, in my opinion. Plus, I felt the addition of the mushrooms was strange flavor; just didn't taste quite right in a mexican dish. I also, like other reviewers, added a can of black beans, a squirt of hot sauce, and a package of taco seasoning.

I made this for dinner tonight. I left out the oil and mushrooms. I used medium salsa and it was great. It was easy to put together. This  recipe is a keeper. I know I have a hit when my husband goes back for seconds.

I had low expectations for this and I was astonished how good it was. I traded pinto beans for the mushrooms. I would have used corn but I didn't have any. I had brown rice instead of white and I always use plain Greek yogurt for sour cream. Yum! The second time I made it I only had 8oz of salsa and it was fine. I even doubled the chicken. It was not dry at all, it was just right.

Very tasty as written, but I've made some changes which I think improve the dish greatly; I sub a can of Goya black beans, well rinsed, for the mushrooms, more authentically Latin and no need to sauré anything, making it even easier. I use Goya yellow Spanish rice (2 cups, cooked) instead of white. I recommend serving with chunky guacamole as a garnish, perhaps some sour cream. Then you'll have a 5 star casserole, and it couldn't be easier to make.

Left out the mushrooms, (not really a mushroom family here) added black beans. I didn't measure the cheese just threw in a handful (cheese family here). SOOOOOOO good. No leftovers. Mom approved, was able to make while holding a crying baby! (Don't worry baby stopped crying after being given a handful of the cooked chicken chunks before going into mix).

This was indeed oh so good!  I used only 3 tsp of oil and less cheese than the recipe calls for. I also used pre cooked rotisserie chicken breast from Costco.  I also took another reviewers suggestion and sprinkled some crushed tortilla chips on top. Easy and Delicious!  Next time will double the recipe so there are more leftovers!  Also will try low fat sour cream. Really a great recipe we will make often. Thank you so much!!!

I didn't really like the chicken in this dish. I think it would have been an amazing side dish or meatless meal, though. If I make it again, I'll leave out the chicken and add more mushrooms, maybe olives as well.

The only thing I changed was I substituted Greek Yogurt  instead of sour cream.  Less calories. 
I'll definitely  make it again.

We made this recipe exactly as instructed and it came out great. My salsa was HEAVY on black beans and corn and that was a plus. Next time I'm going to put in some corn and black beans and using a more traditional salsa. This recipe is definitely a keeper. We ate ours in tortillas with slices of avocado and a little sour cream.

This was sooooooo delicious!  I just finished eating 2 servings of this.  It is now my new "go to" meal.  I did use less salsa, and I did put in black beans--which I really liked.  I made it super lazy style--cooked chicken and mushrooms in cast iron pan-thru in salsa, cheese, sour cream...and after my boil in bag brown rice was done-just put it in a ring on the sides of the pan.  It looked pretty--you could dry out the rice a bit this way-but I got it in time.   could see making this with ground beef or turkey, or sliced beef--or it would be great with no meat at all and scooped up in tortilla chips.

Made this exactly as recipe called for. very tasty. Everyone liked it. The second time I substituted whole kernel corn. At my daughters request. Who does not care for mushrooms.  Actually liked it better. Gave it the texture that it needed. With the little bit of crunch. Will make this a lot.

loved it - just used 2 chx breasts (cut and cooked with butter and seasoning), 3/4 c rice, no mushrooms, 8oz salsa, topped with crumbled chips and drizzled the leftover butter/chx juice from the pan over the chips. i would add a little salt next time.

The first time we tried this recipe, DH made it.  Since we didn't have any mushrooms, he used broccoli.  It was very good, but it was PINK!   I made it again last week, as the recipe is. I cooked the chicken, mushrooms and salsa together.  Then I added the shredded cheese off the heat.  What I did differently was to layer the ingredients to avoid the overall pink color. I layered the rice in a sprayed casserole dish, then I layered the chicken mix over it, covered the chicken with the sour cream and more shredded cheese on top.  I uncovered the casserole after 25 min. and let the cheese brown up a bit for another 5 minutes.  Delicious!  Thank you for such a savory recipe.
PS:  The leftovers are great in a tortilla wrap too.

We didn't like this dish at all and I will never make it again. I found the flavours did not go together at all and it was just a pile on the plate.  Sorry, just didn't like it.

I tried this as it was rated very high.  I know everyone has different tastes, but to me this was just ok.  Even adding black beans, taco seasoning, and crushed chips on top as many suggested didn't make a great dish.  Mushy rice texture and little bits of chicken, not my ideal recipe for chicken.

I think it needs some jalapenos to liven it up.

I made this recipe because I had an abundance of mushrooms and chicken.  I do not eat mushrooms.  My husband said he liked but I could tell he wasn't crazy about it.

I made this without the mushrooms as not a big fan of the overpowering taste of them. This recipe was great! I used a medium hot salsa, restaurant style so no big chunks which I like better.

This is quite tasty and convenient!  Kind of a baked Arroz Con Pollo.  It can be put together in advance, so it's great for busy evenings.  I like the flavor, but feel like it needs some added punch to take it from "good" to "wonderful".

I personally wouldn't make it again. Everyone else rated it a 6-7 on a scale of 1 to 10 where 10 is best ever. They ate dinner, then put the filling in a tortilla, and had burritos. The teens said it made a fab burrito filling.

This dish was extremely, extremely bland.  I followed the recipe, the only thing I did different was to add some black beans. Just seemed to have no flavor. UPDATE.  When you eat this put more cheese and sour cream on each serving, not that bad when you do that.

Great and easy to make healthier. Hubby hate mushrooms, so I omitted and added black beans and a chopped green pepper that I sauted with green onions (per another suggestion). Added a little taco sauce. Made with brown rice too, can't even tell the difference. May add corn next time. Served on cooked tortillas, just delicious.

This is a delicious easy weeknight recipe with ingredients I had on hand when I decided to make it at 4pm!   Here are the few changes I made:

(1) I cubed the chicken and sauteed it in olive oil and sprinkled a little bit of onion powder and homemade taco seasoning I  made from from  Allrecipes. 

(2) While the rice was cooking in the rice cooker, I poured half the salsa into the pan with the chicken and let it simmer until the rice was done. I used "medium" flavored cantina style salsa from Harris Teeter which had just enough heat and flavor. It was perfect.

(3) Once the rice was done cooking, I poured it into the pan with the chicken and stirred in the rest of the salsa, all of the cheddar cheese  and 4 TBSP of sour cream. I then baked as recommended. Left out the mushrooms because no one in my family likes them except me.

The recipe was a hit with everyone and next time we are going to use the casserole as a filling for burritos.   This is definitely going on the rotation!

This was awesome! Used red peppers instead of mushrooms. Also used brown rice instead of white rice. You definitely do not need 6 tablespoons of sour cream! Wayyyy too much. I used 6 oz only and it was perfect!

It tasted really heavy on the sour cream.  Even my husband who loves sour cream said it had an over powering taste.  Just not very good.  Will not be making again.

Good recipe!  The family enjoyed it.  I added French's dried onion rings (buy in a small plastic container on store shelf) in the casserole and then on top for the last 10 min.

Awesome, I used 1 pound ground pork and 1 pound of ground chuck. Very solid. i made the loaves in 2 small pans with one being a foil pan, so it was easy to freeze it for a later date.  I got 4 servings out of each loaf.

I cooked the chicken and mushrooms in an oven proof skillet adding fresh onions and garlic. Then I just added the other ingredients and baked it in there. I used brown rice and plain Greek yogurt to make it more healthful. Next time I might add some type of fresh pepper, too, and sub quinoa for the rice.

Loved it- I also changed a few things due to ingredients on hand- I used rotisserie chicken, Zucchini instead of mushrooms & wild rice- and it was great. I want to try it their way too- bet it would be good with Ground beef also.

This recipe is delicious!  I cooked the chicken with salt, pepper, chili powder, minced onion and garlic powder, and then I added chopped onion before I put it in the oven so it was a little crispy - one of my new favorites!!

One of my husband's favorites.  I make two pans, one for me without salsa using tomatoes because I can't eat the peppers or onions and one for hubby with the salsa.  I divide it up into containers for lunches and it works very well.  Lately, I have started adding black beans and corn sometimes and that is good also.  My original recipe for this called for corn chips to dip it with but we decided we didn't really need the extra calories.

This is great with, and without the chicken. Sometimes I make this as a main dish, sometimes a side, and sometimes as a mexican tortilla filler! Great Job!

My family loved this, my 2 toddler girls cleaned their plates.  I did cook the chicken in taco seasoning and added a can of black beans, next time will add a can of green chiles as well.  Will definitely make again!

Really good recipe, but I would change the title to chicken and rice as there's just as much rice as there's chicken. This one is definitely a keeper!

Turned out pretty well. I used 2 potatoes and boca burger instead of the chicken. I also used brown rice instead of white. The casserole turned out well.

This is oh so good. I liked this and I think it will be good tomorrow for lunch wrapped inside a tortilla with a little more salsa. I read some of the reviews that said to use less salsa, so I just added little by little until it looked right to me, ended up being about half a jar of chi chis salsa. I chopped up b/s chix breast and sauteed with the seasoning mix from quesadilla burgers from this site with some red onion and the sliced mushrooms. Turned out really good, I think I would make this again! Thanks.

Excellent recipe.  We didn't saute the mushrooms.  We used light sour cream and used a little more of it than the recipe.  Quaker Oats Guacamole Tortilla Chips crumbled on top.  Paul Newman Peach Salsa.  The flavors came together magically.  This is an instant favorite.

This is a great recipe for a quick, weeknight meal.  It has plenty of flavour so I found no need to add any more seasoning.  The only alterations I made was I used a cheddar mix and I added a couple of handfuls of black olives to enhance the appearance of the dish. Definitely will make this again.

This was really just okay. It's good, but I think adding mushrooms to chicken helper would taste just like this, if not better. I will try putting it in tortillas today, and see if its better as a leftover.

This was an okay recipe; I liked how quickly it came together but it was very salty and almost rich... I think that if I were to make something like this again, I would omit the mushrooms (I LOVE mushrooms but they really didn't fit in this dish) and use it as a filling for soft tortilla wrappers or something.

I am doing the weight watchers core plan and this dish was easily adapted to fit that plan. I used fat free sour cream, fat free cream cheese, and brown rice instead of white rice. While it's probably tastier with the original ingredients, this totally satisfied my craving for a casserole. Two thumbs up!!

I used pasta instead of rice as well and it turned out nicely. I would agree with others that you can add other ingredients like olives, onions, tomatoes, etc. My husband loved this!

This recipe was good (I wouldn't say it is oh-so-good, just good).  I followed the recipe, with the only change being that I doubled the amount of chicken.  I choose this recipe because of the mushrooms, and that was my husband's favorite part.

We all loved this recipe. I didn't add the mushrooms (I didn't have any). I also didn't use as much salsa as some recommended, but wish I would have. I also used yellow rice and a little chili powder and cumin for extra flavor. It was great, I could probably eat everyday! Maybe use some fat free sour cream and 2% cheese to make it healthier. Thanks for the great recipe!

It was good, I followed other reviewers, less salsa and crushed tortilla chips over top!  I think I used too hot of a salsa though!!!  Boys ate every last drop, thanks for the recipe.

This was good...but not "oh so good".  I'm like other reviewers and think this is more of a filling to use with tortillas.  And my husband said this would be a perfect dish to take to a potluck where this wouldn't be considered a main meal.

Made as a casserole but used as a dip.  Great for a dip.  Mine was a little bland, so I am thinking that maybe using a spicer sausa would help.  Great with extra cheese on top.

Ohhhh,man. So good. When I went to use the salsa I found that my husband had eaten a bunch of it, so I only had ~ 1/2 cup! I added 1/2 tomato sauce and a few dashes hot sauce to make up for it, but I still didn't have 16 oz. I also added a can of black beans for more protein and fiber. My kids loved it!

This recipe is easy to prepare and delicious! However I did make some changes as there was very little salsa left. I added diced tomatoes & tomato sauce and salt to taste. I also did not  mix the rice and cheese to the sauce. Instead, I put rice into the greased casserole, topped with the sauce and sprinkle the chedder cheese on top. Baked in pre-heated oven at 375F for 15min, till cheese melts and bubbly. My husband asked for this to be made again at least once every fortnight!

This recipe turned out great! Will make again.  I didn't have any fresh mushrooms so I used some that was in a can and they worked just fine.  I also added a extra spoon of sour cream on top of each serving.

This was really good. I used already cooked fajita spiced cooked chicken and when the rice was done, I added it to the sauted mushrooms for about 10 minutes. GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!

This was really good.  I used saffron seasoned rice and that worked well.  The name is a little deceiving, though.  We couldn't think of a better one, but the chicken isn't the star of this dish.

Okay - couple of things; you need like a pound of cheese to really hold it all together and for the salsa not to overpower the dish.  I am thankful for the member who recommended the crushed tortilla topping - that added to the presentation of the dish - which I am sorry to say - is quite lacking.  My kids were so so on it and even though it was a reasonable dinner; I do not think I will make it again....also Spanish olives would have enhanced the experience...

This recipe didn't have enough flavor.  I would recommend sauteing the mushrooms with garlic and adding seasoning to the chicken before cooking.  Too bland for our taste.

Delicious and easy!!! The only thing I changed was to use a little more sour cream and also topped the casserole w/ a little more cheese before baking. Tasted much better than I expected it would and was the perfect way to use up leftover chicken. Yum!

Lots of room for personalization, but excellent as written. Used medium salsa. Nice and filling! Served with corn chips.

This recipe was delicious!  I substituted canned mushrooms because that is what I had in the house. I also added jalapenos to the top because my boyfriend and I are huge fans of extra heat. This is now one of my boyfriend's favorite meals!

This was really fantastic!  I tend to like a lot of spice and cheese, so I used extra-spicy salsa and extra cheese.  The first time I made it, I also put jalapeno-flavored potato chips on top before baking and it made a tasty crust. This was really great as left-overs as well. I also like to wrap some of this in a tortilla and make a burrito. Very tasty!
