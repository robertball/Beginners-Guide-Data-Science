These potatoes are fantastic! Since I was preparing a large meal I got a head start on these early in the day by cutting the potatoes and soaking them in water. This will firstly prevent them from discoloration but will also rid the potatoes of excess starch so they roast up crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. To save my sanity cleaning the baking sheet, I first placed a layer of parchment paper down - cleanup's a snap. The best part of these potatoes was by far the parmesan. The potatoes were evenly coated and melted during roasting to form a crunchy, flavorful crust. My kids loved these! Definitely a keeper. Thanks for the recipe!!

Excellent side dish! I used red skinned potatoes and added a bit of rosemary to the mix as it pairs well with thyme. I did bake this at 425 and tossed them once during cooking. They took about 45-50 minutes. They came out crispy and delicious - perfect with grilled steak!

Oh my! These were awesome! I eliminated the thyme (just personal preference) and added garlic (another personal preference) The parmesan cheese is what makes them amazing! Thanks for the great recipe!

These are great!! I chopped up one big potato and it was just enough for me and my husband. He actually thought they were something that I had bought. He didn't realize I had made them! I added rosemary just for personal preference. I will make this dish again!

A good and reliable roasted parmesan potato recipe, and there are a million of ‘em.  I chose to roast mine at 425 degrees and, because I wanted them super golden brown, didn’t turn them half way through the cooking time as would generally be recommended.  Half an hour for teeny, little new potatoes, cut in half, was just right.  Also, just as a matter of personal preference, I used fresh rosemary rather than thyme, tho’ any herb or your spice of preference would work.

My kids love the parmesan in this - I've made this several times and it's great.  Just make sure you use plenty of non-stick spray.

If you're using regular table salt, cut the amount in half.  Kosher salt measurements are half the sodium of regular salt.

Wow!!! made this last night on the barbeques. All I had on hand was mini potatoes, so I cut those in half tossed them in the oil mixture added some rosemary as suggested by others too. I sprayed barbeque foil with Pam, dumped the potatoes on then sprinkled the Parmesan over top!! Cooked on indirect heat for 1 hour. DELISH!

Very good potatoes. I left out the thyme. I also tossed them halfway through cooking so all sides would get crispy.

Delicious!  I used RED potatoes, and tossed in 1 tablespoon of garlic powder and 1 tablespoon of onion powder in the bowl with the olive oil, salt & pepper (no thyme).  Only took 25-30 minutes at 400 degrees (never turned 'em).  Made this three times to compliment different style of eggs (scrambled, boiled, etc.)..came out beautifully every time.  Thank you Kristen!

These were quick, easy and tasty. I served with baked boneless skinless chicken breasts and steamed broccoli and a decent white wine. They were a lovely bit of decadence in a very healthy meal.

This is an awesome, easy recipe.  Use freshly grated Parmesan.  It's worth the extra effort.  My son is not a picky eater but this is one recipe that he requests over and over. Great with a good steak.

I added some garlic but otherwise followed the recipe as written- to quote the recipe submitter, this is a delicious, easy side dish!  I usually cut potatoes into wedges when I make seasoned, oven roasted potatoes, but I cut into 1" discs and they had a great texture.  This is a "repeat" recipe for sure :)

This recipe was just okay for us. I was all excited because as I was mixing the dish up the combination of the parmesan and the thyme smelled wonderful, and it smelled heavenly when I was taking it out of the oven. But the taste simply wasn't as good as the smell unfortunately. The good thing about this recipe was that my two oldest boys ate it pretty good so they seemed to like it. The potatoes just tasted a little bland to me, but maybe changing the grated cheese to shredded and maybe a couple more spices might give it the taste that it was lacking. I might have to try that! Again, this was not a bad dish, just not real exciting to eat. Thanks for the recipe, Kristen!

We love these potatoes! They are easy to make and good enough to serve to company. We find them a little too salty as originally written, so I recommend cutting back the salt by half. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

These were great!  I used a 2 lb bag of mixed mini potatoes, sliced them and roasted them.  So easy and so wonderful.  Personal taste: used rubbed rosemary, garlic and some Italian seasoning.

I loved these! They turned out a lot better than I expected, I just put them on a cookie sheet lined with tin foil and they turned out great! The Parmesan really adds flavor, and I added garlic salt. Next time I may even add minced garlic. Would definitely recommend!

These were very good & easy. I cooked them for a little over an hour I believe. Next time I think I will cut them smaller, I liked the little pieces of potato, they were a bit crispier.

This was perfect and exactly what I was looking for. My husband is an extremely picky eater and loved these, asking if we could add them into the dinner rotation on a regular basis. I did add just a bit of rosemary, but I'm sure they would have been amazing without. Thanks for a great recipe, Kristen!

I followed VRcook's advice and soaked the sliced potatoes earlier in the day. I prepared the recipe as directed and added 1/8 t rosemary and a shake of garlic powder. I also baked with foil for 50 minutes, without foil for 10 minutes, then broiled for a couple minutes to crisp the top. The potatoes baked up perfectly. Flavor was full and savory -- perfect blend of parmesan and herbs. My family devoured them!

I loved this recipe!  I did add garlic powder (to taste about 1/4 to 1/2 tsp.) and substituted pecorino romano cheese because I didn't have parmesan.  My very "picky" husband loved the potatoes as well.  It was easy and tasty!

Made this last night and just loved it. Will try with other herbs too. Totally simple and since I cut the potatoes a bit thinner, took only 40 minutes in the oven. Definitely adding this to my repertoire! I left out the salt, the Parmesan seemed salty enough. Great recipe.

I made these to go with Baby Back Ribs and they were so easy.  I cut the red potatoes in chunks and put everything into a plastic zip lock bag to coat them.  Then I dumped it all in a baking dish which was sprayed and then some oil in the bottom.  They baked at 400F. for  about 40 minutes and they were delicious.  Thanks, Kristen, for another great recipe.

Awesome! We added a tablespoon of crushed garlic per our preference but still would have been great without it. Cut the potatoes into about 1/8 in slices instead of chunks to help cook more evenly. Very flavorful and went very well with our chicken dish (Chicken Crunch from this website if you are looking). Didn't have thyme so just used and italian seasoning blend instead. Will definitely be making this on again!

Tried this exactly as written other than using Lite Salt. I used red potatoes. Made it for the first time for guests and we all enjoyed it greatly. As some reviewers suggested, I did lightly spray the parchment paper with Pam and had no problem with them sticking at the time I turned them or when I removed them to the serving dish.

Very good and very easy.  I didn't bother mixing in a bowl but mixed in the pan I popped in the oven and it worked perfectly.  Cut way down on the salt and pepper since that's something that is easy enough to adjust up but so hard to adjust down.  I like the ease and the flavor of this.  Hardest part is chopping potatoes!  Thanks for the recipe!

Finally made this recipe--I shouldn't have waited so long to try it!! These potatoes are beyond fantastic!!!  I could have made a whole meal of them....savory, flavorful,just delicious. I used 6 large baking potatoes to about double the recipe because I wanted some leftovers--well, there weren't any!!  I sliced the potatoes in thick slices rather than chunk them, and I didn't double the other ingredients--only increased the parmesan to 3/4 cup.  (I think for me it would have been too oily and too much salt if I had doubled everything) I did sprinkle some cheese over the top before I baked them in a roasting pan lined with heavy duty foil at 425 degrees, and it browned wonderfully, with crispy edges to the potatoes.  Next time I'm going to have to quadruple it because everyone just went gaga over them. FIVE BIG STARS!!!

Good potatoes though they seemed a little heavy on the Parmesan cheese.  I halved the thyme and added a couple tablespoons of minced garlic.

I needed an alternative to mashed potatoes since the husband found out that he's allergic to dairy, so I left off the Parmesan. Made them the very first time for some company, and they were a big hit.
I changed the salt for garlic salt and cut it down to a couple dashes. I did cut and soak the potatoes ahead of time per someone else's review. Mine stuck to the baking sheet even though I turned then halfway through, but they were still very good.

I used this as a base for baked potato salad. Very simple and really made my potato salad shine. NOTE: I did use two full pounds of potatoes and added just a little more of the spices.

I cut 2 potatoes into slices and baked them 47 minutes, which was too long. They tasted similar to potato chips. I didn't use thyme, but I followed every other step. These were good. Next time, I'll further decrease the bake time.

My husband made this and our extremely food picky roommate kept snitching them - saying he'd only have  few until about half were gone. We are looking forward to making this dish again. We quartered small red potatoes and had only ground thyme. My husband used cracked sea salt and some garlic powder.

Delicious! I cut the potatoes in 1/4 inch slices (as shown in a photo) and spread on a cookie sheet. Reserved 2 T of parm cheese to sprinkle over the top. No need to flip them. They crisped up great. If you cut them too thin, they will burn.

Hubby and I Iove this!!  The only change I would make is to cut down on the salt.  We've also made it using rosemary as a seasoning for a change-up, and it was delicious too.  Such an easy and satisfying dish!!!

Delicious side dish! Everyone took seconds and we will make this again. Lots of flavor using ingredients that we had on-hand.

Very good and so easy! Also, if you slice them a bit thinner you can bake for less time.

These are outstanding! I added more spices- rosemary and parsley- but the best additional ingredient was crushed red pepper flakes which I add to most roasted or stovetop chunky potatoes. It just kicks them up a notch. Thanks for a yummy and easy recipe. I usually also make the Parmesan roasted asparagus recipe from this site as they both cook at 400 degrees.

These were okay. I think I might have liked them a little better with some garlic, maybe. I'll probably make them again, but I'm really looking for a more savory roasted potato. But, these will work till I come up with the right blend, I'm looking for. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Delicious and easy.  I used less salt as other reviews suggested.  I used garlic powder and parsley flakes. No thyme.

These were really good! I used small red potatoes and halved the recipe, since I was making it for just my husband and me.  I also used shredded parmesan rather than grated. He really enjoyed it and wants to have them again soon. Next time I will cut the salt down to 1/4 teaspoon because it was just a little too much salt for us. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

The first time I prepared this exactly according to the recipe but I found it very bland tasteless.  I tried a second time with more seasoning and also added some rosemary and it still ran flat with my family.  Will not try again.

I just made this for supper, and it was delicious! I had a fresh Parmesan mix on hand, so I used that instead of just Parmesan. I wasn't sure about the thyme but I put about two dashes and it was delicious and subtle. I chopped my potato very small so it only took about 40 mins to cook. I am a huge fan of oven roasted potatoes and didn't think they could be improved upon, but this recipe is a keeper! Thanks! :)

This recipe was a hit! I was making another thing using the oven at 350, so I ran the potatoes at 350 for an hour and they came out fine. I tossed them with the grated parmesan, but I also sprinkled the top with shredded parmesan to make them extra cheesy. I didn't have kosher salt, but table salt worked just fine.

Just lovely. I used fresh thyme, which worked very well. I also placed them on baking paper, little cleanup and no problem cooking them on it. I might try a bit of rosemary next time also...or some mixed herbs...you could tweak this one many way. It's a winner!:)

I followed the recipe but must have done something wrong, the potatoes stuck to the pan terribly and I had used a bit of spray. When i tried to take them out of the pan they were so stuck to the pan that the potatoes broke up and became bits. If anyone has any suggestions about what could have gone wrong I would appreciate hearing them

I made this dish for a football party. Everyone LOVED it and I loved it because I was able to make the dish and clean up the dishes prior to kickoff. All I had to then do was stick it into the oven and I didn't miss a single play! Highly recommend it.

Great, Easy Sidedish.  I used baby Yukon Gold Potatoes unpeeled.  I added 1/2 teaspoon of dried rosemary and upped the thyme to 1/2 teaspoon too.  I cut each baby potatoe into six wedges and placed them on parchment paper on a baking sheet.  They cooked in 30 minutes at 400 degrees (flipped after 15 minutes) and cleanup was a snap with just tossing the parchment paper.  This recipe is much better than any fried potatoes I have had.  Served with sour cream and they were a welcome change from ketchup.

These were good but I found them to be a little dry. I added a little extra olive oil after they were done baking.
