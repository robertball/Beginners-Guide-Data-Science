I made the recipe mostly as written, only a few changes made.. one, I increased the amount of Strawberry Margarita mix and decreased the amount of water, just by a little bit. I disagree that a boxed strawberry cake mix would be the same, or easier.  For one thing, I could not find a strawberry cake mix when I shopped.  And the margarita mix adds just that slight bit of tangy flavor that makes it taste, well, margarita-ish.  The only other change I made was to add fresh halved strawberries on top.  Oh, and I tossed the lime zest with a tiny tiny bit of sugar.  The cake was a hit.

The cake part tasted like a strawberry cake from a boxed cake mix.  I would suggest just making a boxed strawberry cake mix and save the expense of the strawberry margarita drink mix.  However, the
whipped topping spread on top and sprinkled with fresh lime zest was very attractive and perfect for summertime!  Looked impressive and tasted very refreshing and wonderful!

LOVED the idea of a margarita cake, i did a little changes, i made a double layer 9in round cake, and used 3/4 of the can of margarita mix for the cake mix. the remainder of the margarita mix was whipped with the cool whip, and placed between the layers with a layer of fresh strawberries as well. the remainder of the cake was topped with cool whip, the sides fresh strawberries, and the top was the lime zest that was tossed in sugar. BEAUTIFUL cake that tasted GREAT!!! LADIES NIGHT loved it!!

I first made this for Father's Day (2002) and got rave reviews.  I just made it last night for my monthly dinner group-more rave reviews!  It's very light and moist - perfect after a "heavy" winter meal!  I put strawberries cut in half on top of the frosting then cover with the zest.  I promised to make this more often - my husband wants to take one to his office!

I use applesauce instead of oil and this makes the cake very moist.  This cake is requested often and I never have any leftovers!!

Sorry...did not care for this cake. The flavor of the Strawberry Margarita mix just was not great with the cake. And the cake mix was not altered enough to not TASTE like a boxed mix. The coolwhip as a frosting didn't go well either. Won't be making this one again. If I get the urge for a Strawberry-Lime type cake, I'll make a real Strawberry layer cake and put lime curd between the layers.

I made this cake for my office Christmas party and it was by far the most talked about dessert there. I followed the directions precisely as stated and could not believe how moist and tasty that it was. All my female co-workers could not belive that I made it myself. It is definitely one that will be used again and again.....

this recipe is AWESOME! i went with cupcakes since i love them and it's so fun to decorate them.
i made them for a small cinco de mayo get together this year and they were a giant hit!
i followed the directions listed, and used a few of the suggestions that other folks through out there like mixed the lime zest with sugar and adding lime juice to the batter (i did the juice from half a large lime and would like to use more next time). I also added fresh strawberry slices to top my cupcakes off. :) The sugared lime zest and fresh strawberries really make this recipe!

I would give this 3.5 stars actually.  I did not go the whipped topping route for the frosting, I made a lime buttercream that was a really good compliment, and made cupcakes.  The recipe was easy and got really good reviews from others, my reason for only 3.5 stars instead of 4 or a full 5 is because I would have preferred a more pronounced strawberry & lime flavor to the actual cake itself.  It was good, but didn't pack as much flavor as I had hoped for.  Also, the cupcakes were a tad dry/crumbly, which I think may have been because of the use of egg whites and not the whole eggs, but then again, at the time I made these I was still getting use to using a new oven - convection at that, which was totally new to me, so that could have been my issue and not the cake, so I won't count off for that.

I used the suggestions to add lime juice to the mix, 1/4 cup of water, 1 cup of margarita mix. Then for the frosting I added the margarita mix to the cool whip, and a dash of lime. I grated the lime, added it to large decorating sugar and squeezed a bit of lime juice in to flavor it. I made cupcakes so I actually "lined" the edge of the cupcake like a margarita glass. Very moist, and delicious!

This is a wonderfully refreshing cake to serve in the middle of a HOT summer.  Brought it to work for a pot-luck and it was gone in less than 5 minutes (no kidding).  Not only did it get RAVE reviews from all who ate it, but I shared the recipe with at least 6 other people who also claim it to be one of the best cakes they've ever had.  Thanks for sharing!!

The most common statement is that this cake tastes like BOXED Strawberry Cake.... YES, it does but WITHOUT the "artificial" after taste.  It is still very good!  I followed the recipe EXACTLY for the cake, and used my own "Lime Zest" frosting instead of whipped cream and it turned out wonderful!

So yummy and moist.  Was not a crumb left!!  I don't know how it compares to strawberry cake mix, but this was certainly delish!  I used Strawberry-Lime Margarita.  I didnt have whipped topping so I used a cream cheese frosting with Lime zest.  Then just before serving, I topped it with a strawberry w/sugary juice.  Yum Yum!!

Made this cake for my sister's bridal shower in August, it was a huge hit. Now, I made it into cupcakes for my church group - bake for 15 mins at 350 and used lime jello mixed into the cool whip for the frosting with sliced strawberries on top - super yummy!!

I've made this several times - as a sheet cake. It's easy and delicious! I like to add sliced frozen strawberries (thawed) on top of the cool whip. Yummy! Always gets lots of compliments.

Very great cake! I made this for Memorial day and everyone loved it. I added some extra margarita mix and used some limes along with strawberries to decorate it (see photos). I will be making this again.

I made this recipe last night only with regular non-alcoholic margarita mix rather than strawbery. I found the recipe through Betty Crocker website and it was the exact same recipe and is very light and fresh. My Euchre Card club  loved it! If you are looking for  sweet/salty flavors, this is it - not heavy and rich like so many desserts can be!

This cake was simple to make, refreshing, and an overall hit at the Cinqo de Mayo party to which I brought it.  Personally, I believed it could have been a bit less sweet and had a less "boxed" taste. I garnished with fresh stawberries.

Great! I made this for a potluck at work that was Mexican food theme. It was a huge hit! Everyone loved it and wants the recipe! Was easy to make, but found that I had to bake it a little longer than called for in the recipe.

I used strawberry daquari mix because we didn't have the margarita mix on hand. I also made my own topping with whipping cream, powdered sugar, lime zest, and juice (i don't like the packaged taste of whipped topping) was Awesome and tangy. Was great considering it all started with a boxed cake mix! refreshing!

Too sweet!  However, my young son and our friends loved it...thus the 4 stars.  If I would make this again, I would not use a box cake mix but rather a "scratch" recipe so I could control the sweetness.

Made this recipe for a Cinco de Mayo luncheon, and it was extremely well received. People appreciated the fact that it was "different," and not in a negative way.  It was extremely easy to prepare and serve as well.

This was really delicious; however, I forgot about the lime zest.  Next time, I will use strawberry Cool Whip and add fresh strawberries on top.

really bland; just a strawberry cake mix with a bit of different flavor liquid thrown in, but not enough to make a difference. Don't waste your time on this one.

I like this recipe, however, I had a problem with the whipped topping. It was messy and didn't stick that well. I would recommend it but I would love to hear some other ideas about the topping.  Lime Zest was great! It makes it!!!

Great cake, I agree a strawberry cake mix would probably be just as good.  On the other hand, use the leftover strawberry margarita mix and make some margaritas, might as well.  I had several requests for this recipe and will make it again.  Easy and delicious.
