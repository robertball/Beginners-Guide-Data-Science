Great recipe! I thickened it a bit more with some cornstarch used ground red pepper instead of cayenne. My husband loved it and has requested we have it again!!!

Used Buddig beef instead and chopped it. Flavor was ok. Tasted too much sour cream. My guests really liked it though!

It has great potential but lacked flavor. I'm going to try some modifications to the recipe

I made this and another chipped beef dip tonight and this one was by far the better and most flavorful. I'm not a big on ranch flavor but it works great with this. The one thing the other dip had that I thought would have been good in this was black olives. I served this on Valentines Day in 'tulips" made out of tomatoes and the crackers were on the side. Great recipe!

Followed the recipe and didn't care for it at all.It may have been ok if the sour cream was cut in half of less.To thin and gets watery as it sits overnight.Probably my fault for not looking around I was looking for that good tasting chipped beef cream cheese dip that I have had at so many places in my life.If thats what your looking for this isn't it.
