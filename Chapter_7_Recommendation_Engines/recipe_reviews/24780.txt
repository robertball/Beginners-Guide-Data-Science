This receipe has a lot of potential. I took everyone's suggestions and added a few things in myself to make this recipe pretty good.

Here's how to make this recipe good:
-Substitute cream cheese for whipped topping.
-Melt cream cheese together with 1/2 c. sharp white cheddar and 1/2 c. mild yellow cheese. Add this melted mixture to the other ingredients after they are mixed.
-Stick to the cream of mushroom.
-Add a diced onion that has been cooked a little (I boiled it with my chicken strips to make both really tender).
-Lots of salt, pepper and milk.
-It could stand to bake for less time.
-I added parmesean and breadcrumbs to the top before baking.

I hope these suggestions help!

This recipe was okay; however, I would ommit the whipped topping.  It gave it a very odd flavor that just got sickining after a while.  Someone asked what that flavor was and I told them the whipped topping and they were quite surprised that I put whipped topping in a chicken casserole.  I would use cream of chicken instead of mushroom unless you're really crazy about the cream of mushroom flavor.  Also, a package of frozen peas with carrot would really brighten this up.  Also, I cubed my chicken for easy bites.
Good recipe ideal, but just needed some fine tuning.

This was just so-so.  We did not care for the cool whip flavor in it. I make a chicken and noodles and tuna and noodles identical to this without the whipped topping and we like that much better. I thought the kids would enjoy eating whipped cream in their dinner but boy was I wrong.

My husband and daughter really liked this dish, so I am giving this 4 stars. I personally think it deserves a three. This recipe has potential. I did not make it as written, I used cream cheese instead of cool whip. I am sorry, but cool whip just doesn't belong in a chicken dish... That is what unsweetened whipped cream is for. I thought the spinach was a nice addition. I will make it again, but with several changes. I definitely would not just glom it all together in the pot! It may be easy but the globs of velveeta were kinda gross. You are supposed to make the cheese sauce seperately, then add to the casserole. This recipe needs work in order to make it into my normal cooking rotation...

Not bad, but I think it needed more vegetables in it to give it more of a flavor.  I added some chopped onion, celery, and mushrooms because that's what I had around at the time.  I think some chopped carrots and corn might be nice next time too.  I also omitted the whipped cream because I didn't have any on hand and added 1/4 cup mircle whip instead.  I also put in a handful of cheddar cheese and omitted the Parmasan cheese for the topping and added more cheddar.  Served it with some corn bread and it was pretty good.

This was yummy!I omitted the whipped topping(I was afraid it would be too sweet)and also the american cheese(not a big fan of it)and it came out great!I doubled the grated parm.I topped it with breadcrumbs and put it under the broiler for 5 minutes. I would make this again.

My husband and I thought this was excellent!  We did change it a bit, I used whipping cream instead of coolwhip and cheddar cheese instead of the processed cheese.  We also used spinach which was excellent! A great way to use up the leftover chicken from the other day too.  We will make again

I HAD to try this recipe. I'm drawn to the ones that have that single weird ingredient that makes you wonder what it would be like. Most of the time they turn out wonderfully and you can tell your friends about your great new discovery. Unfortunately, this isn't one of them. I very rarely give poor reviews because I know people have different tastes but this was just so very....odd. The blending of the soup and this topping was just wrong. It tasted like sweet mushroom soup and started making us nauseous just because the texture and taste weren't adding up! Different, and not in a good way. Sorry.

really really good! My kids hate cassaroles as a rule but they loved this. Like many others I changed the whipped topping & added 1/2 cup mayo & 1/2 cup sour cream instead. Also, I added a package of stuffing mix (made up) as a topping.Made Sept 09

Make it how it calls. When you change it it is not the same recipe. I made this for a church pot luck and everyone loved it. Was unsure about cool whip but it would not be the same without it. It was a simple comfort food type of meal. I left the peas out and did veggies on the side. My kids asked me to cook again two days later. Will be a potluck favorite!

I made this with some variations and loved it.  I used cream cheese instead of the whipped topping, used cheddar cheese instead of american and put spinach in instead of green peas.  I also used rosemary and thyme when cooking the chicken and in seasoning the casserole.

I omitted the whipped topping, and used heavy whipping cream instead.  Also, when I cooked it for the allotted time, the chicken wasn't fully cooked.  I think browning the chicken beforehand would work out better.  Taste was good!

According to my teenaged boys and husband...it was pretty good. I did not use the whipped topping (couldn't imagine that flavor with this). I will make again and try the mayo and sour cream mixture.

Ok, so I also changed this recipe. I used cream of mushroom soup, added 1 cup of chicken broth, 1/2 cup of sour cream, added a can of fried onions to the top and omitted the whipped topping. My whole family loved it. My teenage boys were having seconds before I could finish my plate. Definately would make again!!

I did not care for this recipe. And it took waaaay longer to bake than it said. Thankfully, that meant that my family was starving enough when it came out of the oven to actually eat it. I won't ever make this again!

I made this dish for about 100 people at hour Friday meal. It was a success. I did change it. I used mild cheddar cheese   instead of the processed cheese. I seasoned and browned the chicken before I added to the mixture; I also added a lot of herbs to the mixture. I omitted the frozen whipped cream. I will make it again, but with spinach the next time.

Well, I have to say... this WAS unbelievably yummy! The family loved it. HOWEVER, I did NOT add the whipped topping (no way was I doing that, sorry!), nor did I use processed American cheese. I used fresh grated mozzarella and cheddar combined. I also cooked the chicken pieces with some diced onion before putting everything into a casserole dish. With my changes, I will make it again.

when I read this recipe, the whipped topping didn't make sense so I substituted miracle whip for it. Still just a so-so recipe. Maybe we're just not miracle whip fans.

This was okay.  We have leftovers and will probably not eat them.  It would be better with more herbs.  It just felt like something was missing.
