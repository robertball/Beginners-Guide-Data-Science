I have been making these for aseveral years.  Buy whole green beans and wrap with 1/2 slice bacon around about 6 of them  Add melted butter to the brown sugar, a dash of soy sauce and a little garlic powder.  These will disappear before your eyes.  We call them GREEN BEAN BUNDLES

My daughter makes these for me every holiday as an alternative to green bean casserole. That is good too but I prefer Bacon Wrapped Green Beans. She adds just a touch of garlic and onion powder.

The picture shown is of my dish from a few years ago. This is still a family favorite. A couple things though- the green beans should be blanched first and the bacon cooked but still pliable. I also drizzle butter over the wraps before sprinkling the brown sugar. This is all how the original recipe appeared a few years back.

Tried a small batch before taking to a family gathering where they're accustomed to their meals being served from a fast-food window. The small batch passed the kid test (10 & 12)  and I went back for seconds. After sprinkling with brown sugar, I put seasoned salt on the green beans sticking out. I steamed fresh green beans  for 5 mins after snipping the ends off then baked at 375 for 25 mins. to make sure the bacon was cooked. They passed the test: I'll make them for extended family with undeveloped taste palates, and I'll cross my fingers!

We make these every year for Christmas....but we actually drizzle our favorite BBQ sauce over them instead of the brown sugar; and then right before it is done cooking maybe 5-10 minutes, drizzle some French Onions on top for a crunch.....very delicious.

Huh.  I was expecting these to be GREAT, but I was pretty disappointed.  The beans were perfectly cooked as was the bacon, but I just didn't enjoy the two flavors together.  Plus, it was infuriating wrapping the beans.  The bacon kept falling apart.  Glad a lot of people liked this but I don't think I'll be giving this another go.  Sorry.  :(

I used precooked bacon, blanched the green beans, and baked them for a shorter time.  They were wonderful.  My guests raved about them!  I will definitely make them again.

I set my five year old niece to wrapping these in the bacon after giving her a couple examples.  She worked diligently at it for half an hour and was just as pleased as she could be when we announced they were the yummiest thing on the table.  I don't measure so i just did a little sprinkling of things across the pan and these came off wonderfully.  They need patted a bit at the end because of the bacon grease.

A new family favorite! Used fresh green beans instead of frozen, so they took a little longer to cook, but well worth it. We love these.

I used fresh beans and rather than brown sugar brushed with a light coat of an asian teriyaki sauce. Never thought I would stoop to cook my veggies in bacon grease but the beens were soooo good.  Also, I had some fresh asparagus so I made bundles of both on the same sheet.  Worked out great!

We've been making these for a long time, they are so good! I wrap them in bacon stick a toothpick through it to hold them together and squirt a little gob of ketchup on top and sprinkle with brown sugar! They are delicious!! I actually have the recipe to mine on my profile! Everybody loves these.

These were so good. All 4, yes all 4, of my kids ate these. My younger son would NEVER eat a green bean. I toke fresh green beans, boiled them for several minutes, then wrapped them in half a slice of bacon then cooked them on the grill. Delicious!

I just read over some of the reviews, I'm super excited to try with asparagus, because that's one of my favorite veggies! Also I think I'll try adding the garlic powder and soy sauce next time too. Probably won't add butter though, I'm going to try and keep bacon as healthy as possible :) Thanks for all your input guys, I'm never going to cling to a recipe that would work better another way, and I can't wait to try out the suggestions.

I made these tonight - very labor intensive.  Per other reviews, I baked the bacon in the oven for about 10-12 minutes at 350.  I sprinkled the bacon with onion powder and garlic powder before rolling the beans up in the bacon.  I added the brown sugar over the top of the bacon rolls and seasoned with salt and pepper.  The taste was good (can't really mess up bacon) but I was hoping for better.  I think I would use fresh green beans next time and maybe add Worcestershire sauce or soy sauce for more flavor.  My husband enjoyed them tonight and has even been snacking on the leftovers cold.

I really liked the idea but I like a lot more seasoning on fresh vegetables. I blanched my green beans first then shocked them in ice water. Also, I fried my bacon until it has half cooked before wrapping my green beans. Then I seasoned with brown sugar, soy, garlic, onion, and Tony's (for those that don't live in the South, it's basically steak seasoning you put on everything). It's hard to get my boyfriend to eat vegetables but he didn't hesitate to eat all I made! Picture posted.

These were an excellent veggie side, very flavorful and quick too.  Instead of frozen gr beans though I used fresh and steamed for 5 min.  Went great with bbq ribs.

Wanted to fix something different with green beans and saw this recipe, I thought brown sugar?  So I thought I'll give it a try and we like it.  The second time I made it a little different rather wrapped green beans with bacons.  Cut green beans in a square dish, sprinkle cooked bacon (not all the way, it finish cooking in the oven) over greens beans and black pepper over it.  Don't need salt since bacon is salted.  Either way wrapped with bacon on just sprinkle over the beans it's good.

Good, but next time I make them I will steam the beans a little first before I bake them so make them softer.  They were hard using recepe.

Very good and easy BUT they took MUCH longer to cook so the bacon is done and what a mess on the pan. I will leave extra time and use foil lined pan or parchment paper next time. Will make again.

So delicious!!  Even the picky kids ate them like candy!!  Cooked them exactly as written. Used about 3 lbs. fresh green beans, though.

I've never had green beans be the first dish to be emptied.  All 5 of my kids loved this.  I did change it, I used frozen cut green beans and I chopped the bacon and mixed them in a saute pan.

I made these and the flavor was good, but I had to cook longer than posted- the bacon didn't cook all the way. I am pretty sure I put way to many green beans in the bundle though. But I will make again!

I used fresh green beans and substituted 1tsp of powdered garlic instead of the brown sugar.  Very tasty and the whole family loved it—will certainly bd making this again.

I used Applewood smoked bacon. Was my only change. It was great. They disappear. Some people didn't even get any they disappeared so quickly. Now a staple in this family Thanksgiving and Christmas.

I followed the ingredient recipe.  I did precook the bacon about 20 minutes and secured the bundles with a toothpick.  It was a different way to serve the green beans and I thought they were tasty--a nice change and made for a more elegant or special dish for company.

Made with home grown green beans. Very tasty!   I drizzled with some honey and a little Italian dressing Cooked about 30 minutes. Next time  I make, I'm going to try turning on broiler for final 2-3 minutes.

Tip?  Do not use thick cut bacon.  It took too long to cook, so the beans got overdone.

My family are not vegetable eaters.  I have to find recipes to hide good nutritional veggies.  Adding bacon wraps to the green beans worked as the did get their vegetables.   This takes more effort but worth it.  I loved it too.

This had some fundamental issues.  20 minutes is nowhere near enough time to cook the green beans.  If you like crunchy, raw green beans then the cooking times are fine but otherwise, the green need to be parboiled before baking.  However,  The flavor is phenomenal!  I drizzled some melted butter and worchestershire on top before baking.  This will be our new favorite green bean recipe.  Thanks!

Because I had fresh beans on hand to use, I steamed by beans until crisp tender and when cool, wrapped in bacon. The next time I will microwave my bacon until slightly cooked.  It was much to raw for me to eat.  This recipe adds a nice flair to green beans.

Haven't made this yet! Sounds good! Anything with bacon, right?  The recipe calls for cut green beans...aren't those cut to 1-2" pieces? Shouldn't that be corrected?

These are amazing and my family has made them at holidays every year since I could remeber. Though instead of brown sugar we would put barbque sauce on them before cooking. Made a real mess but is very delicious.

This dish did not turn out great.  The beans were over cooked and the bacon undercooked. The flavours worked well together so I think I'll give it another shot with precooked bacon.

I have made these twice since trying at Christmas. This recipe was a huge hit, on the second time making these, I added some small par-boiled red potatoes to the pan. I'm going to keep this recipe and use it  a lot.

Made these for a cookout as an easy side. I added garlic powder like others suggested. Everyone loved them! They were all gone!

This is an OK recipe. I tried using fresh green beans from the backyard of a friend. If you are going that route, I would highly recommend to cook it for twice as long because the fresh cut green beans will take longer to cook. Also, cook them covered with aluminum foil for the first half of the cooking process then remove the foil for the rest of the cooking time to finish. Another option is to blanche them and cool them in ice water before wraping and baking for the original 20 minutes or less. At all times if you try blanching or fresh green beans, keep an eye so you do not overcook or burn them.

My family claimed they liked these but I thought they were a bit rubbery, like they should have cooked longer.

This was a big hit at my house, the bacon could have been a little bit crispier I think, maybe next time I will leave it longer and see about that. but otherwise everyone loved it!

Better than I expected. I tried this out to get my daughter to eat green beans. I loved the sweet & salty taste from the bacon and brown sugar.

I never write reviews but I had to write this time.  These were awesome!  I sprinkled with soy sauce and garlic powder like another reviewer suggested.  I also used fresh green beans, steamed, because I don't like them that hard.  I will definitely be bringing this to my next family get together.

Used fresh green beans rather than frozen and they came out a little dry. Quite tasty though - next time I may try blanching them (or maybe the frozen ones are more moist?).

I liked the recipe, but I don’t think 20 minutes is sufficient enough time to allow the bacon the fully cook through.  I have increased the time on this recipe to 30 minutes, and it comes out better this way, every time.

Super easy, and cheap to make.  I cut a whole pound of bacon down the center, grabbed a bag of frozen green beans, and that was it!  Made 2 pans of the beans for our team baseball party which were gone in a matter of minutes!  Thanks for the recipe!!

A different take on green beans. A little rich for my taste but the family enjoyed them. I prefer parboiled.
