I made this at work for a baby shower and everyone who had some LOVED it! We called it a "nojito" for fun.

Very refreshing. These were a plus because everyone from the toddlers on up were able to enjoy. Instead of discarding the mint leaves, I left them in the mixture, and used a pitcher with strainer holes. The mint boosted the flavor that way. Great summertime drink!

Very refreshing and delicious!  I do not consume alcohol so I cannot compare this drink to a real mojito but all of my guests enjoyed this version.  I only used 1 cup of sugar and had to substitute 4 cups of gingerale because I only had 4  of the 8 required cups of club soda on hand.

We made this for our New Year's Eve party. We used fresh limes muddled with the mint leaves like in a real Mojito. Everyone loved it and we never missed the alcohol.
