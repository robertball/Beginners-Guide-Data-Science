This is a great punch recipe.  It can be made all year long.  I have an everyone loves it.  I just omitted the spices so wouldn't taste like a Christmas punch.  One piece of advice, one time I made it and I got carried away with the Grand Marnier and didn't think it would affect the taste very much considering Grand Marnier has an orange flavor however it did and it wasn't a positive result.  Stick with just the 2 T it really is exactly what you need.

This punch is fab! I have made it for the last three Christmas parties at my home and everyone loves it, I freeze some of the juice I use and use it for Ice directly in the punch. I cant have a party without it.

Really yummy. The spices give it just enough flavor to taste like Christmsd without being overwhelming.

The day I made it, it was good but the days that followed were the best.   Next time I will make it a few days before so the dry ingredients and dissolve well.

Made this last year and LOVED it, big hit at the Christmas Party.   Just found the recipe again and will make it this year.   I was bummed out when I couldn't find it, so now I'm pumped .
GREAT punch!

I have served this twice in the last 10 days--once for a holiday party, and then at Christmas dinner. EVERYBODY loved it. It's the best punch ever. Highly recommend. Followed the recipe exactly.

Made this to go with appetizers before Christmas dinner and it was delicious.  Cut back just a bit on the amount of spices because I was concerned about them being too overwhelming.  The punch was perfect.  This will be my new "go to" punch for all my holiday parties.  Thanks so much for a great recipe!
