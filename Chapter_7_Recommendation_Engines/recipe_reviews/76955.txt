Since I wasn't sure of how the orange idea would go over with us, I opted out of the orange zest and I think this was perfect without it.  The orange juice caramelizes quickly, so watch carefully as it reduces! The citrus flavor is a great match for the asparagus and the glaze is beautiful drizzled over the asparagus and on the serving plate.  Unique and refreshingly different contrast of  flavors.

Wow, this was really a pleasant surprise!  I really liked it.  Changes I made: 1) I used 1 cup of orange juice to create more sauce; 2) I don't have a 12" frying pan with a lid, so I substituted a Dutch oven-it worked great; and 3) I turned down the heat after pulling the asparagus out so the sauce wouldn't burn (oranges have a high amount of sugar).  Next time: 1)I may add cumin or other dried spice next time to thicken the glaze and spice it up, depending on the main dish and 2) to avoid undesireable day after "asparagus side effects," next time I will use broccoli.  That's the only reason I would give 4 stars, but that's not the fault of the asparagus.

this gets a 5 star rating because it was very quick (about 7 minutes) and tasted delicious.  i made the recipe exactly as it is and it turned out very well.  i'm sure that adding pecans or other things would also be very good, but it is delicious without as well.

We love asparagus just about any way it is served, and this was one more easy and yummy way to serve it.  Next time I will add some arrowroot to the orange juice before serving to thicken it so it will be more like a glaze.

These were really good as written. The only change I made was to use tangerine juice and zest. I also threw in some fresh tangerine slices during the last minute which was a hit.

I was looking for a side to have with my baja chicken and this was even better than it sounds. I followed the directions exactly and it was really easy to pull together and totally yummy!

I thought this was good.  As another reviewer questioned...how much is a bunch?  I know at the supermarket the asparagus is normally sold in bunches, but I don't know if they are "bunched" in any uniform way.  Anyway, I did cut the recipe down to only two servings but did add a little extra orange juice and zest.  The orange adds a nice tangy zip to it.  The sauce never thickened up so I just poured it over and enjoyed.

I thought this was pretty good but it could use some more spices.  I opted out of the zest since my husband generally does not prefer the texture, however, if I make this again I will include it.  There was not enough orange flavor to suit me.

This was really good. Even my daughter, who whined heartily about having to eat at least one piece raised her eyebrows and said "Mmmm" and ate more.  My husband prefers another method I usually use, but said it was a nice change.

I love asparagus, but this wasn't my favorite. My husband and daughter ate it, so it was OK. I'm glad I didn't add the orange zest, I thought the orange flavor was way too strong with just the o.j.

Not being sure how much a "bunch" would be (at my store it's sold in 1-pound bundles) I took a pound bundle to be a "bunch". It wasn't. One pound seems to me to be approximately 3 bunches, because I divided the servings down to 3 and thought I'd have liked to have tripled the sauce :-) This was good, but not great. I prefer the admittedly less healthy recipes using butter and/or Parmesan. Thanks for the recipe though, it *was* good :)

I didn't realize I was out of EVOO, so I used some half EVOO/Canola oil mixture I found in the cupboards. The glaze didn't thicken for me even after 5 or 6 minutes, so I just gave up and poured what I had over the asparagus. It steamed nicely, but I didn't notice that much orange flavor. My grandma and little sister loved the consistency of the asparagus, but only my grandma commented about the "extra dimension" of flavor that the orange added. I wasn't sure if she was just saying that to be nice because she knew how I made it, or if she just noticed it the most because she got the first serving of asparagus and the orange didn't saturate to the bottom of the asparagus pile. I'll probably try making it again with pure EVOO and soak the asparagus in the orange juice for a bit before cooking it.

I was a little skeptical at first about how the citrus flavor would combine with the asparagus taste, but it was really yummy after it sat in the juices for a bit.  Definitely a keeper!

I love Asparagus and usually only steam it crisp. I tried this recipe as I had people over and wanted something more impressive. I didn't like the bitter taste of the orange peel, I think it would taste better without the last step. Might make it again without the peel.

Very good and very easy. But, it works just as well to just mix the oil and orange juice in and cook it until it glazes. I haven't had to remove the the veggies and then make the glaze. Just leave it all together. I also add a little ground ginger to it. Works well with broccoli too.

Nice, different way to serve asparagus.  I liked the orange flavoring in this.  This was served with 'Simple Carnitas' and 'Peppered Cilantro Rice'.  This vegetable worked very nicely with the meal and I would make it again.

Really good!! The texture of the asparagus was perfect. My 3year old even liked it. Only gave it four stars b/c it did not have much orange flavor with juice alone. Will add the zest next time, should not be optional. Went great with my baja  chicken!!!

This has a very nice sweetish flavor that's quite different from typical asparagus recipes and it's very refreshing. The zest definitely adds flavor to the glaze and I would highly recommend adding it.  I would add a little bit of spice to make the final flavor profile more interesting. Otherwise it tends to be a little too sweet (hence one star less). I would recommend adding some mild paprika or chili flakes and some cumin powder to increase the flavor.

Although I ended up overcooking the asparagus, this recipe was fabulous! I love the idea to use orange juice to create a delicious glaze for an already tasty veggie. Everyone at the dinner party thought it was a great new way to play with flavors and create a wonderful side dish...and in such a short amount of time!

Five stars for being quick and delicious!  I really liked this recipe.  Making the sauce ahead of time and then adding the asparagus a few four minutes before the sauce is done (when it is already thick), seems like the best option to get the glaze.  I think I'll try that next time.

Pretty good as is.  The sauce glazes nicely.  Add just a sprinkle of ground ginger to really perk it up!

Loved it! I will say that I made it with green beans, but I switch back and forth between green beans and asparagus recipes all the time. I will definitely make this with asparagus next time it's on sale. Thanks for the yummy recipe!

What a simple and elegant accompaniment to this year's Thanksgiving turkey!  I will make this a tradition.  Goes very well with the "Cranberry Sweet Potato Bake" recipe.

Very good. I cooked the asparagus for a couple of extra minutes with the glaze instead of just pouring it on the cooked asparagus. Yummy!

I should have followed the advice to add the Arrowroot powder to thicken the sauce.  The flavor was good, but I would have prefered a 'sauce' rather than juice in the bottom of the bowl.  That aside, it passed the kid test, so we'll definately be eating it again.

I will make it again. I usually roast asparagus with lots of garlic. I liked this very much, but might try with some garlic next time just to try it!!

My 9 yr old LOVED it. That alone should sell anyone. I actually let the asparagus soak in the orange juice for an hour or so before cooking.  There is NOT an overpowering orange flavor.  I liked it but didnt love it. I will make it again. Anything green the kids will eat!

YUM!!!  So quick and easy.  Added a bit of cornstarch and water to juice to thicken it better.  It was outstanding.

I also used OJ with high pulp.  We thought it was good but a little bland. On the other hand, it was very quick and easy.

This was delicious and much better than other recipes because it calls for so little salt.

I overcooked the asparagus, so I didn't try too much of this, but what I did try was pretty tasty. My husband really like the flavor of the glaze even though he doesn't like asparagus. We're going to try it with broccoli sometime. I may try asparagus again and make sure I don't overcook it. I don't think it was my favorite, but I generally like my veggies with just a little butter and salt. It was fun to try though and had a good flavor.

This is easily the best asparagus I have ever made.   I ended up using high pulp orange juice which slightly thickened the sauce and gave it great flavor.

I used fresh orange juice and I added a few toasted pecan.
The  pecan made a major difference.  But overall this recipe was just , OK.  I will not be making this again.  It just didn't quite work for me.  Maybe I am doing something wrong.
