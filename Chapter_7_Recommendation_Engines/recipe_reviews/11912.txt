We loved this, even Scott who doesn't like cold pasta.  I did make a coupld of changes.  We used can chicken (don't like tuna)(I put in in a bowl and separated the chunks with a fork), used the little salad macaronies, red pepper instead of green and add chopped cucumber.  We also used lite miracle whip instead of the mayo (we're not big mayo fans).  I'd been looking for an easier way to make chicken mac salad and this was perfect.  You couldn't even tell that the chicken was canned, and it was so much easier than boiling that chicken all day.  thanks:-)

Yum.  I have made this twice now, the first time following it to a tee for (tuna macaroni) & the second time just looking for macaroni salad, in which I changed a bit.  I used eggs instead of tuna, miracle whip instead of mayo, red peppers instead of green, and per my hubbys suggestion, ketchup instead of mustard (which was a suprisingly pleasnt change).  We like it both ways!  Thanks Jennie!

Great recipe if you don't like a sweet macaroni salad. My husband who hates the normal sweet macaroni salad loves this. He said what ever you do don't lose this recipe.  I used one can of tuna and three boiled eggs and only 1 tbls of garlic powder.

I followed this recipe exactly.  There was too much garlic for my taste. Also, my house smelled of garlic for 3 days because of this recipe. I would not make this again, and would reccomend anyone else trying this recipe start with less garlic powder and add until it suits your taste.

We were entertaining some neighbors and I made this to go along with a brisket and red potatoes.  I didn't have any tuna, so I left it out, but added chopped boiled eggs.  Instead of celery, I like to add minced onions and some paprika.  I've read over other macaroni salad recipes that add some cider vinegar to the mayo.  I'm thinking that would give it a sweet and sour taste, which I think I might try when I DO make this again. My company loved it!! Thanks bunches Jennie.

Made it first time and immediate realize that I must use honey Dijon mustard instead.  I also added paprika and about 1 and 1/2 of table spoon of Dill pickle juice to taste.  Without paprika and pickle juice it is kinda flat.

I was looking for a super easy lunch and this was perfect!  I added a pinch of celery salt (my husband hates celery, so we compromised) and took the advice on using a little bit of pickle juice.  Very tasty!!!  I will definitely use this recipe again!!

This has become my holy grail macaroni salad recipe. I took it to a church supper a couple of months ago, and it was a big hit!! I did make a minor change, in that I used Miracle Whip in place of the mayonnaise. Try it, you won't be disappointed.

Excellent & quick!!!I've made this several times already and is so easy to make after I get home from work when I don't know what else to make.  Very tasty! My mom and husband loved it too!  I make this recipe now instead of the one I always used to make with eggs! Thanks! :)

Wow! How about that garlic? Good salad, but I cut garlic back to 1t, used 4 green onions, 1 cup mayo, and 1T Dijon mustard. Hard cooked eggs will be used next time I make this. Thanks Jennie.

I have searched FAR and WIDE for this recipe. I am exceptionally picky about my macaroni salad and could never quite replicate my grandmother's recipe, which I loved. This recipe gave me what I needed. However, all I used was macaroni, onion, celery, mayo & mustard. PERFECT and very "old fashioned". Pretty simple and just what I wanted. Thank you!

If it weren't for all the accessive garlic it would have been a 5.  Next time i will cut it back because it's not needed and I may be in pain for hours after eating it.  I used sweet peas in place of the bell pepper since we didn't have any and I also added olives.

I made this and changed this alittle b/c it was alot like a recipe my mom used to make. I used a whole box of macaroni, I added 3 long pickle quarters chopped into small pieces, I also added about 2 tbs of the pickle juice and I only used 3 heaping tbs of mayo since I added the pickle juice. I also didn't use the mustard and I added season salt w/ the seasonings, I also used less garlic powder, without even trying it 2 tbs sounds like ALOT of garlic I was wondering if it should read 2 teas. I probably added about 1/2 teas. I added the rest of the ingredients it called for. It looks wet at first but after sitting in the fridge for an hour or so the wetness soaks in and it was perfect! This was AWSOME!!! You could do alot to this recipe and it would come out great each time! Thanks.. I really missed this recipe and I'm glad you were featured on todays Daily Recipes!

If there is one salad that brings back childhood memories it is this one.  Whenever we had a summer picnic it was always on the table.  Love it so and glad to have found the recipe.

Eh, it was ok.  I did add some of the things that other people suggested (hard boiled eggs, cucumber, pickles) but this salad just didn't do it for me.  Even after added a ton of salt it still tasted bland.  I like the recipe on the side of the Mueller's box better.  Sorry.

This recipe is almost identical to my own Macaroni salad recipe with a couple of changes:
We hate celery, so I leave that out. I use red pepper instead of green pepper. I always add  3  ingredients that make my tuna macaroni salad special: a few chopped pickles, a shredded carrot, and a half a box of frozen green peas. I've brought this salad to a ton of camping trips and potlucks, and EVERYONE loves it! I also throw in a few dashes of Ranch dressing if I happen to have some in the fridge! 
Everyone always asks if I'm bringing the macaroni salad!

I tried this recipe out for the 4th of July barbecue.  I omitted the tuna (my husband is allergic) and added hard-boiled eggs, which we love (I used 6 of them), as well as salad cubes (added a lot more green pepper to it!!!). This recipe does NOT taste sickeningly sweet like the store-bought, but adds an interesting flavor to the meal.  Warning:  if you're not a garlic lover, cut down on the garlic by half, you can smell this dish from miles away.  This was an interesting twist on macaroni salad, but I'm not sure I'd make it again because of the heavy amount of garlic.

I used turkey breast cut up instead of the tuna and used spicy brown mustard and a cubanelle pepper.  I was worried about the amount of garlic powder but it worked fine for my taste.  I imagine all kinds of add-ins you could try with this but it's very good as is.

The fact that it is a Tuna Macaroni salad should be listed in your title. I make mine with a sweet onion, also for less  experienced cooks- mention onion size or to taste. This ammount of mayo is too wet for my taste- I add enough to bind. Don't be afraid to customize this by using Dijon mustard as opposed to yellow mustard

Good, except waaaay too much garlic. I made it for myself over a weekend, which was fortunate since I quite literally exuded garlic -- could smell it on my skin. At least I kept the vampires away.

I love garlic, but this recipe should cut the garlic by about two thirds. I made it again using 2 teaspoons and it was perfect.

So simple, I had all ingredients on hand. Improvised garlic salt in place of garlic powder (and went easy on that since other reviewers mentioned it being too garlicky). Used what Miracle Whip I had remaining and used mayo too. I'll have to remember this recipe!

This is perfect for me. I used 1 box of elbow macaroni, 1 can of tuna and 5 hard boiled eggs, a splash or two of dill pickle juice, and real mayonnaise with the garlic powder, salt and pepper. Delicious! Thanks for sharing :)

This recipe was a hit at my potluck luncheon today. I did follow some of the advice of several folks who posted reviews ..I only used 1 can of tuna, added 3 eggs, reduced the garlic powder to 1 tsp..Everything else I kept the same..everyone loved it...and it was not dry after being in the fridge overnight...

Too much onion and garlic powder. I like garlic but between the onion and the fake garlic flavor it was not good. May try again with less onion and one real garlic clove.

We made this for our superbowl party to accompany the homemade burgers my boyfriend made. We omitted the tuna and bell pepper but added fine shredded carrots. We got many compliments on this recipe will be a repeat!

i had some left over tuna salad that i knew no one would touch in days, so i made this.  i halved the recipe, and by golly it was g-o-o-d.  i was jonesing for that macaroni salad one of my staff shared with me so i added some raisins.  it was a great contrast to the mustard.  (for some reason, the mustard really stood out.)

WOW!  This is really good!  I hesitated at 2 Tbs of garlic but I am a garlic lover and thought what the heck and was glad I did.  Verrrrrrrry tasty!  I substituted 4 hard boiled eggs for the tuna.

Wow! This is excellent. I made this to have for lunches the next few days, and it is very good. I had everything on hand to make it, except that I used red pepper instead of green and only had one can of tuna, so I also added two hard boiled eggs. I prefer Miracle Whip to mayo, so I used half and half. Also used celery salt instead of regular salt. Love it! Thanks for sharing!

After tasting this I thought it had waay too much mayo in it, so I kept adding more macaroni..I ended up using the whole box!  I added another can of tuna to compensate for the volume.  I also only used about 1/2 the garlic powder and mustard.  It came out quite good!

Although the title says "Old Fashioned" I think this recipe is wonderfully unique. Garlic is the KEY to this recipe! Don't even think about reducing it! This is a recipe my late wife used to make for picnics, potlucks, etc. and every time she served it, there were people asking for the recipe. I've lost her original recipe, but I'm so glad I found this one! I've been cravin git!

Very good pasta salad.  I substituted light Miracle Whip for the mayonnaise, and reduced it to 1/2 cup.  I also substituted red pepper and dijon mustard for green and regular.  I reduced the garlic powder to 2 tsp, and added 1 Tbl of cider vinegar, 1 tsp prepared horseradish, and two chopped hard-boiled eggs.

Made it as written and we thought it was good.  Then took the advice of other reviewers and replaced one can of tuna with 2 hard boiled eggs.  We liked it better that way.

As is I would only rate a 3 as there is way too much garlic powder per our taste.  I think this recipe does have a lot of potential.

This was pretty good, but perhaps a bit too much of something I couldn't put a finger on.  Maybe the garlic, though I usually like lots of garlic.  Left out the green pepper.  I'm sure I'll make it again, perhaps cutting the garlic a bit.  One thing though is that I can't see this being 10 servings, even adding back in the volume of the pepper.

This recipe is great! I don't like onions so left them out but I substituted one green bell pepper, instead used half a green and half red bell pepper. I also took other posted advice and used only 1 tbsp garlic powder. Turned out delicious. Try it out!

I wanted something a bit different than the usual macaroni salad, but it was different all right. Despite the small amount of mustard I added, it was way too much.

My mom made some version of this for years.  I made this version and it was pretty good.  Definately use only 1/4 or half of onion.  I also added sliced black olives, which I think really MAKES the dish.

This recipie sounds good. Actually I made a version of this at home. Less onion needed (only need a tbsp), less mayo (add to taste) and add a chopped egg to accentuate flavor.  Otherwise, is good.

This is an awesome recipe.  I used too much
onion (I used a white onion, next time will try
either green onion or purple onion..any
other onion that is not quite so strong.
The strong onion spoiled the taste, but 
yet it was good.  I skipped the tuna (didn't use anything in its place)
completely and it was good.

My husband is a macaroni salad lover and he gave this one a "Double Thumbs Up"!  Rather than use tuna, I substituted about 1 1/2 cups of salad shrimp. I would definitely prepare this salad again.

I usually don't change a recipe the first time I try it but I did cut the garlic powder in half as others suggested. It turned out pretty good. Even better the next day. The next time I make it I will use half miracle whip and half mayo to give it a little sweeter taste.

It was simply amazing! It was probably the best macaroni salad i've ever tasted. Since i didn't have any green bell pepper, I replaced it with one carrot that i have grated. Also, for the onion, I used red onion just because it gives color and, for me, it has a better taste then any other type of onion.

I loved this and have FINALLY found my go-to Macaroni Salad recipe.  Was making for a Volleyball gathering so I doubled the recipe but did NOT double the onion or garlic (social gathering/lots of kids).  I also omitted the tuna and instead put in 4 hard boiled eggs, and sub'd red pepper for the green, which I minced.  If making for home I would leave the onion the same and probably still halve the garlic. This DEFINITELY needs to sit overnight ... the flavors were SO MUCH BETTER the next day ... and onion totally mellowed out (thank god!).  Will try with the tuna as well. GREAT recipe!

Very good.  We used orange pepper instead of green.  Used about 1/2 cup chopped onion.  I only added 1 1/2 tablespoon of garlic powder and only 1 cup mayo.  Then we added cucumber and dill pickle relish and it was great.  But I am sure it would be great just as written.  We just embelished.

My husband and I thought this recipe was very good.  I only used 1 cup mayo and added a boiled egg.  Also I didn't have macaroni so I used whole wheat noodles.  I wasn't sure how it would turn out but it was good.  I'm sure with macaroni it will be great.  This is a keeper.

I really loved this recipe. The only thing I did different is instead of rinsing off the noodles I drained them and I added 6 slices of kraft American cheese and omitted green peppers and mustard. Instead I added 3 tbsp of French dressing. I did all this at once. No extra bowls or cooling off and instead of using a spoon to stir, I used my hands, it was excellent. I did notice that the recipe asked for 2c of noodles but I used 4c of dry elbow noodles, I could've used  a little more mayo but still I put it refrigerator over night and it was good. We had it Memorial day.

Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too much onion, way, way, WAY!
Followed exactly, stunk up my fridge, tasted alright but never to be duplicated.  Sorry. 
1 whole (even small) onion AND the garlic powder were overkill.

Fantastic!  I only rated it a 4 because I took the advice of others and cut down on the garlic and mustard, added paprika, and used some dill pickle relish (since I had no pickles to use juice).  The pickle relish really added the missing zip to this salad.

Great taste! I only had 1 can of tuna, and no green pepper, so I should have cut down on the garlic powder a little. It still was wonderful!

My husband wanted a macaroni salad like his Mother use to make. This was all I could find close to hers.  I did double it (we were serving 20 people) did not add the tuna (I was worried not all would like it) everyone did like it. After the party my husband wanted to add the tuna to see what it would taste like. We loved it (next time I will make just like original recipe), it is very good both ways.

I took this to a cook-out and everyone enjoyed it. I still think that the recipe lacked a little something, but judging by the amount I had left to take home (about half), I think I will try and add my own twist to this one to get the flavor I am looking for. Maybe a little seasoned salt.

I used crab meat instead of tuna, which my husband won't eat.  Good this way, but not a lot of flavor.  Could it be the crab substitution?

Hi, happy so many have used this recipe and found it as a simply recipe to add their choice of variations to make it their recipe. This is my recipe,  this is the way my husband eats this but I grew up eating it with black pepper, onions, and sometimes some dry ranch seasoning sprinkled on it. ( I did this later after Ranch dressing came out) Even some diced red pepper in it. We always added more mayo after it came out of fridge because the noodles seem to absorb it, and that makes it creamy again. So,....now I'm telling you, add ingredients to my simple beginning cold Mac & tuna salad your own, or like it is written for your taste preference! Thank you for trying this and reviewing it, whether good or bad. Happy and good eating.

Big hit at our small group dinner.  Used  orange and yellow peppers (don't like green ones and had the others on hand), used carrots (didn't have celery on hand), used a clove of fresh garlic instead of the powder, subbed green onions for color and a small bit of broccoli (because it needed to be used) and I added smoked paprika because I love it and put it on everything!

This is a very nice, simple, macaroni salad! Just what I remember from my nana.                                                           I did use red peppers instead of green but stuck to the recipe, otherwise. I found the amount of garlic powder too much so I used a fresh clove the next time.                          We found it was so nice the next day as the macaroni absorbed the flavours well. Excellent for packed lunches for a day or two afterwards.

Great recipe--But if you want it moist with less mayo--add a little olive oil or Italian dressing to the macaroni before adding the other ingredients

An excellent macaroni salad for those, like me, who cannot stand sweet  variations.  I was concerned that two cans of tuna would make it too "fishy," so I substituted 3 hard boiled eggs instead for one of the cans.  I used fresh garlic in lieu of garlic salt and green onions for the "onion" ingredient.  This salad was good the first day, but as expected, even better the second day.  A great recipe for those blast-furnace summer days here in Texas, thanks Jennie!

I made this recipe as written and it was delicious. I will be using this recipe regularly. I didn't think there was too much garlic as one reviewer stated. I could taste a hint of mustard, which gave it a pleasant flavor. Definitely a keeper. Thank you for the recipe.

This dish was a hit with my family. I followed the recipe but used seasoned salt instead of plain salt and I also added some onion powder. Will definitely be making this again!

This  is almost exactly my family's recipe, only we don't put mustard and we do put pickle relish.  I don't use a lot of garlic, either.  I sometimes sprinkle a little garlic salt instead of plain salt for the extra flavor.  I also sprinkle a little extra celery seed in mine because my family really likes celery.  It's a great summer dish!

This is the classic recipe I remember from my childhood...we loved it! The only changes I made: only 1 Tablespoon of honey mustard, I used 1/2 cup miracle whip and 1 cup mayonnaise (just my preference).

I read the other reviews & made as the recipe calls except left out half of the garlic.  It was not good & husband was not a fan at all.  So went back through the reviews to see if I could add something to make it better.  Added sweet relish, sugar, & sweet red bell pepper.  It's OK.  It still tastes really garlicky! The garlic is very strong in it & the green bell pepper is a bit much.

Not into garlic in any form in a Macaroni Salad, so I sat down and started to revise the recipe. When I was done I realized I had basically rewritten the recipe to match a great recipe, which is also on this site - "Mom's Best Macaroni Salad"!

I used eggs instead of tuna because I forgot we donated all the tuna to Stamp Out Hunger a couple of weeks ago.  Turned out fantastic!  Oh, and like another suggested, I used a red pepper instead of green.  I'm sure it would have been great as written, but I used what was convenient and it turned out fabulously!

This is a great recipe, but I always make it with a few changes. I always omit the celery because I don't like it. I also always add about a cup of frozen peas and about 2 T Italian salad dressing to give it a little zip.  Thanks.

This recipe is quite good. The celery and green pepper adds some crunch to it. HOWEVER, I tweaked it by adding one cup of mayo and one cup of Miracle Whip (adds some tang and keeps the salad from drying out) some paprika and the missing ingredient, SWEET RELISH. Adding the relish kicked this up to where my family loves the salad more than before.

Delicious! I added 2 eggs, 10 sliced kalamata olives, and used red pepper instead of green. I want to eat the whole bowl myself. Thanks for the recipe!
