I've tried this with bottled mix, but frozen concentrate works better.  I also add cilantro, a dash of cumin, and a little garlic.  You can taste the frozen concentrate much more than the bottled mix.  My kids LOVE this chicken!

A family favorite, especially after a couple of additions...After turning chicken on the grill, add 2 tablespoons of salsa and top with grated cheddar cheese (or Mexican blend).  Once chicken is done cooking the salsa will be heated through and the cheese melted.  A wonderful southwestern twist.

I have not yet prepared this recipe but after reading ALL the reviews, now I'm definitely going to try it.  Seems that people either loved it or hated it!  I'm wondering if the brand of Margarita mix makes a difference - also, some mixes have the tequila included and some don't.  The ingedients aren't specific.  That could make a big difference in the end result.

As is, it's a recipe that depends entirely on the margarita mix you buy (I'd rate it 3 stars), but with a few very simple additions - it transforms to a 5 star chicken. Even though my version changes every time I make it, here are some basic ingredients to try: to the margarita mix, add 3-4 chopped garlic cloves, 1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro, 1 teaspoon dried oregano, 1 teaspoon of salt (or 1 tablespoon of soy sauce), freshly ground black pepper. Sometimes I also add some chili powder for some kick. The method of marinading chicken breast in margarita mix makes for very tender and juicy grilled chicken breast that could otherwise end up very dry; also marinading even for an hour infuses a good amount of flavor into the meat. Definitely try it, but be sure to pick a margarita mix you like.

After having let this set in the marinade forever and seeing how much of it was soaked up into the chicken, I thought I would really get a good flavor.  Don't know what I did wrong but it was just grilled chicken...no margarita taste at all.  I will say it was very tender, and we all ate it anyway and enjoyed it.  I will search further for a grilled chicken recipe w/the taste I'm looking for.

We have feel in love with this recipe! Its great in mexican dishes or just alone as a main course! I do add the juice of a whole lime and zest. Jose Curveo is the best name brand margarita mix!! Cook it on the grill or bake it in the oven.

LOVE IT!!! We serve this over a bed of carribean rice and with Lime Chips and homemade salsa on the side.  We also INJECT the chicken with FROZEN margarita right before grilling... really adds MORE flavor ~if that is what you are lacking. And if you have an extra can of frozen margarita concentrate brush on while grilling.   I use frozen Bacardi Margarita.

Made as directed and it was not a hit with our family.  I think it would be better if it was used as a filler for fajitas.  It just seemed like it was missing something.

I let it marinade several hours but couldn't taste the margarita mix.  It was very bland, with a LITTLE citrus taste.  Will not make it again. No one in my family liked it so I had to use the leftover meat in another totally different dish.

This was so simple.  I switched out the chicken with thin strips of steak and added cilantro, salt and pepper to the marinade.  I don't think I have ever had steak so flavorful. I never would have thought to use margarita mix as a  marinade so thank you for the excellent idea.  I will definitely do this again:)

This is a great recipe. I like to add minced garlic and cayenne pepper, and I throw in lime juice and fresh lime (and perhaps a few lemon) slices.  Also, I like to use boneless skinless chicken breasts and cut them up in halves or strips and/or pierce them before marinating so that the chicken really takes on the flavor.  It's a great summer dish served with pinnapple rice and asparagus or fresh green beans.

when you prep the marinade, the frozen concentrate does taste better, but if you don't add the tequila, you are wasting your time-the alcohol helps with the tenderizing. I also added some chopped onion, garlic and cilantro. Get an extra can of mix for drinking while you cook and make it a real Cinco de Mayo party!

I couldn't taste much flavor. The chicken was really good but I think it was because of the grill not so much the margarita flavor.    I tried this recipe two different ways both without honey.  I let it marinade over night and one bag I overlooked and it was in the fridge for another day.  I used the frozen mix at the suggestion of one reviewer as well.  Neither bag seemed to have much flavor.  If I was to try it again I would try the bottle mix to see if it is any better.

I marinated over night and the flavor was too strong for me ( I used bottled mix).  I think it would have tasted better with adding something to complement the lime flavor.  I think next time I will try experimenting by adding fresh herbs and at the end of grilling add packaged tex mex shredded cheese over top.  Thanks for the recipe.

After reading the other reviews, I decided some changes were in order to suit our tastes.  I used Trader Joe's margarita mix because it's not quite as sugary.  I also added maybe 1/4 to 1/2 cup of tequila, some ground cumin, dried oregano, garlic powder and S&P to taste.  Husband grilled it, but he wasn't completely won over; I liked it pretty well, it wasn't too sweet or limey, and the tequila added a subtle touch.  My only minor complaint was that it needed more salt, but I like a pretty salty Margarita!

I got home from work. Put the marinade and chicken breats in a zip lock bag and did some chores. A few hours later I grilled it and my wife and I both loved it. Simple and tasty.

Very yummy. I put a few breasts in the marinade and grilled half of them four hours later and the other other half the next afternoon almost 24 hours later. If you really want the sweetness of the margarita mix, go as long as you can. The shorter time gives it a hint of flavor and makes them very tender. I made the rest in the Basic Chicken Salad recipe from this site and it adds a fun flavor!

Very good!  I misread the recipe and thought it was 2 cups of margarita mix to 3 pieces of chicken.  I realized my mistake after I'd poured the liquid onto 4 pieces of chicken.  Oh, well.  At least the marinade covered the chicken!  I did get a slight margarita taste, and it was goood.  I don't know if I'll make it again bc I'm hoping we won't have anymore excess margarita mix, but I appreciate the recipe and think it's worth a repeat if there's mix lying around.  I'd probably add some salt, pepper, and garlic next time though.  Thanks for the recipe!

This chicken was pretty good. It sort of took on a sweet flavor.  I marinated mine in the margarita mix without tequila so I added a little cumin, garlic, cilantro, salt and pepper.  It took on some nice flavors. I think next time I will chunk it up and make skewers so that the flavors will absorb a little more.

This chicken was wonderful.  It reminds me of the Chilis version of Margarita chicken.  I marindated the chicken in margarita mix with tequila.  The chicken was very moist and tender.  I added salsa and cheese on the top while grilling, giving more added flavor.

Very simple.  I only marinated the chicken breasts for about 7 hours & the could barely taste any flavor.  I will do this recipe one more time and let the chicken marinate overnight

My family liked the flavor. I made 6 breast half with BBQ.sauce and the rest without. I liked them with sauce and the wife preferred without sauce.  Can not get any easier to change up a BBQ. Thanks

After reading the other reviews, I dicided to add additional lime juice and some tequila - about 1/4 cup of each; the alcohol helps the marinade penetrate the meat. The chicken had plenty of "margarita" flavor. It should be noted that the high sugar content of the margarita mix will make it stick to the grill, so a light coating of oil or nonstick spray directly onto the meat before placing on the grill or turning is helpful.

I cut the chicken into chunks for kabobs and marinated it for at least 4 hours. My boyfriend and I didn't care for it at all. The chicken was bland, though it smelled good on the grill. Perhaps, the flavor burned off while cooking. It really tasted nothing like margarita chicken.

Sorry to say, but what a waste of time and money.  What little flavor it did have was sour, so if you want to grill some sort of marinaded chicken, try italian dressing with garlic powder...way cheaper and a lot more flavor!  (I had salad for supper instead.)

It seemed like the acid in the margarita mix "cooked" the chicken. It came out incredibly rubbery.  The flavor also left something to be desired, fairly bland.

This turned out very good. I took advice from other reviews and added about 1/4 cup of tequila to 1 1/2 cup Margarita Mix. I did feel that the chicken needed some salt and pepper when it was done.

We had a Mexican fiesta theme going and made these. This wasn't that great. I think a lime marinade (Fajita marinade maybe?) would have been a better choice.

I read the reviews and did things a little different, and due to poor planning, I improvised.  I forgot to marinate the chicken, and I used frozen margarita mix.  I threw both chicken and frozen margarita mix in the crock pot and cooked on low all afternoon.  The chicken was very tender and easy to shred for chicken tacos.  The chicken was very flavorful!  Almost too much lime flavoring.  My kids are super picky and they ate it, so it made the list to be made again.

I was not a fan of this dish, but it definitely was flavorful. I think that I did not like it because I did not grill the chicken. I cooked it on the stove.

We really enjoyed this dish!  The chicken marinated for 48 hours because my family didn't want chicken two days in a row, so it was very tasty and juicy.  I kept the recipe as is, no changes and it was wonderful.

Excellent! What we did: Bought the margarita mix, & jose cuervo, and the chicken, very thin chicken breasts. Used the amount of mix suggested, and one shot of jose, let them sit for 15 minutes (found this right before we were going to eat). Since they were so thin already, the 15 minutes was perfect. I can not wait to try this again, but we will let them sit for the 4 hours, just to see the difference. Yummy!!

I'm happy to have tried this recipe. It was a complete success. Everyone loved it and I will certainly make it again. But based on some of the reviews I made some changes. First, I butterflied the breasts to insure the marinade would penetrate through the meat. I also crushed 3 Cloves of garlic, added the juice and zest of one fresh lime along with about a 
  tablespoon of Ponsu sauce. I also added a little canola oil in to keep the meat from sticking to the grill. I marinated it for about 6 hours in a storage bag and turned the bag occasionally. It was worth the extra effort and still a simple recipe to make.  Enjoy!

I liked the recipe and made some of the adjustments others noted by adding cumin, cilantro, and garlic.  Yes, I also added alcohol as I wasn't sure with the directions. I let it marinate overnight.  It was very tender.  I thought it had a nice mild flavor; however, my husband and children did not like it.

This was really good! My Mother in law loved it also and she is a picky eater.
