These are for kids.  They barely hold their shape and are an utter mess to cut and pass out.  Super sticky.  Corn syrup is garbage to use as a binder.  Next time, I'm using marshmallows, as every rice-cereal enthusiast knows is the proper thing to use when binding these types of desert together!

If you don't want to use corn syrup... use marshmallows! They'll take care of the sugar and baking soda too. All you do is get one 10 oz bag of marshmallows. Everything else in this treat is amazing!

These turned out great! We made them with Honey instead of the karo syrup and brown sugar instead of white sugar...then left out the M&M's completely and we also just used plain rice crispies.  These have an excellent rich flavor and are really gooey.  We'll be trying this again and again.
