This is very similar to a recipe I use. Just substitute the cheese for whole almonds. It taste like you are eating candy. Sherry

This is SO much better with zero cheese. Bacon Wrapped Dates should be just that, omit the cheese altogether and you will have a luscious recipe.

I have another version of this recipe that has either goat cheese or cream cheese (take your pick) piped into the center of the dates with a frosting bag, then wrapped in bacon.  It's the cheese flavor that makes the difference, I think, and I prefer the goat cheese in this.

Errrr... not by any means the great, classy, yet easy appetizer I was looking for. I tried it out on my friends before my big party. Be happy to know, however, one person out of three liked them!

I used big dates and stuffed with cream cheese and sliced almonds. It was so good. Cheese and almond taste is subtle, but noticeable. Needed 1/3 bacon slice to get around date.

I've NEVER had an appetizer fly off the plate like this one.  I do NOT add cheese.  Wrap the pitted date with the bacon, stick a toothpick in it.  I've been making this one for a couple of years now...easy to make ahead of time.  House smells great while the bacon is cooking and guests are arriving.  One of my all time favourites.  Enjoy!

Use Goat Cheese for this recipe!! If you use enough cheese and crisp the bacon properly, it is sublime. Also pair it with a bed of arugula and drizzle a maple syrup reduction over everything. One of the best bites I've ever had in my life.

I didn't try it with cheddar (sounds sketchy), but with cream cheese it's excellent.  My oven has two broil settings, high and low; 15 minutes on high would have been far too much heat.  15 minutes on low might do it; 7 minutes on high was plenty.  I found them to taste better after they had cooled.

I used cream cheese instead of Cheddar, and marcona almonds, to stuff them. Used 1/2 slice of bacon for each date. I had smoked bacon, but think I would use regular next time. Like another user said, 7 minutes on high broil was perfect. Very tasty, and rich--I made more than our palates could handle. I would make 3 per person, tops.

We first had these at a wedding reception, but the dates were stuffed with feta, and that is how we usually make them.  We'll try bleu cheese, no cheese, almonds and bleu, goat (cheese, ha), pepper jack, and who knows what other creations for our family Christmas party.  These are super-simple to make and way tasty.  I mean, how can you go wrong with bacon?
