After reading the reviews I decided to make a few changes when I made them.  I wanted them to be moist so used 2 regular eggs.  I did not have the dates so I shredded some carrots ,used 1/2 cup .  To make a little more healthy I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 reg. flour.  Also used 1 cup skim milk, and 1/2 cup apllesauce instead of the melted butter.  Added 1/4 cup pecans & 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon for extra flavor. The batter was a little thin so added an extra 1/3 cup oatmeal.  it's not cold anymore so don't make oatmeal in the morning and this recipe is a good way to get oatmeal into your diet.  This recipe turned out good and moist almost like a carrot cake muffin.  Will try with dates next time.

I made this recipe as a gift for a health concious neighbor.  I took them over while her parents, as well as her daughter, son-in-law, and 3 very young grand-daughters were visiting.  All 4 generations loved it!  Personally, I intend to add more brown sugar when I make it for my family, we have quite a sweet tooth!  Also, the recipe yielded a few more muffins that stated, which is always a good thing!

Dates were left out of the ingredient list on this recipe! I added 3/4 cups and it turned out great.

Very tasty and moist!  However, they stuck to the muffin papers.  I think this is a result of omitting the egg yolks, as I've had this issue with some low-fat muffin recipes before.  Next time I will definitely leave in either one or both egg yolks.  That's the only reason it did not rate 5 stars.

I made these to give to friends, but happily had enough to keep a few. After reading other reviews, I made a few adjustments. I used 2 whole eggs, increased the applesauce to 1/3 of a cup, used 1/4 cup canola oil instead of butter. increased the dates to 3/4 cup and added 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  Delicious! Not overly sweet, but flavorful with good texture.

I added the zest of one orange and love the results!  If that had been an ingredient in the original recipe I would have given this 5 stars.  I was very pleased with the moisture level - it may have been due to my modifications:  I used canola oil instead of butter and used one whole egg instead of two egg whites.

They are bland. They were nice and moist (I used 2 full eggs) though. Next time I try them I'll try increasing applesauce and will add raisins, chocolate chips or dried cranberries in addition to the dates.

Use fresh dates.  Muffins taste best when warm and dates are gooey.

AWESOME!  We loved these.  I've been searching for portable treats we can use at road races to replenish energy after the race.  These muffins are in the winner's circle!

Husband doesn't like really sweet stuff so I added bacon to the batter and adjusted the sugar until the batter wasn't overly salty.  Also the batter was really runny so I added more flour to make it more muffin-like.  Really yummy recipe.

I used two whole eggs, had no trouble with it being too dry. The taste was good, and it was very simple to mix up - will definitely be making again! Update: added some nuts, that really set the dates off!

Really liked these! The only change I made was that I used two whole eggs. I froze them and bring one for lunch every day. Soooo filling, satisfying and Yum! Thank you. Oh PS, I forgot they were in the oven (pregnancy brain) so they baked 10 minutes longer than stated to do, which gave them an amazing crispy top. Yum.

Delicious. I read the reviews and modified: used 2 whole eggs, used 1/2 wheat flour, and added a whole pear - pureed- instead of the butter and applesauce. Also added cinnamon and nutmeg. It is moist, the perfect sweetness, and delicious. Made 16 muffins.

This gets my vote for being so moist.  I didn't put dates in, though, because my son won't eat them - so, recipe without them could've used some spunk - perhaps cinnamon.
