I tried it the first time 'as is,' which I believe is necessary when reviewing a recipe. They were fine but browned too fast and were chewy. Based on that and other people's reviews, I made the following adjustments: a) only 1 tbl of sugar in the dough (cuts the browning); b) only 1 tbl of oil in the dough (cuts the chewiness). It should be noted that you only need to mix dry with wet for 30 sec. I also used a churreria, which ensures the right thickness and was brilliant. Made these finger sized with only 5 in the pan at a time - putting too many in the pan lowers the temp of the oil & will cause you to cook them long after they're brown or remove them while still raw. Take them out to drain, put the next batch in the fryer and shake the cooling (now warm not hot) ones in a paper bag with the sugar and cinnamon; a second person is not needed. I would recommend doubling the recipe for anyone wanting to serve more than 2-3 people without having to double the sugar/cinnamon coating. Halve the sugar/cinna mix if only making one batch. Real churros in Spain are not light and fluffy; they're like this. All in all, a good recipe. :)

Easy recipe Delia!  My husband thought it was difficult to make.  Did not have a pastry bag, so I used a ziploc bag instead to pipe into oil.  I had no problems at all.

These were GREAT!  I should have doubled the recipe because it turned out they were not enough, hehe.  Make sure you fry them till they are a golden brown, they don't come out as chewy.  I used my Pampered Chef Easy Accent Decorator with the largest flower tip attachment, they were thin but they were so yummy and cute!  Also, if you don't mess with them until they are ready to be turned, they shouldn't fall apart.

I have not tried this yet but in Brazil where I am from we add a caramel filling to this. To do that just make a whole in the center with a bamboo skier and pipe caramel. To make autentic 'dulce de leche, cook an unopened can of condensed milk in boiling water fot 90 to 120 minutes. Let it cool before using it.

These are splendid.  I used a pastry bag but beware, the dough is hot and my bag split in the middle of squeezing them in the hot greese. An electric skillit / fryer would be best to keep a constant temp.  I hand rolled some but they were not nearly as good as the ones I used with the pastry bag. I used a wilton #25 but need one a bit bigger. You must work quickly as the dough will go cement quickly. Also be sure to wash up your bowl and dough tools ASAP.

These are very good, but just remember to pipe them very thin or you'll end up with raw insides and burned outside!

These churros were so delicious, they taste better then what we used to get as kids when we spent the day at Olvera Street in LA... and I always thought those were the best.  These were perfect!  Crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.  I'm going to use this recipe all the time, thanks for the great recipe I was so very pleasantly suprised, it's a very simple recipe but it's results are so great and authentic.

This was a really good recipe.  My kids loved them. You can't handle too much and needs to be used asap or it will break apart while frying.

What a fun and delicious treat for my kids.  A little tricky to make, as you really do have to let the batter cool a little before putting in the piping bag.  I had to double bag mine in order for the batter to not melt through.  I agree with others that it's better to pipe all of them on parchment paper, and then just add them to the oil a few at a time.  Piping them directly into the oil did not work for me.  I immediately rolled them in the cinnamon sugar mixture to make sure it stuck and they were well coated.  My kids were so thrilled.  The only problem is that now they expect me to make these on a regular basis.

These were pretty good except they were much tougher than churros I've bought. I didn't overmix but they ended up chewy. I also had to make sure I didn't make them too thick because my first batch wasn't cooked all the way through. My kids liked them though.

I followed recipe exactly, except I didn't have a pastry bag and my ziplock kept breaking. So I rolled into shape and fried, perfect. These were light and fluffy and just like I had been longing for!!!

If your churros are burning on the outside while still doughy on the inside, try lowering your heat.  The longer they are in the oil, the better they will cook inside without burning outside,  they will still be crispy.  I use my beef jerky making kit.   It comes with a tool like a caulking gun,  you remove the tube,  feed the seasoned beef, in this case, the dough and press the trigger to pipe out the dough.  This kit comes with 3 attachments,  small tube,  large tube and flat tube.  Works wonderfully.

I spent a few hours preparing a Mexican style dinner for my family from scratch and realized I neglected dessert. This was EXCELLENT! Very simple to make with very few ingredients. My 6 year old daughter told me to make these everyday! To others who have stated the dough is still raw on the inside, turn your oil down! It's cooking too quickly on the outside giving you the impression it's done. Slow and steady and you'll get a perfect golden color.

5 plus plus plus!  These were wonderful!  I used a large pastry bag and a large star tip.  I can't imagine trying to pipe the stiff dough from a ziploc with very good results.   If the oil is right at 350* (I thought 375* was too high) they fry up nice and golden and not doughy at all inside.  Thanks so much for a GREAT recipe!

Based on the reviews and the couple of minor adjustments suggested by Cat, I made this recipe with just 2 TBSP sugar and 1 TBSP oil, otherwise everything else is the same.  The sugar/cinnamon coating is way more than you need for one batch, so cut it back to 1/4 to avoid waste and shake warm Churros in a paper bag to coat.  I also used the large star tip on Pampered Chef Easy Accent Decorator and had the perfect Churros.  If you pump them out onto an icing spatula and then turn them into the oil, they hold their shape beautifully.  Excellent recipe!

I followed the recipe EXACTLY and I used a ziploc for a pastry bag, I really dont know what went wrong, maybe it was too thick but I was standing over the frying oil and one of the churro's exploded!! I have an extreme burn on my hand (it has covered almost half of my right hand) with a big blister and a blister on my forhead, when I ran to put my hand under cold water another one of the churros in the pan popped also.
Im not sure, It may be a good recipe but I will NEVER EVER make it again.
I have to deal with a burned hand for at least a few months until its all well again, but be very very very careful if you want to make this

This is a really great recipe....for funnel cake.  I tried it twice and everyone agreed that it wasn't bad, but it wasn't churro either.  I think I'll keep looking.

These delicious little snacks were AMAZING!!! They had the best flavor and they are cheep and easy to make. I used a spritz cookie squeeze instead of a pastry bag and it worked out great if not better! This is so because once the dough is mixed it is still hot from being on the stove and had i used a pastry bag it would have been to hot to handle. So i just put one of the long attatchments on and it made beautiful mini churros. The only down side is that the deep-frying makes them soggy if they sit overnight, so if you can make them the day of. Otherwise they were so delicious and easy to make!

These came out great! Much easier than I thought it would be. The dough was pretty firm so instead of making a  mess with a pipping bag or plastic bag I just rolled them into balls. Tasted just like a churro!

This recipe was easy to make. The churro when fried is still a little gooey, but other wise is very delicious. Just a tip: make sure you roll into sugar and cinnamon right away or it doesn't stick. Good, very good.

We had these for breakfast and they were delicious. I used the cut off ziploc bag trick too, and it worked just fine. I let the dough cool slightly before putting it in the bag, and I added about 1/4 cup more water (the dough was a bit too stiff to squeeze the first time). As a result, my churros were crispy outside and soft on the inside--perfect!

I made this exactly according to the directions and they turned out great!!  Some people said they were doughy in the middle---that's how churros are supposed to be!!  That's why you add the flour to boiling water, causing it to gelatinize.  Also, I used my instant-read probe thermometer to maintain oil temperature.  Cooking in oil that is too cool or too hot will cause them to come out bad.  Very quick and easy to make.  Heating the oil to proper temperature took longer than actually making the churros.  I will definitely make these again...and again!

I read the reviews before making these and I took the tip someone had about reducing the sugar to 1 tbs. and the oil to 1 tbs.   I did not have a pastry bag and the dough was too heavy to pipe from a sandwich bag (it kept busting the seam of the plastic bag.) ... I decided to just roll it between my palms as one would do with play-doh and made "snakes". Those cooked up just fine and the dough was easy to handle.  Some of the churros I rolled in cinnamon and sugar, and some just sugar, (as I have a family member who doesn't like cinnamon.) - They all came out fantastic. They weren't as lightweight and airy as churros I bought from street vendors in San Diego, but they were close enough to satisfy the craving.   Other reviewers suggestions to double the recipe should be heeded. These were disappearing as quickly as I put the finished ones on the plate. (I even burnt the roof of my mouth because they were still really hot - so let them cool a little, as difficult as that may be!)

This is a great recipe! I made it for my Spanish class, and they were very tasty. I followed the recipe exactly, making churros about four or five inches, and it yielded about fifteen per batch.

I made this recipe twice. My first trial was a bit chewy (although some came out crunchy). My husband (whose sweet tooth can't be trusted) was delighted with the first attempt. My 2nd trial was "better"- I baked them (was feeling too guilty for having churros for the 2nd time in a week). I doubled the ingredients but only added 2 tbs of sugar. The reason for the 4 stars is because the recipe doesn't say how thick they should be (I have no churreria), for the churros to come out more crunchy and less chewy. I will try next time to add less oil as another reviewer noted and see if it helps with crunchiness. I had it with Chocolate a la taza (the thick Spanish chocolate served in all Spain). Mmmm, delicioso.

These were really easy to make but, were not that good. I may try to make them again, and make them a bit thinner.

Am I missing something or is the recipe?  I made these last night and they are tough . I think that the recipe is missing the 3 eggs  that need to be stirred into the ball.  After making these and then trying a second batch, there was NO WAY I could pipe them through a pastry tube.  Too thick.  I am going to try again with the three eggs.  I checked with other recipes and sure enough , they all had eggs in the batter.

YUMMY!  So easy and simple to make!  This is the perfect ending for a Cinco de Mayo meal.  I used a 13MM star tip and piped a 4-5 inch strip into the hot oil.  I fried them four at a time in my "Fry Daddy".  They floated to the top as they cooked and browned nicely.  The dough was so nice to work with.  Once drained on paper towels, I put them in a bowl of sugar and cinnamon with a lid and shook gently.  They are absolutely YUMMY!  Thank you Delia for sharing your recipe!

These taste great!! and so simple to make. Only change I made was to add 1 tsp of vanilla. I made 3 batches last night...my son and nephew kept eating them up. The largest star tip I have was still making them pencil thin, so I just rolled mine into long strips and shaped into doughnuts, worked out great! Thanks for sharing...now my family can enjoy anytime!

looks delicious but as an advise, never use a pastry bad for churros, there is an special device for doing it, cos with the pastry bag churros may explode and with very hot oil is very dengerous. once in my country , where churros are very popular, a magazine gave a recipe with a pastry bag and many churros exploded and the people sue the magazine and won...pastry bag put so many air inside the dough , taht why is so dangerous

This is a great, easy recipe for churros.  We make them for a Cinco de Mayo party every year and instead of making them long we make them about 1 1/2" bite size pieces.  That way everyone gets some to enjoy.  Serve them with melted chocolate...Yum!

OMG!!!I just made these and I am eating them as I type and I absolutely love this recipe. Super easy to make and the best result ever. I have tried other recipes before and none compare to this one . I have to say for those of you that don't own a thermometer to check the temperature do what I do which is I take the back of a wooden spoon and dip it in the oil , if little bubbles surround the end of your spoon then oil is hot and ready. Highly recommend this to everyone!

The churros reminded me of my life in mexico with my pet turtle and how we used to eat them together(he loevd the cinnamon chunks)We would make them every Tuesaday night but he would NEVER do the work so it was quite time consuming since I was the only one cooking. The only thing that he would do, by the way his names Ron, is kneed the dough a lot with his paws and i found that it was always better when he did it. Wow, thinking about this has made me miss the old days under the mango trees in Mexico. Ron and I, looking into the distance, into the mango tinted sunset. Wow.

this is a great recipe. i would definetly do this. although don't use as much oil its wasteful. use like 3 cups or less and only put in 3 churros at a time. the churros may look boring without ridges but they sure do taste good! :)

My daughter made this recipe for a class project. She said they were a big hit. They were devoured by the class. She said the greatest compliment she received was when someone in class held up a churro and yelled "WHO MADE THIS RECIPE?".

These are so easy and delicious!  I have a suggestion for those that had trouble with the pastry bag - use a cookie press!  Mine comes with icing tips too, so I used the largest star tip and just squeezed the handle three or four times (holding it in the air) until it was the right length, then broke off the dough and laid it in the oil.  It worked wonderfully and was easy on my hand (this dough is very firm so I can see how twisting a pastry bag would get tiring).  The only downside is my churros were a little on the skinny side b/c my star tip wasn't as big as I would have liked but they were polished off in no time and tasted great!

These tasted pretty good, and were fairly easy to make.  My only problem was I used the Pampered Chef cookie press.  I've discovered it was not meant for churros!  They were too fat and not long enough.  I would definitely make this again, but I think I'd go with something else to squirt the dough into the oil.

These were delicious!  We added 1 tsp. of vanilla for a little extra flavor.  They worked great in the pastry bag, but you can also roll it out with your hands if you don't have a pastry bag.

DELICIOUS!  i took cat's advice and cut both the sugar and oil in the dough down to 1 tbs each. i didn't feel like dirtying my pastry bag so i rolled out "fingers" with the palms of my hands (much easier than i thought it was going to be, the dough looked very sticky but it actually wasn't!).  after frying & draining the oil i popped them in a plastic bag with the sugar and cinnamon. shake, shake, shake... et voilet!  fair food in your own home! thanks for a great recipe!

Be careful with this one, you really have to get the timing down when you fry them because they will come out too crispy or too mushy if you don't get it just right. But when you get it down, they are really authentic tasting. Take it from me-- I live right by the border!

I made these into little balls instead of trying to pipe them, and they came out very cute looking. I used a deep fryer, so they came out perfectly. The only change I made to the recipe was adding 1/2 tsp of vanilla for a bit of flavor. Very tasty, and everyone liked them.

Unbelieveably easy! I made it several times as written--delicious. Then I reduced the oil and sugar (for the dough) to 1 tablespoon each as suggested by one of the reviewers. The texture was even better!  I used a pastry bag and a cake decorating tip (Wilton 1M).

I found these easy enough to make.  I found that I had to add more flour then what it called for.  Before I added extra flour it stuck to the bottem of the pan.  I think I will also make them smaller next time, maybe even make them into balls (breaking out of the traditional shape).  I found the inside to be very doughy.  I also found it easier to knead the dough a bit and to shape it with my hands.

these were good and crunchy but I had to use the smallest attatchment in my pastry bag to get them to fully cook.  I will definately be making them over and over.

super fast, easy and DELICIOUS
although we must all be mindful, churros are just a mix of poison which we fry and sprinkle with a bit more poison

These are incredible!  And so easy!  I mixed the wet with the dry ingredients until just combined, trying not to overwork it.  It came together very quickly.  I was imaging these to be quite a bit longer than I ended up making them, but I found it a lot easier to make them a tad shorter- about two bites in length (how's that for a measuring system?!)  The first two I made came out a bit tough, but I determined that was due to my oil not being hot enough, thus they cooked longer than they should have.  After I adjusted the temp of the oil, I was busting these bad boys out like a pro.  They are crispy on the outside, yet moist and tender on the inside.  And, a true testament to how good they are, they are even yummy cold!  (Although hot is best, of course!).  I followed this recipe as written, and it was a raging success!  Thanks Delia- this was, and will again be, the perfect afternoon snack  :)

These were sooo easy and sooo good!  I made one recipe as-is and it was plenty for my family of 4.  I just used a plastic ziploc bag and cut the corner.  My first batch came out about as thick as my ring finger--I thought they were a little doughy on the inside.  So I cut the other side of the corner of the baggie smaller and they were more the size of McDonald's french fries.  I thought the smaller ones were better--no doughy middle.  That said, my family ate all of them with no complaints!

These did not turn out so good, the dough was too thick and did not cook all the way through.  The outside would burn while the inside was raw.  Epic fail.

Just tried this recipe and wow, these are great! The dough is very hot so I let it cool for about 5 mins and wrapped my piping bag in a dish towel. Since it is almost play-dough like I just piped them on to a cutting board and then put them into the oil. Worked perfectly.

These are easy to make and taste really good!  I had no problems with cooking them because I used a thermometer to make sure my oil was the temp stated.  I used a 1M star tip and cooked them for about 5 minutes total turning them halfway though.  They will turn out delicious if you cook them right!!!

Excellent! I made a double batch 1 for the family and one for my Daughters Spanish class. Needless to say they were all eaten. My daughter even argued with me that she needed more for her class all the while eating out of her batch.

I used a Ziploc bag instead of a pastry bag. I had problems with the  bag blowing out like others have noted. I started out making pencil thin churros but as the bag split open more they ended up more like cigars. The pencil size was our favorite.

I was very disappointed. I used this recipe in a kids camp cooking class. It was a flop. The dough comes out way too thick. We had to roll balls because it was too thick to squeeze from a piping bag. I will never waste my time with this recipe again.

Those are totally tasty! I have never done churros before and this recipe totally worked. Just be sure to use as many paper towels as possible to drain them. I made funny spirals out of dough but they were to hard to turn. The recipe is great, even my very picky husband loved it!

This recipe is wonderful!  Since, the directions and the list of ingredients showed different amounts, I had to choose what to do!  I chose to follow the amounts listed in the directions, and was well rewarded.  I only made one change, and that was to use 1/2 cup whole wheat flour (that I ground at home) as well as 3/4 cup white flour.  The results were so good, that I had to guard the last few churros from my children so my husband could have a taste of them when he got home from work!  Next time I will double the recipe!!
To form the dough I used my Pampered Chef Easy Accent Decorator.  It handled the consistancy of the dough very well.  I tried both the small star tip and the large star tip.  The large star tip worked better and was easier to use.  I was able to squeeze the dough out with one hand and to cut the dough with a butter knife using my other hand.  Fast, easy and delicious!!

Yummy!!! These churros are quite easy to make but most of all DELICIOUS...My husband told me that they were addicting and couldn't help but to eat another one.  My 2 yr. old son kept helping himself to more and I was impressed how GOOD they came out.

I liked this recipe because I'd never made churros before and it was very simple.  On the other hand I didn't have a fryer so I used a stew pot to fry them in the oil.  This was a problem.  The oil got really hot and burned the churros without fully cooking them.  I ended up keeping the heat on medium and the churros cooked slower and lighter.  They cooked inside and were not too hard.  The key was to cook them until they were a light color.  My churros came out thin maybe about 1/4 inch around in circumfrence.  Perfect for watching the waist!  I used a pastry bag during my test run  because you can choose how long you want them.  The second time I used a cookie press.  The problem was they came out shorter than I wanted, about 3 inches long.  Nice for kids!  I liked them about 5-6 inches in length.  I didn't do anything special to the recipe except follow it and instead of adding all of the flour I only added enough so the dough wasn't too sticky to pipe through the pastry bag.  When I made them for the actual event I doubled the recipe.  That was more difficult because the dough began getting hard which makes it tough to get through the pastry bag.  Everyone who had one said they were really good!  And yes I did roll them in cinnamon and sugar!

Great recipe!  I used a pampered chef piper and used about a 3/4 inch end and they turned out perfect.  Not too doughy in the middle and perfect golden brown on the outside.

Unfortunately, these didn't turn out so well as written and I wished I had found some changes to be made.  I have a very precise fryer, and after gently preparing the dough and carefully piping it into hot oil (I got 8 churros out of this recipe) I ended up with 8 little bricks that were raw on the inside.  You can tell the flavor would be good if only they'd cook all the way, and the exterior was nice and crispy, hence the two stars.  I just wish there was more detail in the instructions, and I'm a very experienced cook.

Great recipe...I listened to others and reduced the sugar and oil in the recipe to 1 tablespoon each, and it was absolutely perfect!  My grandmother was Spanish and would make churros on the first cold night of the year, it was a family tradition, and these were the exact same flavor!  Thank you for sharing!

Really, really good. A couple of minor changes: I added a tablespoon or two more of water and I mixed the hot liquids with the flour until just barely combined enough to make a sticky ball (in fact there were tiny flour clumps still there but they disappeared when I was piping). I think over-mixing would make it more of a chewy texture and so mine were how I prefer them, crispy on the outside and very soft on the inside. I also added some vanilla and a tiny pinch of nutmeg into the dough just to give it some more flavor. Lastly, it took me a while to get the oil just right. I found that 375 was too hot and it was browning too fast without cooking thoroughly on the inside so i reduced it to 330-350 approx (med heat) and they were perfect. Piping them on the thinner side also helped cook them evenly. Everyone loved them and I will definitely make them again soon.

This recipe was very simple and easy to make! I received a lot of compliments on my Churros. I did not have a pastry bag, but I used a freezer bag and cut the corner of the bag and it worked the same exact way as a pastry bag.

I regret making these...We ate them all, before they even made it to the table. Wow, they were crazy delicious!
We rolled some by hand in ball shape, thick tube, thin tube, squeezed some through a pipe really really thin. My favorite (and what came out best with crunchy outside, light soft inside) was the thin hand rolled ones and the thicker tube piped ones. It took a couple tries to figure out what shade of light brown was best. But every last one of these was totally awesome! Will be saving this recipe!

I attempted to bake these, which didn't result in the correct texture. Flavor and cinnamon sugar are right on!

No matter what I did these wouldn't cook all the way through. The outside was delicious. Too bad they were doughy in the centers.

Quick and easy to put together.  I did add the seeds from one split vanilla bean for a little added touch.  My kids loved these.  I served them with two dipping sauces, dark chocolate and homemade dulce de leche.  Big hit here in the Bebout house!!

Fantastic!!!!!!!!!!  Much easier than donuts, and so tasty!  I followed the recommendations on decreasing the sugar and oil, and doubled the recipe.  Next time I'll have to make even more.  These will disappear way too fast!

I found this recipe a while back while I was in college. Had a sweet tooth and no money, but I had these simple ingredients in the pantry. All my poor college friends loved them. Easy to make, and I don't fuss with them being more/less chewy or more/less brown, the inconsistency makes it fun... like eating a bunch of grapes... but unhealthy! haha

Am I missing something here? Water & flour, regardless of how they're mixed, makes... GLUE. I played around with this recipe a lot & just think it's horrible. The batter needs something else, eggs a riser, I don't know.

I took another reviewer's advice and cut the sugar to 1 Tbl and oil to 1 Tbl. I used a ziploc bag with one corner cut off to pipe the dough and it worked well. This only took about ten minutes and was incredibly easy.

First time ever making churros and follow the recipe exactly; they turned out perfectly!!! These were so easy to make, the flavor was so good and the texture was perfect. Some reviewers wrote they are crunchy inside and out, not the case here, mine turned out night and soft in the inside. The shape of mine was a little off, mainly at the lack of nice pastry bag tips, but that didn't matter, they were gone in a few minutes. Doubling the recipe next time. Thanks for the recipe!

I didn't have a pastry bag, so I simply rolled them out by hand and dropped the churros into the oil. Delicious!

Difficult to get the inside done while keeping the outside from burning. I heard hollowing the Churros out with a stick before frying might work better, makes sense. Otherwise tasty and easy enough.

It came out delicious!!! My husband loved it! I didn't have pastry bag nor ziploc bag so I ended up sing my hands to form straight vertical line. I also made a 'donut" form churros:) I mixed cinnamon and sugar and it is delicious!

These must be rolled thin.  Don't try to make these the thickness you see at fairs or the inside's will be "raw."  Overall it was a great recipe, and was the only fried desert that worked out at a "fryer party" my friends had to use the fryer they got for their wedding.

I made the recipe word-for-word. I tried using the largest star tip I had, which was an Ateco 2D. It was a closed star tip, and it did not work at all. The pieces fell apart in the hot oil. For my second batch I switched to a large round tip and piped 2-inch long pieces. (I got 24 pieces altogether.) They stick together in the oil, so only fry a few at a time, depending on how large your pot is. When they float to the top, fry them for 1-2 minutes longer, or until they are golden brown. I'll definitely be making these again!

This was my first time making these. My 12 year old opted out of trick or treating this year for a homemade treat of his choosing and these are what he chose. Yes, it took alittle while to get them to him because I was so paranoid that I wouldn't be able to make them sucessfully! These were so easy to make. The dough came together well. Did take longer to cook then I expected but there's always something to catch up on in the kitchen while you wait! I did have the bright idea to used my Pampered Checf "decorator" because one of the tips was the perfect size. WARNING - DO NOT DO THIS!!! I was chugging along just fine ( I made a double batch) when the entire plastic cylinder popped off and into the oil :( I don't know if the dough just started getting too hard or the heat from being over the oil was not a good idea but I only got about 1/3 of the churros I was hoping for.  Told my son I will make them again :) I think I will stick to a churro that is about 1/2 inch in diameter because after the outside browns there is a little bit of cake (?) in the center, not too much to be too much :)

After trying to make these churros and burning my hand when trying to pipe them, I decided I would make them into "churro balls." These were a great hit with my husband and kids. I made them for my co-workers and they really enjoyed them as well!

These were very good! My daughter told me at 6pm she needed to bring in any kind of spanish food to school in the morning. I had all of the ingredients for this one, so it was the obvious choice. They were very tasty and a hit in her class. Great recipe!

My mom used to make churros when we were kids that tasted just like these.  They were sweet and crispy on the outside with a chewy inside.  Not only were they delicious they were actually easy to make.  I made them for my 7 year old who LOVES churros and he was so impressed that he said we should never ever buy these again, we should just make them at home.  thank you for the great recipe!

Very difficult to cook through without burning, and I made really thin ones. It also called for way too much flour.

Really good recipe & other reviews were helpful.  Used 1/4 tsp. of salt instead of recipes 1/2 tsp.  I used a Wilton star tip #21 and a decorating bag.  It took a few tries to get it right, but they were really good. :)  Using them to add in a favor bag for a wedding. Thanks.

My son and I just finished making a double recipe for his spanish class.(It made about 48 small ones). It took about an hour from start to finish. I used a cookie press and it worked very well. They taste just like the ones we got from a street vender in Mexico!

After reading all the reviews, I decided smaller was best.  I used a frosting bag with no tip.  Then piped out french fry size strips. I also used a candy thermometer and kept the temp at 375.  They were great.  I'm taking them to a "cico de mayo" party tonight.

A breeze to make for the experienced chef, but be careful not to light the oil on fire.

We gave this recipe 3 Stars mainly because the churro process was not as easy as stated.  Making the dough was a snap; rolling the dough into a pleasing shape and having the sugar stick after the frying was another thing.  My 10 year old daughter and I were making these for her Spanish party, and they didn't turn out as good as we had hoped.  Just as in other reviews, the dough was so thick and heavy that it split the pastry bag.  We attempted to use ziplock bags (double bags) which also didn't work well.  Finally, we hand-rolled 5 inch sections.  After draining, the sugar did not stick easily to the churro either.  I had to drizzle the churros lightly with butter in order for the sugar/cinnamon mixture to stick.  The taste was fine, but the appearance was not what we hoped.  We plan to look at other recipes and play around until we master one.  Thanks for the recipe.

I loved this recipe first timer and my husband loves them. Pretty easy and i learned temperature is key to the dough. Only issue it wad hard to squeeze out of the pastry bag. Note: learn to milk a cow before using the pastry bag lol my husband had to squeeze them out on parchment paper for me.... love it and its going in the book!

I doubled the batch, thank goodness, because everyone couldn't stop eating them!  My nephew went on and on about how awesome they were and kept thanking me for making them.  I used my Fry Daddy to cook them...very quick and simple.

These churros ( made with the lower sugar and lower oil as per the suggestions) were perfect...just like I remember them in Spain.  I tend to like the oil temperature a bit higher than 375 to get them a bit crisper. Too low a temperature makes them heavy and oily. I prefer them unsugared with chocolate (melted chocolate and whipping cream was the closest I could get to what they serve in Spain). Made them small for a tasting party for my daughter's grade 2 class. They were a hit!

Yum! These tasted just like the ones I remember having growing up at the old Mexican restaurant that was in my hometown.
I made as is - the dough was much too thick to be piped thru my star tip for the pastry bag, so I just took it off and used the bag with no tip, which yielded Churros that look like cheese poofs...but that's OK, they still tasted amazing. My only problem was that they never got to the golden brown color. They cooked enough and were done in the middle. I believe that because I deep fried them over an induction cooktop that the oil was heated very evenly and prevented the browning or burning. I'll definitely make these again. My kids ate them up!

Made them for the first time and I could not keep my daughter from stealing them!  I used a cookie press, but they did not come out straight..I next time I will pipe it to an icing tool (as one other person suggested)...but my little churro "J"s still tasted really good!

These reminded me of the churros you can get from the fair or carnival... very good.. using a pastry bag is  definitely a good idea it gives them a great presentation and makes this easier... just make sure you like the dough cool slightly before putting it in the bag... mine stretch out out the bag a squeezed the tip right out.. otherwise these turned out wonderful... not exactly the healthiest but that's why they are fair food.. another note I cut the sugar and cinnamon in half and had just the right amount

Great recipe! FYI for those who care, Churros are NOT a Mexican pastry, they're originally from Spain where my descendants are from and i don't get why mexicans claim it as theirs like they do many other foods.

AH-friggen-MAZING!!!!! Made these last for the first time. Was kind of hesitant because some of the bad reviews, but they were far beyond what I was expecting!! Had some friends over tonight, so we doubled the recipe, and they all went! One of our friends is Mexican, and a tough Mexican food critic, even he couldn't believe how amazing they were!

Awesome! Just don't attempt these without a pipping bag and star tip. I couldn't find my tips so i used a ziplock and it could have been better if i would have done it right.

I decreased the sugar to 1 1/2 Tb and the oil for the dough to 1 Tb. I didn't have a pastry bag so I used a ziplock bag and cut the corner. Let the mixture cool a little or the bag will rip. They were the best churros I've ever had!

Kids say I'm the coolest mom ever!!!
These churros were awesome and very easy after a couple "test churros" for the correct size and thickness. BTW they tasted just as good as the rest!
Made it just like the recipe minus 1 tbsp of sugar in the dough. This well definitely be made many more times in the years to come. Kids loved making them!

The flavor of these is great. But, they were hard and crunchy from the outside to the center. I wish the directions said about how long they normally cook? They don't brown quickly and are actually quite delicate in the oil and will break easily at first. Regardless, I believe they should have been removed before they are slightly golden. It would have also been helpful to know what pastry tip is best. I didn't expect them to grow almost 50% after they hit the oil so that is important. If piping them out a pastry bag is neccessary. The dough is so thick it will break a ziplock plastic bag. I got 15 about 3" sized churros. We ate a few and tossed the rest, because they were just too hard. Don't know what happened, I followed the recipe exactly and used a thermometer.

These were actually really good. I did have a hard time cooking them properly. The outside would be thick and crunchy, where as the inside was still gooey. But overall still delicious! The only change I made was I added approx. 1/2 - 1 tsp of vanilla to one of my batches. That by far was the best batch out of the 4 that I made.

Mine were raw on the inside. They were chewy but not in a good way. They tasted real good though, but then again, they were covered with sugar and cinnammon! I don't know where I went wrong or what I did different than the rest.. I followed the recipe exactly. I even repeated it and added more flour to take away the chewiness but the mixture got all sticky even when I kept adding more and more flour! I had to throw it away and start over again and ended right where I started: Raw churros.. which by the way were horrible next morning!

These were good, but didn't turn out perfectly for me......maybe I had the oil too hot, i'm not sure.  But even after frying these for a long time, they didn't cook enough in the middle.  Then I microwaved them to cook a bit more (3 minutes maybe?) and they got all spongey on me:(  These tasted good when freshly done, besides being a tad undercooked.  Thank you Delia!!!

How can something deep fried, crispy, chewy, and covered in cinnamon and sugar be bad?!?!  They were delicious!

But we did run into a few problems:

1) We used the biggest star tip we could find, and it made skinny, wimpy, twig-like churros.  

2) We couldn't get the dough to lie straight, so we wound up with a bunch of J-shaped churros.

Thank goodness they tasted much better than they looked.

I Loved these I made them for a food culture dinner where everyone made something from somewhere else. I made churro bites by cutting the dough into small sections that where bite size. They where the first thing gone.

These were delicious! I found the recipe today and made them today.  I had read other reviews about the pastry bag being hot, so I bought a cupcake decorator from Target that had a star tip. It took some strength to push the dough through, but in the end these churros looked and tasted like the kind they sell at fairs and carnivals... and Disneyland and Magic Mountain!

this a very good likeness of the real things. Where I'm from n Evansville, In, they serve them with Chocolate or caramel sauce. It is heavenly. I live in Arkansas now but go to get them everytime I'm in Evansville. The chocolate is kinda like Hersheys chocolate. It's runny. But OMG it is so good.

Very easy and delicious.   I made the dough rolled out the strips by hand earlier in the day and cooked them later.   Even without a proper fryer they cooked perfectly.

Used my hands to roll dough strips into a breadstick shape, then pinched in between my fingers to make the dough 4 sided.  If it's too thin it will break apart in oil. Loved it! Very good

I always wanted to make these! I really liked the flavor and it was super easy to do! It was gobbled up in no time! Had some left over cinnamon and sugar though. Next time, I'd cut down how much sugar I used to coat them. Maybe instead of rolling them in the sugar mixture, I'll sprinkle it lightly over top. Also, I made small thin ones that were yummy and crunchy, but they ended up curling up while cooking in the oil. I wonder if I make them bigger if they'll stay straight. But overall a great recipe..definitely a keeper!!

I didn't change the ingredients.  I rolled them and made them the length of my ring finger and it only made 15.  Fried for about 6 minutes.  It is like the one at six flags except I wish I had a tool to pipe the nutella in it.  Instead we just dunked them.  Still good.  next time I'll double the batch bec this was enough for only 3 people.

I tried this recipe with my daughter who loves churros and ate many in Spain. Although the dough was easy to make, the churros did not cook in the middle, even after cooking for a long time. Also, they had no flavor.  I would not recommend this recipe to anyone.

Love churros and these were great.  I didn't have a piping bag, so I just spooned in some into small lumps and dropped them into the hot oil.  Took the advice of some other reviewers and added less oil and less sugar, but it still browned quite quickly therefore not cooking all the way through the middle, with that said, we still demolished them all, the flavour and texture was still good.  Will try again and see if I can fry them at a slightly lower heat    for longer.

Good home-made churro recipe! I used a ziploc bag to pipe the churros out and made them thinner than the ones sold at restaurants. Then, I cooked them until they were golden brown and rolled them in the cinnamon sugar on a small paper plate. They came out perfect!

These were absolutely wonderful! I expected them to be difficult to make, but they were incredibly easy! They are a bit heavier than we were used to compared to the local Mexican resturant, however, my family all said they preferred this recipe to the "lighter, fluffier" version!  5 stars in my book, I'll definately be making these again, and sharing this recipe with friends!

I just made this recipe to test before serving at my party tomorrow.  My husband and daughter loved them.  I followed the recipe exactly and the Churros came out great.  I do suggest that you have someone to help with dipping the churros in the sugar and cinnamon while they are hot, so you can continue to cook the next batch of churros.

The recipe in itself is great, my dough came out perfectly and I was very impressed.  If using a pot to fry in, be sure to bring the oil to a boil while making the dough, then lower the heat while maintaining a 375 degree boil.  My pastry bag bit the dust before the dough even came out, so I shaped them by hand.  Endearing and authentic look this way!  I grew up in Brazil, so I had to fill them with Doce de Leite (caramelized sweetened condensed milk).  This was street food where I grew up and it brough back memories!

Very yummy and easy!  I added an extra 1/2 tsp. salt to the dough and used my cookie press.  Instead of cooling the churro on a paper towel, I immediately put it in a pie plate with cinnamon sugar and sprinkled more cinnamon sugar on top.  It seemed to stick better that way.

Fabulous recipe!  We were looking for something to sell with coffee for a church fundraiser and we tried 3 different recipes and this one was the best, according to 4 taste testers.  We rolled some in sweetened cocoa for a coffee taste.  I will let everyone know how they sell

This was super easy!  I used my cookie press also to form the dough.  The warm dough broke two icing/decorator bags before I learned though. A candy thermometer is really a useful tool with this recipe.  My oil was exactly the right temp and the churros came out perfectly!  Good recipe!

Tasted good, but very doughy.  You must use a very small pastry tip for these.

Just made these gluten free & have to agree they are very tasty & pretty easy! If you reduce the temp of oil you will get a crunchy-ier texture. Which we prefer. Having read previous comments we reduced the oil & sugar by 1tbsp. 
Making them gluten free we used half a cup of self-raising gf mix, half a cup of brown rice flour & a tsp of xanthum gum.
Worked perfectly!
We found the cinnamon & sugar a bit sickly so dusted with vanilla sugar & used a dip of thick maple syrup as son allergic to dairy. He was amazed he could eat them! 
Best advice I can give is to pipe these onto a marble surface first. Allow a minute for them to settle then pop into the oil. You can cook more this way & keep them moving through the oil without them sticking to each other.
Finally, I found that piping them into small round balls with the star nozzle made a really cute & tasty type of doughnut bite. We all preferred this shape. (So basically pipe onto marbled surface as if you were icing the top of a cupcake, give it a minute & then pop 7-8 of them all in the pan at once. Keep the oil heat bubbling around them, but low enough to get a crispy outside & soft fluffy inner. The star nozzle gives beautiful detail to the outside & picks up your desired flavouring well too!)

These turned out great. As some of the comments suggested I used less sugar and oil in the actual batter. I used 1.5 tbsp of sugar and 1 tbsp oil. I used 1.5 quarts of oil, but that was due to the pot size. They were crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.

This DID NOT work. I ended up with a burnt outside and a raw inside. Obviously inedible. I would give it 0 stars if I could. I just want to know why it didn't work for me.

The recipe is great and they were chewy the first time around because of the fast cooking but in order to fix the chewiness I flattened them to give them more time to cook on the inside

They fell apart right earn you put it in the friar, both froze, just cold, and warm dough did the same thing and turned into small fried hard and crunchy bits of nothing.

So everytime I want to make something, I look at the comments first. From the comments I got lots of great advice. I changed the recipe using some tips from the comments, and they turned out great! I doubled the recipe (Next time it's gonna be tripled!) since there are more than three people in this house. I actually came across this recipe because I didn't have eggs at the time, and every recipe said you needed eggs. To cut the chewiness, make it 1 tbs. oil in the batter, unless you're doubling then keep it the same. Same with the sugar. The sugar makes it brown faster, even if it isn't fully cooked. The batter was quite thick, so it probably won't work with ziplocks as well. if it's too hard to handle, add a teeny bit of oil or water. So if you're making one batch, split it in half.  All the mistakes that happened with me where my own fault, not the recipe. Yet it still turned out perfecto! I recommened eating with ice cream, or dipping them in chocolate sauce, or even caramel sauce! Mmmmm! I gave these a four star only because you have to change a few things to get it perfect, otherwise, yummy!

Followed the recipe to the T, but the outside would always cook  but the inside would remain in its doughy form.  No matter how much I adjusted the temperature the inside would not cook.  Very disappointed in the recipe and would not recommend.

These were amazing. I used Olive Oil instead of Vegetable Oil and they still turned out great, I also just used a zip lock bag and there was no difference. No need to go out and buy a fancy pastry bag :) Will definitely make again.

I followed recipe as is. Make sure temp is between 350 and 375. I used a star shaped cookie press. The middle was perfect and the outside crispy. Seriously delicious! I had no issues! I had to triple the recipe and it made a little over a dozen.

It's great! Based on what I did however, it did not look very appealing. I had to make a makeshift pastry bag, so if you don't have a pastry bag I would roll them out on a cookie sheet then put them in oil

I made these last week and they came out almost perfect! I only had a cake decorating star tip so they came out thin and small. They cooked and browned really quick so I would watch them and try to get the right tip so they dont burn or overcook

Really delicious! Very nice crisp on the outside and not chewy and undercooked on the inside. Absolutely perfect. I made them about finger length and cooked until golden brown all over. One batch made plenty at that length! Delicious!

Loved it. Easy to work up, weird to work with hot dough though! Some were hit or miss because I do not own a deep fryer so the temp varies but still amazing.

I made them too thick and the inside was not quite baked.  Nevertheless, they are good but not as good as most you can buy at a restaurant.

These did not last long in our home.  2 parents and 4 kids had then all gone in a few minutes.  The recipe was super easy to follow.  Only recommendation, make sure you let the dough cool down before you put it into a plastic pastry bag or do what I did- made one out of parchment paper.  This will be something I will make again and again.

Wonderful. Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  I ended up rolling them on the counter since my ziplock bag tore.  Experimented with fat ones and skinny ones, both yummy and cooked through with out burning.  I will make again, satisfied my craving!GRACIAS!!

I'm glad I didn't double the batch or I would have eaten 2 batches! Very good! I did the recipe exactly as stated. I did use a gallon sized, plastic, twist tie bag to squeeze them out. Next time I'll try cutting the hole smaller, maybe where they are only about .5"-.75" in diameter. Mine were way too big the first time, but still very good. I heated the oil before mixing the batter so that it was ready. I had no problems with the batter being too hot or splitting my bag. Also, I put my sugar and cinnamon in a paper sack and took the Churros straight from the frying pan and into the paper sack and shook them up. Then set them on a plate to cool. If your grease is not hot enough, they will fall apart. I checked my grease constantly and kept it closer to 350F. 
Yummy! I think I'll make a thinner version in the morning!
Update: I made the smaller version (.5-.75") and I doubled the batch and I had every problem that everyone else had. My bag split, my churros fell apart in the fryer.... So, next time I'll make the big fat ones again. (about 1.5" in diameter). Also I won't put a double batch in the bag. I think between the double batch and the smaller hole, there was too much heat and pressure for the bag to handle.

Super easy,  super delicious! I used a pastry bag with a 1/2" tip. The first batch were perfect, but as my oil cooled down, they got crunchier. I would recommend making a few, then letting your oil heat back up.

The one thing this recipe is missing is eggs which would make for a lighter and less dense chewy churro, try adding 3-4 eggs after removing flour from stovetop, mix 1 at a time until dough is glossy.
You will notice a difference.

Really delicious. Eat them all fresh!! We had some to-die-for chocolate sauce that we ate these with. We wanted to save some for a later date so we put them in the fridge and warmed them up later... Definitely not as good, haha. Fresher is better. Thanks for the easy recipe.

This recipe was great! Easy, quick. I used my Dessert Decorator Plus (basically a caulking gun for desserts). I had to get my boyfriend to push it thru tho because it's really thick. Tasty!!

The recipe worked great! The consistency of the dough was perfect. I just made one tiny change, I rolled the churros in brown sugar and cinnamon, amazing combination.

Delicious and very authentic... piping them is very difficult however because the dough is very thick and HOT! This recipe doesn't make a lot either, but if you are looking for a very authentic tasting chirro, THIS IS IT! Still deserves five stars!

This recipe saved the day!  Our recreation director ordered Churros for her function and my Jamaican staff had no idea of what to do.  I pulled this up and with no prior experience and very little time, I had hot, fresh churros for all of our residents.  If you are stuck without a pastry bag (like I was), you can roll the dough out into long thick ropes (the texture might be heavier, but I had 20 minutes to pull this all together)  Thank you

I didn't really like these churros, they were very oily even after  we drained them. I don't want anymore pimples, thank you very much. But that said, otherwise, they tasted okay.

I love churros but hate paying the large amount to get them at the restaurant. These are delicious! I had a huge issue with my bag ripping so I just formed them by hand into balls. just as good!

I followed people's advice about 1 tablespoon sugar and 1 tablespoon oil. The pastry bag will be extremely hot if you shift the dough straight from the pan to the bag so let it cool for a minute or two. I found my bag broke but i just squeezed out a roll of dough each time and floured my hands and rolled it out. it was exactly the same. I found i had to make the churro very thin as the dough wasn't cooking on the inside. I guess i couldn't get the temperature correctly. it was too doughy even on lower heat. when i finally got the right temperature it was still not as fully cooked as i think it should be and i ended up with only 1/3 of the servings correctly. the rest had to be thrown away

My Daughter loved the Churros. This ingredients are affordable and this recipe is so easy to make and cook. Good thing my sister-in-law gave my daughter a cake/biscuit decorator and it made it more easier for us to get the traditional Churros look. :)

Very yummy and very easy to make.
I used a candy thermometer to get the temp of the oil just right.
Use a cloth pastry bag or the plastic ones will be burst.
Double the recipe cuz they will be gone in no time!!!

I have hidden this recipe for quite some time because I was scared to make these.  OMG!!!  These were so easy to make and my kids and husband chewed them up!  I used all of Cat's modifications.  1 Tbsp. of oil and 1 Tbsp of sugar for the dough instead of the original measurements. Also, I did not have a pastry bag but a Pampered Chef cookie dough press.  It has a tip on it that made the churros look like real churros with the cool ridges.  I only made one batch and these suckers were gone in five minutes.

This are amazing! I made them for a quince we were hosting at our school and they were great! Nice and crispy, and great tasting! I am 15, so this recipe is pretty simple if I can do it. (: I read other reviews about how they were chewy, so here's my suggestion: make sure they are baked all the way through by using a smaller star-shaped end piece on your pastry bag, and they come out just perfect with the right consistency. I strongly recommend this to everyone! (:

Yum! Thank you for sharing.  These were a great end to our cinco de mayo meal tonight.  We served them with homemade cinnamon ice cream.  I added a little vanilla bean paste to the dough.  Next time I will try mexican vanilla!

My 13 yo daughter wanted to make Churros after visiting relatives in FL; this recipe was awesome! We did use the suggestion of reducing the sugar to 1 Tbs and the oil to 1 Tbs.  She was able to do the entire recipe except I didn't want her using the Fryer, so I helped with that.  The suggestion of using the Pampered Chef Easy Accent Decorator (thanks for the sugg; I would not have thought of using that), was good, I thought the dough was a little hard to move through the decorator, but it was definately a great idea as I do not have a pastry bag.  We would definately make this again!
Fun snow day activity for us here in the Northeast!

I had to make this for a classroom of 30 children. I'm not sure if they were just okay because of the quantity or what but they were alot more work than I was willing to put in. By the end I felt like I was swimming in dough. My saving grace is that kids love sugar.

Closest to the real thing.  I lived in Mexico for about 22 years and this is by far the one recipe with the most similarities to the churros from the corner "puestos". A serious treat!

Mine didn't turn out well. Cooked from the outside, raw from the inside. But it must of been something I had done wrong. The batter looked fine, I think the frying threw me off. I was never very good at frying. Got burned a few times :P.  I'm sure this recipe would of been tasty if I had done it correctly!

Time to make the CHURROS! Made this Churros recipe this morning at 6am using a 1 inch star tip and pastry bag. I found myself using varying times in order for the churros NOT to get too crunchy at the 375 degrees in a fryer. 25 sec each side too crunchy 15 sec each side to doughy in the middle. Finally around 18 to 20 seconds got it as perfect as I could.  I'm now thinking that next time I will use a larger tip to deliver a thicker churro to the oil.  Overall the taste of these Churros have been my favorite from several of the recipes I have tried from other online site. In conclusion I think in order to get the consistency I want from my Churros I will add a couple of eggs to give it that "beefy" middle along with a larger tip. I'll keep you posted. :-)

These churros were delicious!  I made them for Cinco de Mayo and everyone loved them.  I would double the recipe because they WILL get eaten.  I love how the ingredients are everything I have on hand every day.  Enjoy.

These were great & easy to make!! Only problem I had was that my pastry bag split while pipping, b/c the dough was so hot. I think next time i will use a cookie press

Great recipe and best churros I have ever made!  Since I don't have a pastry bag, used a cookie press and it worked perfectly and made the strips thin enough so it cooked very quickly and evenly.

I tried this recipe today for the first time and it turned out pretty good. I really liked how the balls were versus the strips. The dough in the plastic bag was really warm and made the slit at the bottom of the bag bigger( slit the opening for the churro dough to come in strips). My son had fun helping to shaping the dough balls, coating the churros with the cinnamon and sugar mixture, and of course eating them!

MUCHAS GRACIAS!!!!! To both the submitters and helpers on the Recipe Exchange. I originally decided to forego on this deep frying excursion for my spanish class and was able to whip them all out in less than an hour!!! Next time, I need to work on my heating skills and not burning the oil..or letting the dough fry for too long. I used a 1/2 TBLS to measure my dough and then rolled them into logs to make mini churros, a cross between ugly and cute. Back to my spanish class, I was unable to take them to school as they got soft and soggy over night [[duhh >.

This was sooo good! Tastes exactly like a churro you'd get at a carnival but the texture is different, thicker, but still good! I popped two zip loc bags, and one wilton pastry bag (but was still useable)  We just squirted the dough into coiled squiggles in the deepfryer then just broke pieces off. :) We ate the whole batch...will be making these again for sure!!

It was good but since I used a little oil to fry, one exploded on me o_o! So I opted to roll them out thin and cut slits in them and make twisty shapes.

I loved these! The kids loved them too! Very simple and quick to make when you are craving a yummy treat. I didn't have a pastry bag or tip so I used a heavy duty freezer bag with a tip cut off to squeeze my dough through. It worked great, although they weren't as light an airy as the type that are squeezed through a pastry tip. Very good with a cup of hot tea.

I took these to a family get together and didn't leave with a single one!!  Everyone loved them.  I didn't have pastry bags, so just had to roll out the dough and toss it into the pan - they didn't look like churros, but they tasted like them!!  My only problem with the recipe was my husband covered them before they'd cooled completely so we had to put them in the oven at the get together to get them back to their crispy state.  It worked wonderfully though!!

I used a cake decorater to pipe the churros out, which worked out well, but there were a few problems; first of all, churros are suppossed to be crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, but mine were so thin that I wasn't able to make them chewy inside. Still good, but not authentic. Thicker is better. Also, since the cake decorater was meant for frosting, it wasn't strong enough for the dough and the fabric burst, and then I wasn't able to make any more churros. If you're going to use a cake decorater, be careful.

This recipe was okay. I thought they lacked a bit of flavor and tended to burn on the outside and not cook on the inside. Thanks anyway for the recipe. By the way, I believe churros ARE mexican and crullers are from Spain.

Very good. I did not have a problem with burning. Those who did may have had their oil too hot. This makes a rather small batch--make sure to double it if you're making them for kids.

Good, but not the best I tried. Just wanted to say that "Churros" are from Spain, not Mexico!

The dough suprisingly held together well in the oil.  They were very tasty!  The only thing I would recommend is using a very small flower in the end of your cookie press.  The larger flower took longer to cook and by the time the inside was cooked, the outside was burned.  Though they tasted great, they didn't look good so I couldn't serve them at our Mexican-themed party.

well, for starters, unless you've got heavy duty pastry bags, don't use the bags. roll them by hand. they are prettier with the star shape, but you WILL go through more than one bag. even so, they are really tasteless, and burn very easily, which takes away the "easy" part of the recipe. my son just licked off the cinnamon sugar. the next day, they were greasy and limp. yuck. maybe churros are different elsewhere, but these sure didn't remind me of the kind we get here in south texas.

All my friends loved this recipe!! The taste was amazing and it was so simple to prepare and cook. The only problem was that I had to add a little more flour than the recipe stated...

I liked this recipe alot, however, compared to ones tried in the past (not made by me) I felt that something was missing.  Maybe it is the eggs that someone else pointed out before.  But overall i liked it and so did my family.

they are just as the real churros!  I used half the salt and half spoon more of sugar.  I used a cookie dough presser and they were just a little thinner than the real ones! one batch was gone between my husband, my daughter and myself.  You can somewhat do shapes with the dough and it's a winner with kids, I made letters and flowers for my kid and she was delighted.

I made these for our church missions' night and they were a hit! Everyone asked for the recipe, and there were no leftovers! The only thing I'll do differently next time is half the amount of salt - I thought it was a little strong. Keeping the burner heat at medium/high was a key - on high they burn, on medium they just sit and soak up the oil. You definitely have to keep an eye on them, but they're worth it! Thanks for a great recipe!!

This recipe is SO easy.  They tasted just like the churros I remember.  We are living in South Korea right now and don't have access to anything Mexican.  Mmm... had to play with cooking temp a bit, and i'm sure that the center would have cooked better had we had access to a star tipped pastry bag, but we use the resources we have!  This is definately a fun desert, and really, it's not as messy as people commented.

I loved them!! Issues: I tried using a pastry bag but the dough was too thick, so I rolled them in my hands too... and if you don't make them small enough they don't cook in the middle.
Good Things: Tasted great, easy to make, and they don't take much time
Good luck!

This recipe was surprisingly easy.  It took me 20 minutes from start to finish.  I didn't have a pastry bag so I just rolled the dough in my hands.  Now for the bad news:  No matter how long I cooked them, they were very doughy in the middle.  Also, I wasn't too impressed with the taste.  Perhaps something else needed to be added to the dough before cooking.

Yum! I love churros and this is the easiest recipe I have found for making these. They also taste great! It was hard to stop eating these! I had a little trouble with the pastry bag so I ended up rolling my dough (and burning my hands a bit) into little balls. They were still great, just needed to cook a little longer!

I was so excited to try this recipe but was disappointed. I've never tasted a traditional churro so I cannot compare ( I liked Costco when they sold it st their concession and I absolutely love the ones from Jack in the box) This was not as airy and the dough had no taste. I tried 3 different batches, changing the temperature each time. I had no thermometer but was able to judge by the doughiness in each. I did roll it by hand but don't think it was an issue. I cut the sugar and oil in the dough as suggested by some. I will try adding vanilla the next time and maybe follow the recipe exactly how it's written. Yes there will be a next time! ??

Made it with the suggested changes in the comments, reducing the sugar and oil to 1 tablespoon each and heat at 350F. I would add more cinnamon next time since I like it really cinnamon-y.

If you don’t have a large sized attachment for your piping bag, just don’t use any attachment, and simply pipe it raw from the bag.

I used pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon.  It was a nice spike instead of the usual. The recipe is very easy to follow. Also, you do not require a piping bag. I rolled my churros out because i dislike using a bag unless I absolutely have to.

I didn't have the huge tip/frosting bag, so I used a cookie press.  Worked great.  These were so easy to make and everyone love them.  Smaller size equals more cinnamon sugar to churro ratio  = really happy kids. My daughter and friends loved them as much as restaurant bought.

Didn’t like this at all. Despite mixing just until the mix came together, this made tough churros with very little lift.

I found the mix itself bland and unappetizing. Most things taste pretty good when deep fried and doused in sugar and cinnamon; this managed to remain unconvincing as a food item.

I ended up throwing the mix out, and making a recipe that used butter, an egg, and a little less sugar to the same amount of water and flour as in this recipe — amazing churros! 

The moral of the story — use your common sense and pick a recipe that has better ingredients!

FABULOUS!!  My 7th grade grandson could get 15 points if he would make an authentic Hispanic dish.  We chose churros as the class isn't until 6th period and there was no way to reheat or chill anything.  I read all the reviews and this is what I did:
electric skillet
heat set to 350 degrees
followed directions regarding ingredients, etc.
used a beef jerky gun (looks like caulking gun)
squeezed out dough onto parchment paper & then EASILY
   lifted them into hot oil
(I let my dough cool down and I think I could have easily used a decorator icing bag or Ziploc to squeeze it out--letting it cool did not hamper the end results)
EXTREMELY PLEASED and hope that my grandson and I receive our 15 points tomorrow!!!
Thank  you for sharing a wonderful & simple recipe!!!

I would like to add to this review.  I TRIPLED the recipe to have enough for his class.  NOTE: with the current amount of sugar and cinnamon, I ALMOST was able to roll the TRIPLE batch of churros, so needless to say, you can cut back on the amount of sugar and cinnamon.  

Yes, he did get his 15 points!!!!  However, I will note here that they need to be eaten the day they are made and not the day after....  :(

Made this last night for the time, they were devoured! Followed the recipe, agree with an earlier post on cutting back the cinnamon and sugar mixture as well as lowering the heat to 350. Mine weren't long, short and sweet for a 2 bite treat!

I could be a moron. Churros seem to be my achilles heel. I made these exactly as described using ziplock pastry bag. The bag split in several place so I tried a pastry bag. It still burst. The churros I managed to make were gooey and brown outside.  I’ll try again, but no time soon...

I didn't change the recipe, I only added more cinnamon. I couldn't find my piping bag, so I let the dough cool enough to touch, I took pieces and rolled them with my hands. That way I got the size I wanted and the thickness. I also turned down my oil once it was heated to cook them through.

These did NOT work.  Dough was WAY too hard to push through any tip on any party bag we tried.  When we fried them, the dough did not rise, the middle did not cook.

I made these according to the recipe.  They were so much easier than I expected.  I did have to make sure I kept the oil heated to a low-med temperature so as not to cook them too quickly, and I used a medium star tip for piping out the dough.  They turned out a nice golden brown, and tasted like a fried donut!  Very good recipe.

This recipe helped me make the most amazing homemade Churros...they came out perfect!!!! The trick is not to have your oil too hot, or they will brown very quickly and not cook the inside

Adjusting the temperate on an electric stove creates extra work to make the dough work perfectly.

It seems like a little denser of a dough, which makes it hard if you thicken the churro sticks, to know when exactly to pull them out of the oil without being left with a perfectly crunchy outside and a raw inside. 

It would be an easy and fun baking experiment for younger children, mixing and sprinkling. :)

I made a GL Free version for my nephews they turned out great. A little tip that I have formulated is when making GLF use Bob's Redmill GLF 1:1 it's in the blue bag. Also, you will need to cook longer at a lower temp. that is with all GLF recipes.

I was hesitant about making these because I have never done them before but they were super simple. The hardest part about it was getting the batter piped into the oil and that’s probably because I only had a star tip that was kind of closed. I would recommend taking them out of the oil a little before you think they need to be because they will brown a little when taken out of the oil. I doubled the batch except the cinnamon sugar coating and it was the perfect amount of batter to topping. If you only make one batch, half the topping recipe. We made our own chocolate sauce with semi sweet chocolate chips, cream and a bit of vanilla melted in a double boiler. The sauce wasn’t a certain recipe, just flying by the seat of our pants. Anyway, overall the churros were easy and tasty. I am definitely going to make them again.

These are PERFECT!! sooo yummy. I didnt change a thing from the original recipe, they are delicious. Definitely take them out as soon as they golden up, not brown (for the perfect crunchy outside gooey inside churro texture).

It was okay. I will keep looking for a better receipt though. 
The dough was to thick for my taste.

I tried other recipe before but it doesnt work. This one is absolutely easy to follow. Just make sure the temperature to fry is hot enough so that your churros wont break. I made that mistake in first batch.

I made these with the exact ingredients listed. They turned out great! Not chewy at all. Dough is too thick to pipe into grease. I used a cookie press with a star disc and piped the entire batter on to parchment paper ahead of time. (Once dough gets cold it will be hard to pipe.) I don’t have a deep fryer, so I fried these on the stove with a 2 qt sauce pan, temp was just a little over medium heat. I fried 5 at a time and for 2 mins per batch. They fried golden brown and not chewy on the inside. Yielded 15 sticks. Average size of each were 5 inches long and pinky finger thick. Made vanilla pudding to dip these in.

This was so easy and SO good! I used a cookie press because the dough is really hot and I don’t have a bag with a star tip ?? ... and the first couple looked like turds rolled in cinnamon and sugar when I tried to use a baggie with the corner cut off. LOL

I made churros! Crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside in a good way. Used a Wilton star tip and cloth pastry bag to pipe. Great!

I find it difficult to put the recently boiled dough into a plastic bag to pipe into rows. As always, for me, frying dough has varied results, the middle efforts are often my best. I took a few suggestions and cut down on sugar and oil, to prevent extra browning and sogginess... didn't seem to help? There seems to be some kinks I or the recipe needs to work out.

I loved this. My husband saw Churros on Masterchef this weekend so I decided to give them a shot. I was not able to use the piping tip that I had purchased as my bag ripped from the pressure. Since this is the first time I've ever had a churro I do not know if my batter was too thick (Don't think so as they cooked perfectly) or just that I bought cheap bags. So I just had long solid ones no fancy sides but they were crispy outside and soft inside. Very happy with this recipe.

YUM!
i mixed in the flour slowly and ended up not using the full cup, with 3T sugar- before dough really thickened.
i didnt use a pastry bag, but rolled out into tubes - make 'em thin to cook evenly as the dough is thick.
i used my air fryer and done in abut 20 min, loved em.

First time making chrurrod and even though I fried them too long we still liked them. I need them for a cupcake order so I had to practice. The 2nd time I used canola oil(only oil I had) and fried them to perfection. They were nice and spongy on the inside and crunchy on the outside. Everyone loved them. I just wish they stayed fresher longer to make ahead for parties  but really once they pop out of the fryer everyone practically inhaled them.

I followed the suggestion of only using 1Tbl. of oil and 1 Tbl. Of the sugar in the dough and they were great! It is also important to keep your oil as close to 375 as possible so you get a nice golden brown exterior. These are a keeper!

Great tasting dough and very easy to make. The only change I made was I rolled the dough into long strips to make the churros a little thicker and they didn't fall apart. The piping bags made them more like churro chips from taco bell and they fell apart easily.

Yum! These were very good- I had the oil a bit too hot and so they came out slightly raw in the center, but if the oil had been at the right temperature they would have been perfect! Considering it was the first time making them, I think they came out very good and I will definitely be making these again... just with correct temp.

Followed the helpful comment of reducing sugar and oil in the dough. These came out really great! I piped with Wilton 4B tip. If you have a cloth piping bag, definitely use that. I bursted two plastic ones during piping. Also, paper bag for coating the sugar works wonder. Sometimes it might not look like it's got enough sugar but trust me they're still sweet enough.

Made these today, National Churro Day. I fried them at a lower oil temperature and removed then when they turned a very light brown and firm to the touch. The only concern I have is that they are too, too sweet. So what I did was decreased the amount of sugar and cinnamon. Followed the recipe  as written. This was a very easy recipe. These churros are rich. crispy, sweet with a little heat. Will make these again in the future.

I tried making this and it did not turn out as how I hoped it would be. I followed the recipe exactly and did the correct measurements. Before I put the dough in my piping bag, it seemed dryer than it was in the video. I added some more water and it was better. I think I will try another recipe than this one.

Used the modified "Original Spain recipe" 1 tblsp sugar and 1tbsp oil in the dough but I do not have a churrera so it was too hard to pipe so I rolled them out and cut, then twisted them like screws.  Kids ate them all immediately so 5 stars:

a) only 1 tbl of sugar in the dough (cuts the browning); b) only 1 tbl of oil in the dough (cuts the chewiness). It should be noted that you only need to mix dry with wet for 30 sec. I also used a churreria...

My churros turned out raw on the inside. I heated my oil to the suggested temperature, so maybe it was my stove's fault. I will probably try the again on a lower heat but I'm not sure yet.

Very tasty and simple to make, I made per the recipe. The only issue that I had with this was that the dough had to be handrolled and did not work in a piping bag. This was easy to pre-measure everything and mix up while we were camping with our little fryer on the picnic table. will make again.

This was very easy to make but my dough was too thick. It made it difficult to squeeze out the piping tube. I served mine plain with chocolate sauce (the Spanish way) instead of doing the cinnamon sugar. My BF loved them!

Very chewy, takes way too long to cook, doesn’t brown well enough. Unable to even squeeze it out from a piping bag. Had to just use my hands and make long logs for the shape.

These were amazing, better than the ones we had in Spain! I just reduced the sugar and oil to one tablespoon each. This one is a keeper for sure!

I made the dough to thick so the inside didn't cook, of course that's not the recipe's fault but other than that i thought that the churros where great!

Just made this, probably the 2nd time I've ever made churros. I've never eaten 'authentic' churros so I can't compare, but even without a pastry bag and star tip these turned out great. Super crispy and satisfies the sweet tooth. Be sure to fry these until they are dark brown and crispy. Added vanilla to the dough as well.

They turned out great! My first time making churros... they are crispy, not chewy at all! 

I think i put in a tiny bit more of water and tiny bit less of sugar and oil. Just a few drops less tho. 

Fried on 3/4 heat, electric stove, until light brown. 

Very easy to make and also fast! (Done in about 20 minutes) perfect. Thank sou for this great recipe!

I was a bit disappointed with this recipe. The dough turned out more chewy . I had to shape them into french fries for a more crunch.

My family said that these churros are better than Disneyland churros! They melt in your mouth. I did as others suggested and cut the sugar and oil in half for the batter. Doubled the recipe and served them with ice cream. Just amazing!

This was AMAZING! Although, the pastry bag split, so instead we just made chunks of churro. I doubled the recipe (all except the cinnamon sugar) for 6 people and it worked really well! I am totally doing this again!

I read the reviews, so I will address some common themes.  I used a plastic pastry bag and it worked very well with a wide pastry tip. Only change I made was using coconut oil at 375 in an electric skillet to fry them in and that worked out great.  Fried nicely, no burning at that temp and they were done all the way through. Skillet made it easy to pipe them right into the oil.  I found tongs worked best to turn them.  When done, I turned them out on a cookie rack with paper towels underneath. Rolled in cinn/sugar while warm.  My whole family loved these, even my toddler.  Since July 4th came on a Tuesday, we had our traditional cookout yesterday.  So it was taco Tuesday and we had these for dessert.  I'm sure I will be making these again. Thanks for sharing!

Made these today for the first time- very good flavor and light!. One hint: I tried to pipe the "dough" out of a piping bag, (which ended up bursting) so i just rolled "long strings" of dough. The strings that were width of my pinky and fried to golden brown were perfect. The ones that i had made larger (index finger size) didn't get done in the very center. Next time i can make them perfect! Also i had t make the oil not so hot, i burn the first ones i fried to a crisp.

I decided to make this recipe for me and my brother. Yes it was very simple to make. How ever I made a few changes to it. I added 1 teaspoon of brown sugar to the ingredients that were boiling. I then added 1/4 cup of powdered to the flour mixture. Once I had it all mixed together I added 4 drops of vanilla extract for a more sweeter outcome. I did like how simple the recipe was. The one flaw I would point out that I also read on other reviews was that it was very tough. Overall very easy recipe and I would definitely make it again just figure out a way for It not to be so tough.

okay, listen. I was super excited to make these churros. They seemed really simple to make and my cousin and I were very excited. We whipped up the recipe, no problems there. When it came to frying them, we ran into major trouble. The first round of churros were burnt on the outside, but raw on the inside. We changed our oil and restarted. We thought maybe the thickness was the problem so we made thinner churros by rolling them out after we 'piped' them. Still raw on the inside. Now we don't have any churros, have a big mess to clean up, and are sad. Do NOT plan on making these ever again.

Heeding the advice to reduce sugar and oil to 1 tablespoon each, these were great! Sifted the flour and made sure to not over mix the dough (Stirred with a wooden spoon until it just came together). Used a piping bag with the piping fixture but no tip (since it was too compact a mix to push through with the tips I have) while still a bit warm. Perfect size. Had no issues with the mix becoming too hard. Piped on to a board lined with foil and then transferred to frying pan. Low temp ensured it cooked through. Let them take their time until they got to a pale golden color, let the excess oil drain  away with a slotted spoon and rolled immediately in sugar before plating. Some stuck to one another in the pan but I would just separate them with the spoon as I flipped them over. Letting a few seconds go by before adding another churro to the pan also helped to avoid some sticking. Glad to have come across this recipe!!

The batter turned out doughy regardless of how long I cooked it.  It seems like it would need some baking soda or baking powder to solve that.  I tried to cook it longer to get rid of doughy texture.  The problem it is would burn the outside.  So I tried to cook it at a low setting for most of the extended cooking time and then turn it up a little to make it golden on the outside.  Even after 14 minutes of cooking it was still doughy.  Is this recipe supposed to be doughy?  Other than that it was very tasty.

the batter was very easy to make however I fried them till golden brown at the correct temperature but the inside did not cook well. It was almost as if it was raw inside. I ate some anyway and the cinnamon and sugar made up for it. I will try it once more and try frying at a little lower temperatyre

these were interesting. I've never ate a churro so I didn't know what to expect. I thought they would be more light and airy. my first 6 were very crunchy. but the top was splitting before I turned. so I decided to jiggle and roll them as they were cooking. this stopped the splitting and kept them straight, but I also cooked them less. result was crisp on the outside but doughy in the middle. I think the key is to lower temperature, jiggle and cook a little more. 

for newbies like me, all of them were very limp when removing from oil, but stiffened after a minute. the dough is unlike any I've made, very stiff, almost gelatin like. you can pipe but be sure to use real pastry bag, plastic melts and splits. use an extra large star tip. don't put all dough in bag and that makes it easier to pipe since it's very warm. lastly,  you can pipe directly into pan, just use a knife to cut dough off tip. 

the family wasn't wowed, but they did eat them all. this is such a fast, simple recipe I will try it again.

These were so easy and delicious I just had to make more after the first. I made them traditional chirps with caramel in the center. Poked a whole through and yummy goodness all in the center. Fry them just right and you get that delicious sugary crunch in the final product. Will be making these forever!!

I was a little intimidated but I followed other reviewers suggestions  and reduced sugar and oil. Batter/dough was very dense so I might add a little more water next time. I might add some cinnamon or vanilla next time too.  I used a pastry bag, 1M tip and piped onto waxed paper. I used a deep fryer and they fried up very nicely. Getting the temp just right is important but too hot is definitely a nono.

This recipe for this was great, but there were s few things I would do differently. I used a rubber piping bag so the batter wouldn't melt a whole, which is what happened when I used a plastic bag. I also piped them out on a baking sheet to get the right length and so I could fry them whenever I wanted. In the recipe it said to fry until golden, but I did it until they more brown and it worked out fine. (Just as a side note in case you want to know, I'm doing a science experiment on this which led me to make this recipe seven times.)

The first time I made them they turned out perfect but every subsequent time, they dont seem to come together! I end up having to put twice or three times as much flour to get the batter to stick, and then when I pipe them on wax paper for the freezer the bottom flattens (I tried this the first time and it worked perfectly!) Any suggestions?

Delicious!! Going to a Mexican dinner tonight and thought these would be fun to bring and they are soooo good!! I made a double batch but only used 3T oil in the batter, as other posters suggested. No need to double the coating though. Batter was really hard to put though the pastry bag and it burst out the side at first. Retried with double bag and worked fine, but still a workout, lol. Definitely save this recipe

Cheap, easy, and yummy! We don't have a pastry pipe or whatever so I just rolled it out and cut strips to fry. Make them a lot.

I made them exactly like recipe said and they were perfect, tasted like the ones i just had in Mexico,  nice crunch on outside and creamy in the middle,  was so easy i highly recomend, i deep fried them for  5 minutes at 380° and 4 at a time, granted i dont have the bag abd attachment for churro reg look but tasted exactly like it should, easy breezy, remember slower is faster and cook with love.

The churros came out very good. The only thing I have to say is that the inside was a little mushy and next time I make them I will leave them in the oil a little longer.

These were too doughy and browned too fast. My husband Loved them doughy and all. He said they are a softer version of churro so he's had and I agree. The flavor is there just need some tweaks.

These are amazing! My son's favorite treat at Disney has always been churros. They changed their recipe and due to his food allergies he can no longer have them. I tried this recipe, very easy to follow. He said that they are even better than Disney's!

This recipe is awesome! I made these for my family and they went crazy for them. I did everything like the recipe said and they turned out great! Make sure your oil is at 375 degrees for sure though or they may not cook properly. I made the churros smaller though because I didn't have a big enough nozzle, but I honestly prefer the way that I made them than any of the restaurant ones. Very happy!

They were very good and easy to make but I didn't have the pastry tube.  I think I need to purchase one for next time.  I think the sugar and cinnamon would stick better.

They were very tasty.

I've made these a bunch of times now. They're ridiculously quick and easy. I pipe them using my biscuit gun and a star fitting. First few times I mixed, pipes and fried immediately. Tonight I mixed and piped them early to take to friends for dinner and we fried them after we'd eaten. They were still great. Now we're all lolling around in churro comas.

I made the recipe exactly as written.  The recipe seemed ok, but the technique was problematic.  I tried a freezer quality quart bag for piping, and it burst immediately.  Then I tried a plastic Wilton piping bag, and it wanted to break quickly too.  It must have been the consistency of the dough.  So I learned to put my hand around the weak area to prevent too much pressure build-up.  I tried Wilton tip 35 (which is large for frosting), and they were so tiny.  I tried my biggest tip, which was a huge 4B, but there is no coupler to fit with that attachment, so I had to try to hold it to the bag with my hand, while covering the weak spot.  Eventually, the bag did burst, and I rolled them by hand.  They no longer looked like churros, just dough sticks.  Either way, the churros are way smaller than those I've bought before.  If there is a better technique to get larger churros, I'd come back to this recipe and change my rating.  Until then, it's a lot of hassle, but the taste is pretty good.

Turned out great! Used my special piping tip to get the nice ridges so they cooked right through each time. I put the cinnamon sugar in a container and let the kids shake them till they were coated and ready to eat. Whole family loved them.

Love love love them! Tho it is not necessary to waste 1 cup of sugar at all. All you need is like 4 spoons.  Make sure they brown so that the flour cooks throughly, otherwise it will be chewy and give you indigestion. Lol other than that great job! :)

While these were delicious, they didn't quite work the way they were supposed to. The dough was so thick that I had to add more water to it.  It was like cement.  They also deflated and broke apart into strings, but I think my star tip was just not the right size. Still, I'd give it another try.

My guests loved them! And they took about 10 minutes to make. 
My paste had a lovely consistency. I didn't change anything but I did use caster sugar and sieved my flower. Don't be afraid to let your sugar water boil for a minute or two. 
I had no problems with texture and will definitely make this again.

This recipe was okay, the pastry dough was fine, but the temperature for frying was WAY TOO HIGH. I'd recommend around 325* if you aren't keen on having burnt outsides and raw insides. The raw dough is okay to consume since there aren't any eggs; which is also nice because I'm a vegan. I would also recommend not mixing the dough too much as it will get harder to chew once it's fried. I had little success with making full length churros, so I settled for little churro bites, which were basically little balls of the dough. They turned out really nice and I would recommend them as little treats in your kid's lunchboxes.

I cut the batter sugar and oil in half like another reviewer suggested and these were great.  Be careful not to have your oil too hot or they will be doughy in the middle.

First batch turned out not so good but my tip was too big.  The second batch I made, I added vanilla to the mixture after it came to a boil and I turned the heat off.  I also used a star tip the second time around.  They were ribbed and thinner this time and turned out much better. It's a lot of work to squeeze the dough out of a smaller tip but worth it when you taste them.

I followed the recipe exactly and the dough was perfect. My mistake was using a pastry tip that was too big. This in turn made the churro so too big and needed more time to cook, so this made them quite brown on the outside. I have since purchased a smaller tip and am looking forward to making these again. They were very good and reminded me of Barcelona.

Instead of using the traditional churro shapes I went ahead and used a regular 1cm piping tip for the batter. Went a lot better than first thought! They cooked alot faster and weren't chewy. Just perfect!

Tried the pastry bag method but a little fussy. Easier to just roll lengths of dough by hand.  Able to fry them in a pot a few at a time.  End result is till yummy!

I made the mistake of putting way too much salt. And then I added more water which was a no and lastly I left it to fry to long so it was way to crunchy. However, I think it would have turned out way better if I had followed the exact recipe. Will try again in the morning .

I had never had churros before so I had no point of reference for how they should taste but I thought these were great. Made the recipe exactly as stated. Had all of them fried up and on the table in less than 10 minutes. Used Wilton tip 1M. They cooked up about the thickness of my index finger, crisp on the outside and slightly soft in the center. Yum!

I liked it a lot but I would fry them on a temp of 325-350 instead of 375 because they would brown to quickly and not cook all the way inside so they'd be chewy. That's what I did and it turned out way better. Also I would recommend putting butter on them then sprinkle cinnamon and sugar on. Tastes awesome.

I just don't know how to make them without them ending up having raw dough inside still...I cut them thick medium and thin and no matter what I do they still come out with dough in them...

I have no experience deep-frying anything, and don´t have a thermometer. But this was actually a lot easier than I thought. Used the bubbles-on-a-wooden-spoon method to get the oil temperature right and the make-snakes-like-play-doh method to roll the churros (forget the piping anything through a bag, I can´t see that working at all). I don´t know a lot about churros, so I made them about the size and shape of a hot dog weiner and fried them one or two at a time. Golden and crisp on the outside, soft and a little chewy inside. Don´t know what they´re supposed to taste like, but these were popular here!

I made these last night for our Southwestern Night  dinner at church. I quadrupled the recipe.  I did add vanilla. But that was the only modification. 
They were a HUGE IT! Even had requests to sell orders next week.. I was very pleased with these and will definitely make again. Maybe this weekend!

This was super easy and yummy. I tried another recipe earlier that involved eggs, and it wasn't TOO hard, but this was WAY easier and in my view tastier. They didn't split or anything and cooked through perfectly. I just used a pot with oil in it and guessed on the temperature after dropping in a piece of bread...after about 3 minutes it looked nice, so I figured I was at a good temp. I think the cinnamon sugar mix could last you 3 or 4 times, so you could either reduce it down by at least half or save the leftovers. DEFINITELY my go to recipe now.

These were a little chewy for my taste.  I also couldn't put the batter through my cookie press too thick!  I would just sprinkle the cinnamon and sugar on rather than roll it.  My cinnamon and sugar was a big oily mess by the end.

Made as stated. It was my first try making churros. Turned out really nice, bit chewier than planned. I did see some recipes contain egg so i am determined to try to see if that turns out fluffier as the ones i tasted did. But as is these are lovely. They cook better if you use a medium size nozzle to pipe. Large nozzles give you fatter ones but sometimes dont cook through if your oil is too hot. Served with white chocolate sauce. Was divine!

I have never commented on any recipe yet.  But these were amazing ! My boyfriend and I LOVED them ! I followed the recipe exactly. They came out crispy on the outside and perfect on the inside. I just cut a can of pop, cut a square out of it, made a cone and taped It up .cut whatever shape into it that I wanted and pushed it through a corner of a zip lock bag and taped it together for my piping bag. It turned out excellent! ! I would recommend piping out each one ahead of time if you're doing it alone. So you can quickly coat the cinnamon sugar on while it's still hot. I used the dough once it was cooled and didn't have a problem it came out so nicely ! Would definitely recommend this recipe and I know for a fact I'll be making it again and again !

The flavor of the dough was good (slightly sweet) but they were very doughy on the inside. Not fluffy and airy at all. They were just too dense, everyone aggreed.

These were an absolute hit! The only thing I changed is that I put about 1 1/2 tablespoons of sugar and cut down on the oil to about 1 tablespoon. Since the dough was hot, the ziplock bag that I used to pipe in the churros, ripped so have spares in case. And also once you are done with the churros, by the time you season them with the sugar and cinnamon (which the recipe calls for 1/2 cup but i cut both ingredients down in half because it was too much) they become cold, so just pop them into the microwave for about 15-20 seconds for a warmer churro :)

Pretty good! Very good recipe! Don't make churros too thick, because if too thick, they will not cook all the way through.

I have not tried making them yet, but while my mom and sister is away for a whole week, I'll probably make some for the rest of the family. I love churros!!! At Sams Club, [a general department/grocery store] they would sell hotdogs, giant preztels, ice cream, and churros! You wouldn't believe how hard I begged my mom for one churro. I can't wait to try them!!!

I tried this recipe for a snack in my Spanish class. I was very happy about the results. However, instead of piping them into a deep fryer (like the recipe stated) I rolled them out and then dunked them in. Either way, it worked! My whole class loved it and so did I. Also, I would recommend keeping them in the deep fryer for 2 minutes so that it will cook on the inside as well as the outside.

Perfect and easy! The recipe is very clearly written and works like a charm.  I didn't want to get out the piping bag so I just made thin little pancake shapes and they fried up wonderfully.  If you do this, make sure they are thin or the middles don't cook through (they were tasty anyway and there's nothing in them that makes the raw dough dangerous). People who had trouble with them browning too quickly: your oil is too hot.  It's not the recipe's fault.

Simple to make even though it was my first time. I did have to add a little more water to my dough because it was too dry. Other than that, they were really good. Will make again

These are amazing!! I'm from Mexico and these taste just like the ones back home!! I make these every now and then but I never have leftovers!! So glad I could find a homemade recipe instead of buying churro mix. Great recipe!

My family (and I) absolutely LOVED these! My brother made them first but they did not come out to good.I tried my hand at them and (I don't mean to brag) they came out much better. I made a double batch the other day, and learned that I need to triple the recipe. I  do not like to us pastry bags so instead I roll them.

First of all, the fact that these didn't turn out right is probably my fault. When I was done cooking the batter, it was much too thick to pipe, so I added water. I didn't have a thermometer so I had to guesstimate the temperature. When our first ones turned out much too doughy, I had to roll them into little sticks the size of a pencil in order for them to cook through, as well as reducing the temperature of my oil by more than half. In addition to that, I consider this the best way to waste a ton of oil. I don't think I will make them again, however my guests and family liked them just fine.

I tried this recipe and it was great for a quick snack in a pinch!!! I did find it a lil chewy! The next time I tried it after adding the flour and forming a ball I dropped 1egg in and teaspoon of vanilla and stirred until smooth (it's possible) and continue on with the recipe!!!! It made a world of difference! So crispy on the outside and soft on the inside! Best I've ever had!!!

Tried this recipe for the first time today and it turned out great! I couldnt measure the temperature of the oil but i left it at medium low heat. The first batch was abit hard/crunchy on the outside because i left it too long in the oil. But the second batch was soft and just great!

I tried the recipe but the dough was too hard so I added 2 eggs at the end after the dough cooled a little and used a pastry pipe... They came out super light and fluffy... Browned to perfection.. I used an electric deep fryer.. The recipe is a total keeper with my little twist..

I had to make up a restaurant for my culinary class and used this recipe for desert and as my presentation. I doubled it and it made roughly about 20 churros. These churros are then best thing in the world. They are amazing when you have vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup drizzled on the bottom and then adds a couple churros on the top. It will make ur taste buds dance

It came out really well. The only thing I did different was add an egg or two to the batter. They came out delicious and light.

This recipe was great. Tasted good. But half way through frying I found out that I didn't have any cinnamon :P but powdered sugar with a little but of cocoa powder works just as well with this recipe :)

This is a great recipe. I read everyones tweaks and put in less oil and sugar.  I put 1tablespoon instead of the 2 1/2 . I then made it as the original recipe calls for and found I liked it better. The first batch was a bit bland after putting the sugar and oil as the original called for it was perfect.

I followed the recipe without any changes and it turned out great! I made mini churros because I didn't have a large enougj tip for my pastry bag. They didn't come out chewy at all! You really just have to wait until they are golden brown.

Worked great-- make sure you pipe the dough very thin or your insides won't cook all the way. Also, I used my Fry Daddy for a perfect oil temp and it sped the process up a bit. :)

Don't get me wrong, this recipe is delicious and my family loves them. But everytime I go to make these, the first batch ALWAYS deteriates! It's like it needs the first born as a sacrifice to be able to work.
I follow the recipe to the letter, what am I doing wrong?

This recipe was amazing! With a few alterations, that is. As is, it was very easy to make but tasted like a churro. However, in my opinion, half the fun of churros is the texture, and the texture was terrible. It wasn't uncooked, but it wasn't light and fluffy either. IF YOU ARE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM DO NOT FEAR: Add a bit of baking soda! That is literally all it needs.

This recipe isn't the best at all, I was also surprised that I didn't need eggs for it, they came out very flat, NOT as fluffy as the one at fairs and stuff. I found another recipe with eggs and they came out perfect!

Very good and easy to do with grandchildern, however piping the hot dough mixture was a little testy at first. But figured out a little at a time is the key.:-)

Oh, big hit.  So quick and easy, and very, very tasty.  Would definitely make these again.

Wow, I just made an account on a foreign-language-site I rarely visit, just to post my opinion on those dumb 1 and 2-star-ratings.

But first of all:
Great recipe.
Did them ad though I failed choux pastry in the past(I guess I didnt knead enough), those were great. 

Even though my oil was WAY to hot(no thermometer =/ - they got dark brown(yummy- really!) within a minute), they came out great because my mothers dough-syringe has a rather small tip.
Though I have to say they got soggy too fast- advice would be appreciated. Or does this happen naturally? I figured mine might have been a little undercooked or something. Once I was done with the batch and chocolate, the latest made were soggy and I hate that feeling in the mouth.

This was soooo easy and DELICIOUS!!!
I followed directions to the T....I had no issues. I used coconut oil for the flour mixture and grapeseed for the frying.  I didn't have a pastry bad, but my ziploc worked great.
The texture was perfect and the right amount of chewyness in the middle.  I don't know why others have made revisions here and there to this recipe, there is no need to.

I was not very successful at making this recipe. The recipe did not specify about the thickness you should make the churro so I ended up making mine too thick. The outside got extremely burnt before the inside was cooked. So i suggest making them on the thinner side so the inside cooks.

The taste was awesome. The only that i didnt like was that most of them are still raw on the inside. I think my oil was to high. Next time I make these, I will cook them on a lower heat. I used a ziplock bag but the dough was really hot so I put on a oven mit and used that hand to squeeze! lol They came out really good. Thanks for the recipe!

5 stars all the way! What i love about this recipe is that it is easy, fun and plentiful! Ive made this 3 times already and each time, i always have plenty left over! Last night, a gal pal and i went to make 8 churros for ourselves, and we ended up with 27 long churros!! they were at least 6 inches long each! This is delicious and really fun to make! YOU MUST MAKE THIS!!! :D

The dough was super tough to squeeze through the pastry bag. Maybe I didn't do something right? Anyways, they turned out perfectly! I piped the dough into strips on a plate first, then put the strips into the hot oil 3 at a time. Thanks for the recipe!

These were delicious. It took be about 30 minuets to finish them and I made at least 40 of them. I defiantly recommend this. It just tastes like fried dough with sugar and cinnamon! It's a little piece of heaven.

These turned out great!  Just like the ones you order from the school fundraisers or get at the restaurants.  I used a large piping tip #864 in a ziploc bag and they turned out about 1" wide and 4" long.  My bag broke a few times.  I will need to find a sturdier pastry bag before I make them again.

I made these for a kids birthday party and both the kids and the adults devoured them.  They were so easy to make and tasted very authentic. They were a huge hit. 
*Note: the dough is too think for a pastry bag, like another reviewer, my pastry bag broke from trying to sqeeze the dough through. I just ended up rolling them out by hand (a little smaller than the size of a cigar) and they came out just fine. I'll be making these again.

This reciped took a while to cook, as you do not want to lower the oil temp by adding too many at a time. Also, make sure to eat them all the same day as mine were soggy the next morning even though they were in an air tight container. All in all they were a hit.

Imagine!! So simple to make and so tasty. A big hit with the kids and my husband has devoured the last batch I made! Not too messy and kids were able to help. Only tip.... treble the quantity as they are so good they won't last!

I just made these for my daughter and self for the holiday. i remember making them in a cooking class back in high school and those were terrible. this recipe was GREAT and you don't even need a pastry bag, i made them into little rings. i live in Germany and it was such a comfort to get something so good that tasted like back home. Thanks for posting this recipe! i also took the suggestion about not adding so much sugar to the dough and the amount of oil, they turned out just right. YUMMY!!!

These were simple and wonderful! I doubled the recipe for my family because one review said they were so good and there wasn't enough for seconds. Well... I made sure that wasn't going to happen and I am sure glad I did. The hubby and boys loved them so much they were eating them as I made them but mama hid a stash just for me to enjoy and i am glad I did! These are wonderful and simple!

I eat boatloads of churros from all over, and these ones just are far from the real deal.  They came out tasting a little too much like flour, hard on the outside, and lifeless in general.  Recommend finding another recipe.  In fact, I am experimenting now...

Very good- but not easy.  The dough was simple to make.  I let it cool before placing it into my Wilton's pastry bag.  The bad didn't break like other reviewers mentioned...maybe because Wilton makes very high quality bags.  The difficult part was making the perfect size and frying them for the right amount of time.  I used an entire batch of dough just trying to get the size right.  My churros came out too thin with a star decorating tip (almost like french fries) so I snipped the pastry bag opening to get the star tip out but then the churros were too thick and didn't cook all the way through.  I used a new pastry bag for my second batch of dough and snipped the opening a little smaller and then the churros turned out perfectly!  They tasted great.

I am going to a Cinco de Mayo themed party in about an hour and, about an hour ago had no idea what I was going to bring.  I just finished making up a double batch of these.  It's the first time I've made churros and they were easy and quick and taste delicious!  I used my Wilton cake decorator (with the push button) and star tip to make churros about 4 inches long.  As time went by and the batter cooled, it did get more difficult to push them out of the decorator, but not so hard that I wouldn't recommend this recipe to everyone!

I used a minature pastry tip and made small (about 3 inch long) churros. They were the HIT of the party. I was making churros for the first hour or so of the party but I think it was worth it. GREAT recipe!

I didn't have a deep fryer so I just heated up oil in a skillet.  A little more touchy to deal with, but still came out really yummy.  Also I piped most of my dough out of a ziploc until it broke.  Then I realized I could just form my own rolls with my hands it came out just as good.

At first I had the oil to hot and I burnt the outside. They turned out tasty, but I will probably not make again.

These were good - but the batter was a little bit too thick for me. I like to taste more of the cinnamon, crispy outside - but the soft, plain inside kind of overpowered the cinnamon taste.
