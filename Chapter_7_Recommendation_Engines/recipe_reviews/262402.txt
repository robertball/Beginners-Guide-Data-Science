No changes. However, I followed the tip to use a knife to test and it was never getting clean. I kept cooking it too long. I finally ignored the clean knife direction and took it out. I always used a toothpick in the past. It was tasty but dry. My own fault for not using my own way of testing. I will make it again.

This recipe is delicious just the way it is, but I added a light cream cheese frosting on top.

This is my new 'go to' bread, easy and tasty and healthier than my 'before' banana bread.  I did add raisins instead of chocolate.
