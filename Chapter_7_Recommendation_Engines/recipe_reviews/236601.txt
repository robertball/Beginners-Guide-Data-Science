The seasoning packets in corned beef is basically just pepper corns, mustard seeds and bits of bay leaves, maybe a little dried onion & garlic, but you can use "Pickling Spice" as well. 
I have been cooking Corned Beef for about 40 years now and one of the tricks I have found over the years for cooking it is to start out by putting your beef in COLD water and slowly heating it up to a simmer only in the spices. Never BOIL the meat, just simmer it or else the meat will be tough.

The perfect corned beef & cabbage recipe. What I do after I've following Chef John's recipe to the letter and have let it rest for 10-15 minutes is mix up some brown sugar with dejon mustard and coat the top of the brisket and stick it under the broiler for about 3-5 minutes until the sugar & mustard have "carmelized". Just that little bit of sweetness adds that extra "surprise" with each bite. My family & friends love it...thanks to Chef John!

As corned beef recipes go this is one of the best and easiest I have ever made. I used a 5.5 qt. dutch oven and a 2.5 lb. corned beef. Even with a small head of cabbage it was a tight fit for all the ingredients. So the next time the only thing that I would do different. Is to start earlier giving  myself  plenty of time. Now cooking wise let the corned beef, potatoes, onions, carrots, cook to fork tender and done. Once fork tender done remove the corned beef,potatoes, onions and carrots aside. Now add the cabbage into the liquid cook cabbage till done. Also by doing this you can now adjust the cabbage to your taste if you like it spicy or sweet or just let it cook in the liquid till done. Overall a winner and a keeper recipe. Thanks Chef John for another great recipe!!!!

I just made this corned beef, scaled down to a 2.5lb piece of meat. It's absolutely the best corned beef I've ever had. I live in NYC and am no stranger to Carnegie Deli, Katz's Deli, and 2nd Ave deli, but I would take this corned beef over them any day.

Used this recipe for a 3.75 lb brisket...came out perfect! I have only made corned beef one other time, and it was made in the crock-pot. From now on I am using this recipe, on the stove top, and making it more often! The video helped me a great deal as well! Thank you, Chef John!

Chef John's Corned Beef & Cabbage Haiku: "Sad St. Patrick's Day. Followed this whole recipe, didn't work for us." The only thing that ended up being edible in this meal was the cabbage and the carrots. The potatoes weren't done, and the corned beef was not tender. I didn't change a single thing about the recipe; for all the timing, ingredient amounts, and methods that I stuck to, and the fact that CJ recipes rarely are a miss, but this was a major disappointment. Glad that my husband brought home a gorgeous bakery loaf of Irish soda bread b/c it tasted just marvelous sopping up the broth. The pot's been simmering for 6 hrs. now so I'll just leave it there til the potatoes are edible, but the corned beef's gone to the neighbor's dog.

Simple, savory, and a perfect St. Patrick's Day dinner. Try substituting apple juice for the water. That's what my mom would do. What surprised me most about Chef John's Corned Beef recipe? He did NOT tell us "that spice packet that comes with? Throw it away!" Thank you Chef John not just for the recipe, but more importantly: for the confidence to cook!

Perfect as usual with Chef John recipes! I used a 4 LB Harrington corned beef brisket, flat cut. My only problem was that my pot was too small. I think adding the potatoes and cabbage overcrowded the pot as it took about 1 hr longer to cook the corned beef. I just kept checking the meat every 30 minutes until I didn't feel resistance inserting the fork. Unless I get a bigger Dutch oven, next time I might let the meat finish cooking first and add the potatoes/cabbage to the pot while the meat is resting.

If I am trying something for the first time that I have no idea how to cook, I always search for Chef Johns version first.  I have always done my corned beef in the slow cooker and wanted to try it in my dutch oven, so I was excited to see Chef John had a version!  This turned out perfect!  My beef was about 4.2 lbs and I let it cook just as his instructions state for 4lbs and it turned out amazing!  My family raved over how well everything cooked, and the flavor!  The only thing I did differently was left the carrots out and cooked separately due to space in the pot initially- the potatoes and cabbage were so perfectly cooked and well infused with flavor!  Thank you Chef John!

This was a real hit with my family.  The difference is that I did not have much time, so I cooked it in my pressure cookeR for 1 hour.  Everything was nicely cooked and really tasty. Definitely a "do-again".

Loved the recipe but next time I would not add ANY salt.  The corned beef already salts it up and the extra salt is just too much.  Otherwise a great recipe!!

A group of tourists were visiting a small village in  Ireland and stopped for lunch.  They came across a 95 year old man sitting on a bench in the Town Square.  He claimed to have never been more that a few miles away from the area and a young woman asked "Is it true that you've lived here all your life"?  "Not yet", he replied.
Added a couple of Parsnip cut to 1" pieces with the cabbage.  I bet a lot of different root vegs can be added.

"My husband and I watched the video. We didn't change a thing. Top ratings! We made this together and put the veggies in just when Chef John said to. What can I say?  The meat was done to perfection and very juicy. All veggies were perfectly cooked. The leftovers were great the next day!!!"

This review came from another Chef John fan. I couldn't have said it better! I didn't change a thing.  In fact, I'm licking the plate as I type!!! (I don't give out 5 stars very often, but this one deserves 10 stars.)

Absolutely fantastic.  I look like a genius!  The timing is what's important, and this spells it out beautifully.  I didn't know you need to let meat set for 15 minutes before eating.  Cooked a 4 lb brisket three days ago, it was so good it was gone.  Cooking another one tonight.  Thank you!

I cook my corned beef for 50 minutes per pound and add chopped onion and carrots for the last hour. I add the cabbage with 20-30 minutes remaining. I also sub chicken broth for water. It favors everything nicely.

Chef John, thank you! This was the best corned beef and cabbage I've ever made. Basically I make it once a year for St. Pattys day and I've tried different recipes. They are all kind of similar but I guess the subtle differences make a difference because this was loved by all in my family. Everyone liked it so much that I may just make it again before next year.

Great recipe as written though next time I may double the salt and add pepper. Also I only used a 2.5 lb. brisket, WAY to small. My wife and I devoured it and now there's plenty of veggies left over, but no corned beef!

Over the years, I have tried many different recipes for corned beef and cabbage, but this is the tastiest! Once the potatoes were placed into the pot for cooking, I searched the web for a horseradish sauce recipe since I love boiled potatoes with it. I was happy to find one from Chef John. In my opinion, No need for horseradish on the brisket. It is that good!  Using the left over brisket to make his version of Corned Beef Hash for breakfast tomorrow.

I make corned beef and cabbage a few times a year. It's a simple recipe and I didn't think there was much potential variation to it. I figured I'd try this one since it got such good reviews and I'm a fan of Chef John. However I didn't find this any better or worse than any other recipe I've made. Im not knocking this recipe, but I would just as well be served following the directions on the beef packaging. BTW when making this make sure the meat is really simmering pretty well during the longest part. I didn't and it took longer than the recipe called for before it became tender.

Phenomenal. I added 3 sprigs of fresh thyme and used chicago-style vienna corned beef, because I'm chi-rish. Best corned beef ever.

I made this recipe today.  It was delicious.  The only thing that I changed is that I didn't add any salt and cooked the potatoes for an additional 15 minutes (I live at high altitude).  This recipe is a keeper!!

I made this almost exactly as listed except I had a smaller Corned beef (3 lbs). I cooked it for 50 minutes a pound before adding the potatoes and that seemed to work out about right. I also backed up a bit on everything else in ratio so it would match up to the 3 lb meat. Tasted delicious, tender, juicy and the red potatoes were my favorite. Sooo good and simple. I am glad I watched the video because my cabbage didn't fit into the "broth", and so I was glad he had said that was ok. I will follow this recipe from now on.

I followed the recipe to a "T".  It was probably the best corned beef and cabbage I've ever made.  My family absolutely LOVED it!  This is a keeper.

Chef John, I love the addition of oranges and apples. What a lovely family tradition, your mother must've been a wonderful cook! So I added them and it really makes this recipe special. Also I think RED potatoes are best! ***Especially for those who have not served this traditional Irish recipe, try a side of horseradish as an accoutrement!!!

Excellent! I added some cayenne pepper, garlic, bay leaf, corriander  to it. My meat was pre-seasoned. I staggered the vegetables as suggested and it came out great. My girls loved the broth. SOOOO goood!

This is the standard other Corned beef recipes are compared to. I prefer to add a couple of bottles of beer for part of the water, just my preference. Resting the meat is critical and makes for easier slicing, rather than just having the meat fall apart-even tho theres nothing wrong with that either. Leftovers make for an awesome hash!

This was so easy and it brought back memories of my Mom's St. Patty's day annual dinner.  She is remodeling her kitchen at the moment, and I didn't want to forgo the tradition so I made it at my home and it was just perfect!  This was my first time making this, so I wasn't sure how it would turn out but I know having Chef John as my guide, I could not go wrong.  I served this with some whole grain dijon mustard with wasabi powder for a kick!

I had some broth and veggies left over, so I used them as a base for Chef John's butternut squash soup the next day.  Fantastic!!  Win win!

I made this for St. Patrick's Day and it was delicious!  I did not change any of the ingredients but I did cook the potatoes separately and then added to the corned beef and other vegetables for the last 15 minutes or so.  This was just to save time and space in my pot.  Everyone loved every bite and will make again.

Best corned beef brisket, and cabbage I've ever made!  I have in the past just used the packet of seasonings and this time added the onion , carrots and celery and chicken broth with fabulous results and terrific flavor improvement!  Will definitely do this again next time!

I made this today.  No reason to wait until tomorrow. I originally was going to make it in my slow cooker, but it wasn't large enough so got out the Dutch oven.  I put the potatoes in whole (they were smallish) and at the start as they were in the bottom of the slow cooker already so...  I took the potatoes, carrots, and onion out when done and let the meat go another hour.  Removed the meat and put the cabbage in for 20+ min.  Just B4 the cabbage was done I added back the veggies I wanted heated up ( just enough to feed us - the rest are for tomorrow)  and sliced our portions of corned beef.  Doing it this way made it easy as the meat was resting while the cabbage cooked.  I left out the celery and the salt and didn't miss them.  Used a light beer as that is what we had.  Will definitely be making this again, and not waiting until next March.  Thx Chef John!!!  Another winner

Liked it, but nothing outstanding to make it better than a standard recipe.    This was how my grandma made it.   The quality of the meat makes the difference.

Did not make any changes. Will not likely make it again as I didn't like the texture of the corned beef or the flavour of it with the cloves

Broke the Cardinal rule. First time making this dish and invited friends to be the guinea pigs. It was fantastic. Everyone raved. So easy to make and tasted so good. Followed recipe to the "t" this way if it was a flop, then I didn't have to be accountable it was all on Chef John! Kudos to Chef John!

So yummy! Here's a tip - buy low sodium as a healthier option, you can't taste the difference. Also I liked serving with apple cider vinegar and grey poupon course ground mustard. Definitely a super yummy recipe. Amt of time cooked was perfect.

I will definitely make this again.  I will reduce the 3 quarts of water to two and follow the directions as written.  However, I feel that horseradish is the way to go with this meat!  I am not going to wait for St Patrick’s Day to make this.  It’s that good!!

I give it only 3 stars because I knew that the carrots, would have been mush if they'd been included at the start of cooking the corned beef.

I took my 5-1/2 lb. corned beef, placed it in a LARGE pot and covered it with equal amounts of Shiner beer and beef broth. I also added a couple of bay leaves, a couple of tablespoons of pickling spice, salt, pepper and several other spices that escape me just now.

3-1/2 hours later, with the internal temperature of the corned beef at 165 degrees, I added the carrots, potatoes and celery, let them cook for 30 more minutes and then added the cabbage and let it steam for 15 minutes.

EXCELLENT corned beef and the vegetables had a little firmness, not like mush if you put them in at the start of cooking...

It was awesome! This will be my go to recipe for corned beef and cabbage. The meat was fork tender. The only change I made was to use a whole pound of baby carrots. 

I was concerned about the vegetables overcooking, but they were perfect. I think the trick was to only simmer and never let it boil (which could toughen the meat).

I finally made this dish for the first time last night. Usually I'm not a huge fan of my own cooking (I'm not a bad cook I'm just done with the meal by the time it's done). Anyway, this was so good. I made a brown sugar and honey mustard topping and broiled that as suggested by someone else. So yummy. Even my kids ate this dish and they are not fans of potatoes, onions and carrots! I'll admit I forgot to add the cabbage but I was out of room at that point. But seriously, loved this dish, I just wish the meat wasn't $20 a package!

This was my first attempt at corned beef and cabbage. Wow! The meat turned out so tender and the veggies and broth were delicious! I did tweak it just a bit (sorry for those of you who get mad at this, but really, I did stick with the original recipe, just switched/added a couple of things!) I added garlic and instead of celery I used parsnips. And instead of using water, I used beef bone broth. But stuck to everything else. I could’ve eaten the whole pot by myself!!! The fam loved it. Thank you do much for the recipe and the video instructions!!

I followed this recipe to the letter -- something I rarely do -- and I am beyond disappointed with the result.  It really was as tough as shoe leather. This was for a St. Patrick's day dinner. It ended up being a veggie feast. The undisputed star was the Irish soda bread my teen made.

I made this today, St Patricks day 2019, and was very happy.  In the past I always made corned beef in the oven and it was pretty good.  This time I  wanted the boiled cabbage, potatoes  and broth along with it so I went with this recipe and I thought it was excellent.  I didn't change a thing.

I made this with a 2.5 lb brisket following the instructions to the letter & it turned out beautifully. I paired it with a loaf of soda bread ( of course not forgetting the green libations ) & it is definitely going to be my "go - to" St. Patrick's corned beef recipe  for now on :)

This is, of course, absolutely delicious.  My family only wants me to make corned beef this way now.  I knew it would be great because everything I've made from Chef John is great!  Now, when I search for a recipe, I type in "Chef John" first.

I will make it again. I used a 3-lb. brisket, so took about 45 minutes off the simmering process. I added more carrots and potatoes than was called for in the recipe.

I just added white turnip instead of potatoes. This first time, I wanted to follow my favourite Chef John's recipe exactly (exept for the potatoes) to see how it turned out. Awesome as usual. We had this yesterday, so I didn't get pics :( but I'll get pics when I make it next. Thanks Chef John!

I grew up on this from my grandma and my kids have grown up on it. But she always put in mustard and Worcestershire. Gives it a little more flavor.

This was the tenderest most juicy corned beef we’ve ever had. The only thing I changes was by substituting a bottle of Guinness beer for some of the water.

This was the best corned beef I have ever made or ever tasted.  I had trouble keeping it at a simmer(my stove's problem),  so, consequently, I had to cook the potatoes and cabbage a little longer before they were tender.   Worth the wait.  Wonderful!

This recipe was a slight variation to my usual recipe, and it was excellent.  Will be my go-to from now on.  Everyone loved it!!  Paired with our family recipe for Soda Bread.  A winning combo.

Fantastic meal. I cooked all but the cabbage and potatoes about 3  hours on a very low simmer. Added the potatoes for 30 minutes. Removed the meat and covered to rest. Held the veggies warm in a bowl in the microwave. Then cooked the cabbage about 20 minutes in the same pot.
Thanks Chef John.

I made this for my husband. I haven't eaten much corned beef, and it's not really my cup of tea. My husband said this was just okay. I made the recipe as written. If I made it again, I'd add more carrots.

Thanks Chef John.  I've been making this for years and the meat was never as tender as it is now after seeing your video and making some essential changes.  This is my best corned beef and I know my family will be thrilled when dinnertime rolls around.

Followed the recipe to the Tee, except that instead of the Dutch Oven I used the Crock Pot on high for 7 hours. Honestly, it turned out fabulous! But If you use the crock pot cut back on the water.

My family has  been enjoying this recipe for generations.  However, ......Chef John what are you thinking by cooking the carrots for hours?  Yikes!  People  put carrots in pot same time as the potatoes.   
Trying to make cooked carrot haters of us all??:)

I make this every year for our annual St. Paddy's party.  There's never been any leftovers.  Very easy to make.  I've done it in a slow cooker, as well as a dutch oven.  Both come out wonderful.

Pretty straight forward recipe.  I added about 6 cloves of fresh garlic to mine along with leaving the fat on.   Also added half a stick of butter.  It made the broth very rich and garlicy.  So good.

Wonderful. I used beef stock to replace 2 of the 3 qts of water. The resulting broth was almost as good as the tender cornbeef.

The longer it cooked the better it tasted.  I cooked it in the crock pot and added garlic, old Bay and other items to get some better flavor.

Think I might have cooked the beef a bit too long (pilot error on my part) but was really good.  I love most every Chef John recipe.

The cornbeef was excellent. I used two cans of beef broth in addition to the water to give it more flavor, and I excluded the extra salt. In addition, I had to cook the cabbage longer than suggested. Otherwise, I followed the recipe and it came out very tasty.

Recipe doesn't say, but be sure to rinse the meat so it won't be too salty when you cook it. I actually also soaked it for a couple hrs to get most of the salt out. I also didn't add any salt while cooking.

Followed recipe exactly and it is absolutely the best I have ever had.  Great flavors, potatoes and cabbage not mushy, corned beef firm and tender.  Heading out to buy more briskets.

I made some changes and loved the result.  Used a bottle of Guinness beer and water, added all of the vegetables (except the cabbage) at the same time, used cheesecloth and some spices (peppercorns, mustard seeds, bay leaves) into a bundle.  My corned beef didn't come with a spice packet.  The flavors were incredible!  I plan to make corned beef this way again...next St. Patrick's Day.      :-)

I have made this several times and it is always great! This time I added 1/2 beef broth and 1/2 water. It was still very good. Thanks for the recipe Chef John. I use a lot of your recipes!!   :)

I have usually made corned beef in a crock pot but I ran out of time.  This was a faster way to cook and it came out pretty much the same.  Very tasty!

After cooking a solid six hours, the fork finally found a little tenderness and I added my red potatoes.  An hour later I rested the beef and ate some of the delicious potatoes & carrots.   I blame the cut of meat - 3 1/2 pound, because Chef John can do no wrong in my eyes.
*Update!  I changed rating to 4 stars after heating up my corned beef for lunch.  Even though it took 7 hours it was DELISH!

I've made this twice now.  It is just simply very good.  I didn't change a thing.  The first time, I let simmer for 4-5 hours.  The meat was fork-tender and delectable.  The second time, I only had 2-2.5 hours, as high as possible without boiling over.  It wasn't as tender, but it was tender enough.  So...the longer the better, in my opinion.

Chef John does it again!  So simple and yet so good. Funny how it seems that my usual recipe isn't much different, but never quite turned out this well. 
Followed recipe but added more carrots and no potatoes.  I will use this recipe from now on.

Delicious! Another outstanding recipe Chef John - thank you. Even my ultra picky Father-In-Law enjoyed it, which in and of itself is quite an accomplishment! Most people have picky children - I have a 93 yr old retired career military  "picky child" ;)
Not sure where Janeelizalove got the clove idea from but certainly not in the directions since Chef John did not have them in his ingredient(s) list nor cooking instructions. Either she got her corned beef recipes confused or just good old operator error. 
Whichever it may be, the posted recipe as written, is well worth making - try it, you'll like it.

I really like this but made a couple of changes. This does NOT need salt but it does need pepper. I doubled all veggies except potatoes. I used low sodium chicken broth instead of water. I pan seared the cabbage then baked for 30 minutes at 350 on a wire rack with a sheet pan filled with dark beer under to steam instead of adding to the broth. After the meat rested, I topped with 2 T Dijon Mustard mixed with 1 T maple syrup and broiled for 3 minutes. My Irish grandmother actually made almost this identical recipe with the changes I added. Very good recipe.

This was delicious and a great basic corned beef recipe!  Will definitely use again.  It's worth the long cook time on the weekend.

The last couple times my wife and I have made corned beef, the results have been terrible.  Dry, tasteless meat, plain potatoes, very disappointing.  The odd thing is we didn't do much different, but following this recipe was a complete success!  This turned out amazing.

I enjoyed this meal very much it was tasty and easy to make on a busy night. The meat turned out tender and moist. The vegetables were cooked just right and not mushy or too crisp. I had a 2.2# tripoint and added 10 minutes to the cooking time.  My corned beef was also cured in the old fashioned method and not with the addition of any spice packet.  The spice leaching from the beef had enough flavor without additions. I will recommend this to others without hesitation. Thank you Chef John!

This dish worked very well for me, and I ate it all by myself with the smallest cut of corned beef I could find, ended up have it for lunch and dinner too.

I have to agree with so many of the other reviewers.  This was the best and easiest Corned Beef and Cabbage recipes I ever prepared and enjoyed.  There was no greasy taste.  I made it yesterday and dinner tonight was perfect leftovers.  Thanks

This is the second time I made it-exactly by the recipe (perhaps with a few more potatoes to satisfy the Irish in me) and it is officially a family favorite!
