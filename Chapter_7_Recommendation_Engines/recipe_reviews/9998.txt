Divine!  These are the best peanut butter cookies!  I've made it this way and also with 1 tsp of vanilla extract.  Either way these are soo peanut buttery and rich.  My mom can't get enough of these either.  One thing I would make note of is that this recipe doesn't make very much.  I highly recommend doubling the amounts.

I brought these cookies to the rehibilitation center that I volunteer at, and no one would believe me, when I told them their was no flour added. They totaly thought I was lying. I did make some slight changes to the recipe,however.I added 1/2 cup sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1tsp vanilla, and 1/2 tsp baking soda. To make short, these peanutbutter cookies are THE BEST!

Shockingly tasty!
Guido watches his sugar & we are both border-line porky, so a flourless cookie is just the ticket. I used organic PB from our favorite store (Costco), Splenda, egg and a splash of Pure Vanilla. I didn't flatten the first batch (got the idea from the reviews that they spread) well, those first ones were ball cookies! Next 3 batches I did the fork dipped in Splenda thing, and the results were delightful. I doubled recipe and it made 4 large trays of smallish cookies.
HAVE A DRINK NEARBY- our cookies needed a chaser!

This recipe was great. I'm on a low carb diet so I used Splenda instead of sugar and they still came out great plus very low in carbs.

Very yummy! Hubby said they were the best P.B cookies he's ever had.  I followed the advise of another review and relpaced the cup of white sugar w/ 1/4 white and 1/2 brown sugar and added a splash (teaspoon) of vanila. I also made them bite sized. 
Thx for a family fav!

These cookies are 5-star cookies when made right. I gave the recipe 4 stars for lack of specificity. There are a few things that need to happen for these cookies to be delicious.

1. Use the right kind of peanut butter. Natural peanuts-only peanut butter just won't give the right consistency or flavor. Use a conventional peanut butter or a no-stir natural one (the kind with palm oil added for emulsification). 

2. Add a little salt, ESPECIALLY if your peanut butter is unsalted. This makes a world of difference in flavor.

3. Be sure to use a large or extra-large egg. 

4. Use less sugar! This goes along with #3 above. Too much sugar in a recipe will cause the egg not to set which leads to a runny mess on your cookie sheet. 3/4 cup of sugar is more than enough to make the cookies super sweet but still allows the egg to set properly.

If you take all these things into account, these cookies will knock your socks off! I used crunchy peanut butter, 3/4 cup of brown sugar, a pinch of salt and one large egg and I was SO in love with these. In fact, I liked them WAY more than conventional peanut butter cookies. These are peanut butter heaven.

These are the best cookies in the world! I love them with a big glass of ice cold milk! I make them with 1/2 c Splenda instead of sugar. I use Kraft smooth peanut butter. I also like to use crunchy peanut butter. I don't use light peanut butter because I find it is too sweet. These are also good with some chocolate chips or raisins.

Pretty good.  I added three tbs of flour and 1/2 a tps of vanilla.  Sort of defeats the "no flour" idea, but necessary. I wonder if two eggs might make them a bit less "fragile." I rolled them into balls the size of quarters.  Cooked them until splits appear. That are perfect bite-size treats that way!

I made these on a camping trip this past week-very easy w/so few ingredients.  The recipe I had w/me (I thought it was this one, but apparently not) called for 1/2C sugar and they were plenty sweet.  All I had was reduced fat PB and they were still yummy.  Not the BEST PB cookie, but great in a pinch w/so few ingredients.

I made these today and they are FABulous!!!  Here's what I did:  I doubled the recipe, which means I used two cups of peanut butter (basically, one jar), two eggs, and one cup sugar (3/4 white, and 1/4 brown).  I did add a tsp of vanilla, and about 1/2 tsp of baking powder, for fear they might run all over the pan.  They did not - I think they would be fine with out the baking powder.  
I used natural peanut butter, and poured the oil off the top without mixing it in.  This made for a perfect, and I mean perfect, cookie consistency - moist on the inside, but not runny in the least.  The taste is salty/sweet, which I love!  I made them into a ball form for the cookie sheets, and they only flattened a bit, for a perfect, round cookie shape (didn't press them with a fork).  I can hardly stop eating them.  Will most definitely make them many times again.  Even my husband likes them, and he doesn't like peanut butter.  Thanks for this great recipe!!!

This is an excellent recipe. I highly recommend doing half white / half brown sugar, adding 1/2 tsp baking powder (powder seems to work better than baking soda for this recipe), and 1 tsp. vanilla. Perfect.  This recipe is great as is, but they fall apart very easy if you don't add the baking powder. Hope this helps. Enjoy.

These were dang good!  As is, they work, but they're even better with a few variations.  Here's what I did:
2 eggs
1 cup PB (I prefer chunky)
1/4 cup white sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 tsp vanilla
1/2 tsp baking soda

When you put them on the pan, press a checkerboard with a fork, and sprinkle a little white sugar on top.  Bake them as directed.  When you take them out they might now seem quite done, and very soft.  Let them just sit on the pan to cool before attempting to move them. Fantastic!  If you want something extra great, use this filling: Cream 3 tablespoons butter or margarine with 1 cup confectioners' sugar, 1/2 cup smooth peanut butter, and 2T milk. Spread filling onto half of the cooled cookies, then top with the other half to form sandwiches.

Can't believe these don't have flour!  I followed others suggestions and here's what I did for a double batch (which made 43 cookies - about 2 inches in diameter).  2 c. PB, 2 eggs, 1 c. white sugar, 1/2 c. brown sugar, 2 tsp. vanilla, 1 tsp. baking soda.  Mix by hand, dropped on to cookie sheet.  I used a sugared fork to make the criss-cross pattern and baked for 6 min at 350.  Took out after 6 min. and added 3 mini Hershey's kisses (sold in baking aisle).  Added back to oven and cooked for another 2 min.  Superb!

Well I tried these for my wheat allergic daughter.  She loved them.  I thought they were a bit to sugary.  I tried it with 2 egss and 1tsp. vannila and a 1/4 cup unsweetend coco powder.  Much better.....

Honestly I thought these were horrible.  The cooking time was not long enough so they were not done in the middle, and it really didn't taste like a cookie.  It just tastes like a hunk of peanut butter and sugar.  Even my husband hated them and he loves peanut butter.  Will not make these again.

I've been using this recipe for years. These cookies are always in our cookie jar now. For those who complain about them being crumbly it's the cook time. These cookies are really hard to tell when done- it seems they either burn or undercook. It usually takes a couple of tries to know your oven's effect on this recipe. Also be sure to cool, but remove from tray while cookies are still warm. Smaller cookies = less mess.  I also like to press these down with the bottom of a glass lightly dipped in sugar. Hats off to this recipe!

I love to cook and bake so when I found this recipe I was a bit disappointed.  The ingredients are minimal and the recipe is easy!  I'm glad I decided to go with an easier recipe.  These cookies are just as good-if not better than any other more complicated recipe.  I double the recipe and added the vanila (1tsp) and they turned out delicious!  However, I did have a bit of a struggle getting them from the sheet to the cooling rack.  My solution-let them sit on the cookie sheet for an extra minute or so to "set" before trying to move them.  I baked mine for 10 minutes, pressed with a fork, and then baked for another 2-3 minutes.  They tasted fantastic!

This was a great recipe to start from. These cookies were absolutely delicious. However, after sifting through hundreds of reviews, here are my changes. I used 1 cup of Skippy Natural peanut butter. I'm assuming that whatever kind of peanut butter you use will effect the way these cookies come out. I also only used 3/4 of sugar all together...1/2C white & 1/4C brown. I added 1 tsp of vanilla. I didn't add baking powder because I couldn't find it in my pantry. It made about 16 cookies that were about 2 inches across. Lot's of people said they don't spread, but I rolled mine in my palm then pushed a fork in to them, not completely flattening them, and they turned out perfect. I am a firm believer in parchment paper. Line the cookie sheet with it. It will keep them from burning and make them much easier to move to the cooling rack. I cooked them at 350 for 10 minutes exactly...and they were perfect with zero burning. Leave them on the cookie sheet for at least 5 minutes before transferring to the cooling rack...and move the cookies on the parchment paper to cooling rack. Don't take them off the paper...it will make for an easier clean up. These turned out moist, gooey, and super rich!! LOVE THEM!! And if you like peanut butter, you will too!! Hope yours turn out as good as mine :)

Very good!!! The first time I made it they were very good but too sweet so I cut down half way on the sugar the second time and they were PERFECT!!
Brown sugar would add a nice touch too.
Thanks, such an easy recipe.. Anyone can make these!

I made these for my wheat allergic child.  I like them; and they definitely grow on you.  I discovered that (with Adam's PB) they are flat when the dough is room temp, and puffy if the dough is chilled.

These are the best peanut butter cookies ever but if you want to save calories try stevia it tastes great and is not a neurotoxin like splenda.

These were great. I'd give them 4.5 stars if I could. I didn't give them 5 because I did add a tsp. or vanilla and a dash of cinnamon. I used Simply Jif creamy which has lower sodium and lower sugar. I used all white sugar as the recipe stats. I topped some of them with a chocolate chunk, some with white chocolate chips, and left some plain. All delicious. Super easy!!

Sorry, we did not like this cookie.  Way too much sugar which made it grainy.  They were flat once cooled.  After the first batch went flat, I tried different things - chilling dough, not flattening with a fork, etc and they all ended up the same way.  The taste was extremely peanutty, if you like that, which we do.  BTW, I rated this recipe after baking as written.  Recipes should not be rated 5 stars if you change or add ingredients.  That is called a new recipe.

First, let me say that these are cute and relatively tasty peanut butter cookies. Nothing super-special, but nice. This cookie recipe uses teaspoonfuls of dough, Good Lord! This recipe made 55 cookies as written! 6 servings? I guess 9 cookies per person is a serving. (about right for me!)

This is similar to the recipe on the back of the Kraft Peanut Butter jar.  I made them last night and had to make another batch tonight.  I am totally addicted.  The Kraft recipe calls for only 1/2 cup sugar and to bake at 325 for 15 minutes.  They are the most delectable cookie ever!

This recipe was very peanut buttery, but I had to bake them for 12 minutes, otherwise they were raw in the middle, also I would recommend rolling them and then flattening, just dropping them made a very lumpy cookie.

I've tried flourless peanut butter cookies and they are the best! For those of you who are watching your sugar intake I suggest you use 1/2 cup of Splenda Low calorie Sweetner instead of 1 cup of sugar.  You won't miss a thing.. it is absolutely delicious.  Do not use Equal, Nutra Sweet etc.. Aspartame is not a good sugar substitute in baked goods. It must be Splenda (Saccharin).  A must TRY!

Super easy and gluten free! I used a cookie scoop and then used a fork once for the lines. I got 13 cookies total. Enough for two people, but not so many that they just sit around the house!

They taste like peanut butter fudge.  We added chocolate chips to the tops after we smooshed the cookies on to the baking sheet.  Very easy, but they are dense and tend to crumble in your hands if you're  not careful.

Easy Easy Easy!
I wanted to make my first peanut butter cookies (I don't care much for peanut butter thus not part of my recipe box) and these seemed so easy I had to try them.  I did change up the sugar to 1/4 cup white and 1/4 cup brown and a half tsp. vanilla (because I am such a vanilla person.)  
I rolled these into walnut size balls and then after on my pan (covered with parchment) I used a fork and pressed them down a bit.
They don't spread so that is important to keep in mind before you cook - thin or thick cookie?  I cooked them for a minute or so longer than suggested and they came out fine (maybe a tad brown on bottom) but my husband really liked them.  I did try a bite and thought they were very peanut buttery but the consistancy is good and they are attractive cookies.  My dad tried a couple and thought they were harder than he would have liked so we put them in the micro for a few seconds and he liked them much better.
I can only say if you want to make a cookie for someone that loves peanut butter and you want the easiest recipe you have ever tried then this is it!

So easy and quick, and they turn out quite tasty! I accidentally bought the honey flavored peanut butter, and it was divine in this recipe. When baking cookies, I always swap out a portion of white sugar for brown sugar because I find my cookies turn out moister that way, so I did half white and half brown for this. Heaven!

I used 1/2 cashew butter and 1/2 almond butter (due to peanut allergy) and added 1 tsp baking powder based off of a similar recipe!  i made them mainly for my gluten free husband, but i loved them too, especially with a few chocolate chips on top.  Note i've made several times now, don't expect this to be like your usual cookie dough... it is pretty sticky (i posted a picture of the dough) i also roll them in a little white sugar before pressing them with the classic #. This makes for a nice crispy outside.  Let them cool for a few minutes after you take them out of the oven and they will crisp up! bake at 350 for exactly 11 minutes (or so) and then let them sit for 5 -10 minutes.  I made my cookies small and got 30! wonderful!

Yum! a great recipe for the kids to help with, i followed the directions exactly but found the addition of vanilla and cinnamon helped.i made a double recipe with 3 T of flour, made them easier to roll and less crumbley , but with or w/o flour they are great. chunky PB is good , i made a double batch w/  1/2 smooth & 1/2 crunchy, all the variations were  YUM! i make this alot, and used it for a bake sale, hated to see them go.

having a gluten allergy sucks sometimes... but this recipe makes me feel like i'm not missing out!! I've made this one for a long time as written. Most recently, after looking at reviews, I made some changes and made the best batch yet! Here is what I did: 1 c PB, 1/2 c Brown Sugar, 1/4 c White Sugar, 2 pinches of baking powder, 1 egg, 1/4 gluten-free all purpose flour. They are still gluten free and that little addition of flour and baking powder make them feel like a non-gf cookie! I made them kisses cookies by using a medium cookie scoop and pressing a kiss into them before I baked at 350 for 12 minutes.

Delicious!  Really the best peanut butter cookie we have ever had.  And on top of that it is SIMPLE to make!  3 ingredients??!  No one would guess!  I have tried all the variations suggested, but there is little to no difference.  So I follow the recipe to the letter.  My suggestion?  Triple or quadruple the recipe.  We freeze the extra (if there is any).  And, don't over cook them!  They may not look done when you take them out, but they are.  Wonderful and simple recipe!  Can't speak highly enough about it.  Thanks!

My husband wanted peanut butter cookies and I have never made them before, so I tried this recipe first.  Understanding that one of the main ingredients was sugar, I knew that it was going to be really sweet.  They were extremely soft and very peanut buttery, but they had an almost sandy/gritty texture, which was all the sugar this recipe calls for.  I would say if you love a soft EXTREMELY sweet/sugary peanut butter cookie, this is the recipe for you.  However, if you're like my husband and I who don't like to crunch on sugar, look else where.  I will not be making this recipe again.

I've got to admit, at first I was skeptical about this recipe being flourless but I decided to try it anyways. This was such a simple and fast recipe! It is so very good and chewy.  I did follow some of the advice given in the comments, and I added a splash of vanilla extract. This is definately a cookie I will be making in the near future =)

I was going to sumbit this recipe but I found it here. These are great cookies to make with the kids because they are so easy and quick to make, the only messy part is measuring the peanut butter(so you may want to measure that out instead of letting the kids do it :)). The dough is very pliable so it's great to make fun shapes with, just remember to make the shapes smaller than you actually want them to turn out because the dough expands quite a bit. We've made tons of shapes like houses, cars and people, of course the best part is eating them!

I used light peanut butter and only 1/2 cup of sugar.  (1/4 cup white, 1/4 cup brown). I also added 1 tsp of vanilla.  I used the 1 egg as indicated in the recipe.  I rolled them into 1 inch balls and pressed them down with a fork dipped in warm water. I lined my cookie sheet with parchment paper and baked at 325 F for 15 minutes.  Yummy.... And no flour!!!

As suggested from others, I doubled the recipe and added 1/2cup of almond flour. Topped with chocolate drizzle and it looked like I bought it from a bakery!!! It is awesome !!!

Simple and a great recipe for gluten intolerant people. I drizzled melted chocolate over finished cookies.

Wow.  Um, wow.  I had these cookies out of the oven faster than if I had gone to the store and back to buy cookies.  I did take a few ideas from other reviewers to incorporate 1/4 brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar (I used splenda actually), a 1/2 tsp baking soda, and 1 tsp of vanilla extract.  I also threw in a small pinch of salt to balance out the sweet.  I'm glad I did NOT use an entire cup of sugar.  These are just... wow.  Thank you for sharing!!  So excited to have found this recipe.

I recently found out I have a wheat intolerance. I was excited when I found this recipe. It is great! I added a little vanilla extract because I thought it would give it a nice touch (hopefully that doesn't have wheat in it...didn't think about that till now). I also had to bake my cookies for 12 minutes (could have been a little longer) because I made them a little bigger than the "teaspoonful" suggested in the recipe. I will definitley be making these again!

WAY too much sugar!  I used all natural peanut butter without salt or sugar added. If I made these again, I would use half the sugar.

I used this recipe as inspiration.  It's hard to follow it as written when there are so many good suggestions!  I used 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  I added a dash of salt and splash of vanilla.  I used one egg yolk added to the wet ingredients.  I whipped 2 egg whites separately and then folded those into the heavier ingredients.  It yielded 2 1/2 dozen cookies that were thin and chewy.  Had to increase the cook time to 13 minutes and then let cool fully on the sheet.  They were well received by a gluten-free friend.

Made these for my DH for Christmas.  He loved them!  They have a very rich peanut butter flavor and were a huge  hit.  I don't really care for peanut butter cookies and even I enjoyed them.  This is my go to peanut butter cookie recipes.

I have wanted to try flourless Peanut Butter Cookies since I first heard about them, about 10 years ago. I’ve read numerous reviews over the years about this type of cookie, both good and bad, e.g. too flat, too sweet, too crumbly, batter was too soft, etc. I wanted to increase the yield so I tweaked the recipe somewhat. Since I had a new jar of regular Skippy PB (not natural), and I also wanted to use up the entire jar, here’s what I did: I used 1 (16.3 ounce) jar of Skippy PB (approximately 1 3/4 cups), 1 large egg plus 1 large egg white, 3/4 cup white sugar, 3/4 cup packed brown sugar, 2 tsp. vanilla, 1 tsp. baking powder, and 1/8 tsp. salt. Combined everything completely, and scooped the dough with a 1 1/4 inch scoop onto a parchment paper lined cookie sheet (didn’t bother to roll them), flattened with a fork dipped in sugar (crisscross pattern) and baked 8 minutes @ 350 degrees. Keep an eye on them though; my oven seems to run a bit hot. Let them sit on the cookie sheet, to cool, for at least 5 minutes or they may fall apart. They did spread out to about 2 1/2 inches after baking. I got 60 of the absolute BEST Peanut Butter Cookies I’ve ever made, or eaten… HANDS DOWN! Thank you, Stephanie, for posting the recipe.

I was so shocked you can make AMAZING cookines with only 3 ingredients. I did add 1/2 teaspoon baking soda and 3/4 cup of sugar and peanuts.. The best peanut butter cookies I have ever made.. I'll make these again for sure.. The batter made me eight large cookies and it took exactly 10 mins to bake.. So YUMMY nice and warm... Don't forget the milk, you will need it the cookies are so rich..

=)

These were ok. The flavor was good, but the consistency was off (though that is to be expected since there's no flour). An easy gluten-free recipe that doesn't require alternative types of flour.

These were okay.  I used natural PB (no salt or sugar added).  I found these cookies to be way too sweet without enough PB flavor.  The sugar overpowered the PB.  I think these would be better with brown sugar, maybe 1/2 cup packed.  I'll keep the recipe because it's GF (familly member avoids gluten) but it needs some work.

These are not only delicious, but also the absolute easiest cookies in the world!   If you want to teach your children to make a cookie from scratch, this is a great place to start, because the recipe is easy to remember (only three ingredients!) and they are simple to mix.   If you decide you're in the mood for a peanut butter cookie, these can be on a plate with a glass of milk on the side in about 15-20 minutes!  I make them exactly as written with no changes, and they come out perfect every time.

"As is" I would rate these 3 stars, but I'm giving them 5 for several reasons. 1) they are the easiest cookies you will ever make. In less than 15 you have cookies! 2) the texture is perfect. 3) this could be the best starter recipe ever. They are missing something, but add vanilla/cinnamin, oats, M&Ms, chocolate chips or whatever else you like and you can't stop eating them. Mine needed to cook closer to 12 mins

Very good for just 3 ingredients, an awesome cookie to make in between shopping days. I tweaked mine a bit by adding a teaspoon of vanilla and used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar and a pinch of salt. However made either way, they are delicious.

Added three tbsp of flour and a splash of vanilla - the cookies don't spread that much, so don't be afraid to put them close together on the cookie sheet - and do use a fork to flatten it out.

I love this recipe! It is the one off the back of the kraft jar. The difference with this one is the full cup of sugar...kraft had only 1/2 cup listed. I made a low fat version. I used kraft whipped peanut butter (on 70 cal per tbsp) 1/2 cup sugar and 2 egg whites instead of the whole egg. I also sprinkled a lil flour in the batter so it wasnt as sticky and I could put it on the cookie sheet. I presses them flat with a fork and cooked for 15 mins. These were YUMMM!!!  The whole family gobbled them up and couldnt believe they were low fat! YUM YUM YUM!

Awesome recipe! So good and so easy. Love how these are gluten free and they are so so easy to make sugar free too! I used 1 cup organic peanut butter, half a cup organic stevia and 1 organic egg. I think they are plenty sweet enough with half a cup, a full cup of sugar/stevia isn't necessary. My new go-to peanut butter cookie recipe, thanks Stephanie!

So yummy and so easy!  My son found this recipe and it became an instant family favorite!  We always have the ingredients on hand and it can be whipped up in an instant!  I'm sure the recipe could be embellished, but I think it's perfect as is. Plus, it's gluten free which is exactly what we needed!  Thank you so much!!!

This is an excellent recipe for very peanut buttery, soft, chewy yummy cookies! I love that I had all the ingredients in my cupboard, and they were quick. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I did not care for this recipe at all.  Maybe it was the peanut butter I use ("just peanuts")?  Tastes like sugar and peanut butter pasted together, and the cookies crumble easily.  Too bad.

I'm 67 and have baked and tasted a lot of cookies along the way. I'm not easily impressed. Well, I'm impressed!! :-) Stephanie, how on earth could anybody come up with the concept of a cookie with no flour? Sounds almost profane! LOL They were delicious. My grown son tried one and stated "Now that's a for real peanut butter cookie!" They were soft, moist and the peanut butter taste was amazing, pure and undiluted.I had reduced the sugar by 1/2, 1/4 c white and 1/4 c light brown, used a heaping regular coffee spoon to measure amount and crisscrossed with a fork dipped in white sugar. They baked 10 minutes because of their size and cooled for 10 minutes before I took them off the sheet. I wound up with 14 good sized cookies. Great. Thanks again, Stephanie!

Awesome! Had I not made these cookies myself, I would not have believed that they only used 3 ingredients.   However, I did add a few tablespoons of flour to thicken up the dough. I think that the size of your egg and the type of peanut butter may vary, and therefore you may/may not need a bit of flour. Great recipe!

Oh! These are so wonderful. They are soft, sweet, perfectly perfect. My kids gobbled them up. All I can say is double the batch because one isn't enough. I doubled the batch, and used 1/2 Splenda. So instead of doing 2 cups of sugar, I used 1 1/2 c. sugar and 12 packs of Splenda (equals 1/2 c. sugar). This cuts back on some of the sugar so mom can indulge in these treats too!

I've been using this recipe for years but this time I was at a friend's and made a batch for his "empty" cookie jar.  He only had "Kirkland" smooth peanut butter from Costco so I used that.  By far, the best tasting EVER!  I added 1/2 tsp. vanilla and 1/2 tsp. baking soda.  I always put the dough in the fridge (at least 15 minutes) to make the cookies set better.  If you've ever had a PB cookie from "Togo's", these will definitely remind you of them! -- UDATE: Added Reeses Peaunut Butter Chips that last couple of times - WINNER-WINNER-WINNER RECIPE~

Very yummy. My boyfriend ate a bunch and was very surprised to learn they were flourless. He said they tasted like normal PB cookies. I added a tsp or so of cinnamon, as I do most of my cookie recipes to bring out the flavors. Will replace my regular PB cookie recipe because it's much easier, cheaper and there isn't much of a difference in taste. THANKS!!

They were burnt on the bottom before they were cooked through, and tasteless to boot. I did a trial run of one dozen, and 11 of them are going straight to the trash.

These cookies are very simple and quite good; I followed the suggestions of several other reviewers and used 1/2 cup of white sugar, and a 1/2 cup of brown sugar, added 1 t. of vanilla, and 2 T. of flour.  Rolled into 16 balls and then pressed halfway down with fork dipped in sugar; made a crisscross pattern.

I baked at 350 for 12 minutes on the highest rack.  Removed from oven and let set for 2-3 minutes, then removed from pan and let cool.

Let these cookies cool completely before moving them, or else they're too crumbly. Even better, refrigerate them overnight before eating. Much chewier and better that way.

Difficult to tell when they are done because they stay soft until they cool down.  Burned them as a result.  Do not think either me or my husband would like them if they weren't burned due to the different texture and flavor. Probably won't try this one again.

These cookies came out great.  It is important to use a little vanilla.  This recipe made 16 cookie.  I smashed it down with my 3 middle fingers.  On the last 8 cookies I did something different.  I thumbprinted them and filled the hole with jelly.  They came out wonderful.  Do bake them for 10 minutes, 8 was not long enough.  I hope you enjoy them as much as my family did.
Thanks

Yum!  I don't know why I doubt you guys!  It seemed too simple...delicious!  Used 1 cup creamy JIF and 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.  Came out great.  Will sprinkle sugar on top of the next batch!  Made 18 cookies, used the small melon baller from pampered chef!  Can't wait for the boys to wake up to try the 2nd batch!

I notice a few people mention that they have made these for friends with celiacs. Please pay CLOSE attention to what brand of peanut butter you use. I have a couple of friends with celiac, and they can only eat certain brands of peanut butter as some brands have traces of gluten in them.

These cookies are great.  No flour needs to be added, leave the recipe alone!  I would add one step, which I think will make people feel more confident that the cookies will stay together:

Form the dough into balls and then flatten criss cross style with the tines of a fork.

Also, for the record, I think the generic peanut butters don't taste as good as Jiff.

I grew up with a similar recipe, used this one in college, and just tried it again recently(repeating it tonight), and these are everything I've always wanted in a peanut butter cookie. Occasionally, I have to adjust the cooking time to accommodate for the relative humidity of my kitchen, but they're always spot-on! Chewy and delicious! I've also added cocoa powder, and they taste like a peanut butter cup cookie, without the melty mess of chocolate!

I know some of you can't stand when anyone rates a rescipe after changing it but I followed the advice of others and these turned out yummy! My man was shocked and praised me over and over! 
A cup of PB, 1/2 c packed brown sugar, 1/4 c white sugar, 1/2 tsp vanilla, one large egg and a dash of salt. Cooked 8-10 min...awesome! I will always make them this way from now on!

The only change I've made to these is to do 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown, then add a tsp of Vanilla. The brown sugar make them a little smoother. I ALWAYS make a double batch, because one is never enough!

I have been wanting to make these for so long and I couldnt believe how good they were. I added 1 tsp. of vanilla. Wow, these are so easy and chewy, and yummy, with just a few ingredients, you can't go wrong.

I followed another reviewer's suggestion and reduced the sugar to 3/4 c. (1/2 c. white and 1/4 c. brown) and added 1/2 t. baking soda and some vanilla.  I was pleasantly surprised to find out that the cookies did not fall apart, and they were delicious!  In fact, that's the drawback - I can't stop eating them!

Quite heavy and overly sweet. They worked fine for my purposes (cookie crumbles) but I can't see making these as a stand-in for PB cookies, unless I was making them for a gluten-free guest/client. For that reason, I'll give them a 4. Otherwise, a 3-star recipe.

So simple and so delicious! I made these with both sugar and with Splenda (two separate batches). The sugar batch had a nice crisp to it, that you really had to bite into. The Splenda cookies weren't quite crumbly, they held together and looked good, but they pretty much melted on your tongue. Next time I'll try half and half. I also did not 'drop' the cookies, I rolled them into small balls (1"-3/4") and pressed them out with a fork. Each batch made about 4 dozen small cookies.

Great little cookie. I made them with all-natural PB so the flavor was not as strong as a traditional PB cookie. Make sure you do not over-cook these or they will be dry.

These are great for my low carb diet. I used natural unsweetened peanut butter, stevia/sugar blend (only 1/4 cup since it's sweeter) , the egg as directed, ADDED 1/4 cup sugar free chocolate chips along with a tsp of vanilla extract and pinch of salt. DELICIOUS!!

Love these! I changed them a bit which defeats the flourless point but they taste amazing!! I did 1 Cup white sugar 1 Tbsp honey 1 Tbsp vanilla 1 egg 1 Cup chunky unsweetened peanut butter and 1/3 Cup flour (not packed) and some chocolate chips in a few of them...

These cookies are hard and not really cookie consistancy. It was fun to try but the end result was not good and I will not be making them again. I think the cookies might have been less fragile if they were smaller but I made exactly 1 dozen. If I were to make these again I would make them about the size of a quarter. I think I would also add less sugar and some vanilla as others have.

I thought these were a bit too sweet.  They were much better after I added Ghiradelli's 60% cacao (very, very dark chocolate) chips.

Fast,easy and taste great. No flour needed, unless you use Splenda which makes them very delicate but workable  and still yummy when you need a cookie low in carbs. I always add the vanilla. One, one, one and one. Only recipe I know by heart.

I am 13 years old and I made these cookies and they were great! What happened was I didnt have any flour, and I really wanted some cookies. So I went to looking at flourless cookie recipes, and I found these. I couldn't eat them all, so I carried some to an elderly lady across the street. They are obviously the BEST!

These are soooooo goood!!! My husband makes them all the time. Gotta use natural peanut butter (unsalted) and only 3/4 cup sugar. Everyone who tries them asks for the recipe. I really wonder why anyone would make peanut butter cookies any other way. They melt in your mouth and even days later they are still soft (the way a cookie should be).

I give these 5 stars for the simplicity of them.  They work well!  They're a little on the sweet side, but I think that's an acceptable trade-off for the ease of making them.  I don't think I'd waste my time making "regular" peanut butter cookies again!  

I ended up making the last few batches of cookies larger because the process was going slow.  I ended up with 42 cookies.  I'm not sure why it says you should get 12... no way!  Not if you're doing teaspoonfuls.

I ended up adding just a touch of vanilla and baking powder.  I didn't want to take away from the ease of the recipe, but I had them on hand and thought they might add to the flavor and texture.  They were GREAT, but I might try the recipe without those additions to see if they're as good without.

The cookies came out perfectly! Although they are tricky.. you poke at them when they just come out of the oven and the look like they need more time, but LET THEM COOL! They will turn hard and crunchy, its like magic! I added a bit of flour to the remaining batch I had, and they were less dense and softer, but great recipe!

These sounded too good to be true, but they're as good as everyone is saying!  Sooo easy, and so good!  I used Adam's peanut butter and the cookies turned out delicious, but were even better when I sprinkled the tops with a little salt ;).

As is I would say the recipe would be bland. Followed other reviewers suggestions and came up with: 1 c. PB, 1/2 C. white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1 egg 1 tsp vanilla. They were still very sweet, might even cut sugar to 1/2 cup total. Also added 1/2 cup chocolate chips! Delicious!!!

I absolutely LOVE these cookies, I've made 2 batches already in less then 24 hours. I used all natural crunchy PB, 1teas. vanilla flavor, 1/2 splenda and 1/2 brown splenda blend. Baked for 15-17 mins. This is so easy and fast. My kids (adults and teens) try them and asked for more.

These cookies are delicious, and super easy to make, especially if you don't have many ingredients. I was looking for something I could make without having to go to the store, and these were perfect! Mine took a little longer to cook, and even then they were still a tiny bit gooey in the center, but I think that has to do with the peanut butter. Great with crunchy peanut butter, too, and even better if you put a chocolate kiss in the center! Mmm!

There is nothing to interfer with the peanut butter flavor, so select your favorite.  The cookie flavor is all peanut butter and sugar, nothing else.  The viscosity of the peanut butter determines the finished cookie - runny peanut butter is a thin cookie, thick peanut butter is a fat cookie.  The cookies don't rise much, so they can be placed closer together than other cookies (but don't crowd them).  This is our favorite peanut butter cookie recipe.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Yummers! These were the best PB cookies I've ever had, and perfect for my roommate who can't have gluten! I took the advice of other reviewers and substituted 1/4C white sugar plus 1/3C brown sugar for the 1C white sugar, and added 1T vanilla. It worked perfectly! I also doubled the recipe because I wanted to give half to my boyfriend - I'm glad I did because the recipe, as it says, only makes about a dozen cookies. I also threw a couple handfuls of semisweet chocolate chips into half of the batch - amazing! Next time, I'll probably do them all this way. My boyfriend, roommate, and I all loved the cookies - I made them three days ago and they are almost gone. Time for another batch :)

I'm giving this five because I dislike Peanut Butter Cookies and these are pretty good.  It does not get more simple than this. I did adjust my cook time to 14-15 minutes, and I followed the advice of others and let the cookies cool on the baking sheet. These are really wonderful cookies.

I love this recipe, I have been making it for a while now and Ive found that its even better with a tsp of vanilla and rather than a full cup of sugar, do half a cup up white sugar and half a cup of brown. So tasty!

These are not to my liking. Way too much sugar and very heavy. I also tried using natural peanut butter and raw sugar, but they did not firm up.

Absolutely amazing!! Have made it as is, but this time added the vanilla and it seemed to enhance the flavor.  Also made it with organic crunchy peanut butter and placed a Hershey's Kiss on top after removing from the oven and that was superb as well. And lastly, I always halve the sugar (usually use brown sugar) and it's still plenty sweet. 
*Easiest way is to use a full 28-oz jar of pb from Costco, use 1 1/2 c white sugar & 3/4 cup brown, 2 tsp vanilla and 3 eggs.  Baked for 18 mins and voila!

I made these just to compare with the Other flourless PB cookies, I loved these MORE! These were crispy outside and chewy inside. They kept their shape. I used crunchy PB and added chocolate chips to the top. I will make these again. Thank you for a fun,Yummy day Stephanie!!

Probably not the absolute best peanut butter cookies, but the BEST gluten free/ flourless cookies ever. My roommate is gluten free so I was searching for a recipe to make for us both. These were so good. They baked fine and were amazing right out of the oven. They've kept well too and are still yummy after cooling. I made plain and put chocolate chips in some as the teaspoon size made several batches. Both were amazing!

These are great.  I don't think I will ever make pb cookies with flour again.  I took the advise of some other reviews and used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  I also added a tsp of vanilla and 1/2 tsp of baking soda.  If you bake longer than the 8 minutes suggested they are nice and crisp.  I took some to work today for my colleagues and they were very impressed.  This is a keeper!  Thanks for the great recipe.

Well I hate to review things negatively - but my kids did not like them, I did not like them.  They weren't horrible, they just didn't seem like a cookie. If you are watching your weight (atkins type diet) or your wheat or flour intake, this will do the trick for a sweet tooth - but I want the flour.  These could pass for the same thing whether you ate the batter cold or cooked it.  They were way to sweet and I put less sugar in to begin with - I actually threw the remaing batter out as half way through no body liked them.  They also have to cool alot before you move them or they just fall apart - Did I do something wrong - I doubt it, its three ingredients - I used Peter Pan peanut butter , nothing funky - just wanted my thing I guess.

I should not review this because I changed the recipe.  However, they turned out so good I feel I need to. I took others advice...1/2 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar and a tsp of vanilla = perfect peanut butter cookie!

Not bad, but honestly too much sugar for my taste.  Next time- better if I only use 1/2 cup of sugar.  I usually use less sugar in cookie recipes and in this case used little less than 3/4 cup, but it tasted much too sweet for me, and I believe it lost the rich peanut butter flavor.  But tomorrow, after they settle, could be another story.   Simple, quick, no fuss, but charming cookie. I remember being taught to make these as a kid, but with my hands!  Thanks for the mems. and the post.

The key to these is to use "REAL" peanut butter, not the pb that is full of sugar and preservatives.  I see a lot of people saying they are too sweet, I'm sure it's due to the PB they're using.  I used real peanut butter from Trader Joes that's 100% pb and the cookies were not too sweet at all.  I also used 3/4 Splenda and 1/4 sugar as well as egg whites in lieu of whole eggs and added a few choc chips.  Still came out fantastic!

I just wanted a peanut butter cookie recipe and these turned out good.  I doubled the recipe and got 2 1/2 doz cookies, so I'm not sure why the original recipe says you'll only get 6 in a batch.  Also, trust that 8 min. is enough time for the cookies.  I didn't think they were done at that point and cooked them twice as long until they started to brown and firm up, but those turned out pretty crunchy.  The ones that came out at 8 min. turned out much better - firm but not crunchy.

These are wonderful!  Just make sure you use regular PB, not reduced fat, it makes a big difference!  Also, be sure to press these down a bit, they don't flatten at all in the oven!

These cookies are very good as written but really easy to overcook. The peanut butter burns very easily in the oven, especially on the bottom, so be careful to watch them when close to finished. Definitely have a strong peanut-buttery taste.

I used to make PB cookies for my dad all the time.  It was a special treat that I knew would always put a smile on his face. When he was restricted to a gluten free diet, I was so sad that I could no longer make his favorite cookie for him....then, I found this recipe!  I was able to make him PB cookies today for the first time in a few years. He smiled and said, "you're so good to me!"  :)  Thanks for putting a smile on BOTH our faces.  This was such a wonderful find and these cookies are actually better than the PB cookies I used to make him with flour.  We definitely doubled the recipe.

These were only ok.  They came out very squishy and very much like extra sugary-peanut butter.  They'll probably get eaten around here but I doubt I'll make this again.

These are yummy!   I also changed the 1 cup of sugar to 1/4 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar and added one teaspoon of vanilla extract.  I rolled them into balls and made criss cross pattern before putting them into oven.  They looked like real peanut butter cookies.  Thanks for the great recipe!

The easiest cookies I've ever made. And delicious. I prefer using chunky peanut butter.

Turned out great!! So easy and everyone loved them. Followed brown sugar and vanilla tips and added dark chocolate M&M's to a few.  Will try with more mix-ins even though they don't need them!

I din't like these very much. After the third cookie I felt sick. Maybe I'll try again with some moderations (vanilla, brown sugar) because the recipe is so easy.

I have used this exact peanut butter cookie recipe for over 20 years and have used it many times.  They are my son-in-laws favorite. My sons and son-in-law are all Marines and I suspect that atleast 200 dozen of these have gone to Iraq over the years.  They travel well - I save/collect Pringle's cans and use them to ship in.  We call them "Magic Peanut Butter Cookies".

These were very good. I like a little variety so I added a half cup of raisins, used chunky peanut butter and they turned out great! I also doubled the recipe and it gave me 3 dozen average sized cookies. I had to bake them for about 17 minutes per batch since I made them a tad bigger. Perfectly done; will be making them again, very easy.

Thanks a bunch!  Your cookies saved my marriage! Okay, just joking;o) My husband has always disliked peanut butter cookies, but they are my favorites.  I couldn't figure it out because he loves everything else with peanut butter in it.  I had to try this recipe just to see if maybe it could reform him. I had to beg him to try them, but he loved them.  I actually caught him sneaking into the cookie jar later that day to get another one!  I did use 1/2c sugar, 1/4c brown sugar, 1/2 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp vanilla, in addition to the eggs.  I sprinkled the top with cinnamon before baking.  Definitely a keeper.  I'm renaming these cookies "The Marriage Counselor Cookies"

I remember when this recipe first came out in the WIC cookbook in the 1980's. It's the only one the I ever use. We've loved it ever since we first tried it; it's good to see that it's still around and people are still using it.

My kids and i have been making these for years! This is the classic "go to" recipe when you just have to have a cookie.  This is also good if you replace white sugar with brown sugar.

I LOVE that these do not have flour! Very good and you wouldn't know the difference. I doubled the recipe and used 'natural' PB, 1 C brown sugar and 3/4 C Splenda, 2 eggs, 1-2 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp cinnamon. I also added 1 tsp baking soda. Turned out great. Increased baking time to 10 minutes. This is so easy I will use this all the time when my kids want homemade cookies!

I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup of the splenda brown sugar mix and they are still good to satisfy a sweet craving without messing up on a diet. It's hard to believe, once you taste the cookie that there is no flour. Amazing. Great recipe.

Okay, I tried this twice. The first time they were terrible. Very blah taste. Honestly, I would've rather just eaten plain old peanut butter. But I decided to try again and tweak the recipe just a touch. So on my 2nd attempt, I used a dash of vanilla and used brown sugar instead of white sugar. This batch turned out better but still weren't anything worth writting home about. Better flavor but still not worth the calories. On the upside they only took a minute to whip up and made zero mess in the kitchen.

i made this recipe the way it's written and also with some of the suggestions.  i used jif peanut butter.  in my opinion, the recipe is best as written.  the additives of vanilla, baking powder made it runny and too greasy and the cookies spread.  the batch i made with only the 3 listed ingredients were chewy and wonderful.

YUM!!!!  I will have to say I was skeptical about baking peanutbutter mixed with sugar... but these turn out great!  I added the 1/2 tsp baking soda and the 1tsp vanilla as others had suggested.  I don't understand why some are saying they are not done in 8 minutes so they cooked them longer and they burned.  That is because they ARE done in 8 minutes you sillies!!  These are not like a regular cookie - remember they have no flour.  They are still soft after 8 minutes, then CAREFULLY transefer them to a wire rack to cool.  They will harden up as they chill out on the racks for a while.

I am so happy to find this recipe, as my cousin has a wheat allergy and this is something I can make to bring to family dinners and she can eat them!!

I love how simple this recipe is and how much peanut butter flavor the cookies have.  My only complaint is a cup of sugar is too sweet, so I use about 3/4 (half brown, half white).  Sometimes I add a little vanilla extract, but they are still great without it.

These cookies were amazing!  I was skeptical, and thought I would be wasting a cup of peanut butter but they turned out perfect. You must let them cool on the cookie sheet, or they will fall apart. Will definitely make again!

Greasy and runny is what I thought when I got to the dough stage, but with so many high ratings, I decided to trust the recipe, which I followed to the T. Bad idea, as this is the worst peanut butter cookie recipe I have ever followed. The cookies ran and spread and were even more greasy. They ended up thin and spread together. Also they were too sweet. Try another recipe. P.S. I used Skippy smooth peanut butter.

These were OK, quick and easy to make. It's like biting into sugar though, you still feel all the grains. Tasted much better the next day.

I am a little surprised on the rating on this cookie!  I do understand it is a three ingredient, but I'd rather eat a celery stick with natural peanut butter, than this cookie.  

It had a weird sweet and salty taste.  I even added a little more sugar to half the batch due to the weird sweet and salty taste, with no help.  I did add the 1 tsp of vanilla, 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar and I used new jar of Smuckers Natural Peanut Butter without stirring in the oil on top and discarding (one reviewer said that she used natural peanut butter and they were very oily).  The texture of my cookies was fine.  My husband thought at first that I added too much salt to the recipe and thought they were “ok” but nothing special.

I would try another recipe or eat a spoonful of peanut butter instead.

These should be called "Stick to the roof of your mouth PB cookies" My husband LOVED them!!  I replaced the sugar with 1/2 C. splenda blend for baking and added a few chopped peanuts for texture.  I used a 1" cookie scoop and the recipe made 16 cookies.  This one is a keeper!

Made this recipe with store-brand natural peanut butter (the kind that separates).  Mixed the peanut butter well before measuring.  Results were very disappointing...grease (peanut oil) oozed from the cookies while baking and ran all over the pan. Results were very odd, not like a cookie...not quite a candy.   May try again with regular peanut butter, like Jif or Skippy.

It was incredibly easy to make these cookies! My only advice to others is 1) Definitely keep an eye on the clock or timer, because they brown pretty quickly and 2) After the cookies are out of the oven, let them cool for a few minutes to harden completely, before you devour them!

I dont know how this got so many raving reviews. To me - it was just sugar and peanut butter. Really sweet and 8 minutes did not suffice in baking time. Had to bake it an extra 5 minutes.

***WARNING***HIGHLY**ADDICTIVE***YUM***
I tweaked the recipe a bit as the others have suggested.  I doubled the batch (we are having company) and I used 2 eggs, 1 cup white sugar, 1 cup brown sugar, 1/2 tsp. vanilla and 2 cups of peanut butter.  I mixed the recipe until it became thick and baked in a 350 degree oven on the top rack for 8 minutes.  I let cool on the pan for about 2 minutes, then transferred to wire rack to finish cooling.  I ate three during transfer and am doing my best not to go grab some more!

These are unbelievably addicting. First time I made them, I made a second batch right away because I knew they'd go quickly. I used a store brand plain chunky peanut butter and they were just right! My only recommendation is to keep a lot of milk nearby. Peanut butter cookies and milk are the perfect combo.

These are the cookies for peanut butter lovers who like to eat peanut butter straight out of the jar (i.e. me!).  I used standard creamy peanut butter and decided to use brown sugar in place of the white sugar, and also added 1/4 teaspoon vanilla.  I admit I was a little scared when I mixed the ingredients together, because the batter seemed to have a crumbly, oily consistency.  It also seemed a little grainy, like someone else mentioned.  But that just means it needs a little more mixing.  I kneaded mine like dough and that did the trick.  I baked mine on the top rack for only 8 minutes.  Any longer than that, and they wouldn't have been chewy and would have dried out and become really crumbly.  Actually, my boyfriend still thought they were a bit crumbly, but we both still like them enough to make them again.  Thanks for an easy recipe!

Yummy! I doubled the recipe, used half white and half brown sugar, and added 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla. I made these for someone else since I don't like peanut butter, but I still ended up eating at least five of them. Great recipe.

Hard, colour is not even (bottoms burn), turn out overly sweet. Nor very good in other words. I much prefer peanut butter cookies with flour and some butter on the side.

In the oven now....AWESOME!  Surprised, bewildered and Amazed! Just put the last batch in the oven.  I doubled the recipe and did the following: 2 cups Jif Extra Crunchy PB, 1 cup Sugar, 1 cup Brown Sugar, 2 Eggs and a "dollop" of vanilla....Wow!  These are very chewy and peanut buttery--truly never thought this would actually turn out!  You can make a ton with no effort!  Thanks Stephanie!

You'll get good cookies with the recipe, but I found that with a couple of small additons, they turn out even more wonderful!  I added a small pinch of baking soda, a little salt, and a splash of vanilla.  Without the additons, I thought the cookies tasted a little off.  They really spread out with the baking soda, so watch out!  I baked them for about 12 minutes simply because I forgot about them, and I thought they came out better than when they were in for only 8 minutes.

Oh yum.  I used low-carb peanut butter (it was all we had) and decreased the sugar by about 1/4 cup.  I also added 2 tablespoons of cocoa powder.  Holy cow, heaven in a cookie!  I will say that these, unlike most cookies, are not at their best while still warm.  They definitely need to cool completely, otherwise you wonder if you cooked them long enough.  But yeah, fantastic recipe, defintely one I'll keep around!  Thanks!

Great recipe ! After reading all the great reviews I made a batch. Except I changed a couple of things. I added 2 tablespoons of Nutella for the chocolate flavor and 1 1/5 teaspoons of vanilla and a touch of cinnamon. WOW !!!! Taste like peanut butter cups in cookie form .. Thanks I needed this :)

WAHOO! This is just what I was craving; I had to run upstairs and write a review before the second batch even finishes cooking! I got some yummy cookies without even having to run to the grocery store! If you love peanut butter, this is something you should try. I used the original recipe and I'm very happy with it!

These were excellent!!!  I have been suffering a sweet tooth lately (one week of every month!!), and these cookies really helped cure that!!  Per other's advice, I highly recommend both cooking ONLY 8 minutes and definately letting the cookies sit for AT LEAST 5 minutes before taking them off the sheet.  Chunky peanut butter really works great  for this recipe as well...Yummy!  :)

Wow Stephanie! Who would have thought that such great cookies could be made with no flour, baking soda, etc.? My husband,a peanut butter cookie aficionado,says this will be our ONLY peanut butter cookie recipe from now on. I, who can take them or leave them, agree. This recipe results in cookies exactly like the kind with flour, only they are lighter, crisper and obviously, much healthier. These cookies, in the words of my niece, ROCK! Thanks!

SO GOOD ! One change though, I only used 1/2 a cup of sugar not 1 whole cup. Be sure your baking sheet is well greased so these moist treats do nto crumble when removing them, at least 5 mins after cooking on the cookie sheet.

Never thought it was possible! I did add some flour as I was afraid that it was not heavy enough to stay together. Almost like a peanut brittle if you over cook them. I will lessen the cooking time so that they are softer and not so hard. Way easier than a regular cookie for sure!!

This cookie is very tasty!!  With the help from the other reviews, I too added 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar, 3-4 TBL flour and vanilla.  The result was a tasty, rich, quick and easy cookie that is quite yummy.  Soft and chewy texture...not crumbly at all.

After reading reviews I used 1/2 cup brown sugar, and a little less than 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 tsp vanilla, and 2-4 TBSP Flour making the nicest, FASTEST peanut butter cookies ever.  It made about 24 cookies (a little less) and they did need to be flattened before baking (no gluten means they don't spread on their own) - GREAT RECIPE, VERY EASY FOR KIDS!

These cookies are absolutly horrible.  The baking time was too short, and when 
left them in longer, they spread out and turned into a tough, hard, chewy thing.
They are nearly impossible to get off the pan and I will never try this recipe again!
Anyone who wants to have a cookie that tastes like a peanut butter cookie, should
not try this recipe.  Maybe one with flour would work.

These cookies are great, so easy to prepare. The only thing wrong with the instructions is that they should be flattened with a fork like most other peanut butter cookie recipes and they need to be cooked longer. 8 minutes is not enough. I baked them from 13-15 minutes and my oven temp. is precise. I have made these cookies numerous times.

This is identical to the recipe on the Kraft peanut butter jar except the Kraft recipe only calls for 1/2 cup sugar, an improvement that gives the cookies the perfect amount of sweetness. Because there's no flour you don't get the texture of a traditional cookie (this cookie is a bit crumbly) but compared to similar recipes it's a GREAT low-carb or gluten free option - and it's super easy! As others have suggested, adding vanilla is a nice touch. And they may look like they're underdone - if they look like they need another couple minutes that's normal, take them out and once they cool they'll harden enough to be the perfect consistency.

They are great.  I double the recipe and reduce the sugar to 1 1/2 cups for a double recipe.  I also increase the baking time by 3-4 minutes to make them crisp. Pictured are my two helpers.  They love licking the empty peanut butter jar.

This is a great recipe!!! Super simple and the cookies taste amazing... I followed the recipe exactly just dressed the cookies up a bit for presentation. I made 24 small cookies, put a tiny chocolate hearts in the center of each one, and sprinkled them with powdered sugar. It's a keeper... Thank you for sharing!

These were a big hit, but I am giving it 4 stars since I followed some other reviewers' feedback and used 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar, 1 tsp. vanilla and some salt.  A great gluten-free recipe!

Wonderful! Easy and simple! I suggest to add a pinch of salt after baking the cookies. It brings out the peanut butter taste.

Seriously people, stop saying they need flour. Have a little respect for people with celiac disease. Talk about a wet sugar ball. If you want a good tasting cookie don't take they easy road, make a  cookie with more than 3 ingredients! Unless you are like me with a legit reason to make them, as I am gluten intalerent

These are delicious.  I took them to a meeting, and others raved and asked for the recipe.  As other reviewers suggested, I added 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1 tsp vanilla.  They are very sweet, and I don't believe they need the extra sugar on top.   I used natural peanut butter, and half brown sugar, and half turbinado (raw cane sugar) in stead of white sugar.  They were crisp, and chewy, just the way we like them.  They are my new favorite peanut butter cookie recipe!

Great recipe for a quick peanut butter fix. The recipe was easy to follow. Next time I will use chunky peanut butter for more texture. Good recipe.

I've been making this recipe for years! I add a tsp of vanilla extract to add a lil more flavor to the cookie. I sometimes also add a cup of chocolate chips. If you want a crunch use chunky peanut butter. This is a fun recipe cause you can play with it.

These disappear in a heartbeat each and every time and I always make 2 or 3 batches.  This is so easy that the batter is ready before the oven has a chance to heat up.  The only thing I do differently is use Splenda Brown Sugar.  They are fabulous!

I just made these cookies and they came out great but they did come out a little too soft so i baked them just a little longer. I also used the suggestion of 1/2 cup white sugar and1/2 cup of brown sugar and vanilla thanks for the recipe!

I made some for a Christmas get together at school and my friends and I all loved it. I made mini ones that turned out so cute! On some, I put white chocolate chips which added a nice flavor. Make sure you use decent quality peanut butter with a good consistency, none of the dry bottom of the jar junk . Good luck, I would recommend this recipe

These were awesome! I used brown sugar instead of white (I was out) and a little vanilla. Omg! My son devoured these. My husband even ate one and he hates peanut butter lol. Definitely a keeper.

The original recipe is very good, I like to make recipes as written first and then make changes to my preference. 
I now make these all the time, and since it's just me, I make half a batch- 1/2 c. Sugar and 1/2 c. Peanut Butter but keep it at 1 whole egg. I also add some vanilla and chocolate chips. I find that the extra egg makes it more gooey (I like it that way.) Some good tips on this are, cook it until the bottoms are done (about 7 minutes in my oven) and yes, the rest is gonna seem undone but you take it out and let them cool. Once cool they thicken/ harden up a bit. The inside will still be a bit gooey though so if that's not what your looking for, try a recipe with flour. Also, as far as aesthetics go, they're only gonna be as pretty as you make them on the pan before baking. 
Hope I help someone, happy baking!

I make these with Adam's Natural Peanut butter and add vanilla. They are a little crumbly before baking and a bit fragile. But sooo tasty. I love the crisp outside and the chewy peanut butterness. We sometimes add a few chocolate chips pressed in on top when the cookies come out for a chocolate center.

I am going to go with 4 stars, but something tells me closer to 3.5 stars the way it is written. There is way too much sugar in these. 1/2 C suffices. Also, there is no way this makes 6 cookies. I got about 14 good size cookies out of this recipe! Lastly, bake time is seriously off. Mine took about 14 minutes! Last complaint is that as written these crumble so badly they were a mess. However, the best part of these is that they were delicious! Taste just as good as a tradional recipe, maybe even better! Family loved them and they were very quick and easy! Will make again but with 1/2 C of sugar, extended bake time, and 1/2 tsp vanilla.

Perfect as-is. Can substitute almond butter for peanut butter. Use small or medium cookie scoop to form, then flatten and crisscross with fork. To avoid crumbling, give baked cookies a few minutes to rest on tray before moving to cooling rack.

These were very simple.  I've always wanted to try these, especially since I have friends that need to eat gluten-free.  They turned out great, except I had to bake mine A LOT longer than 8 minutes...more like three times that much at about 21 or 22 minutes.  That's why I gave this only 4 stars.

These were really good. Added 1 tsp. of vanilla and doubled the recipe. Got 26 medium-larger size cookies out of the doubled recipe.  Ended up cooking them for way longer than it says--about 20 minutes in all.  They never looked done. Came out great though--slightly crunchy on the outside, and chewy on the inside. They were a little more sugary than a real made-with-flour cookie and more sweet than rich, but I would still definitely make again if we get a craving and don't feel like making the "real thing".

Love these, so simple and yummy.   I added 1teaspoon vanilla, 2 tablespoons flaxseed, 2 tablespoons whole wheat flour, and 2 tablespoons butter. Baked a litte longer maybe 10 - 12 minutes in a very well preheated oven.  Let them cool and they will hold together perfectly. Made 8 large cookies.

These are good but very heavy and rich as other reviewers have said.  For that reason, I probably wouldn't make them again.  They were a little too much for me.

They work! Part of my brain is surprised, but it's true. They are super rich and dense - so lots of tea or milk. I'd also recommend making them small and bite sized (if you are like me and always makes HUGE cookies), so they aren't as overwhelming, and also they fall apart easier due to lack of flour.

These are rich but do not taste the way usual peanut butter cookies taste. I found that mine even after adding some vanilla extract was quite crumbly. After the cookies finished they tasted a little too rich and they were still too crumbly. This was a good idea but needs some tweaking.

These are amazing! My husband has a gluten allergy so he can't eat regular cookies. These don't taste anything like normal "gluten-free" deserts (which usually suck). This tastes almost exactly like a  "real" PB cookie... better even. And they are so easy to make! They were so good, I'm even planning on making them for a Bridal Shower I'm throwing in a couple of weeks. These will definitely be a multi-repeat recipe in our house!

This was so easy and my client LOVED these!  And it didn't take a lot of ingredients she didn't have.  Heck, I had a taste (because it didn't have anything in it I'm allergic to) and made me want to make some for myself.  and its so easy it can be doubled, tripled or any other multiples very easy!

This is the best peanut butter cookie recipe!  I made them exactly as the recipe directs.  They were incredible, and didn't last long. My daughter requested a second batch.  The second time, I added chocolate chips to the mixture.  Although I didn't think they could get any better, I think they did!  Peanut butter and chocolate...incredible!

Thank you for sharing this simple and quick recipe.  I had a neighbor who was coming for a bbq and I needed a glutin free dessert for her son.  I had all the ingredients and whipped them out in no time.  I wasn't sure about the taste so I tried it on our 5 children. They all loved them,  I'm going to need to double the recipe.  I did top them with mini m&m as well.  Again thank you, its a new favorate for my neighbor and our family as well.

Yummy! These came out exactly as the description said- heavy and VERY peanut butter-y! I had a craving for something sweet and had no snacks in the house- these were so easy and quick to make! Just a couple suggestions: 1) I would definitely flatten these with a fork, or they won't bake right. 2) They were VERY sweet, probably since the peanut butter is already sweetened. I have a huge sweet tooth so I didn't mind, but if you don't want them too sweet you could probably cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup and they would still be really tasty. Thanks for a great recipe! 
ETA: I wonder if the brand of peanut butter is what's causing some people to have trouble? If anyone's curious, I used Peter Pan Whipped and Creamy peanut butter. I usually buy Jif but the Peter Pan was on sale. I will try it with Jif next time and see what happens!

I thought these were the best thing ever until I ran out of peanut butter.  I ended up having to use about 2-3 tbs of almond butter to make up the deficit and then threw in a handful of peanut butter chips as well.  An amazing soft peanut-almond butter cookie.  The guys and I ate the entire tray in 1 night.

My husband loves peanut butter, so I always find myself adding extra peanut butter to cookie recipes, and it's still not enough.  Finally, a recipe that is peanut buttery enough on its own! I love it, and it is so simple and makes wonderful cookies.  It helps to chill them for a few before working them into cookie balls.  I would also not recommend flattening them too much as you will get very flat cookies.

This is my favorite peanut butter cookie recipe! I love it how quick and easy these are. I wasn't sure whether they were really going to turn into cookies, since the recipe doesn't use any flour, but they turned out so good! The best thing is that they are gluten free, so I could just make them as is without using gluten free flour. However, I did make some changes according to the recommendations. I used 1 teasp. vanilla extract and as much light brown sugar (about 1/4 cup) as I had left to add up to a total of 1 cup with the the white sugar. I also didn't have any eggs, so I used a flaxseed egg substitute, as listed on many vegan websites (1 Tbsp. ground flaxseed + 3 Tbsp. water). The texture was still perfect.

Good. I subbed in 1/4 cup of brown sugar and 1/4 cup of white sugar because I used honey flavored peanut butter. I also added vanilla and chocolate chips. They tasted a little smoked/toasted when I first got them out but as they cooled it pretty much went away..idk good concept and a good cookie but I have another recipe that I like better. Thanks though!

Great low carb cookie when using Ideal sugar.  My husband make these when we want a sweet treat without all the calories.  Make sure you add a little more butter because it comes out a little dry when baking with Ideal otherwise you would never have guessed it was low carb.

I always love these! Delicious and easy. I do add a splash of vanilla like many other reviewers. I usually use mostly brown sugar, I just like it better than white. I also have used part raw sugar, and they tasted great! Also, usually use egg whites only, just a personal preference.

Quite possibly the best peanut butter cookie ever!  Very peanut buttery and delicious.  I did use a some other reviewers' suggestion and added 1 tsp of vanilla extract.  They are extra delicious right out of the oven too - they just fall apart, but who cares!!! If you don't want them to fall apart when you eat them, be sure to cool for about 5-10 minutes.

Love these!!! I needed something gluten and dairy free. These fit the bill perfect. 

I used Maranatha no stir crunchy peanut butter. I used 1/2 c brown sugar and 1/2 c white sugar. I also used 1/4 c egg white substitute and 1 tsp olive oil in place of the egg. I baked them for 10 minutes till they were just getting browned. When they first come out they seem almost liquid, but after just setting on the sheet for 10-15 min they were just like regular cookies. I ate six of them! These are great!

This is a GREAT cookie recipe! You can add 1 tsp of vanilla if desired but this recipe is AWESOME just as it is. It doesnt NEED tinkering with to make it good, it just is. I've been making it for years -we call it hte 1-1-1 recipe lol.

Good recipe! My friends and I get together every week for dinner, and every week I bring dessert. We cater to many different dietary requests and lately our good friends, who are gluten-free (she has celiac disease and he is a compassionate boyfriend) have been coming to dinner. This is my first gluten-free dessert I picked specially for them.

I only had super-crunchy Skippy peanut butter, which did not effect the recipe, the crunch was a nice touch.

I took other's comments into consideration and added 1 teaspoon of vanilla. In my opinion 1/2 teaspoon would have been sufficient.

I did flatten the cookies (typical peanut-butter cookie style) with a fork before baking. They did spread a little bit but baked beautifully.

People commented that this recipe made a small batch but I thought the yield was fair.

I was nervous for my friends to try my first attempt at gluten-free baking (I even brought back-up cookies I knew I could count on!). They loved them though. I got rave reviews and my gluten-free friends couldn't believe there was no flour substitute used. I went home with an empty plate!

I am very happy with this recipe and will absolutely be making these again!

Made mine with a few adjustments based on past reviews; doubled the batch, used 1 cup of brown sugar, 1/2 a cup of white sugar, 1/2 a cup of flour and a bag semi-sweet chocolate chunks. Tasted like a deconstructed Reese's Cup. Co-workers loved them and they really hit the spot during that 3pm slump.

Excellent! I made these for a family who has Celiac's disease. I doubled the recipe--used a whole jar of peanut butter, 2 cups sugar, and 2 eggs. I also added a splash of vanilla. Super delicious, and probably the easiest cookies I have ever made.

I had a sweet craving tonight and wanting something quick, easy, and not too bad for me.  This did the trick!  I also subbed splenda for sugar as others did.  I used crunch peanut butter which made them a bit crumbly but still okay.  This is a great recipe to have on hand when you need a cookie in a pinch.  I also liked the small yield since it is just me and the hubby.- The above was my original review but today (1 day later) I think the cookies have an odd aftertaste, but I'm going to attribute that to the splenda.

Didn't love these... much too heavy and didn't set up nicely after the recommended 8 minutes cook time (actually didn't really set up much better even baking for 12 minutes). I'll stick to recipes with flour for my peanut butter cookies.

These were delicious and just as good if not better as regular PB cookies.  I made them for my sister since she cant have anything with gluten in them.  She loved them too.   One thing you do have to do is flatten them some with a fork before baking.  I did double the recipe and there was more then enough cookies.  I did use a cookie scooper so maybe thats why I had more.

Easy since there are few ingredients, but be careful about the time spent on the cookie tray, both while baking and while cooling. My only complaint is that some didn't seem cooked all the way. There is also a gritty sugar consistency about them. I might find another PB cookie recipe to try in future.

delicious!  you're right about it being a small recipe though.  next time i would double or maybe triple it.  LET THEM COOL BEFORE REMOVING FROM PAN.  like, cool completely.  the melted sugar solidifies when they cool and makes them cookie rather than goopy.  i also reduced to 3/4 cup sugar, and i used crunchy peanut butter.

Just made these last night. PERFECTION! I had to force myself to stop eating them! I added a tsp of vanilla, a tsp of baking soda and used half white and half brown sugar! I made mine bigger and probably had to cook them a total of 12 min, but the were still slightly underdone and chewy in the center!! Just how I like them. I did the fork thing on the first few...the second batch I added chocolate chips and didn't press them down at all when they came out of the oven. So good. I may make some more tonight!!! AND EASY!!

Really good peanut butter cookies with simple ingredients. Very rich too, almost need a whole glass of milk. The only thing I would suggest is to add a little flour because they crumble apart and cook for longer than 8 minutes. Mine were still doughy in the middle. Other than that, wonderful cookies!

These were great! Based on the reviews, I used 3/4 cup sugar (next time I'll reduce that to 1/2 cup sugar, half brown and half white), and added 1 tsp. vanilla and 1/2 tsp. baking soda. They were gone in a day!

I'm so pleased with these. They taste great, and they don't have flour! Win-win, because I can't have flour. I'm not supposed to have much sugar, either, but I made these for company and I just replaced half the sugar with Splenda. Seems to have worked just fine.  I also used cookie cutters on them because I had festive seasonal cookie cutters I wanted to use and I hate sugar cookies. While the cutting process was a little bit messier and slower than with sugar cookies, it actually worked really well. I'm really very happy with these cookies!

These cookies are super easy, but very sweet, I would suggest maybe cutting the sugar in half unless you're using unsweetened peanut butter.  Otherwise they are super yummy!

Good for the simplicity of ingredients, but definitely not the first PB cookie recipe I would go to. They're very sweet, dense, crumbly, and a bit gritty.

good basic recipe.  for perfection, use natural peanut butter - it actually tastes like peanuts unlike the sugar laden popular brands.   like others, i did 50/50 white/brown sugar, added some vanilla, and also a little salt to bring out the flavors.  yum! update:  after making four varying recipes of this today, i've noticed that texture is key.  the first batch (as the recipe states) was just crumbs that had to be compressed to make a cookie.  adding the vanilla really helps make it more like a "batter" and they look more like cookies.

Excellent taste and a good option for gluten-free diets. No one would know there's no flour if you didn't mention it.

These were a huge disappointment.  I followed the recipe exactly - I mean there are only 3 ingredients, right?  The baking time was way off.  Instead of 8 minutes I had to bake them for 15 (and yes, I have an oven thermometer and the temperature was correct.)  Then they stuck to the cookie sheet so not one came off looking attractive.  They are too sweet for my taste and they fall apart once they are cool.  I was willing to assume operator error until I sorted the reviews and saw there are over 5 pages of similar reviews.  I am really sorry, I have never rated anything so low before.

First off, how does anyone only get 6 cookies out of this batch, or even just 12? Are they making them for giants? I made the cookies as written and got 24 regular sized cookies out of one batch. I wanted something sweet, but didn't have anything in the house to put together, until I seen this recipe. I baked them for 8 minutes. I never bake cookies according to the package when I buy them in the store, they are always over cooked that way. I figured if people on here thought 8 minutes was too short, then it probably was right on the money..As cookies cool, they get hard, so if people had hard and crumbly cookies, they cooked them too long. Let your cookies come out of the oven a little soft, and you will have a perfect cookie. These were awesome.

These were good.  I added 1 TSP vanilla and some mini chocolate chips to half the batch.  The chocolate was a really tasty addition, made it taste like a peanut butter cup.

I used low fat peanut butter and sugar called half sugar, and used 5 egg whites and they turned out so yummy!!  I love the way the feel like a cookie in your mouth then when you swallow it, it feels like you just ate a spoonful of peanut butter and is nice and smooth in your throat.  So good!!  My diet isn't going to go down the tubes with this cookie, well besides the fact that I can't stop eating them.  Had to give some away!!

THESE ARE SO GOOD!!!  I made mine with 3/4 c white sugar, 1/4 c light brown sugar + a splash of vanilla.  Scooped with a tablespoon, flattened with a fork for the tradition pb cookie look, and baked for 10 minutes.  SOOOOO peanut buttery!!!!  Sweet, salty, and with the perfect consistency.  And now I have a delicious cookie that just happens to be gluten free!

I have been making these for about 20 years - they are the best PB cookie I have ever made or eaten.  My tip is to let the batter sit for about 5 minutes before scooping.  I use a small ice cream scoop and flatten with a glass bottome dipped in sugar.  You may also substitute brown sugar or Splenda for the 1 cup of sugar.  yummo - glad someone put this recipe on this site.

I didn't have any flour and I wanted to make a cookie using jam. (I work at Stonewall Kitchen yumm!) I decided to adapt this recipe and make a PB&J cookie. I doubled the eggs, and peanut butter, I then added 1 and 2/3 cups of sugar (almost doubled.) Put them on parchment in tsp amounts poked a hole and added 1/2 tsp of jam. Woo they sure spread out and the jam went everywhere. The second batch I used 1/2 tsp of batter and a tiny dab of jam- kept the same amount of time since I thought it wasn't long enough to begin with. Mmm delicious!! Highly recommended!

hubby wanted peanut butter cookies late in the evening. I stumbled upon this recipe and it was so easy I couldn't say no. Though for sure they would not come out but they did and they were awesome! Super Easy, Way Yummy! I did use part brown and part white sugar and natural pb. I needed to bake them longer than 8 min. Also, I think the nutritional facts are off, but it also depends how big you make them and what ingrediants you use. Our cookies only totaled 140ish calories. Just an FYI!

I was craving something sweet last night, but didn't have many of the usual baking ingredients on hand, so I came on here found this recipe. I decided to give it a try and I was NOT disappointed! I used Splenda for the sugar and egg substitute so the only real calories were from the peanut butter. I also added 1 tsp. of vanilla like others suggested. They turned out so rich and delicious! I would have never guessed that they had no flour, I can't believe it! Thanks so much for the recipe! I will definitely be making these again and again!

This was my first time both making and tasting peanut butter coookies and I am in love! Delicious. I can not believe I never made them before, being a huge peanut butter fan. The only changes I made was to slightly reduce the sugar (to about 2/3 cup) as I prefer less sweet cookies and to add a pinch of vanilla and about 2 tbsp flour (I am a carb girl, cant help it!). Thank you so much for the great recipe - took less than 10 min to get into the oven - perfect for a cookie craving! :)

I've also made these for years but came to this site to see how people may have tweaked the recipe. Forewarned these are not like traditional p.b. cookies, so texture and taste will be slightly different. I followed changes for adding a mix of brown and white sugars and the baking soda. I also have always put in the vanilla and I did throw in a few handfuls of Heath English toffee bits! I rolled dough into small balls and flattened with a fork to bake. I found they were done at 6 minutes making small cookies. And I did use crunchy organic peanut butter. They were fine. Good, quick recipe for p.b. lovers.

Definitely a good recipe. The cookies turned out very flavorful! I've tried it twice, and this time I added 1 teaspoon baking soda. I was able to get 12 large cookies out of this recipe, and I didn't double anything.  Anywayz, thanks for sharing!

They taste excellent, but the texture and the fact that they fall apart so easily is the only thing that I disliked. Other than that a good cookie, kind of like a pb fudge almost. And YES... You will need milk with these!!

I would not recommend this recipe for peanut butter cookies if you have a serious peanut butter fan in your house. They were too gooey (I followed directions exactly) and took forever to cool enough to remove from the pan. I had to wait 10 minutes for them to be rack-able. Hubby said they tasted like the inside of a peanut butter cup instead of a cookie.

I love these cookies....I changed the recipe a little bit too...I first, doubled the batch, then added 1 teaspoon of vanilla and added 1/8 cup of flour and they turned out great!!! Very soft and not gooey at all.  I baked for 8 minutes and let stand on cookie sheet for 2 minutes before removing. (so they didn't break apart)  With these few changes, these are wonderful cookies.  Next time I will add another half of cup of sugar to the double batch! Thanks for a great recipe....so simple.

This is good, but the actual Kraft recipe only calls for 1/2 c. sugar to every cup of peanut butter. I would go with the less sugar option.

If you love chocolate, you can make these even yummier by baking the 8 minutes, then putting a piece of chocolate bar on each cookie; and baking 1 minute more.  Absolutely fabulous!

I love these cookies. I can whip up a batch in 20 min whenever a sweet tooth attack strikes.  No need to get out all the equipment, just a bowl, a wooden spoon, and a baking sheet!  Everyone I have made them for thinks that they are the best cookie ever.  The trick to a less fragile cookie is to roll the dough into 18 balls and flatten with a fork then bake them at 325 degrees for 14 min and leave them on the cookie sheet until they harden up enough to remove with your hands.  5-7 min or so.

So delicious and easy!  I followed the advise of others and used 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar and they came out perfect!  As others have mentioned, make sure you eat these with a glass of milk!

These were fabulous straight out of the oven. I adjusted the recipe a bit by adding vanilla, brown sugar, and just a little gluten-free flour to stretch them a bit. Yum.

Very easy and pretty good.  I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup light brown sugar (because that's what I had) and added 1/2 tsp. vanilla.  Recipe made 18.  I rolled the first 12 into a ball and flattened with a glass dipped in sugar.  I rolled the second batch into a ball and made a criss-cross on them with a fork.  Baked for 19 minutes and cooled on baking sheet.  Prefer 1st batch.

These were wonderful. Per other reviews I did add 1/2 tsp of Vanilla and they were great. My husband said they were the best he's ever had. Out of this recipes I got a dozen cookies so if you want more you will need to double or triple the recipe.

Wow! They are good and it does not get any easier than this; they even cook quickly!! I was looking to make Christmas cookies for a few gluten-free people and these are a winner! Much easier than fussing with multiple (expensive) flours.

very crumbly, not all that tasty.  However, I used organic, unsweetened peanut butter and course organic cane sugar.  This recipe would probably work better with a peanut butter such as kraft brand or something, and a softer sugar.

I have been making these cookies for years and i double the recipe add a teaspoon of baking soda, a teaspoon or so of vanilla and about an 8th of a teaspoon of cinnamon. People beg me for this recipe and are so amazed at how easy it is. Great starter recipe for kids that want to bake because it's fool proof:)

This was OK. They were so fragile and even after cooling they would fall apart in my hands. I like the firmness/crunch that I'm used to with peanut butter cookies, this just didnt hit the mark. After my test batch, I started to try everything i could to save the rest of the dough, I tried adding choc chips, adding flour, it just always felt like it was missing something.

This is the BEST PB cookies recipe I have ever made/ate.  Usually when I make PB cookies they are extremely dry, not so with these.  These cookies were so moist and chewy.  I doubled the recipe and added a splash of vanilla.  I also added a 1/2 cup of flour.  I was afraid that the cookies w/o the flour might now bake properly.  But, I tell you what, adding that flour helped the texture.  W/O the flour (or so much in my case) made the cookies light which I believe is hard to do.  I also made my cookies into PB Kisses, with a Hersey Kiss in the middle.  This is my go to recipe for PB cookies, will be using again and again and again....

These were very good. I had to press them out with a fork to get them done inside, I also cooked them for 10 minutes instead of 8. Very peanut buttery. Next time I will try them with the modifications suggested.

This is THE peanut butter cookie recipe!  If I'm looking to lighten them up I add 1 tsp. baking soda.  Also, you can use 1/3 c. plain yogurt and 1 tsp. baking powder as a substitute for the egg.  These never last 24 hours in my house!!

I got this same recipe from a little lady about to celebrate her 107th birthday.  Was a little sceptable of a flourless cookie, so I made them, except I use light brown sugar insted of white sugar and I add 1/2 cup peanut butter chips.  I only bake them for about 8-10 minutes, we like them soft baked.  They are the best cookies ever!!  My kids eat them off of the pan before they cool.  They taste just like those cookies you get at the mall for $2 EACH.  I actually think they are better!  The easiest and absolutly the best peanut butter cookies you will ever eat.

I'm cutting refined flour and sugar from my diet so I made these a little differently.  I used natural peanut butter, egg, 3/4 cup raw honey and a dash of vanilla.  In half the batch I sprinkled a bit of baking soda.  The cookies without soda are denser, while the ones with soda look a little more "cratered" and have more air in them, as you might expect.  Both taste really good, especially since I haven't had traditional cookies in a while.  Next time I will add a pinch of salt, just to offset the sweetness a bit.  To me, they taste similar to peanut butter and honey toast.  Yummmmm!

These cookies are awesome! I did not double the batch but just added a few things...1/2 teaspoon of baking powder, 1 extra egg, 1 teaspoon of vanila,  1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and a dash of salt. I also did 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar. I baked them for 12 minutes, and when they were about half way done a did the criss-cross thing with a sugar coated fork on top of the cookies. they came out very moist, not to heavy and very yummy! One batch made about 21 good size cookies! I will definitly make again!

I followed the recipe, except that I added an extra egg, vanilla and only 1/3 cup of flour..(I know it sort of defeats the purpose, but I did it because of the reviews that said the cookies fell apart) and this cookie was the perfect texture! Soft and chewy and NOT AT ALL Sticky or too heavy!!

My husband was dying for cookies but I didn't want to make a lot and wanted to make them quickly so this seemed like the way to go. My cookies looked nothing like the picture. They came out so flat and wide they looked like pancakes, which made it difficult to remove them from the pan. They were super oily and just overall not so great. Maybe I just didn't cook them long enough? Not going to try this recipe again to find out. Will stick with the recipe with flour in it.

The 3 ingredients and no flour intrigued me. Mixed with handheld mixer, made these to the recipe, used small cookie scoop to put them on the cookie sheet. I also tried it with teaspoon. Both cooked exactly to the shape they were when I put them on the pan. I did flatten some and made the crisscross with a sugared fork, they didn't spread either. Mixed up very well, no crystals of sugar in the dough. And yes, they are really sweet, like you mixed sugar with PB. I would much rather have a regular flour type PB cookie, but it was fun to try something different.

WOW!!  These cookies are fantastic!!  I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar, and added 1 teaspoon of vanilla as some other reviewers suggested.  I baked these on a very shiny aluminum cookie sheet, so I ended up leaving them in the oven for a full 10 minutes; the cookies came out with a subtle crunchiness on the outside, and a great chewy middle.  I made these cookies the size of any other regular drop cookie and had no issues with them being under- or over-baked.  Thanks for this great recipe, Stephanie!  This is another dairy-free recipe that my grandson and I can enjoy making together.  (In fact, right after the first batch was done baking, he requested a second batch...these cookies are THAT good...I was happy to oblige.)

I made mine with Raw Almond Butter instead of Peanut Butter and they were delish!  I did add the Baking Soda and Vanilla as suggested below.  I also cut the Sugar to 1/4 cup because I wanted the almond taste, not the sweet cookie taste.  Excellent!

These cookies were excellent! I can't believe how easy they were to make!!!! As per other reviewers' recommendations, I used 1/2 tspn. baking soda, 3/4 cup sugars (1/4 white, 1/2 brown), a whole tspn. of vanilla, one egg, and crunchy peanut butter.  Eight mins. was definitely not enough baking time--I baked them for about 12-15 mins., but kept a close eye on them those last few minutes.  Will DEFINITELY makes these again, and I can't wait to share them with others!

Yum!  I made this recipe years ago when I saw it on the back of my box of sugar.  One thing I figured out that time was not to use sweetened peanut butter (like Jif, Skippy etc.) and use a plain salted one (I chose Adams, which is my favorite).  I did use half white sugar and half brown sugar and added a tiny bit of vanilla and baking soda as some others suggested.  Don't try to just pick these up off a hot cookie sheet because they will just fall apart!  I also cooked mine quite a bit longer than 8 minutes, probably closer to 12 or 15, but I don't think you can really burn them...?

These cookies can be tricky and if you get it right they are soo moist and chewy and delicious! I made them the way it says to make them and came out great, also I used jiff peanut butter. The second time I tried like people said, vanilla and less sugar, chocolate chips. It was a horrible cookie, i also used skippy this time and it did taste the same. I say make them the way they say and use Jiff!!

This is the most awesome recipe. I learned about it over a year ago and have been making them since. Don't even need to remember anything!  Just three ingredients. However, I usually add a pinch of salt and some vanilla.  Thanks!

Great recipe and oh so easy too! I added a splash of vanilla and used organic sugar. Baked 8 min. and let sit on the cookie sheet for a min. or two so they wouldn't be so fragile to transfer to the cooling rack. Perfect cookie and gluten free just for my guy! On half the batch I added a chocolate drop to the center..yummy

wowowowowo!  I did this with 10 splenda packets (instead of the 1 cup of sugar).  I added a splash of pure vanilla and baked for 10 minutes.  This is a MUST for someone on a low carb diet.  THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!  I would have never thought I could have PB cookies without flour.

VERY simple recipe! A breeze from start to finish.. and the taste?? SOO yummy! As one person commented, they are soo sweet that you will drink a large glass of water afterwards, but I dont' mind that. I think that next time, I will try to either cut the sugar by at least 1/4 cup, or do as some others suggested and use half brown sugar instead of regular sugar and see if that doesn't make them slightly less sweet. Regardless of that, I will be keeping this recipe and will use it again!

I normally hate it when someone rates a recipe BUT has changed it entirely!  BUT after reading many reviews I too made a few additions to the recipe.  I swapped half the white sugar for brown sugar (still using a total of 1 cup of sugar) and added 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp baking soda. After saying all that, these were the best peanut butter cookies EVER!  Hugh hit in my house!  Will make again and again!

So good and so easy!  I made it as is but doubled it.  It made about a dozen huge (a little smaller than my whole hand) cookies.  You can't mike them bite size because they will crumble.

This recipe was recommended on the Recipe Exchange a little while ago and I couldn't believe that it would actually work, so I headed into the kitchen to try it.  I made them as stated in the recipe, except I added about 3/4 cup of mini chocolate chips.  Oh my goodness!  The recipe really does work...and these are SO good!!  Although the directions say this doesn't make very many, I ended up with 26 (2-inch) cookies.  Thanks for a great, easy, quick cookie recipe!

I absolutely love this recipe and I have made it many times. I just finally got around to reviewing it. It is the easiest cookie recipe that you can find and it tastes simply delicious!  Also I think you could fool a lot of people into believing that this recipe has flour in it. It is so hard to believe that it doesn't! I know this recipe will be in my recipe box for many years to come. It will be used over and over again. And nothing beats these cookies with cold milk! My favorite!

These are super peanut buttery, but taste amazing.  I dbl'd the recipe using 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar. I also added 2 tsp of vanilla extract for a little extra flavor.  They took a little longer than 8 minutes in the oven, about 5 more minutes, but it could be my oven. Thanks for this great recipe!

The cookies came out awesome and yielded a dozen to the tee. The only problem I had (which I didn't downrate it for) was that it didn't take me 8 min to cook these cookies, it took me more like 20 minutes and I followed the ingredients to the "t".

These cookies came out GREAT! I did have to bake for 12-15 minutes rather than 8-10 minutes though.   I followed the advice of many by adding 1 tsp of vanilla extract. I also used confectioners sugar instead of plain white to help avoid grittiness. Try using chunky peanut butter for an added crunch! YUM! I Will def make these again!

I absolutely LOVED this recipe! it is by far the best peanut butter cookie ive had! and im lucky, becuase i have an allergy to gluten! 

a few tips: adding a teaspoon or two of vanilla can adden a bit more depth (but not everyone likes vanilla in pb cookies). next, you may need to bake them up to 15 mintues. You know they are done when they very tops and edges look ready or almost as though there is a "skin". then wait AT LEAST 5 minutes, or else they are simpy goo. dont put them back in if they dont seem cooked enough after 10 minutes or so. they harden nicely once they are fully cooled. 

THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS RECIPE!

I made a mistake. The dough was a bit sticky so I just sprinkled flour to make it managable. They stayed in balls and didn't cook in the middle. So the next batch I pressed a bit and they where perfect. My husband loves these more than my own recipe. Must use good tasting peanut butter.

this was a very quick and easy recipe! I made a double batch but only used 1 1/2 cups of sugar, 2 eggs and 2 cups of peanut butter. I was concerned because they were not ready after 8 min so I read a few reviews and I too had to double the time. Great easy treat!!

I've actually been making these cookies for quite some time now but am late giving a review. I loved these cookies and so did my husband. My mother-in-law even requested the recipe, yay! The big thing that impresses me about this cookie is the peanut butter shines through (which is expected by the amount of peanut butter and lack of other ingredients). Most PB cookie recipes use 1/2 cup of PB, and although some are yummy... they don't do a PB cookie justice. This one does! It satisfies that PB craving with the first cookie so I don't overindulge. Chopped nuts go well with this cookie as well... or even oreo cookie sprinkles on top... YUM!!

Add one more to the bunch - these are the best peanut butter cookies!  My hubby is the pb addict and he said these are the best I've ever made.  I am addicted to any kind of choc chip - and there are several 5+ on this site - but I've got to have some of these cookies because they are the yummiest I've tasted - the best way to say it is this:  If you're dreaming of peanut butter cookies that go perfect with milk, with out of this world peanut buttery taste...that literally melt in your mouth before you take that gulp of milk - make these NOW!  People will not believe the flour is missing! Update:  This is now the requested PB cookie in our house - fine with me since these are quick and easy!

These cookies are of the best I've tasted after making the following changes: 1 cup creamy JIF (only) peanut butter, 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup packed brown sugar, 1/2 tsp vanilla, 2 1/2 TBS flour (yes you need this), 1/2 tsp baking soda.  Mix all ingredients and refrigerate dough for at least 15 minutes. Press cookies in criss-cross fashion with a fork dipped in splenda. Bake in a 350 degree oven for 8 to 9 minutes (careful not to over bake). Remove from oven and immediately hand place 5 or 6 chocolate chips onto the tops of cookies.  Allow cookies to "rest" on cookie sheet for at least 5 minutes before removing with a spatula. Move cookies to wax paper and allow to cool completely for at least an hour (so that chocolate solidifies) and then store in an air tight tin. AWESOME!!! These cookies are so rich in flavor! My family loves them.  Definitely a keeper recipe - so easy to make. THANK YOU!

Thank you for a wonderful alternative!  My family and neighbors really enjoyed these.  I didn't change a thing (other that making the crisscross marks with a fork)and they came out perfect!!  I used the small cookie scoop from The Pampered Chef and was able to get 2 dozen cookies.  This is my new PB cookie recipe!  Next time I'll try it with a chunky PB.  :)

I did not like this recipe at all!  The cookies had a very grainy texture, and I was so disappointed!  I was anticipating moist and delicious cookies after reading all of the great reviews, but I was defintely let down when I pulled these out of the oven.  I will have to continue my search for the perfect peanut butter cookie :(

These turned out pretty good. They were good bite size cookies and great for everyone that loves peanut butter. They came out small the way the recipe is written. Next time I'm going to try doubling the batch, adding vanilla, and making the size bigger.

I used Jif Crunchy Peanut Butter w/ this recipe and followed other's advice about the sugar (1/4c white & 1/2c brown plus 1tsp vanilla).  I also turned it into the "kiss" cookie by adding Hershey's kisses immediately after pulling them from the oven.  

Doubling the recipe yielded 25 cookies.  

As far as flavor, they tasted more like peanut butter than any other recipe I've tried (including the one on the Hershey's Kiss bag!), so that's a plus.  Texture was a little gritty and the cookie was slightly oily.  They must have tasted good, because someone asked me for the recipe!

****TIP:  Don't bake on the bottom rack of your oven!  I thought I would be efficient by doing two pans at once and the lower rack starting burning the bottoms of the cookies just a few minutes in.

These are amazing in every way!  They are soooo easy and fast to make, and are delicious!  I made these for my daughter's preschool teacher who has Celiac disease as a present for Teacher Appreciation Week, and she, and the other parents she shared them with (including me), thought they were amazing.  She even asked me for the recipe.  :)

This recipe has been on the back of Kraft peanut butter jars for years. They are really good cookies. For those who gave it a bad review..perhaps it was the type of peanut butter used.  I often add  1/2 - 1 c. chocolate chips, a handful of oatmeal or chopped walnuts, or a combination of these ingredients.  Next, I will try it with butterscotch chips, maybe  3/4 c., and see how those are.  I also use less sugar, maybe 3/4 c. They are very versatile, easy to mix and match.

I used 3/4 light brown sugar, 1/4 white sugar, 1 tsp. vanilla, 1 egg, 1/2 tsp. baking powder, 1 cup semi-sweet mini chocolate chips. Turned out awesome! Only slightly crumbly when made this way, just don't overcook. They are done when middle is only slightly darker than the rest of the cookie.

Ok, I just tried these cookies, and they ARE THE BEST!!!  I did make several changes , though.  I used chunky PB, 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, added 1/2 tsp baking soda, about 1 tsp vanilla, about 1/2 cup choc. chips, and a couple of good sized spoonfuls of oatmeal, b/c the dough seemed a bit runny.  I lined my cookie sheet w/ aluminum foil and baked 11 min.  I practically ate them straight out of the oven! They were soft and chewy but the more they cooled they became a little crispier(but not hard).  Perfect for dunking in milk!  Will definately make these again, maybe next time w/ Splenda and Brown Sugar Splenda since I'm diabetic.

These cookies were fantastic!  I made them for work and the loved them - said they were the best Peanut Butter cookies they've had.  My 4 year old loved them as well.  I did add about a teaspoon of vanilla and made the batter to use the next morning so it cooled in the frig overnight.  So easy - I'll make these over and over again.

I really don't understand why these got so many great reviews...they don't come out like cookies. They're just blobs of peanut butter and sugar, and believe me, you can taste the sugar. I  made two batches and we threw both of them away!!!!

Like others I also used 1/2c of brown sugar and 1/2c of white and added vanilla. They were delish, however they were not done in the suggested 8 minutes of baking. After about 7 minutes I removed them from the oven to preforate them with a fork, I then put them back in for about 5-6 minutes. When I took them out I slso let them rest on the cookie sheet for about 1 minute, as they were very delicate, but perfect for a little "cheat" on my low-carb diet. =)

This recipe was fantastic!  My husband took one look at it and said he didn't believe it would work.  Boy, was he wrong!  I doubled the recipe and substituted 2 cups of Splenda for the 2 cups of sugar.  I also took the advise of others and added 1tsp of vanilla. I rolled them in balls then baked them for 5 min.  I then took them out and did the classic criscross patter on the top with a floured fork, then baked them for about 5 more minutes.  I did let them sit on the cookie sheet for a few minutes before removing them so they could set. My kids couldn't stop eating them.  Due to health reasons I can't have sugar and have to really watch my carbs.  These cookies really fit the bill.  Thanks for such a great recipe.  This will be a regular for me.

This recipe was great!!!!! It was quick, easy, and the ingredients were things I already had on hand. I added about a teaspoon of vanilla extract and had to bake them for about 12 minutes instead of 8 though. If you like peanut butter cookies you really should try these.

I have used this recipe several times.  I've used both crunchy and plain peanut butter..for some reason I like the plain better..it could be the brand.  Not sure.  Anyway,  these turn out much better if you dont cook them that long.  The ones I made yesterday were absolutely wonderful.  Soft, smooth, very yummy.  Would have been so much better if the dog wouldn't have been able to CHEW into one of the container...Well, needless to say our dog enjoys them also.  She had 4.

These cookies always turn out lovely and delicious. They are great when you have a craving for peanut butter cookies but don't have flour or the time to do traditional cookies. I sometimes add a few tablespoons of cocoa powder and a teaspoon of vanilla extract. Very yummy! I make these way too often. I use regular creamy peanut butter. Now that I am starting South Beach, I'll experiment with Splenda and report back.

These are good, but I'll stick with my regular PB cookies.  Definitely very easy.  I like my cookies fresh out of the oven, and these were too gooey that way.  They had better texture after cooling completely, but still a little gritty.  I love chocolate chip PB cookies, so I added chocolate chips to the second half of the batch (makes about 2 dozen 2" cookies), and that made them way too sweet.  Also had to cook longer than 8 minutes, and they brown too much on the bottom before they are done.

This was GREAT! I added a splash of vanilla to the dough. When the cookies were done I  sprinkled ground cinnamon over them! It turned out great.

Excellent, and easy to make with my 3 year old. I add a drop of vanilla to the dough and use brown sugar instead of white and they turn out great!

This was a quick and simple recipe.  Added approx 1/4 c. of organic quinoa flour and 4 minutes baking time to the initial batch.  After the taste test it was decided that future batches would have less sugar.  Cookies were very sweet.  Texture of the cookies was perfect, not too dry or crumbly but dry and crumbly enough according to PB cookie standards.  Will definitely make again.  Possibly with more add-ons and variations, seems like a very good foundation for experimentation.

Let me just say that while this cookie is good, it is not like the average peanut butter cookie you are probably looking for. It is lacking flour, and therefore tastes differently. It is still the same texture, but not as sweet. I am watching my carbs so I used splenda instead of sugar. This is a perfect cookie for low carbers who are looking for a treat every once in a while. I ate mine with sugar free whipped cream and was very satisfied.

I usually like my cookies very soft and chewy, but I love the little bit of crunch these have!  I made the first batch with reduced fat pb, not so good.  Also, 2 extra ounces of pb will change the whole recipe, and not for the better at all.  Add the vanilla and bake 10 minutes.  They are great!

My husband's grandmother has refused for YEARS to give me her peanut butter cookie recipe.  I've tried recipes over the years to try to make her cookies for my husband, always failing.  Finally I saw this recipe, and decided to give it a shock.  My husband's words when he tried them were "she finally caved?"  YES!  SUCCESS!!!  Thank you!!!

These cookies were not good.  Eating them gave me a headache.  The bottoms burn easily if you are not careful and if you undercook, the middles are mushy.
I really wanted to like these cookies after all the good reviews.

Instant gratification!  These tasted great and were done in no time.  I added chocolate chips and sprinkled chopped walnuts on top.  Tasted like a lot more effort was put into them than was required!  We'll be making these all the time.

Wow! I have to admit I didn't trust this recipe at first...so I added some flour...And it tasted disgusting! So I did EXACTLY what this recipe says,and it was so delicious!!! I added a splash of vanilla that most people have suggested...and this is awesome! And so easy to make! I'll use low fat peanut butter and 1/4 of brown sugar next time...Or it'll be too sweet..

Horrible. The flavor is very off. The cookies burn on the bottoms very easily, and the texture is chewy in an unpleasant way. And they lay in the pit of your stomach like a brick. Do yourself a favor and make peanut butter cookies the old fashioned way.

Absolutely Delicious! I didn't want to make a huge mess measuring out the peanut butter so I doubled the recipe and used a 16 ounce jar of peanut butter, 2 eggs and 2 cups of Splenda to make them flourless and sugar-free. I flattened them with a fork and they were the best peanut butter cookies ever!!

This cookies are great.  Definitely need to bake longer then 8 minutes - I went 12 and was perfect.  Next time, I'll add some vanilla and blend the white sugar with brown, 1/2 & 1/2.

I gave this recipe 4 stars for ease but it would have been 3 just based on taste and texture. A good quick snack but I wouldn't make these for company or to take somewhere. Next time I may add a little vanilla for more taste.

Delicious.  Try adding another egg to this recipe. It makes the cookies chewier and they hold together well:) I also threw in a few mini chocolate chips for a nice treat:)

My daughter wanted to bake peanut butter cookies with her friend.  And I was looking for some easy recipe.  It is definitely easiest cookie’s recipe I ever heart. It took just 5 minutes to prepare dough.  Cookies themselves came tasty and crunchy. However, I cannot give 5 stars, only 4 – it is not a greatest recipe ever.  
In addition: my friend who is allergic to weeds found this recipe very handy!

I have been making this recipe since high school (too many years ago!).  I haven't read all the reviews, but I do have a few notes about these...hope I am not repeating too much...

*These double, triple, whatever nicely

*Let them cool on the pan for a bit before trying to move them to the rack becsuse they are fragile just out of the oven

* I like to add chocolate or peanut butter chips, M&M's, peanuts, etc... sometimes for variation

* I always add a tsp of vanilla for flavor as well

I got a similar recipe from my mother, calls for 1/2 tsp of vanilla, roll into 1" balls and press with fork before baking. Bake for 12-15 min at 350. Use Chunky peanut butter instead of creamy. I will try using 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white and adding the kiss the next time I make. Great for a quicky to heat the kitchen on a cold winters day :)

The best peanut butter cookies ever!!!  I used natural peanut butter and 1/2 cup white, 1/2 brown sugar.  I'll cut back on that the next time.  I got 2 dozen cookies made with batter left over, they are great!

I would rate the cookie ok. It has a crunchy outside with a sorta chewy inside. It is definitely a peanut buttery experience. I added mini M&Ms for some flavor.  It was GOOD! I also doubled the recipe so that it was double the fun. This is definitely something your kids would love (especially eating the batter). It is a treat for the whole family.

These are definitely for the peanut butter lovers out there! They were wonderful and a huge hit...especially with my little one. I would definitely double the recipe next time I make them. Who would have thought that with just a few ingredients that you would get such an amazing cookie. Thank you Stephanie!

I didn't like these - I guess I am a fan of flour.  However if you can't eat flour these are worth making - once they cool they taste better and they are chewy. But I like a good old fashioned peanut butter cookie.

MUCH too sweet. I use pure peanut butter (pureed peanuts only, no additives, no sugar), so I can't imagine what these would taste like with commercial PB that has added sugar in it!! If I made these again I would use less sugar (perhaps 1/4c less) and a bit of flour to offset the graininess caused by the sugar and give it a more shortbread-like consistency. Otherwise, these were probably the easiest cookie I've ever made, and would probably be a big hit with kids.

I think I must prefer regular peanut butter cookies.  These weren't bad but they didn't have a cookie chewiness.  Instead it was like a candy chewiness.  They reminded me of the Halloween candy that comes in black and orange wax paper.  For those who can't have or don't want flour, this would be great.  Otherwise, I'd stick with a more traditional recipe.

These are so easy and so gooooooood.  I advise letting them cool for about 5 minutes to allow them to set up before taking them off the pan.  They take so little time and effort but you'd never know it when you taste them.  MMMMMMMMMM. Yummy!

These yummy cookies are so easy!  I added about 2 tbs of flour, a dash of cinnamon and vanilla.  Since I made tablespoon sized cookies, they had to cook for 13 minutes.  They are delicious and chewy and my whole family loved them.  This is my peanut butter cookie recipe from now on!

Okay cookie to make when you're short on time and ingredients. We personally thought they didn't taste very good. They were too grainy and crumbly. I think I'll stick to the traditional PB cookie recipes.

This is a good, quick, and easy recipe. I did make a few adjustments as suggested in another review. Instead of a whole cup of white sugar, I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and a little less than 1/2 cup white sugar. I also added 1/2 tsp. vanilla and about 3 TBL of flour. I baked then for 10 minutes for soft cookies, and a few minutes longer for crisp cookies. Both ways are great! Peanut butter is one of my sons only sources of protien and he loves these cookies!!!

I read all the reviews before trying this recipe and after going over everythig I decided to try it with 2 eggs, chunky peanut butter and a longer baking time and presto! they came out fluffy, not too sweet, very peanut buttery and tasty :o)

I would definatly make these again! My daughter gets WIC and its a great way to use up alllll the eggs and peanut butter that never usually gets eaten. Tastes GREAT with milk too.. might be nice to top them with a chocolate kiss :)

The recipe was easy to put together, but
the cooking time was too short. I used
all natural peanut butter, so the cookies
were just sweet enough, but they were
crumbly. It just didn't work well.

I have these cookies several times and loved them 5 stars. This time I made as the recipe states (love these) and then made a second batch using the suggestions folks made which was 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar instead of the 1 cup of white sugar  and added1 tsp of vanilla. The original recipe  was definitely best.  The brown sugar cookies cooked much faster so if you use the changes folks recommended be careful and watch the cookies carefully.

These "Flourless Peanut Butter Cookies Recipe" are a great treat. I made mine with natural peanut butter and cane sugar  The first time I made them, my cookie dough (dropped by the teaspoon) did not spread when I baked them and had a texture my girlfriend described as "earthy" (I would say "chunky.") They were good, but I decided to try a different approach. The second time I made them, I halved the sugar (1/2 cup instead of 1 cup), portioned the dough with my ice cream scoop, rolled it into balls, and flattened to make cookies. This resulted in slightly softer more uniformly-shaped cookies which surprisingly still tasted very sweet (despite halving the sugar). I liked both versions of this cookie, which were quite different from each other despite being made with almost identical ingredients. Thank you Stephanie T. for sharing this recipe.

Best peanut butter cookies ever! So easy. I used both the brown & white sugar as well as the vanilla, as mentioned in other reviews, doubled the recipe...soooo yummy. Next time I wouldn't flatten out as much, thought I read that did not spread, mine did but still great.

Not edible.  :(  I used Kraft Smooth Peanut Butter, and followed the recipe as written - and ended up with a sheet of half-burned gooey peanut sugar substance that had a bizarre grainy texture and tasted like sugar with an oily peanut after-thought.

Delicious! You can't even tell they don't have flour in them!! I used 1/2 C brown sugar + 1/4 C white sugar and added 1 tsp. pure (gluten-free) vanilla extract. Stirred all together in bowl, dropped by 1/2 Tablespoonfuls and baked. They didn't flatten on their own, so we needed to flatten with a fork to the width we wanted the cookies to end up at. Easiest and fastest cookies I've ever made!

WOW! These were incredible. After reading the reviews I doubled the batch, reduced the sugar to 1.5cups (one cup white, 1/2 cup brown) and added 1 tsp baking soda, 2 tsp vanilla, and a pinch of salt. Made smaller, two bite cookies and baked for 7-8 minutes. They turned out perfect! Peanut butter-y and not too sweet!

This one didn't really click for me.  It was okay, but maybe just to simple?  Too sweet?  Can't put my finger on it. I did split between brown sugar and sugar, added a bit of vanilla.  After the first batch, I added cocoa as per another review, but still didn't really like them.  Guess I'll stick with classic PB cookies.

Simply DELICIOUS! I used 1/2 c. of brown sugar, 1/4 cup white sugar, 1 tsp. of vanilla, 1/2 tsp. of baking powder,and a few dashes of salt. I also recommend using a fork to score the top before baking. Be sure to lightly grease the pan and bake for about 8-10 minutes. Absolutely yummy with chocolate chips :)

Best PB cookie recipe ever. I have made these numerous times now. sometimes changing it just a bit each time. I usually add a TSP cvanilla and use half white half brown sugar. Also tried it with some chocolate chips which is great too. The last couple times also added a couple TBS flour and 1/2 TSP baking soda and I found that makes them even better for us but is great just as written as well. I never knew I was a PB cookie lover until I made these. The simplicity of making them is an added bonus. From Start to finish and able to be  eating a fresh baked delicious cookie in about 15 minutes.

I gave these 5 stars because they are so fast and easy to make, and I usually have the three ingredients on hand to whip them up at any time. I cut the sugar in half and using Skippy PB that made them sweet enough for me.

The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because they were way too sweet, even though I reduced sugar by 1/4 cup. I can't imagine how much sweeter they'd have been if I'd used regular PB with added sugar as opposed to natural PB. I did use 25% white sugar and 75% brown. Next time I'll reduce sugar by half-- just a personal preference. Otherwise, these came out fantastic. Texture was perfect, and mine were done in 9 minutes, just slightly brown at the edges. They were crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside even when cooled. I will use this recipe for years to come. Thank you!!

These were pretty good and very rich! My family is gluten free so these were great for us. I used half white sugar and half brown sugar. The dough was much thicker than what they showed in the movie. My daughter was able to roll them. We squished then down with a fork and their shape didn't change at all in the oven. I cooked them according to the recipe but because of the thickness I should have added more time in the oven. Also they were very crumbly but no one in my family complained as they gobbled them up! haha

I have made this recipe as written and enjoyed it for its ingredients. To make it sugarless I made peanut butter by blending peanuts in my Vitamixer, substituted Splenda for sugar, added a Tbs of vanilla and substituted ground flax seed for the egg. Thank you Stephanie T.

I'm not crazy about peanut butter cookies, but I LOVE these.  I had a feeling they would be awful because of the lack of flour,  but they were absolutely delicious.  Soft, chewy, super easy.  I mixed them up using a hand beater , formed the dough into a ball, and let it chill in the refrigerator for about 10 minutes to firm it up.  The dough will seem oily, but don't worry about it.   I rolled them in 1" balls and put them on cookie sheets lined with parchment paper, then flattened them slightly with a dinner fork to make a crisscross pattern , then sprinkled them lightly with Wilton white sparkling sugar.  I baked them at 325 degrees, not 350, for about 10 minutes, just until they were set.  They will look underbaked, but they will firm up after you take them out of the oven.  It is essential to let these cookies cool completely on the cookie sheets before you remove them, otherwise they will fall apart.  Because I used parchment paper, it was super easy to take the cookies off the sheets.  I didn't even have to use a spatula, just picked them up off the sheets with my hand.  These cookies are keepers!  Will make again.

Tried this recipe for my husband because he can't eat wheat and it was a total hit.  You wouldn't even know that they didn't have flour.  I am not a very seasoned baker, so I don't know for sure, but I would think you could toss in some more ingredients like oatmeal or choc chips.  Careful with the cooking times, I burnt the bottoms of the first batch at 10 mins.  Great recipe, thanks!!

On the back of the peanut butter jar :) Mine however says 1/2 cup sugar and they still taste great. Only thing is they are fairly gooey so I wouldn't suggest rolling them in your hands. Just plop onto a sheet with a spoon. I made jumbo ones so I got about 6 of them with a smaller left over cookie :P

These are really easy and really good! The recipe didn't say anything about flattening the cookies, and I think I will next time- they are a bit under cooked in the middle. I did use 1/2 sugar and 1/2 Splenda to cut down on the sugar content a bit. I will make these again.

Update-- we have cut our sugar even further, so for my benefit, here's the modification:
Beat 1 egg with 1tsp vanilla, 1/4c erythritol, 1/8c sugar, and 3T of PB2. Add in 1/4c crunchy peanut butter and 1/2c oatmeal. Had to bake them 13 min.

These went over well with my family. I did double the recipe, used 1/2 and 1/2 brown and white sugars, and added baking soda and vanilla as another review recommended. I wonder if using natural peanut butter would cut down on the oiliness of the cookies because they are hard to work with. Definitely do not want to overcook. 8 minutes was great, even though they come out very soft at first. Once cooled completely they stay together well.

Yummy recipe. I used reduced fat peanut butter, and 1/2 the sugar and 1 tsp of vanilla extract. The texture is great, the flavor can't be beat, and there's never enough for my kids!

This is a well loved, well used recipe at our house. No changes needed to be able to give it five stars. Since I am on a no/low sodium diet I DO use all natural peanut butter which is sodium free and they come out great. I also use Nevia [similar to Splenda, I guess] to cut the calories and still...FANTASTIC!
 
I have also made them with regular peanut butter, regular sugar and crunchy peanut butter - heck I even made them with PEA-nut butter which is a nut free butter that simulates peanut butter and they were fabulous tasting. And a nice gift for the kids in my daughter's marching band that have nut allergies. They couldn't believe they could have "peanut" butter cookies too.

Don't be shy- use what you have - but you honestly can make them exactly as written and they come out fabulous.
 
Gotta go! I have a batch coming out of the oven soon. Peanut butter chocolate chip. YUM!

Yum!!  Quick and easy.  I added a teaspoon of real vanilla and a tablespoon of flour.  I rolled the cookie dough balls in some organic sugar before baking.  The cookies were gone in one day.  I like the smaller batch because I would eat too many!!

Thanks for the recipe.

I made a version of these yet tried to make them a bit healthier.  I don't really recommend my version that much unless you must go healthier.  I used organic peanut butter made from peanuts ONLY (no salt, no sugar, [no jif, no skippy]).  I used Truvia in place of sugar.  I did add vanilla - about 1 1/2 teaspoons.  They came out pretty good and I can eat them but I am sure they are better following recipe given. I am a personal trainer and I just wanted these as a high-protein sweet treat.  If that's your goal too, try it out!!

These are good, but I would probably reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup next time. I reduced it to 3/4 cup and they were sickly sweet and really chewy. Or, I would use natural peanut butter instead and use the full amount of sugar. Side note; I got 24 cookies making them teaspoon size.

Sweet gluten-free recipe! 

For almond lovers, i suggest substituting the peanut butter with almond butter, adding about one quarter of a cup's worth of sliced almonds and 1/8 of a cup's worth of dried cranberries. Add 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract, 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda (as someone wisely suggested in another comment) and 1/2 cup's worth of brown sugar (on top of the 1 cup of white sugar in the original recipe). Cook slightly longer, about 9 minutes (as almond butter is a bit more liquid than peanut butter) but at the same indicated temperature. 

Share with friends around big glasses of almond milk! :)

With my changes I give it 5 stars.  Although I've made them both ways and they're gooooood.  I subbed 1/3c brown sugar for the same of white.  I added a splash (!/2?) tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp baking soda.

Delicious. We do not care one way or another about things being gluten free and it was delicious nonetheless! I made exactly as the recipe stated - yum, yum, yum!  However, I will say that I doubled the recipe and easily made 40 average-ish cookies - I used a little cookie dough scoop.

I LOVE these cookies!  So very easy to make and everyone loves them.  Usually I mix chocolate chips in.

Today I used 1/2 fine white sugar and 1/2 Stevia, and then substituted greek yogurt for the egg (outta eggs).  They turned out great.  

Stevia is a little on the sweet side, but I like it.  I've just started using it and this was my first experience baking with it.

These cookies are so ridiculously easy to make that I almost decided I'd never make the traditional peanut butter cookies again.  ha!

The trick to these cookies is giving them time to cool.  If you pick them up too soon, you have a crumbly, gooey mess on your hands.  If you're patient, it's a darn good cookie when you're low on ingredients and don't have the energy for "real" cookies, per se.

Deliciously chewy and easy to make. Followed the advice of other reviewers and added 1 tsp vanilla and changed the sugar to 1/4 cup white, 1/2 cup brown. Made these small so they aren't too overwhelming! Love them.

These were delicious!  I used natural peanut butter.  I also made them into kissy cookies by rolling the rolling the dough in sugar before baking and then the last few minutes I pressed a Hershey's kiss into the cookie.  Yum!

I made these cookies because they are gluten free and I replaced the sugar with stevia. They taste great but they are a little dry. I may have over baked them a little which could have been the cause. Overall a great recipe that I would recommend to anyone.

These are amazing. I am surprised since they didnt have flour. I did three versions of this recipe. The first was the original recipe. The second was half crunchy half creamy peanut butter and a Tbs of vanilla. The third was entirely crunchy with the added vanilla. Our favorite was the second. It gives the cookies the peanuty taste with the crunch of peanuts. plus this made 12 large cookies each, but I used an overflowing tablespoon to drop on the cookie sheet. So it would make more if you dropped a smaller amount at a time. Deinately being saved in my cook book!

Yummy is right. I made these for my husband for father's day, and he ate 5 at one time before realizing it. I also had my fair share.
I doubled the recipe and it made 48 cookies, and this was a mix of teaspoon and tablespoon size cookies - so I would have been fine without doubling it. They are not very pretty if you don't smush them with a criss cross with a fork, but they still taste very good. Stick to the eight minutes(maybe nine depending on the size), because they don't really brown on the edges to know that they are done. Mixing was done best with a wooden spoon or spatula.
Just because, I added a teeaspoon of vanilla. 
So yes very good and very simple - a keeper!

These are delicious!!! Made them for a friend at church. He could not believe they had no flour. He shared them with a few people and they have all asked me to make them again. Had the same appearance as regular peanut better cookies and made quite a few cookies as well.

Absolutely love these cookies. They are easy and I can make great use of my peanut butter. And they are fabulous just the way they are without any adjustments. Of course for those who prefer less sugar or low fat..The choice of peanut butter is up to you. And cutting a bit of sugar out works too. I make these cookies with both regular peanut butter (of all brands) and even with crunchy peanut butter too. They all work fine.

Absolutely loved these and served them to my guests who eat a  gluten free  diet. I added a chocolate kiss for a little something extra. Also, I rolled these into balls before baking so they took a bit longer than 8 mins. More like 14.

You get out what you put in. They're okay for what they are, but certainly nothing special. They taste good, but then again - it's peanut butter and sugar. What wouldn't taste good about that?

These were super easy and tasty.  But I doubled the recipe and halved the sugar.  Peanut butter is sweet enough I think.

Not sure why these are rated so high... they werent all that good. I actually ended up throwing them out. They were super greasy and didnt hold their form very well. They didnt taste very well either. And the bottom was hard even when I cooked them the recommended 8 minutes.

I made these cookies with creamy Smuckers natural peanut butter, and they did not work out!  After combining the everything, it was just crumbles in my mixing bowl, so I had to press them together to form them.  They taste too sweet.

Best peanut butter cookies I've ever made. Super quick, easy, and delicious. Great recipe for beginning bakers. I added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla

These came out very well. I used half a cup almond butter and half a cup peanut butter and also on the recommendations of other reviewers, added 1 tsp of vanilla extract.  I made the cookies very small -- only appx 1 tbsp of batter per cookie -- and I think that worked out pretty well.

Embarrassingly simple, but so worth it.  I make these all the time and add peanut butter chips (so gooooood).  If you haven't tried them yet, give it a shot.  If you don't like them, it's not as if you wasted a lot of time or money.

This is such a great cookie!  You will not believe that it is flourless.  They are awesome.  Especially if you are looking for something to make for someone who can not have wheat products!
I made these last spring for a golf outing for our dinner and everyone loved them!  Easy enough for even the little ones to help you make!

Cookies were perfect only when they were hot out of the oven. After that they were just too dense and crunchy. They had a lot of pb flavor which is good, but the flour probably adds the necessary lightness to make them chewy. I will not use this recipe again.

Yummy! At first I was a bit skeptical that they would turn out, my splash of vanilla was a really big splash haha. They were really gooey looking. After coming out of the oven and sitting a little bit, they were really delicious! They're kinda lumpy but they taste great!

Awful, I followed the instructions but apparently something is missing and this came out cumbly and not quite a cookie feel.  I dont have enough experience with cookies to figure out the problem.  They didnt taste good either, they were to sugary.

I make these any time my sweet tooth kicks in because they are so quick and easy to make. I add 1 tsp. of vanilla. I also make the dough into balls and make crisscrosses with a fork dipped in sugar. My only warning: make a double batch. These are THE best peanut butter cookies ever made!

These were solidly good peanut butter cookies, though not fabulous. HOWEVER, they are fabulous considering the amount of work you have to put into them - almost nothing! One minute of throwing the ingredients together, 10 minutes of baking, done! Two dozen peanut butter cookies. These cookies are tasty enough and amazingly fast/convenient, therefore they will show up in my cooking again and again.

Amazing!!   Some versions substitute splenda for the sugar and some add a tsp. of vanilla but any way you do these they are the easiest I have ever made. 
I use the real sugar in mine and sometimes I do not use vanilla and I always chill the dough a little before rolling into small balls and using the fork in the sugar to make the criss crosses on top.  Man these are THE BEST peanut butter cookies on the planet!!!!

I don't know if it's because I used store brand peanut butter, but they turned out very dry... I made them again with Jif and they were 5 stars. Make sure you have a glass of milk handy!

Not bad, doubled the recipe. Wish I would have added vanilla. But for a three ingredient recipe that takes 15 minutes to get a finished treat, pretty handy. I topped my second pan with melted milk chocolate.

This was good I just have to experiment with cooking times cause 8 mins was not long enough and they did tend to fall apart when I took them off the pan.  I used chunky pb dont know if that could be a reason but the flavor was good.

They stuck to the pan, so the next batch we used parchment paper.  Also, the second batch sat a bit after mixing and I guess the sugar absorbed some of the egg liquid, because it was much easier to shape the cookies- less goopy.

They tasted great and made an easy treat when we were on vacation and didn't have all our usual pantry staples in the cabin.

I couldn't believe that these ingredients would actually result in a cookie, much less a really great peanut butter cookie!  Like other reviewers I did add a dash of vanilla.

This is a great recipe to use as is or to adapt. I have made them several times. I have added mini m & ms which are also gluten-free and my husband likes them with 1/2 cup ground oats in them. I have also made them for someone who has both gluten and peanut allergies. I just use almond or sunflower seed butter.

I have used this recipe successfully for about a year.  4 stars because (1) I recommend you flatten them with a fork or they won't bake right, (2) I recommend you bake them on foil so you can lift them off the sheet more easily and (3) I recommend you use 1 cup sugar only if you are using natural peanut butter because if your PB brand has sugar, you won't need a whole cup more!  If you like peanut butter fudge, you'll love these cookies!

These turned out very well. They were delicious, and nice and peanut buttery and sweet.  I dipped the fork in water and used it to press the cookies and sprinkled them with sugar.  I also topped each one with a semi sweet chocolate chip after I pulled them out of the oven.  Very good, and my sweet husband liked them too!

I'm a huge fan of peanut butter and was intrigued by the short ingredient list and had to try it simply for the curiosity factor.
The recipe indeed worked and I can see this being a great alternative for those who can't eat flour. However, I found the texture a bit grainy and dry, and the flavor was a bit bland, even after adding a dash of salt & vanilla. I also didn't particularly like using up so much peanut butter at once and didn't feel like the flavor was that much more 'peanuty' than other peanut butter cookies I've tried.

These were good cookies. Simple, fast and tasty. They are really rich so you can only eat a few at a time. Definately worth making. Thanks!

So easy, so yummy! You MUST add some salt. It just makes them so much better. About a generous pinch is enough. So good :)

Mmm, what could be better than peanut butter cookies than flourless peanut butter cookies. I have to admit I was skeptical about not adding flour but this simple 3 ingredient recipe was by far the best I have ever had (store bought or made). My husband and kids absolutely kept coming back for more. The taste was crunchy on the outside, soft inside, and peanut butter through and through. This is definitely a recipe that will kept in my recipe book.

ehh OK for a few ingredients.  It's a good cookie not great. Defiantly need to make the traditional cross hatch and keep them on the small side. When I just dropped spoonfuls the bottoms burned but remained raw in the middle. And they get better when cool. You know not the best but a good quick cookie!

I love these. My friend gave me this recipe and I wondered if people knew about how simple they were! Well apparently people do know! I like to add a few drops of vanilla extract and even some cinnamon when I make them. I cook them on the shorter side because I love it when they're still gooey and soft.

Loved them!  I made these for myself beacuse of food alergies.  I took some advice from other posts and made these changes.  I used 3/4 C brown sugar and 1/4 C white sugar.  I added chocolate chips to the mixture. ( just enough to look right)  I made sure to flaten out the dough with a fork on the cookie sheet because they dont rise. (how they look on the sheet is how they come out)  Also, be careful when removing them from the cookie sheet because they are very soft.  They ferm up quickly as they cool.  They tasted awsome.  I will try and add the vanilla extract next time but I dont think needs it.  Thanks.

I'm giving this 4 stars because I thought that the instructions are a little off. This recipe makes more than 6, it made me about 14 decent sized cookies, and even then they were a little large. I had to cook mine for about 10 mins, and they were still a little gooey >_

Healthier Variation:
Use egg substitue (lower cholesterol), low fat peanut butter (less fat) & splenda (Sugar free) and you will not taste the difference.  
I was going to add this recipe!  This is easy and I love using it in a fix.  Cause you can have a bag of these for any occasion in less than 20 min.  They taste great!

I am an avid baker, and never have I had something turn out as poorly as this really simple cookie. These were super greasy and practically glued to my cookie sheet when they came out. They are so chewy my jaw hurt after eating just one.  

Obviously, a lot of people like them, so I don't know where I went wrong. I used natural peanut butter, and I am guessing that is what accounts for the pools of grease - maybe there is more oil than the Jif types - though the few other times I've made traditional PB cookies, I've never had an issue with natural PB. So, I don't know, but these obvioulsy didn't work for me.

I followed the recipe exactly using Jif crunchy peanut butter.  They were very good - nice & crunchy.  I put a little shortening on a pizza pan and pressed the cookies flat to make a very thin cookie.  So easy and quick.  Satisfied my middle of the night sweet tooth tout suite.

I love this recipe.  Yes, very peanut buttery and sweet.  But, you can tell by the ratio of pb to sugar that it's going to be so be sure to adjust the amount of sugar.  I almost always put less sugar in my cookies.  I found that hand mixing the ingredients gives the cookies a better texture.  Be sure to cook them just until the start to crack.  Like I said I use less sugar, but then I turn around and add chocolate chips.  I know, crazy, but I love chocolate and peanut butter.

After reading the other reviews, I changed up the recipe by 1) adding 1 teaspoon vanilla and 2) using 1/4 cup sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of 1 cup sugar.  I baked the cookies for 8 minutes and they came out perfectly.  Everyone loved them!

These turned out great! Used Jiff all natural peanut butter, only three-fourths cup of organic sugar. Added 1 tsp. of vanilla.
 I had to cook them for about 10 minutes instead of 8. The normal batch made approximately 24 medium sized cookies. Make sure to handle them carefully when warm because they crumble very easily. So delicious! Very creamy and dreamy!

SO Good! I quadrupled the recipe and it made about 55 medium sized cookies. And I used half white sugar and half brown sugar. I also cooked them for more like 10-11 minutes. SO EASY!

I followed others comments and did 3/4 cups of sugar with 1tsp vanilla and 1/2 baking soda. I also put some nutella on the cookie afterwards.  I love chocolate though. All in all super simple and tasty!!

This were just not good.  I had high expectations with all the great reviews.  I doubled the recipe & added vanilla & chocolate chips.  They were incredibly gooey so I didn't bother trying to shape them.  At 8 minutes they were definitely NOT cooked so I almost doubled the time...and they somehow were both gooey & very crumbly.  Almost burnt tasting, but without actually having the texture of a normal cookie.  I'm at altitude between 4500-5000 so I don't know if that could have been part of the problem, but these definitely did not turn out as well at all.

I've been making these forever but I only just bothered to look up the recipe that I found so many years ago. I make them for my family all the time and they love them (and are always shocked that I don't use flour). We don't find them too sweet, nor have we had problems with gritty sugar texture. Weird. Thanks!

Love this recipe.  We've been making them this way for over 20 yrs but it had been so long I couldn't remember the over time so was I glad when I found it here.  We used to call them Magic 1 Cup Cookies

I love peanut butter cookies so I tried these because so many people raved about how great they were. I even followed the suggestions of using 1/4 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar as well as adding the vanilla. These are way too sugary for me.

I make cookies twice or three times a month, and like to try out new recipes. The original recipe gives you a dense, sugary cookie that does not spread when baked, so I reduced the sugar down to 2/3 cup (mix of brown and white) and slightly flatten the dough balls with the bottom of a sugared glass before pressing them with a fork. Very cute cookies and would be great for a bake sale

My sister-in-law is lactose and gluten intolerant and she LOVED these cookies! She now has a freezer full to keep her going since they're so easy to make and don't cost a fortune (gluten free stuff is overpriced).  Thank you so much for sharing!

Pretty good!  I used 1/2 turbinado sugar and 1/2 honey instead of the white sugar, added about 1/2 cup more peanut butter, and also added some chocolate chips.  Definitely needs to be eaten with lots of milk!

These cookies get 5 stars for taste, they are as peanut butter as it gets short of eating out of the jar. They get 4 stars, though because the texture is a bit off putting. I'd make these again, but definitely not the best peanut butter cookies.

I'm rating them four stars because I don't care for peanut butter. I made them for my husband and he loved them... I doubled the amount of the listed ingredients (1 cup of splend and 1 cup of  brown sugar) plus 1 tsp vanilla extract, 2 Tbs of flour and 1/4 cup of nut and chocolate chips. Baked for 11 mins and let cool completely before moving. Although I don't care for peanut I must say the recipe is great!!!

I grew up eating my mom's PB cookies and never dreamed such a simple recipe could possibly taste as good as hers.  She spent a lot of time carefully measuring out all the ingredients and making every cookie exactly the same.  It doesn't need to be difficult to be AWESOME!  One small note:;  I only had super size eggs on hand so did have to add about 1/2 cup of flour and 1 tsp. baking powder.  I also cut back a little on sugar (3/4 instead of 1 cup) and they were yummy! I rolled the dough into balls and squashed with a sugar dipped fork and recipe made 2 dozen good sized cookies.  Highly recommend this recipe.  CAUTION:  DO NOT LAST VERY LONG UNLESS YOU HIDE THEM =D

Rich and dense, these are cookies for true pb lovers!  Used a fork to flatten the balls, it worked well.  One bad thing, they are crumbly, so they don't travel very well. But delicious!

The recipe as written is great.  I have also used it to make peanut blossom cookies.  Make the recipe as written, roll the dough balls in sugar and bake.  Add a hershey kiss in the center after you take them out of the oven.  AMAZING.

Hey, for 3 ingredients, what more would you want?  I would probably like a bit more texture, but if you like really peanut buttery cookies, can't go wrong with these.  Don't you hate when you have a PB cookie that doesn't tast that much like PB?!

These were so simple and delicious.  My batter was very crumbly, so I had to roll into balls with my hands instead of just scooping out, but they were still delicious.  My husband hasn't quit raving about them and refuses to share!

Quick and easy peanut butter cookies. I doubled the ingredients, used 1 1/3 cups brown sugar, 2/3 cups granulated, 2 eggs, 2 cups of peanut butter. My biggest complaint is that the dough is SO sticky. So very, very sticky. I had to keep dusting my hands in sugar to get them out of my hands. I couldn't press them with a fork, so had to flatten in my sugar-crusted hands. Cooked for approximately 12 minutes. THESE ARE DONE BEFORE THEY SEEM DONE! The tops will still be very soft when you take them out. 3 stars due to ridiculously sticky batter.

The flavor of these were outstanding, this is SERIOUS peannuty flavor! Having said that, I added a teensy bit to the recipe, hence the 4 star rating instead of 5. I subbed brown sugar for the white and cut it down to 3/4 cup, added a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla, 3 tbsp of flour (so mine weren't "flourless") and I used natural unsweetened peanut butter WHICH IS KEY! Mine baked for 10 minutes, I removed them before they were actually done and let them sit for 5 minutes on the baking sheet. These cookies are very delicate (texturally), overcook them and they just get too crumbly to even handle; you MUST take them out before they're fully cooked if you want them to stay soft and tender. Also, make sure you flatten them to the desired thickness when you make the fork marks on top because they don't really spread at all.

VERY crumbly and not much for the flavor either.  I guess if you want cookie crumbles in a pinch this will work!

I'm not usually a fan of peanut butter cookies, but these were great, and so easy to make!  They're really rich and peanut-buttery, and the beauty of it is that they only take 3 ingredients.  Why mess that up by changing the recipe all around when it's completely unneccessary?  Just remember to flatten them with a fork before baking!

Awesome cookies! I doubled the batch as suggested by a review I had read and got 3 dozen, 2" diameter cookies using a rounded tablespoon measuring spoon.  I baked the first batch for 8 minutes and thought it need to brown a bit more.  The second and third batches I baked for 13 minutes and they browned nicely but after a day of storage, I prefered the 8 minute batch cookies as they were a touch softer than the 13 minute batches.  DH and I are trying to budget our meals and this is a perfetct, budget-friendly treat as we always have these ingredients on hand ;) Thanks for sharing!

Made these last week, the only thing I did differently was take the advice of other reviewers and add a bit of vanilla. They were very flavorful, melt in your mouth and everyone loved them! Will make again

my husband and i found that these cookies tasted even better  the day after i baked them!  he brought 3 dozen to work with him and they were all gone by lunch!  this was a nice, easy recipe and wasn't as messy to make as cookies can tend to be, because there was no flour!  this would make a great cookie to bake with kids!!!!!

Wonderful! Made these for my friend with celiac disease and they turned out great! I doubled the recipe and came out with 4 dozen decent sized cookies (~2 inches diameter). I wouldn't have doubled it if I knew it made so many.

These are by far the best cookies! I alter my recipe a little bit. Use just 1/2cup of sugar, and add a splash of vanilla. When you drop the cookies onto your baking sheet, press a few chocolate chips into the tops, instead of using the fork! Saves a step, also adds a tasty extra! These cookies never hang around the house long!

These were really good and really simple...the trick to making them is not over cooking them...pull them out of the oven and they still cook on the pan.

Yum! I have been searching for a gluten free cookie and this is the best one I've found so far! What's even better is that it uses a few ingredients that I already normally buy.  I added chocolate chips & vanilla extract to mine and they turned out great! They are really rich, the perfect way to satisfy a sweet tooth! Thanks for sharing :)

I wasn't intentionally looking for a gluten free cookie, I just happened to run out of flour so I looked for a recipe that didn't call for it... So maybe I had high expectations. My mother thought I was nuts for even trying to bake these, but surprisingly, they're not half bad. I did the recipe like a few others, 1/2 cup sugar 1/2 cup brown sugar, and add a tsp of vanilla. It made about 15 cookies but the one batch just would not brown. I HIGHLY suggest using a dark cookie sheet, and even baking them longer. I baked them for 8 minutes and it's been two hours and they're still not hardened. For being such a simple and quick recipe, this was good. I've had better but this was a pleasant surprise and my mom actually liked them. In fact, I've baked them 3 times, once a day, and everyone devours them. Thank you for this recipe :)  P.S. Spray the cookie sheet with some Pam before baking.

Great recipe!  I used 1 cup of brwn sugar which made it much sweeter, and used a teaspoon to sccoop out individual cookies, rolled them into balls and used a fork to make the markings but only smashing them slightly so that they wouldn't dry out while baking!!

Loved these cookies, only a few changes, added a pinch of salt,baking soda, and a dash of vanilla extract, to make them a little more flavorful and moist I added a 3 tbsp of organic honey, my husband ate a whole batch, didnt think I made enough and I have to make more again!

really good, you'll need an extra tall glass of milk with these :-) .... Also, I had to bake a little longer then 8 minutes, maybe between 10-13 if you want the inside done.

This is such a great recipe!  I've shared it now with family and friends - it has traveled from Southern Maryland; to Clearfield, PA; Hagerstown, MD. No one could believe there was no flour in the recipe!  Everyone adds or subtracts according to their individual tastes and it always comes out perfect!  My personal favorite additions are nuts and chocolate pieces.  Thanks Stephanie T - this is definitely a keeper!

These are great! The only thing I changed was the sugar. I used Splenda Granulated instead. Thanks!

These cookies are great! I have a horrible sweet tooth and was looking for something quick and easy using few ingredients and boy did I hit the jackpot! I used 3/4 cup of regular creamy peanut butter and about 1/4 cup of crunchy peanut butter (didn't have enough creamy). Also I cut the sugar in half using 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown. They were sweetened perfectly - not too sweet. Like other reviewers I found that using about 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder kept the cookies from falling apart. Thanks Stephanie for the wonderful recipe!

These were good for how simple they were, but they are not my favourite recipe. Too sweet for our tastes - I would definitely decrease the sugar next time. Fast to mix up though mine baked for a few minutes longer than the instructions stated. I liked them better the next day than straight from the oven.

Oh so good and easy. However, they're hard to stop eating and they're rich, so you'll regret eating too many, but as I said, it's hard to stop.

I made these for a friend who can't have flour--she loved them and so did her husband. I used chunky peanut butter. I dipped a fork in water and sugar (used raw sugar because it's rather beautiful) and did the cute crisscross across the top before putting them in the oven. They turned out great.

This was a really good recipe for gluten free. I did add 1teas vanilla,and I cooked these for 10 minutes because 8 was not enough and I rolled the dough first then flattened with a fork dipped in sugar. I used half splenda in place of the whole cup and they were delicious!!

Amazing! No one will ever believe how few ingredients there are. Every time I make them we eat them all that night.   I tried it with all Splenda and they were just not worth it. I actually threw the rest away after trying them. It really does need the white sugar.

For someone who is "baking-handicapped", I found these the best, easiest and most delicious cookies ever! I needed to bring a small plate of goodies to a coffee morning and had forgotten to buy muffin ingredients so when I found this recipe which required only 3 ingredients (plus the brown sugar, baking soda & vanilla extract as suggested by several reviewers) I thought, "How badly can I screw these up??"  Turns out not at all! They were quick & easy to make, and everyone at the party loved them. They were amazed that they are flourless... Awesome recipe, thanks Stephanie!

I have been making these with my grandmother for years. She has celiac disease so all gluten free for her. We make them with 2 eggs though. The recipe is a family fave! Especially when I put chocolate chips (about a hand-full) into the batter before I spoon out the cookies. SUPER YUMMY!! :)

This was a good recipe.  But it was not a great recipe.  I followed the suggestions of the others and used 1/2 sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.  I also added two tsp. of vanilla because I like my sweets very sweet and flavorful.  I also tried some cookies with white chocolate chips.  Those came out better.  Hubby still rated the recipe a 3 out of 5.  I will continue my quest for the best peanut butter cookie recipe.

I can't believe so few ingredients produced such a delicious cookie!  This was a quick and easy activity for me and the kiddos to do this morning.  My husband kept asking me "are you sure there are only 3 ingredients?".  I did substitute Splenda for the white sugar.  The recipe yielded 15 absolutely yummy cookies.  8 mins was the perfect cooking time for my oven.  Just chewy enough without being gooey, but not crispy and crumbly.  I know they're gonna be gone tomorrow and I'll be making more for sure.  Maybe I'll try crunchy PB the next time I get it in the house.

I can't believe how delicious these were! As a typical college student who usually has a bare pantry, these were absolutely perfect for me and my room mate to make on a lazy Friday night. I only had Skippy Natural peanut butter so I was a little worried about how they would taste, so I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract. Next time I would use regular peanut butter but I'm sure they taste great any way. They were superb. Thank you! :)

They turned out perfectly ONLY when I made them as small as the recipe called for and did the little fork design thing. So do that, and you have a 5 star cookie on your hands!

Great for GF diet, so easy, so quick, few ingredients and delicious.  I baked them for additional 2 minutes to get crispy edges.  The key is small teaspoonfuls, they seem small but you understand why when you eat them.  Yummy.

These cookies taste awesome. You won't miss the flour. Be sure to flatten the dough well with a fork before baking them. The dough tends to be firm and they don't melt down much when they bake.

I must admit, I was a little bit skeptical about the no flour thing.  That's why I had to try them.  These are fantastic!  I did 1/2 and 1/2 on white and brown sugar along with a teaspoon or so on vanilla.  I might have to try with a sugar substitute next time, and there WILL be a next time. I put them in the fridge while we had dinner, then baked smaller cookies for 13 to 14 minutes at 325.  I got around 30 cookies.

I've made several peanut butter cookies in the past but never got as many rave reviews as when I made these. Who would have thought that something so simple could be so yummy! I do add a tsp of vanilla, but have forgot it in the past and they are still delicious!

I use this almost exact same recipe for cookies but I got it off of the peanut butter container. The only difference is that it is only 1/2 cup of sugar not one cup and I perfer it with less sugar.

Fantastic! I'm on a gluten-free, dairy-free diet, and these cookies fit the bill. Delicious and easy to make - highly addictive, though. Consider yourself warned!

So good!  You can't get much better than a moist, flavorful cookie like this.  Like everyone else, I added vanilla and double the recipe.  I also put a hershy kiss in the middle of a few!  So simple, so good. True peanut butter love!

Added 3 tablespoones of Oat Bran. Rolled them in little balls then pressed with fork dipped in sugar & sprinkled with remaining  sugar. Came out great. The milk (almond, in my case) is definitely needed!

Great gluten free staple cookie!  I love these plain or with chocolate chips.  I added a pinch of salt to mine to make em less sweet.  It's hard to believe these only have 3 ingredients to them because they have such great body.  Oooh, next time I want to use chunky PB....

very good!!  sooo easy and gooey.  kids loved them and even put Hershey kisses on some of them.  i used "white chocolate wonderful" peanut butter and per the other reviews 1/4 cup light brown sugar/ 1/2 cup white sugar mixture.   i think my cookies were larger than a teaspoon b/c i had to cook them 10 minutes and they still could have used more time in the oven, but instead we ate them! YUM!

these were the best peanut butter cookies I have ever had, I was surprised to like them since they don't use flour.  I def agree you will need milk to help wash them down.  Will make again and again :)

I'm low-carbing so I used no-sugar added peanut butter, 1 tsp of vanilla and 1 1/3 c of Splenda. I baked them for about 10 minutes then let them cool for a few more. These cookies were just the thing to help me get my "pseudo sugar fix!" They're packed with peanut butter flavor and not overly sweet.

I used to make these all the time and followed the recipe exactly. The resulting cookie was very tasty but a bit crumbly and sandy. I recently tried again and used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar, and a little bit of vanilla extract. It resulted in a chewier, less fragile cookie. I also always use a little more than a cup of peanut butter, usually about a cup and 1/4, and I prefer to use chunky peanut butter! Cookie is also good with chocolate chips mixed in or jam on top.

LOVE LOVE these cookies. 1) because they taste better than most PB cookies i've had and 2) they are SO easy and fast to bake.  I always double the recipe, use half brown sugar/half white, and add a dash of vanilla extract.

For ease and simplicity, giving these a 5.  #1) make these small - bite size.  Very delicate and fall apart easily.  Overall ranking is about a 3 1/2 to 4.  Almost too rich for me.  Should be able to get 36 bite sized ones.  Kids would probably love and great recipe for them to make.

These cookies caught my eye because they are flourless which is good for keeping the carb count low. I made these tonight by using Splenda Sugar Blend...1/2 cup of Sugar Blend is the equivalent of 1 cup of sugar.  I also added 1/2 tsp vanilla.  I rolled the dough into balls and pressed them with a fork.  It made 24 average size cookies...each with about 5.5 total grams of carbohydrates.  I cooked them 9 or 10 minutes for a crunchier cookie.  My three year old and six year old loved them!

These cookies are the bomb!!!!  Went directly by the recipe except used crunchy peanut butter.  Had to bake 4 minutes longer than specified.  If you close your eyes the taste is similar to a PayDay!!  I got 16 cookies from this recipe!!

WOW! You guys werent kidding when you said these cookies are amazing. I made 3 batches of them the other day and they're already all gone. They were so soft and peanut buttery and you really do need to eat them with milk, thats the best way. These were really fun and easy to make.

I used all natural peanut butter, I think that might have made the difference. I also took the advice of other reviews and used 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar and a splash of vanilla (I would recommend this change, it was still plenty sweet with unsweetened PB even.) I baked my cookies for twice the recommended time and they were still uncooked in the middle. Still tasty, just not very "cookie like", more like fudge almost.

Proof that simple is best!!! These were the easiest cookies. My daughter made them for Christmas eve. You have to let them rest when they come out of the oven but the are perfect. I've made peanut butter cookies before with a long list of ingredients but never again, this is our peanut butter recipe now!!!

These were delicious coming straight out of the oven (and also helped me learn that the 350 setting on my oven is really closer to 500). They were melty, rich, and flavorful. However, I'm not so impressed with them the next day. They don't store very well, and have taken on a very dry, crumbly texture. They've still got a very nice flavor, but I think I'll go with a flour recipe next time.

What a great recipe!! I did half white sugar and half brown sugar and added vanilla. You will want to double or tripe the recipe depending on how big you make the cookies. I will make these from now on!! Thank you!!

FANTASTIC!!!  I added a little less sugar and used a mix of brown and white and they turned out delicious.  I used to make PB Cookies because I don't care for them and therefore won't eat them lol!  Now I'm in trouble! Great quick and easy recipe :)

This recipe was too simple not to try, and I'm glad I did. The family all agreed these were the best peanut butter cookies they'd ever had.

Wishing these would have been better. I hate to give a poor review, but if you make these with splenda in hopes for a diabetic freindly cookie, you are better of just grabbing a spoon and eating the peanut butter out of the jar. :( Sorry.

Delicious!!!  I love how thick and peanut buttery they are.  I doubled the recipe and baked the cookies for 10 min instead of 8....they still seemed a little gooey at 8 min.  I will be making these again.  So quick and easy!

Same as the recipe on the Kraft peanut butter jar except it only uses 1/2 cup sugar. I think 1 cup of sugar is too sweet. I usually use less than 1/2 cup anyways and they are great. WHO NEEDS FLOUR.

These are delicious and absolutely PERFECT for my friend with celiac's disease! Not often can one find gluten free home made baked goods that do not require a million ingredients. These are the easiest thing ever!!

I made a batch of these and a batch of store bought mix and by far these tasted 100% better. I took a hint from others and added 3/4tbs of vanilla. I will never buy store mix again! Easy to make and delicious to tatse.

First attempt - disasterous!  Second attempt - delicious!  1)  if an amateur, follow the recipe  2)  press w/ a fork before baking 3)  do a test cookie to gauge cooking time - for my oven and cookie sheet combo it took 15 min.  My first run, I put them in for 8 min. and I got globs of melted peanut butter.  I thought, what are these people thinking - I must be screwing it up.  Gave it a second run.  Wow!  Three ingredients, no fuss or mess.  My second batch held together, was cooked through, and tasted great!  W/ a scoop, I yielded 16 normal size cookies.  Now that I've got it down, this is a great basic recipe from which to build.  Vanilla and chocolate are next in line.  Again, if you tried these and they sucked, try again!  Do a test cookie first to get the time right.

super yum. my mr. loveslovesloves peanut butter cookies & these got a huge smile. the criss cross fork marks are required--well flattening them in some manner is as they do not spread on their own. also i baked for @ 12 minutes or so...8 left them too doughy.... great recipe! thanks stephanie t.

Used these for peanut blossoms and they were great.  We did reduce the sugar a little as they were going to have chocolate on them.

I have to admit, I was very excited to try this recipe...and completely disappointed in it. I read the reviews first, and tailored the recipe (as it seemed so many did successfully.) The cookies came out no less than awful. I'm sorry to say I'll have to try another recipe.

Like other reviewers, I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla. These were made for a co-worker with gluten intolerance and everyone in the office liked them. I made them bite sized using a Pampered Chef small scoop, rolled in balls and flattened with the bottom of a glass, then make an impression with the fork. Great alternative!

These are so good and everyone loves them!    When spooning out I used a heaping teaspoon amount of dough which makes for the perfect bite size cookies. I cooked for 9 minutes, let sit on pan for 2 minutes and then transfer to cooking rack.  Perfect little dessert to bring, easy to make and delicious!

Delicious, heavy cookies. I cut the sugar to 3/4 cup to cut out some of the sweetness. Next time I'll be sure to add some vanilla too. I got a dozen cookies out of the original recipe, and I'll be making them again. Thanks!

These are SO good.  I kept trying different peanut butter cookie recipes and never found one that was peanut-buttery enough until this one.  My cookies turned out very fragile and tender, but broken cookies have fewer calories, so not a drawback for me!

Super easy, super fast and super good! I followed the recipe exactly and then dipped the balls in sugar and pressed them with a fork. Hubby mentioned peanut butter cookies and after I found this recipe he had cookies in his hand about 20 min. later! A single batch made 18 cookies which is plenty for two to share! I love that there are only 3 ingredients.....what a bargain.

Definitely a tasty and easy treat!  Although I would recommend flattening them before baking.  I didn't flatten them because I assumed they would spread out enough to cook through, which they didn't.  As a result, the outside was done while the middle was undercooked.  Another good idea is to press a Hershey kiss into the middle of each cookie after they come out of the oven and before they cool!

Was a little hesitant making these cookies as I've always used flour. Instead of using 1 c white sugar, I used 1/4 c white sugar and 1/2 c brown sugar. Not sure how much the 'dough' would spread so used 3/4 teaspoonful and ended up making 25 cookies. Baked 11 minutes, not 8. Let them cool about 20-30 minutes and tested one. It was way too soft so I put one of three pans in the frig, leaving other two on counter. Waited about 1-1/2 hours. Counter cookies were firmer than frigerated ones. Wrapped firm and refrigerated cookies in separate pieces of wax paper then stored in zipper-lock storage bags. If Mom likes them in the morning, I'll make another batch. When I do, I will: 1) sub white sugar for Apriva or Splenda sugar, as cookies were a bit too sweet for my taste; and, 2) press cookies down with a fork, cross-hatching as shown in the picture. (When I copy a recipe without picture into an MS Word file, I follow directions in the recipe. There was no mention about pressing dough with fork, so will write it on my sheet.)

By far the best peanut butter cookie we have made! My daughter follows a gluten-free diet, so these were perfect for her (and the rest of the family!) We used 1/2C sugar, 1/4C brown sugar, and 1 tsp. vanilla. Seriously so delicious, you must double or triple this recipe!

These were a huge hit, and I absolutely love how easy they are to make. I doubled the recipe and used all natural peanut butter, which gave the cookies an even more intense peanut flavor. I'll be making these regularly.

I use those Air Bake cookie sheets and found that I had to double my baking time. I also added 1/3 cup of chocolate chips to appease my pregnant taste buds. Peanut butter + Chocolate = GOODNESS :)

These were pleasant enough tasting, but very, very sweet and I only managed to salvage half the batch as they all fell apart. I had high hopes for this recipe as I love peanut cookies, but I won't be bothering with them again - I'll find a different recipe. :(

My kids and I love these. They are so easy to make, and have a great soft peanut butter cookie taste. I added just a dash of vanilla extract and it made them take even better.

These were okay. Maybe I did something wrong. I did double the batch, but I wasn't really digging these. They were super easy and I really appreciate that. Just an okay cookie, in my opinion.

This recipe rocks!  My 2 year old son is allergic to wheat and we haven't introduced nuts yet...so, I used this recipe and substituted soy butter for peanut butter.  You can't tell the difference.  Although, they are a little on the sweet side!

What could possibly not be fabulous about eating straight peanut butter??? My guests and I loved them! I wanted to take the advice of the white and brown sugar measurements but I forgot and made as is (adding vanilla and using crunchy PB). They baked a good 15-16 minutes!! I mushed some up in chocolate sorbet for that this-is-so-sweet-I-want-to-throw-up deliciousness. Mmmm...

This is my favorite cookie recipe! Used 1/4c white and 3/4c brown sugar, splash of vanilla, and then doubled. Absolute perfection!!! Will never go back to any other PB cookie recipe.

Mine looked nothing like the photo. I used 1/2 c brown sugar + 1/4 c white sugar as another reviewer suggested. Mine came out very crumbly and tasted terrible--overly sweet. I threw them out. The recipe doesn't say what a "serving" is. For me, it was 2 cookies (it made 12) that started out slightly smaller than golf ball size. I not only needed milk after eating a cookie, but I needed to brush and floss. Waste of time and ingredients.

Very cool idea. These are very easy to make. I gave it two stars because these cookies don't really hold together as well as other cookies. Although they can stay together when you pick them up, they break apart too easily. The taste of peanut butter is also too potent. I know-- no duh, right? I just think there should be more of a balance. For my second batch, I had 3/4 of a cup of dough left, so I added about 1/4 cup flour and 1/8 teaspoon baking soda then molded that all together. After baking and cooling, the cookies held together much better and melted in my mouth.

When I saw the recipe, I was skeptical. But I read the reviews and decided to give it a try since I wouldn't be out very many groceries if the recipe didn't turn out well. I just made them and they are still warm on the cooling rack and they are disappearing like you wouldn't believe! These cookies are AWESOME. I didn't differentiate from the original recipe at all. I AM however, going to mix a double batch here in a few minutes so that we have extras on hand. I don't think that they are going to last long.

If you want true, pure, melt in your mouth peanut butter goodness - this is it.  Warning:  Have plenty of milk on hand - it's the perfect match.  Good with coffee or tea, too.  Just try it - you won't miss the flour and you will thoroughly enjoy this cookie!

I made these cookies on a whim since I had all the ingredients. They are super easy and very peanut-buttery. Almost a sugar overload. I let my kids eat only one each since they had so much sugar. My hubby came home later that night and ate six of them in one sitting though!

Very tasty, and I really like the texture.  I made the double batch, and I am glad I did!  I think next time I will try implementing some of the other reviewers suggestions (replacing some sugar with brown sugar, add a little vanilla, etc). I can't wait for the kids to get home and give these a taste!

really good and very rich! I would make smaller cookies next time and maybe add a little salt. A little sandy in texture, maybe I baked them too long, but before that they seemed too gooey. I will have to play with times.

What a great recipe!  My gluten free friend will love this!   I made these for an open house so I rolled them small.  The finished cookie is bite size at about an inch wide.  The recipe made about forty cookies rolled that way.  I also did the suggest 1/2 and 1/4 sugars.

This recipe calls for 1 cup peanut butter. Let me specify that you need to use 1 cup natural (no sugar added), SALTED peanut butter. The first time I made these they were sweet, sweet, sweet and bland, bland, bland. My first comment was, "These need salt!" Then I noticed that I'd used unsalted peanut butter. Oops. I have to wonder whether those reviews that say the recipe produces a tasteless cookie were written by bakers who'd also used unsalted PB. Salted, natural PB produces a VASTLY superior cookie, even with all that sugar. The salt is needed to balance the sweetness.  You can get away with reducing the sugar somewhat, but then the edges won't get as crispy-chewy. Also, in my oven, which is a bit slow, 12 minutes at 350 produced the desired crispy-chewy texture.  I used a small cookie scoop and got 24 2-inch cookies from the recipe.  It's a bit disturbing to know that for every 2 cookies you eat, one is pure peanut butter and the other pure sugar, but hey, at least you're getting some protein.

I can't say that I was happy with the turn out of these cookies, but I really was excited to make them. I doubled the recipe (2 cups sugar, 2 cups peanut butter, and 2 eggs). For the first batch, I pressed them with forks and when I pulled them out, they had flatened completely and were still gooey after 15 min. For the second batch, I put them in a mini cupcake pan and that seemed to help. Both batches may not look great, but they look edible. I did try them and I have to say that there is way too much sugar in them...to the point that I feel like I'm just eating a spoonful of sugar. I want to try this recipe again, but will definately cut the sugar in half and beat the eggs and sugar together first. I do live in Colorado, so the altitude, minus flour, may have given me a bit of trouble.

This recipe is proof that you do NOT need flour to make a delicious cookie!  I made them for the first time today, using 1/2 c white, 1/2 c brown sugar, and a tsp vanilla.  I Baked them in the toaster oven and was able to make 40 bite-sized cookies! They absolutely melt in your mouth.

I just had to try these, and the first time I made them I used half c. white and a half c. brown sugar, came out great. The second time I did the same with the sugar, but doubled the recipe and added a pkg. of chocolate chips, EVEN BETTER!! They held together fine. I flatten mine with a sugared glass. Peanut butter and chocolate yumm!  Next time I want to try adding the vanilla. Like most cookies don't over bake and let cool on the cookie sheet for a few minutes before removing. I really had my doubts but so glad I tried it!!  Thanks!!   :)

Not much taste at all.  I usually love most kinds of cookies, but these just weren't worth the time.  Even my daughter who LOVES peanut butter cookies didn't like these.

As I was making these cookies I thought how EASY it was!  They came out falling apart, didn't look right and I could not figure out what all the hype was about.  Then I realized....I forgot the egg!  Will try again...

I haven't baked these in quite awgule because I somehow lost my recipe, but can attest to the fact that they are so utterly easy and delicious.  I used to bake these for my granddaughters and my husband and there were never many left after baking.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe!  rdavis013

I'm gluten-intolerant, and thus can't have flour.  I've made these cookies before, and they are DELISH!  And I don't feel left out of the cookie world!

This is a great recipe...truly need a big tall glass of milk with these cookies.  I took the advise and added 1 tsp of vanilla and I used the sugar blend by splenda  (1/2 cup).  You could not tell the difference.

I didn't care for these at all. I made them today and they just didn't have a good taste and weren't as good as the traditional peanut butter cookies.My family didn't like them either. They are soft but just didn't have the taste. I won't be making these again.

these are great, I've made them several times by now. they are a bit too sweet so you might want to play with the amount of sugar. texture is super soft and they are so easy and tasty.

I was very skeptical initially but got this recipe from a friend. They are delicious and very easy to make. I would recommend putting a little vanilla (1 tsp) in them and flattening them with a fork that is dusted with sugar.

Maybe I shouldn't have modified the recipe (added vanilla, splenda, and baking soda), because no one in my house liked them.  They claimed that is was like eating sand.  I'm on low carb, so for me they were better than nothing!!

Mmhm, yes, taste heaven right there. They were soft coming out of the oven, and almost overpoweringly sticky in the mouth when hot. It's best to let them cool (hold yourself back!) and wait until they've set. Then you can really enjoy them with that big glass of cold milk you were craving. Thank you!

I made these cookies for a potluck for work and the theme of the potluck was GLUTEN FREE since the employee it was for was allergic to gluten.   I was a little nervous at first because I had never made anything gluten-free and with so few ingredients. I read some of the other review about using the two different types of sugar (1/4 c white and 1/2 c brown) and the splash of vanilla and prepared them using those small alternations.   Needless to say, EVERYONE LOVED THEM. First of all, they could not believe they did not have flour in them. Second of all, they were so soft and yummy, they did not make it to the potluck. They were all gone before noon time!  Something I found out on my own was that you need to flatten the cookies once you put them on the baking sheet, otherwise they will not cook all of the way through. The batter looks too soft and gooey, but they will bake up.   Word to the wise, eat them with a TALL glass of ice cold milk :)

I baked there cuz my boyfriend was craving peanut butter cookies. I  followed the advice to replace white sugar with half white sugar and 1/4 brown sugar and added a splash of vanilla extract. I also used crunchy peanut butter and made them bigger(6 cookies on 1 cookie sheet), therefore had to bake them for 10 minutes. My boyfriend said they were the best peanut butter cookies he's ever had, and they were even better than his grandmother's!
This recipe really doesn't make that many cookies tho, I multiplied the recipe by 4 times, and got 24 big cookies, so make sure you at least double the recipe so you don't end up with 6 cookies... Good Luck!

My husband and I thought they were good. I didn't have any burning, but they were pretty hard after they cooled off. They remind me of peanut brittle almost. I didn't think they were crumbly, too sweet or not enough peanut butter. They are quite good with nutella on top and when you leave them out overnight. They are chewy the next day. Yum.

I made these as a filler for the Cake Mix Cookies VIII recipe as well as a peanut butter cookie to stand alone. And they are very good either way, let me tell you! When I make these by themselves I add about 3/4 cup of chocolate chips to the cookie dough. Double the yummmm! Great, quick and easy recipe!

These were pretty good. I'm doing a no flour, no sugar diet so I used Splenda instead of sugar. Not amazing but good for a diet that normally doesn't allow cookies. They were easy and quick to make and satisfied my craving!

I made these as suggested and with changes. I really thought both tasted delicious, especially given the ease of making them and the few ingredients involved. I did like adding the tsp. of vanilla. I also did half the sugar as brown and thought that was yummy. I chilled the dough before making (make them on the small side and flatten as suggested) and chilled in between batches. I had to bake mine 10 minutes and then definitely **(KEY IMO) let them sit on the pan or stone for a while before trying to remove them. Even then they are a bit fragile to me, but they will harden up on a cooling rack to a more firm consistency.

These are great JUST the way they are. I think if you're going to add all kinds of other stuff you might as well use another recipe. The simplicity of this recipe is what makes it so great. These don't make a lot if you use the 1 cup pb, 1 egg, 1 cup sugar measurements. I think that they are so sweet so I make mini cookies instead of huge cookies. I just bump the cooking time down to about 6-7 minutes. Just watch them. Very yummy!

Love, Love, Love these cookies!!! I love the texture, they taste like the inside of a Reeses peanut butter cup. Easy to make and a big hit. They do crumble so I suggest making them so small you can pop the whole thing in your mouth at once. Try them what have you got to loose? A cup of peanut butter? Just make them if you don't dig em I bet someone you work with will.....

Pretty good for hardly no ingredients.  This is not a sub. for regular pb cookies. These were too grainy with all that sugar. Way to sweet.  These came out soft and gooey.  I cooked them a couple of min. longer cause they looked doughy.  They are good tho. I do love how small this recipe is. It makes testing out cookies much better. Im not sure if the sugar helps hold the cookies together or not, but Im definitly going to make these with considerably less sugar next time.

I love this recipe! If you ask anyone that knows me they would tell you I can't bake; but I can do this one. I added a couple of things 1/3c. of flour and 1/2tsp. vanilla then I chilled it for 15min. and then baked for 8 min. and everyone came out perfect. If you don't love this recipe your crazy. This will be in my family for years thanks so much.

Maybe these cookies will be better with regular sugar.  I have never subbed Splenda before and thought I would give it a whirl.  NEVER AGAIN.  I realize that some people need to use Splenda for dietary reasons, but I won't use it ever again.  (And I bake sveral times a week; small baking business).  Maybe I will try this recipe again.  Like the concept of flourless p.b. cookie.

I made these cookies using peanut butter, Spenda, vanilla extract,  and egg whites.  These ingredients produced a decent tasting peanut butter cookie that was a bit crumbly.  Great alternative for diabetics since each cookie has about 4 net carbs.

Great, easy recipe! This is one to keep on hand to use when you have unexpected company come over. These are quick and sooo delicious! The only change I made was adding 1 tsp vanilla.

Honestly, I tend to not like peanut butter. I only made them because my husband loves it. But these are so good! Extremely rich. Will definitely make again.

These turned out great - I took the advice of other reviewers using 1/4 c sugar and 1/2 c brown sugar, 1 t vanilla, 1/2 t baking soda. Very good. I doubled the recipe and it worked out to be about 2 dozen - which was 3 points each on Weight Watchers.

I wish I tried the original recipe first but instead I did 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar and vanilla extract.  I found the cookies too sweet and not very peanut buttery.  I'm giving 4 stars b/c I think the original recipe would have satisfied me.

These are the best peanut butter cookies out there. But, as many people do, I do have some alterations I make to them: I add a 1/2 tsp. of baking soda, and also I add 1-2 tablespoons of brown sugar. What this does is make them rise higher (the baking soda) and make them CHEWIER (the brown sugar). I have also tried making them chocolate peanut butter cookies: add 2 teaspoons of cocoa powder and 1 1/2 teaspoons of ground coffee. It tastes divine. Just the right amount of chocolate and coffee. All in all, better than all peanut butter cookie recipes I've tried. I tried one with flour and more eggs and extra everything--totally unnecessary. Totally took away from the pure peanut buttery-ness of the cookie.

I have to say that I love these cookies.  My Dear Husband is a peanut butter fanatic so he likes to have them a lot.  This is the perfect amount for our family to finish without feeling guilty for eating all the cookies :)  I did add a bit of vanilla, but other than that used only the 3 ingredients listed.  I didn't roll them into balls as the dough looked too sticky, so I spooned them out like you would chocolate chip cookies and pushed them down with a fork and they were rustic and very pretty and extremely delicious.  I may try making them with Splenda next time for my mom who is a diabetic.

I was craving peanut butter cookies so i decided to try these. Not the best, but they would work in a pinch or for a gluten-free diet. I followed someone else's advice and used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I also added a dash of vanilla and a teaspoon of baking powder. I found that they baked well but were too grainy from the sugar.

A family favorite! Loved by me, husband, and baby-in-utero, who throughout the first trimester has rejected (or maybe it's just my testy stomach) just about every decent way of getting protein, until I finally discovered this as a way to get myself to eat peanut butter again! These are addictive, and so easy to whip up!

I enjoyed this recipe as I needed a celiac-friendly cookie!  I took the advice of another reader and added vanilla and baking powder to them.  I had tripled the recipe so for sugar I split the amount equally with brown sugar, white sugar and icing sugar so they would not be so granular as another reader had mentioned.  I also put some butterscotch chips in to make them interesting.  Turned out great!

Fast and delicious. I doubled the recipe and made a dozen on the forst pan and 13 on the second. The first pan I cooked for 15 minutes as others had suggested but they were still not quite done. The second pan I cooked for 18 minutes (this batch showed a few small cracks ) and they were perfect. A little gritty using granulated sugar but still great.

I changed the ingredients to the following: 1 c. peanut butter, 1/2 c. granulated sugar, 1/4 c. brown sugar, 1 egg, 1 t. vanilla. I definitely recommend making a double batch--these go quickly! We loved this so much I shared it with a friend.

very good and sure they can't come easier to prepare: you need literally 2 minutes to throw them into the oven, and 8 to bake. You'll have cookies ready in ten minutes! but the taste is quite satisfying!

These cookies were ok. I cooked for 8 minutes and they were not done. I cooked the second batch for 15-20 minutes and the were perfect. I guess for only three ingredients the recipe works.

Quick and easy recipe! I have made this as the recipe calls and it is perfect. I have also tried adding a little bit of vanilla extract, or sometimes half white sugar and half brown sugar instead of all white. I bake these for the minimal amount of time, and I let them cool for 5 min or so on the cookie sheet before removing them with a spatula, otherwise they will be too crubbly and fall apart. As they cool they firm up.

Wow, I had no idea what to expect with these but they were great!  I used half peanut butter and half almond butter, and followed another reviewers recommendation to add just a few tablespoons of flour.  Will definitely be making these again soon!

I absolutely love peanut butter and these are so easy and are very peanut buttery! They are crumbly, so make sure you have a plate undernearth!I think that i may have to stick with the original peanut butter cookies and use flour, though.   As suggested by others i added a tsp of vanilla and used 1/2C of splenda and 1/4C of brown sugar instead. For half of the cookies, i rolled them in regular sugar and added chocolate kisses once i took them out of the oven. I also was able to get 17, what seemed to me like regular sized,  cookies out of the original recipe.

These are the most amazing cookies I have EVER had! Me and my best friend made these when we were bored, and never expected them to be so good. I followed the instructions precisely, but added about 1/4 cup of flour, too, like a previous poster had done. That made them easier to mold and made them more chewy. Overall, an extremely yummy recipe, but does require milk to drink with it! :D

a little too peanut buttery for me.  i think next time i'd add some flour and lessen the pb.  i put a hershey on top of mine which made it a little less peanut buttery but i think i'll try one with a little more flour.

I've made these cookies many times in the past & always like them! This time I did add some vanilla, baking soda, & a mix of low-fat PB & all natural almond butter. Really tasty!! I'm not sure why some say they don't bake in 8 minutes, let alone take 35 minutes... Mine were cooked nicely after 8 minutes.  They spread quite a bit & flatten as they cool.  You will need to leave them on the pan for about 5 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack or they'll fall apart.

These are so good- I had my doubts but they are absolutely delicious.  I used organic extra crunchy peanut butter and added two tbsp of Bisquick and 1/4 cup of whole oats.  They are quick and delightful.  I noticed another review said to cook for 35 minutes- I kind of banked on them taking longer than the 8 minutes the recipe outlines, but I burnt them a little after leaving them in for 10- but they were still good

Good cookies, although a little too sweet. My dad thought they were going to turn out awful since they had no flour. So, I added a couple of tablespoons to make him happy. I also added some vanilla extract (about 1tablespoon). Good cookies, and a really simple recipe. 4*'s!

My family are huge peanut butter fans.  This recipe was perfect.  They are so rich and has all the peanut butter taste that I want from a cookie.  Other recipes do not taste enough like peanut butter.  Goes best with a HUGE glass of milk.

Appearancewise these were a total disaster for me.  These cookies look the same going into the oven as they do 8 minutes later, so be sure you spoon them out pretty.  Also, let them cool a bit before you try to take them off the cookie sheet or they will crumble to bits.  I ended up with almost 2 dozen cookies.  The first dozen was exactly as written, the second dozen I stirred in some chocolate chunks and chopped pecans which was absolutely divine.

Awesome cookies!  I was so shocked, but with so few ingredients these were too easy to pass up.  Next time, I think I will cook a tad longer and maybe add a splash of vanilla.

I used 2 cups natural peanut butter, 2 eggs, 1 teaspoon vanilla, 1 cup sugar & 1/2 cup brown sugar.  I used a tablespoon to measure them out onto the baking sheet, which made about 36 cookies.  They baked for 8 minutes.  I pressed chocolate kisses into them when they came out of the oven.  These are absolute heaven, completely addictive & will surely be a lifetime favorite as they are unbeatably simple!

It's actually a six-star recipe....this is amazing!  Finally a cookie that tastes like peanut butter.  No matter if I make the cookies or someone else does, I always felt they were lacking in flavor, so when I tasted these, I was blown away.  Everyone who has them can't help but love them and when I tell them how easy it is, they're amazed.  I amended the recipe and substituted brown sugar for white in a 1:1 ratio and added some vanilla.  Out of eggs one day, I added ground flax seed and they were still great, although with a less sugary taste (figure that one out); they had a more natural flavor that was very nutty.  I measure out 1 T of dough and flatten it between my palms....bakes perfectly at 325 degrees F in 9 minutes.  Also, add small chunks of Ghirardelli white chocolate to the top.....delish!

These cookies were yummy, but they spread out so much that they formed one giant cookie on my tray, and trust me, they weren't placed that close together. So while it was yummy, I prefer my cookies to have a little more firmness and texture. Would probably not make these again.

Best. Recipe. Ever.  Simple, delicious, and easy to crank out huge batches.  My friends request them for our parties all the time, and it's great because one friend is lactose-intolerant and another has problems with wheat gluten.  No worries at all with this recipe!

These didnt have enough structure for me. I added 1/2 tsp baking soda as another reviewer did, and baked an extra 4 mins. They puffed in the oven, then deflated, then, because they were so thin, I couldnt get them up off the pan without them crumbling.  The flavor is also too sweet here.

I've never made peanut butter cookies in my life because I was afraid of them coming out too hard. I love the  simplicity of this recipe, though  I did add  the vanilla and brown sugar. They came out so soft, tasting just like peanut butter fudge! My kids love them. We'll see tomorrow how women's group likes them:)

I make these cookies all the time and have shared the recipe. One thing I'm puzzled about though is the "six serving" designation. If I make this recipe into "dainty" cookies it comes out to about 2 1/2 doz cookies - if I'm more generous (reality sized) it lowers it to about 2 doz. I also bake them for about 14 minutes. Guess it really doesn't matter because these are so easy and quick to make nobody is going to complain about extra work in making another batch.

I added 1/4 c oatmeal, instead of the sugar, I added 1 1/4 c splenda, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  They were great.  Will make this again and again.

Everyone loves these cookies, they're a standard in my christmas boxes.  I add a peanut butter kiss or a mini reeses peanut butter cup when they're just about finished baking.

GREAT RECIPE :)  I just saw this recipe this evening & tried it immediately.  It took me less than 45 minutes to make, bake, & clean up.  As some of the other reviewers suggested I used 1/2 white & 1/2 brown sugar and added 1/2 teaspoon vanilla.  I used the teaspoon to measure the dough and then rolled the dough in a ball then flattened slightly with a fork dipped in sugar.  The recipe yielded 24 cookies about 3 inches diameter.  I also added a chocolate chip on the top of a couple of them while they were still hot just for fun.  Delicious!!!!  This is my first gluten-free recipe for cookies and I will continue to make it many times I am sure.  Thank you!  :)

My daughter and I just made these for an afternoon snack...YUM!!  We usually don't get peanut butter cookies, but I had the ingredients and it didn't make a big mess or take a long time, so I thought why not?  So glad we did.  These are very rich...my daughter went through two glasses of milk with one cookie.  Also, my batch made a dozen big cookies and I followed the recipe measurements.

I've been making this recipe since I was a kid. I put the mixture in the fridge for 30 minutes and then roll into balls, dip in sugar and then bake. Let them cool for a few minutes and put a kiss in the middle. On my cookie tray for Christmas every year - everyone LOVES them!

i can't decide how i feel about these cookies...the taste is lovely, but i'm unsure about the texture: they're a bit crumbly...but, hey, they're flourless, essentially  sugarless (i used Splenda), and are disgracefully easy to make...i'll be using this recipe many more times!

yum! i followed someone another reviewers advice and relpaced the cup of white sugar with 1/4 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugar and added a teaspoon of vanila.  i also used extra crunchy peanut butter. i made mine a little larger than teaspoon size, so they took  lil longer than 8 minutes. these were super easy to make!

The biggest issue with these cookies is that they get all eaten before they have time to even cool down!
Our family Loves these!!

These are amazing!!!! The first time I made these I thought they were too soft and mushy but,the second time I made them my genius older sister was there and explained to me that since they are peanut butter based, you HAVE to let them cool for teh reccomended time. And also if you like an even firmer cookie add a couple tablespoons flour.

Hmmm, I'm undecided. It's amazing that it actually works (although I had to leave them in the oven for 25 minutes total). The taste is good, but  I still prefer the texture of classic flour peanut butter cookies. I'll give it another shot with creamy PB since I used crunchy this time.

These cookies are the best I have ever made.  I like to cook, but baking cookies....I never was good at it.  They always tasted too "flour-y".  I thought I would give this a try since it does away with the flour.  Worked beautifully.  I did take the advice of some others and added some brown sugar to the mix.
The only problem was that it took longer to bake than the recipe called for.  I think it was more like 14 minutes.  Now that I know that, we'll have awesome peanut butter cookies often!  My boyfriend LOVED them.  
Thanks for the great recipe!

These are the best pb cookies we've ever had.  They were the first solo baking project for my 8 year old daughter.  She did not alter the recipe.  She put her fork in Splenda to get the criss cross.  Baked on parchment. Let the cookies cool a minute on the sheet before removing to rack.  They aren't quite so fragile then.

These were great, so easy!  I followed what other reviews said & used 1/2 c sugar & 1/4 brown sugar with a little vanilla & baking soda.  First batch were gone before I knew it, so I made 2 more batches.  They go quick!  Thanks for the great recipe, This is for sure a keeper!

These were wonderful!! Even though I felt a little like I was betraying the simplicity of the recipe, I followed other reviewers' advice and used 1/4 c brown sugar and 1/2 c white sugar and also added a dash of vanilla. These are to die for! It made approximately 30 bite-sized cookies.

10/1/08~My hubby is diabetic, so I made these with Splenda & sugar-free peanut butter. Per some others' suggestions, I added a teaspoon of vanilla. It made a dozen cookies - hubby said they are great! 10/24/08~My 2nd review. Threw in a handful of chocolate chips this time, along with the added vanilla. VERY good!

i used chunky peanut butter. the 1st batch was chewy half baked taste, which my husband likes. the 2nd batch I pressed down with a fork to make flat ( before baking) and I baked for 10 minutes, came out nice and done. the amount of sugar not good at all. i will definately baked these for a christmas party.

Wow. Well, these are tasty, but the recipe VASTLY underestimates how many it makes. I was baking for my job in a cafe and wanted 24 servings rather than 6, so I quadrupled the recipe - used 4 c pb, 4 c sugar, 4 eggs, and 4 tsp vanilla - and because "rounded teaspoons" seemed way too tiny to me, I used rounded *tablespoonfuls.* I expected that it would make the suggested yield of four dozen (or 24 servings) in this case, or less because I used tablespoons instead of teaspoons, but you know what? It made SEVEN (count 'em, 7!) dozen cookies! The extras might have been nice if I'd just made one batch at home or something, but it was a total pain to scoop, roll, and fork down seven dozen cookies. So just know that even if you make bigger cookies than the recipe suggests, expect more than it says to expect!!

These cookies are great!  My son is on a gluten free casein free diet and so I've been finding alternative goodies. These don't taste like I'm trying to pass something off on him. :)

I used smuckers all natural peanut butter for about 1/3 of it, then used cashew macadamia nut butter from Trader Joe's for the rest.  I thought they were great.  Not too sweet.  I was careful not to overcook them.  I may add vanilla next time.

Thanks for a great cookie for my son!

I wanted a recipe that was different for an event at work and thought I'd give this a try. While they don't taste bad, they are indeed very heavy and you need a lot of milk to wash them down with. I gave them 3 stars because without flour they just fall apart and are a crumbly mess. There is no way I could take these to work and I have to make something else because they are too messy.

These were so easy to make.  I also added a little vanilla and doubled the recipe like some others.  My friends all loved them. Great easy recipe.

I enjoyed these cookies.  You really can't beat a recipe with only three ingredients.  I did add 1/2 tsp. of vanilla extract as a previous poster suggested.  My in-laws LOVED them, one aunt said they were the best peanut butter cookies she'd ever had.  My husband thought they were "grainy".  I enjoyed them and thought they were SO easy.

I am on a low carb diet and deperately needed the mouth feel of a sweet chewy cookie, so I had very high hopes for these. So high, in fact, that I doubled the recipe. 2 cups peanut butter, 1 cup Splenda, 2 eggs and 1 tsp vanilla. I did not care for these. They are  grainy and crumbly, without a  crisp outer shell or inner chewiness. The Splenda applied when they were flattened with a fork gave them an off taste. I actually saw the cookies 'frying' in the oven from the melted pb fat. I'll eat most anything, but not these!

I thought these tasted like sugar.  I ended up throwing the cookies away.  Nobody would eat them.  Not a cookie for us.

These were okay, as a few others reviewers have said I too think I prefer the kind with flour better.  Not the best but good for when you're in a pinch.

No fail cookie! I made a double batch, added chocolate chips, and 1/2 cup quick cook oats (added a nice crispy texture throughout cookie). First batch I overcooked a bit, and they were still great!

You cannot get any better than these! If you want true peanut butter flavor, these are the best cookies! They are incredibly easy to make and are great with some chocolate chips! My favorite peanut butter cookies, people are always so amazed when I tell them that this recipe has no flour! I would never make any other PB cookie recipe.

I was going to rate these lower at first since they are so thick and dry in your mouth....but I couldn't stop eating them anyway!! So they are very addicting, even if they don't taste the greatest!

These are the very best peanut butter cookies! Make a double batch and you will not regret it. I have made these many times and believe me...they never last long. I add a little vanilla extract but that is the only change I make.

i tried this, and the cookies flattened out and cooked like burnt cookies on the outside, and mushy peanut butter on the inside. i added flour to thicken it up, and a little extra sugar... same thing happened again. i like the idea that they're lower carb, although adding flour doesn't bother me. any ideas how to make them stay solid and cook properly??

Yum!  I doubled this recipe and made it with my class today for a girl with celiac disease.  We shaped it into a big cookie cake and stirred in chocolate chips then "iced" with whip topping.  Very rich and delicious...will keep this in my file!

I got this last year when everyone in the class had to cook something. Everyone liked them, obviously. When I made them at home, my brother ATE THEM ALL just as soon as I set them to cool. Seriously, he ate all of them in less than an hour. lol THESE ROCK!!!!!

I had exactly enough peanut butter in my pantry for this recipe, and quite the craving.  I was really skeptical of this recipe, but they turned out wonderfully.  Better the next day!

I also added 1/2 t. baking soda and 1 t. vanilla and half brown sugar.
I baked them at 325 degrees *convection* for about 13-14 minutes; maybe because I use the silicone cookie-sheet liners the cookies remained light on the bottom. I was looking for an easy, non-rolled peanut butter cookie, and these are it. I didn't make the criss-cross on top since the dough is too wet.

I used Jif creamy peanut butter since I have tried other PB cookie recipes with natural PB and it just doesn't work! I really think there's too much oil in the natural stuff for use in regular recipes.

These were pretty good !
I agree with some that they are a little on the grainy side but they do have a really nice peanut butter taste. Everyone in my house has tried them and they all seem to like them. Almost half of the cookies are already gone and I just baked them this morning.

We have friends who cannot eat gluten and I was looking for a recipe that I could make for a treat when we have them over.  This one is perfect!  I made the change of 1/2 c white sugar and 1/2 c brown sugar, added 1 tsp vanilla and a 1/2 tsp baking soda.  They are great and I think I like them even better than "regular" cookies.  Thanks!  I did extend the baking time to 10 minutes also.

Like others, my "cookies" turned out flat and oily. They spread into one another. I followed the recipe and used regular pb. I can say that the taste is wonderful...but not very easy to eat when they just fall apart when you pick them up.

Well i used this recipe using all natural chunky peanut butter and it turned out pretty flavorless. I think the only way to make this recipe is to use the standard creamy peanut butter like JIF or Reese's. It wasn't bad the way i made it, it just didn't taste very much the way a cookie should taste.

Wow- This was great!  My husband keeps asking me if there is flour in these.  The were so easy and so good!  I recommend dipping half of them in chocolate then in chopped nuts for something extra special!

This was just the recipe I was looking for! I didn't have white sugar, so I used 1/2 cup of light brown sugar. They turned out wonderful!

This recipe was so easy! :) I used gourmet peanut butter which contained cinnamon and raisins. Because that peanut butter was so sweet, I used 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe recommended. 
I had to bake the cookies longer than 8 minutes, not sure if this was due to the changes I made to the recipe. Mine baked for 13 minutes.
They were delicious. I look forward to making these again and trying it with regular peanut butter.

Great and easy recipe.  When I pulled them out I pushed dark kisses in the middle then put them in the fridge.  They made wonderful Christmas treats for my family.  They were gone fast! Thanks for sharing!

I've tried this recipe twice and both times I've been disappointed with the consistency (and to a lesser extent the flavor).  I'll stick to floured recipes.

These turned out pretty good!  I added about 1 tsp vanilla and some chocolate chips.  I baked them at 375 for 10 minutes.  Let them cool for atleast 10 minutes so they'll set.

Everyone I make these cookies for LOVES them.  I altered the recipe slightly.  I use 1/2 cup of brown sugar + 1/4 cup of white sugar & tsp of vanilla.  I also use silicon baking cups the mixture is shapeless.  I fill the cups about a quarter full and bake for 13 minutes (makes a dozen).  The end results looks like a reeses peanut butter cup and is delicious.  Putting them in baking cups is definitely key...!!!

My grandson is allergic to gluten dairy, and peanuts. I made this recipe using a combination of soy and almond butter, with 1/2c brown sugar, 1/4c sugar, and a splash of vanilla. I baked them on a stone and they were still very soft when I took them out of the oven, but firmed up as they sat on the stone. They are very yummy, I hope the grandson loves them.

These were very good but not quite great -- certainly the easiest.   I felt I had to add a little flour.  They still came out pretty thin and just a bit greasier than I prefer.  I'll probably add more flour next time.

I was skeptical of this recipe but had all the ingredients on hand and decided to give it a go. A little bit too sweet for my liking (I even reduced the sugar per some reviewers' suggestions and used natural PB) but still tasty. But there were a few problems, apart from the sweetness-- like some others, the bottoms almost burned and the cookies were really crumbly. I prefer "Favorite Peanut Butter Cookies," found on this site.

I was craving something sweet. I can't have sugar, and all I had as far as Splenda were a little bundle of packets I filtched from various coffee shops. They amounted to just under a quarter cup, so... I added a quarter cup of peanut butter and about 1/4 of a beaten egg, lol. And my two cookies were GOOD! Thank you for sharing!

UNBELIEVABLE. Absolutely the best and easiest pb cookie recipe ever. My husband is a true lover of pb cookies, and these are the best. We call them "Faith cookie", because they don't look done, because they haven't solidified very much, the pb needs to harden from the heat. Give it maybe an extra minute or two, but be careful, I burned a few batches before really perfecting it. Then let them cool for a while, and they will harden. Also, time in the fridge overnite will harden them more. Enjoy! So easy to make! And great to double the recipe. I did make a batch with chocolate chunks once, very good too. Can't say enough about this easy recipe. Try it TODAY.

wow, I just made these cookies and I'm eating one right now as I speak.  They are sooo good! I didn't use one ounce of white sugar, but instead used mostly brown sugar and a few tablespoons of sweet n low.  Make sure you mix the dough till you can barely move the spoon around so it's easier to spoon before the baking sheet.  I made 12 big PB cookies and they actually ended up forming together (oops!) next time I'll make sure to use two trays rather than one.  They are the perfect texture.  Nice and chewy and soft.  Yumm-O!

My boyfriend's 2 year old neice was recently diagnosed with Celiac Disease (she can't have wheat products). I'm making delicious peanut butter bars for our football tailgate this weekend but she can't have them because they have graham cracker crumbs in them. I was searching for an alternative to the bars, but a way for her to get a peanut butter fix and still feel included. I made these tonight and they were delicious. I think she'll be happy to eat these gluten-free treats :) Thanks a lot.

Excellent recipe.  I have made it with conventional peanut butter and natural. I prefer the natural, it gives it a wonderful peanut taste.  I use splenda in all my cooking and it still tasted wonderfully yummy!  Really quick too!  Make sure to use a large egg, a medium makes the cookie too crumbly.

AMAZING!  Super peanut buttery and easy to make!  I used all natural peanut butter so as not to have an overpowering sweetness, and they were perfect!  My husband didn't like them (he likes more of a bland flavor) but that just means more for me!

Ps...I added 1 tsp. of vanilla

These cookies were amazing.  Very heavy, and definitely need a lot of milk, but everyone in my family loved them.  I definitely suggest doubling or even tripling the recipe, because otherwise they'll disappear so fast, you might not get any!

First time I tried, I followed cooking time, but was not done.  I have an old oven, so my cooking time is 20 minutes.  

I received a lot of peanut butter after the hurricane, which was about to expire, so I tried this recipe.  I had a dozen jars of peanut butter, and I am now down to three.  GREAT, GREAT, GREAT cookies!

Thanks for sharing!

I was very disappointed with these cookies.  My hopes were high based on the descriptions from other reviews - "chewy" and "very peanut buttery".  I used all natural PB, as other reviewers recommended, and a splash of vanilla.  Unfortunately, the cookies were not soft (they weren't crunchy, but they weren't chewy) and they didn't even taste very peanut buttery (maybe regular PB would have been better?)  But my biggest complaint was that they were grainy - like I was chewing a lump of sugar.  I think I'll try a recipe with flour next time.

You seriously can not get an easier cookie.  I make this recipe using all natural PB and Splenda (sometimes splenda for baking, which is the splenda/sugar blend).  It's delicious!  I definitely bake them for a bit longer than 8 minutes.  Maybe about 12 or so?  I will definitely use this recipe at  Christmas time for the people who prefer JIF or Skippy with regular sugar.  YUMMY

I was expecting more after reading the reviews.  I used natural peanut butter, 1/2 c white sugar and 1/2 c brown sugar.  They were okay, just not great.  I won't make them again.

These are great for people with celiac disease.  They aren't the crispy original style p.b. cookie made with shortening and flour. For the people complaining they were too sugary, I would suggest using natural peanut butter where the only ingredient is peanuts,  if you use that junk like craft or jiff with extra fat and sugar already added, the recipe will turn out greasy and sweet.  These were a hit in our house.  I also suggest rolling the dough into balls with yourhands and flattening with a fork.  They held together well.  I added a few chocolate chips as well.  Very tasty!

I tried adding the vanilla and using 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar as suggested in other comments and they still were not very good.  Even baking these 12 minutes, they were overly gooey on the inside and too sweet. (I didn't think anything could be TOO sweet for my kids).  I would not make these again.

These were so easy to make and so chewy! I used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar like recommended by some reviews... rolled them into balls and very lightly pressed with a fork... baked them at 350 for 10 mins... mmm mmm good : ) My only complaint would be they're a little too sweet but that may be the peanut butter i used... I'm a "new" baker so seeing these turn out so perfectly was really exciting for me.... Thanks so much!

These were good.  Like other reviews I added some vanilla which is a must.  Omitting the flour was great for people who are trying to be a little bit healthier!

My celiac husband LOVES these.  I usually double the batch, but use half regular sugar and half brown sugar.  I smush them down a little with a fork dipped in sugar.  You have to be VERY careful not to overcook them.

I loved them! I love peanut butter so they were wonderful in taste. Also, very easy and I loved that. It took about 13 min to bake and they were perfect and did not burn. I will make them again.

These are the only peanut butter cookies I ever make! (except that I always add a little vanilla extract!) Here's a great clean up tip...spray your mixing bowl with a little Pam before using. I also use a melon baller (sprayed with Pam) to measure out perfectly round cookies that are all the same size!

I didn't care for these cookies. My kids liked them and that is the reason I am giving it a 4 star, if they didn't like them, this would be receiving a 3. The baking time was way off, I had to bake a lot longer than what the recipe called for. I thought these were a bit "sugary" tasting. I will go back to the classic recipe.

This recipe is a life saver for my 8 year old niece, just diagnosed with Celiac's disease. She can still eat cookies! I use brown sugar in this recipe for a taste I consider closer to traditional peanut butter cookies.

This is the recipe on the back of the Kraft Peanut Butter jar, I've been making these for years.  I would be able to whip them up for my husband right after dinner, and he'd be eating warm delicious cookies in a mere 10 minutes.  They are of course denser and more chewy then a cookie with flour, but it lends an almost fudgey quality.  I even sneak a couple of these and I am not a huge peanut butter fan.

We love these cookies! been using this quick recipe for over a year.I always make them bar cookies. I double it,then use my jelly roll pan.I drizzle chocolate on the after they are cool! Also I always use Chunky peanutbutter. If you don't bar them you really do have to let them cool first before taking them off the sheet.Yummy I'm going to make them now!

I'm not sure why this recipe would get any kind of bad review. We tried it tonight, and my hubby and kids ate these faster than I could pull them out of the oven. They are very, very good. This is the fastest, easiest peanut butter cookie I have ever made. You get 5 stars!

I MADE THIS RECIPE WITH ONE SMALL CHANGE, I WAS SHORT ON WHITE SUGAR SO I USED 1/2 BROWN SUGAR AND 1/2 WHITE SUGAR. THESE ARE THE BEST COOKIES EVER. MY GIRLS ADDED SOME PEANUT BUTTER HERSHEY KISSES TO THEIRS AND THEY WERE EVEN BETTER. EASY, FAST, AND YUMMY!!!!!!

SERIOUSLY, besides the fact that this is such AN INCREDIBLY EASY recipe, these are THE BEST peanut butter cookies EVER.  I add Reece's peanut butter chips, which makes them EVEN MORE yummy and peanut buttery.  Every time I have served these at a holiday party or have brought them to the office, they have disappeared quicker than you can say "where's the milk?"......

If I had to pick a word to describe these cookies it would be AWESOME! I made these the first time and my husband loved them. The second time I made them I add a lil flour and they where great. Either way I made them everyone loved them.  I highly recommend these cookies. Thank You!

Just made these, added vanilla and mini semi-sweet chocalate chips. My family agrees the best peanut butter cookie recipe yet. Also I baked them for 12 min after flattening them with a fork and allowed them to cool on the sheet for 5 min.  They turned out picture perfect.

This recipe was super easy and quick.  The cookies were great.  I used crunchy peanut butter and added a little vanilla.  My cookies baked for about 10-12 minutes

Pretty good for so few ingredients. My Mom  said they tasted almost like peanut butter pralines.

I followed advice from reviews and added a tsp of vanilla, and a pinch of salt and baking soda. I also did the fork thing so they were flat (which is what I wanted).

This recipe is Awesome. I made these especially for my husband, because he loves PB cookies so much. I have never cared for any PB cookies that I have ever made, Up UNTIL NOW. I loved these. My husband took some to work with him and shared. TY for such an easy recipe. I will be making these many, many times in the future. I also added a pinch of baking soda, and salt, and about 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla..awesome flavor, plus I didnt flatten as some did, I just made small balls, about 30...

Very quick and easy recipe.  I did as some other users suggested, added some baking soda, vanilla, and a little salt.  The house smells yummy.  You will definitely need milk with this one.

I make these cookies about every other week. I substitute splenda for the sugar and add a teaspoon of vanilla. If you keep these in the freezer after baking they have more of a cookie texture. These are wonderful with a cup of coffee and practically guilt free on a low carb diet! Make sure you flatten them a little before baking.

I made these with natural peanut butter and brown sugar.  I flattened them and baked about 11 minutes.  They were absolutely delicious.  My boyfriend and I took them hiking to use as our protein/glucose source, but we ended up eating most of them at the cabin!  They stay soft and chewy if kept in an airtight container.

Who would have ever thought you could make cookies so quickly and with so little effort!  These are terrific for being so little work.  I rolled the dough into balls and flattened with a fork like regular peanut butter cookies.  They baked up perfectly in 8-9 minutes.  I made 32 cookies (two trays of 16) with one recipe of dough.  The people who had trouble getting the cookies to cook through should try again making smaller cookies.  I can't imagine how this recipe would work if you made only 12 cookies (as the recipe says)and didn't flatten them.  I will make this many times!

They were satisfactory for what they are... but hardly notable.
Might be good if you want to let your kids bake...
but it's not that hard to add a few more ingredients and the taste difference is noticable.
If you do drop by the teaspoonful, the recipe yields far more than a dozen... more like 40 (small) cookies.

Edited to add a star and the comment that despite my lack of enthusiasm, my boyfriend declared them some of the best peanut butter cookies he ever had and ate most the batch.

all i can say is THANK YOU!! i thought this was so easy even tho i had to change the recipe a bit. my son is allergic to milk soy egg and a few other things but luckly for us he loves peanut butter and can eat it. i made it like stated, but made cookies a little smaller and instead of the egg i used an egg replacer, hoping it would work, and it did!! we have a super bowl party to go to and i am incharge of desserts, wanting to make something that my son could eat made it a little harder (as well as i have been sick allweek and not gone grocery shopping) anyway,,,this is great and can be easily adapted for those who can't have egg

I made the cookies according to the recipe, and split the dough in half. To one half I added about 1tbs of cocoapowder, and the other I left plain. In the end, the choice  between eating a chocolate-peanut butter cookie and a regular peanutbutter cookie was difficult! Great recipe.

My husband loves peanut butter, and even he thought the cookie was too much like paste in his mouth. They were tasty enough to be worth experimenting with to see if the peanut butter can be "lightened up" a bit. I made this with natural peanut butter, 1/2 c. brown sugar, 1/4 c. Splenda, and 1 t. vanilla, and it was really good. Even after baking for 11 minutes the cookies remained soft and slightly crumbly.

Alright... I was extremely skeptical of this recipe.  No flour?  But, I was craving a super-easy treat, and thought I could give these a try.  WOW!  After reading some reviews, I went with the 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 granulated sugar, and then added mini m&m's. I chilled the dough while the oven was heating up, and then rolled the cookies out into one inch balls and baked for about 10 minutes.  I let them cool for at least 5 minutes on the pan before removing them, and I have to agree that they should cool completely before eating them.  Be brave, resist the urge to add flour, you really don't need to!  And- they were even better the second day.  Try them.  They're yummy- I would rate even better than regular pb cookies.

This is one of the easiest, yummiest peanut butter cookie recipies I have used.  If I didn't tell people they were flourless, I don't think anyone would know.  I made this for one of my ceiliac friends, and now she requests them all the time!  It takes me 20 minutes from start to finish, including tasting the first cookie.  I'd give this one 6 stars if I could.

This is the easiest cookie ever! I still prefer the regular cookies with flour though because I found these too be a little too peanut buttery tasting and I could detect the crunchy texture of the sugar. But if you love peanut butter you will love these. I probably could have baked them for a little bit longer because the middle didn't seem completely cooked, even after they cooled. Also, let them cool completely because otherwise they don't taste as good and will fall apart.

I have made this recipe for years.  I believe, although not 100% sure that the original recipe comes from Kraft.  However, I use less sugar (1/3 cup - 1/2 cup or sometimes use 1/2 cup Splenda) and add about 1/2 cup choc chip cookies.  These are the best!

Dreamy peanut butter cookie!  I was more than a bit skeptical because I am a fan of "traditional" flour-added peanut butter cookies.  However, I was out of a few key ingredients and my daughter wanted to bake something for her dad this evening.  I found this recipe and thought, at worst, it would be thirty minutes gone from the day.  I was so pleasantly surprised!!  We used 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup white sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla.  No flour at all.  We cooked for about nine minutes because they still seemed a bit "raw" after eight minutes (even after left standing for five minutes).  I am throwing out my old recipe!  No more blending ingredients until your shoulders hurt.....this is just too easy and the payoff was exceptional!!

I've been making these for many years! The flavor is really enhanced if you add a teaspoon of vanilla flavoring. You must let these cookies cool almost completely or they crumble.  After cooling, they will be firm enough to handle.  

Kids and grand kids love to make these.  It's easy and the mess is small.  Good luck!!!

I must say..WOW!! Mine are baking right now, but I've got into the cookie dough and it's YUMMY!! (8 minutes later)OK it took longer than 8 minutes to bake, but it was worth the wait.  YUMMINESS. I used light peanut butter instead, and the other suggestions about the sugar and vanilla.  Also I added chocolate chips. The light peanut butter took off the edge of peanutty flavour, which I find can get strong sometimes.  But I will defently be making this again (espically since it doesn't take much to make).

These cookies were great and the best part was that they were sooo easy.  I was out of shortening and baking powder and my 3 year old son was home with a broken leg.  I wanted to make his favorite...peanut butter cookies, but thought it was hopeless (it's just too much work to drag him and my 4 yr old to the store for two things).  This recipe saved me and I have to admit I was a little skeptical.  I took the others advice and reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup(1/4 cup white, 1/2 brown) and they turned out wonderful!  Thanks so for the quick, easy, and delicious cookies!!

These are very good but you must be a peanut butter fan for sure.  They are dense and rich.  We melted milk chocolate and drizzled it over the top of the cookies.

I have made these cookies for years and they have always turned out beautifully. I add chocolate chips to the dough for a nice treat.

I have been making these for many years. They are so yummy and easy to prepare. Prior to baking, roll them into balls, make a thumb print in the center, and place a hershey's kiss on it.

These cookies are wonderful, and very popular for those who love peanut butter.  I recommend you follow the simple recipe exactly, baking for exactly 8 minutes.  If you wait until they brown on top, they are overdone.  I roll each teaspoonful into a round ball with my hands before placing on the cookie sheet.  Each ball I flatten a bit with a fork, both ways, to make a criss-cross pattern with the tines.  Quick, Easy and  Delicious!

These are yummy!  They are very rich!!!  I can't eat more than 2.  I've made these with 1/2 a cup of oatmeal.  With oatmeal, they break easily, but still yummy.

These cookies are the best. Couldn't keep my boyfriend out of them, so I had to make another batch.  I used chunky peanut butter and you really do not have to add any flour or do anything special to the recipe.  Just roll dough into 1 inch balls and don't even flatten.  They spread just enough.  A KEEPER FOR SURE!

This recipe is awesome. You won't find many recipes that require very little work and NO MESS IN THE KITCHEN. No flour to clean up after. And, yes, the cookies were very good. This will be my Peanut Butter Cookie Recipe from now on. Thanks.

i added 3 tbsp flour and 1/2 tspn vanilla and baked for 12 minutes. missing something - i think maybe it needs 2 eggs. good for when your low on baking supplies and need a sweet fix. super fast and easy to make. not fabulous, just ok. very sweet.

My boyfriend and I made these cookies, but we did add 3 tablespoons of flour and did the half and half sugar thing.  He said they tasted just like Reese's peanut butter.  Our next thing is going to be to try them with chocolate chips and/or a mashed banana in the recipe!

I found this recipee to be just like eating peanut butter and 
sugar. I thought it was okay- but nothing special. These cookies were
 a little too sweet for my likings as well. Next time I would opt for 
a different recipe.

These cookies were DELICIOUS!! It would be better if you baked for 15 minutes so they wouldn't come out under baked.  I baked it for 15 minutes and they turned out so moist, yet crispy!

I used Skippy Super Chunk PB, 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1 tsp vanilla - the cookies came out with good texture. I pressed sugared fork tines in one direction on half  of the cookies, both came out similarly puffed. I cooked these at 350 for 11 minutes and they were lightly toasted. I added up the carbs and calories from the sugar and PB then divided by the 30 cookies this recipe made:  9.6 carbs and 75 calories each.

Such an easy recipe! This time I doubled the recipe, I only used 3/4 white sugar and 3/4 brown sugar because it was too sweet with all the white sugar (would have been 2 cups) and it was perfect! I also added 1 t vanilla and 1 t baking soda, just because. 
The cookie is a bit crumbly so don't flatten them.

Been making these for a few decades now, easy quick and no flour taste. For those that have a problem with the sugar, I whip the egg with the sugar and let it sit for about 10 minutes so the sugar will dissolve. No one can get enough of these!

I've made this recipe twice now, it's going into my list of desserts. Fast to mix together, fast to bake. 

The mix was too soft at first, but I found if I let it sit for a few minutes after missing, the dough firms up a little.
My cookies were 1 tablespoon of dough rolled and then pressed with a fork

I didn't love them as soft & rich as they were, a pinch of salt and a little vanilla helped the flavor, adding 2-3 minutes to the bake time and then let them cool on the pan made a slightly drier cookie, crisp and not quite soft.

Excellent cookie, even for those without food sensitivities!! But, know that if you also have someone with egg allergy, they still work great with a flax-egg (1T flax meal/ground flax, 2.5T water). I JUST did that and still amazing.  We also decided to melt some chocolate chips to dip them in.  DECADENT!!!

These are delicious!
I added a handful of oats for a little more substance, but otherwise followed the recipe. These cookies came out moist and so tasty, super easy too! They did not last in my office, they were all gone quick and nobody could believe that they were flour and dairy free. Will absolutely be making these again!

I normally enjoy a lot of peanut butter but  this recipe was too much.  When eating, you could feel the bits of sugar crunch through your teeth and it tasted like you were putting spoonfuls of peanut butter with sugar added in your mouth. While this is the case, I believe that with a few changes this recipe will be great!

These were ok.  I thought they would spread a little more in baking.  Next time and yes they were good enough to make again, I will have some melting chocolate and coconut to coat them on an edge.  Not sure why mine didn't look like the picture but they were good none the less.
I make try next time making them with nutella.

Made these last week, and they are ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!!!! I know some here fuss when you give 5 stars even after making an adjustment or two, BUT....."5 stars" indicates that "you loved it". AND I DID "LOVE" it because of it being a "no flour" cookie recipe.

I did add the vanilla and baking powder as a few others here suggested, AND.....I also ended up baking them for about 25 mins per hubby's preference. (I pulled them out after about 15 mins initially, but then after they cooled he tossed up the idea of doing a comparison with the next batch and baking them a bit longer. Between the two, we kinda preferred those that had baked longer).

But in the end will have to agree with most of the others here, that those were probably some of the BEST peanut butter cookies ever!!!!!

Terrific!  The only thing I did differently from the original was to add crunchy peanut butter.  I had a hankering for it!  I also used the last 11 of those little chocolates you get in an advent calendar --like a blossom cookie then.  I don't know why I bother with recipes needing more ingredients!

If you like peanut butter and you're looking for a quick and easy recipe, this is the one for you. 
It's very easy with only 3 ingredients (so even the kids can do it) and it tastes good. Thanks for the recipe.

Easy to make and tastes great! Used silicon pads in cookie sheets for the first time, and cookie bottoms didn't firm up well in those cookie sheets. However, in my Copper Chef cookie sheet, the cookie bottoms firmed up just fine. I might try plain old parchment paper in my other cookie sheets next time to see if the cookies set better.

I really liked the simplicity of this recipe, since I made them for Thanksgiving. I followed the directions as written and these cookies were so good with a strong peanut butter taste. I made a double batch and only filled two cookie sheets. I increased bake time to 11 minutes because they weren't baked enough.

Excellent and easy!  I like that these cookies don't have flour.  I always use Splenda and they come out well.  I've added chocolate and those, with peanut butter, are superb.  I've used cashew butter with a cashew "surprise" inside each cookie and people loved those.  And I frequently use almond butter with sliced almonds which are really good.  I always add vanilla extract and frequently I add almond extract which gives a lovely undertone.

This is the way my Great-grandma made them for me when I was a girl 50 plus years ago. Rich, super peanut buttery, and oh so good. I also like to add a teaspoon of vanilla to mine just for kicks. Enjoy!

I love these they are so easy and I had all the ingredients I needed right at home. I like to use a cookie scoop to get the same size so they always take longer. 10 to 16 minutes. This can be different every time.

I’m not usually a fan of peanut butter cookies, but this one is real good. I originally found it in a cookie cookbook for moms. It’s also a super easy recipe for beginners, my 11yo is currently making up a double batch and this will be the first time he makes cookies completely on his own, with just supervision.

I was craving something quick and sweet so thought I'd try these cookies. I used Jif Natural PB, 1/4 cup organic sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar , a dash of vanilla and of course 1 egg. These took way longer than 8 minutes to cook at 350. I tried them after 8 min, 10 min and 12 min. At least 15min and the middle never got done while the outside and bottom is burnt. You pick them up and they just crumble apart into a hundred pieces and the middle falls out of the bottom lol. Not sure how others got these to turn out for the great reviews. I will stick with flour I suppose to make an edible pb cookie.

Super dense, flavorful cookies. Not sure why anyone would want the hassle of a more complicated recipe!

I took the other suggestions and used a combination of 1/4 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugar, plus added 1 teaspoon of vanilla.

I made these tablespoon-sized, and flattened them into a crisscross pattern with a fork before baking. The larger cookies took ~16 minutes to bake (double the time in the recipe). 

Will definitely make again. Great for days when there's not a lot of ingredients in the cupboard!

I did the 1/2 c white sugar and 1/4 c dark sugar that many recommended, and it was plenty sweet for me. (I could reduce sugar even further.) I also added 1 tsp of vanilla. I bought a crunchy TJoe's brand PB specifically for this recipe. It seemed to have a lot of oil, which I thought might affect this recipe. So, I did half of that and half regular PB. It seemed kind of loose, so I added just a small amount of flour to fix that. They came out delicious and with a nice chew. I didn't do the fork-cross thing. For so few ingredients, this is a delicious cookie. Better than store stuff.

This gets 5 stars with 1/2 of the sugar. Used my cookie/melon scoop and had 13 perfectly rounded professional looking cookies. This is a keeper. (Did you 1/2 cup brown sugar rather than white and added 1 tsp vanilla.)

Awesome recipe.  After a year of having gluten sensitivity and not wanting to invest too much money experimenting with GF ingredients, this simple recipe was just the ticket. I did follow other users suggestions and did half white half brown sugar, a little vanilla and baking powder. Ten minutes in the oven and the cookies were perfect. Oh and a single batch yielded almost two dozen cookies...the perfect amount for my family.

Good! Used 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar & 1tsp vanilla as suggested. Also rolled into balls by hand and pressed with a fork before baking. Also baked on a parchment sheet. Baked 10-12 minutes. Made 2 dozen.

AS other reviews said, one cup of sugar is too much. ONE Half to 3/4 cup of sugar is good. And add salt if your pb doesn't have any. I made 6 huge cookies out of this recipe and they were way too big!! Didn't cook through, even with 3 extra minutes baking time. So resist the urge, and make smaller cookies :)

This recipe is excellent. Ready in 8 minutes. All at 350 degrees.

Ended up with about a dozen cookies.

Used crunchy peanut butter. Don't know if that made a difference or not. Might need more input from other people.

I've been making these for a few years and they are the best peanut butter cookie ever!  I make them exactly as stated in the recipe and don't see a need to change anything.  The only tip I have is to really trust that they are done at 8 minutes, but leave them on the cookie sheet for about 2 minutes before moving them to a cooling rack.  This helps them stick together better.  They get so many compliments when I bring them to gatherings.  If I happen to have chocolate chips I might put some in, but they don't need it.

I made one batch as written, and one as suggested by Nicole H.  Nicole's were definitely the best:  3/4C sugars (white and brown), vanilla, and a pinch of salt.  Also, I topped some with chocolate chips.

I liked this recipe a lot. It was very simple and  I had all the ingredients without having to go to the store. I had to cook them 2 minutes longer than it said and I made a glaze out of the peanut butter, sugar, and melted butter. I will make this recipe again.

I would definitely make this again.  So easy and delish!  I recommend flattening with a fork before popping in the oven.  Theu didn't flatten at all for me.  I used a cup of sugar.  Too much for my tatse. I will half it next time.  Great texture!

I had to tweak it a bit because I didn't have enough peanut butter & felt a little ambitious. I mixed about 3/4 cup peanut butter and about 1/4 cup of almond butter. I also used 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of white sugar and added a teaspoon of vanilla. Delicious!! Crumbly, so savor every crumb with a fork!!

My 3 year old rated these as yummy!. I used natural peanut in place of just regular. It would have cut down on the sweetness as well as making making them a tad bit "healthier". I'm not a huge fan of peanut butter cookies as I find them all too sweet. But these were made for my daughter :) she threw in a handful of chocolate chips as well.

Cookies are great, but the instructions could use a little more description. After cooking, you'll need to press down with a fork on the top of the cookies to get a good cookie shape. Otherwise they will remain lumps of (cooked) dough. I also added ribbons of melted Hersheys on top. Aside from tasting great, they help the flourless cookies retain their shape and structure after cooling.

I've been making these for a few years now. Everyone who taste them says they are great! I love how I can quickly & easily put these together. You can use creamy or chunky PB. I no longer bother with any other PB cookie recipe.

I made these yesterday for a friend's party.  I only added 1/2 tsp. of baking power (someone suggested that to help them hold together better).  Other than that, made exactly as directed.  They were awesome!  The trick to not having them fall apart is to NOT move them immediately after removing from the oven.  I left them on the baking sheet (stone, actually) for 2 minutes before moving them to the cooling rack, where they then sat for about 10 minutes.  They held together just fine using that method.  Just don't handle them while they're still hot and they won't fall apart.

How could you pass up a cookie recipe with 4 (or less) ingredients?! I had to try these and I'm glad I did. SO GOOD! I followed the recipe as instructed but used the following measurements:  

1 cup Skippy Chunky Peanut Butter 
1/2 cup Pure Cane Sugar
1 teaspoon Vanilla extract
1 egg

After dropping the cookies on a parchment lined baking sheet, I wet my fork to make the criss cross on the cookies super easy. I sprinkled sea salt on each one and baked at 350 for 13 mins. The trick is to let them sit, don't try to transfer them to a cooling rack or they will fall apart.  After about 10 minutes, i bit into the most delicious peanut butter cookie i didn't think possible without flour! They are crispy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. Mmmm!  Will definitely make these again...YUM!

I did make slight changes as recommended by some; I added vanilla and  1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar.  I was amazed at how tasteless this cookie was, especially being mostly peanut butter!  I will go back to my flour peanut butter recipe in the future.

I followed the recipe exactly. Had to bake them about 3 minutes longer. I may have made them too big. Crisp on the outside, chewy and moist on the inside. Yummy and delicious!  My friend who can't have gluten is gonna loooove these!

I've tried this recipe over and over again and the amount of time it takes to even make it an actual edible cookie is three times than what it tells you. I will be finding another three ingredient cookie... it was too goopy!

Just made these today. As I was making them, I was shocked at how much sugar the recipe called for. The end product was, indeed, far too sweet for my taste. They were also too grainy from all the sugar. I will try it again, but with less sugar (and maybe even icing sugar instead). I do enjoy how peanut buttery they are though! A few tweaks, and they will be perfect.

Best peanut butter  cookies ever!  For different flavors, I add 1/4 cup of ground almonds and 1/8 to 1/4 cup of crushed heath bar.  Watch cookies carefully if you use the heath or any toffee candy, as it may burn when it melts.

Great recipe. I doubled it and used 1 1/2 cup white sugar 1/2 cup dark brown sugar. Added 1 tsp vanilla and I tsp baking soda. Baked for 9 minutes and left them on the sheet for 1 minute.  I definitely like these WAY more than the ones with flour. They were also very quick and easy to make. Awesomeness....I will make these again FOR SURE.

I followed other users' recommendations by using 1/4 c white sugar and 1/2 c light brown sugar.  I also added a hint of vanilla, salt, and about 1/2 semi sweet chocolate chips.  I've never made a cookies like this so I was a little unsure when they came out of the oven as to whether they were done or not.  I ended up baking them for 10 minutes and they came out just perfect, not too gooey.

I make these all the time. It's incredibly easy. It always tastes good and requires little effort or time.  The only change I make is I add a bit of sea salt to the batter and garnish the cookies with it as well. It only enhances the flavor. Definitely recommend for someone with a craving or someone that wants an easy dessert or snack.

LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!! Really easy, I doubled it, and it made way more then a dozen-which was nice. Like other reviewers suggested,  I used half white and half brown sugar.  I also baked it for about 15 minutes, while the original recipe said to bake for 8. Sweet, but still rich and peanuty!! 
(btw, I’m 11)

Superb cookies!  I made these 2 ways: for me, I doubled the recipe but cut down 1/2 cup of sugar, added 1 egg, used coconut sugar, chunky pb, and added some chocolate chips. Baked for 10 minutes, probably because I used a muffin tin for some and silicon muffin cups for others.  I thought they'd be very crumbly. The extra egg helped hold them together, though they were still soft.

For my dogs, I made as is but without the sugar (well I added about 1 Tbsp coconut sugar). I baked about 12 minutes. These were a little crumbly, but I fed it to them on a food mat, and they loved it.

Perfect recipe. It does work well with natural crunchy nut butter but needs a small amount of baking soda to help. I use my spring loaded scoop and flatten slightly. You can't tell that there's no flour in it.

I was craving a peanut butter cookie and wanted one easy to make. I used 1/4 C each of white and brown sugar and added a splash of vanilla. I lined my 12" pizza pan with tinfoil and cooked more than 1/2 batch in my toaster oven. Ate 4 of them before they were cooled. I may add some flour to the next batch, but these were good without.

Like some others, I altered the recipe a bit - I used a half cup of sugar/half cup of Splenda; and I used 3 tablespoons of EggBeater instead of an egg.  

Takes about ten minutes to cook (not eight), but they're absolutely delicious when done.  

I added peanut halves on top the last time I made them.  Yum!

Easy and delicious. I used crunchy peanut butter because that's what I had on hand. Next time, I will try creamy PB instead for a smoother texture.

Taste is great, but a few adjustments need to be known before making these as I wish I had known.

1. If your peanut butter has any sweeteners in it, cut back on the sugar. For 2 cups of peanut butter (if doubling as I did, I recommend 1/2 cup of sugar or less. 

2. Don't flatten cookies. If you do insist, flatten only so that the top of the cookie is flat, but the rest of the cookie is plump and round. These cookies do spread and will be very thin if you flatten it too much which will make these cookies prone to breaking.

3. Add vanilla for better taste. For a doubled batch, I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla.

4. To prevent sticking to the fork when flattening, add sugar, or salt to the fork and proceed. 

5. Bake for 8 minutes as suggested and let cool. Don't be fooled if these cookies look a bit under cooked.  Peanut butter alone will becoming loose when heated, but at room temperature it thickens so let the cookies stand to cool off completely before enjoying or eat as you prefer.

6. Enjoy.

Love this recipe! I made a double batch as other reviews said this was a small batch. I used 1 c. creamy Jiff and 1c. honey peanut butter and it turned out amazing!  Mouth watering yumminess. Have a tall cold glass of milk handy, you'll need it.

These are surprisingly very good. I used crunchy PB. I may have to try the other advises on 1/2 sugar and 1/2 brown sugar. Either way--they are very good.

Currently in the oven, the dough tastes great and the recipe makes way more than six and I am completely fine with that! Can't wait until these come out of the oven! :)

A+ I absolutely love peanut butter cookies, and wasn't sure what to expect from a 3 ingredient cookie. It was AMAZING! My husband came home from work and had no idea it was not a labor intensive cookie with a dozen ingredients. My kids kept leaving the shower to grab another bite. Other than cooking them about 1.5 minutes longer than directed, they were a perfect, Chewey cookie!

I make these every year since I live with a celiac the one thing I want to point out to everyone 325 not 350, and let them cool completely on the cookie sheet, without the gluten in the flour to bind them they crumble easy when warm.   I've tried these with homemade peanut butter and store bought at 350 they tend to burn really easy, even without the added fat of butter or shortening.

They are really good but took way longer than 8 minutes for them to cook completely. I also made more than the 6 it said with the amount of dough from the recipe.

These were tasty, (if you like peanut butter), but super dense. In hindsight, I would do a couple of things differently. I would definitely add a tsp of vanilla and more importantly; make much smaller cookies. These would be best made to be about the size of oreo cookies. Otherwise, (IMHO), they are too dense, heavy, and filling.

I was really skeptical with trying this recipe but once i did i was really glad i tried this one, the cookies were really soft so it made me feel like they were not done but i left them in for a few more minutes so it made them a little more firm.

I have made these cookies since I was 10 years old with my mom, I am now in my 50's.But I always add a teaspoon of vanilla extract. I still make these all the time and my granddaughters are starting to make them now with me... They are the easiest cookies to make with little kids. Everyone loves them. I also put candy kisses or   peanut butter cups in them right after they come out of the oven so the kisses and peanut butter cups melt alittle. They are one of the cookies I make every year for Christmas.

LOVE these cookies! I only used 1/2 cup of sugar and I drizzled melted chocolate on the tops just like the photo. They taste like a healthier peanut butter cup.  I made half in balls and the other half with the traditional cross hatch press (note use a wet fork or it will stick!) So yummy!

The ingredients are a great foundation to add or not add to. I did half brown, half white sugar, 1 tsp of vanilla, 1/4 cup of raw apple sauce(blended apple/a tad apple cider vinegar/cinnamon), 1 Tbsp corn starch, 1/4 cup of ground up oats, 2 Tbsp of cocoa. Could probably be made with less sugar like many mention. I made bigger cookies that needed more time in the oven. I would probably make them smaller and also give them a bit of a squish with the fork next time to keep the short cook time.

I doubled the recipe and made it exactly as written. I think there was waaaaay too much sugar. Tasted too sweet. I ended up baking them a few min longer than what it said because they were a big gooey mess at 8 min. The second pan came out crumbling into a million pieces.

Ingredients I used were 1 1/4 cup chunky, all natural peanut butter, 1/4 cup packed, brown sugar, 1 large egg and a teaspoon of vanilla. Very dry and crumbly. I don't know if using chunky, peanut butter instead of smooth made a difference or if I should've added another egg or more vanilla.  Very disappointed.

These were so yummy! I was reading all the bad reviews.. I don't get it! 
 I used cane sugar, egglands best egg and Jiff smooth peanut butter, I did add a teaspoon of  vanilla extract. I lined my pan with foil used a small scoop, flattened with a fork and sprinkled the tops with a tiny bit of sugar. Perfect little cookies :)

Great recipe, based on the reviews i saw, i was  a little disappointed in that, they were a little dry and crumbly instead of gooey as i had been hoping, that could very well have been my doing though. but still delicious, and well reviewed by those that ate them!

Delicious! I used jif natural crunchy with a hint of honey peanut butter. I discovered I didn't have white sugar, so I used 3/4 cups light brown sugar. I used a measuring teaspoon to drop them on the pan and smooshed them, ending up with two pans loaded with the perfect size cookies in just a single batch. I cooked them about ten minutes, until crispy around the edges.

Too good to be true. Easy. Few, common ingredients. Made it with my 3-year old. I did substitute 1/2 cup brown and 1/4 c white sugar plus vanilla. Worked great. Chewy. Delicious!

similar recipe also included vanilla extract. and "non oil" on top natural peanut butter. I used the oil kind and added 2tbs flour to compensate. had to bake for about 13 minutes at 350 to get the crispness. excellent and easy.

I had to baked it for twice the time suggested. If I'd make this again, I'd bake it for fifteen minutes before even checking it. Once they were completely cooked, they were great. Simple and easy, everyone liked them.

Made these according to the recipe and was pleasantly surprised how good they were! Maybe my oven but they took about 15 minutes to get done. Definitely the fastest cookie recipe I have made which was part of the incentive to try it. Grandkids loved it and it certainly a great alternative to the regular cookie recipes. It's a keeper. 
I will add if you think a teaspoon is too small- try it first, they made nice size cookies about 2 ".  Great for my Gluten Free friends, will be in the Christmas goodie box :)
Thanks

I attempted to make this recipe twice and I  don't understand what I could possible be doing wrong. It's only 3 ingredients and without fail it always turns into a greasy mess. The first time I used Jiffy peanutbutter and the second time I used Skippy peanut butter and they both came out greasy. I had to use ALOT of paper towels to blot out the grease. What the hey? I just don't get it.   I tried this recipe but won't be trying it a third time.

This is a great recipe for those who can't have wheat or dairy. You can't tell that it's only 3 ingredients. We do add a tap of vanilla. One of the only desserts so far that I actually enjoy since I have been not able to eat wheat and dairy. Thank you for sharing the recipe!

I was intrigued by the simplicity of this recipe, but skeptical of the ingredients. These cookies were grainy, crunchy and overwhelmingly sweet. I had vulunteered myself to make 12 dozen cookies, and needed three types. I choose this recipe because of the simplicity and high ratings. The other two kinds of cookies I made were much more involved, making this recipe all that more appealing.  I'm truly not sure why this recipe is rated so high, unless it's primarily based on bakers, whom are acclimated to flourless tastes. This is definitely not your go-to for soft, delectable yumminess. Thanks for the submission.

For flourless peanut butter cookies, these are excellent. And so easy! Compared to regular peanut butter cookies, they are very similar. A must-try.

I tried this recipe because it looked so easy and I will not be trying it again. I used splenda instead of sugar. The cookies had a very strange texture and crumbled too much. Everyone I gave to try one had the same opinion. I ended up giving them to my dog...who loved them.

Crumbly beyond belief. They break very easily no matter how carefully you take them off the pan. Sandy texture but that's okay. Definitely need milk for this and it was worth the attempt.

My mother in law gave me this recipe over 30 years ago when DH and I were newlyweds. Traditionally with peanut butter cookies you make a cross hatch pattern with a fork but this recipe doesn't mention that. I always loved making these becasue of the simple 3 ingredients.

This was my first time making (or eating) flourless cookies. This recipe makes approximately 1 dozen medium sized cookies. They came out pretty good, but I wouldn't say they were the "best" cookies I have ever had. They were very quick and easy to make. However, it did take longer than the 8 minutes the recipes states. I too added a teaspoon of vanilla extract.

I made these for a friend who couldn't eat flour. I made them into balls and then pushed a mini peanut butter cup into the center when they came out of the oven. She was so happy to finally be able to eat some cookies! Wonderful recipe!

I won a first place ribbon for these yummy peanut butter cookies.  Try using nutella in place of peanut butter for a fun result.

I've made these many times; I got the recipe in 7th grade Home Economics class. Three Ingredient Peanut Butter Cookies on this site is the exact same recipe. I think that both recipes should state that you need to flatten these cookies with a fork. These are heavy and very peanut buttery. You can't keep them around too long, as they get hard. They are great for kids to make because they are so easy. I make a batch when we want a quick snack, and we eat them warm.

I do love the simplicy of this recipe. i've found however, that honey intead of sugar makes these chewier, and amazing. i throw in a tsp of baking soda too.  and i love that it's so versatile. you can toss in some nuts, raisins, chocolate chips... whatever!

This was by far the easiest/quickest thing I've baked, but the cookies only tasted okay - nothing spectacular but not bad either. Batter definitely makes more than 6 cookies if you're dropping teaspoon sizes like the recipe calls for. I made 6 huge cookies instead and had to bake for an extra 10 minutes or so.  I followed some reviewers comments and used 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1 tsp vanilla. I plan to make this again but with the full cup of sugar.

Hey there fellow bakers! So I decided to try these flour-less peanut butter cookies and I must say I'm pleasantly surprised! Great consistency and awesome flavour. I also followed the direction of some other reviews and used 1/4 cup sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I also added 1 tsp of vanilla extract. Make sure to watch the cookies and have them in the oven no longer the the suggested 8 mins. They can easily burn. give this recipe a try you wont be disappointed:) i will be making these again!

Baking these right now. Wow! My boyfriend loves them. Super easy to make. I doubled the recipe, used 1 cup white sugar, 1 cup brown sugar and added a tsp vanilla. Rolled the dough into balls and flattened with a fork dipped in sugar, baked on parchment paper. Divine!!

These were awful as this recipe goes. These tasted like hardened sugary peanut butter. They didn't even resemble a cookie.  Won't ever ever ever make these again.

Loved this recipe!
Admit to being wary over lack of ingredients, but in this case LESS is absolutely MORE!
 Being in the UK I used SunPat crunchy! I added a tsp vanilla extract & some dark choc chips to cut the sweetness a bit. I actually used only 3/4 a cup of sugar(packing soft brown about half way in the bottom and topping up to the 3/4 mark with white caster)
Rolled into walnut sized balls & flattened down as they only spread a little, I then baked for about 12 mins at 180 
Perfection! :)

Very yummy! I live in Israel where the natural pb is a lot thinner/more fluid then American pb so they came out a little crumbly.I plan on doctoring my next batch to work with ingredients I have. Maybe a little ground nuts, dried fruit,etc. The simplicity of the recipe makes it very adaptable, which is why I think it deserves 5 stars!

How can you go wrong, super simple, fast, and just as good if not better than any with flour..... WOW plus you can change it up easily by using different PB brands as well as chunky.  We always use egg beaters/egg whites for a little added health/less fat/cholesterol and added Vanilla as we do to all our cookie recipes and we dipped half of them in chocolate.  Cookies were soft with a little crisp to them and we used a mix of skippy natural and jif natural PBs, these are now a standard for us.

Very, very good and easy. I didn't like the consistency though, so I actually added 1/4 C. flour. They were perfect after that slight modification.

These are great! I made these for a small event I was attending and they were nearly gone by the end of the night. The recipe was very simple and I usually have all the ingredients already in my kitchen. I did have to bake these longer than the 8 minutes that the recipe said, I baked mine for 15-20 minutes. I also added 1tsp of vanilla and on the second batch to lower the sugar I used 1/2 c white sugar and 1/4 c of brown sugar. I also topped them with a little bit of nutella. This will definitely become my go to cookie recipe! I've already made two batched this week.

So I tried this with half brown sugar and half white. I also added vanilla. It is VERY good. Dangerously so. It makes me sad that they are so full of calories! I have also made these using Almond Butter. They aren't as sweet when using the almond butter. It is a great variation. Mine did not cook enough in 8 minutes. It took 11-12 minutes for 12 cookies.

Ugh! Sooo good. I only made half the recipe and tiny cookies to try this recipe out and I wasn't disappointed. I used half chunky and half smooth pb. It gave the cookies a nice texture. I'm thinking of using nutella next time, which is gluten free btw.

Ive been making these cookies for years. They are perfect for kids or a quick dessert snack! Gluten and lactose free. Plus you can make them in less than 15 mins. I have also frozen the batter before in small squares like the cookies In the store and make them for a midnight snack!

Amazing and so easy. Similar to another reviewer I used 1/2 cup sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar and added a little vanilla. My husband even thought these were better than the America's Test Kitchen peanut butter cookies I made the week before.

Gosh these are wonderful. So peanut buttery! I also used only 1/2c white sugar, 1/4c brown sugar and some vanilla. These are so hard to NOT eat all of them straight from the oven.

I loved them, but my teenage son said they were too sugary.  I never thought those words would come out of his mouth.  I would love to rate this 5 stars, but with that comment the highest I can go is 4.

Honestly I don't know why you'd ever make the kind with flour in it after trying these. They're the best peanut butter cookies I've ever tasted. My family can't stop eating them. One thing: I think they taste better with brown sugar instead of white. But it works great either way. Double or triple the recipe when you make it. It's also a great gluten free treat if you have guests that have that dietary restriction.

This is by far my favourite cookie to make. It's so simple, I have the recipe memorized already. I followed the recommended additions of brown sugar and vanilla; sooo good.

I am on a dairy free and gluten free diet, so these are awesome for me!  I am making them again for the 3rd time, and just added a tsp of vanilla and used crunchy peanut butter.  Taking them with me to a wedding tonight since I doubt there will be a gluten/dairy free dessert for me there!  Thanks for the great recipe, they taste like fudge!

This is the best gluten free cookie I have ever eaten,  They are moist and yummy! Don't over bake.  I added 1 tsp vanilla to the recipe.  I flattened the cookie balls and drizzled melted semi-sweet chocolate chips over them before baking. No one would ever know they are gluten free - they are just a great cookie!

I had promised an old friend fresh baked cookies when he came over for a visit, but when I looked in my cuboard we didn't have any flour. I had to substitute 1/4 cup of brown sugar, but my friend ate half the batch. My husband also loved them, and he doesn't even like peanut butter!

First time making flour-less and they were very good with a strong peanut butter flavor. I didn't have problems with cookies falling apart, I think because we baked them till just solid enough and let them cool to a softer cookie.

Easy and delicious, I did what others suggested and subbed the 1 cup sugar for 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. My gluten free friends loved them and my hubs didn't even know they were flourless!!

I added 1 tsp of vanilla as I saw on another website, but I thought these "cookies" were awful!  I was worried about them being so easy to make and now I see why, they don't taste anything like real peanut butter cookies.  Super greasy.

Pretty good. The texture is pretty grainy and the cookies don't hold together too well, but they're great for a quick dessert and go great with chocolate!

Turned out really well, I doubled the recipe and used Stevia In The Raw instead of regular sugar. I will most definitely make these again in the future.

Being gluten free isn't always easy but these pb cookies are a wonderful little treat in a world of gross sandy heavy baked goods. They couldn't be any easier to whip up either. My hubs ate about a dozen when I first took them out of the oven. I first saw a recipe for cookies like this in clean eating but have never been able to find it again. I like to use organic pb and egg and raw sugar. Really yum little cookies! Try them you won't be sorry

Since we love peanut butter cups, this was the next best thing.  I did modify slightly based on other reviewers suggestions.  Instead of 1 C. of sugar I used 1/4 C. sugar and 1/2 C. brown sugar.  It was perfectly sweet. I also added 1 tsp. of vanilla.  Since the cookie dough was slightly sticky, I refrigerated the dough for a few minutes and dipped my fork in sugar to make the crisscross pattern on the cookies.  This prevented my fork from sticking to the dough.

I tried this recipe with sugar substitute. Not bad but a little flaky.  Thinking of adding more egg next time and adding a couple of minutes to the cooking time.

Yummy and easy. I've made lots and lots of cookies, but never peanut butter cookies. I followed suggestions using 1/4 cup Splenda, 1/4 cup Splenda brown sugar blend (I can't have sugar),  1t. vanilla and 1t. baking powder. One recipe lasted about 5 minutes with my family. I had to hide some for my newly gluten free son. Will make more very soon.

We had a friend visiting who is gluten free, we studied up on what he could eat and got to work creating a menu.  We felt it was a risk making cookies, but the recipe was so simple we had to give it a try.  He absolutely raved about these cookies - said they were the best he had ever had after going gluten free.  Thank you for such a simple and delicious recipe!!

Very good cookie for being flourless! Yes, very gooey soft center. I did add 1 tsp vanilla and 1 handful of mini chocolate chips. Made 1 inch balls out of dough, baked 8 minutes. Came out perfect. I did let cool about 5 minutes before removing from cookie sheet. Had no problem with them sticking or falling apart. But I normally let cookies cool on sheet for 2 to 5 minutes before removing unless the recipe states otherwise. Texture is a bit grainy since no flour, but not enough to detract from the goodness! Also, last batch I forgot to set timer so cookies baked a bit longer (maybe 10 minutes?) to a medium dark brown. My husband liked these better as the middle was more firm and texture like a regular cookie, yet still chewy. I may just bake whole batch this way next time.

These cookies are so good and so easy.  They were an immediate hit with my friends.  I would suggest, however, to let the cookies sit on the sheet for a few minutes before putting them on the rack.  The first time I made them I tried to immediately put them on the rack and they oozed through and made a mess...they still tasted good, though.

absolutely decadent! made these simply because we didnt have any flour in the house! Doubled the recipe. adding only a tsp of pure vanilla and a dash of baking soda. I did do one cup of white sugar and one cup of brown, and also did one cup of creamy and one cup of crunchy peanut butter just because I happened to have both. These were AMAZING, I will definitely make them again!

I thought they were bland and way too sweet.  Maybe a different kind of sugar would help?  I know some people added brown sugar, which I would do if I were ever to try this recipe again.  A decent recipe in a pinch, though.

WOW!  They are so good!  I made this recipe for my wife because it is gluten free.  I followed others recommendations to mix 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/4 cup of white sugar.  It's really a tasty peanut butter cookie!

Terrific cookie. Substitute Splenda for sugar for a low carb, diabetic friendly cookie.

3.5 stars.  I read the first 11 reviews.  Someone did mention that these cookies were fragile....but whoa.  I refrigerated the second batch and didin't press them down, and it was a little better.  Refrigerating and cooking them a little longer than 8 min resulted in the best cookies.  However, I'm thinking that some gluten would really do the trick.  I did like the taste though.  I used half almond and half peanut butter.  This was the organic healthy stuff, so I added the entire amount of recommended sugar...part white and part brown per other's reviews...and this was already cut down from an entire cup of sugar, but I still felt the recipe could be less sweet.  I also added a T of vanilla.  So this is a solid no flour recipe.

I used 3/4 Splenda (my Krogers carrys their own Brown Sugar Splenda variation) and 1/4 cup sugar free syrup. It helps hold them together. Don't use too much syrup or it tastes too syrupy.

These are very easy and delicious.  I added a splash a vanilla as per other reviewers.  I usually double or triple the recipe.  These cookies get rave reviews.  We have several family members who must not eat gluten so this recipe has become quite popular.  I have shared it at least 5 times.  Sometimes I drizzle the top with chocolate or add a candy kiss for variety but you don't need to.  This recipe makess a very moist, chewy, rich cookie.  I do recommend keeping the dough cold to help keep them from getting "greasy".  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!!!!

These are SOOO good! I first made these for my fiancé 4 years ago back when we were just friends, and he tells me all the time that these cookies are what made him fall in love with me. I usually use a little bit less sugar than the full cup because they can be a tad sweet. These cookies are also great with a dash of cinnamon.

These are awesome!!
I think I am a really good cook and everything I make turns out awesome...
But not peanut butter cookies!! I couldn't make them with out them being hard as cement or just barely edible! :(
Even though I would follow the recipe to the T.
Which sucked because my boyfriends favorite cookies are peanut butter.

I made these cookies yesterday and they turned out AMAZING! 
They are so easy to make and so delicious
Thank you! :)

I tried making these yesterday. They were easy to make and tasted well, but the cookies were very greasy! I got a stomachache from eating one. Any advice on how to make the cookies less greasy?

I used chunky peanu. Butter i added extra vanilla and i also added chocolate chips and they came out delicious. The only thing is tht you need to let the cookies cool completely because they crumble when warm.

Similiar to the recipe I have used for years.  Only I add 1 tsp. of vanilla extract.  I bet almond extract might be good too!

I found this recipe on another site several months ago. It is perfect for my husband who must eat gluten free. It also fulfills his desire for a cookie with more peanut butter flavor, but for him it isn't a cookie without chocolate chips. So, I change it up by adding 1 tsp vanilla, another egg, 1/3 to 1/2 cup gluten free oats, and 1 cup chocolate chips. Everyone loves them.

the key to this recipe is to put the dough in the fridge for at least half an hour, that way its MUCH easier to roll and press. dont overcook them either. Delicious!

If you want or need a flourless recipe (I was out of flour and really wanted some cookies) then this one will fit the bill.  However, I don't think these are nearly as good as a traditional peanut butter cookie, made with flour.  They have a gooey texture inside, like they're underbaked.  They do have a good amount of peanut butter flavor, and my husband liked them a lot.  The kids and I didn't care for them so much.  We'll stick to our regular recipe from now on.  I wish I could have given 3.5 stars, instead of having to choose either 3 or 4.

VERY peanut-buttery, but very delicious! To help tone down the peanut-butter intensity, I added about half a teaspoon/a teaspoon of cinnamon and sprinkled a bit of sugar on top. Makes them even better!

I changed mine. I double it so 1 18 oz jar crunchy peanut butter(we have a bunch of it, and I used jiff), 2 cups sugar, 1 tsp pumpkin spice, and 1 tsp cream of tarter.

I was going to use vanilla instead of cream of tarter but we didn't have any so this is what I did. 

they are REALLY good. If I am not careful my kids will devour them before their aunt gets here tonight for dinner, then their won't be any for desert. ^.^

crafty little kiddos.

used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar as others suggested.  
very tasty.  
the only drawback is this dough spreads alot.  the crisscross that i made did not appear on the cookies.  not the best looking cookies appearance wise. but tastes  good

made them again last nite.  so fragile that they did  not form.  same recipe used.  cant understand why

Really good, but super peanut buttery! I read that people said you need milk with them, and that is for sure! I made them smaller, which was much better.

Perfect when you're low on ingredients.  I really enjoyed these.  I used the brown sugar and white sugar idea, a little flour, a little baking soda...little vanilla (because I didn't have sweetened peanut butter).  Fabulous.  And I ended up with 30 or so little cookies.

Yum! These came up very good. I added a little bit of vanilla. I put some raw sugar on the top of some of the cookies, and they were delicious!

Very good! Despite what others may say, it tastes like a real peanut butter cookie. Everyone in the house liked them. The texture and taste are good. When they first come out of the oven they crumble easily. I just let them cool down and have no problem when they are cool. The time varies when I cook them but perhaps it is because the size of the cookie I make varies. Great dessert for Celiac Disease and others who cannot have gluten.

Good and easy and wouldn't know they don't contain flour!  Glad to find something so easy and good without gluten, believe me!  I did double recipe and used part white/part brown sugar and added vanilla.

Finally a peanut butter cookie that is "peanutbuttery" enough for me!  I'm really enjoying these cookies for that reason alone.  My only issue is that the sugar didn't dissolve completely for me, so I got a slight crystal crunch similar to when you mess up fudge.  Not sure how to avoid that with this recipe, but it was very slight, so not something I'm overly concerned with.  Thanks for a really nice, unusual cookie recipe!

I found this recipe today and made it right away, they are amazing!  Best PB cookies ever! I will definitely be making these often!  I did do the 3/4 cup white sugar, and 1/4 brown sugar, along with adding a touch of vanilla.  Sooo good!

I have been making these for years as a Christmas treat, except we make them as ball cookies and then right out of the oven we top with a Chocolate kiss!  AWESOME!!!  I like to eat mine when they are still warm.  I am also notorious for popping them in the micro. briefly to re-soften the chocolate when they are already cooled!

I read the reviews of people who said they were surprised that these have gotten such great reviews but figured since they were so quick, easy, and made so few I'd try them anyway.  I'm glad I didn't double the batch! I did not care for this recipe.

I really didn't enjoy these-  tasted like Peanut Butter hold the cookie.  They didn't taste much different to me than eating a scoop of peanut butter from the jar.

These came out awesome. They taste great and just melted in your mouth. You must love peanut butter for this recipe. I also used a fork to make the cross design it took only a second, but it made it fancy.

OMG! I think I've just died and gone to Cookie Heaven!  These cookies are a peanut butter lover's dream come true. Super easy to make and unbelievably incredible!  I made a couple minor changes to the original recipe.  I made a double batch using 2 cups peanut butter,  3/4 cup of organic sugar, 2 eggs, and 2 tsp. vanilla.  I happened to have about 1/2 a bag of Andes Baking chips so I threw those in, too.  How will I be able to stop eating them?

Hooray - Low-Carb cookie!! I used splenda instead of sugar (18 packets) and organic, no-sugar peanut butter.  I added a dash of salt, a little vanilla extract and a sprinkle of cinnamon.  Yummy!  Maybe I'll try adding some liquid egg whites next time...some of mine were a bit crumbly.

For the amount of sugar you add, I thought it would be sweeter.  I did a double batch, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1 and 1/2 Splenda (to cut on calories, other Splenda deserts have been just as sweet as originals, so I doubt this was the problem).  They were good though.  I forgot to roll balls for the first batch which came out kind of deflated looking, a little hard to get off the wax paper I used.  After that, I did the balls and they came out fine.  I did (I kid you not) 60 smaller sized cookies.  About the size of a 1/2 dollar coin, maybe a bit more.  For the second 1/2 I added about 1/3 cup chocolate chips (semi-sweet) into the remaining batter.  Good cookies, not sensational, but definitely good.

Recipe was great. Nice balance between chewy and crispy. It was, however, a bit too sweet for me. This was with unsalted and unsweetened peanut butter though. Still fabulous and ridiculously simple. I can't wait to cook up the rest of the dough!

I have used this same recipe for years..everyone loves these. No one has no idea how easy these are to make.  After you put them on the pan, dip a fork in flour and make the criss-cross design on them before baking. So easy to remember!

These cookies were grainy in texture and frankly weren't very good.  They taste like eating a spoonful of butter out of the jar.  If you are looking for a great peanut butter cookie, move on.  But, if you're looking to get a peanut butter fix, these will do the trick.

Yummy, but definitely need to use 1/4 c more brown sugar..gooey otherwise and impossible to form into balls.  Also, cooking time was DOUBLE the 8 minutes!!  Definitely at least 15-16 minutes!!

I was in the mood for something sweet, but didn't feel like taking time to bake anything labor intensive - I came across this recipe and thought it was perfect.  Based on previous reviews, I altered this recipe by using 3/4 cup of brown sugar.  I am glad that I did because if I didn't, it would have been way too sweet (thanks to previous reviews for the head's up on that).  For a peanut butter cookie, I thought these were pretty good, but not great.  The key is to use a good quality peanut butter considering that there really isn't anything else to add to the flavor.  If I had to rate on the taste of the cookie alone, I'd probably give it 3 stars.  But, the prep was so easy - you can't beat a cookie that takes all of 10-15 minutes to prep, bake, and clean-up.  For that, I'd give 5 stars.  So, in the end, I split the difference and give this a solid 4 stars.

These were the best PB cookies I've had! I used 1/2 C brown and 1/2 C white sugar and a dash of vanilla and they were great. This recipe made 8 large cookies.  They are very chewy and delicious!

I added 1/2 cup sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1tsp vanilla, and 1/2 tsp baking soda as another review suggested. They were wonderful cookies! I also doubled the recipe so I could make more of them for Christmas gifts to my neighbors and the kids teachers. Everyone loved them!

These turned out great!  I doubled the recipe and did not make any changes to the ingredients.  I did have to bake them for about 16 minutes.  I took them to a church function and they did not crumble and looked just like the picture!  BIG HIT!  My husband says they are his new favorite PB cookie!

These DO NOT turn out like the picture... So don't think that they will..   I find they are quite tasty with the 1/4 w.sugar & 1/2 b.sugar.. BUT they aren't very presentable.   As soon as I tried to take them off of the pan, they just clumped together, and I've tried longer batches and cooling them for a longer period of time but no luck.. So, don't make them for anyone else but yourself, unless you don't care about presentation.

These are the best peanut butter cookies! The only things I do different is use crunchy peanut butter, add in a teaspoon of artificial vanilla extract, make them by the tablespoonful, and bake for 13- 15 minutes because I like them a bit crispier!

VEGAN-IZED PNB Cookie I vegan-ized this recipe subbing 3 tsp of Ener-G-Egg replacer and 4 TBS water for the eggs.  I also added 1 tsp of vanilla.  I whipped the egg replacer and water till foamy then slowly added sugar.  Then rest of ingred.  And followed baking as directed.  I baked on parchment paper.  Excellent!

Just ad 1 tsp of baking powder and the cookies grow to 2x as large!! Big mama cookies!    A little brittle when removing from sheet.  Use grease. Yum yum tastes the same as w/ flour.

These tasted great. But took much longer to bake than the time stated which forced me to put the trays of cookies back in the oven and unsure how much longer to bake.

Delicious cookies!  I took the suggestion of some of the comments and added some vanilla extract and a little baking soda. I also added sesame seeds (bought some on sale so I've been adding them to everything.)  I loved the cookies, and was amazed that they were flourless, but they were a bit sweet for me. Next time I'll experiment with less sugar.

I was surprised because there are so many good reviews about these cookies. Are they just for people who can't eat flour? Because I made them as the recipe states and the taste is alright, but the texture is super crunchy, like eating raw sugar that tastes like peanut butter :( I noticed that some people made suggestions in the reviews about adding brown sugar and baking soda...maybe they are better after some modifications but they are not very good without modifications.

They were...okay. Passable as peanut butter cookies, but a little gummier than I hoped for. They were easy to make, though! I was skeptical mixing the "dough" and while they baked (for 15 minutes, not 8), which filled my kitchen with a horrid smell of burning peanut butter. My skepticism continued after I took them out of the oven, as they were still quite gummy and nasty. However, after cooling for a little, they were actually okay. I had two. My husband, who is very picky, enjoyed them. I would probably make them again if I'm experiencing a serious PB craving.

if your craving sugar and peanut butter this is the cookie, if your looking for an actual cookie texture this isnt it. i didnt add the vanilla and brown sugar people suggested, i think next time i would.

I baked these cookies for 8 mintues as directed and they turned out nice and chewy, and the second batch i baked them for 13 minutes and they turned out nice and crispy.  I added 1 egg, 1 cup of white sugar, 1 cup of pb, 1/2 tsp of baking powder, and 1 tsp of vanilla, it made 15 large cookies. Very yummy cookies, and so easy.

My 7 year old son made these all by himself (well pretty much).. from the measuring, mixing to the rolling and flattening. They taste really good and are especially impressive because he made them! Great recipe!

these were so simple and yummy!! i did not have brown sugar, so i used 2 cup pb, 1 1/2 cup sugar, a few drizzles of molases, a cap dull of vanilla, and 2 pinches of baking soda, baked for 11 mins and they were delicious!! but i suggest adding wax paper or grease your pan! thanks for the recipe!!!!

Fantastic cookie! So easy to make, perfect if you're in a hurry or don't feel like doing anything even remotely complex. Though I didn't do it, I think that adding some flour to make them a bit lighter would be a good idea.

These were pretty good for 3 ingredients.  I made as written, except a little less sugar, just because I ran out.  I also added a few chocolate chips on top, but I think they would have tasted the same without.  The chocolate wasn't nearly enough to over-power the peanut butter.  I cooked about about 9 or 10 minutes.  Once they cooled, they firmed up nicely.  Pretty impressive.  I'd definitely made for family or company.  Thanks

ok so i mixed white and brown sugar, and added a little cinnamon. they were good but not real peanut buttery. yet for a quick fix it was nice. i took the suggestion from another site and added kisses on them, made it much better.  at the end we added about 2 tbs of sugar more and sprinkled some on top. and for a little extra treat we put mini candy bars on top.

My kids loved these! I did what others said and changed to 1/2 cup sugar & 1/2 cup brown with 1 tap vanilla. Be sure to only cook 8 minutes even if they seem VERY moist; these cookies hardened as they cooled. I think I got a dozen out of this recipe.

I loved the density and richness of these cookies! Really enjoyed them so much more than regular flour pb cookies. They were a little crumbly, but the more they cooled, the better they were as far as that goes! Thanks from a gluten-free, hard to find any good cookie recipe mom!

I was a somewhat skeptical about this recipe, but made it exactly as written.  What a surprise.  The cookies had a great flavor and texture and weren't nearly as sweet as I had expected.  We rolled the dough into balls about 1 inch in diameter and used a fork dipped in sugar to make the characteristic criss cross design on top.  It made 2 1/2 dozen cookies.

First, I substituted Splenda for the sugar and used only 2/3 cup of Splenda as I don't like overly sweet cookies.  I also used sugar/salt free organic peanut butter.  I used the fork to flatten them a bit but still left them at approx. 1/2 inch high as you don't want them too thin.  Since my oven tends to be more on the hot side I baked at 325 for 12 minutes.  The results were wonderful. Not too sweet, wonderful peanut butter flavor and really satisfied my craving for something sweet. They held together fine with no crumbling!  Will be making a couple of batches tomorrow to bring to my mother who is borderline diabetic and can’t have sugar.

Three stars because I do understand that this only has 3 ingredients but that cooking time of 8 minutes is ridiculous. I made 8 cookies and they were still completely gooey at 8 minutes. Ended up leaving it in there for about 32 minutes which was too long, so I'm definitely willing to give this another shot and leave it in for about 25 mins while adding vanilla like everyone suggested. I also used organic peanut butter but next time I'll try skippy or something of that sort.

No complaints!  I also made a criss cross with a fork and flattened them a little.  No one could tell they were gluten free and dairy free.

I remember making  this recipe years ago when I was just a kid. At the time, our version said to roll the dough into balls, flatten slightly, and press a chocolate kiss into the center of each cookie before baking. I'm not a chocolate person, so I eliminated that, but I thought some of the readers on here might like to try it.

Um.  No.  I followed other reviews - used organic peanut butter, less sugar (split white and brown), a dash of vanilla and cooked longer.  These cookies weren't "a bit" crumbly.  The completely fell apart!  They were impossible to even pick up and eat.  I even added some quinoa flakes (similar to oatmeal) to help keep them together.  Didn't work.  Won't be making again.

I get tons of compliments on the cookies. The huge plus is I don't have to do TONS of work and since I almost never have any flour on hand this really helps. It is great for using all that WIC Peanut Butter when it gets close to the sell by date. My kids are crazy for these cookies!

Wonderful!  I'm pregnant, and my big craving lately has been peanut butter.  I'm getting a bit tired of eating it straight from the jar, so I hopped on AR to look for a new cookie recipe to try out.  I've never done flourless before, but I'm amenable to experimental cookies.  These did not disappoint.  There's not too much to distract from the PB flavor, which is great.  I added a splash of vanilla and made them bite sized, as recommended by other reviewers.  I scraped a few off the sheet too early and ruined their structural integrity, so I tossed them in a bowl and plopped some ice cream on top!  This will be my standard response to mushed cookies in the future!

This must be the most-reviewed (1445 at this time) recipe I've ever made from this site! I was a bit skeptical about the concept here. I did make it exactly as written, baking for 8 minutes. The cookies are fairly crumbly and fragile (which I kind of didn't like), and my mouth detected grains of sugar inside (maybe indicating that they should have been baked longer?). The cookies aren't especially fantastic, but I'll bump up my rating to 4 stars because the recipe is so quick and easy. For what it is, this is a pretty good recipe.

Not my taste. We could not eat them, they were dry and not chewy like I prefer my cookies. Also the recipe does not make 6 cookies, it makes 12.

They taste great and the recipe is super simple and fast, but takes a longer cooking time I think and even after they are still a bit ''gooey''. Great though!

My boyfriend actually made these one night he was craving something sweet. Well he got something sweet alright! The only issue we had was the cooking time - it really depends on how big you make your cookies. We had them in our oven for probably over 20 minutes for your regular sized cookies!

I have been making these cookies for over 35 years. They are great and never fail. I was recently diagnosed with diabetes and plan to try them with splenda! Always won Grand Prize in 4-H and at the County Fair. Misplaced my recipe awhile back glad to see it written down to jog my memory. One of those getting older things I guess. Thanks for helping me remember!

Yummy cookies! I doubled the recipe and halved the sugar. I also placed the mixture inside the fridge for an hour to more easily manage forming the cookie later on.

Turned out great! A-. One thing: I know this is supposed to be a flourless recipe but if you sprinkle in a dash or three of all purpose flour into the mixture, it will allow it to bake better and the texture of once it's finished is much much better!

These are so easy to make! The lack of flour makes them taste extra "peanut buttery". I sent them to my boyfriend when he when he was in basic for the Air Force and he loved them! So did his entire unit :)

I was in the mood for homemade peanut butter cookies one night but it was to late. I thought meanwhile Iam going to find a ordinary peanut butter cookie recipe for the following day. Then I came across this recipe and I thought I can make this tonight in no time. I did and they were yummy! I had a glass of milk with it. I slept like a baby all night.Taste like an ordinary peanut butter cookie, but better.

I don't feel I should rate this as I changed it up so much, but I must in order to write this. I am low carbing, so didn't want too much sugar. Used 1/2 cup cooking-splenda and 1/4 cup brown sugar. Added a dash of vanilla and salt. Added an extra egg to hold it together better and 1/4 cup rice flour (to keep it gluten free) and 1/2 teas. baking soda. Results? Pretty good. Would leave out the soda next time. Add more sugar. 5 stars for original recipe.

Very easy recipe.  Fun to do with the kids.  I followed other reviewers suggestions and used 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup white sugar and 1 tsp vanilla.  Next time I will cut the sugar in half.  I will also cook them slightly longer than 8 minutes.

I was skeptical at first, but this is a GREAT quick and easy recipe!!!  I was craving some homemade cookies, but really didn't want to fuss with all the mess and ingredients (just moved and lots of stuff still in boxes).  I used chunky peanut butter and then followed everyone's recommendations to use the 1/4cup sugar and 1/2cup brown sugar.  Couldn't find the vanilla, but they still tasted great without it.  This is now my new favorite quick-n-easy cookie recipe!!!

OK i was wanting something sweet but haven't made it to the grocery store. So this recipe came in handy and OMG these cookies are wonderful! they are so gooey and delicious. I followed a couple of reviewers tips about using 1/4 sugar, 1/2 brown sugar with vanilla just perfect.

This is an excellent recipe.  It is great for anybody that has to be Gluten Free.  The bonus is that they are delicious and easy.

I make these for my husband because he loves peanut butter cookies that are loaded with that real peanut butter taste. These are wonderful and they go fast in my house!

Excellent and simple!  They are very rich and delicious.  Very good if you add a Hershey's kiss in the middle after it's done baking.

These were good. Super simple. I took the advice of others and did 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar and I also added some vanilla extract. They took me about 14 minutes to bake instead of the 8 minutes the recipe lists. I would make these again.

When I made this recipe, I found that 1 cup sugar made the cookies way, way, WAY too sweet. Then again, i'm not crazy about mega-ly sweet peanut butter cookies, but still. If you cut back on the sugar, this recipe is delicious. I've had trouble doubling it in the past, though.

These were so easy and delicious!  I had everything in my pantry that I needed!  I added about 1/2 cup of brown sugar and a splash of vanilla extract.  I think it made all the difference in the flavor.  Be sure to crisscross with fork before baking as you will end up with cookie balls if you don't.  I also had to up the baking time just a few minutes.  My batch made 18.  Definitely pass the milk with this recipe.

I made this for my sister and her husband (who doesn't do wheat gluten), and they quickly disappeared. I used chocolate peanut butter and demerara sugar.

Intriguing flourless recipe which I have been wanting to try for a long time.  For ease and simplicity, a 5-star rating is warranted.  But... the verdict is still out on the taste. My husband and friends gave these a thumbs up, but I thought something was missing--just not sure what (flour or vanilla maybe?). Used ingredients as written. I used a cookie scoop, and the recipe yielded 16.  I flattened the balls slightly with a glass dipped in sugar then added the traditional crisscross pattern with a fork. I had to increase baking time by about 4 minutes. Still not sure about this one???!!!

They taste pretty good, but the recipe yield is a little off.  I made these this morning and got 18 cookies out of it.  That was just a few more than I was anticipating.  But, they are so simple to make, and taste pretty good too.

I found this recipe, found the ingredients in my cupboards, mixed it up, baked and cooled it all in 45 minutes.  So simple.  Scrumptious.  Spray cooking spray on pan, and they come out/off beautifully.

Good cookies although as the recipe says, it doesn't make a lot.  I used others' suggestions regarding changing the sugar to 1/4 c. white sugar and 1/2 c. brown sugar.  I also added 1 1/2 tsp. of vanilla.

Best peanut butter cookies ever.  I used unsalted/ sugar free natural peanut butter and added lightly salted roasted peanuts.  Fantastic!I never though a flourless cookie could taste so good.  I nearly ate the dozen in one sitting.

Based on what other reviewers said, I added 1 tsp vanialla and 1 tsp baking powder.  I also added a pinch of salt to the batter, and then I sprinkled a little bit of extra sugar over the top of the cookies.  They made nice big, chewy cookies.  They are absolutely delicious!  (I only gave 4 stars because I didn't follow the recipe, but I do appreciate the base ingredients given.)

not THE best PB cookie i've ever had, but sooo hit the spot. my boyfriend and i live on a pretty unforgiving budget so we rarely get a chance to buy treats at the grocery...but these ing. are always on hand! i followed recipe exactly, but used a little less sugar. had a grainy texture, but still chewy!

Oh my goodness!  I will NEVER waste flour again on peanut butter cookies.  These are just plain delicious!  As others recommended, I used 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1 tsp. vanilla.  These were wonderful!  If you love peanut butter you will love these cookies!  I can't believe that they don't have flour in them.  You will never know the difference!  Try them and you will love them!

I have a recently diagnosed Gluten allergy, but nuts and eggs don't seem to bother me. I love PB cookies, thanks for sharing this recipe it was so easy to make, it took me less than five minutes then 10 minutes to bake, it really hit the sweet spot, delicious, perfect all around, I added 1 tsp vanilla.

Super easy and quick recipe, my favorite type. Everybody loved these! My husband said they were the best peanut butter cookies ever! They came out soft, thick, and were perfect for sending out in a tin. I made two different batches, one with crunchy and one with creamy peanut butter. Both rocked! I got 18 out of 1 batch, sheeted the cookies as 2 inch wide, 1/2 inch thick paddies. I rolled them in my hand first and then flattened them a bit. I followed the recipe as given. Awesome cookie recipe!

I almost gave these a 3 but since I admittedly don't care for sweet things that much I'll give them 4 because it might just be my sensitivity to sugar.  If I make these again I think I'll do what other reviewers did and use less sugar and maybe half brown/half white.  They are very granular, just seeems like too much white sugar.

These are so easy the kids can make them for something quick and sweet in the evening.  Very peanut buttery.  Best on the day they're made - we freeze the leftovers and that seems to work ok.

The easiest and best peanut butter cookies I've ever made. My family ordered a tub of pre-made cookie dough from a fundraiser (very expensive might I add) and these were better by a long shot. You can add crushed peanuts if you would like for a little more crunch. HIGHLY RECOMMEND

I made these to send to Iraq for my husband and his soldiers.  The first pan I made they came out almost paper thin. So poured the rest in a cookie sheet and made peanut butter bars. They loved them.

Fixed my peanut butter cookie craving, but they weren't as soft as I like. Definately rich. Best when accompanied by tall glass of milk.

Very good cookies. However, I had to throw my batch away because my husband put my stone baking pan back in the cabinet without washing it so all my cookies had a back taste of bacon wrapped lil' smokies.

These were great!  Followed others advice and used 1/2 c. white sugar and 1/4 br. Sugar with a splash of vanilla.  Used fork dipped in sugar to flatten which makes wonderful presentation.  Thx!!!

Very good, and very rich!  A perfect recipe for little ones to help in the kitchen.  I did add about 3 TBS. flour, because the dough was pretty sticky.  I had no trouble with them spreading.  In fact, I was glad I had flattened them with a fork before I put them in the oven--they hardly flattened at all when baking.  Thanks for a quick and easy recipe the whole family enjoyed.

I made these as written but I added a bit of vanilla and before baking I dipped a fork in sugar and did the crisscross thing. YUMMY! Please make these-- you must love the taste of peanut butter though. I found that they held up ok still the next day (and tasted wonderful still) but really started to fall apart thereafter. Next time I make them, I will try 3/4 cup of sugar just to see if I like them as much.

These are really good.  They get 5 stars for being so easy.  I used half brown/half white sugar.  I am snowed in and needed something sweet.  I had the ingredients for these, and they were so simply.  Loved them!

Very good. Though, I don't know how so many people got 6 servings out of these. I baked 32 good sized cookies with the batter. I used 3/4 cup white sugar, and that was sweet enough. 8 minute was definitely too long for me, though; anytime over 6-7 minutes resulted in burned cookies.

A heart attack waiting to happen, but the best tasting peanut butter cookies I've ever had.  Next time I make them I'll probably try halving the sugar though.  I just ate two small cookies and it gave me a sugar rush :)

They are soooo good!! You have to eat them with milk. I made them in little tiny kiss bite size and I got A LOT!! I used a little less sugar (mixed brown and white sugar) but it definetly can take the whole amount the recipe calls for. Thanks for the recipe!!

Awesome peanut butter cookies... it doesn't get much simpler than these. However, it won't hurt to add a little vanilla or few tbs of flour to them. Nothing else! Yummy.

I was looking for a recipe for my mother since she has a celiac and wheat intolerance, I mae up a batch as per recipe and made the dough in small approximately 1/2" balls and got about 2 and 1/2 dozen, me and my fiance love them and they bake up so quick, they are perfect for mothers wanting to make a treat for little ones because they can be done in no time. I will continue to make these for me as well as my mother

I just made thses into peanut butter blossoms and they are delicious.  Per the reviews, I did half white/half brown sugar, added a tsp of vanilla, 1/2 tsp of baking soda, an extra TBSP of white sugar, and 2 tablespoons of flour.  I wanted to make sure they would hold their shape with the Hershey's Kiss in the center.  I also rolled them into small balls, rolled them in sugar, and flattened with a fork.   I used Skippy Natural (creamy) peanut butter.

My first time making peanut butter cookies from scratch and I must say...my family loves them! I did add a  teaspoon of  vanilla extract to the mix. These is one of the easiest cookie recipes on earth.  It's a keeper!

I'm not sure WHAT went wrong w/these cookies, but they tasted AWFUL!!  They were just like little blobs of dough....they didn't change shape when I cooked them & didn't taste good at all!  I knew these were too good to be true!

These cookies are the BEST.  I doubled the recipe and used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar, 1 tbs vanilla, 1 tsp baking soda and a dash of cinimon. I recomend cooling them on wax paper becuse they fall throught the cooling rack.  De-LI-CIOUS!!!!!

THE BEST I HAVE EVER HAD  I did triple the recipe and followed others with 1 cup white sugar, 1 cup brown sugar, and 1 cup confectioners sugar. This has the best peanut butter flavored cookie I have ever eaten. I also topped them with chocolate chips when they came out of the oven. We were eating them before they even cooled.....soooo good

A little bit too sweet, but great for a quick fix. I added vanilla. The sugar does not dissolve enough and they seem a little gritty.

I miss the flour!  These are peanut-buttery, indeed, but I prefer a more traditional cookie.  They are a bit chewier than I like.  My husband loves them.

Very rich, very easy...but not quite as sugary as I'd like.  I modified the recipe with 1/4 C white sugar, 1/2 C brown sugar and 1 tsp vanilla extract...but I think it may need another 1/4 C white sugar.  Still...very good and easy.  Especially good with choc. chips on top! YUM!!

These are great. Best peanut butter cookies I've tried so far.  They were a bit grainy-textured but I'll take that over the powdery, bland peanut butter cookies I've made in the past. I added a splash of vanilla.

Finally! A gluten-free cookie that doesn't taste like cardboard! You def need a glass of milk with these babies though! I followed the advice of others and used 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of just white. I also added some vanilla extract. And doubled the recipe.  I'll be making these again and again!

Such a quick and simple recipe and they are so good!  I didn't do uniform sizes so I did find that the bigger, fatter cookies were slightly more moist, but they were all excellent.  On about half my batch, I made an indentation in the center and filled it with strawberry all fruit jam and let them sit overnight.  The peanut butter and jelly batch was amazing and got lots of compliments from everyone who tasted them.

I wanted a cookie with extra peanut butter flavor and was hoping this was it!  We found the texture to be kind of weird (it's definitely dense) and we ended up liking the flavor of our old standby recipe better.

This recipe is a standard at our house. My kids have dairy/nut/wheat/corn allergies so we use sunflower seed butter instead of peanut butter. They taste amazing!!! I can't even tell they're not peanut butter!

This recipe worked like a charm!  I followed other reviewer's suggestions and used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar as well as about 3/4 tsp vanilla. I also gently pressed a hershey's kiss on the top of the cookies to make "peanut butter kisses," and they were fabulous.  Doubling the recipe made around 3 1/2 dozen 2" cookies.

These cookies are so rich and perfect for peanut butter lovers like myself.  They are also the perfect companion to peanut butter cups which I like to push down into the center just after removing from the oven!  This works best when baked in tart pans.

Doubled the recipe but didn't change a thing. These cookies are so good! My kids and I ate the first batch as soon as they were cool enough, and now we're waiting on the next ones to finish. Quick, easy, and yummy. What more could you want?

These really are fantastic. I doubled the recipe and got about 2 dozen smallish cookies. These are the ultimate soft, chewy cookie. I did add some vanilla extract, just for fun. Thanks! :)

Recommend baking this on convection, same temp, 8-9 minutes.  Browns them up slightly.  Thx for previous reviewers advice to double the recipe!

These were great and very simple to make! However,I used Cashew butter instead because I am allergic to peanuts. I also added vanilla and used 3/4 cup of brown sugar instead of white based on other reviewers suggestions.

These are very easy to make and everything required in the recipe I had on hand. The only thing I didn't care for is they aren't very stable. When I went to put them in the cookie jar they were falling apart even cooking them for the required amount of time. Great tasting though! Ill probably make them again when I need a last minute sweet! Thanks.

Oh my goodness.  I made just as the recipe called for and they were incedible.  No muss no fuss.  I will experiment next time but for a quick, easy cookie recipe, this is perfect.  Thank you so much!  My 17 year old kept sneaking into the kitchen for more!  BTW... This recipe is perfect for 2-3 people with some left over for the next day (standard size cookies)

Best PB cookies ever. Its the only PB cookies I make now. I do change it up a little. I do 1 cup PB, 1 egg, 1/2-1 tsp. vanilla, and 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 brown sugar. Wish I could share them with my 2 year old but she is allergic to peanut butter.

These cookies became a family favorite the first time I made them. My kids ask for them all the time! I added vanilla to the recipe and sometimes throw in some chocolate chips. My husband eats mainly a low carb diet and with no flour in these, they are a treat that he can have!

Yum! Very rich, peanut buttery and simple! I made these and a batch of regular peanut butter cookies and these won the taste test in my house. I, like other reviewers, used 1/2C white sugar, 1/2C brown sugar and added 1 tsp. vanilla. The regular PB cookies came out with  a lighter texture, these are definitely a denser cookie....but packed with PB flavor. Enjoy!

These cookies were great. I made a few changes based on the reviews; 1/2 cup white and brown sugar, 1 tsp of vanilla extract and baking soda. They came out great and were so easy. You just have to remember to let them completely cool before attempting to take them off the cookie sheet, they are very soft when you initially remove them from the oven.

Wow, these definitely are rich and heavy--one is enough to satisfy!  And they could not be easier.  What took the longest was waiting for something else to come out of the oven so I could put these in.  They definitely make a very small amount--I got about 19 cookies out of one batch.  However, it's an easy enough recipe to double if interested.  I didn't even have to haul out the hand mixer for these.  Thanks for the recipe!

I have made PB cookies the time consuming way, but these are the bomb!  These taste better, and to add a little chocolate kick, I added 2 tsps of Ovaltine. My four girls loved them so much, they didn't leave any for their dad!  Took less than 10 minutes and my four year old can even make them on her own. Quick and easy!

My boyfriend loved these cookies!  He said he couldn't stop eating them once he started.  They are very peanutbuttery (obviesly since there's not a lot of other ingredients added to them.  I already have a request to bake another batch.  I will double the batch this round as others have noted it doesn't make very many....

(it made 48 cookies in the pampered chef miny muffin tin)

Used natural unsalted peanut butter, added a teaspoon of vanilla. 10 minutes better than 8. Can't say i'm thrilled with the result, might of done better with some brown sugar like the other reviewers mentioned but that would defeat the novelty of making a cookie with just 3 ingredients!

I added a little bit of vanilla and it made these even better, but HOW DID I NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS SIMPLE FAIL-SAFE RECIPE before now?!

I first made this recipe as a child almost 20 years ago from a cookbook that my grandmother had on hand.Hadn't made them in years until I did so on a whim the other night. They were as delicious as I remember them being!!! I have never had a problem with them falling apart, but have seen them in that stage--they need to be cooked longer if they appear that way. I also like to add a splash of vanilla. Next time around, I am going to try them with Splenda. I was afraid to try that, but afer seeing positive reviews, will definitely use it next time to cut down on calories.

I totally agree that these are the BEST peanut butter cookies ever!! I have always thought that the "classic" recipes for p.b. cookies were not peanut-buttery enough-- but these totally satisfy my p.b. cravings!!

I made this cookie not sure what to expect, but i must admit i cheated. By the reviews, I was not to fond of having a cookie stick to my teeth and be extra sweet so here is how i did it:  I put 1/4 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar  about a half teaspoon of vanilla about 1/2 cup of flour ( i know that defeats the purpose, but couldnt help myself) 1 cup of peanut butter 1 egg dash of salt  The cookies came out really well! I prob wont make the recipe as is, but i will make it with the modifications I added :)

This recipe was in a kids cook book I had when I was little, and is the only way I make peanut butter cookies now. So easy, you can make them on a whim with just what you have on hand. Glad Im not the only one who makes these super easy cookies.

These were fantastic!  Fool-proof and delicious :)  Another fun way to try them- while the cookies are still cooling, push a little dimple into the middle with your pointer finger.  When the cookie cools completely, put just a mini-teaspoonful of your favorite jelly into the middle.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I like these cookies but they i prefer the flour ones. This takes a lot of sugar and peanut butter to make recipe. I found the first batch nearly burned with the given temperature so I lowered the temperature of the oven a little. I did double the recipe to make a good amount of cookies. I highly recommend them for those who do not want flour and want to do it quickly with no wait.

Very tasty and easy. I give it a 4 instead of 5 for the following reasons. I had to bake them longer than what the recipe called for. Also, the recipe calls for dropping them by teaspoonfuls. After noticing that the cookies were not flattening out under the heat, I pressed a fork into them so they looked like the picture. I will do this in advance next time.

These cookies are really Yummy! They are so easy to make. My daughter begged me to make them yesterday when she came home from school. I think this is one of the easiest recipes to make. You have got to try them. I used other peoples advise and split the sugar between white and brown.

These cookies were so yummy.  My 4 year old and I just made them.  They were so fast, which held his attention, and easy too which meant he could do pretty much everything.  Done in 9 minutes we each got a cookie and toasted with a glass of milk.  Will definatly make again and again.

These cookies are delicious! I used extra crunchy peanut butter and stuck to the comments from previous reviews (using vanilla and 2 sugars). However, my cookies were flat. What did I do wrong?

I chose to make these since they were so simple and my son could help. He really enjoyed helping bake and absolutely loves them. I wasn't too impressed with the taste or texture of them, but he really really enjoyed them.

I am on a low carb diet so I couldn’t add 192 grams of carbs from 1 cup of sugar and I don’t like the taste of splenda so I used ¾ cup of sugar free maple syrup.  Mix well, it will thicken up.  The first batch wasn’t flattening and tasted like uncooked dough, not very good.  So I added coconut fakes and flattened the dough before putting them in the oven.  Much better with the coconut.  Next time I am going to add baking soda too.  I made about 16 flat cookies with less then 2 grams of carbs each.  I also had to cook about 25 minutes each batch.

Keeper!  Thanks for the advice for doubling - I did that using (1) jar (17.3 oz)of PB. Definitely bake at least 15 minutes! Next time I might use a bit less sugar-superfine maybe.  But, I can totally forgive the slightly gritty texture because they are so richly peanut buttery and wonderful!  Also easy and 3 ingredients - I love it!

Yum! Okay, I generally follow recipes exactly, but I made tiny changes to this one. Firstly, I added a splash of vanilla and I used natural peanut butter. Secondly, they were NOT finished after 8 minutes, so I ended up baking them for about 15. They came out great! Oh, and I also recommend adding white chocolate chips, but maybe not if you're using regular (sweetened) peanut butter. Make sure you have milk in the fridge before attempting to eat these!!

Great cookies!!  My sister and I were looking for something sweet to eat and this fit the bill.  We took some of the reviewers suggestions by using a tsp of vanilla and added raisins in the 2nd batch. Other than that we followed the recipe as is.  We used Skippy Natural Peanut Butter.  We loved it and gobbled them up.  We will definitely use this receipe again.  Thanks so much!

I must have something wrong...(maybe it was using a mixer.) I wasn't sure if I was just supposed to mix by hand or what. I used Skippy, and these came out very oily. I also wasn't too thrilled with the consistency. Plus these were too sweet. BUT I will give these another try, by doing what some have suggested, and adding oatmeal and trying another type of peanut butter, and less sugar. Because it is a very simple recipe, I feel it is worth playing around with. Thanks.

These were so unique and delicious. I doubled the recipe, used brown sugar and white sugar, almost twice as much brown as white and I added about 1 and 1/2 tbs. of vanilla.  I made them in varied  sizes, one size per cookie sheet- cooking one sheet at a time. I cooked them for EXACTLY 8 minutes- regardless of size which made for very soft, almost crumbly in texture cookies. I think the bigger the cookie the better the consistency was. After 4 days my cookies are still soft. It really suprised my hubby that there was no flour. Great recipe, definetely worth a try.

I was really skeptical. Peanut butter cookies are my all time favorite kind and I was afraid that the lack of flour would make them taste bland. So, I did what others suggested and added 1/2 cup of brown sugar along with 1/4 cup of white sugar instead of just white sugar. I also added the vanilla and baking soda. I rolled them and squashed them like I normally do and left them in for 8 minutes. I have to say, they are pretty darn good. I probably won't replace my normal recipe for this one, but if I want a peanut butter cookie without a ton of work that still has a great outcome, I'm definitely using this recipe again. Thanks!!

These are awesome!!!! I love peanut butter! They are so fast too! Perfect for impromptu company, which is my hubby's favorite way to have company. I do have to bake them a bit longer the recipe says. I'll get fat now that I know about these cookies.

I made 2 batches of pb cookies...1 the Jif recipe and 1 this recipe.  Then did a comparison test with my husband and friends who didn't know the specifics of the recipes.  They ALL chose this cookie from this recipe.  In contrast to the regular recipe with maybe 8 or 9 ingredients.  Why make it hard?  Use this recipe...do add the vanilla though.

I just took these out of the oven.  They taste fine, but they didn't spread out at all and aren't chewy.  They don't look much different than when they went into the oven.  I'm disappointed - these were meant to be a gift, but now I need to find a new recipe to make instead.

I've been making these cookies for years! I found the recipe in a quick and easy cookbook (what can I say, I'm a 5-ingredients-or-less kinda girl!), and they were called "Unbelievable Cookies." There is one small addition in my cookbook, though - 1 tsp. of Vanilla Extract. You'll definitely taste the difference!
   Well, I'm hear to tell you, they absolutely are unbelievably delicious! And, like several other reviewers, people can't believe there's no flour in them! Just good, gooey PB... Yummmmmmmmm!

My girls made these cookies when they were going to college at Purdue in the 80's. For some reason or another they always had peanut butter and sugar on hand.  They now make them for their children. Thanks for bringing back some fond memories.

great flourless option, thanks. a drink is needed on hand for sure. i made these bite size after the first batch because of the sweetness. they do spread if you use white sugar, next time I will add baking powder to help them keep their shape. great taste, fun bite size snack but the average size cookie is a bit too much for me.

Loved them!  Criss-crossed them with a fork before cooking, but don't push down too hard or they get super-flat!  Next time I will add a little vanilla per other user reviews. Yummm.

These cookies were amazing!! I was wondering, how can you have cookies without flour, and all the other ingredients... I had doubts.... But they were the best Peanut Butter cookies I have ever tried!! Everyone loved them.... I had to cook them for about 10 minutes at 375, other than that, wouldn't change a thing!! Thanks so much for this great recipe!

These cookies were amazing.  I like sweet things, but these were a tad too sweet.  I would recommend using 1/4 c white sugar and 1/4 brown sugar.  I also added 1 t. vanilla.  Will make these over and over.

I have never make flourless cookies before, but I was pleasantly suprised! These were by far the easier cookies I have ever made and were very tasty. I made as written except for I added a splash of vanilla.

These cookies were so good. I keep making them over and over and everyone loves them!! I made a few changes myself such as mixing half brown sugar and adding some vanilla extract. My father hates PB cookies and loves these! By far the best peanut butter cookies I have ever made.

Peanut buttery, and yummy indeed. Only problem was I cooked them for far longer than 8 minutes and they still were kinda gooey, and too soft. I still thought they were delicious, I mean how could you not? But I would like them cookie tecture. I also did replace the sugar with half white, half brown and did add a teaspoon or so of vanilla. Yummy, and all, but not the best.

I actually made these because I didn't honestly believe they could work. But they were really good. Took reading a lot of reviews to realize they had to be cooked longer.  10 to 12 was better.  My son and husband loved them!  The only reason I gave them a 4 instead of a 5 is I prefer the other kind.

Great flavor, definitely need a glass of milk with these! Easy recipe, albeit the dough is a bit crumbly. Definitely want to roll into a ball and flatten out with a fork. I used half crunchy peanut butter and half smooth and it turned out really good. Personally, if you only get 6 cookies out of one batch, you're making the cookies too big. I quadrupled the recipe and got about 4 dozen good-sized cookies. I also left them in the oven for about 10 min instead of 8 because they seemed to need a little bit more time.

WOW. So this had to have been the easiest recipe known to man. But what happened to my cookies? I used a no name peanut butter i had, did everything the recipe said and they flattened out like a piece of paper. My cookie sheet looked like a cake sheet. What happened??

I would give this recipe 4 1/2 stars if I could.  These are good, but just not the same texture as a regular peanut butter cookie.  I used 3/4 cup sugar and half of that brown sugar and didn't think they were too sweet that way. They are worth making because the flavor is good and they are so quick and easy.  Nice alternative if you don't have or can't eat flour.

Oh boy. I have made these a few times. Whenever I am feeling lazy, and really want some cookies, I think "Hey, those flourless PB cookies are delicious and easy!" Here's the thing: While they are delicious, and easy to make, they are also incredibly dense and sugary. After eating two or three, it feels like a brick sitting in there and I get a horrendous stomach ache! Eat at your own risk!!!

They don't taste like a cookie the texture varies greatly depending on how long you bake them.  They were too sweet.

I followed another reviewers advice by adding brown sugar, vanilla and baking soda. I doubled the recipe and it made about 40 average sized cookies. Very tasty and they have a nice crisp too! Keep in mind that adding baking soda will make  them expand some.

I LOVE THIS! As a celiac patient I can no longer have any gluten for the rest of my life. Most gluten free recipes for cookies and other sweets requires rice flour and everything is gritty. I feel like I'm cheating on my new diet. I am so happy!

These were very good. I did add some brown sugar in addition to the white sugar. I didn't measure how much I put in. . probably about 1/4 cup or so. At first I had a problem with the cookies being to soft but I realized that I made them way to large. To get the right consistancy make sure the cookies are very small, I would say no bigger than a Tablespoon then push with a fork. Make sure you give them enough cooling time. After I got the size down these were very easy and good. A sweet treat in a fix!

I had a craving for peanut butter cookies but was lacking on the ingredients, I didn't feel like going to the store so I tried these out.  They were way too rich, not a substitute for regular peanut butter cookies.

These were okay, but thankfully we don't have any issues with flour in our house because I definitely like the traditional peanut butter cookies better.  Mine came out a little bit on the greasy side - I did use a natural peanut butter, so maybe that's why, and they were just "ok", flavorwise.  I can see us maiking these again, but maybe I'll try a different brand of peanut butter - maybe even a chunky variety.  They are super easy to make, so nice to have this recipe on file!

This is how my dad taught me to make peanut butter cookies! You can use splenda also and the taste is still outstanding. We often like to add a Hersheys Kiss in the middle as it cools and the chocolate melts in your mouth! Also have added oatmeal in the mix which also makes for a nice flavoring.

Made a batch with sugar and a batch with Splenda to compare.  Added a splash of vanilla to both batches.  Had to leave in the oven for an extra 5 minutes as these were goo after 8... then I followed other reviewers' advice to let them cool a little longer on the pan than I normally would.  The Splenda cookies were less gooey, but are very crumbly...  and I have to say I like the texture of the cookies with sugar a little more.  Can't beat this recipe for ease, and ability to sub Splenda to get a reduced carb cookie tho...  The flavor of both sugar and non-sugar versions was rich and definitely satisfies the PB jones.

Good cookies.... I like how quick they are to mix up... not too much measuring and also quick clean-up!  My advice, double the recipe, use a small scoop and criss cross with sugar.  Bake about 10 minutes and ALLOW TO COOL A BIT ON THE PAN BEFORE REMOVING. If you don't allow them to cool a bit... they will be very fragile and break/crumble.  My boys went nuts for these and that's always good!  (I usually use a recipe that has butter, sugar,flour and etc...)

YUMMY! I doubled the recipe, added a teaspoon of vanilla, and used splenda. They fell apart and crumble on touch because I used splenda, but WOW they are still the best BP cookies I've had! I"m fine with eating many smaller pieces of a great cookie. I made some for a diabetic friend of mine and she loved them also.

These cookies were very tasty! I added some peanut butter chips to the mix and they were so good! My kids & I couldn't get enough! (I found that they didn't bake well if you didn't flatten them out with the bottom of a glass coated with sugar.)

I was looking for an easy cookie recipe when I found this recipe. I am not a big fan of peanut butter but figured I'd give it a try and boy am I glad I did. I made them exactly as stated with Peter Pan creamy peanut butter. I used aluminum foil on top of the cookie sheet and very lightly greased it. Instead of baking them for 8 minutes, I baked them for 16 minutes and let them cool on the cookie sheet for 10 minutes. They were perfect, so perfect in fact that I've made them 3 times in the last week. BTW, I can get between 18 and 21 cookies with each batch. Love 'em!

I decided to make these after my BF asked, "Whats for dessert?" And I didn't feel like making a mess in the kitchen. I loved how I could mix all the ingredients in one bowl. I also mixed some ground flax seed to these and made them super small so would hold together easily. Baked for 8 minutes on parchment paper. I loved them! So good!

I tweaked the recipe, as many others have, using white sugar (1 cup), brown sugar (1/2 cup), baking soda (1 tsp), and vanilla (1 tsp). I doubled the recipe and the result was 17 gooey, decent-sized cookies. Absolutely delicious results!

Followed the recipe exactly using just white sugar. Rolled and pressed with a fork and cooked for 8 minutes. Very peanut buttery and great texture.

These are YUMMY!!!...You can smell them from the other side of the house...:) Some people didn't really like the grainy texture, but that's what I absolutely LOVE about it!!!...That's probably because I love to top my Peanut Butter Toast with sugar...and it has to be granulated sugar!!...It's not necessarily the sweet part that I love...It's the crunch...:D

I was eager to satisfy a sweet-tooth quickly and nothing was easier than this. I was nervous when the 8 minutes was up and they didn't look done, so i left em in an additional 5 and after they cooled, they came out YUMMY. Except they still could of used an extra few mins.

I love the speed, simplicity, and texture of these cookies- crisp outside with a chewy inside. I'm a HUGE fan of peanut butter and these have a lot of PB flavour. The only change I made was to use half white sugar and half brown sugar and a splash of vanilla (I do this with most of my deserts... personal preference :D). This recipe can also be halved, which for me made one dozen cookies if dropped by the tablespoon- perfect if you just want a quick snack. Thank you so much for the recipe!

i really enjoy this recipe; however, i did throw in a tablespoon of flour...it needed something to combat the gooeyness of just the mixture alone.  that aside, i like this recipe and will continue to use it.  thanks much!

I made it with about 2/3rd of the sugar necessary and it was just right.   However, 1 batch made 6 very large cookies and they didnt come out as flat as in the picture. They were large mounds instead. I would say 10 cookies would be a better estimate.

I thought these were delicious! I thought it might be better with some almond extract and it had an amazing flavor and smell...I might have added to much though. I love the fact that this recipe is easy to tweak which is what I need to because I love to personalize things, but I still need it to turn out semi normal.

Way too grainy--the sugar did not dissolve properly.  Still taste good enough for serving yourself when you're craving something sweet, but is not something I'd make for others.

They're ok but i like this more if they weren't so gooy inside. i also like then better if you spread a little bit of peanut butter on top for the extra taste. makes you need milk more.

These were AWESOME! But when i baked them some of them turned out really squishy, and i let them cool completely so i dont know what the problem was, but other than that these are awesome!

Who would have thought a Peanut butter cookie recipe could be so easy and delicious. I was very sceptical until I made them. I was floored, they came out perfect !  Very very delicious !  I got 20 cookies out of it which isn't too bad. I will make them again and again. They are so easy to make if you have to go somewhere in a hurry with a dish to pass. LOVE THEM !

This is a great recipe for people avoiding flour. My son can't have gluten so these are a perfect and easy treat to make. I have made these a couple times now. The first time I went by the recipe and they are good. But the recipe doesn't make enough and they wanted to crumble a bit. So the second time I made them I used 1 1/2 cups white sugar, 1/2 brown sugar, 2 cups peanut butter, and 3 eggs. The extra egg helps hold it together as someone suggested it might in an earlier review. These were better. Perhaps next time I will use crunchy PB instead of creamy for an added texture. Great starter recipe thanks...I'm rating this one on the first time I made them.

Have made these cookies before and they were delicious. Not only do they have a great flavor (yes milk required!) but it only has a handful of ingredients that most everybody has on hand! Also, they are lower carb.

Really,really good!! I ended up making them a bit too big -- ahem -- huge -- but they didn't crumble or fall apart like some of the other reviews said. I doubled the recipe and added vanilla and baking powder. The second half of the batch had chocolate chips. :) They're verrrry chewy today, which I really like. We'll see how long they last!

I'm in Phase 3 of the HCG diet where you can't eat sugar or flour.  This is tough since I'm a cookie fan! I've made this recipe several times now using Splenda instead of sugar and adding a couple of tsp of sugar.  Very good recipe that's sugar & flour free!

I followed some of the recommendations of others by using 1/2C sugar and 1/4C brown sugar with 1/2 tsp baking soda.  WOW!  Fantastic.  My kids ate the entire batch.

I love this recipe, just based on it's simplicity. It works great in a cookie press also.  But to give them some life, I dip them in chocolate, on the bottom and then drizzle the tops as well. This is also great if you have extra Peanut butter, that needs to be used. This recipe makes 36 in my Pampered Chef cookies press. www.pamperedchef.biz/mccall

No one cared for these in my house.    I noticed another reviewer also said that they were too crumbly; the sugar tasted grainy like it didn't dissolve.  I felt like I was eating sand.  Thanks but I'll look for a different cookie next time!..

This is an awesome basic recipe. As per other reviews, I used the half white/half brown sugar, 1 tsp baking powder and a splash of vanilla. But i decided to go "wild" and add about 3/4 cup of quick oats. I had to add another egg, but they turned out fabulous, and it made 27 good sized cookies. My husband, who doesn't like oatmeal, wants me to make these from now on. I'm sure they won't last very long either once my 3 1/2 year old daughter gets her hands on them!!

We didn't have any butter on hand but I still wanted to make pb cookies... so this was one of the only recipes I could find without butter. I personally hate peanut butter (I made them for my boyfriend because he loves peanut butter cookies) so I can't judge them fairly, but my boyfriend says they're "crumbly, but in the good way. Still moist though. Could use maybe just a dash of cinnamon. But overall, DElishus."  I put almost a whole bag of jumbo sized chocolate chips in the batter and doubled the recipe. Makes *exactly* 2 dozen cookies when doubled. I took other people's suggestions and added about a teaspoon of vanilla extract to the batter as well.   I really like brown sugar so I used 1 cup brown, 3/4 cups white. They're just the right amount of sweet.  My dad says they are "Without a doubt the best peanut butter cookies I have ever had".

A make this recipe all the time and my mother loves it but I made some changes. To me, the consistency was way too thick so I added (on accident, actually) two eggs. It made creamier, less rich cookies but they were easier to get onto the pan. Also, I usually make the batter into 1 inch balls and cook for 12 minutes in 320 degrees F or until they're just turning brown on the edges.

Oh. My. Goodness.  Had I known it was this fast and easy to make such delicious cookies, I would have been making these for years.  My 3 year old practically did this by himself.  And the cookies were heavenly.

Could not believe how wonderful this were!  Totally melt in your mouth.  Just remember to use a wet fork to make the traditonal cross markings on each cookie. These were a hit!

this was super easy and a big hit. I added 2 tbs. of Fluff(aka. marshmallow creme). My family loved that part. I could've cut the sugar but they said it was fine and we don't have sweetteeth around here.  i used 1/2 cup br. sugar and 1/2 cup of white and also added 1 tsp vanilla. I'll be making these again, for sure.

amazingly and surprisingly delicious! you absolutely cannot tell there is no flour in them! definitely a recipe keeper!! :)  -- tips: substitute with 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar, and add a bit of vanilla extract. I made mine into small bite sized cookies, reducing bake time to 6 minutes. --

I'm not so sure about these... As others suggested I added vanilla and a few Tbsp. of flour.  I used 1/2 cup natural peanut butter and 1/2 almond butter as others successfully tried.  Even with unsweetened nut butters, these were way too sweet for my taste and also quite dry. I baked for 10 min. as they seemed not ready at 8 min...perhaps I overdid them?  I may have to try a more "classic" peanut butter cookie recipe next time.

I recently discovered that my daughter can't have gluten. I'm excited for her to have dessert with us tonight. These cookies are yummy & perfect for kids. I did sub the 1 C sugar for 1/4 C white sugar & 1/2 C brown sugar. I also added 1 tsp vanilla as suggested. I made them bite-sized & they only needed to bake for 6 min in my oven & at high altitude. Thanks!

Very heavy but wonderful. I doubled the recipe-split the PB to 1 cup reduced fat PB, 1 cup extra crunchy. Used 1 cup Splenda and 1 cup brown sugar, 2 eggs, 1 tsp vanilla. I had to bake the cookies for more like 12 min in my old oven. At 8 minutes they were still too gooey. Overall-  I like 'em!.

These cookies are very soft. I have never had such soft cookies!! They came out just a tad bit normal on the outside but just as the way they were put in. Dough-y. They were good but very,very,very soft!!

Delicious and very peanut-buttery! I loved them ;) The great thing about this recipe is if you're in a bind or if you're just in the mood for something delicious that doesn't take long to make, you can be done with these in less than 15 minutes total! Great recipe, definitely worth all 5 stars!

These are great! You should to let the mixture stand for 5 mins before scooping. Use the tines of a fork to make criss cross pattern on each cooking before baking!

These were pretty good. Made them last night and they were tasty right out of the oven but I have a feeling they are going to be very crumbly today. I like that the dough takes 5 minutes to make, except I will definitely use less sugar next time. I used natural, sugarless PB and they were still too sweet!

Absolutely the best peanut butter cookie ever. My husband was in shock that I didn't use any butter in the cookies. I used homemade peanut butter which is made by processing 4 cups of peanuts with 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon of peanut butter in a food processor. You just process the mixture until the texture is to your liking. The homemade peanut butter will kepp for a month in your refrigerator.  These cookies came out great with the homemade peanut butter. I will definitely make these again!!!!

Great little recipe and won't even need it on paper to remember again. I was in a pinch with unexpected guests and no treats to offer, so I whipped these up in a flash! None were left! For my oven, I baked these cookies at 325 for about 9 or 10 minutes. They were quite soft when they came out of the oven, perfect within 5 or 10 minutes to serve.

I've made this twice now in two weeks! My son loves to help me bake so this is a great recipe that doesn't require a lot of work or mess. I made the recipe once to the "T" the other time I added a little cinnamon to the batter & sprinkled sugar on top. I thought the second was more flavorful. Thanks so much for a great, simple, quick cookie recipe!!!

Perfect cookies. I made around 16 cookies. 1 cup of sugar is too sweet for my taste though. Perhaps I will try 1/2 cup with 1/4 of brown sugar instead next time.

Surprising good. I can't believe how they turned out with only those ingredients. I did add 1 tsp of vanilla & semi sweet chocolate chips. yum yum...will make again!  Also, made a second time with almond butter instead of peanut butter & then added walnuts to the above ingredients. I liked this even better!

These cookies were awesome. The first time I made them I altered the recipe a little, following the advice from previous bakers. I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 brown sugar. I also added the suggested 1/4 cup flour.  I know this recipe is the "flourless PB cookie," but the flour allows for more cookies, and the consistency was good.  I also used natural peanut butter, and in my opinion they taste better. (some people might not like that though)

These turned out well for me, baked for 10 minutes. I did add a little flour to help with consistency, and used a bit of vanilla extract.

I made these for the super bowl, so I used the lines to make them look like little footballs. So cute! I ended up having to bake them for twice as long (maybe I didn't flatten them enough?).

These cookies are okay.  They have a really rich PB taste, but can be crumbly when removing from cookie sheet.  I am still looking for the perfect PB cookie recipe:(

These were surprisingly good considering how easy it was to throw everything together.  Very peanutty taste, which is what I was looking for.  I only used 3/4 cup of suger (1/2 white, 1/4 brown) and they were plenty sweet enough.  Also used reduced fat peanut butter.  I didn't find them heavy at all as some others did, but I guess it's all just a matter of taste.  Will definitely make this quick and easy recipe again!

I even used splenda and low fat peanut butter with these and you would never ever know the difference.  They are so rich make sure to have a glass of milk handy.  One of these satisfied my craving for something sweet.  I doubled the recipe and got 32 cookies.  So easy took me 5 min to mix it all up.  Doesn't get any easier than that.

I love this recipe.  I was given this exact recipe by a coworker years ago, and I haven't looked back since. Absolutely the best peanut butter cookie recipe ever.  Even better than my mom's (but I'd never tell her that).

I made this recipe with cashew butter instead of peanut butter because my hubby is allergic to peanut. They are FANTASTIC! I cannot stop eating them! I made them with a brown and white sugar mix and added vanilla as some others recommended. WOW!

I make these cookies all the time! Except I substitute Splenda for sugar, add 1 tsp. of vanilla, and use reduced fat peanut butter. It is a light and sweet peanut butter cookie. I love the consistency of these cookies. Better than any regular calorie filled PB cookie! These are great!!

This is the BEST recipe for PB cookies ever! Simple, and very little mess. The only thing I do different is make the cookies a little smaller so they are "two bite" size. Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe!

AMAZING!  I subbed a 1/4 cup of splenda for the sugar.  Also, I made an insane topping by melting some dark chocolate (lowest sugar content I could find) and mixing in enough half and half to make a fondue-like frosting. You saved my low carb diet with this recipe!  THANK YOU!

This is the best cookie I've ever had!  Perfect just the way it is.  I'm pregnant and had a craving...these were fast, easy, and so yummy.
I did have to cook them for about 20minutes for the perfect consistency.

Very good cookies.  Also simple, which is always a plus.  I made them for a New Year's Day party.  Everyone loved them.  They are very sweet, so you will need some water or milk.

I didn't believe it until I made them myself.  They are fantastic.  Be prepared to double or triple the recipe because they don't last long.

I used a 2tsp. scoop and got 2 dozen + 2 ... one batch was plenty. Did you all use a TBSP and not know it? Other than that, these are awesome.

I have to say..these are by far the quickest and easiest cookies ever! BUT...something just doesn't remind me of what a classic peanut butter cookie SHOULD taste like. The cookie was very good..but honestly, I am a purest here.

Excellent recipe as written.  I used them for gift cookies for Xmas.  Only problem is they are a bit on the heavy side as written, either using regular or splenda sugars.  Last time I made them, I added 3 tbsps of Milk, 2 tsp vanilla, and some cinnamon to a double batch, they smoothed out into wonderful cookies, also tried adding white chocolate chips once, another excellent addition. Also, even a single batch made more than 6 cookies.  I don't know who set up the servings at 6, but I got about 15 cookies per batch Myself. A+++++

It is hard to believe that this recipe would work but they are THE BEST of any peanut butter cookie you'll find. They are so rich with peanut butter taste. As I said you won't belive it until you try them

This recipe is elegant in it's simplicity. I love this recipe and will use it frequently, as it is the quickest and most simple cookie recipe i know of. I added a handful of chocolate chips to the batter and used brown sugar instead of white. Cinnamon might be a good addiiton as well. 
Wonderful!

We love these cookies!  We like ours super-soft, so I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar.  It did take about 15 minutes to cook though...

UPDATE:  Since discovering that my child is reacts to sugar, I changed the recipe by substituting sugar completely with Brown Rice Syrup.  Still delicious as ever!

Cookies are good but i added the vanilla and used 1/2c white sugar and 1/4 cup of brown. It took me 4 trays to get them right - in a gas oven 6 minutes at 350 is perfect.
Thanks for the recipe!

These are great! We live overseas and sometimes it's hard to get all the ingredients for recipes. My husband thought these were great, I thought they were a little hard to tell when done. I added a pinch of salt.

Wonderful.  I added chopped almonds to batter and rolled in chopped pecans, gently flattened with 2 fingers and baked for 9 minutes.

I made these because I couldn't find my recipe I usually make and had limited ingredients.  My kids love them.  My husband and I neither one care for them.  Yesterday after making them, they were gooey and today they are hard as rocks.  If I make them again, I will change the recipe and add at least a little flour.

Very delicious!  Didn't expect such a simple recipe to be so good.  Gave these to my neighbors at Christmas gifts.  Everyone loved them.  I dId do the 1/4 cup brown sugar and 3/4 cup white sugar AND added 1 tsp vanilla extract as many reviewers suggested.

I made two batches back to back because my first did not seem to tutn out right. They were way too soft to the touch and seemed to be mushy so I put them back in the oven for another 5 minutes while I made the second batter. When I took them out they were much better. I rolled balls with the second instead of just dropping and they came out great. I followed the suggestions about splitting the sugars and added vanilla. Very good. Glad I tried them again!!

Great recipe in a pinch!  I rolled the dough into small balls, dipped the tops in sugar, and used the tines of a fork to flatten each.  They took a few minutes longer than what is stated in the recipe.  A single recipe made about 45 small cookies, which was perfect.

We loved these!  My five year old daughter made them and they turned out wonderfully!  Not as doughy as some peanut butter cookies, which is what I liked about them, plus the fact that they can be whipped up in no time with ingredients that are normally on hand.  My sister with Celiac's disease (can't have gluten/flour) was so happy to find a gluten free cookie recipe that actually tastes good!

I have been baking cookies for two days to give to people for gifts this holiday season was looking for one more easy cookie to add to the baskets. Well I was so glad to find this SIMPLE wonderful cookie. Even my kids who suffer through the holiday baking days were really surprised that a recipe with out flour could be so so tasty. Thanks this one is a keeper.  And Happy Holidays!!!

I was pleasantly surprise.  I had to make a batch of cookies for my son's basketball team and was running late in preparing them.  I usually avoid using new recipes for the first time when I am cooking something for someone else, but I took a chance.  It worked out so well.  I can hardly believe it was so simple.  I don't know how anybody, who likes peanut butter cookies, can give them anything lower than five stars.  Good, simple, a what you already had in the cupboard type of recipe. Thanks, these cookies are now a family tradition!

Simple and delicious! I made mine small, rolled into tight balls then pressed them with forks. I baked mine 9 minutes and they were perfect. I am adding them to all of my baked holiday goodies in the freezer. I think I will drizzle with chocolate to dress them up for the holidays- great idea that I found on one of the reviews!

Very good cookie! Seemed chocolate would help cut that strong peanut butter taste, so I added 1/2 cup hot cocoa mix and then cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups (I doubled the recipe). Then after mixing everything, I put in 1/3 bag mini M&Ms. Once the cookies were dropped onto the cookie sheet, I also pressed in a Baker's semisweet chocolate drop on top. YUM!! Will definitely make again. Yielded 3 dozen.

It's my favourite recipe. The best peanut butter cookies. However I use Kraft light peanut butter (lower in fat) and only 1/2 cup of sugar. Just like it says on the back of the jar. Yummy.

These were very good and easy. They are rich and chewy but I prefer old fashioned cookies with all the ingredients. If you're on a low carb diet use splenda and you've got it made with these. HAPPY BAKING!

Considerably better than other gluten free cookies...  they taste perfect.  Perhaps an extra minute or so in the oven would help.

These were actually really good.  I am doing low-carb, so I substituted 2/3 c splenda for the 1 c of sugar and used natural peanut butter with no sugar (use creamy).  I also whipped a little cream with cocoa powder and splenda and put it on top.  It turned out really good, peanut butter and chocolate. And only a couple carbs per serving as well.  I will make this again!

This recipe is DELICIOUS! I took the advise of others and used 1/2 white, 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 tsp baking soda and 1 tsp vanilla. I also added walnuts and chocolate chips by request of my boyfriend! I'm sure the guys at his work will beg him for some...will definately make again and again!

I will admit that I was kind of skeptical about this recipe and it was that skepticism that led me to make it (that and I really didn't want to shop for stuff.)  It came really good!  Kind of like a reeses's cup in taste.  I did the 1/4c b sugar, 1/2 c sugar, added a dash of vanilla and 1/2 tsp baking soda.  I had to leave mine in longer than the 8 minutes that was suggested.  I think it would be great to add white chocolate chips or carob chunks and maybe some nuts too.  All in all I'll be making this again.

I started making these prior to reading all the reviews...I must say, a lot of people managed to mangle them. 

These were actually pretty impressive, though I strayed and split the sugar between white and brown.

They weren't gritty, they didn't burn on the bottom and they weren't excessively oily like I was afraid they'd be.(I even greased my first sheet!)

But I wouldn't recommend them if you aren't a huge fan of peanut butter. ^_^

Well, they didn't turn out too bad. I followed the directions to a t. They weren't grainy like some people said, but I couldn't tast the penutbutter very well. Over all though it was ok. I would've added vanilla and flour lol

I made it exactly. no alterations to recipe.  It was VERY heavy, Very peanut buttery, and kinda crumbly, didn't hold together very well. My 22 mos. old grandson liked them, my daughter,not so much, but I enjoyed them with LOTS of milk. Thanks for a quick recipe.

These are wonderful -- thank you for the great recipe.  Variations: I used crunchy peanut butter instead of creamy. I have also put in peanut butter/milk chocolate swirl chips into the mix.  I've also pressed a peanut butter kiss into the center of the cookies right after they come out of the oven.  Yum!

Delicious--definitely need a glass of milk (or at least some water) to wash these down, though!  I used Trader Joe's Natural Creamy Salted Peanut Butter (I drained the oily layer from the top of the jar before using), Light Brown Sugar, 1 Large Egg and about 1/2-1 teaspoon Pure Vanilla Extract and they turned out WONDERFULLY!  Can't beat how simple these are, especially for a gluten-free cookie!

I found this recipe back in 1995 when the internet was just getting started... I had my doubts, and to my surprise... this is absolutely the best peanut butter cookie recipe ever... easy and fast to do.  I told my wife and she didn't want to bake these, but was forced to because of lack of other ingredients.  She loves it!!!

Tried this recipe w/ a generally reliable egg replacement and it DID NOT work! So it doesn't seem to be able to be made vegan. Unfortunate.

I had a really hard time trying to get these done without burning them. It might just be my oven. The first batch were half burned and half okay. The ones that didn't burn tasted wonderful. The second batch all burned and I made sure not to let them over cook. I think that I'm the only one this has happened to because I don't see any other reviews listed that talk about this problem. So it probably was my oven. Word of advice, if you have an oven that tends to burn things I wouldn't use this recipe. I couldn't give a bad star rating though because the ones that did turn out okay tasted sooooooo good.

You can't get better than a flourless cookie, especially when they turn out as perfect as these. You can turn them into a truly low fat cookie as well, using Splenda instead.
Everytime I make these, the texture is perfect every time. Flattening them with the traditional fork criss-cross does not make them too crispy. 
I would make sure you bake them for the full 8 minutes though as they tend to be too creamy.

I just made these with my 3 year old daughter. It was a perfect recipe to do together...simple and yummy! I followed the advice of some of the others. We used 1/2c each of white and brown sugar, added a tsp of baking soda and some vanilla powder (because we are gluten-free). I did need to bake them a few    minutes longer than the 8 minutes, though.  We baked ours for 10-12 minutes each batch.

Not the best peanut butter cookies I've made or eaten but these are still good and SUPER easy to make.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Would make again - mostly due to few ingredients.

I have Celiac Disease so I make these to satisfy my sweet and carb tooth. I rather use brown sugar or the brown sugar Splenda. I also use chunky peanut butter sometimes to mix it up, but I almost always use a 100% natural peanut butter so there is not all the  and added sugar in the non-natural peanut butters.

I was so intrigued about the lack of flour in the recipe I had to try it.  DELICIOUS!!!!!  These are the best peanut butter cookies I have ever had. Every time I make these people ask me for the recipe.  Simple and delicious.

I don't like em too sweet so I used half the Splenda (instead of sugar). Not too bad for me but didn't get rave reviews from the rest of the crowd...

amazing!  I love these cookies!  perfect for my peanut butter craving today (i'm 39 weeks preggers) and didn't want anything but big peanut butter taste.  So easy to make and very good.  I did add 1 t vanilla, used 1/2 C brown sugar and 1/2 C white sugar and used crunchy non-hydrogenized natural peanut butter.

For sure they would be way too sweet using the sugar called for. Especially if you use un-natural peanut butter. I used about 1/3 C brown sugar and 1/4 white and it was really sweet still. I used natural peanut butter, a dash of pure vanilla, and a T of rice flour. I put a mini reeses on each one (I made it into about 28 small balls) and baked for the 8 minutes. Not bad for low carb!

These were great. I wanted something sweet that would not take a lot of work or make a lot of servings and this fit the bill. I didn't even turn on the conventional oven, I used my toaster oven to bake these. I ended up with four really big cookies. They are a bit grainy when you eat them hot which I did not mind. But it turns out they are even better after sitting overnight. The grainy feeling decreases and it tastes like a peanut butter cookie made the "traditional" way, I could not tell the difference. Great recipe I will definitely be using this one again.

I simply couldn't believe that this would work, so I had to try it!  They were amazing!  They are, however, a little grainy so I tried adding 1/8 cup flower and they lost the grainy quality but were not as rich, which I loved.

Im am not a fan of peanut butter cookies but my husband is and he loved these, and for the ease in making them I gave them 5 stars. I added the tsp of vanilla and also used a fork to push them down like I do other PB cookies. They will be soft when you first take them out but let them cool down completely and you got a great cookie.

way too sweet, even with the suggested additions of flour, vanilla, and brown sugar. didn't like the grainy texture either. but this recipe was very easy to make and it also handled well after refrigerating for 15 minutes.

I altered the recipe a little bit simply because I'm not a huge fan of so much sugar.  Instead, I used 1 cup of creamy peanut butter, 1 egg, and 1/2 cup of brown sugar and baked for 8 minutes.  They came out wonderfully and definitely sweet enough for me.  The recipe is definitely for just a few cookies, though!

So for only having three ingredients, these aren't bad at all. However, I would have to disagree that these are the best pb cookies. They definitely taste sugary with a grainy texture so be warned that these will be very, very sweet. Maybe if I took some suggestions from others such as adding vanilla, baking soda, a little flour and refrigerating the dough for a little bit, they would taste better.

I would give this recipe 3.5 stars if I could.  I reduced the sugar and added brown sugar and vanilla extract.  The cookies are very chewy (which I like) but taste like something is missing.  More sugar next time?  I will definitely make these flourless cookies again, but I wouldn't serve them to guests.  Thank you.

I was intrigued with the lack of ingredients in this recipe, I had a immediate hunger for cookies, so I went for it. They turned out just like I thought they would which is exactly opposite of what others reviewers said. They taste just like peanut butter mixed with sugar. They are the best when warm, more cookie like. However, after they are cool, not good. They still have a good peanut butter flavor but they are not cookie like. They look like cookies but don't waste the short amount of time it takes to make these.

Easy & delicious! These can be baked with all brown sugar, and they turn out good that way, too.

Just made em. They're the bomb. They rock!!! Also, I used crunchy peanut butter because that's what we love. And it was the Great Value brand, by the way & it was great.

Hello ...  I made these also and found them to be soooooo sweet, too sweet.   I loved the flavor but the sweetness was too much.  I then tried splenda but wasn't pleased with the texture.   Perhaps the lady who put 3 tbsp flour had the right idea.

I think these are great.  They taste like regular peanut butter cookies.  Just don't overcook them.

So easy and so good! I had no problems making these at all. Like others did, I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, rolled them into balls and used a fork dipped in sugar to smoosh them down. They are so rich you only need to eat one to get your sugar/peanut butter fix! :)

Very simple and inexpensive to make. I always smash them with a fork then sprinkle sugar them before I bake. Then again when they come out of the oven. ~smiles~

The first day I tasted these, I didn't like them very much, I prefered the old recipe.  Then, I put them in an air tight container overnight.  Wow, were they good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Be careful with how long you bake them, these are a little tricky to get just right. They get pretty dry if baked til they're browned.  Also, I don't think it says to smash them down with a fork, do this!

This is a great tasting recipe.  For all of you who are allergic to peanut butter or have someone in their family who is I used a soy nut butter (fake peanut butter), and it worked great.  I also just made one big cookie out of it, and cut it up like a pizza.  It was a little drier this way, but still it was great.

My son's favorite Papa came over to build his train table. As he was builing in my son's room, I went on line to find a PB cookie recipe. This one is perfect... Just enough for him to take home, delicious and FAST. Thanks for sharing! D

It was a very easy recipe, however I was disappointed in the grainy texture and I tasted more sugar than peanut butter in each bite.  Not the peanut butter cookie I had hoped for, but not to say that this won't be someone else's favorite cookie recipe.  Good luck!

These cookies were alright, but i prefer the ones with flour more. But you never know till you try. They turned out good, I would make them again for kids or if I didn't have flour on hand. Super easy and fast.

Yay! This is only the second cookie recipe I've made from scratch and they were a sucess. Perfectly soft and chewy. I too added 1 teaspoon of vanilla. What a cheap and easy treat. This is a great starter recipe for children who want to learn to cook! Enjoy!

I know I am in the minority here, but these were way too peanut buttery and they were a little too chewy.  They got stuck in my teeth.  They are just not what I think of when I think of a peanut butter cookie.  I think maybe if they had some chocolate chips or something in them that would help balance out the peanut butter.

Good and really easy, used costco organic peanut butter, white sugar, and a touch of vanilla. Did not give it a five because I like cookies to be chewy and moist, this cookie was fragil, not chewy and slightly moist.

Was worried, since there were so few ingredients, but they were sooooo good. Added the 1/2 tsp. of baking powder and 1 stp. of vanilla as other reviewers suggested. They were even better the next day!

Terribly greasy. They flattened out and oozed with grease. Nothing like a peanut better cookie should be. I used Kraft light BP and it ended up just being a waste of peanut butter. I would have preferred it on toast.

this recipe is not recommended. they don't cook or taste well. i'm not sure what to tell you to fix this recipe other than maybe adding flour? this will defeat the whole purpose. but flour is good. so who cares. :)

Loved this recipe!  I am newly diagnosed with Diabetes, and I have a sweet tooth!  So I used splenda instead too, and low fat peanut butter.  They turned out outstanding!  I did add a touch of vanilla and doubled the recipe, but it was great!  So nice to know I don't have to give up everything that tastes great!  I love these, they are so yummy and peanut buttery.  Great recipe, thanks!

Wow...these are awesome.  My boyfriend and I are avid weight lifters and cannot eat a lot of carbs, so I used 1/2 c white splenda, 1/4 c brown sugar splenda (thanks reviewers for this tip), 2 tsps vanilla, and 1/2 c egg beaters.  Also used organic peanut butter from Giant Eagle (local grocer).  I made little cookies that are now a go to after hard workouts or a treat on cheat day.

THANK YOU so much for offering this protein packed, low carb cookie.

I hate to say it, but I was disappointed in the taste and texture.  Most of the reviews were so positive.  I added vanilla as some mentioned, the dough was easy to work with, I added kisses on some, they just were oily, and flavorless.

With no changes at all, this was the best batch of peanut butter cookies I've ever tasted. Super easy, even for children and the ingredients are always on hand in my house.

wowwww for the amount of effort and time you put into these, they're amazing! i followed the original recipe to the letter, and immediately ate one right from the oven. at first they were kinda mushy and weird, and i was so disappointed, BUT then when they cooled down, OH MAN.

I thought they were good... I made them for a child in my daycare who can't eat gluten when I was making chocolate chip cookies for everyone else. He didn't like them and neither did anyone else in the daycare because they were "too dry like dried up peanut butter and too peanut buttery". I recommend adding something to moisten them up a bit, but there's really nothing you can do to make it taste less peanut buttery... but they are peanut butter cookies after all!!

I thought these were great!
I also used half Splenda and half Splenda brown sugar blend. They are so yummy and smell so good when baking! Mine didn't turn out very pretty. I think I smashed them too much!

I told my husband I wanted PB cookies and he laughed. Why? Because he reminded me that although I am a pretty good cook, I make the worst PB Cookies -- EVER! He can no longer claim this. We both LOVED these cookies. Thanks!!!

Honestly, it took me a couple tries to get the timing just right on the oven and not barely burn them into being bitter, but they are great when you get it perfect. Very rich, but isn't that exactly on the mark when you want a peanut butter cookie, anyway? I give these a high five.

Holly Cow! These are the best! So simple and soooo very good. I am on a low gluten diet and I was craving something sweet and came across this. I think this is the best peanut butter cookie I have ever had. I didn't read previous reviews until after I already made these but next time I will try it with have brown sugar and some vanilla. Thank you for posting this recipe.

The flavor is excellent but the texture leaves something to be desired.  They are very grainy, maybe using a simple sugar syrup in place of the sugar will work to improve this issue. I will have to try it that way before I decide about these cookies.

For a quick simple easy and possibly sugar free cookie, they are good. However they are not the type of cookie i like, you can not make these chewy , they have this crumbly chewy texture but not the type of cookie i am used to. I did use splenda and a bit of brown sugar.

These have great PB taste but they fall apart when you pick them up. I used splenda instead of sugar and they still tasted great. Baked up and kept their shape very well. Hubby is on a low arb diet and these are going to be a great treat for him. The only thing that didn't make it 5 stars was the texture. Way too soft and crumbly and they fall apart.

Big hit in my house.  I love the simplicity.  I added the dash of vanilla and dash of baking soda after doubling it.  I also did the 1/2 and 1/2 sugar alteration. Thanks for those suggestions.

These cookies are very tasty and rich, I added the vanilla that was recommended by other reviews. I did not have brown sugar so I just used the white. This is a easy quick way to make peanut butter cookies!

DELICIOUS! I HATE peanut butter cookies, I made these for my mom, as she often diets off of flour, and I tried them and I LOVE them! They are great! So simple and so tasty! I did 1/2 a cup white sugar and 1/2 a cup brown, and a small splash of vanilla. 
Be sure to let these cool completely before moving them, otherwise they crumble apart easily.
I followed the exact recipe amounts and my batch made 22 cookies!

First batch I baked for 12 minutes because 8 was too little. They were soo hard and too icky to eat. The other ones I baked for 10 and it was good. It's good recipe to quickly fill your peanut butter cookie cravings, but if you have flour and eggs please use the traditional recipe. Cutting out ingredients loses that great home made taste.

My son loved this recipe. My hubby did not. Said it was too gritty. So I did what others said and used 1/2 cups of brown sugar, white sugar, and powdered sugar. Hubby loved it. Son did not. Just goes to show you can't make everyone happy.

I of course can't make a recipe w/out adding something!  I took advice of others, did 1/2c brown sugar and 1/2c white sugar. I added a pinch of baking soda, 1.5t mexican vanilla and about 1/2c of chocolate chips.  They were chewy and delicious! I will certainly make them again!

this recipe became very chewy like caramel.  I had problems baking it enough in the oven, however, like one person said, I used half white sugar and half brown sugar.  That could have been the problem.  I will try it once again with only white.  I'm not into Splenda at all.

I followed the recipe exactly.  I thought these were pretty good just not like a traditional peanut butter cookie.  They were easy to make and had good flavor.  If you are looking for a traditional recipe, I would try something else.

I made these...most importantly it was easy enough for my husband to make these. He actually added a little bit of baking cocoa and a couple drizzles of caramel...I was almost jealous because they were much better then mine. I like to think I had something to do it.

Ok...the batter was pretty good-especially when i added vanilla-but when i got to the whole baking part, the cookies not only spread horribly but melted and i was left with gobs of peanut butter. I think that maybe, the kind of peanut butter is VERY IMPORTANT. Creamy or greasy peanut butter apparantly is not to be used for this recipe.

i had a killer craving for peanut butter cookies one night that just would not go away. i needed something really easy because i didn't have a lot of ingredients (and only half a jar of PB) on hand. these cookies absolutely did the trick!!! they were delicious!!! i wish i could figure out a way to make them a little less crisp, though. i added about a teaspoon of honey to mine.

I was really skeptical of this recipe wondering how it could taste like the peanut butter cookies I grew up on but I decided to give it a try. I was surprised on how "normal" they tasted! Even days later they were soft and delicious! Others have asked me for the recipe and are shocked to know it only has three recipes.
Way to go!

these cookies are very sweete, with the cup of sugar in it, it was like eating candy.  try only 1/2 cup of sugar or splenda, then you have a very nice cookie snack that remains healthy.

I have been making this version for yearsand it is one of my favorites. It is super easy. I can whip up a batch of theses cookies for my family in minutes. I would give it six stars if I could. Everyone loves them and when they ask for the recipe can't believe there is no flour in them. Try them once and it is hard to go back to any other peanut butter cookie..

These cookies are really great! I'm making Christmas cookies and I'm running low on flour, so these were ideal. In order to keep the cookies from sticking to the fork when I pressed them down, I dipped it in granulated sugar. I added a dash of vanilla, 'cause I always add vanilla when recipes don't call for it. I hope these are as good tomorrow.

These cookies are super! I added 1 tsp. of vanilla and a handful of chocolate chips, and I baked them for less time than recommended- only 5-6 minutes at 350.
They look uncooked in the middle but slightly brown around the edges when I took them out of the oven, and I let them cool completely on the baking sheet before attempting to remove them. 
They were soft in the middle and chewy.
YUMM!! 

If you like PB, you will love this recipe.

So super easy. instead of regular PB I used the new Peanut Butter and Co's (I think that's the company's name) Dark Chocolate and Peanut Butter and use 1/2 cup of sugar. The cookies were delicious, but we ended up calling them dog poo cookies.

This is the peanut butter cookie recipe I have always used- I originally found it in a Tupperware cookbook.  It is absolutely delicious and doesn't require all the fuss of a recipe with flour and lots of other ingredients!  This is definitely one recipe you can commit to memory :)  My only tip is that I like to flatten the cookies using the bottom of a drinking glass dipped in granulated sugar! They are also super cute with holiday sprinkles on them!

I gave this recipe 5 stars because it's so simple & user friendly.  There have been other PB cookies that I've felt tasted better & had a better cookie consistency... but these are definitely first runner up!  As many reviewers already noted, the cooking time has to be increased.  I baked mine for 13 - 15 minutes and let them cool on the cookie sheets before removing (less breakage that way).  A popular variation is to use the 'Dark Chocolate Dreams' peanut butter from Peanut Butter & Co... the end result is a chocolately peanut butter cookie that goes super well with a tall glass of milk!  Mmmm!

These were fabulous!  A god-send for gluten intolerant people.  Fresh-ground peanut butter is a must.  I found that I liked them smashed down quite thin with a fork if eating while they were hot, but left thick after the fork criss-cross for the left-overs so they were still a bit soft.  Great with milk (cow, soy, rice), and milk is a must if you can’t keep your hands away from them, as I couldn’t.

I found these to be only "OK", perhaps too much hype from all the glowing reviews.  I have to admit I was pretty disappointed.  Not sure if PB brand makes a difference.  I was excited because I had all the ingredients on hand.  I used Trader Joes natural chunky PB (the kind with the oil layer on top that you have to stir in) along with Trader Joes organic white sugar and Trader Joes Organic Vanilla and of course the egg.  I have to say, mediocre at best.  I am willing to try again with a different PB brand and hopefully will get better results.

I made these with my home made almond butter - much healthier due to no hydrogenated oils. The dough was too moist, so I added 1/2 c. oatmeal that was ground in the food processor. The dough was still quite sticky, but I proceeded to bake them anyway. I found to bake them at a slightly lower temperature for about 12 to 15 minutes. That way the center was not so doughy. My husband thought they were great.

These cookies were alright. I was looking to make them diabetic-friendly so I subbed 1.5 cups Splenda for the sugar. I also added 1 tsp vanilla. 6 mins. in the oven was just about perfect. Be careful taking them off the cookie sheet though - they are quite delicate.

Wow, who knew cookies could be so fast and easy to make!  My husband & I were just sitting around tonight and he said, "I wish I had some peanut butter cookies...can you make some?"  So I found this recipe and just whipped them right up from the few ingredients I have on hand!  I added 1 t. of vanilla.  They taste wonderful.  Next time I will flatten them some and make the famous fork marks for authenticity and bake them longer, about 12-14 minutes.  Yummy!

Easy and Delicious!
I used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white and since I was (gasp!) out of vanilla...I put a splash of almond extract instead.

My daugter and I gobbled them up last night and she just begged me to make more...since I'm a softie...I'm on my way to the kitchen!

Thanks!

First of all, I have no idea where the 6 servings came from. I made medium sized cookies and I still got 15! They took almost 20 minutes to cook. I definitely would follow other reviewers and wait for them to cool before removing them from the pan. Otherwise they crumble everywhere. My husband loved them-he asked me to make them for his students for their Christmas treat.

I think I made them a little too big, or maybe didn't let them cool long enough, because the bottoms fell out of my cookies when I tried to big them up.  Did I need to poke them with a fork?  Maybe my shape was too round from the start.  I don't know!

These are the best and easiest peanut butter cookies I've ever made!  I doubled the recipe and used natural peanut butter.  I also substituted Splenda (half Splenda for baking and half of the Splenda brown sugar blend) for the sugar and added peanut butter chips.  They were a bit fragile as I moved them to the cooling rack so I had to be careful.  But once they cooled they were perfect.  No one would ever guess that they are flourless and I will definitely make these again.

I have been making PB cookies like this since I first started baking and have found that if you dont flatten them with the fork and make them a little bigger they turn out way better, softer to be exact. (Everyone LOVES all my cookies because they are always soft and chewy even days after I make them, and thats how I do that with these.)

Allergy Alert- I sub. Soybutter for the peanut butter and it worked very well. Everyone really liked them except for my son who has the allergy, I think he is so well trained to avoid peanut butter that the very thought and taste made him sick. I also added choc.chips. Very yummy

This recipe was ok. It is VERY easy, and only 3 ingredients, so I am not complaining. The cookies were good,  but I've made better. I would sugest drinking a nice cold glass of milk with it. (;

I love this recipe because it's one of the few that I have all the ingredients for at any time. I found the full cup of sugar to be too sweet so I cut it back to 3/4 cup and used Natural Crunchy PB and it was perfect. A glass of milk should be an ingredient too... not for cooking but for when you're eating them. :)

It's a pretty good cookie when your watching your flour intake. I used a cup of Splenda and a splash of vanilla instead of white sugar. They fall apart easily making them this way but if you're watching your flour AND sugar intake just being able to eat what tastes like a cookie and still being good for you is good enough! Just have something cold to wash them down 'cause they are HEAVY!

The one cup of peanut butter and one cup of sugar makes plenty of cookies that are 2 inches round, i doubled it and found out the hard way how many it makes, have fun with them and put chocolate chips on top and spell things out, i did my girlfriend's name as a surprise for her and she loved them.

I guess I am a minority b/c I do not favor this recipe.  It took the cookies longer than 8 minutes to get done.  Even then, the texture was sandy.  This was sweet, gooey, and not the peanut butter cookie I was craving.  The presentation of this cookie was awful.  The cookies were very greasy;  I used Jiffy.  I think flour would have soaked up some of the oil from the peanut butter.  I will not make this cookie again.  I think I will try to find a recipe that has high ratings as well as FLOUR.

These were great!  I doubled the recipe and made them with natural peanut butter and everyone loved them.  I also rolled them into balls before baking, and stuck a reese's pb cup into each after they came out of the oven.  YUM!

I used an all-natural unsweetened peanut butter, still found this recipe way too sweet for my liking. Also baked in the oven for 12 minutes.

Fantastic! I used Splenda instead of sugar and some vanilla essence and they turned out excellent, like the texture of Mrs. Fields cookies. I also made a batch wit 1/4 cup of almond meal and these ended up tasting more like scones!

These cookies were amazing! I've made peanut butter cookies before and they always turned out hard and crunchy. But these turned out perfect, they were soft and chewy. Thanks for the recipe!

I added the vanilla and used half a cup of brown sugar and half a cup of white sugar.  They were wonderful.

I've used this recipe so many times...always a huge hit. It works well for me with crunchy and smooth peanut butter, organic or regular...it's always good!

Love this recipe! Just 3 ingredients! I bake for 12 minutes at 350 and have never had a problem. Been making them for years. I do use 2/3 cup white sugar and 1/3 cup brown sugar.

Excellent!
Easy recipe, took 5 minutes. I followed exactly and used reduced fat chunky style peanut butter. I baked for 8 minutes. I had a bag of dark chocolate eggs in the freezer leftover from Easter. After 8 minutes I stuck one in the middle of each cookie and baked for 2 more minutes. YUM!

I've made these for years, I have a child allergic to wheat. I always double the batch. Sometimes I add walnuts, or use crunchy peanut butter. okay to use 1/2 brown sugar, and 1/2 white sugar. They always come out great.

This is great! I have made these several times and they always turn out great. Make sure you add the vanilla...it makes a big difference. Also, I have made these with  Splenda for Baking and it is great (I use 3/4 cup) Either way, these are great. Thanks for the recipe!

Today I had cravings for peanut butter so I searched for a recipe and found this one. Very good cookies. Very simple to make and out of the oven in a jiffy. Didn't change a thing except using crunchy peanut butter, love it. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

These are really good, I put chunks of chocolate in them. They took about 4-5 minutes longer to cook than stated in recipe. These are like pure peanut butter, baked! Very good, very rich.

These were just like eating a sugary glob of peanut butter...tasty, but too much for me. If you make these, make them small so they get done. I also had to lower the temp to 325. Thanks though, it took care of my sugar craving!

Just tasted one of these cookies and I must say they are absolutely the best!! I doubled the recipe, used chunky peanut butter and also added 1 cup chocolate chips and increased the cooking time by two minutes like some of the reviews said, and they are just magnificent!! Will definately make again soon!!

Surpising good. If I didn't make them, I wouldn't know there wasn't flour in them. The only thing is, I had to bake much longer than the time given. At 8-10 minutes, they were very undone and tasted terrible. At 25 minutes, they firmed up like regular cookies.

These are extremely easy and give you that cookie fix in a pinch. I used crunchy peanut butter as that's all I had, definitely needed more time to bake. I would say I baked them around 12 or so minutes. The bottoms were nicely golden brown. A chewy lovely texture but a tad on the sweet side. I would reduce the sugar to maybe 3/4 cup next time. Will make again for sure!

I love the taste of these...I can't believe they can be so good for such little effort.  I did add 1 teaspoon of vanilla and I also had to bake them more than 8 minutes.  I just put them back in the oven for another 2 min and they have baked already for 10...so I would think the bake time is 12 minutes.  They did come out pretty flat, although I did the fork thing.  They are still delicious.

I don't like peanut butter cookies. My husband loves them though so I made this recipe for him.  Figured it was a good yield size for one person over a few days. However, I thought they tasted so good I'm planning on making more. Now I know the reason I never liked pb cookies, they were always too crumbly for me, these were perfect. Not too mention very easy! My husband hasn't had a chance to try them yet but I know he will love them.

I can trace my roots on this recipe back to 7th grade Home Ec class. A classic! These are especially nice to make with children and novice bakers. Thanks!

Yummy dough to eat and the cookies were good right out of the oven. . .but, if they have to sit for any period of time I would go with another recipe because the ones that sat did not get eaten--too dry and crumbly.

I got this recipe from one of my health teachers in school years ago and it has been my favorite peanut butter cookie so far.. They're always so delicious and easy to make especially w/ little kids.

Wow. This is so easy and so delicious. I did not know what to expect from such a simple recipe. I used 1/2 cup Splenda and a teaspoon of vanilla extract. First, I dropped them down as balls, then I flattened with a fork in crisscross pattern. All I have to say is, you definetly have to be a peanut butter lover and have a sweet tooth for these cookies.

I made this recipe years ago when my daughter was small.  I had not made it in years and could not remember the recipe..I found it! The only thing I did different was to roll the dough balls in sugar and flatten inthe criss crossx pattern.  A co-worker wanted really good chewy PB cookies..and I know this was it!  I can't wait to take them to her tomorrow!

A great peanut butter cookie.  I pressed Hershey's PB kisses into half the batch and they were great that way too.  I didn't have a sandy texture at all.  Mine got moister the next day.
Super easy and super yummy.

I could not believe how easy it was to make this! Not the same texture as the traditional chewy peanut butter cookie, slightly grainy, but still yummy!

Wow! I thought these cookies were the perfect peanut butter cookie! Only thing I did differently was roll each cookie and then press with a fork in a criss-cross shape. They flattened nicely and cooked evenly in about 10 minutes. I will make these again and again! Thanks!!

These cookies taste very impressive for only having three ingredients.  These aren't my normal peanut butter cookies, but these are the ones I make with my 5 year old son.  It's easy for him to count and measure the ingredients and it's a quick mix and bake.

I guess I'm in the minority here -- I thought these were just okay.  Maybe I did something wrong, but I didn't care for the sandy texture of these cookies -- I felt like I was chewing on sugar.  Which I guess I was.

Moist with tons of flavor!  I used Wheylow (sugar substitute) instead of real sugar and no one could tell the difference!  Excellent cookies.

Very, very easy to make and great because of the limited amount of ingredients. My only concern was the baking time. I had to keep them in for about 11 mins or so. Otherwise they were great!

DELICIOUS!  This is simple perfection! I have no idea why people add soda to this recipe, without flour to keep the soda in "check" the cookie will run all over the sheet, adding salt is silly because your PB has tons of sodium in it.  I did add a tsp of vanilla though...YUMMY, the whole family loved them.

These are actually pretty great!  What I love most is how easy they are to make, and how little ingredients go into it.  If you love peanut butter cookies this is a great recipe to try.  They definitely are very peanut-buttery!

YUM! This satisfied the peanut butter craving quickly! I did make the suggested alterations: add 3 T flour, 1/2 tsp. salt, 1 tsp. baking soda, and 1 tsp. vanilla extract, then I added a few drops of butter extract. I also used half crunchy and half creamy peanut butter. Make sure you spray your pan first. PS-Good luck trying to save some for the kids

I don't know if I'm doing something wrong, but I can never get these cookies to turn out.  They run all over the cookie sheet as they cook and turn hard right out of the oven.  The 3 stars is for the dough.  That is yummy enough to eat on its own.

I really like these!  I rolled them and did the criss-cross with a sugared fork, baked for 8 minutes exactly.  I made about 1 inch balls, so I got about 30 cookies.  They are very flat and chewy which works for me, I like them that way.  Also added some vanilla like another person suggested.

The biggest hit of all the cookies I made that xmas. I've made this recipe at thousand times since first getting it from here. The peanut butter I found to be better suited for this was cheap peanutbutter where it is only sweetend with corn syrup. read the ingredients on the brand to find out. 

Unsweetend peanut butter it turned out nasty, sugar sweetend was way out sweet the above cornsyrup sweetend, Just right!

It is also the only pb cookie I've ever liked.

I didn't have pnut butter so I subbed natural almond butter, 1 cup splenda since I can't have sugar, added 1/2 tsp almond extract, dash vanilla extract and a scoop of stevia to bring up the sweetness (trader joes has the best by KAL) and cooked it 7 minutes. My friends at work liked them for the south beach diet, but some recommended nixing the stevia (I happen to like the taste). They were a little crumbly so I'll cook them for less time since my oven runs hotter than most. I'll try the peanut butter version next time. Thanks much for the recipe.

I was a little doubtful about this recipe, but I read all the positive feedback and asked myself "Why not?"

The cookies turned out very soft and crumbly. I left them in the oven for atleast 10-15 minutes, unsure wether they were cooked or not. I found them little bit too dry (Yes --you do need a lot of milk with these!) but my parents enjoyed the cookies! The taste was alright, I used about half the amount of sugar since I found it to be a bit too much when measuring up. Good cookies when you take the simplicity into consideration! I'll most likely make these again, maybe I'll add some chocolate chips or vanilla extract next time.

I made these in a toaster oven, watching through the window to see when they looked  "done".  The first batch I made by dropped teaspoonful, and they didn't get cooked through all the way, so for the next batch I pressed each cookie down with a fork, which worked much better.  These cookies got crunchy extremely fast.  Good for a quick snack, maybe not for company.

Interesting recipe.  I gave this a try because we wanted cookies, but didn't have butter or shortening and really didn't want to go to the store.  This was really easy and of course had all ingredients on hand.  I was not too impressed, but I did use an organic peanut butter with less sugar than normal and no hydrogenated oil, which might have made a difference had I used regular peanut butter.  My kids did like it and I will make again if they request it.  Maybe I will make them make it, it's so easy.

I wanted cookies, but didn't feel like making them - so this was the perfect EASY recipe. I doubled the recipe, dropped by tsp. and baked each batch for 11-12 minutes. The taste was a bonus. I would not say that these are the best I have ever had (I have a to die for peanut butter cookie recipe), but I will make these often. Between the ease and the taste, you just can't go wrong. Thanks for super family pleasing, simple recipe.

GREAT COOKIE! 
I did add 2 tbs of flour to these and I tried them as the recipe says, they are still better when flattened by a fork. For some reason, they taste better when cooked that way. I added mini choc chips to them too and they were gone in a day! They stay real fresh too, i have made them more than once. SUCH a good quick recipe. In fact, Im gunna go make them now!! :)

I was very skeptical with these.  Ease alone warrants a high rating.  I thnk I might've made my cookies too big, because they baked for 11 minutes, and still were rather mushy in the middle.  I won't fault the recipe though, because I do like big cookies.  Definately worth making again!

For those of you with children who like to help in the kitchen, this recipe is very kid friendly.  My 3 and 5 year olds had fun rolling the balls and pressing down with the potatoe masher to create criss cross design. One of the best peanut butter cookies we ever baked and definitely the simplest.

I'm doing a secret santa at school and I was stuck! I figured a great gift for someone you hardly know is a box of various baked goods. I was a little worried when these came out of the oven. They were really, REALLY soft. If you take them off the tray too soon they are sure to fall apart. But after a few minutes cooling they got harder... and man are they good! 

I'm looking forward to making these again and adding a few other ingrediants.

These are without a doubt the best peanut butter cookies I've ever had, without all the work!!  I couldn't make them fast enough for the kids!  I rolled them and used a fork to criss-cross them and they came out beautiful.  I did however have to bake them about 10 minutes instead of 8.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

Sorry, but I didn't like these at all. I followed the recipe exactly and they didn't turn out well. They were flat and chewy. Even my 5 year old who will eat anything with sugar turned his nose up at these.

These cookies are excellent and so easy to make! I rolled them into small balls and pressed them down with a fork for the classic criss-cross pattern. They are very easy to work with and tasted very peanut buttery. I think I'll try leaving them in balls next time and see how much they retain their shape. Thanks Stephanie!

Ok, I was being lazy but wanted something sweet so I remembered this recipe. I didn't think it would work, even though I read the reviews. I was quite suprised. These were not the best peanut butter cookies I ever had, but they were pretty good and easy. They were pretty sugary, but definately will make them again.

These cookies are really good!  They did not come out crumbly, too pasty, too rich, or too gritty.  I used Skippy Super Chunk Peanut Butter.  I added the one teaspoon of vanilla extract.  I food-processed the sugar for 30 seconds to make it finer to avoid the grittiness.  I squeezed the dough into the recommended 1" balls.  Rolling the dough caused it too come apart, most likely due to the nuts.  I baked at the given temperature for 10 minutes.  You should lessen the time if you are looking for a more gooey cookie.  Mine came out chewy.  I let them cool for 5 minutes on the pan.  They did not crumble when I moved them to the cooling rack.  They were actually pretty easy to maneuver.  This is possibly due to my squeezing the dough into balls.  I managed to yield 28 cookies.

great as is, but I tried a neat variation that tastes great and looks pretty. I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 dark brown sugar, rolled into 1" balls, then pressed my thumb into each and filled the indentation with a little dollop of jam - watch out, it spreads (I used strawberry "Simply Fruit" and it worked fine), baked for 10 minutes, cooled for 5 minutes on the pan then moved to a rack to cool completely. These are sooo good! I might do these for my next cookie exchange - so easy! PB&J in cookie form.

WOW is all I can say!!! I thought these would come out like candy, but they seem like "real" PB cookies! I got about 15 cookies out of this recipe. I just shaped the dough like small hamburger patties, & I did bake them a little longer & let them cool on the sheet a bit. Used crunchy Whole Foods kid's PB.(natural) This is perfect the way it is. What a great find- yummy easy cookies with 3 ingredients!!! Thanks so much!

These are crumbly but great if you are in the mood for a peanut butter fix. Also, they are very easy to make.

I used Splenda instead of sugar to cut down on calories, makes for an interesting flavor.  My boyfriend loved them, but he eats peanut butter right from the jar.  =0)

These were good and very simple to make. My three-year-old "baked" them all by himself! He loved them and I thought they were ok. A little heavy for me, one was more than enough for me to reach my peanut butter quota for the week! Butit was a very fun and easy project to do with my son on a rainy day, he was so proud of himself, and he gobbled them up-definitely a keeper.

WOW, I was very skeptical, as I have tasted many gluten free cookies since members of my family have celiac disease.  These were incredible, in fact I think I like them better than my normal peanutbutter cookie recipe.  I followed the advice and added a dash of vanilla and split my sugar to 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar.  I also used reduced fat pb.  These are wonderful, If you know of anyone who is gluten intolerant, please pass this recipe on to them.

I just came across these, whipped them up and voila- I will never make another kind of peanut butter cookie. So easy and wonderful. Makes 12. I followed other reviewers suggestions and added a dash of vanilla, 1/2 c. brown sugar and 1/4 c. white! Thanks so much for an easy dessert!

I altered this recipe a bit according to one review. I used 1/4 white sugar & 1/2 brown sugar & I used a dash of vanilla with 3 tablespoons of flour, as well as topping the cookies with a hersey kiss(left over from the holidays). I also cooked the cookies for about 12 minutes (too chewy at 8 mins). They were delicous. So easy as a last minute dessert. Will make again.

The cookies were very good. I had a craving for peanut butter cookies but I didn't have all the ingredients needed for most recipes. The only thing I changed was I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I also had to bake them a little longer then 8 minutes.

I didn't like these cookies enough to make them again.  I used natural peanut butter (no sugar added) and used 1 Tbs flour and added 1/2 tsp vanilla.  The flavor was ok, but the consistency was off.  I could never tell if they were actually cooked.

You talk about sweet!  These made my teeth ache.  I followed the recipe as posted, but added 1 tsp. of vanilla extract.  Next time I'll try the brown sugar/white sugar combo.
Nice easy recipe, probably better for little kids, but it still hit the spot.  One and a half cookies and I'm set for the rest of the night as far as my sweet tooth is concerned. Thanks! :)

5 stars for "easy"!  4 stars for flavor!!  Kids loved them and enjoyed helping to make them.  I made the recipe as written, except used 1/2 white, 1/2 brown sugar.  Very good!  I will try a total of 3/4 cup sugar next time.  Thanks for a great, easy cookie recipe!!

I added three semi-sweet chocolate chips to the top of each cookie...made them interesting and worked great. Also...besides being easy...the dough was great to work with...an easy to handle dough. I have arthritis in my hands and dough can be troublesome to work with. This was easy and the cookies were fabulous!!!!!

I made these cookies when my boyfriend was craving peanut butter cookies, but I did not have any baking soda.  I made this cookie as suggested by earlier reviews - 1 tsp vanilla, half white and half brown sugar and flour.  I used only 1 tbs of flour as it was becoming too thick, possibly because I used super chunky peanut butter.  I rolled them into 1 inch balls and criss crossed them with a fork.  I baked them only for 8 minutes and they cooked well, but were missing something... I think they are missing more of a sugary flavor.  Next time I might try all white sugar and no flour.  They just do not have the consistency of a true peanut butter cookie and are not as sweet - kind of bland and flat tasting!

I made these with my 3 1/2 year old son last night and they were super easy!  I did take the advice of others and added 3 TBS flour, though.  Baked them slightly longer (maybe 9 1/2 minutes).  I might try them w/out the flour though and see what happens.  Might do another egg too for fun.  Everyone really liked them!

i thought that these were very good.  i had to cook them a few minutes longer than suggested.  I used half brown & half white sugar and added just a pinch of flour.  make sure that they are all the way cooled before removing them from the pan or they will break.  very easy to make and taste very good.  pour a BIG glass of milk before you sit down to eat these tasty little cookies! UPDATE Recently started making the following changes from time to time. Add about 3 Tablespoons of Cocoa and 1/2 cup of quick cook oats and 2 teaspoons of vanilla.

I tried this recipe because I was low on ingredients. I loved them! They were quick and easy! I used hald jiffy and hald natural PB, added a smidge of vanilla and used half white/brown sugars. The cookies were a little fragile but I upped the cooking time to 9 1/2 mins and it worked well! Definately need lots of milk with these! Two thumbs up!!

Very Sweet, I think next time I will add just a little flour. Very quick recipe!! This recipe is great when you don't have all of the ingredients to make the peanut butter cookies with flour etc.

These are really easy to make, but I have to add that that they are very sweet. I think I'll try unsweetened peanut butter next time, but this recipe is a keeper.

My daughter is allergic to wheat so this recipe is great. I usually double it (putting 1 cup white and 1 cup brown sugar). I also put a tablespoon of vanilla in. These are a huge it at my house.

Yes, these cookies are "different" and heavy, but that's what makes them so good!  They are SUPER easy to make and you have to be a real peanut butter lover to appreciate them.  They hit the spot if you're looking for something sweet!

I am a total fan of peanut butter but i do not really like these cookies because they are just like a blob of peanut butter and sugar and they are way to sweet! but they are really quick if you are in a hurry

my celiac son loves these, some days
this is ALL he will eat.  it's a great
way to get protein into him when he 
shuns meat.  the rest of our family 
likes them too.  one modification we
made for the rest of the family's
share is to put in only half of the PB
called for and make the other half 
Nutella, a hazelnut spread that is very
chocolatey.  it makes them smoother for
those of us who are used to gluten
filled, smooth textured stuff.  Nutella
may in fact be gluten-free, i haven't 
written the company to ask yet.  if 
anyone knows its gluten status and 
would care to share, maybe even the 
gluten-intolerant among us could
enjoy this version of it.
thanks for the recipe!
catherine
