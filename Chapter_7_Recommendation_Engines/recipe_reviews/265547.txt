6.24.18 Good, but a bit of a disappointment because I was looking for more Asian flavor.  They pretty much tasted like the salmon patties that I just throw together and have been making for years, so not a total disappointment. If I were to make again, Iâ€™d probably increase those Asian ingredients, the five-spice powder, soy sauce, and ginger root.  There was an empty plate at the end of the meal!  Thanks for sharing your recipe.
