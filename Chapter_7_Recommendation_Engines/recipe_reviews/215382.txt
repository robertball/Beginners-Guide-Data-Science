Apple pie is an all-time favorite and this caramel take on this classic was delicious!  It was also very easy too.  For the 9 inch deep dish pie crust I opted to use "Baker's Secret Pie Crust" from this site.  I also subbed vanilla for the rum extract as I didn't have any on hand.  I did use a little more cornstarch than called for which proved to be a good idea - there's nothing worse than taking the time to make a homemade apple pie and have it turn out runny...  This smelled wonderful in the oven and tasted even better.  It was hard to let it cool before cutting into it!  Perfect with a scoop of vanilla ice cream!

LOVED this pie.  It is just too juicy right out of the oven.  Will add more cornstarch next time.  I used Splenda sugar and brown sugar mix with excellent results.

My new go to apple pie recipe. I used vanilla instead of rum. I also used 3 tablespoons of cornstarch and two pie crusts. The only problem was I only got one piece. :(

I NEED to make this again! I made one to donate to church for a chicken BBQ so I didn't get to taste it but it smelled fabulous! I am the pie baker for family holidays so this will be the apple pie on our Thanksgiving table in a few weeks.

What an awesome pie, Easy to make and even easier to eat. The hardest part about this pie was keeping everyone away from it including me until the next day when it was going to be served with dinner.

I've made this recipe a total of ten times for family and guests.  Each time I've received positive feedback and requests for the recipe.  I've substitued different types of apples and used different carmel sauces.  Never a dissapointment!

This recipe is amazing!! I made this as my first homemade pie. And i made it for thanksgiving!! Instead of using the prepared caramel sauce from the recipe, I used caramel apple dip from the deli. Absolutely fantastic. It was such a hit that Im making two more today. Also I did an eggwash over the top which made it really look great and gave it a delicious top crust

This is by far THE best apple I have ever tasted!!!! Aside from its easy recipe, this my first pie and it was a number one hit. I have never seen a whole pie be eaten in one afternoon like this. I will bake this for every family and friend get together from now on. A scope of vanilla ice cream and this pie is a piece of heaven!

A very good pie, I liked it. However, I used a store-bought crust (Wegmans), and this did not work out so well. In my opinion, the crust was too soft and not flaky enough, maybe a bit too thin. I am sure if I had made the crust myself from scratch, I could have given the pie five stars.
I used more caramel sauce (about twice as much as the recipe calls for), as others suggested, and it came out very sweet. I used Macintosh apples (7 smaller ones), and piled the filling in a big heap, knowing it would cook down and result in a nice pie. I put a lattice crust on top, allowing some of the liquid from the apples to evaporate.
My suggestion is if you like your pie really sweet, make it as the recipe says. If you like it less sweet, reduce the sugar, or even leave out the 1/2 cup and double the caramel sauce.
I also used 3 Tbsp corn starch, and the pie was a bit runny as long as it was hot, so I drained about 2 Tbsp of liquid, and when it had cooled down, it was just the right amount. Don't drain all the liquid, as this will result in a dry filling.
I am sure I'll make the pie again, but use a different crust.

I don't like apple pie.  I LOVE this apple pie.  It turns out absolutely AMAZING.  This is getting RAVE reviews everywhere I take it.   I don't know that I have ever made apple pie (since I don't like it) yet I have made 9 of these pies in the last 4 weeks.  I will be making many more of these.

This is my go to recipe. This apple pie is always a crowd favorite. I do use 4 tbsp of cornstarch as mentioned by the other reviewers. Other than the cornstarch, that is the only change I make. It is a well balanced recipe with all the homey feelings!

Followed the advice of some of the comments and tripled the cornstarch... It turned out perfectly. I love this pie, my mom took it to an office potluck and barely got a taste, and I had to make another just so I got a chance to try it. I used homemade caramel and it turned out really well.

This recipe is very good. We used 3 Tbsp of corn starch and it was still slightly runny.  Next time we will use 4 Tbsp. We also used extra caramel sauce when serving.

I loved it but made some changes.  I added 3 tbs of corn starch.  I used 2 crusts, and I didn't have pumpkin pie spice, so I used 1/4 tsp of cardamon, 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.  It was definitely one of the best pies I ever made!!

I think a bit more cornstarch will help make it less liquidy next time

This is a really good pie.  I have made it twice and both times it did come out runny, but the flavor was still good.  I drained some of the juice and would spoon some over each piece of pie as I served it.  It was a big hit with all my company and my non eating apple pie husband.  Great recipe!!

Fabulous pie. I used apple pie spice instead of pumpkin spice and used about 6 T of caramel sauce. I should have used more with the amount of apple I ended up with. But it was still great. I used a top pie crust instead of the crumb topping, personal preference. Will make this again.
