These are a new family favorite in my house! I made using gluten free all purpose flour and I forgot the lime but these are tasty without it. I had no texture issues, my waffles came out perfect.

1.14.17  Didn’t cook up as well as I hoped, little bit on the soggy side, maybe because of the moist sweet potato??  Don’t know, I followed the instructions to the letter, but I prefer a waffle with a lighter texture and a crisper exterior.  But that’s not to say that we didn’t enjoy them, they were plenty tasty.

They were real good but didn't get crisp, rather stayed soggy.
