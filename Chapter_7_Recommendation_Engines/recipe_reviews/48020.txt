Love this idea, and it was easy and quick, but the filling was not great.  The croutons soaked up all the dressing so it was not "creamy".  Next time I will omit the croutons and add other veggies such as diced red pepper or carrots.

My husband really liked this. The measures are off, though! If you're only supposed to put 1/2 cup into each triangle, there are 4 triangles, yet you need 3 cups of cut-up chicken? Obviously made too much for the 4 triangles, so you can cut back the chicken to 2 cups. The taste was okay. Would have liked a bit more zip to it somehow. Very easy to make and the presentation was different than a typical meal.

I made some changes:
I did not add the frozen peas & onions or the croutons. I used red & green bell pepper, red onion broccoli, ranch dressing and chicken. I really enjoyed the flaky pie crust. I used both (pie crusts) and froze the leftovers for lunches(the re-heat makes it a little soggy though).

I’m giving this recipe 5 stars for the idea alone. I changed the ingredients somewhat to make it taste more like a traditional chicken pot pie and it was WONDERFUL. Here’s what I used:

3 cups cooked, chicken (I boiled boneless skinless breasts)
1 ½ cups crushed Ritz crackers 
3/4 cup cream of chicken soup
salt and pepper to taste
2 refrigerated prerolled pie crusts 
1 cup diced carrots cooked until somewhat firm

I combined the mixture as original recipe stated. 
The only difference in the rest of the preparation is that I used 2 crusts both cut in half, spooned in mixture, and folded crusts into a pocket. Makes 4 large turnovers.
          I love this recipe!

This was wonderful! I changed some of the ingredients though- I used the cooked grilled chicken strips, one can of VegAll and a can of Cream of Chicken soup--added a pinch of spices and it is a keeper in my household!!!!!-rebecca carpenter

This turned out a little dry, next time I will use less croutons and more ranch dressing.  Otherwise the taste was great, and my kids loved it.

These are very easy to make and they are tasty - my husband really likes them. He likes to heat the leftovers in the microwave and take it with him for a to-go breakfast! As another reviewer noted, there is way too much filling if you follow the recipe.
