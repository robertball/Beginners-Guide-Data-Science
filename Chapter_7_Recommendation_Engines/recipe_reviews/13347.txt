The soup is good. The instructions, on the other hand, need some clarifing.  Putting flour in a pan & cooking it til "pasty"?  What's that all about?  I think most of us realize the idea was to make a roux.  Anyway, it was delicious with only 4 slices of bacon.  I would definately make this again.

This was just about THE best potato soup I've ever had!  My husband raved about it.  The only thing I added was a couple of stalks of finely chopped celery and 1 tsp of chopped garlic (I put it in just about everything, though).  
This one is definitely a keeper!!!!

Thank you for the base to a great soup. The only thing I omitted was the flour. For the instant potatoes I used 1 packet of garlic and cheddar along with 3 med size potatoes grated like hash browns, two cans of cream of celery and a little pepper.  I also only used the meat from the bacon, none of the fat and only half a med size onion.  My whole family loves it!

I made this soup for Christmas Eve and it was a big hit!  I made it exactly as written and it was delicious.  I agree, the recipe was confusing regarding the flour, but you just need to make a simple roux with the bacon grease and it will turn out fine.

Pretty good stuff & easy. I always use bacon bits- so I just saute'd the onion in a little butter, then added the flour. Then chicken broth & bacon, etc. Definitely mash the potatoes quite well in the pan,(when done)  & stir between mashings to bring up the potatoes from the bottom. Cook at least 30 minutes- maybe 35-40!

This potato soup is delicious.  I used skim milk and upped the flour to 2 tablespoons.  Very good and easy.

I really liked this soup a lot but I also agree that the instructions aren't that great. I gave it a 5 anyway because it was tasty. I topped it with cheddar cheese and chives before serving.

OMG That was awesome! I sauteed celery and some finely diced carrots with the onions. I also added 1 cup of instant mashed potatoes since I like the soup a bit thicker. I want to eat the entire pot all by myself. Super easy and tastey.

This was so good as listed! I dressed mine up a little with some sharp cheddar stirred in at the end. Also a little parsley and some garlic powder were added in with the broth. This very much reminds me of O'Charley's loaded potato soup. Very very good stuff!

Made as written, am rating as a 4 as it screams for seasoning...After eating a bowl, I went back and pureed a cup to thicken, added tons of pepper, a dash of ground mustard, some parsley and a bay leaf.  Most soup improves with time, so am going to let simmer for a couple of hours and then recheck.  This is a great starter recipe, though.  Thank you so much.

All I have to say is WOW! I'm a pretty knew cook, and I really love to try new recipes. I love potato soup, but have been kind of intimidated to try to make it. I saw this recipe and it seemed easy enough, so I gave it a go. I didn't really modify anything. I didn't have cream, so I used milk, and I also added celery to the onion/bacon mix. It has been by far, the best potato soup I've ever had. Everyone who ate it, had the same reaction. I added a little more dry mashed potato flakes to thicken it a bit more, but the recipe is perfect.

This recipe is AMAZING! I followed the recipe fairly closely, however I omitted the bacon, cooked the onions in a Tbls. of butter and used 2% evaporated milk instead of half and half to make it a bit healthier.  Also, I only had a package of garlic and chive instant potatoes on hand, but it was delish!  Thanks for this wonderful recipe, it will certainly be a regular at our house!

In spite of the bad directions this turned out GREAT!  I fried the bacon in a Dutch oven then stirred the flower into the grease then added the onion and one rib of sliced celery and one grated carrot.  Sauteed veggies for a short time then added the broth, instant potatoes and potatoes.  I did mash about half of the potatoes before adding the half and half.  The only seasoning I used was a little pepper.  This was a keeper recipe and I'll be making it again.  Thanks Pat!

I think it would be better without the potato flakes. Just use more potato and puree most of the solids at the end. I did add fennel and that was good.

I tried to follow the recipe as best I could but had to make a few dietary adjustments.  I used olive oil instead of bacon (no meat on Wednesdays & Fridays during lent); 1 Tablespoon gluten free sweet sorghum flour instead of regular; low-sodium vegetable broth, 8 smaller organic Idaho potatoes and kept the skins on.  To keep it dairy light, I mixed 1/4 cup rice milk with 1/4 cup organic dairy sour cream (so the dairy is negligible).  I tempered the dairy mix before adding.  This was delicious!  I would like to try it with leeks and bacon next time, saving a little of both for garnish.  I would also put shredded cheese on the side for anyone who can tolerate it.

This was very yummy!  I did not have any chicken broth on hand so I used a carton of brocolli soup for the broth and diluted it to have 6 cups of liquid.  Then I added 2 cups of skim milk instead of 1.

This was great.  Once I figured out that I can't cook flour in a pot until pasty.  I am a new cook.  Don't know what that is all about could someone let us newbies in on the cooking flour in a pot.  I don't know what a roux is either.  Somehow it turned out for us

I made this soup for a party (about 20 people). It was very good and kept well in the crock pot on low. One of my quests said that it was the best soup he had ever had and he travels all over. it was very easy to make which is what I look for in a recipe.

This soup was great.  The only change I made was to add 1tbs butter to the pan before adding the flour.  I topped it with cheddar cheese and sliced green onions.

Delicious!  Made twice in one week! I cooked bacon first. Removed bacon from pan and cooked onion in the remaining bacon fat. I added two tablespoons of flour and cooked for a few minutes then I added chicken broth, bacon, instant potatoes, potatoes and lots of pepper. Cooked it 45 minutes uncovered then added half and half.

We thought this was just OK.  It had a very strong chicken taste to it from all the broth.  Nex time I will play around with spices to get it to my liking.  Late in the week, I blended the soup to make mashed potatoes.  I love dishes with a dual purpose!

Very delicious soup.  I gave it a 4 because I felt the soup could use some additional seasoning.  I followed the recipe pretty close.  To make a bit more soup, I used 7 potatos, added an additional 2 cups broth, and increased the potato flakes to 1 cup.  I used a whole package of bacon, and used a bit of the grease to make the rue.  Next time I'll add some additional herbs & seasoning which should make this a 5 star recipe..Thanks Pat for the Gr8 recipe.

A really good potato soup that can easily be customized to fit your own personal preferences. For example, I added more mashed potato flakes (I like potato soup pretty thick...) and also added some finely chopped broccoli.

Added shredded carrots, white beans, & sour cream instead of half and half. Each person customized their bowls with crushed red pepper, parsley, or oregano. Fantastic. My 17 year old said she was so proud to be part of our family because of this soup.

This is so delicious!! It has become my family's new favorite meal. I use a pound of bacon, not 6 slices. We are meat lovers. Other than that I make it as directed and serve with cheddar cheese on top. Yummy!

This was not that great of soup. It tasted like instant mashed potato soup and not cream of potato soup. I ended up putting in sour cream, onion, garlic, cheese and lots of bacon. By the time i was finished it was loaded potato soup. The family liked the end result.

This soup was delicious and my kids LOVED IT!!!  The only thing is that it was just a bit salty (probably because of the bacon I used) so next time I'll be using a lower salt chicken broth.

I loved this soup! As another reviewer suggested I used skim milk and upped the flour to TBS and this recipe still felt indulgent. I also put in some frozen corn at the end and that added some great texture. After about 7 minutes my onions started to get too well done so be sure to keep an eye on them.

Great easy soup.  Very tasty....subbed cooked bacon for the ham, added shredded cheddar to the rue and a couple drops of liquid smoke.  I used two packets of Chicken Top Ramen Season because I didn't have bouillon cubes but it turned out just fine!  YUMMY!  Thank you for this recipe.

I have been making this soup for a year now.  I combine carrots, onions and celery all cut on a microplane.  It gives flavor but not color.  I also use boxed stock unless I have home made in the freezer.

This was a very simple, but wonderful recipe!  I've tried many potato soup recipes and my family voted this one the best and yes, I followed the recipe just because I had everything on hand!  I understood the recipe, but I make a lot of soups, so I understood the "pasty" part of the recipe.  Thanks for sharing this recipe - it's part of my recipe box now!

I have always loved potato soup, and this one is the best I’ve ever made! Super simple and really delicious. I guess the only change I made was that I only used one pan. After sautéing the bacon and onions, I put them aside in a bowl and added a little bit (maybe half a tablespoon) of butter to the pan. Once the butter was melted I added the flour to the pan and proceeded with the recipe as directed. This will be my go-to potato soup from now on!

I cut the recipe in half since I live alone and made three large servings. I didn't understand the roux bit with the flour and I use gluten flour anyway. I also don't eat bacon so I left that out but it was quite filling and I topped with green onion and cheddar cheese.

I used this recipe as a jumping point to salvage a bad batch of mashed potatoes.  I proceeded as directed until I got the point of adding the potatoes.  At that step I added six large scoops of the failed (lumpy, sticky) mashed potatoes.  I added the bacon and simmered.  Because of the butter and milk in the mashed potatoes I skipped the cream.  It was a hit.  Sadly, I might not be able to replicate it, but as written it will be fine.

The flavor is awesome but I like my soup a little thicker so I added some roux to thicken it.  I also would probably chop the potatoes the next time.

i am making this soup right now, for me and a friend who had some dental work done.  so far, its an easy recipe.  i did make a flour paste and added the broth to it, so that it would not be lumpy.  i am planning to mash a third of the potatoes and use it instead of the instant potatoes.  it would be great for anyone who is having trouble chewing after dental surgery.

This was a fabulous soup.  Both my husband and son loved it!!!  The directions were a bit sketchy at first with the flour and chicken broth, but then it all came together.  There was plenty leftover for lunch or dinner the next day.

This came out great very tasty.  The only issue I had was that it wasn't thick enough.  Which I'm sure has to do with the flour step that I had a problem with.  It was still really good though!!!

I was at a restaurant and had the most fabulous cream of potato soup, so I wanted to see if I could make it at home for the family.  This recipe was very easy and the entire family loved it!  Even my picky kids loved it.  Great recipe!

Easy to do once I realized the cooked flour is like a roux.  My four year old loves this recipe!

My family moans at the mention of 'soup' for dinner, but they loved this!!  I used lower-fat bacon, and it turned out wonderfully.
