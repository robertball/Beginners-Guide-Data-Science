It was fine, and definitely healthy, just a bit bland for me. I might try it with 1/4 cup of Miracle Whip instead of the greek yogurt and mayo.The 'Boats' in the title inspired me to cut the cucumber into 1/2" slices after I filled with the tuna, and make little 'boat' appetizers. I cut a small slice off the bottom so they wouldn't wobble. I think they're fun, and kids would like the little bite-size pieces. Not a bad recipe, I just think it needs a little tweak.
