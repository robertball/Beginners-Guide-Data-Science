2-24-2016  ~I never have plain yogurt around, Greek or otherwise, so I made this completely with sour cream.  Other than that I prepared this right down the list of ingredients, exactly as written.  I was encouraged at each addition, liking every ingredient in the mix.  And then I tasted it... and was unimpressed.  It tasted like a doctored up common burger sauce or Thousand Island dressing masquerading as a "Southwest" dressing, the sweetness of the ketchup very apparent and disagreeable.  Moments after I tasted it I was already planning my review, indicating this sweetness and what I might do differently, perhaps using tomato sauce or tomato paste rather than ketchup to combat the sweetness and/or adding a little hot sauce.  But by the time I used it on my salad (lettuce, slow cooked shredded chicken, sliced avocado, tomatoes, green onion, black olives and shredded Mexican-blend cheese), magic had happened!  The flavors had indeed mellowed out and combined, resulting in a complex but balanced dressing with the initial sweetness gone.  It was not only much improved, it was just right.  In fact, this was spot on, and I just can't see messing around with it at all.  DO include everything, including the cilantro, which gave this freshness and a tease of its flavor.  The dressing just wouldn't be the same (meaning as GOOD) without it.

I often wonder how something so simple can taste so incredibly good. I tasted this as a dip and quickly decided that we are having taco salads for dinner tonight with this as a dressing. This would go well on bugers, chops or anything else you can think of.

I came on-line to look for a Southwestern Style Salad Dressing. This worked out very well. After storing in the refrigerator for the flavors to meld I may find a dash of hot sauce in order, but this is very good dressing!

This dressing was very good and super easy to make. I did add more garlic and some additional spices to kick it up a notch.
The best advice I can say is let it sit in the frig for a good 24 hours.

I'm definitely in the minority here, but I thought this was just OK, and I let it sit a whole day before using. I thought it was a bit too thick as a dressing. The sweetness of the ketchup was more than I expected. Also, I felt it needed more cilantro and something else--maybe some hot sauce or cayenne pepper. It was OK on my chicken taco salad, but I kept thinking a little ranch dressing might make the salad tastier. Thanks anyway.

This is a simple Delicious recipe.  I made it for a Fajita salad.  Very refreshing on a 100 degree day.  Thanks

Phenomenal sauce I didn't use yogurt but all sour cream and I added a bit of Cajun seasoning to it.

This dressing is delicious! I was a little skeptical about adding the ketchup but the result was really great - I should mention that I used greek yoghurt so the dressing was thicker than it would have otherwise been. I diluted it with a tablespoon or so of Italian dressing and it was fine! I used it on a grilled chicken southwestern salad with black beans, avocado, tomatoes and strips of tortillas that I very lightly coated in a small amount of olive oil and baked in a 350 oven until they were crisp, around 15 minutes. They add a lot of flavor to the salad (I used romaine lettuce).

The whole family LOVED this!  Easy and very tasty- even better after sitting for several hours.  Was out of sour cream, so used all yogurt.  Nice and tangy- mmmmmmmmmmm!

This was easy to make with ingredients I had in house.  I don't like cilantro so I skipped it. I'll definitely make this again.

It was good. The cilantro was unnecessary to me in my opinion. This was a quick, easy and healthy dressing to make.

Great recipe  I love the fact that the base is Greek Yogurt.  I didn't have sour cream so just added extra yogurt and some fat free milk which made it creamier.  Had I had sour cream, I would have used it instead of milk.  This definitely is a keeper.
