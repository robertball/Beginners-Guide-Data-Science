I ended up doing mine a little different.  I simmered the ribs in water over the stove for about an hour.  Then I rubbed the salt/sugar mixture on the ribs and put on the grill for a minute or two before coating them with the bbq sauce and grilling.  They were very flavorful and probably the most tender ribs that I have made yet.  Will try on bbq chicken also.
