This recipe was awesome! I toasted the pecan chips and chopped up my grapes. Then sprinkled both on top of the cheese. That way there's some grape in every bite! It got rave reviews from my guests! Will definately make again.

I used the main idea but using what I had on hand, substituted crackers for bread, cream cheese for goat cheese and almonds for pecans.  Still great.

This recipe was a hit at a cocktail party.  I used goat cheese flavored with basil and roasted garlic and toasted the baguette before spreading the cheese.  Will definitely use this recipe again.

Very easy - but I recommend lightly toasting the bread before spreading the cheese and putting the toppings on.  I also agree with the other reviewers - chop up the grapes in tiny pieces and put a lot of them on there.  The grapes are absolutely needed to give depth and flavor to this appetizer.  I was slightly disappointed by the lack of flavor, but think it can be altered by stir frying the pecans in brown sugar/butter and using a lot of grapes.  Easy, good recipe - thanks!

Yum. Quick and easy. In fact, almost too quick. My husband didn't have a bottle of wine opened yet because he anticipated it would take longer to make. I also screwed up and actually mixed the nuts in the goat cheese. Also, I used straight goat cheese instead of the herbed kind and added more grape halves on top because it seemed like you needed a bit of sweetness with every bite.

Incredibly easy to make and they look so good! I took the advice of the one the reviewers and chopped up the grapes and that made it perfect.  Just to add one little note here: Bleu cheese and goat cheese are not the same thing.  Goat cheese is a very mild cheese, the consistency and color of cream cheese, but a thousand times better.

Delicous!  I made this per the recipe, and I loved them.  I did make another trip to the refrigerator for more grapes, but I thought this
combination was wonderful!  Thank you, Virginia!

These are delicious and so easy to make. I thought the grapes might be for decoration, but they made these fantastic. Oh, and the other party goers loved them too.

This recipe was very tasty!  I followed it exactly, and it had a lot of flavor.  I did use "candied" pecans, and they gave it a really nice sweetness.  I think it would also be good with some flavored goat cheese, maybe a herb flavor.

I loved these, especially while I was making them for my family's holiday gathering.  Unfortunately, they taste better right after the bread is toasted.  My family was hesitant to try them and I had a lot left over.

These were pretty good, but probably one of the more unpopular appetizers that I served at the wine tasting event I took them to.  However, that might be more because goat cheese is an acquired taste, soooo....yeah.  Anyways, I did change things around a little: 1) toasted the pecans first and then just mixed them in with the cheese 2) chooped up the grapes and sprinkled them on top of the spread cheese 3) added just a little dill over the top of the bites to give it some color.  Thanks for sharing!  :)

These were good.  I used toasted walnuts instead of pecans (didn't realize I was out of those until I was making this) and chopped the grapes like another person recommended.  Also made it into a layered dip that I served with thinly sliced toasted french bread slices.

After reading the revews, I toasted the baguette slices and bought pre-sweetend pecans (came in a bag labeled "Pecan Pie flavored").  I cut the grapes into quarters and put 3-4 pieces on each slice.  It was really good!  The pecans I bought were probably a little too sweet because I felt like I was eating a dessert (which was both good and bad), so I think next time I will just use plain pecans (or lightly butter/sweeten them myself).  But these were really easy to make and really good.  Other than the pecans being too sweet (which was my own fault), it was delicious.  Enjoy!

Will make again!  Even my father who would never eat something called "goat cheese" loved them (told him later).  Next time, I would really load up on the cheese.  I thought I had enough, but more would be better.

I made these last night for a get together and my guests fought over who took the (VERY FEW!) leftovers home.  I toasted the pecans in a nonstick skillet before I sprinkled them over the bread/cheese and put two cut grape halves on each piece.  DEE-LISH.

I made this for a garden party and it received rave reviews! I toasted slices of baguette, mixed a little bit of blue cheese salad dressing in with the cream cheese. I also toasted the pecans and chopped up the grapes as another reviewer suggested. It was easy and so tasty. I will definitely make these again!

Awesome in it's simplicity! I made a variety of choices along with the original recipe. Made fresh cranberry sauce to replace grapes. Blue Cheese is VERY different than Goat Cheese. I love it and added a few crumbles to the goat. Lightly toasted the baguette slices for extra crunch. May try the glazed pecan suggestion next time?

This was really good and easy.  I agree with the other reviewers.  You need to have a grape in every bite, so cutting them up into smaller pieces is much better.  I used large breadsticks and sliced and toasted them for a smaller "bite".

This was all right, simple, and it tasted great, but it's not going to impress guests. But I think it makes a great healthful snack served with whole wheat baguette. Would make it again when in a pinch.

I made these as an appetizer and everyone loved them.  Per suggestions from others, I chopped the grapes.  I believe these would 'look' better with the half grape, but chopping adds flavor to every bite!  These are very easy to make and taste delicious.

These were easy to make. I am not a goat cheese fan so I Substituted the goat cheese for cream cheese and yummy yummy! Next time I am going to make them with blue cheese. I cut up the grapes and they were a hit! I will definitely make these again. Healthy Mom
