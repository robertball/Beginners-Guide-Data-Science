This is almost like my Mama Dollie's jelly cake.  We've only used apple jelly whipped together with a little melted butter for the icing.  Also, we poked a few holes in the cake with a fork to allow the jelly to ooze into the cake.  Talking 'bout good!

My Grandmother makes this cake...If you're not a fan of raspberry jelly use, you can substitute it w/ Apple or Apricot (which is used in grandmother's original recipe)

Also, since I don't have a lot of time,  I think I will  use a cake mix, preferably a butter-recipe type...it should turn out great. I'll let you all know after Thanksgiving.

cooking time is off, took 55 minutes in my oven and I have an oven thermometer to make sure it is the right temp.  Cake was good though.

Just pulled this cake out of the oven and it only took 40m in my oven at the temperature that was suggested. It looks and smells so good!! Can't wait for the best part---EATING IT :)Also, I substituted shortening an some salt for the butter, I was out of butter.

This is my favorite cake and I make it for holidays. I have learned to substitute organic and grassfed fats for the ingredients. In other words, use the healthiest ingredients to make this already fabulous, delicious cake. I also use jelly I have made myself. So good as leftover for the morning after Thanksgiving and Christmas!

This was a very easy recpie with a delicious flavor. I used homemade blueberry jelly and my family loved it.
