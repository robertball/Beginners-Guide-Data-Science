We used the slow cooker method mentioned by someone else (4 hrs in cooker, plus 1 hr with sauce) and it turned out excellent! Shredding the meat was messy but once I let it cool a bit it was much easier.

Absolutely fantastic!!! I cooked the meat a little different than suggested in the recipe but the sauce, I made it by the recipe.  I guess I don't know how to roast meat because mine just turned out dry and did not fall apart.  I made this recipe a second time for our fourth of July family reunion picnic and I cooked the meat with some beef broth and onions in my crock pot for four hours on high until the meat fell apart, then I added the sauce.  I let it sit in the refrigerator overnight (this sauce tastes best when you let it sit a few days).  The next morning I put it in a 350 degree oven for about an hour and all I can say is - WOW!!!!!

We made this in the crock pot - just dumped everything in, cooked on low 7 hours; shredded and put back in for another hour. Really good. It is quite tangy, not sweet at all.

The only suggestion I have is that you double the amount of sauce for the four pounds of meat.  I did and it was just right!  I had 8 people for dinner.  There was plenty left over and everyone raved about it!

Very tasty!  I made this in the crockpot, adding the sauce for the last 30 minutes, but otherwise did not change any of the ingredients.  This will be a great recipe to make ahead for parties.

This recipe was great. I also cooked the chuck roast in the crock pot for about 4 1/2 hours. We made it for four people (everyone loved it) and have still had leftovers for lunch for a week straight, and I'm not tired of it yet! I top mine with a slice of pepper-jack cheese.

Used 3 lbs of pot roast beef, cooked in slowcooker for approx five hours on high with cup of beef broth in the bottom.    Made sauce as directed, found it to be enough for 3 lbs of beef. However I added a bit extra beef broth to increase sauce amount.  Would definitly double the sauce recipe if I used more meat.  used beef broth instead of water to fill up the chili sauce jar...  very good! I give the sauce five stars but think a slow cooker is best for meat that is easy to shred. I think I will use this on my pulled pork as well, can't wait to see what the leftovers taste like tonight!

Throw away those jars of BBQ sauce.  This was wonderful bbq.  It was unique and very flavorful.  I had my doubts as I was preparing it.  This recipe fooled me and came out perfectly. I had to cook my roast about 30 minutes longer than the recipe called for.  This is definately a keeper recipe.

This is what barbecue is supposed to be!  Not too much tomato sauce, not too much vinegar.  Excellent!

I've made this several times now and the only improvement I'd recommend is: double the sauce!!  Even with a 2.5 to 3-pound roast, the final result was much drier than I was expecting when I went "by the book.".  But making twice as much sauce made it perfect.  This is extra good on toasted jalapeno-cheddar bread from the bread machine.  Thanks Vicki!

I used one roast that was about 2.5-3lbs and the sauce was just enough.  I cooked the roast in the crock pot all day with beef bouillon, onion and garlic powders which gave the meat some flavor.  Then I took it out and shredded it and then made the sauce.  I also used a ladle of the broth from the meat in the sauce.  And I did add some Jack Daniels original BBQ sauce as well to increase the barbecue flavor and it was so good.  My husband and I couldn't eat enough of it.  It was challenging to leave some for dinner the next night!  I will make this very often!

This makes the best BBQ beef sandwiches!  I pretty much follow the recipe as is.  I do cook the beef a little different.  I rub my roast with a little kosher salt, fresh ground pepper, onion powder and a little garlic powder.  I put it in a roasting pan and wrap it in heavy foil, cooking it at 300 degrees for approx. 3-3 1/2 hours.  Turns out perfect every time!  I do double the sauce and use about 6 lbs. of beef.  My husband and son cannot get enough!!!

This was such a nice change from using bottled BBQ sauce.  I tend to make my own dressings etc, so I just purchased Ketchup for the recipe rather than chili sauce.  Compare the ingredients, too similar for the price difference.  I agree with other reviews, you need to double sauce.  I cooked 8 lbs of eye of round roasts for several hours, less fatty meat and produced a lot of shredded meat for a large 4th of July celebration.  I only made 1 1/2 times the sauce for that much meat.  It seemed when i was cooking the sauce, it would be enough, however the shredded meat will asborb a lot of liquid.  It had a wonderful flavor but most definately, double the sauce called for according to the size of roast you are cooking.  Nice change from the usual thick sticky bottled sauces.  Everyone enjoyed.

This is good barbecue as is, but to make it better, I did what others had suggested and used some broth from cooking the roast (I did mine in a crockpot on high for about 4-1/2 hours to 5 hours.) instead of the water.  I also added some diced pickled jalepenos.  My husband said it needed more barbecue taste so I added about a fourth cup of Bulls Eye barbecue sauce.  After doctoring it up a bit it was 5 stars.

This was very good.  I used the sauce w/ shredded chicken instead of beef, would also be good with pork. Thanks

I don't normally like BBQ sauce, as it is too sweet for my taste.   This one is perfect! Everyone loved it.  It was easy to prepare. I suggest you use a good cut of roast, for tender, moist BBQ sandwiches!

This was really fabulous, everyone including picky eaters loved it!I cooked the roast in a crock pot from frozen on high for approx. 5 hours and then lowered to the low setting while I prepared the sauce. I was forced to change some ingredients since I live in the country and can't run to the store quickly, I used a combo of tomato ketchup and cocktail sauce to replace the chili sauce, but they interchange well and all in all I don't think this changed the recipe by very much. Since the cocktail sauce has horseradish in it I omitted the cayenne pepper. Also, I couldn't bear to have all that juice from the roast go to waste so instead of water I used the broth. Thank you for this delicious recipe.

My husband gave this recipe 5 stars, agreeing that it is better the day after it's made. I did think that doubling the recipe was a bit too much sauce for my 4 pounds of meat, maybe would use one and a half times the amount of sauce due to the meat juices that cooked out in the slow cooker. Am preparing my second batch this month to take to a party tomorrow.

I roasted it for 5 hours at 300 degrees, which made it more tender.  After the beef was cooked, I separated the pan drippings, poured off the fat, and combined the pan juices with the sauce.  Outstanding!  Leftovers went in a hurry.

I made this for our holiday party this year and everyone was raving about it!  I definitely agree with all the reviews suggesting doubling the sauce, I did and that seemed perfect.  I made the sauce and pulled the beef the night before and left the meat sit in the sauce overnight, to be reheated for the party.  We had a little for dinner the night we made it and it was yummy, but I do think that the taste was even better the next day after sitting overnight for the flavors to blend.  It stood up well to staying heated in a slow-cooker throughout the party.  A real winner and crowd-pleaser!

I could tell from the ingredients that this would be an excellent sandwich, so I quadrupled the recipe. The meat was so tender and the taste of the sauce permiated the shredded beef. Freezing small amounts in freezer bags will make for evening meals without the mess.

Love this recipe, so easy - but make it SPICY! I agree to double the recipe for the sauce - eliminate the butter (not necessary) - for double recipe use 12oz chili sauce and 12oz Crystal hot sauce. Serve over baked potato or rice. Also just dump all ingredients in a pot and simmer until meat shreds easily.

Great recipe.  I make the beef in the oven and then throw it in a crockpot with the sauce.  I rolled the finished product and some shredded cheddar cheese into refrigerated croissants for a shower, and they went fast!

I needed to use up some leftover roast and followed this recipe almost exactly, scaling for 1 lb of beef instead of 4. I did wish there were just a little more sauce, but doubling it as suggested might have made it too messy....but that's just me. The taste was fantastic, good balance of flavors that still let the meat itself taste delicious. I definitely recommend serving this on garlic-butter toast. Thank you!

This recipe is GREAT!  The only changes I made were using only 2lbs of the roast beef and I didn't use the cayenne pepper bc I didn't want it to be too spicy for my toddlers to eat.  I will cook this recipe again!

I doubled the recipe for the sauce as recommended and had just enough.  I made this for a huge family picnic and everyone raved about it.  I also used the meat juices in the chili sauce bottle in place of water to give it a bit more flavor.  This is a great recipe!

My meat turned out great, and I baked it exactly as stated. I like the body/firmness of the oven-cooked meat as opposed to the crockpot-cooked meat. I did shred and add to the double sauce recipe and THEN cook in the crockpot, and it was perfect. I did feel like it needed a LITTLE smoke taste, so a couple tbsp. of Trader Joe's BBQ sauce did the trick.

I started using your recipe years ago, but never rated it.  Made it for my husband's Poker Night this weekend, and it went FAST!  So I thought I'd take the time to let you know how much my family enjoys it!
I make the meat in the crock pot, and when it the times comes to make the sauce, I add the juices from the beef to the chili sauce bottle instead of the water.  Makes it SUPER rich, and super bad for you, I guess!  We love it! :)

Thank you!

Great recipe.  I had about 4 pounds of chuck roast, and there was no way that this made 16 servings- but it was still delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly, making the roast in the oven, but I added beef broth and chopped onion to the pan while roasting.  Two hours wasn't quite long enough to make this tender, so I added another 45 minutes to the cooking time.   I made the sauce exactly, but in the end, I used my immersion blender to make it smooth (bits of onion and garlic would not go over well with some of my family members).  I cooked and shredded the beef ahead of time, and then added it to my slow cooker.  I poured the sauce over all, and refrigerated overnight.  The next day, I reheated on low.  It was perfect.  It was also the perfect amount of sauce.  Doubling it would have been too much.

This was super yummy. I didn't have chili sauce in a bottle so I made chili sauce using a 15 oz can of tomato sauce, a tablespoon of sriracha, a tablespoon of roasted chili paste and a tablespoon of cholula. It had a really nice kick.

I tried this recipe without any changes. I did not care for it. Thankfully I tasted the bbq sauce before I added the shredded beef.  I ended up making my standard bbq with ketchup, brown sugar, etc.

I prepare two chuck roasts, about 3 lbs each to yield the 4 lbs of meat needed after removing fat. I also add a couple of ladles of the meat drippings which adds more flavor. To give it a little smoky flavor I squirt in a couple of tablespoonsful of Sweet Baby Ray's barbecue sauce, Hickory flavor. Served with a nice cold pasta salad and  you have a nice picnic supper.

I would give this ZERO stars if I could. Way too vinegary. Roast was not even close to tender in that amount of time. Recipe was impractical and used way more dishes than needed. Blaaahh. For once the crowd was wrong, this is not worthy of even the one star.

If I could rate this higher than five stars, I would! Could only find a 3# roast at grocery store, so used that with same amount of sauce. Glad I did, or I think it would have gotten a little dry. Other than increasing the amount of sauce wouldn't change a thing. Served on "homemade" hamburger buns from the bakery, with a noodle salad and chips. Was a great hit with everyone, taste and texture of the roast as opposed to using ground beef in barbecues is out of this world!

Excellent! I make this often and could probably live on it exclusively! The only changes I make to the recipe is cut the vinegar by half and increase the cayenne pepper a bit to give it a nice kick.

I love bbq beef/pork and am forever trying different recipes. This one was just okay. I ended up having to add bottled bbq sauce, because it didn't have enough sauce ... which defeats the whole purpose of making it from scratch to begin with.

This recipe is great!  I made it for my husbands football party and the guys loved it.  I'm not a huge fan of barbecue beef but this was different and awesome.  I was really looking forward to leftovers but unfortunately there weren't any.  This is a keeper!

Simply wonderful!  Another fantastic addition to my recipe box!  I made mine with
some beef cuts that had made their way to the back to my very large freezer and I 
was very happy with the results!  The next time I will have to try the chuck roast, 
but I can certainly say I was not unhappy with the results with the different pieces
of meat that I used to make it!  Most certainly a winner:)

This is SO good.  I found, though, that when I used a 2.5 lb roast it had just the right amount of sauce, so I think I would increase it if I was going to use a larger one.

This was fantastic.  I quadrupled the recipe to make enough for 50 at a church dinner.  Didn't look like enough at first but there was plenty. Got many compliments.  Tastes even better the next day.  Served it with baked beans and cole slaw and it was a big hit.  Thanks.

I followed the recipe as is because of the high rating and i wish I had read the comments first.  I don't agree with changing the recipe then giving it 4-5 stars.  Rate the recipe as is and recommend your changes in the comments.

The chuck roast is a fatty cut, and tearing it apart with two forks is not easy after 2 hours in the oven.  It was very chewy and full of fat which we had to tear out with our fingers or spit back onto the plate.  

The sauce was ok tasting but never thickened up even though I stirred it for more than a half hour.  The recipe gives no idea how long it should take to thicken, and since it didn't have the usual flour or cornstarch as thickener I didn't know how long it should take.

My boyfriend and I managed to eat a sandwich from this but we both said we wouldn't eat leftovers.

I made this during the summer and forgot to rate it but I came back to find the recipe we liked it so much.  I had the butcher slice the roast beef in the deli and then we made the sauce and let it marinate with the sliced beef overnight.  We cooked it up in a frying pan and it was excellent- everyone raved about the flavors- we did it southern style and had cole slaw to put on top.  MMM good!  I am back to use the same recipe for shredded pork sandwiches.

This was really simple to make and used ingredients I had on hand. I let it simmer in the sauce for a couple of hours on low. (I prefer a smoky sweet tomato-y sauce and thought this tasted of red pepper and chili sauce, but overall, it was really good and my family had seconds. My husband even said, please keep that recipe. Not my personal favorite, but a definite keeper.

Recipe is good, however It was to sweet for me & my husband. I added a little liquid smoke to try to counteract the sweetness, it didn't work.

I used everything except the cayenne pepper and it turned out WONDERFUL!!! I added a little bit of water to the bottom of the roasting pan & had to cook it longer then recommended (4 1/2 hrs) but I think it was because I didn't have a lid to my roasting pan and had to cover it with tin foil and I didn't have the edges completely sealed (after 3 1/2 hrs I realized this and after making sure edges were secured, it was done in about an hour.) Will definetely make this again, shredded meat would be good without the sauce to make tacos,enchiladas, etc.

This sauce is wonderful, very tangy! I added a little more salt to balance the brown sugar taste, but otherwise it was perfect. I scaled the recipe to serve four and the measurement for the chili sauce came out to be 1/4 pound, so I figured that must mean about four ounces; I didn't really know how much chili sauce or water to add, but it came out good anyway. Also, I sauteed the garlic with the onions first instead of adding it raw to the sauce. Very good sauce; I used the chuck roast for my boyfriend, but I think I could use it on a meat substitute for a sloppy Joe type sandwich for me! Thanks for sharing your family recipe!

Definitely a keeper!  The meat I used was closer to 3 lbs than 4 and the sauce was just the right amount.  I'd increase the sauce if I had a full 4 lbs.  

Yummy and easy.

I added sweet peppers and a little clove seasoning to it and made it with shredded pork left over from Christmas dinner.  Yummy!  It is a great basic recipe to have on hand.

Made it as the recipe states.  It's SO GOOD!  I made a double batch so my husband & I (plus company) could dig into it all weekend while working outside.  Every time we reheated it, I heard high accolades.  Saving this recipe for years to come!

This recipe is  very similar to a recipe from my mothers recipe box - it's old enough that it predates crockpots. But over the years I've made the transition and wanted to share some thoughts and suggestions.
If you're going to put a chuck roast in a crock, sear it well first. Seals in flavor and adds a little texture. You can place your roast on a bed of potato chunks and they'll end up nicely flavored and the juices will surround the meat on all sides. By all means, add your sauce at the beginning! We usually serve it as a roast for the first meal. For the second meal we shred it for sandwiches. Finally, whatever is left gets mixed (with any remaining sauce) with al dente egg noodles. Let the sauce cook in to finish cooking them.
I made 1 recipe of the sauce to see how the flavor was, knowing I would need to make more and could make "corrections" for our tastes there. I thought it was a little vinegary but you need that acid to tenderize the meat. I found the answer to be lemon juice. I reduced the vinegar overall by about a third and added that amount of lemon juice. For us, that was perfect! Thank you for sharing!

This is an awesome recipe!  I made it in the slow cooker. Layered 1/2 the onion, then the chuck roast, the other 1/2 of the onion and lastly poured the liquid over everything.  Cooked on Low for 7 hours, took the roast out and shredded with a fork, put the roast back in and cooked for one more hour.  Only change I would make is not to add the extra chili sauce bottle of water.  It's really not needed and made the barbeque a little wet.  My husband loved this beef and has requested I make it again.

I made this recipe, and my family loved it.  I did not have  a chuck roast, but instead used the sauce to cook a sirloin roast which was pre-sliced.  I did not shred it, but served the meat with veggies and rice pilaf.  I will use this recipe over and over because we all agreed that it was amazing.

This was delicious.  I especially liked that it called for putting the garlic in raw, which made the garlic flavor much more pronounced.  One thing I did differently was that instead of putting water into the chili sauce bottle to shake it up and get all the sauce out, I just put the  3 Tbsp of vinegar in and shook it up, not adding any water.  Didn't require much more cooking to make it nice and thick.

I followed the advice of one of the other reviews and put the roast and onions in a crock pot.  I used a can of beef broth and cooked on high for 4 hrs.  I followed the remainder of the recipe as instructed.  Two thumbs up.  Has  a sweet taste with a bite on the back end.  Delicious!

I had made a pork roast the day before with mashed potatoes and had lots of left overs.  The sauce was good and didn't change a thing.  If you like a kick to it, maybe add pepper flakes or hot sauce or your favorite ingredient.

Super easy. Changes; After browning use a slow cooker to cook and keep warm for parties. Go half and half with beef and pork shoulder. Use mini Kings Hawaiian Sweet Rolls. Top with favorite cole slaw.

I used the slow cooker method and easy!!  It's a nice change from adding Baby Ray's sauce in the shredded beef all the time.    I cooked the meat for 12 hours with the garlic and onion and then shredded the beef and put all the rest of the ingredients in and YUM! I've made this recipe several time now!

Yummy! I'm making this recipe for a bbq and so I had to test it out first. It was perfect not too tomatoy or bbq sauce tasting. The sause had a really great complexity to it that everyone will be impressed with. It's not the old bbq saucy sandwich. This is so much better. I will definitely double the sauce next go around!

This was very good, but I am not sure about the amout of sodium listed.  The chili sauce alone has that much per serving.  Is there such a thing as Low Sodium Chili sauce?

Liked the flavor of the sauce, but the meat came out very tough and did not shred like it should.  Would maybe make again but would do it in the crock pot next time.  I also would use a chuck roast.  They are too full of fat and you waste so much of it.

This was wonderful!! And so easy! The only thing I did different was to add 2 cups of beef broth to the roast while roasting, and the meat just fell apart! Also added 1 more TBSP of brown sugar, because I like a sweeter sauce. It is fantastic! Thanks for an awesome recipe!

This was very good. However, for the measuring and making of the sauce, I didn't think that it was worth the effort. I won't make this again, I will just go ahead and use Sweet Baby Ray's barbecue sauce and call it a day. Thanks.

I thought this was really good.  I followed the recipe exactly and the meat came out a bit dry.  I would do as other reviewers suggest and make the roast in a slow-cooker first.  Also, the sauce was quite tangy but I didn't mind. I added a little extra salt while cooking to cut down on the sweetness.  Will probably use less brown sugar next time.

Delicious sauce (I added at least twice as much cayenne though).  I made this in the crockpot - 4lb roast (with half an onion chopped up in 1c beef broth) for 4 hours on high, and the meat was very difficult to shred.  I finally ended up chopping it up, then adding it+sauce back to the pot for another hour.

The attraction to this recipe is the ease of preparation.  I was surprised at how good the simple sauce recipe turned out.  My kids were split on the meal.  My son ranked it second behind a recipe I tried over the winter.  My daughter, a bird-like eater anyway, wasn't too thrilled.

Oops!  I pan-browned the meat on both sides in the Dutch oven.  Then removed meat, cooked onions and garlic, and added remaining sauce ingredients.  Then I put meat back in pot, brought to a simmer and then put in the oven for 2.5 hours.  Took out, shredded meat and served.  Excellent and easy!  Thank you, Vicki!

I used 2 lbs of chuck roast which is good for the amount of sauce.  When I make it with larger quantities of meat, I will double the recipe accordingly.  I convection roasted my meat for 1 hr 45 min, then put it in a crockpot for 4 hours to ensure the meat would be tender.  I added the sauce for a couple more hours on low.  I am glad I read the reviews before attempting to make it.  My family loves this!  I've sent to my relatives!

I didn't like the sauce very much, way too tangy for my taste.  I also prefer my barbeques a little smokier and with thicker sauce.  I ended up adding a bottle of store-bought barbeque sauce to make it more to my liking.

This recipe was OK.  The sauce was a little too tamatoy for me and I found it rather bland.  I do think a little hot sauce and less chile sauce would do the trick.  I also used a crockpot for convience.

This was good, but a little different than what I was expecting.  I wouldn't really call it BBQ.  The sauce is good, very tangy, but you really do need to double it for the amount of meat.  I made it with a pork roast and it tasted like pork with a little sauce.  Good, but very mild and simple.  I'll make this again with more sauce.

The sauce for this was great.  I am always searching for ways to use chuck roast, because you can always get a good price on it.  I did not use as much meat as called for, and there was way to much sauce.  But it tasted sooo good, I will make it again, and cut down the recipe.  It makes too much for just my husband and I.

Delicious! I found that I really needed more sauce (weight of my roasts totalled slightly over 4lbs.)  BUT, everyone loved it.  This will stay in my recipe box permanently!

I used leftover roast beef and shredded it, then added it to the sauce.  It was delicious.  I didn't follow the exact measurements and when the sauce was too strong, I added a little beef broth and a touch of BBQ sauce.  Served it with roasted potatoes and vegetables - can't wait to try it in a sandwich!
