This is a great basic recipe to build off of. If you follow the directions above, it is very bland, but I was able to create something with a lot more flavor. I recommend doubling the butter, using only 3 cups of confectioners sugar (instead of the 4), doubling the cinnamon, doubling the vanilla, doubling the pumpkin puree, just foregoing the shortening all together, and adding a dash of nutmeg. It was a nice touch to my pumpkin cookies!

This is a basic pumpkin frosting. It was good, but I did add to it. I doubled the butter and the pumpkin puree, left out the shortening. I added 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp of all spice, and reduced the vanilla a little. Thank you for the recipe.

It turned out good, however I read the reviews first and took some advice. I used the same amount of confectioners sugar that was recommended in the recipe, but I did double the butter and pumpkin, and I added cinnamon, nutmeg and all spice to taste. I did not cut out the shortening, nor did I cut out the vanilla. It turned out great and I used it as a topping on pumpkin bread. Thank you for the recipe!

This made a lot of frosting!  I frosted chocolate cupcakes and they were a hit.  Last night I made pumpkin cornbread recipe from here as muffins and used frosting on those instead of honey like I do with regular cornbread muffins. Also very good.
