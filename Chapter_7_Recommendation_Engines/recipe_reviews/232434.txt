This pie is absolutely awesome! I did use different apples. I found an apple tree in my backyard; they were similar to gala apples, I suppose, but they were still tart because they weren't fully ripe. They worked just fine. 

The apples soak up all the delicious berry goodness. I did use quite a few more blackberries in the sauce than the recipe called for, and I am glad I did. 

Delicious. Made two- both were gone within 3 days. Definitely baking again soon.

Very tasty pie! Made it for thanksgiving and it was a huge hit! The only thing I did differently is I did NOT pour the sauce over the top crust, I poured it over the apples then placed the crust on top. The only thing I would do differently next time is to use less of the sauce mixture because the juice from the apples and black berries make it watery inside the pie. I would also coat the apples and black berries a sugar/flour mixture to help thicken the sauce while it’s cooking. I think I’d like it a lot more if the juice stayed put in the pie instead of free flowing out of the pie when you slice it. But either way it’s a really tasty pie, even my 5 year old grand daughter tore it up and loved it!

Excellent! Made it according to recipe except for that 6 blackberries halved thing. I put half of the blackberries in the pie with the apples and half in the sauce because that what is the only thing that made sense to me. Author needs to correct that portion of the recipe. Otherwise, especially warm with a scoop of cold vanilla ice cream on top, it's almost worth the chiggers I got picking the blackberries. Very good pie.
