This was great! My man said it was the best meal I ever made in seven years! Haha! I also added chicken, so made it with chicken and shrimp...

Awesome quick and easy dinner! I added a little onion salt and some broccoli (we wanted a little extra veg), and my boyfriend and I both really enjoyed it (he ate two heaping plates). Would definitely recommend, and itâ€™s an easy recipe to switch out proteins or add ingredients to. Will for sure make again!

Great meal. This was the first pasta I made. I usually never cook but this app is interesting. My boyfriend loved it, so definitely I would do it again!

This turned out really good. The only change I made was with the grape tomatoes. My husband and I thought they would stay more whole with the short cooking time. So, I added them to the wet ingredients to steam them and soften them up. Then, I smashed them a little. We only ate half of the shrimp, so I made the dish with the leftovers  2 nights later. This time, I cut up a chicken breast and some green pepper and sauteed that in more of the dressing until done. I added the leftover pasta and then topped with the leftover shrimp. YUM!  My husband thought he would like it kicked up a notch, so next time, I will add some red pepper flakes. THIS IS DEFINITELY A KEEPER!

This was an easy and delicious way to make a cream sauce! I substituted sausage for shrimp and it was YUM.  I roasted my tomatoes on the oven the previous day with garlic and olive oil.
