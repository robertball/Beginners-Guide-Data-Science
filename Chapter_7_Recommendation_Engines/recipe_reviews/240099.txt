Love the recipe, as I am always looking for healthier ways to feed my family.  This is almost like a dessert bread, I used grape jelly as I am allergic to strawberry.  But will experiment with different jellies to see if the flavor changes.  I used a regular oven instead of a bread maker, bread came out fine.  Cooked it for about 1hr and 15 mins on 350.

I actually really liked it.  The first time I made it, I used honey instead of jelly and it didn't bake all the way through (and I used an Oster bread machine as was in the directions).  Even after baking it an additional fifteen minutes in a conventional oven, a significant portion in the middle never set.  The next time I made it, I stuck to the recipe and used jelly, and it came out perfectly!

It was okay.  The peanut butter flavor was mild, but left that dry PB taste in my mouth.  I think I expected to actually taste jelly, but I guess it was to just serve as a sweetener.  Texture was nice though.
