What a great idea! These are more like potato pancakes than hash browns, though. I do have to say that after tasting a test patty, I found these kind of bland and too moist to hold together. I added more flour and cheese , a beaten egg, lots of chives, some minced onion and red bell pepper and a little garlic. They turned out quite nice looking and very tasty with a unique texture and a subtle sweetness. Since squash sizes vary so greatly, I would have preferred a cup measurement rather than just calling for one squash.

Tasty combination of flavors and all, just not a life-changing experience. We've made similar "potato pancakes" using zucchini, and these were definitely better than the zucchini. 

Also, I'd beg to differ on the "1-inch thick" instruction. We got a nice, mildly crisp and tasty hash brown by keeping them smaller (3 in. diameter or so) and thinner (maybe 1/2 in. thick).

I followed the advice of the Sept 18, 2012 reviewer "hazelnut" of adding more flour and cheese, a beaten egg, chopped red bell pepper, chopped onion and minced garlic. I made a double batch which made 25 hash browns/pancakes. My husband was my taste-tester. He had to eat two before he could give his official approval ;) We tried it with sour cream and salsa. We liked it best with just the sour cream.

My daughter and I loved these. I agree with others these are not a hashbrown but more of a potato pancake. I used squash that I had already cooked. I made sure to drain any excess water. Mixed and measured patties with my 1/4 cup as written. My patties were  thinner than an inch thick.They fried up quickly and were best while still hot. We ate them plain seasoned with only salt and pepper  simply because I did not realize I was out of sour cream. These are a great base recipe... they are good plain but would be great with other flavor additions.

Personally for me, this is 4 stars as written. The other reviewers were correct, it needs an egg and a ton of seasonings. I gave it 5 because it's SUCH a cool idea! There are endless ingredients you could add to this recipe. Great job! :o)

This is fine like it is, but if you want more flavor (and who doesn't, right?)  I suggest you add in LOTS of seasonings.  It can be pretty much anything you like, just make sure there is some onion, garlic, and white pepper.  This is a good recipe, but if you want it to be GREAT...add in some seasoning!

Was a 4 until I topped each one with a teaspoon of saugage-flavored soy crumbles & a teaspoon of shredded non-fat mozzerella. This adds 40 calories to each patty, but they get a 5 in my house now!

Fantastic!  I agree with the other reviewers, you need to add some peppers, onions, garlic, etc.
With those additions, its 5 stars, as is 4 stars.  My hubby ate all of them, and asked if I could make him a second batch.  Thanks for submitting!

I added cilantro, jalapeños and red onions to mine, Chilula hot sauce and some seasoning. They needed extra flavor but we like a little kick.   I saved some time and microwaved the squash. I'll make these again for sure. A healthy and delicious alternative to regular hash browns.

I never cook spaghetti squash all that time in the oven. It tastes exactly the same if you cut it in half &  put upside down on a plate in the microwave. Pierce it a couple times with a knife. Cooking Time would be determined by size of squash. Recipe is great idea but season it up for sure!

I read e reviews and added chopped onion, egg, and garlic powder to this recipe. The flavor was very good but the texture was very mushy. I was happy to eat this once but I  will not make it again. My husband was less pleased.

Brilliant idea!! Especially if you are stuck on a diet:)  Because of the diet, I omitted the cheese.  I added finely chopped Jalapeño and served it with salsa.  So good!

I just wanted to say that I have not tried this specific recipe, but I have made something similar and they are delicious. I add Mexican type spices to mine. I add cumin, coriander, chili powder, cayenne, onion powder or diced onion, as well as a bit of garlic and salt. I imagine they would be very good with some Asian seasoning too.

I used leftover "spaghetti squash primavera my way" which  added a bit more seasoning ( I will be putting the combination in a new recipe).  But I love this idea and basics, thanks for posting.

This looked like a good use of our extra summer squash so I tried it. I followed the advice of other reviewers and added a few things. I doubled the flour, added an egg, a spoonful of minced garlic, and 1/2 a chopped onion.  The end result was not bad, but I probably won't make it again. Turned out bland and a little greasy for my taste. My husband liked it better and even reheated and ate the leftovers.

I thought this was really good. We bought spaghetti squash for the first time and we had no idea what to do with it. I came across this recipe and it made the spaghetti squash taste amazing. We added montreal steak spice to ours to give it some extra flavor
