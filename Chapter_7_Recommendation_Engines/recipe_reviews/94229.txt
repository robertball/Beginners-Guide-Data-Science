Yum, love this. You can customize this to suit your tastes. We make this a lot at work as it is easy to heat up the hot dogs in one slow cooker and the chili in another. We usually use shredded Cheddar cheese and have mustard closeby. Thank you.

Next time I would add more chips 'cause I couldn't tell that they were in the chili. A good hot dog recipe.

I really wanted to like these, but ended up scraping the stuff off and eating the hot dog plain.
