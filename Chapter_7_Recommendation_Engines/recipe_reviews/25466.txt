I used a homemade cajun seasoning in this recipe and went light on the salt. I did use one large sweet onion instead of a white onion but I kept everything else the same. I seriously gorged myself on this recipe. This is a wonderful idea--seems like I make something like this every month or so and think to myself how great this is......then I forget about it for another month. This would be easy enough to vary up the vegetables to what you have on hand.

Very good!  We made this in the winter and instead of putting it on the grill, we used the oven broiler.  It had to be in the oven a little longer (5-7 minutes on each side), but it was worth it.  Thanks

This is an incredible recipe!!  Easy to fix and really complimented some cajun chicken grilled at the same time.  I "sauteed" on a broiler pan directly on the grill and included green onions and mushrooms.  Definitely a hit with the guests!!  Thanks for sharing!!

This is very good for those who like spice.  I grill them well, since I hate squash & zucchini "steamed."  A nice way to add zip to the usual veggies.

Loved the preparation and cooking method, and the Cajun spice was an interesting change from the way I typically season vegetables.  I used baby zucchini and yellow pattypan squash and eliminated the cayenne as is our preference.

Very tasty. I added some eggplant to the mix, used a lot more veggies than the recipe called for and less olive oil. Nice taste. I'll make this again

Very, very good!!  Neither of us like squash all that much, but this recipe's made converts of us!  We'll use this easy, extremely tasty recipe often this summer.  Served with grilled cajun chicken breasts for quick, healthy meal.

No doubt, the ingredients in this recipe can easily be substituted with other veggies, and that's what I did; I used what I had on hand. Sweet onions, red peppers, and fresh mushrooms. I look forward to trying this with zucchinis and yellow squash down the road. The olive oil mixture is a spectacular idea. I used a grilling wok to grill the veggies on the backyard grill, despite temp in the 30s. I had some marinated veggies delivered to my room in Vegas and have been looking for a recipe reminiscent of that. Thanks Kelly, and allrecipes.

Couldn't find, specifically, cajun seasoning so used a blackened seasoning. ALso used a grill basket instead of skewers. Don't think I'll make agian. Something just wasn't right about the mix of flavors.

I went ahead and did these in a grill pan cause I had run out of skewers and didn't want them to fall through.  Yum!  Nice and spicy!

I didn't have any cayenne pepper and still turned out great!  I sauted them instead of grilling ( too cold outside) but will try the grilling when it gets warmer.

I loved this!  I followed the recipe except I added mushrooms, too.  Next time I might reduce the olive oil and add chicken to the skewers.  My first dinner cooked for the in-laws, they were impressed!  Thank you!!

The group of people I made this for all really enjoyed this-- instead of two yellow squashes, I only did one and did 1 and a half green peppers cut into large chunks instead. I omitted the additional salt-- the w. sauce has enough! I used one large vidalia onion and put everything on skewers. I would definitely make this again, but with a touch less olive oil.

I did not care for these. This may be good if you don't care for squash or zucchini because this hides the flavor. Also you may want to check your cajun seasoning for salt. Mine was a bit salty with adding extra salt. I will stick with my recipe of just butter and garlic.But thanks for the recipe anyway.

We really enjoyed the flavor of the marinade.  My yellow squash had gone bad, so I ended up just using zucchini and onion, though I might try this again with eggplant, too.  I marinated my veggies for several hours and did cook them longer than the 5 minutes.

I only made a quarter of this recipe since I only had one zucchini, but the flavor was great. I actually sautéed the dish and added 3 eggs for a breakfast dish.

Very good.  Funny thing is, my hubby ate some while they were marinating and thought they were good like that.  (Actually, he only liked the yellow squash, not the zucchini).  I left them marinating over night and they could have had more.  I grilled them on a stove top grill my folks bought us since we don't own a grill and they were delicious.  Thanks for sharing.

I thought I had cajun seasoning but I didn't, so I used some seasoning blend.  I made a double batch so I doubled the cayenne pepper, but I wish I hadn't.  Only I liked this ... my husband and daughter thought it was TOO spicy (the pepper adhered to some of the squash more than others resulting in some super-spicy bites).  I won't make again.

I cut the salt & cayenne pepper in half & wish I had out out the cayenne pepper completely. This was too spicy for us. Very good but too spicy. I don't own a grill so I sauteed the veggies. Served with Cajun Style Burgers from this site. Thanks.

Very impressed with the ease and the flavor was wonderful! I added peppers and mushrooms and cooked them in a foil packet on the grill, 15 minutes per side. The mushrooms were the best of them all, but the peppers got a little to over cooked for me. will definitely cook again and again!

Delicious.  I cooked them in a skillet full of holes on the grill.  Didn't marinate and they were still delicious.  Even the picky ones in the family enjoyed!

It was simple and delicious!  One note of caution if you are serving this to kids hold the cayenne pepper or halve it, my kids did not appreciate how HOT it was:)  I also let my chicken sit in the sauce for about 20 mins!  YUMMY!

I used this with zucchini and red/green bell peppers and everything tasted fantastic. That bit of Worcestershire sauce really set off the spiciness. I did omit the salt as the cajun seasoning I used (Tony Chachere's, the best IMO) already has it. Except for the salt I followed as written and really don't think this could be any better. I look forward to using this in a foil pack with veggies and chicken for an upcoming camping trip - thanks very much for sharing :)

At last a way to get my husband and I to eat our veggies!  I made a second batch of the marinage and threw chicken tenders in it for a few minutes, then onto the grill.  What a wonderful dinner.  Just served with MacNCheese to cool off the tastebuds a little!

This is my favorite recipe for grilled veggies...so easy to make with great flavor. My husband loves the spicy kick. I have used all kinds of veggies for this. Mushrooms, onions, zucchini, squash, red peppers, green peppers, tomatoes. Anything you have on hand will work.

We just bought a new grill. We had steaks and these veggies as our first meal. Even my husband who normally doesn't care for zucchini liked it. I know we will have this again and again over the summer.

Really good side dish!  And a good way to use the garden's bounty!  I don't have a grill basket and didn't want to mess with skewers so just cooked it in a very hot skillet.  A little too much cayenne for us but otherwise very good.  Loved the onion wedges with the squash!  Will definitely make again with a little less cayenne!

Two changes: I sauteed it rather than grilling, and I used Old Bay rather than cajun seasoning (fairly similar ingredients). Great taste (especially the Worcestershire!), and though I could see someone not liking the cayenne if they don't like spicy, I thought it was a nice amount of heat. I'd use this marinade for vegetables again.

Very simple, but very good.  After marinating a full day (plans changed), I put the veggies in a foil pack and put it on the grill on the rack above high heat.  Maybe a half hour.  Delicious!

I have never had such delicious zucchini in my life! That may be because I never grilled it out on an outdoor grill before — only in the oven — but this marinade definitely helped a lot. I didn't have Worcestershire sauce so I used soy sauce. I cut the zucchini (that's all I used, no squash or onions) into spears, marinated it for around half an hour, and then grilled. Even though this came out after we were stuffed, we all enjoyed it.

Wonderful! My 4 year old ate a lot. I added a few dashes of white pepper to the marinade (which I doubled). Also I put a pound of halved brussel sprouts on the kebobs. I cut the zucchini and squash slices to about 1/2 of an inch and grilled them about 10 minutes flipping them a few times. I am excited to make this at a cookout this summer! The brussel sprouts might have been my favorite so I look forward to trying other veggies.

Loved how quick and easy this was. Omitted salt, used mushrooms, onions, yellow pepper, and zucchini because it was what I had on hand. Used grill basket instead of skewers. Husband approved and thought the mushrooms  were amazing!  I think next time we grill steaks, I will do mushrooms and onions in this seasoning for on top.

So yummy! My Cajun seasoning is salty so I didn't add more salt. I did add a little garlic, just because we add it to everything. Marinated about an hour. Grilled onion, zucchini, tomato, eggplant, and carrot.

i was somehow redirected to this recipe when trying to replicate another one i had rated before.. glad i stumbled across this bc it's really good.. made the following changes: 2 T of olive oil, 3/4 T of worcestershire, no salt, and added 2 T of lemon juice.. me and bf loved this.. used on onions, tomatoes, and bell peppers we were grilling.. ty for the recipe! UPDATE: i followed this to a T now having all the ingredients.. it could have used a little more salt but was still pretty tasty and i prefer having the lemon for a little acid

this was just OK for us. i didn't use the grill, but baked it in the oven instead.  It just didn't taste very good.  maybe grilling makes all the difference.

We grilled these in a packet next to chicken and it was great!! It definitely needs about half the olive oil in the packet so this makes it a tad healthier :o) I also added garlic powder and onion powder and omitted the cayenne since my cajun seasoning had plenty already. I will make this again for sure! thanks

Used this recipe to make beef kabobs for a Mardi Gras party.  Instead of grilling, though, I baked the beef kabobs.  They were excellent.

Very tasty.  I find that I generally prefer a simple sprinkling of salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning, but this recipe is terrific when I'm in the mood for something a little different.

Very good.....I used olive oil Pam instead of the evoo....sprayed the veggies(baby bellas, vidalia onion, and red peppers), and added the seasonings. Grilled and stuffed into a whole wheat pita. Very tasty, will use the zucchini and yellow squash next time. Thanks for change in grilled veggies!

My husband and I both liked these. I am always looking for new marinates or seasonings to use for veggies on the grill. I only had 1/2 of a large white onion but other than that followed the recipe. I threw it in my grill wok along side the simple country ribs from this site, also made the mexican bean salad to go along with it. Looking forward to leftovers tonight.

This was delicious!  Probably don't need as much olive oil as it calls for, though.

We used only zucchini as it's all we had, but the coating/marinade was delicious. We grilled in an aluminum foil packet alongside chicken. A great meal!
