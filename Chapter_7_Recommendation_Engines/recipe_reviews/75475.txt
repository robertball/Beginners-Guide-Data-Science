I was looking for a roast pork recipe and came across this.  I cubed the roast and seasoned with salt and pepper...then I sauted till cooked though.  I substituted the cream of celery with cream of broccoli and cream of mushroom simply because that was what I had on had.  I omitted the curry because I am not a fan.  I also used crushed up ritz crackers to top the dish before baking.  I love this and wil make it again.

I've been looking for a good leftover pork recipe and this fit the bill to a T.  It's very similar to a Chicken Divan recipe (minus the rice) I like to make.

I didn't have cream of celery soup, so I instead used 1 can of cream of mushroom and 1 can of broccoli cheese.  During the last 8 minutes I added shredded cheese and topped with croutons before putting it under the broiler.  It was fabulous.  I would also think that a box of dried stuffing mix (Stove top or similar) would also be a great addition.

Thanks - This will be a day after staple whenever we have pork roast or leftover tenderloins.

Thanks for the recipe Julie, it was great!  I had some left-over pork chops that I didn't want to get dried out by cooking them a second time.  This casserole not only kept the pork moist, but the curry and black pepper gave it an excellent flavor.  I used fresh broccoli instead of the frozen kind.  This was an easy recipe.

This is a definite keeper, I had to change the soup to Cream o'Mushroom and Cream o'Broccoli and Cheese (what I had).  I did and (and solved the presentation problem 3/4 cup of french fried onions (of green been casserole fame) then 5 min before serving topped with the rest of the can and baked 5 min more ... viola ... presentation simple, Thanks!

Fantastic!!!  I made this with frozen spinach and frozen corn instead of broccoli, and added a bit more curry spice, including a dash of cumin, tumeric, and cloves for a more authentic Indian curry flavour.  I also reduced the mayo to about 1/4 cup and used cream of mushroom because that's all I had.  I will definately make this again!

This was great. I have made this several times and like adding fresh broccoli better. No need to cook the broccoli first. Also try using some pork sirloin. Its a cheaper cut of meat, just cut up and fry with some seasoning in a touch of olive oil.

Really yummy and reheats well. I made a few simple changes.  Substituted salt for the curry, used a can of cream of chicken and a can of cream of mushroom soup. I also used a 14 oz bag of broccoli flowerettes and a couple handfuls of shredded mexican cheese stirred in.  The next day I added a little milk to the leftovers before I microwaved them. It seemed even better the second day!

This was a great way to use up left-over pork roast. I used cream of broccoli and cream of mushrooms soups instead, and I also skipped the curry (simply because I didn't have any in the house). I would make this again, although not for company, since, like most casserols, it doesn't look too appealing.

I use this recipe as a base and just throw in whatever I have on hand-- peas, corn, broccoli, ham, bacon, cheese... you can really use your imagination, and it's super forgiving on the cook times.. The only change I make consistently is that I mix two beaten eggs in with the liquidy ingredients before baking. Thanks Julie!

This was excellent!  The only change I would make is to add some salt (the broccoli since it isn't cooked isn't salted), and I took the advice of another reviewer and put on top a coating of Stove-Top Chicken stuffing and then sprinkled shredded Parmesan on top. Dried bread crumbs would do, or any dried stuffing nix.  I put it in an oval Corning casserole with a glass lid and took the lid off for the last 15 minutes or so.  No more wasted leftover pork roast for us!!

I had leftover asain style pork roast & leftover "curried rice pilaf" from this site, along w/leftover steamed broccoli. An ingredient search turned up this recipe. WOW! It is FANTASTIC! I'll be ensuring leftovers of these foods often, no doubt! I can't speak highly enough of this casserole!

I fancied this up a little, using what I had in the cabinet; it was very convenient and easy.  I used Lundberg's rice, a mix of black japonica, mahogony & brown long grain rice. Left it slightly underdone. (Real rice takes about an hour to cook). Mixed it with lightly steamed fresh broccoli. Used one can of organic, lowfat cream of mushroom soup and one organic, lowfat cream of celery. No mayo. For spices I used 1 teaspoon of cumin, 1 teaspoon of garlic powder and a little red pepper. Put it in a highsided corningware dish so it would be deep, not all spread out and dried up, and covered with French-fried onions. Baked at 350 for 30 minutes with the lid, removed lid for 15 minutes to crunch onions up. This is hearty fare for family folks, but certainly not for guests. It does have the salty, industrial taste that canned soup provides and it is hard to hide that flavor no matter what spices you use. While I normally wouldn't cook this way (using canned soup) I had tons of leftover smoked pork chops and a husband who isn't picky about ingredients and he loved it for his week at work as leftovers, it is easy to warm up and filling. Some people will find this is very, uhm, gaseous. If you have issues with pork or broccoli, simply have a Beano or two...no problems! Thank you for the easy recipe that was a husband pleaser and easy for me to make!

I halved the recipe and my husband and I shared a wonderful casserole that fed us well for two nights. I left the seasoning as it was in the full recipe and enjoyed every bite. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This was very simple and turned out good. Well it had - no smell - no taste. 
maybe it would be good with shredded cheese mixed in and more seasoning.

Great with left over chicken substituted for the pork.  I used cream of mushroom instead of the cream of celery because that's what I have stocked.  With the chicken substitution, this is one of the most requested meals in our house

great use of a dry smoked pork roast. My only substitution was the veg. I used a corn, pepper black bean mix as that's what I had on hand. I also put some smoked cheddar cheese in it, didn't like the cheese on its own but work well in this dish. I love curry, you may want to add salt to your taste.

This was very good and easy to put together. It fit nicely in a 9x13. You could very easily adapt other veggies to go into this casserole, also Chicken would be a perfect sub for the pork! Thanks for the recipe.

Wow - loved it, we all did! I was so surprised because SS claims he doesn't like rice but this was great. I even made it with extra rice (3c water - 1-1/2c brown basmati) because the pork I used was about 2lb but I kept the qty the same on everything else. I didn't know if the curry would be too different from what I usually make (seldom use it) but the amount was just right and I just love this recipe way more than I expected :)

A keeper!!!  Kids loved it!! It's easy which is ALWAYS a plus.  I used Mushroom, Chicken soup and roast pork.  I followed everything else to a tee but the last 15 minutes of baking I added bread crumbs mixed with Parmesan cheese on top and continued to bake uncovered.

We're not big on one-dish casserole type meals, but we had a lot of meat leftover on our rotisserie chicken that we decided to use in this recipe.  The curry is light and not overpowering.  I thought the mayo added a lot of flavor. I used fresh brocoli and it actually got sort of soggy.  (I'm used to just lightly steamed brocoli.)  Anyway, I can't imagine making this with frozen brocoli.  Then it would be super soggy.  Overall we enjoyed it a lot and will make it again!

Thanks for a good recipe. I had some left over roasted pork tenderloin and brown rice an needed an idea of what to do with it. I substituted cream of mushoom and cream of chicken only because I didn't have the celery soup. I also didn't have any broccoli left(darn) so I threw in some french-style green beans and topped it all with OJ's Fried Onion Rings. Shades of the ole T'Day green bean casserole re-visited. Double-double leftovers? I may try this with leftover turkey too.

Great one dish meal. I used cream of chicken soup, its what I had in my kitchen.  Also used un cooked "stew" chunked pork. Added 1/2 tsp garlic. didn't have the spice it called for.  3 out of 4 in my family liked it.  Oh and used frozen brocoli florets. ...will make it again.

Great and super easy. i substituted the cream of celery soups for one can of cream of broccoli and one can of cheddar cheese soup. With 15 minutes left of cooking time, I added crispy fried onions to the top of the casserole.

It was easy enough that I could do it, and that's saying something. Instead of using cream of celery though, I used cream of chicken and cream of mushroom because that's what I had on hand. I changed out curry powder for salt, but next time I think I'll just leave out the salt, because the ham I used was salty enough as it was.

This was a great recipe, and I agree with the other reviews that say it gets better the second day.

I made a few changes:
quinoa instead of rice
2 cans mushroom soup {with garlic}
omitted the mayo
added cumin, turmeric and ginger
loaded up on the broccoli
and as a last minute idea tossed in a few slices of fresh portabella mushrooms

Really great for cooking something super fast that is (semi) healthy and filling. I left out the Mayo b/c I figured the 2 cans of condensed cream of celery would be enough. And I used cumin instead of curry powder b/c I didn't have any.  Some suggestions for making this healthier: - use fresh veggies - opt for chicken breast over pork - use reduced fat cream of celery - opt for long grain brown rice over white - alter the ratio of grain-meat-vegetables  This is a very versatile recipe and good for those times you don't feel like cooking a big meal but don't want to spend money outside.

This has now become one of my favorite dishes!  I was wanting to do something interesting with my leftover pork roast, and luckily had just enough broccoli, rice, and mayo to make this dish.  I love how creamy it is.  The curry is an excellent touch!

My family loved this recipe, although I did make a few changes.  I omitted the curry powder and used 2 tsp. sage, 1 tsp. thyme, and 1 tsp. Old Bay Seasoning. I believe the broccoli made it a bit soupy and will try using peas and/or carrots the next time instead.  I will also use paprika sprinkled on the top to make it more visually appealing, and uncover it for the last 10 minutes of baking to brown even more.

My husband raved for several minutes - he rarely does this! I have leftover pork often, so I'm sure this recipe will become a staple. Cleanup was easy too, as even a double batch was eaten up by my large family (5 kids and two parents at home for this meal).

tasted ok, but boring.  We like all the ingredients but not very flavorful.  I tasted before putting in the oven and added:  dried minced onion, about 1 Tbl. and the same amount of dried mushrooms.  I will try again BUT will add 1/2 pkg onion soup mix and possibly Kitchen Bouquet for color & flavor

Really liked this casserole, I  1 can cream of chicken, and 1 can cream of mushroom soup, and shredded cheddar cheese. I also shredder the pork (much better then cubed). I would like to add mushrooms and maybe use chicken. Very good recipe with a few edits!

I veganized this with Loving Hut's faux ham and made my own (cashew) cream of celery soup at home. Added "buttered" (Earth Balanced) bread crumbs and it was super delicious!

I had one leftover smoked pork chop so I halved the recipe. It was great with brown rice and fresh broccoli. I love the curry used as more of a background seasoning rather than strong and upfront. 
Very cool.

This was a fantastic "base" recipe.  And I say that because I love to tinker with recipes to suit my own tastes.  I found the sauce a little rich so I thinned it with some low-sodium chicken broth. I also wanted to up the vitamin factor so I threw in some diced red pepper and carrots for colour,and some sauteed chopped onion and celery, along with fresh broccoli.  I also used a mix of cream of celery soup and cream of broccoli.  I have topped it with buttered bread crumbs and shredded cheddar and the family LOVES this.  Thanks for submitting!

This recipe has potential but as is it is rather bland - even using the tips from another rater to add cheese and stuffing mix on top. I will make it again, but with the addition of more curry, and some cayenne pepper.

YUM! Used fresh instead of frozen broccoli, and used about 1.5 times more than the recipe called for. Also added a red pepper, some garlic, onion, and paprika. Did not use mayo as I did not have any, but didn't miss it. Delicious comfort food.

I used this as the basis of a recipe using 2 cans of tuna instead of pork. I also modified it because I don't have any of the soups on hand. So I used 1/4 cup lowfat mayo, 1/4 cup 2% milk, 1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt and 1/4 cup of leftover yogurt cilantro and chive dip for the liquid.  I also seasoned with 1 tsp (est) of Konriko Greek seasoning, as well as the curry and pepper. And I used fresh broccoli instead of frozen, leeks instead of onions, and green Greek olives. I added about 1/2 cup of grated Asiago cheese for the last 6 minutes.  Delicious! Thanks for the idea.

This was pretty good... I had to leave out the curry (daughter hates it), but, added some shredded cheddar cheese and FF onion rings over the top for the last 10 minutes, and I think that is what MADE the dish.  Would love to try with the curry sometime!

This recipe was great!  I'm lactose intolerant, so I used coconut milk instead of a cream soup.  Fresh broccoli gave a great crunch.  I added lots of curry and fresh ground black pepper.  This was perfect for leftover pork loin, and was easy to make on a busy day!  Definite repeat!

Pretty good - but not worth the five stars IMO. I left the curry out, because my wife doensn't care for it, and I found it lacking a bit of flavor. The french fried onions over the top are a MUST - this recipe would be pretty bland without them. You can use a cheaper cut of pork and it still comes out tender, making this a good recipe for a budget.

I forgot the black pepper and curry(oops), I added shredded mild cheddar and stuffing on top and used fresh broccoli.As some of the other reviews suggested. I never noticed the missing ingredients.
Thanks!

I made this last week but substituted cream of mushroom for the soup and bulgur for the rice. It was easy and tasty.

Fantastic!  This was a hit at our house, even with the kids!  No cream of celery hanging around the house, so I had to substitute with cream of mushroom.  MM  MM  MMMM!!!
