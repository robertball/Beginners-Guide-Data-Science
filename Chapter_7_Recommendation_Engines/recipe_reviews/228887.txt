What a great pizza! The dough was easy to work with and super easy to make which makes a delicious pizza.  Me and the little guy had a blast decorating the pizzas.  What a great way to have kids use their imagination!

These were yummy and soooo cute! I mixed the dough and baked it earlier in the day, and when my little guy got home from school, he helped me top them to look like spooky spiders. We had a blast doing this together, and the finished product was not only adorable, but also delicious! This is such a fun idea, and one that we will be doing again, wether it's Halloween or not! Thanks for sharing. :)

We made these at a get-together we hosted for the neighborhood kids and they LOVED them!  Some of them used unconventional toppings, but everything was eaten.  Thanks for the adorable idea--they were delicious also!

I didn't hate this dough, but I much prefer the whole wheat agave version that I usually make. This was very easy though and fun to make the little pizzas.

These turned out to be really fun, easy and tasty pizzas. I got 7 pizzas out of the recipe. Everyone thought the crust was tasty and they were just the right size for a group of 9 yr. old girls. They already want to make them again! I haven't had much luck with pizza crusts in the past but those days are over with this recipe.

The crust was easy to make. I made this for a halloween party so I set out all different toppings and let everyone make their own pizzas. Fun! I made a garlic pizza sauce and set out the toppings... Mozzerella cheese, Parmesan cheese, Pineapple and canadian bacon, italian sausage, mushrooms, Red peppers, Pepperoni and my favorite Pesto and shrimp. You can put any topping on you like.

fabulous crust, and very cute topping ideas.  I love how you prebake these and can freeze for later.  I froze them and then we used these on the grill.  Perfect!

SO easy and the flavor is great! I loved making 8 personal pizza doughs but freezing half for later. I will definitely use this recipe again and again.

So I know this is probably supposed to be a children's activity, but I had a lot of fun with the faces!  Makes a very pretty construction "bar" to set out all of the veggies, plus they're tasty.  I'm looking forward to making these with my niece and nephew the next time they come to visit!

We had a great time decorating our pizzas for dinner last night!  I followed the measurements in this recipe for the crust, but I think we prefer the measurements on the back of the Fleischmann's Pizza Crust Yeast package a little better.  I made a batch of Exquisite Pizza Sauce (minus the Parmesan cheese) from here at AllRecipes for the sauce and we used mozzarella cheese pepperoni, red bell peppers, and black olives to decorate them.  I only divided the dough into 4 piece so we could be a little more elaborate with our decorations.

My son and grandson had fun making these with me. They really tasted good too. I used a garlic cream sauce on some and pizza sauce on others. I also made them a little healthier by using whole wheat flour in the dough.

We got enough dough out of this recipe to make 4 mini pizzas and 2 large pizzas to feed our whole family and still have leftovers!  Everyone got what they wanted-different pizza toppings and types of cheeses.  I made a quick sauce of tomato sauce, oregano,basil, garlic powder and onion powder.  Using 2 small cans, it made enough for all pizzas.  What a great family night activity!

Love! Love! Love! We made these pizzas for family night and my kids had a great time making the dough and then decorating their own spooky designs.  The dough was very easy and quick (perfect with four impatient little ones!) and I was pleasantly surprised with how yummy it tasted!  This has become our official pizza dough recipe!

These were so fun! The dough was so easy and quick to make. We had extra and at first, my brother and sister-in-law were apprehensive about decorating but they were creative superstars! They couldn't be stopped making more that I was very grateful we had extra crusts. And they were quite yummy!

Did two Halloween shapes for these mini pizzas.  Baked the spider pizza completely and then spread a cream cheese-ranch dressing mixture on the top.  The pumpkin pizza was pre-baked, toppings added, and then back into the oven to finish baking.  I think the idea for cutting the pizzas into shapes is sound,  however, my execution left a little to be desired  :-)    Fun anyway.

I love the concept behind this - the kids REALLY enjoyed assembling the pizzas.  It was like arts and crafts with dinner as the reward.  This would be a great idea for parties for children.  Just set out some bowls with different toppings and watch them create!

Since this recipe is mainly about the dough and it's process, and the sauce and toppings are all on you, I have to give it a 5.  Super easy dough to work with-easier than other pizza doughs I've had to work with and roll out.  I didn't measure how much flour I added to make the dough "smooth and elastic," but I'm pretty sure it was more than the additional 1¼ C.  Also, I used the RapidRise yeast.  Just a tip to those new to pizza dough-make your dough circles as thin as you possibly can if you like a thin crust as they puff up a bit during cooking.  Will absolutely use this dough recipe again!

These are such a cute idea for kids.  You can just lay out the ingredients and let their imaginations run!  They dough was easy to put together, but, mine was way too wet.  I had to add quite a bit of flour to form a soft ball.   I was not crazy about how the bottom crust cooked, but, it would probably be better on a pizza stone.

This dough was very easy to work with and I loved it! Even though it seemed like a great recipe for kids to decorate, my husband and I had fun with it. I plan on making some to toss in the freezer for a quick easy dinner.

This was fun for the kids to do, and the adults too! I wasn't thrilled with the crust but it was okay. It lacked flavor and was tougher than I'm used to. Great idea though.

Delicious.  I am gluten-free, so I ended up making a gluten-free dough (with Pamela's Baking and Pancake Mix instead of all-purpose flour).  The result was a fun, delicious gluten-free pizza.  My family loved it!

I let my 13 year old daughter and her friends makes these during a Halloween bonfire/sleepover. They all enjoyed making & eating them. A nice recipe that is easy to make your own.
