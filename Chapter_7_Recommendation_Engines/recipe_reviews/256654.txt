Followed the recipe to a T (subbing in a chopped chipotle pepper) - all I tasted at first was Olive Oil and sugar. Added a ton more lime juice, then all I tasted was olive oil and lime juice. Agreed that it may be a better marinade, but as a salad dressing - no thanks.

I admit, I only used a teaspoon of sugar in this. It was delicious on a salad and complimented pecorino very well. I also used it on a pasta salad. I can see this as a perfect marinade for meats to be grilled, maybe for fajitas or tacos. Next time, I will omit the sugar completely Thank you for the recipe.
