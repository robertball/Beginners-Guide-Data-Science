7/27/06  My girlfriend made this, then called me up saying it did not turn out like mine, after going through the recipe, I asked her what BBQ sauce she used.  She bought Kraft on sale for .77 cents.  Using good BBQ sauce is just as important as using good wine.  Use Jack Daniels or Famous Daves etc.  Stay away from the cheap sauces as they do affect the flavor of the foods. If you don't like sweet, don't use a sweet sauce. 
We really loved this recipe.  If making this during the week, I season chicken with garlic powder, a little salt and pepper add a can of 99% chicken broth and throw in crockpot and cook on low for about 6 to eight hours.  When I get home I drain grease shred chicken and pour rest of ingredients over chicken for about an hour to blend flavors.  I use Famous Daves bold sassy barbeque sauce.  When making on the weekend I cook on high for about four hours, drain, shred chicken and pour rest of ing. over chicken and cook for about two hours more to blend flavors.  I also like to add a little onion and green pepper in the morning then put back into crockpot after draining.   We put it on hoagie rolls or steak rolls  that I brush with olive oil and broil till lightly brown.  Served with a green side salad and fresh cut up veggies and dip.  Yummy Yummy Yummy.  Thanks for the post.

I too used fresh chicken breasts and cooked them on high for 3 hours.  I then shredded the chicken and cooked on low for 1 more hour. (Note: I only used 3 chicken breasts)  I followed the recipe exactly and thought it turned out perfectly.  For those who commented that the sauce was watery - shredding the chicken will help absorb it and make sure you are using a molasses based sauce and not a vinegar based sauce.  I live in Kansas City so we definitely know our BBQ and this turned out great!  Before serving the chicken, I brushed an olive oil and garlic salt mixture on the outside and inside of the bun and broiled for a few minutes until toasty.  I also found a Chipotle Cheddar Cheese by Sargento that was a nice addition.  Finished off with red onion slices.  Will definitely make this again.  Very good reheated too.  UPDATE: With the left over chicken from last night, I made a salad with black beans, corn, onions, and chipotle cheddar cheese.  I added the left over chicken and finished by drizzling a 2 part BBQ sauce, 1 part Ranch dressing mixture over the salad.  Very yummy!

I love this sauce!  The only change I made was to add about 1/2 cup of diced onion and 1 teaspoon of liquid smoke.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's Honey barbecue sauce and the sauce was perfect.  The chicken is wonderful but the recipe also lends itself well to boneless pork ribs.  I threw them in the crockpot and poured the sauce over them.  In about 8 hours I had the most tender, juicy ribs ever!  Used the extra sauce to pour over the ribs once they had been served.  A very big hit!

This recipe is awesome!  It was a huge hit with my family. I thought the Italian Dressing/BBQ sauce combo was a little strage, but it turned out delicious!  The next day, I put the leftover chicken and sauce on a Pillsbury pizza crust with some bacon and mozzarella.  It was the BEST pizza ever!!

I read in "Start a Tradition: Slow Cooker Sunday!" a article on all recipes that. "No frozen meats. Always defrost meats and poultry before placing them in a slow cooker."Other than that little suggestion this recipe is great.

I added about 4 cloves of minced garlic & half a diced onion... my breasts weren't frozen so I only cooked on low for about 4 hours. Then I removed the chicken & shredded it, adding it back to the sauce, along w/ a tbp. or two of Wondra. (It's a non-clumping flour used in sauces & gravies. It's sometimes called "instant flour"). This thickened the sauce up nicely. I stuffed baked potates w/ this & added cheddar cheese & chopped onions. These were better than our local BBQ joint's stuffed potatoes! I served them w/ fresh corn on the cob (nuked) w/ parmesan butter.

Outstanding recipe!  Added 3 cloves of minced garlic, one tbs of liquid smoke and Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory and Brown Sugar BBQ sauce!  To avoid the wateriness of this dish that other reviewers have noted, try using chicken that has not been frozen and adjust your cook time accordingly.  Served on rolls with carmelized onions and choice of cheese with a side of sweet potato fries....  My family of men LOVED this dish!!!  HELPFUL HINT:  Use the leftover chicken on Texas Chicken Quesadillas found on this site.  Outstanding way to use up the leftovers!

YUMMERS! I used Jack Daniels original BBQ sauce, added an onion, sliced, only used 3 large chicken breasts, and per the other reviewers, added some flour about an hour or more before the end of cooking. I didnt want my chicken to dry out so I was doing the 6 hour recipe and had to crank the heat to high for the last 2 hours or my chicken would not have been done. 
I shredded the chicken about an hour before it was done and served it on fresh cibiatta rolls, with pickles and red onions to top them. SERIOUSLY easy and good. Served with sweet potato fries. Everyone licked their plates clean.

I made this last Monday and it came out nice if a bit watery. Next time I will only add half a bottle of BBQ sauce to the crockpot, then add the remainder after I shred it as some other reviewers suggested. It's really good though and has lots of potential.

Oh my Gosh!!!! Can I give this 10 stars? I was looking for an easy recipe one day that didn't require a lot of effort on my part and came across this recipe. I had almost everything needed for it as well, which usually isn't the case with most recipes I find. I LOVE the fact the chicken can be thrown in frozen. I threw 6 frozen breasts in the crockpot, used Sweet Baby Ray's Vidalia Onion BBQ Sauce, the amount of brown suger the recipe calls for, Heinz Worcetershire Sauce, and.....ooops! No Italian dressing! No problem! I substituted Kraft Light Balsamic Vinagrette dressing. I worried how the taste would be affected but it was INCREDIBLE! Next time (and there WILL definitely be a next time,)I may throw in some red onion bits as well.

The sauce came out perfect in consistency as I broke the chicken up when it started getting tender and allowed it to remain in the crockpot to thicken up and absorb the BBQ sauce.

Do yourself a favor and try this!!! You won't be disappointed!

I made this last night and my 7 year old LOVED LOVED LOVED it.  I only had fresh chicken breasts (boneless - I used 5). I cooked it on high for 4 hours and the chicken breasts were tender, but not falling apart. I didn't shred it, as others did, but I'm sure that would be good too.  I used Hickory Smoked Bulls' Eye BBQ sauce and Newman's Italian dressing.  Served with steamed red potatoes & peas.

...And here's to adding to the MULTITUDE of positive reviews this recipe so rightly deserves!  Followed the recipe pretty much to the 't' with the exception of lessening the brown sugar (to about a heaping 1/8 c) to cut back on sweetness and added 4 lg garlic cloves squeezed through garlic press.  Also, (and this is very important to me and others might find this just as important) I did NOT use frozen UNCLEANED chicken breasts.  I could not believe the endless reviews I read where people just plopped their frozen 'uncleaned' chicken breasts into the crock pot without thinking of all the YUCK that will also be included in your dish since it was not trimmed off!  Even if you partially defrost (quickest way is by placing breasts in lg bowl and completely covering with cold water then dumping and replacing the water every 10 - 15 mins) you can then 'clean' your chicken! --a must for us!  With using 6 sm - med size defrosted 'trimmed' chicken breasts, I had no problems with the consistency of the sauce.  It was perfect! Cooked on high for 2 1/2 hrs, and as one reviewer suggested, removed to shred and returned to pot and continued cooking for an addt'l 45 mins to meld.  I used Kraft Zesty Italian and 12.5 oz of 'Sweet Baby Ray's' original bbq sauce.  Served on toasted 'Francisco International' French sandwich rolls! (with bread & butter pickles on side).  Unbelievably delicious!  Seriously, will never need to go 'out' for a bbq fix again.  For sure 'restaurant quality' at home!

Fantastic!!!  My wife is not really even fond of BBQ.  Well she said this recipe was a keeper!  I took heavily in consideration the two “Most Helpful” reviews.  First I used Sweet Baby Ray’s Original BBQ sauce.  I can see that a subpar sauce would really mangle this recipe.

As per the suggestion, I used fresh chicken breasts, used the same other ingredients as per the recipe and added 1 cup of diced onions.  Cooked for three hours on high, shredded the chicken and then put on low for one hour. Wow!  This will definitely be on rotation.  Oh and my picky three year old loooooooved it!

Enjoy and thanks for the recipe!

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars for it's basic idea and simplicity. But I changed it up, made it even simpler, and even more yummy (if I dare say so!) Forget the other ingredients, all you need is the frozen chicken, a large bottle (or 2 med. bottles) of your favorite bbq sauce, some brown sugar, and a dash of your favorite all-purpose seasoning.   I used 4 large frozen skinless breasts, added somewhere between 14-16+ oz of Sweet Baby Ray's Original BBQ Sauce (the best!), 1/4 cup of light brown sugar, and 1 TSP of Spice World's Cajun Blackening Seasoning, but any all-purpose seasoning would do. No pre-cooking stirring necessary, just dump it all in on top of the chicken. Cook on low 3-5 hrs, then while chicken's still in crockpot, gently shred/pull apart using 2 forks. Let simmer on low for another hour (or several, depending on your timeframe) and remove crock from heat and stir. Sauce will thicken as it cools/stops boiling. BEST pulled bbq sandwiches our family's ever eaten! This is my husband's new favorite meal. Tip 1: If near eating time your sauce seems super watery, remove lid for half an hour. Tip 2: The quality of your bbq sauce directly translates to the quality / flavor of your chicken, so choose it wisely! Tip 3: Freezes great in Ziploc bags!

The recipe has potential, but the time is off. I cooked it on low for 8 hours, and the sauce was burned and the chicken was all dried out. If the time was lessened, I think it would cook well, but do not use the higher times suggested.

Soooo easy and soooo tasty! GREAT! Some wrote that the sauce was a little watery. Try defrosting the chicken before cooking (actually this should be done anyway) and shred the chicken after about 3 hours on high and then cook the shredded chicken on low for about an hour.

This is awesome. Even better the next day. I will make this again and again. Be sure to shred your chicken meat and it will thicken (absorb) the sauce. I added some minced garlic to it. I will make this again! Thank you for the recipe!

I read the reviews & knew I didn't want shredded chicken, so I decided to bake it it the oven instead. I prepared the chicken in a 13x9 & covered it with foil & put it in the fridge for a few hours. Then baked at 375 covered for 30 minutes & uncovered for 15. (spooned sauce over after removing foil.) Everyone loved it & the chicken was tender. (it was fresh chicken, not frozen) Thanks for submitting!

I used fresh chicken (not frozen) and only BBQ sauce (KC Masterpiece) and Lite Italian Dressing. I cooked the chicken for 4 hours and let it sit 'warm' for a few hours. When I got home from work I shredded the chicken in the pot and then let it sit a bit longer, though it really only needed about 10 mins. It was AWESOME!!!!   I baked sweet potatoes and put the chicken on top. Add some veggies and you've got a great easy meal. Even my picky toddler loved it and now we have food for tomorrow!

We make this often. Here is what I do differently: At the beginning, only add half of the BBQ sauce. When the chicken is fully cooked remove it from the crockpot and shred it with a fork then add the rest of the BBQ sauce.

I just threw 2 cups thawed leftover turkey from T-day that was in the freezer into a skillet and then put about 2.3 bottle of HP (British brand) honey barbecue sauce, 3 TBL brown sugar, 1/3 cup italian dressing and 1 generous TBL of worcestershire sauce. Let it cook together for 45 mins and turned out perfect.

I had fresh chicken, not frozen but otherwise kept everything the same. This was absolutely delicious! The taste was amazing and the house smelt wonderful. Will definitely make this again, so simple.

This was my first ever crock pot recipe, and it was a big hit.  I used chicken thighs, and after six hours on high, pulled the bones out, shredded the meat, and let cook for another hour.  It was delicious.  I did however leave out the brown sugar, and I'm glad I did.  It was still very sweet.

Easy and tasty. I used unfrozen chicken breasts and only used 3 large.  Like other reviewers suggested, I used half bottle of (12 oz) BBQ sauce for the mix then cooked on HIGH for 3 hours - shredded chicken and then added the rest of the BBQ sauce and cooked on LOW for 1 more hour.  Came out tender and perfectly sauced, not watery or runny at all.

Made this recipe exactly as written; although I did cut the recipe in half, since it’s the two of us. I only use Sweet Baby Ray’s BBQ sauce so of course it was delicious!  I highly suggest using this BBQ sauce, no others come close; and I am picky with my sauces.  I can’t believe how easy this tasty meal was to prepare and cook, the flavor payoff was awesome.  I used three thawed chicken breast, cooked it on low and after 3 hours I shredded it and then returned it to the crockpot to cook for another 1.5 hours.    The sauce was perfect, not runny at all! Not too savory and not too sweet…perfect!  I piled the chicken on top of lightly toasted King’s Hawaiian rolls, and paired with corn on the cob. Fantastic recipe, zero flaws.

This was extremely easy and very good.  I loved the idea of using frozen chicken.  No need to thaw it first just throw it all in the crock pot!  Be sure to freeze your chicken breasts separately!  I mixed up the sauce the night before and in the morning just put it all together.  I doubled the sauce ingredients and used 10 chicken breasts.  It cooked on low for about 11 hours.  It did seem a little dry when it was still whole, but by the time I shredded the breasts and put them back into the sauce, it melted in your mouth.    I served it open faced on bulkie rolls with a slice of provolone and a slice of cheddar cheese on the roll first.  This would be a great recipe for a summer BBQ!  Be sure to use a good sauce as stated before.  I used Jack Daniels and it was just delicious.  Thanks for a real keeper!

Wow. This was fantastic.  I used 4 large, fresh chicken breasts, 20 oz of BBQ sauce, 1 cup of Fat Free Italian Salad Dressing, 1/2 cup Brown Sugar and 2 TBS of Worcestershire sauce.  I cooked the chicken 5 hours on low before shredding and then putting back in the croclkpot with the sauce. Then I let it cook on the warm setting for about another 45 mins. It was perfect. This one goes in my keeper file.

This was amazing!! I have a smaller crockpot so i used 3 good sized fresh chicken breasts. Mixed the other ingredients like the recipe suggested and poured over the chicken. It cooked on high for 3 hours then i pulled the chicken apart & let it sit for another 30 mins (unplugged). I was surprised to see so many people say it was watery because mine was the perfect thickness. I used a 16oz bottle of origional Jack Daniels BBQ sauce so im not sure if that made a difference. I will definitely make this again.

Easy, impressive, and TASTES AND SMELLS delicious while cooking!  I can't wait to try different barbq sauces with it.  I used Jack Daniels sauce and also shredded the chicken 6 hours into cooking on low and served it at 7 hours of cooking.  After shredding the chicken (which fell apart upon touching it with the fork!), the dish really came together- it was no longer runny and the taste really melded.  Shredding the chicken is absolutely a must for this dish.  Thank you!

Quite good...very simple.  Contrary to what appears to be popular opinion here, a "non-gourmet" BBQ sauce tastes just as good in this recipe as a more expensive brand.  I do not use the brown sugar called for in this recipe since my wife felt it was too sweet when prepared that way previously but I do add about 2 heaping teaspoons of minced garlic to enhance the flavor.  After cooking I pour about 1/2 of the sauce back over the pulled chicken, mix together and serve this to those in the family who want a milder BBQ flavor.  For the rest of us I take the remaining sauce and add cayenne pepper, black pepper, and apple cider vinegar to taste and drizzle this over each sandwich.  This moves the sandwich eastward in the direction of a NC BBQ flavor.  A shot of Texas Pete or your favorite pepper sauce does no harm on these fine sandwiches.  Nor does a batch of slaw or tater salad as a side.  You will find no need to go out to eat BBQ chicken sandwiches if you prepare this recipe.  This recipe alone makes the purchase of a slow cooker well worth the investment.  It is a low effort, sure thing for picnics, socials or bowl games.  After about 2 hours the smell of the BBQ in your home will become almost irresistible.

So good! I scaled the recipe back to 3 servings and used thawed chicken breasts. Cut back on the sugar and used Al's BBQ sauce (recipe from this site). Cooked on high for 3 hours, then shredded and topped on a baked potato! This would be delicious in a wrap.

Great recipe - thanks!  I cooked frozen breasts in broth for 2 hours on high and then added BBQ mixture and cooked on high for another 1.5 hours.  Then I shredded the chicken and cooked for 30 minutes more.  Turned out perfectly, and my husband loved it!  We added some hot sauce for an extra kick.

So easy and delicious!  Used fresh breasts and didn't add the brown sugar (didn't want it to be too sweet), like others recommended I took chicken out after 3 hours on high, shredded it with 2 forks and put it back in for an additional hour on high.  I did add about 2 tablespoons of flour before the final hour and it thickened up to the consistency I was going for.  Didn't miss the brown sugar at all.  This will definitely become a part of our regular rotation.  Thanks for such a tasty and simple recipe.

I did a twist on this one..a bag of frozen chicken tenders and I seasoned them with garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper and put them in the crockpot.  Sliced a large onion and tossed it with the chicken and put in a bottle of Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce and let it cook for 5 hours on low, shredded the chicken and let it sit on warm for another hour.  It was not watery at all so there was no need to drain it.  We loved it!  Served it on texas toast with corn on the cob and homemade cole slaw...DELICIOUS!

Most commercially prepared BBQ sauces already have a lot of brown sugar or other kind of sweetener.  I would have preferred this without the extra brown sugar because it made the chicken a bit too sweet.

If you haven't made this Please Do!  If you have then Make This Again!  Fantastic!  Out of this world!  Words can not describe!  Enough.  This was great.  I used Bulls Eye original B-B-Q sauce and thawed chicken tenders.  Cooked on low in my Rival Avocado Green slow cooker.  Yep it still works!  Shredded the chicken after three hours and put it back in the pot for an additional hour.  Served on buns.  Please try this simple and delicious meal!

Great taste and super easy!  I used a 3lb bag of frozen "chicken tenders" (no, not the breaded ones!), and Sweet Baby Ray's barbeque sauce (that's just an FYI, not a suggestion). I added three teaspoons of chopped garlic, a large white onion minced and about a tablespoon and 1/2 of dried mustard. I made these additions because I thought it was too sweet when I sampled the sauce. (Another brand might be more on the tangy side, but I worked with what I had on hand.)

After the chicken was falling-apart done, I removed it from the pot and did a simple reduction of the sauce (just boil it down to the consistency you want). I broke the meat into chunks instead of shredding it and served it on hard rolls.

To the people who commented that the sauce was "runny" or "thin"... I feel the blame is more on the part of the water injected into the chicken and not the recipe.... if you read the info on the package, almost all chicken is "water added"..... unless you are freinds with a chicken farmer and can get it fresh and "unprocessed", we just have to deal with that and adjust.

I made this recipe and only changed it by adding a dash of hot sauce. It came out awesome. The next night I added a small can of mexican corn & a can of blk beans, put it in a tortilla & topped it with shredded cheese. It was as good, if not better, than the original recipe & a very easy dinner. I will definitely be making this again & again. so simple to make & very good!!

Loved it! Yum! I followed the recipe exactly, using a Honey Mustard BBQ sauce. Although I did as one other review suggested and added some extra BBQ sauce at the end for thickening instead of cornstarch, and it was perfect, the extra BBQ sauce is the secret! All of the other BBQ Chicken recipes I have tried in the past were never good, and always seemed to be missing something. Well, this one is "THE" recipe, and I will happily make this over and over again. This is perfect and a total winner, we all loved it, thank you!!!

YUMMMM!!!! I received this recipe in my "Daily Dish" e-newsletter yesterday and boy I'm glad I made it. It was very easy and so delicious!!! My husband raved about it and asked when we could have it again! Even my 21 month old son gobbled it up and asked for more. As for changes, I actually didn't have italian dressing on-hand because I usually make my own balsamic dressing, so I used the ingredients from the balsamic dressing instead (balsamic vinegar, olive oil and a touch of mustard). And for the Canadians in the group, I used President's Choice (Loblaws) brand extra spicy barbecue sauce and added a touch of Louisiana hot sauce to give it some kick.

I did not like this recipe, at all.  The sauce was watery and oily and had a sour flavor (probably a result of adding the salad dressing), and the meat ended up VERY dry.  I've had better results just slow cooking in plain BBQ sauce, or poaching the chicken and then topping with warm BBQ sauce.  I would not recommend this recipe.  Sorry!

This is one of those recipes that when you first look at it, you wonder why someone would put these ingredients together.  I was desperate to find something to make for dinner at 1:30 pm that I could quickly throw in the slow cooker.  I used four skinless frozen chicken breasts and then mixed the other ingredients over the top and put it on low for a few hours.  My son and his two cousins were my dinner guests and they devoured all of the chicken possibly faster than I have seen them eat anything and asked for more! Great recipe!

I used 4 fresh chicken breasts (not frozen), Newman's Italian dressing, and Sweet Baby Ray's Original BBQ sauce.  The BBQ sauce came in an 18 ounce bottle and I think I put about 15 ounces in and saved the rest for serving on the side.  I followed the rest of the recipe ingredients exactly.  I cooked on high for 3 hours (maybe 3 hours and 20 minutes because I was late getting back home from errands).  Then I took the chicken out and shredded it with two forks.  It was super tender and already falling apart, so that was easy to do.  Then I put the shredded chicken back in and cooked on low another hour.  It absorbed almost all of the sauce after being shredded and it tasted amazing!  We had it on thicker gourmet hamburger buns with coleslaw and sweet potato fries.  The next day we made BBQ chicken pizza.  Delicious!  I'm making it again this weekend.  Might try the hickory and brown sugar sauce this time since our guests like sweeter BBQ.

Best pulled chicken I have ever had. I made a couple of modifications. I used 2 lbs of fresh chicken breast (not frozen), sweet baby ray's hickory and brown sugar sauce, and Ken's light italian dressing. I cooked everything on high for 3 hours, shredded the chicken, then cooked for another hour on low. I definitely recommend using those dressings/sauces. The other recipe reviews recommended that you stay away from Kraft BBQ sauce. The sauce will make or break this recipe. It's super important to shred the chicken and continue cooking. The chicken soaks up all the sauce that way. It was a bit "saucy", but that was great over rice. Leftover are even better.

This recipe is so very delicious!  I was thrilled when I discovered I had everything on hand, including the benefit of using frozen chicken breasts. That is so convenient for a busy mom.  The sauce is better than any I have had in a very long time.  The best part, my incredibly picky kids ate it all..there was not a drop left and that is the truth. I served it over bow tie pasta instead of on buns and that was a hit too.  Thanks so much for a new favorite!

M;y family and I love this recipe SO much that I make it all the time. First time I made it I had reservations about putting Italian dressing in and thought it actually smelled funny about 3 or 4 hours into the cooking process.  However, it turned out fantastic.  I make it exactly as the recipe calls for, using KC Masterpiece Hickory Brown Sugar bbq sauce and fat-free italian dressing.  I bake jumbo baked potatoes, top them with butter, shredded cheddar cheese and this chicken shredded and some extra sauce drizzled on top.  Can I say it again??  FANTASTIC! Think I will make it again tonight........

I didn't make this for myself, I made it for my friend and he LOVED it. It's definitely important to use a bbq sauce that you love. I used a spicy tandoori bbq sauce. I'll make this again for sure. It couldn't be easier.

I make this one weekly. This is the best slow cooker BBQ chicken. Make sure to shred the chicken about an hour before its done so it soaks up all of the sauce.

Like some other reviewers mine was watery.  I shredded the chicken and it was still watery.  The sauce was tasty and chicken was sooo tender.

I LOVE LOVE this recipe!  I use Heinz57 for the BBQ sauce. I have forwarded it to more people than I can count. I have served it on  rolls, rice, potatos.. all good. I have made it ahead of time and frozen it!  I make it with boneless breasts and pull it apart like pulled pork! Incredible!!!

Very delicious and very easy.  I added a little garlic powder to mine and it turned out great!  A lot of reviewers said that you must SHRED the chicken but I didn't and it turned out great.  I think it works great both ways!  Thanks!!

This gets 5 stars for being so easy..I used chicken breasts with ribs and adjusted the time. About 6 to 7 hours on low..I used a good quality barbeque sauce and it was very good..Not at all dry like it can get on the grill..Thanks Zanne :^)

I used 4 large frozen chicken breasts and followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  I used Sweet Baby Rays and Wishbone Italian Dressing.  I put on low for about 7 hours, shredded chicken and then left the lid off for another hour.  The sauce thickened up nicely and my husband ate 3 of those wonderful bbq chicken buns.  I, too, would have never thought about putting italian dressing in with bbq sauce.  Thank you so much for this easy, great recipe.  I'll be making again.

Oh My Gosh. This was the best BBQ chicken I have ever eaten. The only thing I did different was used fresh chicken breasts and cooked on low for 4 hours. I shredded the chicken and put back in the sauce for another hour. I used Baby Rays BBQ sauce and it didn't come out watery at all. Delicious!

Best next day. Followed recipe exactly. We liked it, husband loved it. As for reviews saying it's watery, it is, but if you shred the chicken when it's cooked through, and let it cook a bit longer with the lid off, the chicken will soak up most of the juices.

You can make this in 2 hours or less! The night before, I thawed frozen chicken tenders in the microwave, rinsed & dried them, and put them in the croc pot with all of the other ingredients and put in the fridge. This took no time at all. The next afternoon when I got home, I put the croc pot on high and cooked for about 75 minutes. I took 2 forks and shredded the chicken right in the pot, and let it simmer on low an additional 30 minutes. It was perfect! I saw another reviewer's advice to get GOOD quality BBQ sauce, but I used what I had on hand and it was a bit thin. Next time I'll use better sauce and it will be perfect. Oh, and I added some crushed red pepper because we like spicy. Thanks for this easy, tasty recipe!

I doubled the recipe to take to work for our christmas party. Served on serve and bake rolls that I prepared the night before.   I did add some hot sauce to give a little more kick as the bbq sauce was a little mellow.  I also defrosted the chicken breast in the microwave and cut them in half before adding them to the slow cooker.  This was devoured.  Would def make again.

I tried this tonight. Took most peoples advice,put fresh chicken breasts in crock pot on high for about 3.5 hours. Drained it and shredded the chicken...then poured the sauce over the chicken and put on low for an hour. I bought higher quality BBQ sauce and Italian Dressing. (Weber's Sweet and Thick. Ken's Steak House Italian with Romano cheese) Served on potato buns with Potato salad. HUGE HIT!!!! This is a keeper.

I omitted brown sugar because I was already using a hickory and brown sugar bbq sauce, and didn't want it too sweet. It was perfect that way! For dinner we put the chicken on Hawaiian sweet rolls with some heated up french fried onions. So good! Following day we used the leftovers to make bbq chicken salads for lunch, which was also good

This has become one of my go-to dinner recipes! So easy to just put the chicken in the crock pot, shred, and put on some buns. LOVE the flavor. I've gotten a lot of compliments on it whenever I've made it. I use fresh chicken breasts and cook on low for 7-8 hours. I usually shred the chicken an hour before I take it out. I have cooked it on high for 4-5 hours when I'm in a hurry and it's just as juicy/flavorful.

Very good!  I followed a few of the other reviews and I used Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce and fresh chicken breasts.  I cooked the chicken in chicken broth on high for 2 1/2 hours.  Shredded it, drained the pot and added the rest of the ingredients, minus the brown sugar, plus some diced onions and green peppers.  Simmered for another 1 1/2 hours on low.  Toasted the buns and served.

This is the kind of recipe that would seem easy enough, however it's recipes like this that are not specific and can create a disaster. If you use just any barbecue sauce, it will come out terrible! I followed the recipe exactly and it was awful! It tasted like the sauce probably was not made for such long cooking. I couldnt get anyone to eat it. So sad, and glad it wasn't something I had slaved over. Also, adding brown sugar maybe also played a part in the disaster. It would have been helpful if it explained what brand of BBQ sauce to use. Either way, I won't be using this one again.

This was very tasty. I made the recipe as is, except with 4 breasts instead of 6, and it came out with the perfect amount of sauce. So, if you're going to make it with all 6 breasts and like this dish a little moister, I'd suggest adding in some more of the wet ingredients. I seasoned the chicken with s&p before pouring the sauce over, and also added in 3 cloves of garlic (minced), but I'm sure the dish would taste just great without those adjustments!

My 6 chicken breasts were huge (something like 2 1/2 pounds in all) so I did one and a half times the recipe.  My chicken was thawed and only took 3 1/2 hours to cook on low, wow.  Like others, I shredded the chicken at that point, turned the heat to high, and removed the lid so some of the liquid could cook off for 1 hour.  This was a good call because it would have been very watery otherwise.  We really, really liked the resulting sandwiches which is good because it made a lot!

Gave this to my daughter and a friend (very picky eater) for dinner.  They said, "We don't like this... We LOVE it!".  Followed the recipe as indicated but did not use frozen chicken.  Will definitely make this again.

Very easy to prepare. Like some of the other reviewers, I was concerned about the amount of liquid left over, but once I shredded the chicken, it turned out just right!  I backed this down to 3 serving, and I also served it with white rice since my wife was not in the mood for a sandwich.  It turned out really well.  Easy to prepare, quick cleanup, and great taste!  I'll definitely be making this one again on those days that we run short on time.

Good, but do not use chicken breasts.  Meat comes out dry.  Try using chicken thighs.

Wow! Unbelievable simple process for the end result.  I had my doubts about using frozen chicken breasts but it really worked out. Don't use a cheap-o bbq sauce as this recipe is mostly sauce and quality counts. Served over mashed potatoes topped with sour cream & chives. Easy meal at the end of your day.

What an awesome recipe!!! I bought about 2lbs of fresh boneless skinless chicken breast (did not use frozen)~ put in my crock-pot seasoned with garlic salt and onion powder~poured the mixture over the chicken(I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce)~on high for about 3 1/2 hours then took the lid off shredded the chicken stirred really good to incorporate the sauce~ put the lid on for about another 1/2 hour. My husband ate his over a baked potatoe sprinkled with cheese and chives (AWESOME) I ate mine on a pretzel roll (AWESOME) Later that night I made BBQ chicken nachos (FREAKIN AWESOME) I will make this all the time!!! I gave the recipe to my mom and she is going to make it tomorrow with some boneless pork-chops she has in the freezer~ so we will see how it turns out. Thanks for a great recipe :)

Holy Moly! I can't believe how tender this chicken turned out. I actually felt like I could cook after I made this. I have never had chicken that was so tender. I follow some other suggestions and added a little cayenne (we like it spicy), garlic, onions, and some liquid smoke. It turned out awesome. I can't wait to try it with different kinds of BBQ sauce. Oh, and I did add a little flour towards the last half hour to thicken up the sauce. Perfect, perfect, perfect! I can't get over how easy it is to make great chicken!

So easy and so good!!  As suggested by other reviewers - I cooked the chicken in the slow cooker in chicken broth for 4 hours (I used fresh chicken).  I then drained the broth, shredded the chicken, combined the other ingredients and added to the chicken,  and cooked another 45 minutes - 1 hr.  This was very flavorful.  The next day I used the left chicken to make a barbeque pizza - shredded chicken, red onions, cilantro, and mozzarella.  My husband really liked it on a sandwich - but LOVED it on the pizza. (One tip - I am not crazy about the dough they have in the grocery store and I almost never make it from scratch.  I go to my local pizza parlor and buy uncooked pizza dough - stretch it out into the pan and your done!  It is so much better and enough dough for a large pizza only costs me $ 2.50.)

This recipe is fabulous and so easy. We put the chicken on sesame seed buns and served it with black beans. Everyone raved over the delicious flavor. I used KC Masterpiece Hickory Brown Sugar BBQ Sauce and it was perfect. This recipe is definitley a keeper!

This would be okay for 2 hours in slow cooker on low. But, after 6, this was sooo dry! And, imagine cooking bbq sauce for 6 hours?! It lost all its flavour and turned into a bad tasting sauce because it had cooked for too long on low. After 2 hours it tasted fine, but longer and it tough.

This was great! I used this sauce for country ribs instead (slow cooker) and it was the best. I used KC masterpiece.
Thanks for the recipe.

This is always a big hit at parties!  I have made this several times and have followed the recipe exactly.  I now reduce the brown sugar by half because I use Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce and its already sweet.  I also now use a mix of breast & boneless thighs.  The last time I made this was for a BBQ so I prepared it in the crock pot the day before, shredded the meat (be careful not to over-shred or your meat will look like mush), then put it in a foil pan overnight with a little extra sauce on top.  At the BBQ we just heated the pan on the grill for a little while and it was ready to eat.  I put mini-rolls out next to the pan of meat so everyone could have a mini-sandwich and save room for all the other BBQ food at the party.

3 hours on high, shred and return to pot for an hour on low. If you get anywhere near 8 hrs on low, just go out to dinner and use the chicken breasts for door stops.

This is absolutely amazing.  Very similar to KFC bbq chicken sandwiches.  The sauce is excellent.  Make sure you use Sweet Baby Ray's.  I also used Kraft Zesty Italian Dressing.

Works great in a pressure cooker too!

Used all of the ingredients as written to make sure that it was a fair rating in terms of taste (Dave's Sassy barbecue, Kraft zesty Italian, light brown sugar and L & P worchestershire).

Although it was a little too sweet for me which I knew it would be, I really believe in using as written to be accurate - this would be just the right amount of sweetness for about 90% of my friends and family.

The reason that I used the pressure cooker was that I wanted to use frozen chicken and don't really trust using frozen in the slow cooker - also wanted to experiment to see if this could be cooked as a quick meal if something unexpected comes up. 

I pressure cooked from frozen for 20 minutes in chicken broth, shredded the chicken after draining, added the mixture as listed and cooked on high pressure for an additional 15 minutes - worked great for the "harried and in a hurry cook"!

Hope this is a help to someone who didn't have time to put it in the slow cooker.

This was sooo good. I put it in the crock pot before I went to work on a Saturday morning and five hours later I came home to an awesome lunch! Seriously this was amazing. I added a teaspoon of liquid smoke like another person suggested and used a spicy barbeque sauce (I forget the brand, but knowing how I shop it was probably a store brand!) and it was tangy, spicy, and full of flavor. My boyfriend couldn't get enough of it. This will definitely be added to our regular weekend lunches/dinners!

This is really good. I recommend using fresh chicken because the frozen retains a lot of water and the sauce was a little watery at the end. Also I would cook it on low instead of high. I'll definitely make this again- great sauce!!!!!

We thought this was ok. It needed some salt and pepper at the end and we still thought the sauce was too tangy. Next time I would add garlic and onions I think. But it was very easy and convenient since I had everything on hand for this.

SO delicous!!  I cut it down to just 2 chicken breasts for my husband and I and wished I'd made more for leftovers.  Used Original Sweet Baby Rays and put on fresh potato dinner rolls.  I will FOR SURE make this again.  Super easy and wonderful flavor.

I listened to the other reviewers and used Sweet Baby Ray's and shredded the chicken.  This recipe was soooo amazing!!!  I will be making it at the end of the month for my family reunion.  It is so easy and delicious.  I made a huge batch and froze the leftovers.  I won't do that again - it didn't freeze well.  Just another reason to eat more (in addition to it being so good) when it's done!

An easy, excellent, flavorful recipe.  I cook for two, so I used 3 fresh chicken breasts, half a bottle of high quality BBQ sauce, and the full measurements for the rest of the ingerdients.  I then cooked it on high for 3 hours, shredded the breasts, added about half the remaining BBQ sauce to the slow cooker, the cooked it for another hour on low.  Tasty and simple!  Shredding Tip: I burned my fingertips way too many times before I learned to use two forks to pull the chicken apart intead of my fingerss!

I've made this a few times and totally love it!  My husband and I live in an apartment and cannot have a grill..so this is about as close as we can get to BBQ :)   This recipe is easy, has a few inexpensive ingredients, and cooks on its own!  How great it that?! I follow the recipe exactly and have been very pleased with the turnout.  I'm often surprised at how many people change recipes completely and then rate a recipe.. I think that misleads others as to how good/bad the recipe is.  This is one of those recipes that's simple and tasty enough to make the way its stated...okay sorry, that was a bit of a rant ;)   I usually use Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and make a bottle of Good Seasons Italian dressing for the dressing in the recipe.. I think the GS italian gives it more of a spicier taste than store bought bottled dressing. I do not, however, put the chicken in frozen.. I completely thaw it and than put it in the crock pot.  I've used chicken breast tenderloins and chicken breasts.. I'm curious to see how chicken thighs would be with this. Friends of mine even used this recipe as a dish at their daughter's christening party as it hold in the crock pot nicely. I served mine on ciabatta rolls. Will make again and again!  Try it, you'll love it!

This was such a nice easy camping recipe.  I dumped everything in the crock pot and forgot all about it until we were hungry enough to eat.  I followed the recipe as is, though I doubled it to have enough to cover my 6-8 smallish chicken breasts.  I don't like BBQ, so I didn't eat any, but my DH and 2 dinner guests all raved about it and were looking forward to leftovers, so I'm going to have to say it's a keeper.  I really like how easy it is!  TY!

This is delicious!  I followed the submitters advice to use frozen chicken, cooked on low for 5 hours, shredded, then returned to the sauce for another hour.  This is so EASY!  I will make again and again.  Update: I have made this often, and have found that when you use frozen breasts the sauce ends up too thin.  I also found halving the brown sugar and worch. sauce suits our tastes better.  I only use Sweet Baby Rays bbq sauce, for me there is no compromising, the sauce makes this recipe delicious!

Made this and the whole family loved it. I used 5 drumsticks (juicier than breasts) and balsamic vinaigrette (no Italian in the fridge). Cooked on high 2 hours, then low 2 hours. Then in 350 degree oven uncovered 40 minutes with a bit of sauce. Reduced the sauce a bit to thicken in crockpot during 40 min. Only thing left over is the sauce that I'll use to make mashed potatoes pretty. Thanks!

I followed the recipe exactly and the chicken came out perfectly.  The chicken tasted like I spent the entire day slaving over it, but in reality I only spent about 20 minutes total prepping it and shredding it a few hours later. I cooked this on Low for 4 hours before removing it to shred it. After returning the shredded chicken to the slow cooker I chose to turn the temperature setting to High for an hour and a half because lifting the lid on a slow cooker drastically drops the temperature and it takes quite a long time to bring it back up. I set the temperature back down to Low for the remaining two and a half hours. The chicken was extremely moist and full of flavor. The only change I will make to it in the future will be to thicken the sauce a bit... otherwise, this was perfect!

Incredibly easy and really good. Uses ingredients I usually have on hand. Great served with rice to soak up some of the sauce.

This was a very easy recipe and delicious too.  My husband loved it.  I do think that the key ingredient is a good barbeque sauce.

Fantastic recipe. I have made this at least 8 times and loved it each and every time. This is the only recipe that my husband and son ask for. I even take my crock pot to Florida so I can make it there, over the winter. I do not change a thing, and it turns out perfect....even had it for dinner today and when our son found out, he joined us as this is one of his all time favorites.

I have made this recipe many times, and it I'd delicious. I was unsure about the Italian dressing when I first read the recipe, but I am glad I didn't change it because it added a nice taste. Very good, wouldn't change a thing. I use Sticky Fingers Carolina sweet BBQ sauce.

Made this exactly as stated, except used fresh chicken breasts instead of frozen.  Cooked on low for about 5 hours and it was spectacular.   The picky eaters of the family raved about it.

I have made this recipe exactly as written a few times at the suggestion of my mom who tried it first, and we all love it! The first two times I just served it on buns right out of the crock pot, but a week ago I strained the shredded chicken so it wouldn't make the bread so soggy, and made sandwiches on buttered and grilled sourdough. I covered them with cheese, popped them under the broiler for a few to melt it, then topped them with onions, pickles, anything you want, and used the extra sauce and some ranch for dipping. My husband was impressed and full, and it was easy and delicious. I will agree with others that the bbq sauce you use will greatly affect the flavor of the chicken, I have used a couple of different sauces and I am going to try a new one next time. :)

My husband loved this! He kept saying how good it was while he was eating it, which makes any wife proud. :) I only used 3 fresh chicken breasts (which was the perfect amount) and Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ. I somehow left the store with Italian dressing, but it wasn't in the bag when I got home, so I just made my own. It turned out great! Not sure how it'll taste with store-bought Italian dressing, but I'm excited to find out when I try this recipe again. :)

This is amazing!! Super easy to follow and make. Perfect for hot days or when you're going to be gone all day. My family loved it! I loved it! We are definitely having this again. I followed the recipe mixture exactly and cooked it on low for about 4 hours then shredded the meat and cooked for another hour. It turned out delicious. The meat was moist the sauce was great. We topped it with a little cheese and ate it in a tortilla. Also yummy with a little ranch on it.

This recipe is quick and easy to put together and is really moist and flavorful. My husband absolutely loves it and it's now on the menu weekly (the leftovers are equally as good the next day too)! I usually halve the ingredients, which serves 3, omit the sugar, cook on low (and have used both frozen and fresh chicken, both come out great) and shred the chicken at about 4.5-5 hours. The edges do start to burn a little if you leave it on for 7-8 hours (which can make this recipe a challenge if you're trying to cook it while away at work all day!). I was a little short on Italian dressing last time and the end result was still delicious. I do recommend using a decent BBQ sauce because it does make a difference. I recently cooked on high for 4 hours, and it was still a winner. Anyone hesitating to make the recipe due to comments about thickening - I found that if I didn't open the lid to check on it more than once to give it a little stir, I didn't need to thicken it; shredding it quickly with a steak knife and fork at around 5 hours (low) did the trick to absorb any extra sauce.

This recipe is so simple and so delicious. I used Famous Dave's Zesty & Sweet (I think that's the name) for the BBQ sauce. I've also made this with pork instead of chicken, and it was even better than the chicken. I used a pork tenderloin so that I wouldn't have to try to skim off a lot of fat. Maybe two-thirds of the way through, I removed the tenderloin from the crock pot and used two forks to shred the meat, then I returned the meat to the slow cooker and let it soak up the sauce. My husband said this is one of his favorites of all the dishes I've made.

This is one of the best BBQ sandwich recipes I've tried.  I didn't change anything about it and loved the flavor! I used Hickory Smoke Kraft BBQ sauce and liked it a lot! I guess if I was going to change anything, I would add a little liquid smoke, but if you use a smokey BBQ sauce, you don't need it.  
The sauce was a little thin for my liking (probably cause I stuck in the chicken completely frozen).  To fix that, I put the crockpot on high with the lid off for about 2 hours and it reduced down great!

Fantastic! I did 9 breasts, because it made a lot of bbq juice. I also added finely chopped onion & bell pepper at the beginning. I toasted kaiser buns. This recipe is off the hook, winner winner chicken dinner! my best compliments to Zanne Tastic! Thank you so much!!!

This is an amazingly great recipe!  The secret to having this so yummy is using some GREAT BBQ sauce.......either Sweet Baby Rays or Jack Daniels....and use good italian dressing.  It makes all the difference in how this recipe turns out.  Put on big fluffy onion rolls and it was a huge hit!

Super simple.  And, so little time in the kitchen in the 100 degree weather we're having now. I used Olive Garden's Italian Salad Dressing and I wish I had left it out.  Might try with a different Italian brand next time.  But, Sweet Baby Ray's Original Sauce is perfect and I can't imagine an addition making it better.  Thank you for a great recipe to beat this heat!!

Hands down the BEST barbecue chicken I have ever had in my life! I cooked the chicken in the crockpot then about an hour before finished I used 2 forks and shredded it in the crockpot. I have put the chicken in frozen as well as thawed and both taste delicious. The frozen chicken was more watery than the thawed but the flavors were still delicious. This dish makes so much for my husband and I so we freeze some and thaw for a quick dinner later as well as save some for our lunches the next day. This chicken barbecue is SO good!

Excellent. I follow the recipe exactly and it turns out perfectly ever time. Don't spend money on the expensive cuts. The fat melts to the bottom of the crockpot, and you remove the meat from it. If you use a leaner cut, it does not stay as moist.

Wow! What a treat!!! so easy and yummy.  I used fresh chicken, followed the rest of the recipe and shredded the chicken. It mixed in perfectly with the sauce. Cooked on low one more hour and served on whole grain rolls with garlic roasted red skinned potatoes and salad.

This was just awesome! I can't wait to make for company. I followed another person's suggestion to put the chicken in 1 cup brother for 3 hours until able to shred it. Drained and put in the rest of the ingredients plus onions and cooked for another 2-3 hours on low. Serve on tortillas with mozzarella cheese.

This is one of my favorite recipes on the website and I've made it several times, with good success each time.  I love it, but it's also the first time I'd ever made barbecue.  For some reason I was scared to make barbecue (I live in the south so I know what it should taste like - a little intimidating!) but even without a smoker or grill, I could make tasty, zesty, SHREDDED barbecue at home in my crock pot!  Love this recipe!

This recipe turned out great! I used Jack Daniels Original BBQ sauce, and I added a bit more Italian Dressing and Worcheshire sauce just to suit my taste. It turned out wonderfully and everyone loved it! I will definitely make this again! Next time I might try to cut down on the brown sugar, just to see what it does. We ate this over white rice along with corn and potatoe salad and texas toast.

Made it this afternoon, ate it on a baked potato.  Stuck to the recipe, and it was FANTASTIC.  Already had a request to eat it again next week.  One of the reviewers on here said it was a horrible thing to put frozen meat in a crockpot.  I do it in other recipes and everything turns out great! 

***addendum 2015  I still make this all the time.  Today I made it without adding the brown sugar and it's still just as good!  This might be helpful for people watching carbs.

I'm very thankful for this recipe because it's become a favorite in my house for about a year. And is currently in my crock pot now :). Overtime I've made a few additions: Hot Sauce to taste, garlic powder, a chopped onion, and a chopped bell pepper. This recipe is really impossible to mess up. My husband loves when I suggest making this sometime in the upcoming week because it means he gets to pick whatever BBQ sauce he wants to try with it next. We usually end up going with a sweet & spicy. Make this for company and there will be no leftovers!

This had a wonderful taste.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and Kraft calorie-wise Italian dressing.

However, I also used bone-in chicken as it's all I had in my freezer (I did thaw before cooking, as well).  I can't stress how important it is to use boneless!!  Otherwise you'll be picking out shards of bone and accidentally swallow a few--this REALLY takes away from the taste.

Exactly what I was looking for.  I used Big Al's K.C. Bar-B-Q Sauce (look it up if you don't have a good sauce, you'll thank me) for the first time too so I'm not sure which was better.  The meat was very tender and moist, yummy.  Loved the suggestion by a reviewer to use the olive oil & garlic salt on the bread, even more yummy.  My husband thanks all contributors profusely.

Tried is like 5 times & always ended up w/ watery diluted sauce. I now make homemade bbq sauce called "a very popular bbq sauce" from this site.   The results are so much better and the flavor is way better too.  Finally ended up with shredded chicken in a thick rich sauce.  Yum!!!!

Loved it! Used chicken thighs as it was all I had and used Sweet Baby Rays BBQ. Shredded the chicken an hour before it was done and it turned out fantastic.

I made this following the recipe and it was amazing.  I cooked 4 chickens and it was devoured by three people.  I also added some poultry seasoning and italian seasoning after I shredding the chicken.  It was great.  My wife who doesn't usually like shredded chicken, loved it and is taking leftovers for lunch.  I will continue to make this for parties, dinners, and my family.

This is such an easy and fantastic recipe that most people will find delicious! It is certainly true that the better the bbq sauce, the better the end result. I followed this recipe exactly with only a few minor changes to suit my taste. I used Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce, the thick Worcestershire sauce, and Neumann's Own Italian dressing. After about 2 hours I added half of a chopped onion, and after three hours on high I shredded the chicken. Putting it in toasted hoagie rolls with shredded cheddar cheese made this a huge hit!

I followed the advice of others adding some onion, green pepper, chicken broth, salt and pepper along with the recipe's ingredients. An hour before it's finished cooking, shred the chicken with a fork (going with the grain) and pop back in slow cooker. I served  mine with ciabatta rolls and some veggies. Yummy!!

I made this today and thought that it was very good.  I used 3 frozen chicken breast halves, 1/2 of a 12 oz. bottle of barbeque sauce, 1/2 cup of Italian salad dressing, 1/2 cup of brown sugar, 2 Tbsp of Worcestershire sauce.  I cooked it in the crockpot on high for 5 hours, removed the chicken and cut it up in bite size pieces and returned it to the crockpot for 1 more hour.  I served it on buttered/toasted whole wheat hamburger buns.  Delicious- Even my first grader cleaned her plate!

Probably one of the easiest recipes out there (aside from just dumping a bottle of BBQ sauce in with the chicken) for a quick prep... I enjoyed the tang of the salad dressing. I think I'd skip the sugar next time, as the BBQ sauce has enough sweetness...

**UPDATE**I had about 2+ cups leftover so I froze it. Later I defrosted and topped a pizza crust with a little extra BBQ sauce, the chicken, and some cheddar jack cheese. It was AMAZING! ***Just made this using 3 large fresh chicken breasts, Jack Danieles BBQ, and lite wishbone italian. I cut them in half for more even cooking and easier shredding. 3 hours later, on low, the chicken was ready to shred but the sauce looked thin. I removed the chicken from the sauce and shredded it. Placed it back into the sauce and cooked on high for another 30 mins without the top on. It thickened the sauce a bit and allowed the chicken to absorb a bit more sauce.  

OVERALL, it was VERY easy and taste great. Would be even better on a pizza.

I didn't have any Italian salad dressing, so I made it without and wasn't disappointed! I also added a little extra brown sugar. Used Jack Daniel's BBQ sauce, mainly because it is a personal favorite.

I followed the recipe as written. I agree that bbq sauce does matter. I like sweet ray's or famous dave's brand. Some reviewers found that it was watery but I think they used the wrong bbq sauce. You need thick sauce not vinegar based sauce. Thanks for the recipe!

I personally didn't love the Italian dressing.  I've made variations of this before, with just BBQ sauce, green peppers and onions and it tastes much better.

Man, this was good and easy! I only used 3 chicken breast and I threw them in the slow cooker frozen before I turned the slow cooker. It smelled and tasted wonderful! I made sandwiches first, then the next day I made wraps using flour tortilla, the chicken and adding chopped cilantro, monteray jack cheese, and tabasico. Just warmed it up, crisped it up, in a pan on my stove. Made YUMMY wraps! Thanks for the recipe!

Love it!  I've made this recipe many times now and we still love it!  I always use Diana Sauce when I make this.  I've tried the original, chicken & rib, and the honey garlic bbq sauce with excellent results every time.

Great recipe.  I shredded the chicken about half way through cooking and let the sauce cook further into the meat that way.  Family and friends loved it.

Awesome flavor and SUPER easy!!!  I used Head Country BBQ sauce and it was fantastic.  Hubby ate 2 sandwiches and he hardly ever gets seconds (trying to not over eat), and was saying how good it was the whole time!!!  Thanks so much!

Absolutely loved it!  Took another reviewers notes and cooked chicken with garlic powder, chicken broth and s&p in slow cooker all day while at work.  Then put sauce mix and let sit for an hour.  IT WAS GREAT!

So super easy and very tasty.  Used Sweet Baby Ray's sauce and since I didn't have Worcestershire sauce on hand, used Lemon Juice.  Worked well.  Also had to add a little bit of water (~1/2 c) b/c my slow cooker runs hot & the sauce was getting a little thick.  Shredded the chicken about an hour before eating and it soaked up all the great flavor!   Will make again!  Would also be great for a crowd!

Quick and easy - yum! I served it on buns. And froze some, which I later mixed with a can of black beans and served over rice. Definitely use good bbq sauce though - poor quality sauce would kill this recipe.

I thought this was a fabulous recipe! I had two reservations initally: The first was the frozen chicken suggestion. In my experience, when using frozen breasts they normally turn out very tough. This wasn't the case w/this recipe-I cooked on high for approx 3 hours, then shredded the breasts and kept the slow cooker on the "warm" setting to allow the breasts time to soak up the sauce. The chicken was super tender using this method. The 2nd reservation was the italian dressing-it didn't seem to "go" w/the other ingredients. Because of this, i lowered the amt to 1/3 of a cup instead of 1/2. It was great! the tang of the dressing really complimented the bbq sauce. I will be using this recipe often-thanks for sharing it!

So good, so easy.  My barbeque sauce is a little on the sweet side, so I decreased the amount of brown sugar.  Thank you for the tasty recipe!

I LOVED THIS!  It was so easy, I think we'll be eating this often.  I cooked the chicken in chicken broth with sliced onions for about 4 hours, drained it, shredded it and added the sauce and dressing and let it cook for 2 more hours.  Thanks for such an easy, delicious recipe!

This is as good (if not better) than my favorite BBQ restaurant shredded chicken. Took another reviewer's advice and slow-cooked in chicken broth for 4 hours, then drained and added all sauce ingredients (after shredding) and turned out perfect. Thanks for the recipe!

This was really good.  I used Jack Daniel's BBQ sauce.  I took other's suggestion and added a med. onion and garlic.  Saute onion and garlic.  It was a little sweet.  Next time I will cut the sugar in half and add a little red pepper.  I also cooked for 3 hours on high.  Shredded, the chicken and put it back in the crock pot for another hour or so.  Might try cooking it on low if it is a work day.  I usually don't like chicken in the crockpot, but this was very good.  Update:  I made it again and cut the sugar.  I used about 3 tbs.  Much better.  I also added 6 slices of cooked bacon (cooked them first, then sauted the garlic and onion in some of the bacon fat) and added about 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes.  Everyone loved it.  Another update:  I tried it today with pork loin (that is what was on sale, I will try pork butt next time).  I followed the recipe exactly this time, but added a little garlic and onion powder to the meat before putting it in the crockpot.  It was really good.  Served it with hush puppies, coleslaw, and cinnamon apples.  Yum!

This was okay. The boneless breasts don't have enough fat so it was just kind of like dry shredded chicken in an overly sweet sauce. I used Sweet Baby Rays barbecue sauce. Maybe less-sweet sauce would be better, along with bone-in chicken pieces or even a whole chicken. You can remove the bones and skin before shredding it. Just a thought...

I followed this recipe exactly and have no idea what went wrong!  My sauce was very thin it never thickened or would stick to the chicken.  Not sure if I will try this again.

EASY and REALLY GOOD. Will enjoy trying it with an even better barbecue sauce. I used Bulls Eye with Guinness. It was excellent!!! Super easy to throw together. Update: It was really good the first day, not so much the second. Leftovers the next day didn't taste nearly as good. Gets a star knocked off for that.

Good recipe. Using the advice of others, I cooked the frozen breasts in chicken broth in the crock pot on high for about 3 hours. They shredded nicely - then drained the broth, added the BBQ sauce mixture and cooked on low for 2 hours. Very good -- use a BBQ sauce you like!!! I served on toasted buns, topped with parmesan cheese and served cole slaw on the side! Will make again using Rudy's Sause! A keeper!

I actually used a whole cut up chicken and increased the required measurements a bit and this was a HUGE hit with my family!  The chicken fell off the bone and was very flavorful.  I will definitely be using this one again.

I prepared this last night and it was awesome. My family ranted and raved about this meal. I stuck with the original recipe but defrosted my chicken before I put them in the crockpot(because I forgot to start it at noon). I cooked them for 3 hours on high and the meat was soooo moist. Not dry at all.I then took the meat out and shredded it and then returned it to the crockpot with the BBQ sauce. I had some dinner rolls from costco that we used for the sandwiches. For those who where having problems with the meat being dry, you may want to check doneness about an hour before. Cooking time really depends on how thick your meat is. As my son said last night "this dinner is a do over". Other words we will be having this again. ENJOY!!!

When I made this dish the chicken turned out really dry. I cooked it about 7 hours since the recipe said you could cook it 6-8 hours on low. Also, the barbeque sauce tasted burnt and not much like barbeque sauce at all; perhaps because the chicken was overcooked. Needless to say, I would not prepare this recipe again.

Zesty-licious!!  This was soooo good!  I only used 2 chicken breasts, but made a half recipe of sauce.  Before I shredded the chicken, it looked too saucy, but it was perfect after I shredded the chicken.  I served this over mashed potatoes.  I wish we had extra to eat as a sandwich tomorrow.  Oh well, next time I'll know to make a full recipe!  Thanks for the delightful recipe!

Edit 08/07/2017 - The kid I was pregnant with when I came up with this recipe is 13 now. I'm so happy it's a tried-and-true for so many. I am now a HUGE fan of the Instant Pot, and if you'd like to make this in there, here's the info: 
1) 1 cup water or broth in the bottom of the pot
2) Dump your frozen chicken breasts on top
3) I used Poultry setting for 15 minutes, 10 min NPR because I forgot about it.
4) Mix sauce in a bowl while cooking.
5) Pour off the broth (save for later cooking - I used mine for IP mac and cheese the next day), shred chicken, pour sauce over, and set IP to saute for about 10 min to heat through.

Worked GREAT!

-Suzanne

Glad to see so many people like this! I use the sauce combo frequently now. A note to people who said it was runny - that may have to do with the italian dressing you're using. I always use a thicker dressing. Some of the oily dressings might cause the sauce to thin out. My favorite is Kraft Light done Right! Italian dressing.

This is 5 stars IF you shred the chicken into the sauce when it is done cooking. Otherwise, the sauce does seem a bit thin. I only had 1 tbsp. of worcestershire sauce left, but I think it was still fine. Smells delicious. We ate the shredded chicken over mashed potatoes. Can't get any easier than this.

Ridiculously yummy! I added half an onion and 3 garlic cloves to 3 chicken breasts. Perfection. My husband went crazy! I put it on hoagies with slices of pickles and fresh, sharp cheddar cheese! Will be having this in my belly again in the future!!! :-}

Nicr easy dinner. I wasn't too jazzed with the recipe as is so I added more BBQ sauce when assembling. Next time, I'll use the whole packet of Italian salad dressing without the vinegar and oil.

This is a good, simple, family-friendly shredded bbq chicken recipe!  Made it last night and will definitely make it again.  My husband loved it!  I was leery to use frozen breasts in the crockpot (although many people seems to do fine with it...)so I defrosted and cleaned/trimmed the breasts first.  (I used 6 smaller boneless breasts).  I used the ingredients as listed and cooked on high for 3 hrs, and removed and shredded, and then return to cook on high for another hour.  The consistency of the sauce was perfect!  If I hadn't shredded the chicken I think it would have been watery as the chicken would have had trouble absorbing the liquid.  The addition of brown sugar makes it sweet, so if you use a sweeter bbq sauce, you may want to cut back.  I served on crusty rolls with a salad.  There were no leftovers.

Made this last night in the slow cooker.  Only left out the brown sugar...didnt have any and I didnt want it to be too sweet. I shredded the chicken after 3 hours...let it absorb the juice...also towards the end, I took off the crockpot lid and it really boiled down nicely.  It tasted great!  I served it on buns, topped with red onion, a sprinkle of cheddar cheese shreds, and a dollop of BBQ sauce...yum!  Fiance approved!  I made him 2 sandwiches, went back to make mine, sat down and one of his sandwiches was gone! i guess he liked it : )  Will definitely make again...and looking forward to leftovers tonight!

The sauce tasted great! With that said, it came out watery. 

It was my first time making it. Preparation was super easy. I used frozen breasts and think that is where I went wrong. I cooked on low for 8hrs with the sauce already in the pot from the beginning. The water from the frozen breasts mixed with the sauce ruining the consistency.

Next time I will just cook the breasts in the pot with chicken broth.  Then drain water, shred chicken, and add bbq sauce and cook for another hour or so.

Very good.  I used already defrosted chicken breasts.  Would not use frozen meat in the slow cooker.  It would cause the food to stay in the "danger zone" temperature too long!  Definitely use a good quality bbq sauce.  Also, definitely shred the chicken 30-60 minutes before the end of the cooking cycle.  The chicken soaks up the sauce and it creates the texture of shredded bbq chicken.  Thickens it up too.

I have not tried this recipe, but I have some questions.  (I'm new to cooking).  1. I leave work at 7:30 am and don't return until 5:15pm.  How can I cook this with an 8 hour time frame rather than 4?  2.  How do I defrost the chicken?  Can I just place it in the microwave?  How long?  Thank you.

This is a great tasting easy recipe. Don't let the BBQ/Italian dressing combo throw you off:-) Plus it is incredibly cheap to make if you can stock up on the dressing and BBQ sauce when they go on sale.

We loved this! I only had 3 chicken breasts so I adjusted the recipe and just eyeballed the measurements. There was a little too much liquid left after cooking on low for 8 hours so I shredded the chicken and continued cooking on high with the lid OFF for around 30 minutes. Leaving the lid off allows liquid to evaporate and the sauce thicken. I would do it this way again rather than use less BBQ sauce because the result was heavenly.  Also, my chicken wasn't frozen because I believe using frozen can be unsafe.

I made this the other day, and it was one of the best things that I have ever made, period. Chicken was so tender I was like WHAAATTT!?!? This chicken has no business being this good. I had leftovers of this stuff for like 3 days and I was packin' the most insane lunches ever, this recipe is for real yo. My moms was all like "What are you making?" and I was like "Don't worry about it, give me your slow cooker and leave me alone for 4 hours." Nahhh im just playin i love my moms still id never play her like that. This chicken is great stuff up in this piece, thanks for the recipe.

Very easy to make.  About two hours before it is done, I remove the chicken and shred it, and put it back in the crock pot with the sauce.  This seems to add more flavor and helps thicken the sauce.  Great recipe!!

I thought that this was pretty good!  I used fresh chicken breasts and cooked on high for about two hours.  I noted that the sauce seemed a bit thin, so I added two heaping tablespoons of cornstarch.  I also shredded as much of the chicken as was cooked, then lowered the cooking temp to "low" for another hour.  I then shredded the rest of the chicken, and served!  Four of the six kids who ate it loved it and asked for seconds.  The other two are notoriously picky, so they are really not good judges anyway. :)

I did not rate it a 5 stars because the time is off. It does not need to cook as long as it says. However, the flavor is great.

My family loves the recipe! I did make a few changes though... I seasoned the breasts with a southwest chipotle rub along with some salt and pepper. In addition to this I added minced garlic into the sauce, used a little less brown sugar and used sweet baby rays bbq sauce. Using sweet baby rays mine did not come out watery at all. I also added shredded cheddar to garnish with some sliced red onion on a fresh toasted garlic bun! AMAZING!!!

I made this exactly as the recipe stated, except used a whole bag (2 lbs?) of frozen chicken breasts which equalled about 8 breasts.  I used the Serving Calculator on the site to alter the ingredient amounts.  I love that feature!  I defrosted the chicken first, then added the chicken and sauce in my crockpot and refrigerated it over night.  I cooked it on high for 4 hours, then removed the chicken and all the sauce into a separate bowl.  After shredding the chicken, I added it back to the crock pot with about half the sauce and cooked it on low for another 2 hours.  The remaining sauce I served on the side for those who wanted more.  It was very easy and very tasty!

this was great—i'm relatively new to the slow cooker, but it's my favorite thing i've made so far. i used fresh chicken, cooked for 3 hours on high, took it out to shred, then back in for another hour. i did add about a TBSP of flour as, based on other reviews, i was nervous about the thickness, although i don't know that it needed it. to get to five stars, next time i will either cut down on the brown sugar, but that's really just a matter of taste. i will definitely be making this again soon!

The flavor was great but the sauce was extremely watery, it made our buns soggy. I put the chicken on sweet Hawaiian buns, which was tasty. Cooked my raw chicken on high 3 hours and it was done.

This was a great recipe, I followed the recipe exactly. I do believe in using the good quality sauces as I am sure this really made the difference.  I will be making this recipe again at the end of the month for a work's pot-luck.  Just know he guys will love it.  Thank you for sharing.

This was an amazing recipe! I did not take the time to read the reviews before I made the BBQ chicken so I did throw the chicken in frozen. With that said before I shredded the chicken I drained about half of the juice then added about a half cup more of BBQ sauce. All said and done it did not have too much liquid and tasted AMAZING! I will try to make it next time with unfrozen chicken, but if you start the recipe before you read the reviews don't worry about what you've read... just drain it a bit before you throw the shredding chicken back in the mix. Also, I used KC Masterpiece so I think the thick style BBQ that it is helped out significantly.

This is a great recipe! I have made it over and over again, and it is a crowd pleaser! I use Corky's BBQ sauce. I serve it with tortilla chips and white cheese dip for very tasty BBQ nachos.

Per another reviewer: I season chicken with garlic powder, a little salt and pepper add a can of chicken broth and throw in crockpot and cook on low for about 6 to eight hours. When you get home, drain grease shred chicken and pour rest of ingredients (plus 1 tsp liquid smoke, 4 cloves of garlic minced and 1/2 a cup of minced onions) over chicken for about an hour to blend flavors.

Awesome.  Have made several times.  Once, I used mango barbeque sauce and served on hawaiian bread, and made bbq chicken sliders.  Definitely a keeper.

This is very good and easy to make.  I don't have a crock pot so I cooked everything on my stove top in a pot.  I used my favorite BBQ sauce(Sweet Baby Ray's) which is sweet, therefore I didn't add any brown sugar.  My husband and 21 year old son really enjoyed this dish.  I'll definitely make this again, for a fast meal.

Yum!  Only add sugar if you like it extra sweet.  The sauce is thin but you don't really need much sauce as the chicken takes on all the delicious bbq flavor.  I added minced onion and a litte pepper.

This was fantastic!
I used frozen bone-in (by mistake!) chicken breasts.I took the suggestion to salt, pepper, & garlic them them put them in chicken broth in the crockpot on low for 6 hours.  The chicken just fell apart, didn't take much to shred. Then I put the shredded chicken back in the crock with all the other ingredients for an hour. The whole family LOVED it!  Was great served on Hawaiian bread rolls.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe, and it was incredibly easy to throw together!  I think it may have been even better with a little chopped onion or garlic in the sauce, but that's just our taste.  I'll definitely keep this on hand for when I'm super busy!

YUM!  Followed the recipe to a T except:  Add 1/2 chopped onion and 1 clove minced garlic.  Used a 19oz bottle of Jack Daniels BBQ Sauce.  Cooked for about 4 hours on high and then shredded chicken.  Was a bit thin so I left cover off and after an hour the chicken sopped up all the sauce and it was PERFECT!  Served on fresh Ciabatta rolls with sliced red onion and sweet pickle chips and some redskin potato salad on the side.  SO GOOD!  Everyone loved and this was too easy to yield food THAT tasty!  YUM YUM YUM!

I didn't have Italian dressing so I added ketchup, brown sugar, Worchestershire sauce and mustard along with some spices. Cooked it for about 5 hours or so and served on hoggie rolls with potato salad. It turned out fabulously and everyone loved it.

This is a very easy and yummy recipe!!  Although, it really all depends on the BBQ sauce you use.  My chicken was a little sweeter then I would have liked it, so next time I will probably get a spicy BBQ sauce.  But I love throwing everything in the crock-pot for a delicious dinner, SO EASY!!  I did put some flour in towards the end of cooking the chicken because my sauce was very thin, I wanted it to be thick.  But still turned out great!  I just put the chicken on toasted hamburger buns and my hubby loved it!

I have a lot of shredded chicken left over, which is great!!  I plan on making a BBQ Chicken Pizza with the leftovers tonight, YUM!!

Great recipe if you want a healthier version of pulled pork sandwiches!!

My husband could not stop raving about this dinner!  As soon as he walked in the house after work he kept saying how delicious it smelled. I used Sweet Baby Rays honey barbecue sauce and I also added liquid smoke, chopped onion, cayenne pepper and garlic cloves as other readers did.  I only used 3 chicken breasts and my sauce was not runny at all.  In fact it was really thick. I do not know if it was the barbecue sauce but, it was fantastic!  I used Belles hamburger bun recipe and this was a great hit.  Will definitely continue using this all the time.  Thank you for the great recipe!

This is very good. Just throw some chicken in the crockput with enough water to cover it and cook on medium for a few hours. When it's somewhat cooked, shred or cube the chicken and put it back in the crockpot with all the sauce for a few more hours. I highly recommend using Sweet Baby Ray's sauce and eliminating the sugar as there is plenty in most sauces already. I also put in about 2 teaspoons garlic powder and 1 tablespoon crushed red pepper to enhance the flavor but you should only do so if you like things spicier. I prefer Bragg's Amino Acid to the Worcestershire sauce but it's fine either way. This great served on potato buns with some scalloped potatoes on the side.

This was pretty good, and easy. An obviously healthier alternative to pulled pork. But I did find that just the chicken on a sandwich was rather boring- it sort of needs to be spiced up maybe with a slice of cheese or cole slaw- or lettuce and tomato.
Very easy and waiting when you get home after a long day, so I'll definately keep the recipe for when I'm in a time crunch. Thanks!

Yummy! I followed the recipe exactly. The BBQ sauce- Italizn Salad Dressing combo sounded wierd to me but it tasted great. I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce. I also used fresh chicken breasts instead of frozen, cooked on low for 3 hours, then shredded the chicken and continued cooking on low another hour or so. Easy as pie! Thanks for sharing. This one's a keeper.

Super recipe!  It's completely (cooking) cheating at its best.  The prep time, the flavors, energy savings (with a slow cooker) and the convenience make me absolutely love this recipe.

wow! great, super easy recipe! if there was a world record for pickiest eater, my dad would hold it.  He LOVED this!!! It looked too simple to be good, but it is soo good!  The frozen chicken worked great, subbed soy sauce for the worcestershire, which worked fine.  Dump and go! thicken the sauce a bit with flour after shredding and adding back the chicken if u like. this is now a staple dish in my house!

I have been asked again and again for this recipe! So fast, easy, and delicious! I disagree with the serving count. I halve this recipe for our little family of three, and still end up with quite a bit of leftovers. Excellent as written, but after making several times, I now sub in lite Italian dressing, Splenda brown sugar blend, and Lea & Perrins Chicken "Marinade" in place of the Worcestershire. And I always use Baby Ray's BBQ sauce for the best flavor. AWESOME!!

We had this last night for supper.  Didn't change a thing.  It cooked on low for about 7 hours in the crock pot.  The chicken was so tender that I pulled it apart and let it soak up the juice while I prepared the rest of the meal.  I got some really fresh bakery buns and toasted with olive oil.  Thanks for the recipe!

Cooked rather fast was a bit to sweet for my taste.  I think I will use a different bbq base or cut the sugar out next time.

Delicious.  Followed the recipe exactly. Cooked on low for 5 hours, then shredded chicken and returned to crockpot and cooked on low for another hour.

This recipe is fast, easy and full of flavor. I use Jack Daniel's Original Barbq Sauce, and Paul Newmans Italian Salad dressing. Very moist, delicious chicken! I would shred the chicken and let it sit in the juices for another 30 minutes in crockpot, really lets the flavors get into the chicken. Def making this again for our family!

Will definitely make again!  After about 5 hours on high, I took the chicken out of the sauce and shredded it and then threw it back in.  Very Good and a huge hit with the family.

AMAZING!  Best chicken barbecue ever.  Use a great bbq sauce though.  We used Sweet baby rays.  Put the leftovers over roasted potatoes...delish.

I loved this recipe. So easy and so tasty! I cooked the chicken with chopped onion, minced garlic, and some chicken broth for about 6 hours. Once the chicken was cooked thru and falling apart I dumped the broth/onion/garlic, turned off the slow cooker and added the bbq (orig. jack daniels), dressing, sugar, and worcestershire. Let this combine for about 2 to 2.5 hours. Made baked beans on the side and served on hoagie rolls. Very good!

So easy and delicious!  Pulling the chicken definitely helps with soaking up the sauce.  Molasses vs. vinegar based barbeque sauce also seems to make a big difference, as another reviewer mentioned.

The BEST!!!  It was a tad on the sweet side. Next time I'll reduce the sugar. As other reviewers have noted, it is essential to the recipe to use a high quality barbecue sauce (or even make your own, if you want).

This is sooooo delicious.  Best served over a baked potato and topped with some cheddar cheese and/or sour cream.  Or, you can serve it in a sandwich roll.  Don't be afraid to just put the frozen chicken breasts in the crockpot and let them cook.  You don't need to thaw them out ahead of time.  Its super easy to make and foolproof!

Family of 6 ALL loved this recipe (for once)! A few of my family members are real "foodies" and only like "gourmet" ... but they all raved about this. Definitely will be a regular as it is super easy on a busy workday. I used 5 frozen breasts and cooked on low most of the day (7-8 hours) then shredded and cooked another hour or so longer. Served on buns and my boys thought it was a "sloppy joe".

I am no chef, but this recipe was easy to follow and turned out great! My boyfriend thought it was delicious. I used 2 unfrozen chk breasts and cut the ingredients accordingly, and added onion and garlic, and put it on high for 3 hrs, shredded the chicken and then low for 2 hours.

DELICIOUS!  I made this with fresh chicken breasts (not frozen), and sliced the breasts before cooking.  I realized too late, that I was out of Worcestershire sauce (shucks!), so threw in a couple Tbsp of spicy brown mustard, and it was awesome!  Cooked on High for 1.5 hours, then Low for another 3.5 hrs.  Made sandwiches with just a little bit of mayo on some fluffy rolls.  Everyone in my picky family gobbled it up.  Thanks!

Very good!  I did some things different. I defrosed my chicken first and added 4 cloves minced garlic and 1/2 a chopped onion. Cooked on low for about 4 hours then shredded chicken and put it back in for a hour. Came out great! Use brown sugar also and added red pepper. My husband ate it on a hoggie and I had mine in a backed potato. Tomorrow for lunch I will be putting it in a southwest salad. I love how many different things you can do with this recipe. Also I thought there was too much sauce in it and that is why I shredded it and put it back in but it covered it completly. Amazing!

We used 4 pounds of fresh chicken breasts, cooked for about 6 hours on low, breaking up the chicken a bit after about 3 hours, and it was perfect!  We used Jack Daniels BBQ sauce and ciabatta rolls (the density of the bread is perfect for soaking up the juices without becoming too soggy... the kaiser rolls got way too soggy in comparison.)

I love this recipe. It's in our regular rotation. I follow the recipe exactly, except that I put it in the slow cooker for 6-7 hours, then shred the chicken, stir it, and then let it sit for another hour or two. This helps thicken the sauce and makes the chicken really really tender.

This was very good. I will use the recipe for the sauce often. I had to give it four stars because my chicken was done cooking after 4 hours on low.  All crockpots cook differently but 6 hours on low and my chicken would have been unedible. I used a light balsamic vinegarrette and it was wonderful.  Great easy recipe!!!!!

I followed all ingredients and would not change a thing! This recipe was great as written. I did notice the sauce was a little watery before shredding the chicken but after it thickened right up! Will use this again and again, was a huge hit in my house..thanks!

This is such an easy recipe to do and still very tasty!  I had lots of frozen chicken and not a lot of other ingredients, so I needed something good with a short ingredients list.  I had Sweet Baby Rays bbq sauce and a zesty Italian dressing.  An hour before eating I shredded the chicken and added a splash of liquid smoke I had on hand.  DELICIOUS!!!

My husband has requested that I make this recipe at least once a month, which is fine by me since it is so easy to make!  I usually make it with chicken tenders and serve it with vegetables to avoid having to shred the meat.  So simple!

I am always hesitant trying new things because my family does not like to try new things, but this was wonderful and everyone loved it. I didn't have worcestershire sauce so I didn't add it. I cooked the chicken on high for about 2-3 hours and was concerned because the sauce was so runny. But when I turned the crockpot down to low, the sauce did thicken up some. I pulled the chicken apart and let it sit for about 1 hour on keep warm. The chicken was so moist.  It was not dry liked pork can be. Great balance of flavors. I had minimal leftovers but fed 8 people and my husband had 3 sandwiches. A great change for chicken.

Threw this in the crock pot at 11:30 a.m., stirred it once at 2:30 and we were sitting down to eat at 5:30 with compliments, upon compliments all around. Everyone loved it. Followed the recipe with no alterations and ended up with very flavorful, moist chicken. We will do this one again! Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was pretty good and I'm not even a big fan of bbq sauce.  I basically cut in half the amount of bbq sauce, salad dressing, brown sugar and worcestershire sauce while using about 3 lbs of chicken breast and it was still plenty of sauce.  Overall, a good and easy recipe.

I didn't have any Italian salad dressing on hand so I just threw in the rest of the ingredients.  The chicken was tender and very good.  If you want to throw something together that is extremely simple, try this recipe.  With the upcoming football season, this will surely be a huge hit with any crowd that you have over at your house.

tasty, but i dont like my bbq to be nearly as sweet as this turned out, so i used half the sugar the second time. Turned out nice with Famous Dave's bbq sauce and with Jack Daniel's sauce, though it was more moist with Jack Daniel's. I put this on toasted keiser rolls from the grocery store bakery, and it when well with a vinegary slaw on the side.

I used 8 boneless skinless thighs, turned out well. I would like it a little less saucy myself but still good.

Scrumptious BBQ chicken sandwiches and SOOOO simple! I made a double portion to take to a pot luck and served with mini buns... they were absolutely delicious! I cooked mine on low for at least 8 hrs. Took the chicken out a couple of hrs. before it was done to shred it and then added it back to the crockpot for the last 2 hrs. of cook time. It does seem like too much liquid at first, but once the chicken is shredded, it soaks up and absorbs the juices nicely and has the perfect consistency to sit on a bun. I used "Good Seasons" Italian dressing and for the BBQ Sauce, "Open Pit" - original flavor, (because of the addition of the brown sugar, I didn't want to go with a sweet tasting sauce). These brands turned out great results, but use whatever your personal favorites are.

Brought this over to a friends after letting it cook all day, the parents and children all devoured this.  They have been asking for the recipe ever since. I took the advice of a couple other people and shredded the chicken and then added it back to the crock pot for another hour.  There were no leftovers this time around, however next time I will definitely plan on making a BBQ Chicken pizza with the leftovers.

This was really very good. The only thing I would change is I would add some chili powder next time. It was a bit on the sweet side for my taste. I like my BBQ chicken to have some kick to it.

Our family loves this recipe. I usually follow the directions to a "T" (but use fresh chicken breasts instead of frozen).  The last time I made these, I cooked the chicken first in the crockpot by it self (with some stock) for about 2 hours, shredded it, then added the rest of the ingredients and cooked again for an hour so the flavors had a chance to meld. I liked this way better because the barbecue sauce was more "fresh" tasting. Sometimes my slowcooker gives a faint "burned" taste to the bbq sauce if cooked the entire time and I'm not a big fan of that. Anyways, fabulous blend of flavors.

It can't possibly get much easier than this to throw something together for dinner!  I did not find that the dressing altered the flavor of the sauce much so definitely use a flavor you like (ie, sweet, smokey, tangy, etc.) because that is what you'll get.

This recipe was so unbelievably easy I didn't think it could possibly turn out...I was wrong!  My family thought the chicken was so tender and flavorful that this recipe now trumps my barbecued pulled pork!  I followed the recipe exactly as written (using either Sweet Baby Rays, Jack Daniels, or Sticky Fingers sauce) but also threw in some chopped sweet onions.  After I shredded the chicken, I ladled some of the juices over it; then took a ladleful of the cooking juices and mixed it with some more of the bottled barbecue sauce to make a thicker sauce for serving.  We used the chicken in flour tortilla wraps with lettuce and some shredded cheddar.  Delicious - thanks for the recipe!

Very good!  Although 6 hours on low ended up being a bit too long for my chicken.  It got a tad try but the sauce made up for that.  I also added some cornstarch mixed with water towards the end since the sauce was very runny.   Thanks for the recipe!

I made this according to the recipe but I made the mistake of using thawed chicken instead of frozen so it got a bit dry using the recommended cooking time.  This is not a mistake I will make again  ;)   I used Sweet Baby Ray's for the BBQ and the sauce came out amazing!  I will definitely make this again :)

5 stars for ease of preparation and great flavor!  The shredding was so easy--I hadn't done this before and thought that part would be tricky, but it shredded apart effortlessly and I had it back in the crockpot in less than a minute!

I think it called for the chicken to be in there for too long. My chicken came out with a brown coating all around and it tasted burnt. I followed the directions, which I always do the first time. Well, atleast hubby ate it on sandwiches for work. If I tried this again, I would cook it for less time and put the chicken in there raw. TRY pulling apart frozen chicken and cleaning it too.

I love the idea of this recipe, just plopping something in the slow cooker and letting it cook all day...However in this case when I got home to check on it I found that the BBQ sauce had formed a burnt ring around the edges that sadly permeated the whole dish. Also, as other reviewers have mentioned make sure you use a BBQ sauce you really like otherwise you're wasting your time. Neither of these things are the recipe's fault though and to its credit even burnt taste and BBQ sauce pickyness aside I would probably try this again when I can keep half an eye on it and I find a sauce I'm in love with.

This is easy, but it tastes a bit strange. I think it may have been the Italian dressing. The chicken was dry and the sauce was watery. It was edible but no one really seemed to be in love with the dish.

My husband eats four or five barbecue chicken sandwiches when I make this recipe using Big Al's K.C. Bar-B-Q Sauce from this site.  Thanks for a great recipe!  (Oh, and definitely use a slow cooker liner or you'll be chiseling barbecue chicken from the insides of your crock pot for a week.)

Although the combination of ingredients seems strange, this is the best chicken.  It is so easy to make and the flavors come together so well.  Everyone looks forward to it and even enjoys it the next day as leftovers.  Try it, you won't be sorry!

This is a good starter! I didn't have italian dressing so I combined two BBQ sauces - Sweet Baby Ray's regular and Carolina Treet (I AM in NC and love the vinegar - mustardy style sauce). That gave it the right tang. Also added onion and garlic and red pepper flakes per some reviews. I had boneless skinless chicken thighs and cooked them from fresh, not frozen. It didn't take any time at all, maybe an hour and a half at a low boil (mediumish) on the stove, then shredded the thighs and stewed for another hour. Fantastic! Just the right amount of hot and sweet, very tender, not too liquidy at all. Shredding the chicken really does soak up the sauce - also using thicker sauces helps. Just FYI, dark meat chicken actually makes good stewed/BBQ style dishes and doesn't dry out as quickly as chicken breasts sometimes do. Thanks!

Superb!  So easy and the chicken is so flavorful and tender.  I did add some sliced onion and used Dinosaur BBQ Sensuous Slathering Sauce.  The perfect combination.

This is a great and very quick to prepare recipe.  I used boneless pork chops instead of chicken and added a sliced white onion on top. I skipped the brown sugar as the BBQ sauce I used was quite sweet and I used an Italian dressing made with balsamic vinegar which is also sweet. Will definitely make again - Mmmmmmmm!

OMG! This was so delicious according to my son and the others who ate it.  I did not get to try it (juice fasting), but will make it when I am able to try it.  I did it with frozen chicken legs and thighs and it came out soooooo tender.  Some ate it with bread and some put it over jasmine rice.  I will definitely be making this regularly!  Thank you!

Very good.  I used Kraft Tuscan House Italian dressing and Sweet Baby Ray's Hot'N Spicy barbecue sauce.  Made just enough sauce once the chicken was shredded.

Delicious!
I did NOT use frozen chicken, and I used skinless chicken breasts WITH the bone.  I find that cooking them on the bone makes them much juicier.  
I sliced one large sweet yellow onion, and put this over the bottom of the slow cooker.  I laid the bone-in chicken breasts on top of the onions, and seasoned all well with kosher salt and lemon pepper.  Also sprinkled a couple of cloves of minced garlic over the chicken.  Ended up using an 18 oz. bottle of bbq sauce, used recipe amounts of dressing, worcestershire, and br sugar, and also added a little apple cider vinegar to the sauce.
Cooked on low for about 5 hours, and then pulled chicken off the bone (it literally all just fell apart), and shredded the meat into the sauce.  Served the meat right out of the cooker, piled up on toasted whole wheat buns with melted cheddar/chipotle cheese.
YUM!

Oh my gosh!!!  I just found this recipe this morning and immediately put it in the crock pot for dinner tonight.  It was sooooooooooo yummy!!!  My hubby wants me to try it with pork and beef.  I followed the recipe but also added chopped onion, garlic and some liquid smoke.  This was better than the BBQ House that we go to.  I will definitely be adding this to the rotation.  For those that said that it was too watery, it looked that way when the chicken was whole but I shredded it and put it back in the sauce and even added more BBQ sauce to it (by the way, I use Sweet Baby Ray's) and it was the perfect consistency.  I served the shredded chicken on toasted kaiser rolls and garlic flavored home fries.  It was delish!!!!

I thought this was just okay. I give it five stars because my family loved it. I served it on warm sandwich buns and they just devoured it all. I guess I'll be making this often.

although this was good, i dont know what it was about it i didnt like. I think it was the worsht. sauce.  I used honey hickory bbq sauce which made it yummy. I only added a little brown sugar since the bbq sauce i was using was sweet. I also added an onion.  Great though, thanks

This was ok.  I left it in the crockpot for a while and unfortunately the sauce took on the consistency of molasses.  **UPDATE** I made this a second time and it turned out much better.  I used an 18oz bottle of bbq sauce, 1/4C of water, and 1/2 of an Italian Dressing Packet.  It turned out really well.  We first ate it on hamburger buns.  For leftovers, we put it on baked potatoes with cheddar cheese.

This was WONDERFUL! I don't really have a slow cooker so I cooked it in my 'slow cooker substitute' pot on top of the stove. The chicken shredded easily on it's own with ocassional stirring and the sauce cooked off. Amazingly flavorful.  As we avoid corn syrup (which is in most commercial BBQ sauces and salad dressings) I used BBQ sauce from Trader Joes and homeade Italian dressing from the "Italian Dressing Mix" recipie I found on this site.

Followed the recipe exactly, except cut it in 1/2. Wish I hadn't so we would have had more for leftovers! Had it with sharp cheddar on soft rolls and it was perfect!  The whole family loved it and I am making a second batch right now for lunch tomorrow.  Don't need to change a thing.  This recipe is great! Think I will try it with ribs or make it into a pulled pork sometime, although we really liked it with the chicken.  I used Sweet Baby Rays Hickory BBQ sauce & it was great. 
Thanks for sharing.

This was Great!!! I used a whole cut-up chicken (removed the skins before putting in slow cooker) and Rendezvous Hot BBQ sauce (Memphis Style!). It cooked for 8 Hrs on low, then (since we weren't home yet) another 2 on warm. The chicken was slightly over done, but still wonderful! Shredded the chicken served it over Garlic Mashed Potatoes. Will definitely make this one again.

This was okay, the juices from the chicken keep the BBQ from sticking to the chicken and it also makes the BBQ sauce really runny.  I did thicken it up with con starch, but it still wasnt all that zesty.

I made this recipe a few weeks ago and making it again tonight. I have no hesitation that my boyfriend will be surely surprised when he gets home from work. The first time I made it he said it was just like the chicken his grandma used to make him as a kid. I did take into account the other users' tips, such as: THE SAUCE IS THE KEY! you HAVE to use a good sauce to make it work, I used Bulls Eye Chicken and Rib and also added a table spoon of honey in the mixtures. I used *thawed chicken breasts and placed them in the slowcooker all in the center, then poured my goopy mixture overtop. I left it for about 3 o 4 hours on high. it turned out so sweet and sticky. Also be sure to get good quality chicken (this is not meant how it sounds, but) the bigger the breast the better, I found, smaller ones in my slow cooker got a little rubbery on the edges. All in all a great recipe, if you follow it to a tee, this is really great chicken but I do have one tip to follow: doucle the mixture as the chicken will be completely coated and makes for really tender chicken, along with a leftover sauce to go over your rice, potatoes or other side dish.

This was delicious!!! Four hours into cooking I shredded the meat and threw it back in for about 1 1/2-2 hrs.  I took it camping (in the crock),brought a bag of finger rolls and heated it up over a fire.  It smelled great.  I made it a seperate time with pork chops the  same way and that too was incredible.

This was wonderful.  My my hubby and 3 children loved it.  I used the Italain Dressing Mix on this site and made the dressing from scratch.  I think the seasonings  and vinegar in the dressing gave this chicken an authenic southern bbq joint flavor.  What a great and easy dinner.  It is hard to please my picky eaters, but this did!

I love this recipe! I followed the much appreciated advice of another reviewer- I removed the chicken to shred after cooking for 5 hours on low, tossed it back in the crock pot with one chopped yellow onion then let it cook for another hour.  I served over rice. 
PERFECT!

Very good.  I used fresh chicken and cooked on high for 3 hours and it was delicious.  I also added a few cloves of garlic per another reviewer.  Very quick and easy which is just what this nursing student needs!

Easy and Excellent!  I used Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce during the cooking and I added a little more at the end.  I also took the chicken out of the crock pot and shredded it.  Then I put it back in for another 20 minutes.  The sauce thickened up.  Serve it on a Kaiser roll...very good recipe.

I loved this recipe.  It was easy and yummy.  I did have to add some onions, yellow peppers, and green peppers for personal taste.  Other than that it was great.  I will cook this one again.

I always follow a new recipe “as is” the first time I try and then add/omit ingredients if it’s a keeper. This is a keeper! Like other reviews, thought combo of dressing and bbq sauce was odd but it’s so good! I agree strongly with using nicer bbq sauce. It does make a difference in all recipes. 

I took advice from another review to cook chicken in broth then add sauce later to prevent burning. Perfect! Used three large chicken breast, seasoned with garlic powder, onion powder, + meat tenderizer. Added two cups of Swanson broth (cooked on Low for 4 hours) Pot auto sets to warm afterwards. It was perfect when returning home. (Six hours total) dumped the broth, shredded the chicken and added in the sauce. Set back to Low for 1 hour. No watery sauce here! Delicious!

This is a great recipe! Everyone in my family loved it too. I did add 2 teaspoons of liquid smoke and cut down the brown sugar to 2 tablespoons. Thank you for the suggestions! I didn't really taste the Zesty Italian but  the chicken still came out delicious! Thank you for sharing!

Yummy :) I made it for the first time today, delicious. My family loved it!!!!  I used freshed chicken breast. I sauteed onions and minced garlic in olive oil. Lightly seasoned my chicken.  I added a little chicken broth ,red crushed pepper along with the onions to my Crockpot. I cooked it on high for 3 hours, shredded the chicken which absorbed the liquid. I also added a little more barbecue sauce since I only used 6 ounces in the beginning. I cooked it for a hour more and it was gooooood. I used  Sweet Baby Ray's brown sugar barbecue sauce.

Delicious bbq sauce!  After shredding the chicken, I spread it on a foil lined jelly roll pan and put it under the broiler to carmelize the sauce.  The family loved it.  Thank you for the recipe.

This recipe is as good, as it is simple. I use Hunt's Hickory BBQ sauce, Ken's Italian dressing, the brown sugar, Lea & Perrin's Worcestershire sauce  and 4 large skinless,  boneless chicken breasts. I cook it on  high in the Crock Pot for 4 hours, and split the breast meat in the pot into "pulled" pieces. The chicken makes the best sandwiches and tacos, ever.

Simply Delicious and a Keeper!

This recipe was very good and I had no issues with the thickness of the sauce.  I did follow the advice of others and made some tweaks.  I used 6 boneless, skinless fresh chicken breast halves.  Seasoned them in the slow cooker with staple seasonings (Adobo, Garlic Powder, Onion Powder, White Pepper), chopped up in chunks and added red onion, green pepper, orange pepper, red pepper and Garlic cloves.  I then poured Chicken Broth into the pot until all items were covered.  Cooked on High for 3 hours.  Drained the liquid from the pot and removed vegetables.  Used two forks to shred the chicken then poured the ingredients as directed for the sauce into the pot.  Cooked for ½ hour more on high.

I used an 18oz bottle of Sweet Baby Ray’s Sweet Vidalia BBQ sauce and a little bit of Stick Fingers (don’t remember the type) along with Wishbone’s Italian Dressing.

I did need to add some more Adobo, white salt and Italian seasoning in the end to counter the sweetness of the sauce.  Maybe next time I won’t use a Sweet BBQ sauce along with the brown sugar.

Oh...and I added bacon strips on top of the sandwiches...delicious!!

I do one bag of frozen chicken breasts, one bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's, 3 hours on high, fork split and eat!  I've tried it with a little apple cider vinegar, not bad.  I do not recommend cooking chicken in the crock pot on low.

I made this two nights ago. I only tweaked it based on what I had on hand. I thawed 4 large frozen chicken breasts, placed them in the slow cooker. Added 1/2 cup of Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce, 1/2 c zesty Italian dressing, 1 cup of double strength chicken stock, 2 tbsp soy sauce and a tbsp brown sugar, 1/2 cup finely chopped onion and 1 clove minced garlic. Cooked 4 hours on high. Shredded and served in soft flour tortillas with grated cheddar etc. Even my picky 6 year old granddaughter wolfed them down! Enough for 2 nights! It was delicious. Thank you for sharing.

This was really tasty! Did everything basically the same way in the directions except I took someone's advice and thawed and cleaned the chicken beforehand. I added Italian seasoning to the chicke with some salt and pepper. I cooked for 4 hours on low, shredded it as much as I could because it wasn't that moist yet, and another two hours afterwards I

Amazing and so versatile that you can add (onions, or special sauce, extra sugar etc.) or omit things you don't want (like the Italian dressing which I didn't think this recipe needed).

So glad we discovered this and that I read the comments. I prepare a ton of chicken as mentioned in the first comment - garlic powder, paprika, and a little chicken broth or water on low for 6-8 hours. Then I shred it all and use it for everything (pizza, enchiladas, stuffed crescent rolls, salads, etc), and of course this recipe. I use sweet baby rays honey bbq and F&E Italian, I don't add brown sugar since the bbq is sweet. I mix that in the bottom of my warm crockpot then mix in shredded chicken until it's not too saucy. I let it warm up while I prepare the salad and rolls or buns. Very good with a slice of cheddar cheese.

This is great barbecue chicken!! I loved that I didn't have to slave in the kitchen. Very easy to make and it was really good. Just make sure you buy great barbecue sauce not the cheap stuff. I used boneless chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts. The thighs are much juicier and tender. Another tailgate winner!!

Yum! This is a very good recipe for chicken barbecue. I used four thawed, trimmed chicken breasts, Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory & Brown Sugar barbecue sauce, Kraft Italian dressing and a little less brown sugar than the recipe called for. I found that 5 1/2 to 6 hours on low was perfect. I'll definitely make this again; my husband also loved it.

I put 4 frozen chicken thighs and 2 frozen chicken breasts in the crock pot with some chicken broth and chopped onion with some salt, pepper and a heavy sprinkle of BBQ rub.  Cooked on low until I got home from work.  Strained the chicken/onion from the broth, pulled off the skin, deboned the thighs and shredded the chicken.  Back into the crock pot with onions and added the BBQ sauce mixture until it was warmed through.  Nice taste of BBQ in the winter - makes me long for the summer...

I love this recipe!  I've made this a bunch of times and it's perfect because I never remember to take chicken out of the freezer to defrost...  I like to use Sweet Baby Ray's sweet and spicey BBQ sauce, but I don't add brown sugar.  I'm not a fan of super sweet BBQ chicken.

This recipe was pretty amazing! I followed  the recipe with little additions we like garlic so I added a little in while cooking my husband and I like a little heat with our food so on our own sandwiches we but a bit of horseradish , shredding the chicken  at the end and letting it cook in the juice the last hour really helps with the "to juicy problem". Both of my children 12 and 2 ate and loved it..I didn't think my 2 year old was going to eat it but proved me wrong while eating a sandwich and a half! I plan on making this again give it a try soooooooo good!!!

This was delicious! The right BBQ sauce makes all the difference. Changed it up quite a bit but this recipe was the inspiration... Pressure cooked to save time. Also, followed a helpful reviewers idea of adding onion, black beans and corn. Yummy meal with fiber!

I only used 3 frozen chicken breasts but this was simply amazing! I even amazed my husband that I can cook!.... With a little help thanks to this app! Of course I reduced everything by half and I cooked on high for about 5 hours. But the smell of the sauce while cooking was so incredible I could hardly wait until my husband got home to try it! In fact I'm cooking it tomorrow

This was good. Not as amazing as some of the reviews led me to believe. I used Jack Daniels bbq and added some onion. I cooked on high for 3 hours and then shredded the chicken and cooked another 2 hours on low. The flavor is good but was expecting more of a pop to it.

I used a molasses based barbecue sauce (The Shed Barbecue & Blues Joint sauce) and added one sliced red onion and three minced garlic cloves to the recipe. After three hours of cooking on high, I drained most of the liquid and added an additional half bottle of barbecue sauce. I finished cooking an additional hour and it was perfect! Thanks for the recipe. Update: If you make this the prior day to serving, stop cooking at hour three and shred the chicken and DO NOT DRAIN. Then refrigerate the container overnight and the next day cook an additional hour. All of the extra liquid will have been absorbed and you don't need to use more barbecue sauce if you don't want.

This is my first time rating a recipe but I had to because this is delicious! I'm a very novice cook so I look for easy  and delicious recipes and this one delivered! The only difference I made was seasoning the chicken with salt and pepper before putting it in the crock pot.

One of my favorite go-to fall recipes. We are gluten free, so its perfect, just watching the BBQ sauce and its ingredients. I make with tater tots + cheese or sweet potato fries + coleslaw. Yummy. I add minced garlic, and onion as well. I also use fresh chicken breast.

First of all, I rate almost every recipe 5 stars. I think anyone willing to share recipes deserves high scores in my book.  If I don't like a recipe I just don't rate it.  THIS CHICKEN IS A GREAT PARTY MEAL.  I more than doubled the recipe and took the advice of another reviewer and cooked the chicken last night in broth, shredded the chicken this morning and we'll be having them in a couple of hours for my sissy's bday celebration.  The chicken tastes phenomenal even cold. I did add some of the chicken broth less the fat (it floats to the top and hardens in the fridge) to the sauce.  The same reviewer also suggested brushing the rolls with olive oil before toasting.  If I had thought of it I should have made a cabbage slaw to go on top. I can't wait for the feast to begin. Thanks for the recipe and for the added suggestions.  Maybe one of these days I'll share

So easy to make and delicious.  I was overwhelmed by the all the different kinds of BBQ sauce at the grocery store and after much deliberation decided to use Jack Daniels Original No.7. I was skeptical about using frozen chiken breast instead of fresh but it turned out great!

Very tasty and super easy!  I personally would not say that it was very zesty, however if you used a zesty italian dressing and a spicy BBQ sauce it may add to the zest.  The leftovers the following day were much more flavorful than the day that it was prepared.  I served on a fresh roll with dill pickle slices :-)
I will definitely be preparing this again!!

Using the exact recipe but halving everything. This was the BEST BBQ pulled chicken. Chicken wasn't dry. Sauce perfect. I cooked 3 boneless chicken breast thawed. On high for almost 3 hrs. Removed and using forks made bigger chunks so wouldn't turn to mush. Cooked for almost another hr on low. The last 1/2 and hr took lid off so it wouldn't be dry. I'm cooking it right now and oh sweet baby ray tops it off!!

Made this recipe just as described, only adding 1 tsb liquid smoke.  Cooked on high for 3 hours than removed lid and cooked liquid down for about an hour.  Was perfect!  Hint......make a day ahead of time for spices to blend.

I must say that I was nervous when I was making this recipe.  For one, Italian dressing seemed like it would be funky with barbecue sauce.  Then I thought maybe adding brown sugar would make it a little sweet, but for a good review, I did it anyway.  I put it on high for 4 hours, and after hour 1, it was still a frozen mass.  Didn't break apart until after hour 2.  Was hard feeling at hour 3.  But after hour 4...oh wow!  Pulled apart and was melt-in-your-mouth tender and very flavorful.  Yum!

It was really good.  I followed the recipe, used 5 fresh chicken breasts and a bottle of Sweet Baby Rays along with the other ingred. I put it all in the crockpot on low for 5 hours.  It was perfect to take out and shred at that point.  I kept it on warm for another couple of hours and then we ate it on buns.  Everyone loved it and went for seconds!

Loved it! Easy! Set and forget. We used the chicken for BBQ Nachos. We hurt ourselves. We had to get it out of eye view/ arm's reach to stop eating it. Saving it!

More than an Awesome Recipe! I made this recipe tonight for dinner. I used only 4 good sized frozen chicken breasts, washing and trimming them first. The only changes I made was obviously to the sauce. I used about 3 tablespoons more of brown sugar, 8oz. zesty Italian dressing, 18oz. Sweet Baby Rays Cola BBQ sauce, a dash of adobo, a dash of adobe pepper sauce, salt and pepper to taste. Half way through the cooking time I took the chicken out and shredded it, then returned it to the pot and stirred it into the sauce. The total cooking time was 5 hours on low in my crock pot. After the 5 hours I lowered the setting to warm for about 1 hour then shut the pot off. The more you let the mixture sit it will soak up all that lovely juice. I served the BBQ chicken on Hawaiian Sweet Rolls with coleslaw on or off to the side. Me and My better half loved it. Try it! I know you will love this easy tasty recipe too!

Pretty good as is, but I had to make a few changes. I rubbed salt, pepper, onion and garlic powders, and paprika under the skin of unfrozen chicken (food safety courses teach not to use frozen meat in slow cookers because it spends too much time in the 'danger zone'). Then I placed the chicken  in the cooker on top of balls of foil and added about 1/3 c water and some liquid smoke to the bottom. After 4 hours on low I lifted the chicken out, removed the foil, and drained the juices, then shredded the chicken and returned it to the cooker with sauces and cooked another hour on low. A couple notes: whenever I make this I add extra chicken initially, then set it aside before adding sauces so I already have perfectly cooked chicken for salad or whatever else. And if you don't have Italian dressing, you can just do what I did, after topping with BBQ, drizzle with olive oil, red wine vinegar (or any wine vinegar), lemon juice, and parsley and oregano to taste. Finally, if you use a sweet barbeque sauce (I used honey barbeque) do NOT add the additional brown sugar, it makes it far too sweet. Don't be put off by the BBQ and Italian dressing combo, it makes an all around crowd pleaser that was enjoyed by everyone in my family.

ONLY TWO HOURS IN THE OVEN! I lightly seasoned the breasts with sea salt, pepper, and garlic powder before slow cooking in the oven in a roaster (my slow cooker is broken) at 250 degrees for 2hrs. So tender and juicy!!! Just shredded the breasts with 2 forks. Made delicious sliders! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I made this tonight for my boyfriend and I. We both liked it however I think next time I'll skip the brown sugar as I sound it a bit to sweet for my linking. Also I used 4 large breasts and I still had plenty leftovers. I think next time I'll just use three breasts instead.

I used thawed chicken breast about 1.5 lbs.  I used original Sweet Baby Rays.  I added chopped onion and garlic in addition to the other ingredients.  The flavors worked well together. I cooked this on medium heat in the slow cooker 3 hours, then shredded the chicken and returned it to the pot to continue for another 2 hours. Very tasty and easy to make.

Love this recipe and make it often.  The first time I followed it exactly and was not thrilled with the results.  It was way too sweet for me.  The BBQ sauce I used was sweet baby rays original so maybe thats why.  I had to add a lot of salt to cut the sweetness and I also added crush red pepper flakes.  Now when I make it I only do 1 tbs of the brown sugar.  I also add about 1tbs of the crushed red pepper flakes and about 1tsp of salt.    Also a reviewer commented on that the chicken should be thawed not frozen- I have made it both ways just because 1 time I only had fresh chicken.  It works fine either way. If its thawed you just cut back on the cooking time.  Also, this recipe does not address actually making this BBQ.  I check the chicken when I think it is cooked through and take it out and shred it and then place it back into the crock pot to simmer another 30-45 minutes to soak everything up.

So easy and so good! I took the suggestion of adding liquid smoke and also garlic. I serve it on rolls with coleslaw. Perfect meal when it's too hot to be in the kitchen. And the leftovers are - if there are any - are even better!  Thanks for sharing this, Zanne Tastic.

I am new to allrecipes, and came across this recipe while just looking around. I used pork tenderloin instead of chicken, with Stubbs BBQ sauce, and substituted vidalia onion dressing for the Italian. Cooked the defrosted pork in the crockpot on high for 3 hours, and then pulled it apart using two forks. It came apart effortlessly. I took some of the excess BBQ sauce from the crock to be used if needed when building the sandwich. I put the pork back into the remaining sauce and continued cooking for an additional hour on low setting.  Served on a nice kaiser roll with some red leaf lettuce, red onion, and a side of applesauce. It was perfect. Sorry to change the ingredients, but I used what I had out at the time. I will try it with chicken next, and I  am certain it will be just as good. Love the site. Thanx.

LOVE!   Made almost exactly as is posted.  We only had 4 Frozen Chicken Breasts, so that is the only difference.   We used Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ Sauce.   This is definitely a KEEPER.  Everyone loved it.

This got absolutely rave reviews!!!  I actually used this recipe to cook the rabbits my wife and I raise, as follows: two whole rabbits, meat cut off the bone; browned briefly in bacon grease; placed in slow cooker with the sauce exactly as written (yes, using good BBQ sauce); cooked one hour on high and four hours on low (just due to time restriction, not any specific strategy); shredded meat with forks and left in slow cooker on warm; served on buns with coleslaw and pickles available to put on top.  This was one of my very favorite rabbit recipes yet, and I will make it again and again, just like this!!

SUPER EASY to make and SUPER DELICIOUS! I made this to surprise my husband and he absolutely LOVED it.  I made this using frozen chicken breasts, adding this straight to the slow cooker, without defrosting, still made delicious results! Will definitely be bringing this to the next neighborhood BBQ!

I totally forgot to put the Worcestershire sauce in...DOH! Ok so I used Stubb's Hickory BBQ Sauce which is made with molasses and just about the best most expensive BBQ sauce you can get at any local store in these parts. I used a Kraft brand zesty style robust Italian dressing, Put on high for 2 hours then low for 3, then separated the chicken and put it back in for another hour and a half. This was SO good! I will add the Worcestershire sauce next time though. I bought a 24 pack of sliders and there was enough to fill up 18 generously. I added a slice of red onion and some chipotle white cheddar to the sliders as well. The family was happy. So will make again. Probably double it next time though. Leftovers can be used for a large BBQ chicken pizza. This stuff undoubtedly goes fast!

AMAZING.  So easy.  I used frozen chicken breasts and let it cook all day on low.  Then I let it rest overnight (only because my kids got sick and were not hungry) and then heated it the next day.  I pulled the chicken i the cooker it literally fell apart it was so easy.  The entire family devoured it.  This one will be in our rotation for years to come.

Great recipe! I use fresh chicken breast, shred after 3 hours on high, before putting the chicken back into the sauce season the chicken with salt, pepper and garlic powder. Return to sauce and  Cook 1 more hour on low.

This gets 5 stars for being good and so super easy. I didn't change a thing for the maximum easiness - used 4 fresh chicken breasts, most of a bottle of good bbq sauce and cooked on high for about 4 1/2 hours. The chicken was perfect and the kids liked it. We'll make this often!

This was excellent. My sauce wasn't watery at all. But I did, take the advice of another reviewer and shredded the chicken and put it back in the cooker. This was a big hit and is now part of my easy dinner go to box. Love it. Thanks for posting.

This was easy and great. After reading previous reviews, I also added the teaspoon of liquid smoke, chopped onion and 2 cloves of garlic. Used sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ sauce and Basalmic vingrete because it is what I had on hand. The labels on the BBQ sauce and salad dressing looked like they had quite a bit of sugar already, so I omitted the brown sugar from the recipe. Everyone loved it. Kids and husband ate it with tortillas, salsa and cheese. My mother-in-law and I ate it plain.

Adjust time to 5 hours on low, shred chicken at 4 hrs, serve at 5 hours.  And yes, use good bbq sauce.  I used Baby Rays.  Perfecto!

Thawed chicken overnight. Used the Jack Daniels Hickory Brown Sugar sauce.  Also added 4 tablespoons of Spicey Brown mustard to the sauce mixture.  Cooked on low for 3 hours, shredded and then another 3 hours.  Served on good quality hamburger buns with mozzarella slices. Love this easy, delicious recipe!

This is AWESOME!  I've made it with Sweet Baby Ray's a few times and today I'm trying it with the Jack Daniel's Spicy BBQ!  I put raw chicken breasts in the crock pot and cover it with chicken broth for a couple of hours on low.  Then I drain the broth out as per the other reviewers suggestion and took a pair of tongs to it to shred it.  Super easy.  I then sauté my onion till it looks translucent and coat them with brown sugar.  throw that in the pot, then do a couple cloves of garlic and throw that in with some bell peppers.  I, myself, am not a big fan of chicken, but the BF loves it as he thinks its better than pork (i disagree) :P But the BF gets what he wants and he LOVES IT!  Always takes the leftovers to work.  I'm gonna try it with baked potato, that sounds yum!  :)

Great easy BBQ on the stovetop! I used a large deep skillet and simmered boneless chicken breasts in the sauce about 2 hours. I didn't shred this and left the pieces whole and it still made a fantastic dinner. I used Bullseye bbq sauce and made a packet mix of Good Seasons Italian dressing with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. This will probably very according to the sauce used. I did add a little mesquite liquid smoke to this for a more outdoor bbq taste. Very good recipe, very goood barbecue even if I didn't use the crockpot. Thanks for the great meal. Very tasty. Very Yumm!

Awesome, I always use Bullseye Chicken and Rib Renegade for the BBQ sauce, the added ingredients really make a really yummy BBQ sauce. I have also used this BBQ sauce for pulled pork.

This was the first recipe I have tried on here and the only one I could make without messing it up. It's a hit for everybody I make it for and now the only thing I know how to make in the crock pot. In fact, I just got on here so I could print it because it's for dinner tonight :) THANK YOU!

I use this recipe over and over-it is one of my "go to" dinners. I have changed a few things along the way to suit my family's preferences. First,I cook the chicken only with garlic powder, powdered hickory seasoning and salt. When the chicken is done (4 hours on high for a BIG batch (I made 7 lbs this time), I use a baster to remove 2/3 of the chicken broth/juice,and set it aside. I then add barbecue sauce, and the recommended amount of vinegar and Worcestershire sauce to taste,but I skip the sugar because I don't like it sweet. Finally, I add back some of the broth, but not too much or it gets watery. What a great, easy dinner for company too.Serve with coleslaw-mandatory!

This is amazing! like other people mention here, it is better to cook the frozen chicken first for about 3 hrs on low. I cooked it with onion and garlic first and drained all the liquids after 3 hrs. Then I put the BBQ sauce mix (I only put 1 tbs of sugar,since BBQ sauce is usually sweet enough) for another 3 hrs on high. It turned out very tender and flavorful.

I loved this recipe! I made it yesterday! I had it in the crockpot for 8 hours on low. When it finished I shredded the chicken with a fork and put the lid back on to let it sit in the pot for another hour when the crockpot was not on (just warm from all that cooking it did). And I would recommended putting 3 cups (instead of 1.5 cups that it calls for) of Sweet Baby Ray's Original BBQ Sauce. It makes a lot but great for leftovers or a small party with friends! I want to say it serves about 20 when you are making them for BBQ pulled chicken sandwiches.

excellent recipe,one you can play with. I added chopped onions,and minced garlic. used six breasts. Cooked on high 3 hrs, shredded, cooked on warm setting for 1 1/2 hrs. because that's when I needed it to be done. family loved it. I didn't add flour like others suggested, because we love the messiness! Will definitely make again! thanks for the recipe!

This was quick and easy to make, but a little lacking.  I will use other reviewers suggestions next time, adding liquid smoke, garlic, onion & green pepper.  I'll also try a better bbq sauce.

I know it has been mentioned before, but it can't be stressed enough; use a good barbeque sauce. The first time I made this, I used Sweet Baby Ray's and it was delicious. The second time I used a cheap, generic brand and it turned out, well, not so good. Now when I make it, I only use the good stuff. 
This recipe alone is reason enough to buy a slow cooker!

I made this for my son's birthday party, and almost everyone who went asked for the recipe! I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ, and before the last hour was up, shredded the chicken and it absorbs so much more sauce. At first I thought it was too runny, but after doing this, it came out perfect! I love how simple it is! And leftovers, if you have any, are amazing. My husband had me make this twice the first week I tried it. I will keep this recipe forever. And easy to adjust with different flavored dressings and BBQ sauces. I've found it's very forgiving for substituting. TRY IT!!!! Nobody could believe how simple it is! Put it in, and come back the last hour to shred and enjoy!

I used breasts and wings and when I had my first mouthful I knew I was in BBQ heaven.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's, Newman's Own Italian Dressing and added quite a few shakes of Sriracha.  OMY!  Super delicious.  Thanks so much.

Great recipe!  I make it just like it says, using Kraft "Zesty Italian, fat free" dressing, and "Sweet Baby Ray's 'Sweet Vidalia Onion'" BBQ sauce.  Sometimes I add a little more dressing than what it calls for.  Also, if I need more BBQ sauce, I typically add the SBR "Sweet and Spicy" sauce, to give it a little more kick.  

Really easy recipe.  I cook on low for maybe 4-5 hours and then shred the chicken and let it go another couple hours. 

We've made up several batches of this for my daughters 1st birthday party.  We've cooked it up, put it in bags, and have a few frozen ready to go.  Hopefully we can just thaw them and pop them in the crockpot on the day of the party!  Haven't tried freezing this before so I hope it turns out ok....I'm sure it will.

I thought it was great. There's nice flexibility because you can alter the barbecue sauce and type of Italian dressing every time you make it. I used half honey and half hickory barbecue sauce. I'm not sure we needed a video to open bottles and poor them into a crock pot though!

this was very good. best to shred chicken after cooking and return to crock to heat through.using thawed chicken breasts is better because they won't make the sauce watery like frozen ones. delish served on burger rolls with coleslaw or filling for quesadillas.  will be making this often.  great for summer, too. won't heat the kitchen up.

This is a simple and delicious recipe. I'm a terrible cook and it comes out perfect every time. I like my food a little spicy so I use Frank's RedHot Kickin' BBQ sauce and a few dashes of liquid smoke. Also, I'm allergic to soy so I make homemade Italian dressing with a recipe from this site. Here's the link:

I did it with fresh chicken breasts and cooked it for less time.   I put it on pretzel buns with cheddar cheese and a few pickled jalapenos.  Delicious!

LOVE this recipe. What a great use of chicken breasts and so easy. First time I made this was for camping (prefer slow cooker for camping so I can have a meal ready after a full day of play). Pre-measured salad dressing, sugar and Worcestershire and put in baggie. When we got to camp I just threw in all in the crock. Our preferred bbq sauce is Dinosaur. When you open the crock at the end of cook time you're going to see a whole lot of liquid. No worries. Grab a couple of serving forks and shred away, the liquid will be absorbed in no time.

This was so delicious! Made it for my roommate and our boyfriends, and used 6 chicken breast halves. It was more than enough food, we even had leftovers. I shredded it an hour before serving it. The sauce did seem watery at first, but after shredding the chicken it seemed to thicken up. I served it on some bulky rolls with corn on the cob and it was perfect! Will definitely make again.

This was quite good. I followed the recipe other than using fresh chicken and a tad less sugar.  It was still too sweet for us so I would cut the brown sugar in half next time.  But, we also use Sweet Baby Rays Honey BBQ which is sweet already so a different BBQ and the sugar amount might be just fine.

I made this for a large crowd and it went over really well!  I used 25 (thawed) skinless, boneless chicken thighs.  Since I was cooking so many I doubled all of the ingredients, in addition to adding some minced garlic.  I actually used 3 bottles of bbq sauce.  I divided the 25 thighs and put half in my crock pot and half in my dutch oven.  After doubling the ingredients - it makes a lot -  I put ONLY half of it, and divided it among the 2 pots.  I put the crock pot on high and the oven on 300 degrees and cooked both for 3 hours.  After 3 hours, it looked about done and was very watery.  I removed most of the liquid from both pots, put the meat from the dutch oven into the crock pot and dumped the remaining bbq mixture into the crock pot.  Cooked on low for another 1/2 hour.  I didn't need to shred it as it literally fell apart.  It was delicious!  Great dish to make for a crowd!

The best home made BBQ I have made. The chicken falls apart after marinating in the wonderful juices. I added 1 cup of chicken broth and 3 pieces of pork fat. Yummy BBQ. Will make again again!

I am giving this 5 stars even though I didn't make it exactly as described as I am sure the original recipe is delicious.  I was anxious to try it but wanted to use things on hand.  I used frozen chicken tenders, Spectrum barbeque sauce and added dark agave syrup instead of brown sugar.  I didn't have ready made Italian dressing so I just added some olive oil and white wine vinegar with Italian spices.  I cooked for 4.5 hours on low and ended up with a delicious meal!

This is a terrific recipe following some of the other suggestions. Do use a good BBQ sauce, cook the chicken first then add the sauce and let simmer for a few. My husband was totally wowed by this and made sure I have the recipe an will make it again.

This is one of my to-go Crock-Pot recipes. It's so easy and delicious. Other reviewers said to add flour to thicken the sauce a bit, and that is a great idea. I also add some salt/pepper and garlic powder to the chicken before putting it in the Crock-Pot. Love this recipe!

Tasty, but not "out of this world". I did use Jack Daniels BBQ sauce, but omitted the Italian. Still it was a little to much sauce for our taste.

Excellent, easy recipe. Kick this baby up to five stars by using some Newman's Own Lite Lime dressing instead of the Italian, and Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ sauce. Do yourself a favor and prep this a day ahead. The flavor draws through much more after a day in the refrigerator -- and it reheats very well.

Followed the recipe and did what others suggested.  Used a quality barbeque sauce and added 1 teaspoon liquid smoke and minced garlic.  Served on fresh bakery sandwich buns with sides of corn on the cob, cole-slaw and chips.  Wow- what a tasty meal!  Like going to one of those fancy smoky bbq joints.  I got a late start and cooked it for 3 1/2 hours.  Came out perfect.

Very tender chicken with a great taste that I attribute to the italian dressing which really makes the chicken stand out. I vamped the recipe a little bit to suit my own taste. I added 2 tsp's of liquid smoke and a tsp of creole seasoning. Its vital that you use good bbq sauce not just store brand. I used Odom's hickory and brown sugar so i could omit the brown sugar called for in the recipe which would have made it a little to sweet for me. I enjoy a more spicy bbq. Other than those minor things however it turned out great and was super easy to put together.

Absolutely wonderful!  I followed the recipe as is, remembering to add some flour about half an hour before serving to thicken it up.  Even my picky 13 year old came back for more.  And it's sooo easy.  I'll definitely be making this again!!

Used 5 fresh boneless skinless chicken breasts.  Put on high for 3 hours with 1/2 dinosaur brand bbq sauce and chicken broth.  After 3 hours took out most of the sauce, shredded, and kept in some juice for the taste of the drippings, and poured out remainder of the bbq mixture.  Set crock on low for additional hour. Lastly, turned crock on warm and let it "soak the juices up".  Served with cole slaw  Great for memorial day. Loved no fuss and spent time with family instead m To quote my husband, "I don't think there's a person out there that wouldn't like this". Defintely making again.

This recipe is simple but very good. I didn't have a lot of time so I used two hot rotisserie chickens, shredded them and put them in the crockpot. I had sweet Italian dressing so I omitted the sugar. There was plenty of sauce.

It couldn't get any easier!  I used defrosted chicken breast, jack daniels bbq sauce, added a sliced onion, cooked for 4 hrs on low then shredded it, then cooked for an additional 1hr on low.  Everyone, including my 4 year old, loved it.

I used this with a pork shoulder roast and it was really good. I gave it a four because the sauce was a bit runny and I did use a high quality bbq sauce like other comments suggested. Other than that superb. Will definitely make again:)

I liked this recipe a lot, and especially because it is super easy to make!  However, my boyfriend thought it was too salty (and admittedly, I did notice that a bit too.)  I followed the recipe exactly, using Kraft Zesty Italian salad dressing and Jack Daniels BBQ Sauce... does anyone have recommendations for salad dressing or BBQ to use that would taste less salty??

Amazingly, all my kids liked this (and one of them hates BBQ). Used Sweet Baby Ray's Honey Barbeque Sauce. Will definitely add into our regular rotation. Top with thinly sliced red onion and coleslaw and you can't go wrong!

What I did based on some reviews:

I’ve heard not to use frozen meat in a crock pot, so use fresh/thawed chicken breasts. 
Put chicken breasts in crockpot, sprinkled on salt and pepper and garlic powder, and poured in a cup or two of chicken broth (didn’t cover the chicken - it was just enough to cover about 2/3 of the chicken).
Cooked on high for 3 hours.
Shred chicken.
Put ingredients at above amounts in with the shredded chicken and cook on low for 1 more hour. 

***For the 7 chicken breasts I cooked, I nearly doubled the sauce recipe...

This is definitely a go to recipe for my six children.  Believe me, finding meals that we all enjoy is rare; this one fills the bill.  I serve it with cornbread and it's like a good old fashion southern supper night.

Awesome.  I was a little skeptical about italian dressing mixed with bbq sauce, but it was soooo good. I used Zesty Italian since that's all I had.  I did as others suggested and pulled the chicken into pieces about an hour before it was done. I did add 30 minutes to make up for lost heat when the lid was open though.

I followed the recipe as it was and the bbq sauce I chose was Famous Daves Sweet and Zesty. If I make this recipe again, I would NOT go for the sweet bbq sauce. It didn't taste all that good in a burger, but if I were to judge just the meat alone, it was very good. I was first skeptical of the salad dressing in it, but it turned out decent. My suggestion: don't use overly sweet bbq sauce and no cheap kind either.

I use thawed (not frozen) chicken breasts cut in half, and add one medium onion. After it is done cooking, I separate the chicken to the consistency of pulled pork and let it cook another half hour. I serve it in hard/sandwich rolls. A favorite game day dish :)

Delicious and Easy to make! Smells great too! I used 5 frozen chicken breasts and sweet baby rays honey bbq sauce. i wouldnt change a thing... i shredded the chicken up about half way through the cooking time to help soak up some of the liquid. Perfect, no complaints!

This recipes is awesome, of course made some changes per other reviewers.  I did everything as the recipe states, and added 1/2 an onion to the sauce.  Cooked thawed breasts for about 5 hours on low, took the chicken out to shred.  While the chicken was out, I added about 2 tbsp. Wondra (gravy flour) to the sauce because it was very watery, whisked for about 3-5 min. Once sauce was thickened added chicken back to cook for about another hour on low( it will soak up all the juice once shredded).  Turned out amazing! Also made plenty of leftovers!

I have made this almost every week since trying it out.  My husband and I both LOVE it.  He needs to take in a lot of protein (and very few carbs) each week and this is a very tastey way to have chicken.  We leave out the sugar and don't miss it.  I've used frozen and fresh chicken and have even used some of each in a pinch.  I find that the frozen takes longer to cook, so the low setting for longer works better.  After I make this up I weigh it into portions, refridgerate some and freeze the rest.  I recommend trying out different BBQ sauces for some variety.  We like Gringo Jack's and I've been using Ken's Light Italian dressing.  Wonderful!

Awesome Slow Cooker BBQ chicken recipe! I used Rudy's BBQ sauce and fresh chicken breast. I added a little bit of chicken stock to the sauce because there didn't seem to be enough cooking juice. Cooked for approximately 3.5 hrs on high. I shreded the chicken and added in more BBQ sauce at the end. I paired it with the Pioneer Woman's Cilantro Slaw recipe, pickle and roll. It was an excellent dinner sandwich. Will definitely make it again!

I used Sweet Bay Ray's BBQ sauce...can't really go wrong with that. I just boiled the chicken and shredded it.  cooked it for a few minutes to heat through. I saw this as a feature recipe and it sounded too good to wait until the next day.

This recipe is amazing! It's so simple, and I've never received more compliments on any other dish I've ever made.

The only suggestion I would add is to shred the chicken using two forks about an hour or two before it is done cooking. This gives it more of a pulled pork type of feel, and the bbq mixture soaks into the chicken even more thoroughly after it is shredded.

Also, if you like a little kick, I add some cayenne pepper powder to the bbq mixture.

5 stars for taste AND for easiness!

There were mixed reviews in our house on this one. I thought this recipe was good and my husband said it was just ok. He also thought the chicken turned out was dry, but I think it was fine with extra sauce added. I scaled the recipe to use two chicken breasts for the two of us and I used  homemade Italian dressing and didn't add the sugar since my barbecue sauce seems to be plenty sweet. I liked the simplicity of using frozen chicken in the slow cooker as well as the idea of chicken instead of pork.

I am not a barbeque person and even I loved this!  It was super easy and my entire family thought it was awesome!  I made it just as the recipe calls and it was perfect...I won't change anything when I make it again.  :)

Easy and tasty - but messy on a kaiser roll like the picture.  Try a hoagie roll instead :)

I make a ton of shredded sandwich fillings in my crockpot.  I am not a fan of BBQ that has BBQ sauce in it. So I was leery of this recipe.  I made it exactly as written except I scaled it in half.  I wish I would have made the full batch.  It was very good.

Absolutely delicious!  Used recipe as is.  I did ladle out some of the juice before shredding and then put back in what I wanted.  The next day it could've used more of that juice so if you do that, make sure you add more to your leftovers.  Thank you Zanne Tastic!  Want to try it on pizza with red onion too.

It was too sweet for me so next time I won't add the sugar because the bbq sauce is sweet enough. Overall it was good. I would make this again

This was really good.  I used a whole chicken that I had cooked earlier in the week, shredded and put in the crock-pot with the sauce mixture on high for a couple hours (until heated through).  Will definitely make again!

By far, one of my favorite recipes on this website. It's simple and tasty! I use fresh chicken breasts seasoned with salt, pepper and garlic powder.  I agree with other reviewers as you should use a good quality bbq sauce and zesty Italian dressing.  Also, shred chicken and put back in the crock pot about an hour before serving.

I made this lastnight and had it for dinner today. It was wonderful. I was a little nervous about the brown sugar and Italian dressing; which I used Good Seasonings, but it had an amazing flavor. I will definitely make again!

These sandwiches are delicious! I didn't add the brown sugar because I didn't have any, but honestly I don't think it really needed it! I wouldn't have wanted it any sweeter. I only used about 2/3 of the bottle of barbecue sauce which was plenty. I also added some chopped onion to the slow cooker, and added some lettuce to the sandwich. It only needed about 6 hours on low and the chicken shredded very easily. Like others have said, stir the chicken after shredding and let sit for a couple minutes to let the shredded pieces absorb the sauce. 
Served with some spicy baked beans. Delicious!

I am new to cooking, but this recipe was so easy!! My boyfriend and I make it all the time and love the left overs. I took some of the advice from the other reviewers and shred the chicken an hour before it is done to soak up some of the bbq sauce. I also leave the top off the last hour. IF you don't have worcestershire sauce on hand it tastes good with out it. My boyfriend made this for his work and it went fast we thought we'd have left overs and didn't. Love Love Love this recipe! Thanks Zanne Tastic :)

Loved it. I used Chicken tenderloins instead of the breasts because that is all I had. guessed at how many to put in the slow cooker but it was so easy and great. They asked after dinner for me to make it tomorrow...

This is definitely a keeper.  One of my husband's favorites and my family go to on busy nights.  The key is to shred the chicken for the last 30 minutes or so as others have stated.  Also, toasted bun.

Oh, my goodness!! This is the BEST BBQ chicken I've ever had! LOVED it!!! When I went to shred the chicken, I just touched it with my fork and it fell apart. So moist and juicy.  I followed the recipe/directions exactly except I didn't have Worcestershire sauce.  I had read somewhere other people say never use the frozen boneless chicken breast halves in a slow cooker because they always turn out really dry and not good, so I was a little concerned.  Well, this Amazing recipe just blew that theory out of the water!! I've never had such moist, juicy chicken as this was.

I made this receipe twice.  First time I followed the directions exactly and it was a bit too sweet to me with no spice.  2nd time I made a few modifications to add some spice to the sweet.  2nd time I used a sweet and spicy BBQ sauce, added half a chopped onion, added another tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce, used a little less brown sugar and added some red pepper flakes.  It was delish...just enough spice to offset some of the sweetness.

Excellent! I was skeptical that this few ingredients could deliver a yummy barbecue chicken but wow was I surprised! 
I agree with another reviewer that the sauce seems a bit runny until after you shred the meat and let it soak up a bit.  Served this on buns for the crew and over a salad with for myself! Super yum!
I did season the chicken breasts with garlic powder and seasoning salt prior to placing in crock pot & added a Tbsp of balsamic to the sauce at the end before adding to the pot because it seemed a bit sweet to me.  Perfect & easy! Great combo for a weeknight meal!

This recipe was awesome as is and super easy.  They sauce was a tad runny, but when I shredded the chicken in the sauce it soaked up most of the extra juice.  I served them as open faces sandwhiches and it topped with coleslaw.  It was awesome.  I will definitely make it again.

How much you like this recipe will depend on how much you like the BBQ sauce you picked.  I don't like sweet BBQ so I picked a vinegar-based sauce and added a little bit of Apple Cider Vinegar.  My boyfriend and I loved it!  We will be making it again and again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I needed shredded chicken for sandwiches so I cooked the boneless skinless chicken pieces in the crock pot first.  Good thing because it made a lot of broth which probably would have watered down the bbq sauce.  Otherwise I followed the ingredients and directions exactly.  I don't like sweet bbq sauce so I did not buy the honey sweetened kind.  I used Budweiser Original.  After tasting before adding the sugar, it did need the full amount of sugar because of the tartness of the Italian dressing.  It was good, not great.  Guests ate it and were complmentary but no real raves about it.

First time making this and it turned out Amazing!!! I used 3 large fresh chicken breasts and added 3 large cloves garlic minced and a tablespoon of maple smokehouse seasoning. Cooked on high for 30 minutes then low for 3 hours, took chicken out shredded (the chicken fell apart perfectly) and added 1 tablespoon flour for last hour. I found it cooked a lot faster than stated possibly my crock pot runs higher than others. Sauce turned out perfect, nice amd thick! We put it on baked potatoes with cheddar cheese and sour cream. We are having it for lunch today on a bun with diced onion and pepperjack cheese. I'm excited!!! This will be on the menu very often and I'm sure it will be a hit at our next family get together.

We had NO leftovers. My husband absolutely loved this chicken recipe. When he wasn't "shoveling" every morsel in his mouth, he would hold up a piece of chicken with his fork and demonstrate how easily the chicken broke apart. It was incredibly moist. The combination of BBQ sauce (we used Kraft Honey BBQ sauce - 18 oz.) and Italian Dressing is absolutely yummy. :)

I followed the recipes to a T except my chicken wasn't frozen and it turned out amazing! This will be my new go to sauce for pulled meat in the crockpot!  When the chicken was done there was tons of sauce and it was really watery but as soon as I shredded the chicken and added it back to the crockpot it absorbed into the shreded chicken completely. I think next time I will use a little less chicken so there's more sauce. I'm think 2.5 to 2.75 lbs would be perfect!! This recipe is a must try!!

YUMMM! Super easy and VERY good. Added onion and fresh garlic. Sweet- not overpowering bbq taste. Kid friendly. Even great with tortilla chips. I'm sure it would be great on a pizza.

Great and sooo easy!!! I used Baby Rays bbq sauce. I cooked on high for 4 hrs then on low for 2hrs. Afterwards the chicken just shredded apart. I will def make for potlucks/picnics. 

I read that some reviews said sauce was soupy. Thats probaly cause they needed to cook longer. I thought so too, then added the extra 2hrs and it was PERFECT! Even my picky 6yr old ate it.

I cant stress how tasty and easy this recipe was, def a favorite!

Using chicken parts made it hard to remove all the bones after it fell apart in the slow cooker.  Boneless chicken breasts were better but can taste a little dry, even with sauce on it.  Next time will try a mix of boneless breasts and thighs.

I wasn't so sure about this, I just didn't think it sounded like anything special.  But I have to admit I was very pleasantly surprised.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Threw my chicken breasts in straight from the freezer and cooked it on high for exactly 4 hours.  The chicken shredded beautifully and I served it on sandwich rolls. It would also be good served over rice or mashed potatoes.  I definitely recommend using a savory or spicy bbq sauce, not sweet.  Or if you do, just omit the brown sugar.  This was perfect for a busy school night family dinner!

This was excellent, and very easy! I left out the brown sugar and added 1 tsp of liquid smoke and 1 tsp of garlic powder. I shredded the chicken after it was cooked and served it on toasted whole wheat hamburger buns with a slice of provolone cheese. We had macaroni & cheese on the side. My husband said after eating this that "you make the BEST bbq chicken!"

Very good and VERY easy, I didn't even defrost the chicken before throwing it in the crockpot.  My 11 year old can even throw this one together.  I added a little less brown sugar since I used a honey based bbq sauce, but you should definately use a bbq sauce that you love since that is the base to this dish.  Served on buns and people could add jalapenos, cheese, or whatever else they wanted, super versitile.

I made this last night. The chicken was dry and tough. We had to throw it away and eat turkey burgers instead. I had followed the advice of other reviewers and used fresh, not frozen chicken breasts. I think the frozen breasts would have done better. By using fresh, the cook time was too long.

I love how easy this recipe is.  I usually cut the dressing in half, and add a bit of water to cut down on calories.  So cheap to prepare, too.  Delicious over garlic bread with some leafy greens on the side, and in salads the next day.  It's hard to screw this one up (bonus!).

This was awesome and so easy. I am sure it would have been fantastic as is, but I added chopped onion and a little garlic. I used the bbq sauce I had on hand, but I can't wait to try it with Jack Daniels BBQ!

This was AMAZING!  I only used 3 chicken breasts so I halfed the sauce mixture, cooked it on high for 3 hours then shredded the chicken and put back in crockpot for one hour and cooked on low and it turned out so great!  I will definitely make this again :)

Delicious!  Added some chopped green and red onions to the slow cooker. I used THAWED chicken. Shredded chicken 1 hr before serving and let it stay on warm to help the chicken absorb the flavors of the sauce.  Toasted buns and served with a little feta.

I have *just* made this and I got my kids to taste it and can not keep them out of the kitchen.  All 4 of them.   I have not changed anything about this recipe except maybe added some garlic powder.  Also, I used Original Kansas City BBQ sauce and it's a winner.  Thank you!

Delicious! I made this for a group camping trip. It was phenomenal! I made it the afternoon before we left. I shredded the chicken and put it back in the slow cooker for a couple more hours. I had no problem with runny sauce - the shredded chicken really does soak up the sauce. Baby Ray's and Kraft Italian worked well together. Adults loved it, kids loved it. I'm making it again for our next camping trip and I'll be making it frequently! Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe was awesome! I could definitely taste the Italian dressing, and that bugged me somewhat. But the anyone who didn't know what the ingredients were, loved the recipe. My family doesn't eat pork, so this is a great alternative to pulled pork sandwiches. I will definitely use this recipe as a base recipe and maybe change up  the ingredients a bit. Easy as is possible. Love it!!!

I added some onion and this chicken was sooooo delish! Used fresh chicken breasts cooked on high for 3 hours, shredded the chicken (so tender it just fell apart) and then cooked on low for another hour.

After reading all the reviews, I made a few changes. First, I put frozen chicken breasts in slow cooker on high for 3 hours with some chicken broth, worcestershire and a little liquid smoke. Then I drained the broth, shredded the chicken and added a bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's original bbq sauce, 2 Tbs Worcestershire, only 1/4 cup of Italian dressing, NO brown sugar, 1 tsp minced garlic and added half of a finely diced red onion and finished it on low for another hour. The chicken was very moist, shredded easily and had very good flavor. I only gave 4 stars because I changed it a bit. I will make this again with my modifications.

Turned out great! I didn't have worcestershire sauce so I used 1 tablespoon of a1 and 1 tablespoon of soy sauce. I also added 1 tsp of liquid smoke.

love this recipe.  my sauce was watery, so next time i'll just reduce it to thicken it up.  other than that, it was great!  I used 4 HUGE chicken breasts and put them in the pot frozen.  i then put the sauce in (didn't even season the chicken) and cooked it on low for 7 hours.  the meat just fell apart!  we served it over white rolls.  sooo good.

This was SO good!!!! I used defrosted chicken.I tried other members' suggestions to add powdered Italian dressing, onion, and liquid smoke. The sauce was thin for my taste, so I added flour at the end of cooking to thicken. I served this with corn on the cob and restaurant style potato salad (found on this site). Thanks for a new slow cooker recipe.

I enjoyed this recipe much more than I thought I would! I used 3 large thawed boneless skinless chicken breasts, which I seasoned with salt, pepper, and onion powder before pouring on the sauce. I also added in a few dashes of garlic powder. After the flavors simmered together for a couple of hours it really hit the spot!

This was good and certainly easy.  We used the honey flavor of K C Masterpiece.  Because I didn't want it to be too watery, I used dry Italian dressing mix instead of the prepared dressing.  Served on potato rolls - yum.

I made it as is with top of the line BBQ sauce.  I found the Italian sauce to be too strong, and somewhat bland.  

After at least tasting it the original way, I almost completely changed it by adding a lot of spices and worcestershire sauce, and a touch of soy sauce.  This helped a lot.  After that, it was definitely good.  But it seems like a lot of work for something I can just get out of the BBQ sauce itself.  I wouldn't make this again... not that it was bad, but it just didn't stand out from anything I can get from the store.

This was fantastic and very flavorful.  I used a Stonewall Kitchen maple barbecue sauce and a fat free Italian dressing.  I did not shred the chicken either.  Made some rice and the sauce from this over the rice was perfect.

I have made this about 5 times now, and it's been delicious EVERY time!
My husband will normally not eat leftovers, but he will with this! It's a BBQ miracle-worker! ;)
I tripled this recipe for a crowd of about 20 and they all loved it. Yum! Thanks for making me seem like such an amazing cook!!

This is fabulous.  I love BBQ sauce, so I didn't figure I would hate this, and I really liked it a lot.  I'm making it today for the second time.  I used 3 chicken breasts both times but kept the rest of the recipe the same and I didn't feel it was too saucy.  I also didn't have watery sauce like others have said.  I served it atop slices of bread open-faced since we didn't have buns and it was delicious.  Today we'll have it on wheat buns.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's (my favorite) and home-made Italian dressing.

I've been making this recipe for a few years now. It's a favorite in my family and my go to dinner when we have guests coming over. It's so easy and everyone loves it. I def. recommend shredding the chicken about 2 hours before it's done.

Awesome! I loved this recipe! The sandwiches from this were great, we couldnt get enough of the sauce. It makes alot of chicken, and I ended up throwing away the left-overs after a week, but i think next time i'll try making a bbq chicken pizza with the leftovers. Thanks for a keeper!

Easy, cheap and delicious.  I recommend that after 3 or 4 hours you take a fork and shred the meat.  I used chicken on the bone because it was on sale and it worked fine.  I just pulled the bones out after a few hours because the meat just falls off.

soooo good! My hubby loved this and he is pretty picky when it comes to chicken. We are from KC and used 4oz of Arthur Bryants sauce and 8oz of Gates mild. Awesome. Started with 3 frozen chicken breasts and cooked 3 hours on high and then shred....then 3 hours on low. Served on wonder bread buns. Yummy.

This was so good! My daughter shared this recipe with me and it was awesome. I also recommend, as others did, shredding the chicken at the end and letting it simmer in the crock-pot, as it does soak up more sauce. Also I buttered the rolls, sprinkled them with garlic powder and broiled just a minute or so. Yummy!

Used Sweet Baby Ray's and I too omitted the brown sugar and shredded chicken half way through.  Not as much sauce as I expected but still DELICIOUS!

This was a great Sunday Afternoon lunch!  I was a little frustrated to when I didn't have any italian dressing in the early morning of prepping for this and noticed on the reviews that the dressing is what made it. I found the "Italian Dressing Mix" recipe on this website and spent five minutes making homemade dressing to add.  I'm so glad I did, because it turned out fantastic!!!

I make a huge crockpot of this for my husband and I.  We use it on sandwhiches the first night and save some for later.  It freezes very well.  We also love to put it on salads (no dressing required) and on baked potatoes.  My husband likes to eat it plain for midnight snacks.  Family favorite!

This was so easy and so delicious. I used Famous Dave's barbeque sauce and four chicken breasts (and just added a bit more sauce and Italian dressing). I shredded the chicken a bit before serving it and did add a tablespoon of flour to the sauce. I served it on whole wheat buns with a side of southwest style black beans. It was a hit with my husband and my toddler!

I've made this on numerous occassions with only 2 adds - 1 to 2 teaspoons of hickory smoke and a little red chili sauce for a little spice.  This work great as sliders.  I preferred dinner rolls over the mini hamburger buns.  Dinner rolls with a little melted butter and slightly toasted with shredded lettuce and sliced tomatoes makes for a perfect game day meal or just any type of meal for a large crowd.  I did this on a game day and everyone loved making their sliders as I continuously toasted the rolls and yelled "Hot Buns, come and get it" as I took the rolls out of the oven.  Mmmm mmm good!!

This was a really easy and tasty recipe.  I didn't have worcestshire so made it without and it was still good.  For leftovers the following night we served them in soft tortillas with corn, black beans, and cheese.

Very good, I used 5 fresh chicken breasts, cooked them on high for 3 hours, shredded the chicken, then cooked on high for another hour.  It turned out perfectly.  The chicken absorbed the sauce so it was thick, moist and flavourful.  With the leftovers I tossed them on a whole wheat pizza crust with some green pepper, red onion, double smoked bacon and cheddar cheese.  Then topped that with a little bit of freshly chopped cilantro.  Amazing pizza.  I will be making this again and again.

Great recipe.  I took the lid off toward the end of the cooking time to cook off some of the liquid and make a thicker saue.  Very tastey!

AWESOME! I followed the recipe exactly except I only used 4 chicken breasts. Other reviewers were correct, once you shred the chicken it absorbs more of the sauce, so it isn't too "saucy". I put the leftovers in the fridge and it was even better the next day! (I didn't think it was possible!) I toasted some sourdough with garlic butter and slices of cheddar, then topped it with the meat...WOW! Thanks for a wonderful, easy recipe!

Too much sauce for us.  It would have been better by adding a couple extra chicken breasts to soak up some of the sauce.  Otherwise its pretty good and sooooo easy!

This was delicious and we both loved it.  I used 2 frozen WASHED chicken breasts and cooked on low for about 5 hours.  During the last half hour I added some more BBQ sauce to thicken the gravy.  Served it over mashed potatoes. I use frozen chicken all the time in my crockpot despite what some say and have never had a problem.  I do, however, wash them in warm water and paper towel dry before putting in the crock.   5 stars for this recipe!

This is an amazing recipe, and super easy!! I made this for a coupke at church that just had a baby and they loved it!! I used 5 pieces of Tyson bonless skinless chicken breast and a bottle of Jack Daniels BBQ sauce. I would recomend buy a good BBQ sauce because it will affect how good it tastes. Don't go with the cheap stuff!!

I used unfrozen chicken breasts and still cooked for 7 hours on low; worked out just fine!  I found the brown suger and Italian dressing made the sauce a little too sweet for my taste, so I ended up adding extra BBQ and Worcestershire, as well as some hot sauce.  In addition, I added pepper, crushed garlic, onion powder, paprika, and coriander when I put the chicken and sauce in, and I added a little flour about 30min before I was done cooking to help the sauce thicken.

I always thought that pulled bbq pork was delicious... but turns out i LOVEEEE pulled bbq chicken! Only thing I did differently was that I added a little garlic powder and my chicken was already thawed before I put it in.

This seemed a little bland on it's own. The second time I cooked it, I added 3 minced garlic gloves, a sliced white onion, 2 tbsp of taco seasoning, a diced bell pepper, a small habanero (seeded and finely diced) and a couple of shakes of tabasco. It countered the sweetness of the bbq sauce and brown sugar nicely. If you like SPICY barbeque, these changes to the recipe might interest you.

Delicious and very easy to make!  I'm not a huge BBQ fan, but my husband is, and we both loved it!  I'll definitely be making this one again.

This was delicious! I used fresh chicken, not frozen, Sweet Baby Rays BBQ Sauce, added a little bit of molasses to it as well and also towards the end of it I took the chicken out, shredded it and then put it back in to cook for another hour. Husband loved it and I will be making this again. I forwarded this recipe on to my mom and sister-in-law so they could try it too!

I also just made this with pork(Pork Butt Roast) for pulled pork sandwiches and it came out great! Definitely recommend trying it with pork as well.

My kids are picky AND resistant to new meals.  "Can I have some more of this delicious dinner, Mama?" ought to shed some light on my  5 star rating.  Add to that the fact that it was very quick and easy to make, and gave us a wonderful smelling home to walk into, and you've got a happy mom.  This is a very tasty bbq chicken sammich recipe.  Thanks for sharing :) Went well with cheesy scallop potatoes and steamed broccoli.

This was FANTASTIC, and I'm not a big fan of meat.  My husband raved - I know it will become part of the regular rotation.  I added 1/2 onion, 3 cloves of garlic, used chicken stock instead of dressing, and shredded it with one hour left to cook.  Perfect!

Very Good! Quick and easy too! Though I added about 4 cloves of minced garlic. I agree with one reviewer, brush the buns with olive oil and toast them on a grill. It will put your dinner over the top!

ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!! I unfortunately only got left overs, but they were still to die for! I called my husband to ask him how dinner was and he was in heaven! I did about 5 chicken breasts, about 16 oz of BBQ sauce, 1/3 c. of brown sugar and about 2 tbsp of worcestershire sauce. I put it all in the crock pot (breast frozen) and left it on high for about 7 or 8 hours until it was just falling apart. I will definitely be making this regularly! It is so easy just to throw it all in there. Although, next time I might make my own BBQ sauce (Bar-B-Que Sauce on this site) to omit a lot of the sugar and high fructose corn syrup. And I might try substituting honey for the brown sugar next time.

I am giving this 5 stars because my husband said he ate it all up it was delicious. I cut the recipie down to a third the size and then slow cooked it for 6 hours for my husband when he got off work. I was not home to try it as I had class but he used sandwich rolls and loved it so thank you for the recipe!

Incredibly easy to make...and my entire family LOVED it!  It is rare to find a recipe that all five kids will devour. :)  I've made it twice now, and I agree that it is also very tasty on a baked potato.

I have made this twice now, and we love it.  I make it exactly as the recipe instructs, and it turns out perfectly.  Obviously, use your own favorite barbeque sauce and Italian dressing.

LOVE this recipe! I used fresh chicken breasts, thin sliced and cooked on high for 3 hours. Took the chicken out, shredded and put back in on low for an add'l hour. Also added diced onion (about 1/4 of the onion) during the last hour. I served on whole grain buns with a slice of Sargento Pepper Jack cheese. My mother-in-law and husband LOVED this meal! I will definitely make again!

Just made this today. Came out so much better than I thought. First time I used the crock pot and I love it! I used a sweet BBQ sauce so it came out pretty sweet. I like it but it may be too empowering for others, so next time I will use a more classic BBQ sauce. Sauce was perfect amount of thickness and I also shredded the chicken; literally fell apart. Will make this again!

If I could give this more stars I would! It was OUTSTANDING. I didn't have Italian dressing so I had to use Balsamic dressing instead. This was wonderful and my family couldn't get enough. I did shred the chicken 1 hour prior to serving and added back to the sauce to cook. I also read others comments and added garlic powder as suggested. It was wonderful. I can't wait to use this for porkchops! It's a must try!!!

I made this as a easy after-work dinner, and it turned out great! I followed the recipe to the tee. I used some chicken tenderloins I had in the freezer, and for the BBQ sauce, I used 1/2 bottle of Jack Daniels Spicy Homestyle BBQ Sauce and 1/2 bottle of Kraft Spicy Chipotle. The chicken turned out tender and very flavorful.  Like the other reviewers, I had a lot of sauce left, but it made a great "au jus" dip for the buns. Thanks for the recipe, and I will definitely make it again!

The flavor was really good! I didn't have Italian dressing, so I left it out. I added some red pepper flakes for a little spice and added an onion. We had it on buttery toasted buns with sauteed squash on the side. Yum! Used left overs for salads.

This was fantastic! I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce and added Liquid Smoke.  I also shredded the chicken an hour before it was done and then added back to sauce. Before I added the chicken back, I did add some cornstartch to thicken up the sauce and served with sesame seed hamburger rolls and coleslaw. This was a huge hit!

Absolutely delicious!!!  Used low-fat Italian dressing and some chicken thighs along with the breasts.  Makes a LOT of extra sauce so you could probably double the amount of chicken.  Would also taste wonderful made with brisket.

This is one of the easiest recipes I've ever made, and its really good! The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly. The chicken didn't take as long to cook as it says... I think all slow cookers are different. There was also a lot of leftover sauce, which I thought was kind of wasteful. I've also made this for a party and cut the chicken breasts into bite-size chunks. They turned out really well!

Awesome!  Tastes just like BBQ pork sandwiches.  I needed to thicken up the sauce with cornstarch which was no problem at all.

The sauce thinned out during cooking and I would have preferred it thicker.  Overall, a really easy recipe that will vary based on the type of bbq sauce and italian dressing you use.  Will make again but add more bbq sauce and less dressing to help thicken.

This was really quick to throw together.  I am always looking for recipes with few ingredients that are fast to make.  Granted it needs to cook in the slow cooker awhile, but a snap to get going.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce because that is what we like.  With about an hour left I shredded the chicken as suggested by other people and put it back in the sauce.  Turned out great!  I will try this with pork too.  Thanks for sharing this yummy recipe.

I would give this 10 stars if I could...wonderful flavor and easy. I did add a cut up onion to the crock and used boneless pork chops instead of chicken. I will be making this often!

Loved this recipe! I'm sitting here eating the leftovers as we speak! I was lazy and tossed everything in the crock pot and once and it still turned out great. It's got a sweet and tangy flavor. I used my favorite Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and a little Franks hot sauce. I had a TON of left over sauce so I bottled it up and it's waiting for more chicken!

Yummy - wonderful flavor! I used 6 chicken thighs and cut the amount of sauce in half but still had too much at the end, so the next time I'll probably cut back even more. My BBQ sauce was honey-based so I left out the brown sugar. Thanks for posting this recipe - it's a keeper!

Love this recipe but I've modified it a bit.  I use a little less brown sugar, add a large sweet onion and a tablespoon or two of liquid smoke.  Like previous posters, I also use non frozen chicken and cook on high for 3 to 3 1/2 hours.  At 2 1/2 hours, use 2 forks to start pulling the chicken apart and then stir well.  Delicious!

The only good thing that I can say about this recipe is that it is easy. Other than that it just tastes like chicken with barbecue sauce dumped over it. I didn't get any zesty at all. only 3 stars. SJS99

I brought this dish to a 4th of July party and it was a smash hit!  Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe.  I served different types of sliced cheese to put into the sandwich with the chicken.  Very flavorful.  I did not find it runny at all, in fact, it was perfect.  I did cook on low for 3 hrs and shredded the chicken and let simmer another hour.  I also used fresh chicken breasts.  Awesome recipe.

I have made this recipe multiple times, and each time I make it, I remember just how good it is!! The smell this slow cooker chicken makes as it is cooking in incredible. I changed only a few things. . .I make 4 chicken breasts instead of 6. It makes more than enough. I have fed 5 people on four chicken breasts. I also ONLY cook on high. I tried it once on low and it was ruined by the time it reched 6 hours. The best is when you save what is leftover and sprinkle it on pizza the next day.

This is absolutely DELICIOUS!  I was pleasantly surprised when our picky granddaughter asked for seconds, and told me several times, "This chicken is really good!" Since it was my first time of using this recipe, I didn't make any changes or additions.  It's a great recipe!

Great stuff!  I used a recipe for creamy Italian dressing from this website (though I had to substitute cider vinegar for red wine vinegar) and another recipe from this site for BBQ sauce, because I didn't have any in the house.  I had to google how to pull chicken because I've never done it before, even though I love the stuff.  Anyway, the chicken turned out really wonderfully.  We made baked potatoes and topped them with butter, cheese, sour cream, and the chicken and the next day we ate left over chicken with rice.  We'll be trying this recipe with different sauces in the future.

I would like to give this recipe ten stars!  I threw a bunch of cut up potatoes into the bottom of the cooker and they were spectacular as well!   This recipe will be put into heavy rotation in my household.

Great recipe.  I only use 3 chicken breasts, but do not cut down on the sauce-still makes 4-5 sandwiches.  Like many reviewers, I too use thawed chicken and take it out an hour before hand to shred and return to crockpot.  I have on occasion thrown in the chicken frozen as directed and it has turned out fine.  Always good!

This was quick, easy and good. The chicken shredded like a dream and the sauce was delicious. I used home made bbq sauce and home made Italian vinaigrette dressing to lower the high sodium count. It made for great shredded chicken sandwiches. I used the leftover chicken to top a pizza the next day.

This was REALLY good!  I used Jack Daniels bbq sauce and Newman's Italian dressing.  I followed the recipe exactly cooking on high for 4-5 hours.  After reading the reviews, I was prepared to make a cornstarch slurry to thicken the sauce but it was not necessary.  But I did simmer for the last half hour with the lid halfway on to let it reduce a bit, and my slowcooker is 5-qt which might make a difference.  Did want to say that right after I made the sauce, I thought it tasted odd but was delicious after cooking.  So I wouldn't change a thing.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is simply amazing! I didn't have worcestershire, so I used low sodium soy sauce and it turned out wonderfully. You must use a decent BBQ sauce and dressing for  best taste. I also left some pieces whole as the shredded can get a bit intense. Excellent with whole small red potatoes with lots of garlic.

This was so easy, and so delicious! I make my own dressing, mainly using Hidden Valley packets, and I only had their Garlic & Herb mix made with white balsamic vinegar on hand. I also used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce. The one complaint (and loss of star) is that there is too much sauce to wade through to get to the meat. Will definitely make again.

Great and easy recipe! The next day I used the leftovers to make a BBQ pizza.  I spread the BBQ chicken over a store bought pizza crust, topped with thinly sliced red onion & extra sharp cheddar cheese. Baked according to the pizza crust directions.

Amazing! my husband is not a chicken fan so we've been making bbq pork sandwiches for a while. I came upon this recipe and thought what the heck, so i cooked this up using Jack  Daniels bbq sauce as others stated. Come dinner time we made these as sandwiches and asked my husband what he thought, He said these were better than what i was using before! Needless to say I never told him this was chicken and not pork. This is now our come to recipe for bbq sandwiches (nobody tell my husband :)

Very good!  I used three large frozen chicken breasts and kept the sauce amounts the same.  I'm glad I did because the consistency turned out great.  Shredded the chicken during the last hour or so and let it soak up the sauce.  Really good over baked potatoes, hubby loved it.  We used the leftovers in sandwiches and those were great too!  Not sure how much flavor the extra ingredients add; BBQ sauce is the main flavor.  But it's nice to find recipes with ingredients I have on hand!  Thanks.
Update:  I used three large fresh chicken breasts and cooked on low for three hours, shredded the chicken and cooked for another hour.  I wouldn't use more than three breasts, there wouldn't be enough sauce.

SO GOOD. I too cut the brown sugar in half. I used Jack Daniels original BBQ sauce. I used fresh chicken breasts and cooked on high for 3 hours in crock pot.  Cooked potato's in the oven at 375 for an hour. Put butter on potato, added the chicken, topped with cheese and green onion with a dab of sour cream!!! Great meal.

Made just as written - chicken breasts were still semi-frozen when I put in.  Cooked on low for 7 hours, pulled chicken out and shredded, and then cooked for one more hour. Served on "French Bread Rolls to Die For" from this site. Topped with shredded cheddar. Placed under broiler for a few minutes to toast buns and melt cheese.  Hubby rated a 9 out of 10 stars.  I used 8 oz of Sweet Baby Rays, and 4 oz of Kraft BBQ (ran out of the Sweet Baby) and Zesty Light Italian Dressing.

This was so delicious! I followed the exact recipe and used Famous Daves Sweet & Sassy bbq sauce. I shredded the chicken & I ended up being picky about the white chicken fat floating the the crock pot and strained the sauce, after I did that there wasn't enough sauce (that will teach me to be picky!) so I mixed up some more sauce and added it to the crock pot. SO GOOD!

Honestly, dinner couldn't get any easier or tastier!  I halved the recipe, and since my chicken breasts were already thawed, I cooked them on low for 4.5 hours, shredded them, and then returned them to the cooker to simmer in the sauce for another hour.  Served on buns with a side of roasted potatoes and a glass of red wine.  It was an awesome dinner!

Easy and delicious.  I used 6 fresh chicken breasts, and cooked on high for 4-5 hours.  Used Jack Daniel's BBQ sauce (Honey Smokehouse flavor).  Shredded the chicken near the end of the cooking time, then placed back in the sauce.  Served on toasted hoagie rolls.  Makes a mountain of chicken, so I will probably cut the ingredients in half next time.

This was a very delicious and easy recipe to follow. I put it in the crock pot and just let it go. All i had to do was throw the potatoes in the oven at around five and dinner practically made itself. If you are someone with not alot of time then this recipe is perfect for you.

This was such an easy recipe to make.  I ended up using the advice of several to make mine.  I did use 5 frozen chicken breasts.  Before I added the sauce mixture I finely chopped a white onion,  I seasoned the chicken with garlic powder, pepper and Lowry's and I also added about a cup of reduced sodium, all natural chicken broth.  I then followed the recipe for the BBQ sauce mixture.  My husband bought KC Masterpiece regular BBQ sauce...that seemed to work fine.  I also didn't have enough time so I cooked all of this on high for 3 hours.  After the 3 hours, I took out the chicken and shredded it with two forks.  I also took some of the BBQ sauce from my slow cooker and placed it in my glass pyrex measuring cup and added some flour to thicken the remaining sauce.  I used a wisk to remove the lumps...this is how my mom makes her gravy too...and returned the thicker sauce to the pot....I continued wisking to ensure the thicker sauce circulated.  I returned the shredded chicken to the pot and cooked an additional hour.  My husband thought the chicken was a little over cooked so I would suggest cutting that 4th hour into half an hour.  I brushed the tops of our whole wheat potato bread hamburger bunswith an olive oil, garlic pwder and touch of salt mixture and placed the buns in the broiler until they were a tad warm and toasty.  I will devinitly make this recipe again!  DELISH!

This was fantastically easy & received rave reviews from the entire family. Seasoned 3 large thawed breasts with salt, pepper, mixed the ingredients together as described (only using 1/2 of the Sweet Baby Ray's Original BBQ sauce). 5 hours on low, then shredded the chicken & added remainder of BBQ sauce. Stirred & cooked on low for another 3 hours. Served on toasted (with butter) kaiser rolls. This was an easy dish that was sooo mouthwatering. I think I'll take another reviewer's suggestion & use the leftovers tomorrow night for BBQ chix pizza! Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good.  Next time I would cook the chicken in only the dressing half way before adding the sauce as mine started to burn.  Added diced red onion for the last 30 minutes.  Made chicken sandwiches the first night and used the leftovers for bbq chicken pizza, it was very yummy!  I even froze some of the excess as it makes a ton and it was even better the second time around.

BEST EVER bbq! I made this exactly the way the recipe says using Sweet Baby Ray's Honey sauce. My hubs LOVED it. Because we had leftovers I diced up the chicken before storing and added a little bit of the sauce to the chicken (just enough to keep it moist). The next day we made cornmeal pizza dough, used the bbq sauce, all of the chicken, onion, monterrey jack w/jalapenos and sharp cheddar cheese. BEST bbq pizza EVER.

What a tasty and simple recipe. I followed some reviews and cooked the chicken alone in broth for a 2 hours then shredded it and returned it to the slow cooker with all the ingredients for the remainder of time.  I then served it on hoagie rolls for football. Will cook again!

This was delicious! The only change I made was that I left out the brown sugar. Instead, I used Jack Daniels Brown Sugar bbq sauce. It was very flavorful! I served with baked sweet potatoes on the side.

Tasty! This one's a keeper. I used 6 fresh chicken breast halves. I put them in a 4-5 qt oblong slow cooker (not certain exactly how large is) and followed the recipe to make the sauce. I used Cookie's BBQ sauce and super cheap Italian dressing. I poured the sauce over the top and cooked them on low for 3 hours (they were fully cooked at this point), removed the chicken breasts, shredded them, then returned them to the slow cooker with the sauce and cooked on low for an additional hour. At the three hour mark, the sauce was runny and the chicken was very juicy but a bit flavorless. Almost immediately after the meat was shredded and combined with the sauce, the concoction was perfect! I served it on hamburger buns tonight, and plan to try it over both sweet potatoes and Idaho potatoes later in the week. YUM!!!

I wasn't impressed. I used Famous Dave's BBQ sauce, which has worked well for me in beef slow cooker recipes. But the sauce for this came out watery. I added some flour to thicken it up, shredded the meat and put it back in to soak up the sauce, plus added a little extra BBQ sauce near the end, but it still wasn't enough to make the chicken taste like barbecue. Plus I used fresh breasts; my guess is that it would have been even more watery with frozen. Maybe I should have slow cooked the chicken, drained the pot, then added the BBQ sauce for the last hour, as suggested by another reviewer. The chicken was nice and tender, so I'll definitely try another chicken recipe in the future. But this wasn't the one for barbecue.

wow! This recipe was delicious and spot on! I used Famous Dave's BBQ sauce (the best in my opinion) and defrosted the chicken breasts like some other reviewers recommended to keep the liquid down. My hubby and I loved love loved this and will definitely be a keeper in our recipe books!

WOW, this was wonderful. Thank you. Thank you. Everyone loved this Zesty slow cooked Chichen For once I was the one getting all the compliments.  I used a citrus based barbeque sauce, added peppers, onions, celery, carrots, a 1/4 cup of lemon marmalade, and used boneless chicken. The chicken was fall apart tasty and the veggies kept their bright color. It not only looked great but tasted perfect. A sweet tangy style chicken. My husband wants me to make this again just for our family not a big pta event. : )

This recipe definately has some good flavor but I only gave it 3 stars because there is a lot of room for improvement. I love how basic the ingredients are but adding more will help with the taste. First it is kinda sweet so I would recommend using either a more tangy bbq sauce or just cutting out the brown sugar all together since its really not needed. Also cut the chicken into pieces before cooking because the meat tends to get dry in the center. I also added chopped onion and garlic and I would also try it with some pineapple. I served it over rice instead of a baked potato and prefer it that way. Good recipe but my variation is the only way I would eat it again.

I didn't eat this the first night, my husband and kids did and they liked it.  I made a pizza with the leftovers that was great.  Will make again.

This chicken was soooo good!  I used the less expensive chicken that is individually flash frozen and followed the recipe exactly.  It was the easiest meal and everybody loved it.  It would be a great thing to make for casual company to serve on buns.  I'm going to take the advice of another member and make bbq chicken pizza with the leftovers.  Can't wait!  Thank you for the recipe.

This was awesome.  I used KC Masterpiece BBQ Sauce (low calorie).  Turned out perfect.  Will make again, but next time I am planning to add a few jalapeno peppers and some red onion to give it some crunch.

Really great, husband loved it - served on french bread, sprinkled with cheddar. I used the Jack Daniels honey bbq sauce.. I think it's a quality product, but if you use a "honey" or "sweet" bbq sauce, you probably should cut back on the brown sugar (maybe half or none at all) that the recipe itself calls for. Will definitely make again with that only change.

This was fantastic! I did follow some of the recommendations of the other reviewers. I cooked the chicken in chicken stock, drained it and then added the sauce ingredients and cooked for another hour or so. It was awesome! We had it on potatoes the first night. The next day we had sandwiches and the following evening I put it on pizza! This is a keeper! Can't wait to make it for the in-laws! You heard me right, this recipe is in-law "worthy"!

My family loved this recipe.  I had to make my own BBQ sauce and Italian dressing from scratch as I had neither on hand.  The BBQ sauce was a simple ketchup based recipe from this website and the Italian dressing was a mixture of olive oil, vinegar and herbs.  I can't wait to try it again with a different BBQ sauce.

I used pork loin.  I would wait to add the BBQ sauce ( I used a homemade version and it watered down too much, in the crockpot).. Very moist, and great for sandwiches.

I was surprised at how tender and flavorful this was.  I added onion and minced garlic.  I think that it ends up watery because so many packages of chicken today have a solution injected (as disclosed on the label)...you just have to cook it a little while with the lid off.  Very simple and good.

burned it. Could be my fault, but all the sauce was blackened and burnt. Had to throw it all away.

I halved the recipe and used only 3 chilled boneless chicken breast freshly bought from the supermarket. Everything else was kept rather closed to the recipe; except I sliced a large onion, julienned a carrot to put on the bottom of chicken breast for added veggies. I also added 1 tbsp of cider vinegar to the sauce mixture to enhance the flavour. I did listen to others' advice and invested in high quality sauce by using Hunt's Extra-Thick Honey Hickory Barbeque Sauce (coz Sweet Baby Ray's not available in our place). Cook on HIGH for 1 hour (with 1/2 hour side turning of each chicken breast to avoid hardened meat, just in case) and another 2 1/2 hour of cooking on SLOW. I also shredded the chicken 1/2 hour prior to completion time and added the mixture of 1 tbsp of corn flour + water like others to ensure thickened sauce. The meat taste wonderfully tender after sauce absorption and our whole house smelled extremely good, like others’ too...   Both of us were surprised by this uniquely flavourful supper and I brought to work for breakfast the next day to be served with high-grain bun! It tastes even better than yesterday as I am eating now and I can’t wait to get back for the leftover in the fridge….   Thank you very much for this super-easy recipe which only requires less than 10 minutes of preparation time !)

This is the greatest no fuss crock pot recipe I have found yet.  I will suggest to do the longer cook time on low.  I have done both and found that the 8 hour low cook time provides a much deeper flavor.  You can get away with 4 hours on high in a pinch.  I was quite surprised at how much we all enjoyed the chicken over a baked potato. I am thinking of putting liquid smoke in next time!

I followed another reviewer's recommendation and slow cooked the chicken breasts for about 6 hours in chicken broth and onions.  Then I drained and shredded the chicken and added a bottle of Jack Daniel's BBQ sauce and cooked on low for another hour or two.  This turned out great!  I also used the leftovers to make quesadillas the next night with cheddar, green onions and cilantro.  Will make again.

Although convenient, it was WAY too sweet!! The sugar is not needed given that sugar is the MAIN ingredient in BBQ sauce. We won't be doing this again. There was no variance of flavour on our palates, you just were left with sweet.

Wow, you absolutely can't go wrong with this one!  This came together in a snap and was delicious on buns with sliced pickles.  I used Bob Evans Wildfire sauce, delish.  Freezes well, too.  What a great recipe for a crowd!  A definite keeper!

best bbq i've ever had! tasted just like from a restaurant.  i'll never use plain bbq sauce again.  i used cheap bbq sauce because it was what i had on hand.  was a little concerned about how it'd turn out because of the other reviews, but it was still great!

Took advice from another review to season chicken ahead of time.  Slow cooked for 6hrs then added sauce and cooked for additional hour.  Everyone enjoyed.

I cut this recipe down, used 2 LARGE chicken breasts.  I was afraid of it being watery, so I cut the liquid down to what I thought it could safely cook in.  Cooked on high for 3-4 hours, then shredded and returned it to the crock.  I let it cook awhile longer and then added more sauce as needed.  I will make this again!  Like others said...use a good sauce, it makes all the difference.

Thank you so much for this recipe. I did as others suggested and purchased a good-quality barbeque sauce. I also shredded the chicken about half way through. I've given this recipe to all of my co-workers because it is so easy and delicious! A couple of them have tried it and agreed! This will forever be a favorite in our house=) I'd give it 20 stars if I could!

Can't give it the real worth of five stars, because I made too many changes. First I eliminated the brown Sugar as recommended by some others, then I used Thighs rather then Breasts as we prefer dark meat to white meat, added 1 tsp. Poultry Seasoning,1/2 tsp. ground Sage,1/2 cup diced Onion/Celery mix,1 tsp.  Mesquite Liquid Smoke, and 2 tsp. minced Garlic. Cooked for 3.5 hours on high. Paired this up with 'Bush's' Grilling Barbecue Beans and Tomato and Avocado Salad from this site. WONDERFUL. Wife absolutely loved it. Definitaly a KEEPER.

This was amazing, had guests for dinner, they could not stop raving about it. Used 5 frozen chicken breasts, cooked in broth for 3 hours on high, then shredded, added rest of ingredients, and cooked for additional 2 1/2 hours on low. Was just wonderful. Served with sauteed onions, zucchini and whole garlic cloves, red steamed potatoes and rolls on the side. Nothing left for the first time ever.

Have used this several times.  Cook it, shred it and put it back in the juice for 30 minutes or so - and then we use it for sandwiches.  A slice of cheese to top it off.  Reheats well.

It really can't get any easier than this. I always have these ingredients anyway, which is always a plus when I am on the hunt for a new recipe. My husband loves it, I put everything in one pot and go. This is exactly what a slow-cooker crock pot recipe should be. Tasty, easy, and pleasing for all. Thanks for the recipe!

This is absolutely delicious!! I followed the recipe exactly and cooked the chicken on low for 7 hours. After six hours I took two forks and shredded the chicken while it was still in the crock pot, it fell apart with ease! And, like others have said, the sauce thickened up nicely after shredding. I used a bottle of Famous Dave's Texas Pit barbecue sauce...gave it a nice kick! I'll make this often, thanks!

This turned out absolutely delicious! I halved the recipe for two of us and it was the perfect portion. I used KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce. I put the chicken in the slow cooker frozen, then I cooked on high for 2 hours and on low for about 2 more. Chicken was moist and yummy served on buns.

My family loves this recipe.  I make it a couple times a month.  Only changes are that I use light zesty italian dressing and about halfway through cooking - I shred the chicken.  Absolutely perfect

Very pleased with how this turned out.  It will go into a "regular" rotation now to be made at least once a month.  Based on reading reviews I added 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper and some onions.  Used Cattleman's BBQ sauce.  My husband (very picky) ate his chicken breast by itself.  I pulled mine apart, put it on a sub bun, and broiled it with some cheese on top.  YUM.

This meal was a HUGE hit at my house! We had impromptu dinner guests, was a quick and easy dish to serve poolside while enjoying the lovely autumn weather. Everyone raved about it, will definitely make it again. The only change I made was in using fat free Italian dressing, did not compromise the taste at all and allowed me to save a few calories.  I did serve it over potatoes, great idea and something I would never have considered. 

Thanks so much for an awesome recipe!

Sooooooooo good and very easy to make!!!  Comnes out perfect on high or low temperature.  The chicken comes out so tender and moist.  Plus, the sauce is yummy on mashed potatoes as a side.  I have made it several times for my family and passed it along to friends that like it as well.  I highly recommend.

My family really loved this meal.  I added some spices to the chicken before putting the sauce in and added a bit of balsamic vinegar to the sauce.  We ate this with mashed potatoes one night and then the next night made the best sandwiches with the leftovers.  Great meal!

This is the first recipe that I have made from this site.  I used KC Masterpiece barbecue sauce.  My family loved it and my husband told me that he would like me to make it again in the future.  That is big from him.  The only thing I added was some cornstarch to thicken up the sauce at the end.
Thanks for the great "EASY" recipe.

I did not like this at all.  It was very runny and definitely what I think of as Chicken Barbecue that one would serve on a hamburger bun.

Just tried this last night and it was GREAT!! I only used 4 defrosted boneless skinless chicken breasts and used a little less of the other ingredients. I also added 1 Tbsp of Liquid Smoke and an onion. I cooked it for about 2 hours on high and 1 hour on low then shredded the chicken. Other reviews had complained about the sauce being too runny, but the shredded chicken absorbed all the sauce. I reserved half the sauce mixture, and I stirred that in after shredding and cooked for another 30 minutes on low. It was wonderful!

finally a recipe I followed close enough I can rate!  This was really really good!  I tossed in everything per directions, chicken frozen, and cooked on low for about 5hrs.  Then I shredded everything and, knowing the delicious juices would be thinner than I like, I added about 2T cornstarch (diluted in a little water).  After mixing that in I let everything simmer another hour until my husband got home from work.  Voila!  Minimum effort and big taste!  I didn't fuss with a 'quality' bbq sauce, the 89 cent Aldi brand worked great for me.  You will want to use a brand you already like, as the bbq sauce is by far the dominant (yummy) flavor.  In fact, I may try skipping the other ingredients and only dump in the bbq next time, just to see if I taste a difference.

A good recipe to have on hand.  Perfect recipe for summer when you don't want to heat the kitchen and are rained out from using the grill.  Made the recipe exactly as written with good results.  While I LOVE the convenience of throwing in frozen chicken, I might defrost it a little next time to get rid of some of the water and also the "clotting" of the cooked juices when cooking on high temp.  Serving suggestion for leftovers: BBQ Chicken Wraps with shredded/chopped chicken, a little of the sauce and cheddar microwaved on a tortilla.  Top with chopped cilantro and more sauce.  Delicious quick lunch.

OMG this recipe is soooo good. I made this for my boyfriend whom I invited for dinner and he was licking his fingers. I made it with chicken legs and the only thing I added besides everything on the recipe was onions, lemon juice and a bit of apple cider. I will definitely make this again.

Yuck.  Followed recipe to the letter... used high quality bbq sauce & italian dressing and this was nearly inedible. How chicken floating in sauce can be bone-dry I will never know. Never making again.

I used organic BBQ sauce and added a dash of apple cider vinegar for some extra tang. The chicken was nicely cooked and moist after only 3 hours on high.  I strained the BBQ liquid, then reduced it a saucepan on medium low.  I further thickened it by adding 1T.cornstarch dissolved in 1-2T. cold water. While stirring, bring it to a boil then simmer for one minute. I stirred in the shredded chicken and served it over brown rice.  Yum! My BBQ-loving husband had 2 helpings. This would be great for potlucks too.

My husband took one bite and said "This is a keeper!" The sauce turned out great.. it was thin, but it made for a nice gravy! I used Jack Daniels No.7, fresh chicken breasts, and cooked on low for 4 hours.

This was such a simple recipe and I tweaked it a little to add some spice. I sprinkled the chicken with a Cajun spice called "Slap Ya Mama," interesting name but GREAT flavor! If you like spicy, you'll love this! I also added a tsp. of minced garlic and a chopped red onion. It was a great combination of flavors. To make it more "health friendly," I used light brown sugar and served it over light whole wheat rolls. I can't wait to make this again!

I prepared this for our Memorial Day meal. Followed recipe exactly using Splenda Brown Sugar and Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce. I overcooked the chicken just a tad (some of the pieces were dry in the middle)which I will adjust next time. The oil from the Italian salad dressing did not mix with other ingredients completely and wonder if I should reduce the amount a little. All in all, we enjoyed the chicken barbecue, especially the flavor of the sauce. LOVED IT. Will be preparing this again. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was good, but not "great".  Even though we had leftovers the next day, I still had a half breast of chicken left over that no one really wanted.  I used KC Masterpiece bbq sauce.  The crock pot filled up with so much watery bbq sauce, I had to empty it and add another batch of sauce, dressing and brown sugar mixture.  I guess I was hoping for something where the sauce sticks to the chicken more.  I'll keep looking.

I tweaked the sauce a bit by adding cayenne pepper,  half teaspoon of Liquid Smoke, powdered mustard, a few dashes of hot sauce, half an onion, and some crushed garlic. I used about half the Italian dressing and half of the brown sugar. After that, I followed the recipe exactly, just making sure the chicken was submersed in the sauce. It came out very good. We ate it as is, with smashed red potatoes and corn. I shredded the leftovers and the next day put it on buns which made for awesome sandwiches!

With Jack Daniel's BBQ sauce, this was wonderful.  Using Costco chicken breasts, I would next time use only five chicken breasts (they tend to be bigger), and I would use it shredded on a sandwich (rather than on a potato). Flavor plus!  Thanks for the recipe!

I sprinkled the fresh chicken breasts w/ garlic & herb powder & poured chicken broth in the crock pot.  Cooked on low for 6 hours.  Then took 2 forks & shredded the chicken & poured the ingredients over the chicken & cooked for another hour in the crockpot.  I stuffed mine in baked potatoes as another cook recommended.  My family enjoyed them.  I'll use this again.  Thank you.

This was great!  I added a can of Garlic Chicken Broth, cooked 6 breasts on High for 2 hours, then drained the broth, shredded the chicken, added BBQ sauce (Sweet Baby Rays), Light Italian dressing and pepper.  Then put it back in the crock pot for another hour and served on Hoagie Rolls.  It was great and my kids loved it!!

I just had this for supper tonight and it was awesome. The sauce was dee-lish and the meat was tender. I had it set on low for 8 hours. Best part is that it was so easy to make. Thank you!

very good.  I cooked very large frozen chicken breasts on low for 8 hours.  They shredded easily and I served them on buns with the sauce.  I used sweet baby ray's bbq sauce.  The whole family liked it.

Amazing! I chose this recipe because I already had all of the ingrediants for it. It was sooooo good. I used regular Kraft BBQ sauce and Zesty Italian dressing. My boyfriend LOVED it. It was a little sloppy on wheat buns but so good. I highly recommend this recipe. It is a keeper for us- I will be making it often! Thank you for sharing!

This is maybe my SECOND review ever on this site but I finally decided a recipe was definitely worth talking about. I followed this recipe exact, except I used Splenda Brown Sugar & only used 2 Breasts. My chicken was thawed already so I put it on low cooking, 8 hours, and took it our early, at about 6-1/2 hours (as it was already tender, breaking with a SPOON. Oh, and I used a Lite Barbecue sauce by Kraft, which others said was no good. It wasn't good, it was GREAT. I served it with garlic mashed potatoes using the leftover sauce for a "gravy" and corn on the cob. This was the EASIEST, best tasting chicken I have had in a LONG time, and I make a LOT of great chicken. Mmmm.

This was a very good chicken recipe. The chicken came out very moist and perfect. I used Jack Daniels BBQ sauce and also added about a teaspoon of liquid smoke to give it that BBQ joint flavor. My chicken wasn't frozen, so I cooked on LOW for four hours.

This was great!  I was very skeptical about this not turning out to be tender since chicken breasts tend to dry out easily, but they turned out soooo moist!  I cooked them on low for about 5 hours, shredded them and cooked another hour.  I then taste tested the sauce and added some more ingredients to get the taste I wanted.  A lot of people was saying that they didnt like the sauce, but just make it your own.  Get a bbq sauce that you like and add as much or less ingredients that you like to make it fit your own tastes.  I added some garlic, onion powder, brown sugar, and a little more bbq sauce at the end to make it just right.  The next day the left-overs were delicious!  We had these as pulled chicken sandwiches and I served them with the Restaurant Coleslaw recipe on the site.

This is wonderful! My family and friends loved it. Make sure you do use good bbq sauce, not the cheap stuff! I put it over drumsticks and baked it in the oven. I served it with sticky rice and steamed veggies!

My picky seven year old ate 2 pieces and then tried to get her dad's! We were all very impressed by how great this turned out. I used Jack Daniels barbeque that another reviewer suggested and it was WONDERFUL!

Excellent and couldn't be easier.  I used creamy Italian dressing because that was what I had on hand.  And I used KC Masterpiece Original Bbq sauce.  My husband has requested that I make this next weekend for a group of 15!  We may shred the chicken and serve on rolls.

Wonderful tasting and easy to make. This recipe gets an A+ from me. I followed the reipe exactly, and to the reviews to heart and used a good BBQ sauce.
Very easy to throw in the crockpot. Very tasty. Only downside was one of my four kids didn't like it. Too spicey for her. Will definitely make again and share with other busy Moms.

I don't agree with the other people who say that you have to use a goofd barbeque sauce and not Kraft. I used Kraft honey barbeque and it was delicious. I put a little crushed red pepper and garlic in also and used it on sandwiches. I didn't thicken the sauce or shredd the meat. It was still delicious just the way it was. The Italian dressing was not to overpowering as other reviews have said. It wasn't too salty neither. Great recipe that is really quick to make.

This was delicious.  I used Archer Farms Texas style bbq sauce and for the Italian dressing, I used Ken's Steakhouse Italian Northern Lite. This was so simple. My husband thinks it might be even better with chicken thighs. I will definitely make this again.

I cooked on low for 6 hours, then shredded, returned to slow cooker and cooked on low for 45 minutes...serve on buns. Is excellent and easy meal! Easy and good. I did not use frozen chicken since I have heard that is not a good idea.

This was great, but I took the chix breasts (all I had was bone-in, so I had to shred it later) in a can of chix broth, 5-6 garlic cloves and cooked it a cpl hrs on high; but I added 1/2 packet of dry Italian dressing while it cooked, instead of adding the real oily dressing later. The flavor was infused in the chix. Then drained the broth and reserved in freezer for later, & took out the garlic. Put the chix back in w/ the Sweet Baby Ray bbq, that I only bought today after reading all the comments on it. It was great!  I put a little of the broth in there w/ a cpl shakes of W. sce cooked a cpl more hours on low.  Served on buns like everybody else! Thanks for the great post!

We didn't care for this recipe.  Hubby said the sauce tasted "funny" and I agree.  I think the Italian salad dressing gives it a strange taste.  I will continue to make slow cooker barbecue the way I always have, using a plain bottle of barbecue sauce without all the extra ingredients.

This is definitely a "zesty" dish. the chicken came out very tender but perhaps a little bit too much zip for our taste! Super easy and definitely try it at least once!

I think the cooking time is far too long for this recipe, because it really dried out the meat when I tried it the first time.  After experimenting a couple of times, I've found that three hours or so on low works just fine.  I also added 1 clove of garlic minced, a dash of tobasco, 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes, and about a tablespoon of extra Worcestershire sauce for added flavor.  I agree with a couple of other reviewers that the sauce was quite thin, but it worked fine adding some of it to the leftovers because I shredded the remaining chicken and we ate it on buns.  Leftovers were great as chicken BBQ sandwiches, too!

So good!  The sauce was amazing!  I used frozen bone-in chiken with rib attached and cooked for 3 hours on high in chicken broth and seasoning, then shredded and de-boned and put it back in cooker with the sauce for another hour on low.  Served it on sourdough rolls. So easy- so yummy!

This was really good. It had the house smelling so good that I had to keep them out the slow cooker. The only thing I will change, as others have stated, is cook the chicken first and drain off the fat and grease then add sauce. But all in all this was good the meat was falling off the bones. Thanks!

This was quite good.  I had already thawed my chicken, but I still cooked it for about 6 hours on low.  The last 30 minutes I shredded it and put it back in the sauce.  We liked it a lot that way.  The sauce has a little tanginess to it from the dressing that I liked.  Not overpowering at all.

This is a favorite in my house.  So easy and has a great flavor.  You can pull the chicken for sandwiches or just serve the whole chicken breasts over rice or mashed potatoes.  I made this for my parents and my dad insisted that I give my mother the recipe!  It's so nice that you don't have to defrost the chicken in advance, and the ingredients are all store-cupboard standbys, so this is a go-to recipe.  Love it!  Thanks!

Chicken was excellent, tender and juicy not dry what so ever and just falls apart no knife needed and my husband loves it says it taste like succulent rottisiere style chicken now I did make a few changes, I used about; 1/3 cup of Lawrys Teriyaki marinade, and the Original Kraft BBQ suace, and I didn't have the Worchestshire sauce as called for in orig. recipe so I used A1 Thick and Hearty Steak Sauce and I did use mince garlic to suit my families taste I would recommend others do the same and I used diced green and white onions, Its a great recipe and you don't have to use the fancy stuff, I think what happens with some of the others is you may have to add some liquid(i did about a tablespoon of water) hour or so during cooking to cushion the chicken. Great recipe will surely keep and add to collection. Thank you for making my first crock pot experience great.

A HIT! I used 6 frozen boneless breasts, with no 'sauce' deviation. I was worried about the frozen when I left for work, but I got home to slow cooked, tender, juicy goodness. I planned potatoes and corn, but the whole family beat me home, so instead I toasted buns, and served with chips and pickles. Everyone LOVED this keeper recipe!

I thought this was fantastic.  I'm fairly new to slow cookers, and I had not been all that impressed with how all the pot roast / french dip recipes taste the same, but this was a great surprise!

I'm from Texas and thus have high standards for BBQ, and this definitely met them.

I used about three pounds of chicken breasts, a bottle of Emeril's original BBQ sauce, a 1/2 cup of Cardini Italian dressing, Annie's organic Worcestshire sauce, brown sugar, a yellow onion, and a few cloves of garlic.  I rotated the chicken breasts after 3.5 hours and shredded them after 6.

This has got to be the easiest meal I have ever prepared.  It took about 2 minutes to throw the ingredients together before work.  I actually used frozen boneless pork loin chops, then shredded them when done.  I served on whole wheat rolls with pickles and onions.  Delicious!!

this was delicious and sooo easy. Used Famous Dave's sauce and put half the bottle in with the other ingrediants to  slow cook and then shredded chicken and added the remaining sauce before serving. Everyone loved it.

It is delicious. But, any meat which is sealed with flour, paprika, salt and pepper and lightly fried to seal in the juices before cooking is tastier.

This is easy and pretty good.  I cut the recipe in half for 2 breasts and 2 chicken tenders.  I added a sliced onion and two crushed garlic cloves.  I cooked this overnight because I needed it for lunch today.  I did use frozen breats and it worked out great.  Served with brown rice and corn.  I used light Newman's Own Italian and a sweet bar-b-q sauce.

I used Sweet Baby Ray's and Kraft Zesty Italian.  The chicken was so tender it shredded easily and soaked up all the BBQ.  I had it over rice and my partner had her's on a roll.  Both ways were delicious.

This was so good.  I added some minced garlic and thinly sliced red onion.  I also put in a little extra brown sugar and some cracked pepper.  Everyone loved it! I used Kraft Honey BBQ sauce. We had this with baked potatoes.  It's definitely a keeper!

I made this the other night and it was delicious. I did it as a shredded chicken sandwich. I have to say I was a little leary of using frozen chicken breasts as I have always been told to be sure your chicken is totally thawed before using, however this came out great. It was sweet but my family really enjoyed it. I used Kraft Honey Barbecue sauce. I will definitely use this recipe again. I may try the sauce over chipped ham. Great Easy Recipe! Thanks!
Update 7/20/17 - This has become a family favorite. I omit the Worcestershire  Sauce simply because of personal preference. I like to use Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.

This was delicious as shredded bbq chicken sandwiches. I tasted it before I shredded it and it was very tender and tasty, but much better to shred and throw back into the crock pot with all the juices. A few modifications: I used 8 chicken breast halves, 16 oz. honey bbq sauce, fat free Italian dressing, added 1/2 C. water, used only two T. brown sugar... and probably didnt really need the brown sugar. I added green pepper and onion after about three hours, and it was ready to shred after two more hours. (Actually could have shredded it sooner, but might as well let it keep cooking on low if you have the time.)I was able to take out about two cups of the juice, to reserve for serving.  Really, very, good.

This recipe was okay. The chicken was dry and the sauce was not thick enough to do anything with. If I make this again I will cut the cooking time in half and add something to thicken up the sauce.

It's so easy!!  I took this to a pot luck at work and it was a great hit!!  I cooked it with most of the sauce but saved some to add at the end.  I also shredded the chicken and added more BBQ sauce!!  Jack Daniel's BBQ sauce worked great!!  I'll definitely do this again!!! Thanks!

This was the best BBQ chicken I have ever had.I took the advise of another review and bought hoagie bread and then broiled them with olive oil on top. They came out in a few minutes nice and crispy. Wonderful when combined with the BBQ Chicken. The best I ever had. Also I shredded the Chicken which was so soft it melted in your mouth. Yum Yum!

Trusting in the other's reviews, I made this recipe yesterday for the first time, for first time company none the less. I increased the recipe to 1.5 x (9 breasts, etc.) in a large crock pot. It turned out great. I used Robusto Italian and Bulls eye chipotle BBQ sauce. This definitely gave it a bit of extra kick (not too much though). I served it over wide egg noodles and cheddar biscuits with it. There was plenty of sauce to spoon over the noodles. This is a keeper.

I tripled this recipe and used it to feed lots of hungry truck drivers with BIG appetites.  They loved it.  After letting it cook for 8 hours, I shredded the chicken, emptied everything from the crockpot, gave the crockpot a good scrubdown (the brown sugar burnt to the sides of the pot) and then put all the chicken back in with some added fresh bbq sauce.  I served it on buns and got lots of compliments.  Thanks for the great recipe!

We actually shredded the chicken after it was done cooking.  The chicken absorbed all of the leftover sauce; we then served it on buns.  This recipe is awesome and I have made it numerous times.

I found this recipe to be extremely sweet. I love flavorful food but I thought this had a little "too" much flavor. Perhaps I used too much sugar or a strong BBQ sauce? As suggested, I shredded the chicken and made sandwiches. I gave it 4 stars because my husband liked it.

Love this recipe. I take the chicken out and shred it about 30-60 min. before it's done then add it back in. The sauce is a little runny for my tastes, so I mix 2 tbsp. cornstarch with 2 tbsp. water and add it in at the end to thicken it. Makes great bbq chicken sandwiches!

This was a really good recipe. You can change up the recipe by using different kinds of BBQ sauce. I took chicken out about an hour before done and shredded it. Now we will use it for BBQ sandwiches etc. SOOOO good! Thanks!

Delicious!So Easy!My husband could not brag enough about this dish! I was WAY impressed. I shredded the chicken right before we we were going to eat. I cooked 6 fresh breast for 7 hours on low. I put in 2 average pinches of brown sugar instead of 1/4 cup. The sauce is thin. I had BBQ sauce to dip the chicken in. Thx!

My husband was a bit skeptical that a slow cooker could make good barbeque chicken and he was eating his words! This recipe could not have been any easier and was absolutely delicious. I cooked it in high for about 4 hours and pulled the chicken apart for the last hour of cookings to fully soak up the flavor. Served on crusty artesian rolls. So Good! Will be a keeper in my recipe collection.

I didn't have any Italian dressing, but this recipe still worked very well. The chicken was tender and the sauce was delicious. I did 4 hours on high, and at about hour 3, I shredded the chicken  for the last hour of cooking. Great, easy recipe!

Very good recipe for those hurried/bare cupboard/what the heck am I going to make for dinner days.  I shredded the chicken breasts back into the sauce and served it on hamburger buns.  My husband and sons loved it.  I used Wishbone dressing and Bullseye bbq sauce.

This recipe was quick to make, definitely a good one for a hectic weekday evening.  However, I would not make it for guests because the chicken was on the dry side and sauce was on the watery side.  I used frozen chicken though - next time I will try them thawed.

No changes except less chicken as there are only 3 of us.  If you change the recipe it's a different recipe, so how can  you rate it?  My family loves it, and it is so easy.

4/16/19....This was so easy and delicious! I followed the recipe except added a few things as suggested by others. I used 2.5 lbs. Chicken Breasts, 18oz of Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ sauce, 1/2 cup Olive Garden's Light Italian Salad Dressing, 1/4 cup brown sugar,  2 Tbsp.  Worcestershire sauce, chopped 1 sweet onion, and 1 green pepper, and 1 teaspoon of Hickory Liquid Smoke. Cooked on High for 4 hours, served with coleslaw, maple/bacon baked beans, and mac & cheese.  Dish was a hit! Will make this again!

I have made this twice now with very little change.  The first time I stuck to the recipe except for adding a few sprinkles of spices on top of the chicken.  Because it became dry, (but not bad) I added a little broth before adding the bbq sauce.  It is so quick and easy to prepare, and you can determine how spicy it is with the bbq sauce you choose.  Thank you for a very nice recipe that I will be using again.

I made this for an event at our middle school and the teachers loved it. When I went during my lunch period it was already gone. I will definitely make again. I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and Kraft Zesty Italian dressing. To make sure there wasn't too much liquid, once I had shredded the meat, I removed most of the liquid, then put the chicken back in and added the liquid a little at a time. Turns out I used all of it, but I'd rather be safe than sorry. I used fresh chicken breasts because I much prefer them.

2 hours after everything was assembled, I added quarter slices of 1 walla walla onion. Cooked for 3 hours and then removed the chicken and shredded it and added it back to the slow cooker. Nice flavor and a great texture to the pulled chicken.

This definitely became a family favorite the first time I made it. My kids even heated leftovers, put it in their thermos to make a sandwich at school. I usually use unfrozen chicken cooked on high. It takes 3hrs max  and is surprisingly very tender. Prefect for busy days. I can’t put it in after picking up kids from school and it’s done by the time we get home from evening activities. Really yummy on a wrap too! I plan to add it to Nacho night soon.

Easy and tastes great!  Made it in a small slow cooker because I wanted a dinner for just my husband and I and yet have some leftovers.  Worked great with just 2 large boneless chicken breasts and half the other ingredients.

The recipe is great to start but what I would suggest, especially for those that had issues with it being watery, is to use thawed or fresh chicken breasts instead of frozen. Also I added along with what was called for a half a cup of apple cider vinegar and a tablespoon of minced garlic....was amazing.

We all like it a lot.  Then I made this for 16 people.  I mixed a big package of boneless thighs with the breasts.  8oz. per person.  I roasted in oven at 280 degrees for three hours. Cooled, shredded meat.  Reduced sauce for a 1/2 hour.  Placed shredded meat in slow cooker, added the sauce and more of the bottled Barb B Que sauce.  Placed on low for 3-4 hours and stirred every hour.

This meal was delicious! My whole family was going back for seconds and even thirds! I put my chicken in the crock pot for 6 hours on low and it was perfectly tender. The only thing I did add was some minced garlic and a little bit more barbecue sauce.

I've been using this recipe for at least 4 years and it never fails. My kids and husband loves it. It's so savory and just the right amount of smoky sweetness minus the brown sugar, which tends to make it too sweet if made with the Sweet Baby Ray's sauce. Even better as a left over the next day!

Very easy and very flavorful! Added the liquid smoke, definitely adds to the overall flavor. Forgot the onions, but I don't know if that would have made it better... Used Sweet Baby Ray, will try Stubbs next time. It's definitely a keeper recipe!!

I pulled this recipe off of this website at least 5 years ago and it  has become the dish all my friends want me to bring to gatherings or make for them when they come over! Always use dark brown sugar and a better bbq sauce (stay away from the cheap $2 bottle of Kraft). I like to use Stubs BBQ hot & spicy flavor. This is by far the easiest to make and is loved by everyone who eats it. Highly recommend!

Using the slow cooker is definitely the easiest way to make a tasty chicken barbecue. Next time I'll use a spicier barbecue sauce. Thanks for sharing the recipe, Suzanne!

Pretty much followed recipe exactly, though I did follow one reviewer's advice to thaw in a bowl of water and clean up the chicken a bit. I did the low setting for roughly 7h, shredded around hour 4 or 5? Left the lid tilted for last hour or so to let some liquid evaporate. Yum!

Delicious. I think it’d perfect amount of liquid for 6 breasts, once shredded.... I used 4 fresh breasts, so will scale liquid down next time. I did 3 hrs on high, shredded chicken, plus 30 minutes on low.

Best chicken bbq I’ve made and def a keeper (gets more flavorful every time you warm it up!). I used sweet baby rays sauce so did cut back on brown sugar and also carmelized some onions for the sandwiches which was delicious!  May try adding onions directly in the slow cooker next time to see how that compares to carmelized (and there will def be a next time!!!)

My fella said "I'll eat this every day", so it's definitely going into our keeper box of recipes.   I used a big package of thawed chicken breast tenders.   Only things I changed was to add a couple of good glugs (not a technical measurement, I know) of apple cider vinegar and I also cooked up some chopped onion (maybe about 1/2 a medium onion) and minced garlic (about a tsp of the ready-made minced garlic that comes in a jar).   I cooked it all in my crock pot on high for 2 hours and on low for 3 hours.   I removed the chicken and shredded it with two forks which was super easy to do and then threw the chicken and all the liquid from the crock pot into a regular pot on the stove and simmered uncovered for another hour to so to reduce the sauce and let it absorb into the chicken.   I used Sweet Baby Ray's Original BBQ sauce and Kraft Zesty Italian salad dressing (in case anyone is curious what brands I keep in my frig)  LOL

LOVE!!
I used a robust Italian dressing. And threw it in the express crock pot/pressurizer set at 1 hour.
This recipe will definitely be a staple go forward.

Superb and easy.  I use a electric pressure cooker.  put it all in for 7 mins for our pot.  When done, shred chicken and cook 2 mins.  I takes about an hour for this process.  Very tasty!

Loved it!!! Added a tablespoon of minced garlic and it was sooo yummy. I used two decently large breasts and it filled 12 medium sized sliders with meat to spare so the only thing I’d suggest is to cut some chicken out. For reference the breasts were about and inch and a half thick and four to five inches long. Delicious recipe though!!

Extremely messy, but the flavor was perfect! 

I only used three large chicken breasts, but made the same amount of sauce. ¯\_(?)_/¯

As with many others, I used fresh chicken. I cooked the dish on high for 3 hours, then shredded the chicken, then cooked on high for another 30 minutes and finally gave it 30 minutes on low. The chicken was incredibly tender.

-For the barbecue sauce, I used Jack Daniels hickory, which turned out to be a great flavor for this recipe as it adds some nice smokiness. The recipe itself takes care of the sweetness (brown sugar).
-For the Italian dressing, I used Good Seasons Zesty Italian dressing mix, which is combined with olive oil and vinegar. 
-I also added a full tablespoon of garlic.

We used poppy seed-covered kaiser rolls to complete the sandwich. As I mentioned, it was super messy, but I think that's just the nature of this sandwich!

Fabulous!  Only change I made was using fresh chicken breast and not frozen.  It was done in about 3 hours on low.  I then shredded the chicken and put it back in the crock pot on warm for another half hour.  I used Sweet Baby Ray’s Hickory & Brown Sugar barbecue sauce.  The chicken was very tender and the sauce was tangy.  I can’t think of anything that would make it better!

Made it as is....my go-to pulled chicken for hosting! Got some slider buns, & fed a crowd! Best part is you get to set it up in the slow cooker & forget about it while you party prep other things.

Was in a hurry, so didn't read any reviews and just made as stated. Well, after 4 hours on High, in the crock pot, the chicken pieces were swimming in a watery brown sauce that had very little bbq flavor ! The frozen chicken had released so much juice !  I had to spoon the sauce out and reduce it by half, on the stove and then put it back in the crock pot with the shredded chicken ! After this extra step the dish was delicious, served over baked potatoes. I used Bulls eye original bbq sauce.
Next time I make t his recipe, I will cook the chicken pieces , in the crock pot, with tiny bit of broth or water and may be some slices of onions and garlic for more flavor. And once the chicken is cooked I would spoon out most of the liquid before adding the sauce.

Ok, I have tried dozens of pulled this and pulled that recipes, NONE of which I'd ever make again.  I would definitely make this one again!  After reading a LOT of reviews , this is what I did:  1)  sliced 1/2 of a large Vidalia onion & sliced those in half.  Place on bottom of slow cooker.  2) pressed 3 cloves of garlic and sprinkled on top of onion,  3) Place 3 LARGE, thawed (A MUST) chicken breasts on top,   4) used 12 oz. BBQ sauce (I had KC Masterpiece Private Reserve on hand),  5) based on MANY reviews ONLY used 1/4 C. Italian salad dressing (we only eat Good Seasons!),  6) based on MANY reviews ONLY used 1/8 C. brown sugar,  7) used 2 T. Worcestershire  sauce.  Based on another review cooked on HI for 2 1/2 hrs, shredded, then turned slow cooker to low and cooked for about another 30minutes.   A LOT of reviewers had a problem with dry chicken. 
 I believe it's because they slow cooked it for several hours.  I firmly believe my chicken came out so tender b/c I only cooked for 2 1/2 hrs on HI and then another 30 min after shredding.  I would never cook this for 6-8 hrs! I had NO issue with it being watery like many others did.  I NEVER have good luck with chicken breasts....EVER, but, this came out so perfect!  It's super easy and super fast.  Serve on or off buns with homemade cole slaw (also super easy), veggies & pickles on the side.  This one's a keeper!  Thanks!

I love this recipe and it is so easy! I have a definite southern palette and I think it pairs best with sides of whole potatoes and green beans. The chicken usually shreds easily with just a fork!

I made this in a 5 quart slow cooker with 2 large chicken breasts and 2 boneless skinless chicken thighs.  I used Sweet Baby Rays Hawaiian bbq sauce.  It only took 4 hours on low so check your temps with a meat thermometer. 

I love the fact that it's not just chicken in bbq sauce.   It was slightly sweet and very savory.  Im not a huge fan of bbq sauce alone but the dressing  and sugar took the edge off.  I also added 1/2 cup chopped onions.

This recipe would be perfect for casual parties.   YUM.

I pretty much followed this recipe as it is here and it was really good!  I used Stubb's Hickory Smoke BBQ Sauce, added 4 cloves of minced garlic, and 1 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper to add an extra kick.  I cooked on high for 3.5 hours, pulled out the meat and shredded it, put it back in the pot for an additional 1/2 hour.  If the sauce is too thin for your liking, I would suggest mixing 2 tbsp of cornstarch to 1/4 c cold water and then adding to the sauce for the final 30 minutes of cooking.

this has become my go-to bbq for crock pot meats of any kind. I've made this many times with chicken, beef and pork, with and without worcestershire, and it always turns out great.  I like wishbone Italian for it but have used many others. it's always good. I've gone without brown sugar if I don't have any. but I go just by the recipe if I can. it's always great and there are rarely leftovers. even my picky mother in law asked for the recipe. I make adjustments but I find it annoying when people review about how great they made it their way.  like, yes it could be better with homemade everything but not all people have time and money for homemade bbq,etc. oh, I use sweet baby rays original but have tried others. our family leans to sweet sauce. the dressing reAlly cuts the sweet so it isn't sickening, unless you have sugar issues. thank you for this great recipe that mAkes a regular Joe like me look like a great cook!

First time making and I followed the recipe and it turned out great with just a few minor changes  I added based on other reviews.  I agree with another reviewer stay away from cheap sauces.   I used a combination of  Jack Daniels and Famous Daves in mine.  Everyone loved it and have asked to have it again.  I cooked on low in the crock pot for 6 hours and then took out and shred the chicken (draining some of the liquid).  Then put it back in with more sauce for another 3 hours (both times on low).   Seasoned to taste with salt/pepper and some garlic (I would have added some onions but I have someone allergic to onions so didn't).  Saved some sauce for serving time (heated it up) for those that like a lot of sauce to add to their sandwich or plate serving.   Delicious and I have been asked to make it again for home as well as to bring to a neighborhood party.  Thank you for the recipe!

This was delicious! I took a few tips from other reviews and used fresh chicken breast (sprinkled it with salt, pepper, and garlic powder) and let it cook in the chicken broth for 3 hours on high. Then I drained the chicken broth, mixed the sauces, and cooked on low for one more hour. I'm making this again to feed our guests at our daughter's birthday party. It's such an easy meal to make!

Simply amazing recipe! I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce, threw in 4 cloves of garlic, and served it with baked potatoes and corn on the cob.  I served the chicken with lightly toasted Kaiser rolls, and it was def. a hit. I will be making this again.

This is the best pulled chicken / pork recipe for a crock pot.
Turned out awesome!

Here a just a couple 'tweaks' I made:

-I'm with everyone who doesn't cook frozen meat in slow cooker; I had 6 small fresh chicken breasts which totaled about 2-3 lbs. 
-Cooked the chicken breasts in about 3/4 cup of organic chicken broth on low for 3 hours. Separated chicken from broth, threw out broth and then fork split and returned to crock pot. During prep of chicken breasts I added salt, pepper, garlic powder and Italian seasoning (roughly 1 tsp each) to broth / chicken.
-Once chicken was cooked and split I added about 14 oz of Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ sauce, Drew's all natural Italian dressing,  3/4 cup brown sugar, wors. sauce  and set on low for about an hour. 
-Since the chicken was already cooked I then turned down to warm for remainder of day.

It's off the hook.....

I like sweet bbq, many don't, but you could use any smoked, mesquite, etc... sauce. Won't be bad - promise!

Really, really good.  Used sweet baby rays BBQ sauce.  Cooked the chicken in broth on high heat from thawed state for  2 - 3 hours...until it was easily shredded with a fork.  Dumped broth.  Added chicken back to crock along with other ingredients and cooked on low for a couple more hours.  Definitely a keeper!

I took the advice of other reviewers and used fresh thawed chicken breasts. I chose to cook on low, and two hours before completion I removed the breasts from the crockpot and shredded them, then return the meat to finish cooking while soaking up the flavor from the juices . After cooking was done  I strained the meat, returned the chicken to the crockpot, and added my desired amount of Sweet baby Ray's barbecue sauce. Closed the crockpot and let it warm up for a half an hour. We toasted buns in the oven and enjoyed this meal with a pan of cornbread. My family found it to be absolutely delicious and requested I save this recipe and make it again.

Made this yesterday and it was a hit with the family. My dad never has seconds, he asked for more and told me it was really good. He doesn't hand out compliments on many meals so this one gets a star in on my meal list! This was very easy and I followed the recipe exactly, used Sweet Baby Ray's barbecue sauce and Kraft zesty Italian dressing. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious!  I made this exactly how the recipe states. I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and Olive Garden Italian Salad Dressing both from Costco.  In the middle of cooking, I shredded the chicken and it made the chicken even more flavorful.  We ate it on hamburger buns and it was just perfect!

Extremely easy to make and the chicken stayed so moist! As someone who had never made "pulled" anything, I was stunned how the meat just fell off and I barely had to do anything! The only negative I'd say is that it isn't very "zesty," it's very sweet. That could be from the Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce I used, or from the brown sugar, but there was no zest to this at all. May try again with a spicier sauce. Otherwise, a great - and easy - dish! Put it on some rolls and the whole family loved it!

I prepared this for my 3 men on a football Sunday. I rinsed my chicken and seasoned with garlic powder, salt, ground pepper and added half a chopped onion. Afterwards I followed the recipe as is. I used my fave Jack Daniel's BBQ sauce. I served on buns with corn on the cobb home style chips. #perfecto #bighit

This was pretty good! And it was also easy to make, which is always a plus. I used three (fresh, not frozen) chicken breasts and I cut each of them horizontally, resulting in 6 pieces and seasoned them with my usual mixture of (season salt, garlic powder, onion powder, and pepper). I used Jack Daniels Honey BBQ sauce, WishBone Italian dressing, and also added some diced onions. Will definitely make again.

I don't think it needed more than a pinch of sugar, but otherwise is the easiest recipe for home BBQ. I used fresh, not frozen chicken.

Good and easy. I agree with those who say the BBQ sauce you use makes a ton of difference. Use a top quality BBQ sauce, sweet or spicy, whichever you prefer. I used Famous Dave's. 
And to those who say "the sauce was burned and the chicken was all dried out," that is impossible if you keep the cover on for the entire cooking time, which is the cardinal rule of crockpot cooking. A little liquid to start in any crockpot recipe and the crockpot will make its own moisture while cooking and nothing will ever dry out, even on High. But I prefer cooking everything on Low. Just  KEEP THE COVER ON! (No peeking even)
That way for me in my crockpot, this recipe worked great at 6 hours on Low. Lots of moisture (needed to be drained at end), and very Tasty!

This recipe was so good.  I loved how easy it was.  I only used 3 large boneless chicken breasts since there are 3 people in my family.  I added some crushed garlic and reduced the other ingredients by half.   I took another reviewers advice and brushed olive oil and garlic on the rolls before lightly toasting them under my broiler. I served the pulled chicken sandwiches with pickles and chips.  I even had plenty left over for everyone to have another sandwich the next day. The family loved it.  I'll be making this time saving recipe again and again.

Delish! Followed the recipe exactly. Cooked frozen breasts on high 4 hours. I did  drain and shred the chicken after 4 hours and cooked on low for 1 hour to blend the flavor throughout and it was so good. Great flavor. Needs no changes. Will definitely make it again. I used a Kraft "special edition" BBQ sauce which had a nice smokey flavor. Would never know that there was Italian salad dressing in it. Sauce was sweet but not overly sweet.

I made this for dinner the other night and it turned out delicious!  Cooked in slow cooker on low for 8+ hours.   By the time I shredded it, the meat was so tender and flavorful.  I did not need to add any additional sauce the the sauce was the right consistency.  Had leftovers for lunch the next day and it tasted even better!  Will definitely be making this again.

It was pretty good! I used a bottle of Famous Dave's Sweet n Zesty BBQ sauce and it was a hit. Put it on High in the slowcooker for about 4 hours, then let it sit until I got home from work. Nice and tender.

This is very simple, quick and delicious. I made this for my fiance. I put the chicken in the crockpot and mixed all the ingredients in a mixing bowl. I then poured all the ingredients on the chicken. About 45 minutes before the chicken was done I mixed some more of the ingredients in the bowl again. I toasted my hoagie buns with olive oil and served the sandwhiches with onions, tomatoes and cheese. He loved it. I cant wait to make it again...

I made this for dinner yesterday and my boyfriend and I enjoyed it a lot. I appreciate reviews from people that are only cooking for two, so I figured I would share my experience.

I halved the recipe(for 3 people just in case we wanted more) as I didn't need enough to feed 6 people. The alterations were fine. I did need to add a little more BBQ sauce than what the recipe called for, but that's it. I'm pretty sure the end product wouldn't have been tender enough otherwise. I used Baby Rays BBQ sauce and the chicken turned out delicious. 

I used frozen chicken and cooked everything on high for about 4 hours. That was perfect. A tip for anyone that wants an easier way of shredding chicken: Take out the chicken and use a mixer to shred it. I read that somewhere and have done it ever since. Such an easy and usually fast way to get shredded chicken!

I was worried that the sauce was too watery but once I shredded the chicken, it made the sauce thicken up a great deal.

You can definitely make alterations to fit your personal taste, but I think this recipe is spot on as is. All it needed was a little more sauce, but I don't really consider that altering the recipe.

I made this recipe for a potluck at work and it was a success! 
I made a few modifications to the recipe:

1. I used boneless skinless chicken thighs that I had on hand and trimmed as much excess fat as possible.
2. Because I wanted to ensure that the chicken would be fully cooked without potentially burning it if I left it to cook overnight to be ready in time for our early lunch the next day, I prepped the ingredients the night before----I seasoned the chicken thighs with Stubs barbecue rub and baked at 425F for about 40 minutes(or until fully cooked). Once the chicken was done, I drained off most of the liquid, shredded the meat (while removing any remaining excess fat) and placed it aside.
3. I finely sliced and caramelized one medium red onion and added it to the sauce recipe. I also added a dash of cayenne pepper and crushed red pepper flakes (to taste) for a touch of heat. I used Ken's Zesty Italian Dressing and Stubs Spicy barbecue sauce. I combined all of the sauce ingredients with the cooked shredded chicken and put it into the fridge overnight.
4. The next morning when I arrived at work,  I dumped the container of chicken/sauce into my slow cooker and let it cook on high for 2.5 hours and low for 1 hour so that it would be hot and ready to serve at lunch time-- It turned out extremely well and I would definitely make it again!

My overall recommendation would definitely be to use your favorite ingredients.

Cooked thawed chicken breasts on low for 3 hours. Shredded, stirred, and added one onion thinly sliced. Cooked on low for an additional hour.

So easy and amazing. Only mods I made were to use Stubb's Spicy BBQ, a few sprinkles of Tony's, and to shred it and put it back in for an hour after 5.5 hours on low.

Instead of sandwiches, I made comfort food bowls by layering mashed potatoes, corn and this chicken.  A little of the chicken  sauce topped it off!  A keeper for a quick throw together in the morning and assembly in the evening!

I added about 1/2 cup of Bragg Raw Apple Cider Vinegar to give it a little healthy zing in addition to another cook's idea to add chicken broth, garlic, and pepper.  I'm not a huge fan of very sweet bbq sauces, and adding the broth and vinegar helped make it taste a little less sweet without sacrificing any flavor. It also didn't taste like someone just dumped a jar of sauce on shredded chicken.  I thickened this sauce after the chicken was cooked and shredded, and put the chicken back in it.  Everyone loved it! If I wasn't making this for kids, I think it would be amazing to give it a little kick by using a good quality spicy bbq sauce w/o HFCS. Kinder's or Trader Joe's Sriracha BBQ sauce are fantastic. I think they're organic, too, which is a plus.

I had no chicken on hand so I used boneless pork chops I had in the freezer. I defrosted the pork chops and cooked them in a pan for a tad with garlic powder on each side. I followed the rest exactly as recipe called for. It was a big hit! I will be making this again. Thank you for the recipe

Used Hak's Chipotle Bourbon BBQ sauce and followed the recipe otherwise, although I did add a small knob of butter to the pot after shredding the chicken.  Served on toasted bakery buns with baked potatoes and sweet corn.  The family loved it and I've vacuum sealed the leftovers for another meal!

I can't believe I finally found an easy to prepare crockpot meal my three kids all love. They ALL thought the house smelled good when they walked in from school, and they each ate an entire sandwich! I followed the recipe, except I used only 4 chicken breasts, because I was so sure one of them would hate it. Not only did they all like it, they ate the leftovers without complaint the next night!!!!  Thank you for this recipe. I used Sweet Baby Rays original BBQ sauce.

I didn't realize my italian dressing was expired, so I frantically looked for another solution and decided on the chicken broth. I added salt, pepper, and a touch of garlic powder per the user review. I think I might take out the garlic powder next time, but for 2 chicken breasts (6 was too much for my family), an 18 oz bottle and half a small can of chicken stock was sufficient. Its good! It wasn't great, but I think we will be making this again. Honestly, I don't see how italian dressing would add anything to this meal. As long as you are using the good BBQ sauce you shouldn't need anything  else.

This was so good and very easy. I followed the recipe exactly. Cooked on high for 3 hours then shredded and cooked on low 1 more hour. Will be making this again soon!

This is now my new replacement for pulled pork. Added mushrooms, white onion, red pepper, a couple hot cherry peppers and a few cloves of garlic. Used sweet baby rays and my own concoction of italian dressing. Needless to say, cooked on high one hour and low for 3 or 4 more and it was perfect. Cooked the chicken first though, I'm not positive if it'll be fully cooked if you throw in raw.

This is a pretty decadent recipe, lots of sugar and lots of fat. It was a little too sweet for my taste, even with reducing the sugar to .2 cup. It seems strange to put salad dressing in a BBQ dish, but it makes a lot of sense. Chicken breasts are incredibly lean, but adding the dressing adds a bunch of fat, making this dish as succulent as pulled pork. I also added a few pinches of salt and crystal hot sauce to tame the sweetness a bit. Overall a delicious, if diet busting dish.

I will definitely make this again and again! I used Sweet Baby Rays Original BBQ Sauce, since theirs is delicious and their first restaurant is in my home town. 

I didn't change much else and I didn't cut my chicken in halves before putting it in. I also cooked mine on low for about 9-10 hours, without any high for an hour or what not, still turned out delicious! I live by myself and this has PLENTY of leftovers!

Absolutely delicious!!! Only thing I did differently was add a conservative amount of red pepper flakes. Was a bit watery, but after shredding the chicken and letting it cook for an additional 45 minutes, it was a better consistency. The taste was phenomenal using Jack Daniels bbq sauce. I put the pulled chicken, topped with coleslaw on toasted ciabatta rolls. Will definitely make this again. Thx for the recipe.

Good recipe. Just keep in mind that Famous Daves, Jack Daniels and most all the grocery store BBQ sauces are sweetened w/ HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP. So far I've found TJ's BBQ sauce to be a good sauce w/o the HFCS...it's sweetened w/ sugar. I'm still looking for other NON HFCS BBQ sauces.

This was sooooo delicious!!!!! Definitely making it again, as often as I can! Cooked it on low, then pulled the chicken apart after 3 hours, then let it cook 2 more hours. I used Guy Fieri's Kansas City BBQ sauce, and made Italian dressing using the Good Seasons mix. Make this, you will not be sorry.

Oh my, how delicious! I did not have Italian salad dressing so used what I had, Raspberry Vinagrette! I love that you start with frozen meat. Cooked it on high setting. Did great. Thought there was way too much liquid at the end but by the time I shredded the chicken and tossed it back in the sauce it was perfect!

We had this at my daughter's house for Independence Day 2015 and it was delicious! She always keeps frozen chicken breasts in her freezer and she got them out last minute to feed a crowd. The sauce is delicious and everyone wanted the recipe. This takes no time at all to finish up by shredding the chicken at it doesn't heat up the house on a hot summer day! We will be making this again and again. I wouldn't change a single thing in this recipe!

I wish there were tips posted for newbies because the recipe as is tasted like soy sauce chicken by the time the food was done. Not very pleasant but I rated it 3 stars because I'm sure it'll taste better once I figure out what to do with the sauce.

This recipe is the best! I wasn't sure about the Italian dressing but I decided to try it since it already had great reviews.  My family and I love this and they are so happy when I tell them this is what's for dinner!

The best bbq pulled chicken I've ever had. My family loved it and always wants me to make more. I made this recipe exactly the way they wanted and used Diana honey garlic sauce as my added sauce. With a little franks hot sauce and some galic and oil toasted kaiser buns, it turned out amazing.

I love making this! It's so simple but so good! I've found that Kraft zesty Italian dressing and sweet baby rays bbq sauce make it sweet but a little tangy. I usually double the recipe to make for more people, it's great for parties!

Made this a while ago and i really don't have any worthwhile criticisms of this dish. Served it on some buns with spicy shredded cheese and it was a hit in our place. Definately going to do this again, possibly with some crushed dried peppers in the mix.

Made this last night. It is delicious and I'm looking forward to having leftovers for lunch.

I took various recommendations from the reviews, including using liquid smoke. I did NOT have a problem with watery sauce and I only used 3 chicken breasts and kept all other portions equal to the original recipe.

I got home from the grocery and realized I had FORGOTTEN the Italian dressing. I had no dressing in the entire house, but I remembered that another reviewer had used a balsamic vinaigrette in replace of Italian, so what I did was grab a bottle of balsamic vinegar and a bottle of olive oil and splashed them in. (I didn't measure, but I eyeballed it to be about 2 tablespoons of each.)

Everyone seems to really enjoy the Famous Dave's Rich & Sassy BBQ, so that's what I used. I added about 2 cloves of minced garlic and some Montreal chicken seasoning. I cooked on high for 4 hours, shredded and let sit for another 20 minutes, and served on onion buns with red onion and sliced Claussen pickles. WONDERFUL!

Although I made a lot of changes, I really think the recipe would have been just great without. (I don't think I would make it without the liquid smoke, though.)

My fiance said this came out too dry. I thought it was pretty bland, it didn't absorb as much flavor as I'd hoped it would. It was really easy to make and it made decent sandwiches, but I think the recipe would require a lot of doctoring before we could call it great!

This was amazing! I was a bit skeptical at first, but after reading some reviews I decided to cook it on low for 4 hrs, shred the chicken and then let it go another hour. It was fantastic! I'll definitely be making this again.

Excellent recipe. The chicken was juicy and flavorful. I cooked the chicken (3 pieces) on high for 3 hours, shredded the chicken, and then on low for 45 minutes. The only think I would change next time would be to use 3/4 of the amount of sauce called for but only because I used less chicken.

I didn't use enough chicken (I was confused what counted as "halves"- doh!), so this was heavy on the sauce and overall tasted a bit too sweet.  In the future, I would either use less BBQ sauce or more chicken to soak it up.  Overall a tasty dish, maybe not  the healthiest.

My boyfriend and I LOVE this recipe! It's super easy to make for a small or large crowd. Definitely use 1/2 the amount of suggested chicken breasts (I used 3 instead of 6). An hour before turning the slow cooker off, shred the chicken. This will ensure that all the sauce will get soaked up- yum! And when reheating, make sure to put a moist towel over the chicken so it stays moist and the sauce does not burn.

My boyfriend likes eating this on a soft toasted roll will melted sharp cheddar cheese. I like it without the cheese.

Thank you Suzanne for the recipe!!!

I wouldn't have thought I would like the Italian dressing mixed in. But this is as tasty as it gets. Very simple to make. I did add a little garlic and a taste of salt. I too used sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce.

This was awesome! Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ works best but I held off on the brown sugar as the BBQ sauce is already sweet. Best slow cooker recipe to date!

Great recipe. I use fresh chicken breast and cook on high for 3 hours and low for 1 hour like some have suggested on here. Turned out wonderfully! I recommend using your favorite BBQ sauce that has a bit of a kick. I have fun with the recipe and add different spices to give it the kick that I want. I recommend experimenting and making it your own!

This is a great recipe! I used sweet baby rays BBQ sauce and it's amazing! Only used 3 frozen chicken breast and it only need to cook on low for 4 hours, after that the chicken was falling apart. This recipe could not be easier! Thank you for sharing!

I tried this recipe exactly as is, but with 4 chicken breasts instead of 6.  it came out delicious and moist. This is now one of my go to slow cooker meals. I put it on a bun for a sandwich and serve it with fries, Macaroni and cheese or coleslaw.

This is restaurant quality BBQ and it was a big hit during the Super Bowl. Could not have had a better meal during the game. 

The only differences to the recipe I made were the following: I used thawed chicken, and I sauteed chopped onions (half an onion) before adding them to the crock pot, and I also added 4 cloves of pressed garlic to the sauce. I used Jack Daniel's Honey Smokehouse BBQ sauce. Cooked on low 4 hours,  then removed chicken to pull it, added it back and cooked on low for another hour. Added about 1 tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken, since sauce was slightly more watery than I liked - but it thickened up very nicely during the last hour.

Delicious and will definitely be making this recipe again in the future. It also could not have been easier.

I also used fresh chicken breast and it turned out perfect!! I actually added some more BBQ sauce at the end of cooking because the shredded breast did absorb the as use well.

Edited to bump up a star. Have made 3 or 4 times now, most recently with boneless skinless thighs to pump up the flavor and that was the best this recipe has come out. I also think I had a larger sauce to meat ratio this time which kept it moist. I put it on while at work which means it sat for 10 hours on low (what can ya do) and it was basically boiling away when I got home and had some burnt bits but I scooped those out and it still tasted amazing. I was worried it was too liquidy but I stirred it up and shredded the chicken, turned it to warm and let it sit for 15-30 min and it was great! I use Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory Brown Sugar sauce and with the additional brown sugar in the recipe it's quite sweet so you could maybe reduce the brown sugar added.

I tried this recipe earlier this week and it was fantastic. Not too sweet at all. Yesterday, I made another batch and added a few pineapple chunks. I let my neighbor try some and he said that it was "awesome".

Very, very tasty! I sped things up by microwaving the chicken beasts then shred the beasts with a mixer. Then placed in crock pot with sauce over it. Only took about 1.5 to 2 hrs to be perfect!

Recipe doesn't say if chicken is to remain frozen or not so I left it frozen and the sauce turned out to be to watery. Looked more like soup then something to put on a bun. Had decent flavor though.

I made these last night and used fresh chicken because I had just gotten back from the grocery store. I left out the sugar because the sauce I was using was already pretty sweet. It turned out great! I cooked it on high for 3 hours, shredded it, and put it back in the sauce for a bit to really soak up the flavor. Put these on slider buns and it was a huge hit with my husband and sister-in-law. Definitely a keeper.

Delicious! Made it with tenderloins and Hickory flavored Open Pit BBQ sauce, and I 100% over ate because it was fantastic! Broiled kaiser rolls and it was lights out for me! Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Seriously delicious! I was very surprised at how much I liked this. I used Tuscan Italian dressing as it was what I had on hand and I think this could have added an extra bit of "zest". Thanks for a great super quick recipe!

Awesome and easy. My chicken didn't thaw all the way but I put them in frozen and they turned out great. I even added a little beer for some kick. I may try some hot sauce or pepper to make it a little spicy next time.

Definitely a great recipe for a quick dinner. I put the chicken in the cooker at 1030 am and was eating dinner by 430 pm! A big hit with the hubby too, who is very picky about BBQ :-)

It was very good. Our whole family enjoyed it, even my picky eater. Followed the recipe as written, I don't believe in reviewing a recipe if I had made changes. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was very simple and the chicken came out great. I used  Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce. We ate it on hamburger buns with fries. My family loved it.

This was so easy and so delicious. I'm in law school and have no time for cooking. This took less time and energy than take-out and it tasted better and is probably better for me.  Highly recommend.

We loved this recipe, it was a hit with everyone! And it's so easy & convenient to have supper cooking when the football game is on in the afternoon :) The only thing I did differently was to add garlic. I might like to add a half an onion, chopped, next time. We will definitely have this again!

So I tried this recipe out and my god was it good. It was only for myself so did 2 frozen chicken breasts, good BBQ sauce and light brown sugar... Didn't have Worcester sauce or salad dressing. 1 hour 20 minutes total time was perfect for it given reduced number of chicken breasts. Only needed a little sugar as the BBQ sauce had a decent amount in it already. Great recipe for when the lads come round!

This is a really easy recipe.  You throw the ingredients in the crock pot and that's it.  It's really good.  We serve it with baked beans and coleslaw.  Easy week night meal for the family.

We loved this BBQ Chicken. It was even better the 2nd day ( and dare I say 3rd!). The roll really helps balance the sweet/spicy (I added extra cayenne pepper). Will make again on chilly fall day! Thanks for recipe!

I have made this twice so far using Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce. Once to the letter, save for fresh chicken,was too sweet for boyfriend and I so I eliminated the sugar the second time and served to visiting family and it was a huge hit! 
My favorite thing to do with the leftovers is make a BBQ Chicken pizza using more Sweet Baby Ray's for sauce and cheddar cheese.

I have made this recipe three times now, and it's awesome every time! I don't change a thing, except the last couple times I doubled it (it freezes well). I always serve over sweet potatoes with red onions and green pepper.

My husband loves this recipe! I don't eat chicken but can't wait to try it with pork. It's very easy to make which is a bonus for me, in addition to having so much left over to freeze for another night.

Have made this multiple times.  So easy, makes an ample amount. There are only two of us, so I freeze in smaller portions using my food saver.  Great for quick fixes.

Very easy and quick. I love that I can throw the chicken in frozen. I made this exactly as written. My husband even liked it even though he thinks it's a crime to eat chicken any way other than fried.

This was so good my son took some and put it on a roll and had it for lunch at work.  I didn't have Italian dressing so I used Greek dressing, the pot just about emptied in one day, definitely a keeper.

My family loved this. When they're done cooking, I took the chicken out and shredded them with a fork then returned it back to the sauce to cook longer. You need to use thick buns or rolls! The next night we used the leftovers to put on top of baked potatoes which were very tasty also.

Love it as-is. As everyone is saying, you definitely need good BBQ sauce--don't skimp. (I use Jack Danie's). I use frozen and have never had an issue.

Excellent recipe.  I followed all the directions except, since I was out of Italian Dressing (I know, who runs out of Italian dressing), I instead used Newman's Own Balsam Vinegar and Oil.  I set my cooker to low and when I was able to shred the chicken I turned it down to low and let it set in the sauce for a while.  For my barbecue sauce I used Bone Sucking Sauce.

I used half a bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's Sweet & Spicy BBQ sauce and half a bottle of KC Masterpiece's Hickory Brown Sugar BBQ sauce along with the Italian dressing/Worcestershire sauce.  I also used 6 frozen chicken breasts and cooked on low for 7 1/2 hours, shredded it up, and left it on warm for another 30 mins.  Everything meshed together very well and had enough left overs for 2 nights.. and it was devoured!

Absolutely fabulous!! I have to say that this recipe turned out great for me as my most pickiest eater LOVE it had seconds. She pretty much licked the plate clean. I did revise it a little bit by only adding half the barbecue sauce in the beginning and then about 30 minutes before it was done, I added the rest and I only shredded half the chicken and left the other. All in all it was a hit in my home and I will make it again and again!

Just tried this recipe with 6 frozen chicken breasts one bottle of jack Daniel's barbeque and about a half cup of honey mustard. I didn't have Worcestershire so I added a table spoon of soy sauce and a table spoon of rice vinegar. Cooked it for 4 hours on high after about 3 hours I shredded the chicken to make sure the chicken absorbed all the delicious liquid. I wish I had the Italian dressing to add to this but I was out unfortunately.

I substituted Italian dressing with Sweet Balsamic Vinaigrette dressing, added an onion, and I also slowly added a little corn starch when it was almost done to thicken it up (otherwise it would've been too runny).  Served on Ciabatta bread.  Absolutely wonderful!

This is delicious. We usually only make 1/2 the servings, and always add a tablespoon of brandy and a tablespoon of sriracha. Serve on potato buns with fresh kale and raw onion and my boyfriend literally is eating the leftover sauce in the slow cooker with a spoon. Always shred the chicken an hour before serving and put it back in the slow cooker to absorb as much sauce as possible.

This was good, I added some minced garlic,onions and 1/4 tsp of poultry seasoning with chicken legs I used (pulled the skin off them). They were so tender after 4 hours I shredded the meat of the bones and let it sit in the slow cooker until we were ready to eat.Adding to recipe box so I can make regularly...especially when I am in a quick and effortless dinner:)

Making this for dinner tonight and it's actually still in the slow cooker. Absolutely delish!!!! I used fresh chicken breast not frozen and seasoned it with salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder and added a teaspoon of liquid smoke otherwise Followed the recipe exactly. I used Famous Dave's Rich & Sassy BBQ sauce and Kraft Tuscan House Italian Dressing. I cooked it on low for 6 hours and shredded the chicken just an hour before it was ready. It absorbed the sauce perfectly, I took a little bite to taste and can't wait until my husband gets home so I can have more!! Planning to eat it in a French roll kind of like the picture in the recipe with a small salad.

This was delicious! I slightly modified it though to suit my family's taste. I added an half a teaspoon of cumin, half a red onion - minced, and a tablespoon of powdered chicken bouillon. I also made a Carolina vinegar coleslaw to top the sliders. It was divine!

Excellent recipe!  Easy to prepare with basic ingredients.  I added a dash of liquid smoke that added to the flavor.  My husband loved it and my toddler ate it up!  This will become a regular recipe in our house now!

I use Jack Daniels bbq sauce and I think that makes a big difference in your outcome (a quality sauce).  Making it today to take to friends...don't be afraid to try it.  You will love it - so easy!

I am not a huge bqq sauce person but my husband is and I thought this recipe might be a little to simple and ordinary for him but he LOVED it and believe me he does not compliment my cooking hardly ever so for him to rave about this recipe means it is that good! He had me make a batch for him to take into his work for a pot luck meal, he was that impressed! It has become a family favorite for sure.

Fantastic. I served my Pokeno group and they ate it all. I used Masterpiece Barbeque Sauce and added a tablespoon of honest. I thawed and washed the chicken breasts before cooking for 4 hours on slow. Turned down the crock pot to warm, shredded the chicken and returned the meat to the crock pot. Easy to prepare and delicious.

Tried this last night, and it was quite tasty. I was a little watery, but I made an open faced sandwhich from it, so the bun ended up sucking up the extra sauce, and with a fork, it was quite managable.  Added onion to it (because we love onion) and it was very delicious. Will make this again!

I've made this recipe a hundred times over and it's always a hit!  So incredibly easy yet delicious!  I've switched from making this in the slow cooker to my instant pot. Now it's even faster, but just as delicious!  I add all ingredients into the instant pot and cook on non venting, high pressure for 25 minutes.  I let it naturally release for about 10 minutes and then open it up. Shred it right in the pot!

Loved this!  Easy to make.  I gleaned from others' suggestions-- I cooked fresh, seasoned (whatever you like-- salt/ pepper/ garlic/ onion pwdr), chicken breasts on high or 2 1/2 hrs with chicken broth, threw in a chopped up onion.  Drained it, kept chicken & onions, shredded chicken, put back in slow cooker on high for an hour with homemade bbq sauce (rachel ray's smoky bbq sauce) and the other ingredients in this recipe.  

Served on buns with melted white cheddar & california slaw (from this site).

Yum!!

A family favorite! I always get the best results when I use a "better brand" rather than store brand BBQ sauce. Is one of those meals that is awesome for left overs as well.

This is so delicious! I didn't have brown sugar so I used white sugar and also left out the Worcestershire sauce because I didn't have any and it was delicious! I used frozen chicken breasts and cooked on low for 6 hours and they were super soft and moist! A Huge hit with the hubby! Thank you!

I am really impressed with a)how easy this was to make, and b)how GOOD it turned out.  Gotta love a recipe that gives you a great return on investment ;)  I actually used a thawed 1 lb turkey breast, with "Diana" bbq sauce, and balsamic vinaigrette for 3 hours on high.  Only regret was that I didn't make coleslaw with it.  Can't wait to try it again, especially since I ate it all before my hubby got any!!!

Great recipe! I used fresh chicken breasts instead of frozen, i added everything it calls for, but i also threw in 1tsp liquid smoke, salt tt, garlic powder tt, and pepper tt. I used sweet baby rays original bbq sauce and it came out perfect! I cooked it on high for 3.3 hours and once it was done i used my hand mixer to just shred it right in the pot! Will def make again!

I love when I find a recipe like this. I followed exactly and it was fantastic. I wouldn't change a thing. There was a lot of juice so maybe I'd add another breast or 2 but that's it. It was sweet yet tangy, messy to eat kind of like a sloppy joe. Seriously a recipe that's simple, tastes amazing, and cheap!

This recipe is a hit in my household. The only thing I did different was replaced the bun with fresh coleslaw mix without the dressing and ate it that way for a healthy mix.

Made this recipe today. I used 3 frozen chicken breasts and did not cut them in half. Just threw them in right from the freezer. Used all ingredients, with slightly more Italian dressing than the recipe called for. It was delicious!! Even my 3 year old said, "mom, this is delicious. This is the best BBQ chicken EVER"!  Just can't beat that :-)

I followed what other reviewers said and shredded the chicken an hour or so before it was done. This really helps the flavor. I also chopped up onion and garlic which smells delicious! My boyfriend and I have made this at least 3 times since I found the recipe. We love love love it!!

I made this today and it turned out GREAT! I used 3 large, fresh chicken breast and cut each in half. I took the suggestions of several reviews and used a molasses based BBQ sauce, added 1 1/2 tsp of minced garlic, a tsp of liquid smoke, and seasoned the chicken with a little salt and pepper before adding the sauce. I cooked it on high for 3 hours, shredded the chicken, added it back to the pot and cooked for an additional hour on low. On a bun with a slice of cheddar, red onion, an pickles.... PERFECTION.

I used this recipe as a "base" idea and made a few tweaks! I omitted the Italian dressing and added about 1/4 cup of Tapatio for some kick! I also added more Worcestershire sauce than the recipe calls for and threw in a diced onion and diced garlic. I cooked it for 4hrs on high, then shredded the chicken and cooked it on low for another hour and a half, stirring occasionally and removing the lid for the last half hour(because it wasn't thickening quick enough for me!). I served it on Texas toast with blue cheese crumbles and it was amazing!!

Great weeknight recipe with lots of leftover options! I cooked the frozen chicken breasts on low all day in 2C. chicken broth with pressed garlic & cracked pepper. I then skimmed off most of the fat & liquid at the 7th hour & shredded the chicken. I then added the sauce mixture I had reserved in the fridge & allowed chicken to cook on high for the final hour. I think the broth made the chicken tender & flavorful, the skimming of the fat & liquid made it less watery, the addition of the sauce in the final hour made it saucy & richer! The chicken made great quesadilla's the next night!

I reduced the recipe for just one person (one breast and so on) and it cooked in 3 hours on low.  This pic is just one breast! I added a splash of liquid smoke and some granulated onion.  It was really delicious!

We loved the recipe! I took mine a step further and boiled the chicken in chicken broth for about a half hour. As for the barbecue sauce, I used Sticky Fingers brand and it was amazing. The meat fell apart after 3 hrs on high. PERFECT!

I am a vegetarian, but I jokingly told my family that this smelled good enough to make me eat meat again! Everyone loved this recipe! I made it exactly as written except that I shredded the meat about an hour before it was ready to be served. Served with garlic mashed potatoes and broccoli. 3 people at TEN sandwiches.  Leftovers? Ha! Not at all.

I have three very picky teen-aged boys and all three LOVED this! I  used 2 1/2 lbs. of frozen chicken:  1 1/2 lbs of thighs and 1 1/2 lbs of breasts and one bottle of Jack Daniels Barbecue sauce.  I put everything in the crock-pot at lunchtime, then around 5:00 I shredded the chicken with a fork.  At that time, I added 1/2 cup Olive Garden Italian dressing, 4 Tbs Kroger brand Worcestershire sauce, 3/4 C dark brown sugar backed, and 3/4 cup of barbecue sauce (I used Kroger Thick & Spicy because I ran out of JD.) I could have let some of the liquid cook out of it, but chose instead to serve the BBQ open faced over buns/bread. The next time I make this I will probably drain the chicken and then add another whole bottle of BBQ sauce with the other ingredients.  Even though this means I will be draining off a lot of the sauce I added in the beginning, it will still have served as a marinade during the cooking.  I may also try a sauce that has a bit more of a kick as this was more sweet than "zesty".  I'll definitely make this again, and will probably even make it for a dish to take to work, a family event, etc.

I have added a few things and made it pop. I make when we have many people over and they rant and rave about it every time.  I add a 1/2 cup captain morgan spiced rum, 1/4 cup grape jelly, and 2 Tablespoons cayenne pepper. It gives it a nice sweet and spicy flavor. And the best bbq sauce I found is sweet baby rays

Pretty much followed the recipe as is, however, I only had 2 breasts so I combined them with 5 thighs, all frozen. I also ran out of Worcesteshire sauce so I didn't use it. I added sliced onions to the bottom, before adding the chicken, and topped it with several cloves of garlic. The whole family loved it, including my picky 6 year old. We slow cooked it for 4 hours on high, shredded the chicken, then cooked it for another 45 minutes or so. We ate it in hamburger buns topped with cole slaw and cheese. Yummy and the family stuffed themselves! Thank you!!

I didn't have all the ingredients so I improvised. 2 frozen turkey breasts, balsamic vinaigrette, 1/2 bottle of BBQ sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and 2 teaspoons chopped garlic. Ready in 4 hours, delicious. Served with baked sweet potato fries spiced with fajita mix.

I used a can of chicken broth and put the chicken in the crockpot, with salt and pepper, all day, on low, for eight hours. Once I got home, I drained the broth, shredded the chicken, added the remaining ingredients, and continued on low for another hour. I used Jack Daniels sauce. This turned out really good. I sautéed green pepper and onion, broiled the buns, and melted cheddar. Next time I will add onion and green pepper in the morning with the chicken.

This is the first recipe my 8 year old loved!  Great as is.  I used 3 frozen chicken breasts and shredded them after 2 hours on high, continued cooking for another 2 hours in the sauce.  I made this with Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ and Wishbone Italian dressing.

I liked this recipe. It was so easy and had a video. One of the other reviewers was right. You need to have a really good bbq sauce. Nonetheless it was still very good. I found that I needed more than 120z. of bbq sauce though. Love it and good, easy, and simple slow cooker recipe.

I doubled this recipe, using defrosted chicken breasts.  Put a little less Worcestershire sauce in because it seemed a lot...cooked in the crockpot overnight on low, then shredded the meat.  The sauce was very watery, so I poured out a good amount of the liquid out and added a new mixture of bbq sauce, Worcestershire sauce, Italian dressing and brown sugar.  Put the sauce back in the crockpot with the shredded chicken and warmed it up, then served on hamburger buns with shredded lettuce and cheese slices.  Yum!!  Will definitely make again!

Loved this recipe with Sweet Baby Rays sauce and Wishbone Salad dressing from my pantry. Today is the 5th time that I've eaten some of the leftovers that I had frozen a month ago. Still licking my fork to have ever little bit of yumminess. This is definitely in my slow cooker Top 10 Ever recipes. Thank you Zane Tastic for the recipe.

Absolutely fantastic.  I had a party of 50+ people, used two crock pots divided evenly with this recipe -- one with a basic sweet bbq sauce and italian dressing, the other with a smoky chipotle bbq sauce and balsamic italian dressing (made with four seasons packets).  BOTH were fantastic - some of my guests were even convinced that the second recipe with the balsamic dressing was pork, not chicken.   I served this with hamburger buns, and everyone was thrilled.  Be aware that once the chicken is fully cooked, it looks a bit dry and the sauce is watery.  Don't be worried - as soon as you shred the chicken and return it to the pot, the chicken soaks up the sauce and it becomes just the right thickness.  In future, I plan to keep using the smoky sauce and balsamic dressing, but in general, you just can't go wrong with this recipe.

Yum!  I'm sure it depends on the bbq sauce.  I like the thick, sweet smokey sauce, so when all we had was a half bottle of vinegary sauce, I added extra brown sugar and some molasses - turned out great!  Definitely a keeper recipe!

I made this for a busy day and my family loved it. We're six people, so I doubled this and then shredded the meat to make pulled chicken sandwiches. I also used a sweet & spicy sauce and added some red pepper flakes to give it an extra kick. Very good, and I'll make it again.

This recipe is 4 stars as written and 5 stars with a little adjustment. I cooked the chicken breasts in chicken broth for 5 hours and then drained the broth, shredded the chicken, and then put it back in the pot for 2 more hours with the sauce. 

Thanks for the great recipe!

I can only imagine that this is even better than what I made - halfway through the recipe I realized I had only 1/4 cup of italian dressing and no worsterchire sauce. I replaced that with HP Fruity sauce. It all worked great!

I took the advice of another poster and cooked this for 6 hours on high in garlic, pepper, onions and 16 oz of chicken broth. I drained the broth and then poured in the other ingredients which I let cook on low for 2 hours. Delicious!

My kind of recipe....Easy but Good!!!  Made exactly to recipe using Michelbob's Original Championship BBQ Sauce, Kraft Tuscan House Italian 'Anything' Dressing and Low Sodium Worcestershire Sauce.  I do not like my BBQ dripping in sauce so I drained the extra and served it on the side for those who wanted to add more.  For dinner I topped it on a baked potato and then the next day served the leftovers as a sandwich.  Thanks Zanne for submitting a this!

Awesome! I love the tangy flavor. It didn't need 8 hours in my crock pot though, 4-5 should be enough. I start it off on high and then switch over to low after about an hour.

I used fresh cleaned chicken breats, seasoned them with salt, pepper and garlic powder. The only change in ingredients was a 16oz bottle  instead of 12oz of bbq sauce, I used Weber Grill original. Cooked on high around three hours, shredded 4 of the breasts added back to the pot & stirred, threw the two breats on top and cooked low for maybe 1/2 hour. Very easy, I got one sandwich and my picky other half ate the rest over 3 days. The 2 remaining breasts I shredded & put in a sauce pan, added Franks Red Hot Buffalo Wing Sauce till warm. I liked this better than the bbq and he won't touch this.

I used 6  chicken breasts that were not frozen because thats what i had.  I put them in the crockpot for 2 hrs on low. Then shredded chicken and let it cook for another hour on low. I used sweet baby rays bbq sauce so I omitted the brown suger since it is already so sweet.  Last, I thought the sauce was slightly thin once it was done so I added a little more BBQ sauce.  I like this because it tastes great and it's super easy and it didn't turn out dry for me

I love that you don't have to thaw the chicken - just throw it in the crock-pot frozen!  This a go-to recipe for me when I need something for company and don't have any time.  I usually serve it over rice. Yum!

I made this for a large party I was having and it was huge hit, everyone was asking for the recipe. I followed the direction (doubled) with exception of using fresh not frozen chicken. I made it the day before and then just heated it the crockpot and served.

4 1/2 hours on Low was enough. I did not have any Itialian Dressing on hand so I used a 16-18 oz bottle of BarBQ sauce and added a Tbls of liquid smoke like others suggested.  Perfect!

Easy to make and my family devoured it on fresh rolls. I followed to the recipe and kept it on low in the slow cooker. Delicious. This will be a summer staple with corn on the cob and cole slaw.

Easy to make, not too involved (ingredients). Great result. My mother and law and I wanted to have bbq, but had to be creative and figure out how to get bbq with out a grill. This slow cooked bbq chicken recipe blew our minds! Give a try - you will not be disappointed.

I didn't have the italian dressing on hand like I thought I did so I improvised that ingredient (some oil, italian seasoning, some vinegar). Even with my weirdo modifications this was really good! Plus incredibly easy and you can't beat easy!

Very good.  I didn't have any Italian salad dressing so I sprinkled some Italian herb blend in the mixture along with 1/4 cup of beer.   The bbq sauce that I used was a little sweet so next time I will try a different one.   I followed the suggestion of after 2 hours on high I removed the chicken, shredded it and returned it to cook another hour on low.  This was so easy and the results turned out very well.  Thanks for sharing.

Simple and oh, so good!  I poured the sauce over a 2.25lb London broil and ignored it for the next 8 hrs, on low of course.  No fuss, great meal and lots of left-overs for lunch!  How does it get better?

Very simple.  The flavor was a bit mild for me so I added crushed red pepper and garlic powder.  I also served it with extra BBQ sauce on the side.  It makes a huge portion too.

I love love love this recipe! The sauce is really good (I used Sweet Baby Ray's original), although I use 1/4 cup Italian dressing now (just my preference, it was still good with the full amount the recipe called for!). I did take some advice from reviewers, and used 3 fresh chicken breasts (a few times I've gotten chicken from the store right before making this, and they were partially frozen, and they still came out fine in the same time as fresh breasts). The reason I only used 3 is because I'm in college and I generally only cook for just myself, sometimes my boyfriend and friends. I cook them on 3 hours on high, and then shred the chicken and mixed the shredded chicken with the sauce well, then cook for another hour on low. I thought the sauce amount was perfect for 3 large breasts, I didn't have too much or too little for my personal tastes. Thank you so much for sharing your recipe :)

This was an excellent recipe, but as usually I did add some additional ingredients.  Cooked some diced onions and garlic to add to crock pot, added some hot sauce, and liquid smoke.  Yum. Got compliments from everyone.

Excellent!  We used fresh chicken and halved the sauce for 3 chicken breasts.  It was done after 5 hours on low, and had excellent flavor.  Will make again!

This was a great recipe. All 4 of my kids loved it as well as the adults. Even my daughter who is very picky asked for seconds.

I used 3 fresh chicken breasts, added about 1/4 cup of onions, one clove of garlic, kraft house italian, sweet baby rays honey chipolte bbq sauce and cooked it on high for 3 hours. I took the chicken out and shredded it, then cooked for another 45 minutes-hour. It was juicy and not too much liquid remained after I shredded the chicken.  My boyfriend absolutely loved it and asked me to definitely save the recipe!

I never use the brown sugar and it turns out absolutely AMAZING. I always add a bit of Valentina or Cholula hot sauce and use spicy BBQ sauce. Once it's done, I butter sourdough bread and put it on a non-stick pan, layer on the chicken, and melt Colby cheese and habanero cheese (spicy jack would also work) on top. I also put pickled jalapeno peppers and onion.

I made this recipe exactly as is, but used fresh chicken breasts. I also shredded the chicken when an hour remained and put it back into the sauce (as others on this site recommended). Served it hot on fresh rolls with cole slaw and sweet potato tater tots. The whole family loved it! I will definitely make this again. The flavor on the sauce was incredible and it was so easy!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe!  I made a few changes, because it was what I had on hand.  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs, and used a ranch dressing packet. It was delicious!!  I did use a tsp of flour an hour into cooking to make sure the sauce was not watery, and the consistency was great. I will defiantly have this recipe on rotation at my house. Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe is so delicious. My family asked when I could make it again before they were even done eating!!! I just added some minced garlic to the sauce before I put it added it.

I also read that it's risky to slow cook frozen meats, so I used thawed bone in chicken thighs and set the temp low and for 3.5hrs (I dislike overcooked meat).  As with other reviewers, I felt the sauce was too liquid-ey (though after shredding, the meat did absorb a lot of it), so I doctored it up with some flour.  I used a good quality honey bbq sauce and added onions on the bottom before covering with chicken.  The sauce came out perhaps too sweet b/c of this.  I'm not as impressed as other ppl seem to be and will not be repeating this recipe.

Update:  Followed directions and used frozen bone in leg quarters.  Used bottled sauces that were available in the fridge.  Barely even measured.  Family really liked it this time.  The meat only took 3 hrs to cook.  Still a touch too liquidy.  Will make again if I want to use up dressings and sauces.

I cooked this BBQ chicken today in the Crock Pot and upon a recent taste test, it is absolutely sublime!  I listened to previous comments and used Sweet Baby Rays BBQ Sauce (classic flavor).  I also chopped and sauteed an onion until golden brown and added it to the pot.  I am going to serve it on whole wheat hamburger buns with a slice of sharp cheddar cheese tonight.  I also made Paula Dean's Buttermilk Coleslaw as a side, which looks delicious as well.  I would definitely recommend this recipe with the previously mentioned tweaks.

This was really delicious and will definitely be added to my Sunday slow-cooking rotation.  I used raw chicken instead of frozen. I cooked on high for 3 hours, shredded the chicken, and then slow cooked for an additional hour on low per other reviews.  Delish!  I didn't change any of the ingredients.  I used KC Masterpiece Original for the BBQ sauce and Wishbone Italian dressing.

This is a great busy day recipe. I was hesitant about using frozen chicken, but it comes out so moist! I've tried it with various barbecue sauces, but I think my favorites are Sweet Baby Ray's and Lucille's. It's even a kid favorite!

Absolutely fabulous!  Due to schedule, I cooked it the night before on high for about 4 hours. Shredded the meat and let it sit all night in the sauce in the fridge. Heated it up the next day to eat it--so delicious! I used fresh chicken breast as did not have frozen. I used Meijer Carolina BBQ sauce. Also, I had no italian dressing, I subbed 1/4 c of Newmans Own Oil and Vinegar dressing instead of the 1/2 c italian dressing; still added brown sugar and worcestershire sauce as called for in recipe.  My husband told me to give it a ten before he realized the rating system only goes up to 5 stars! :)
We ate it on sub rolls with coleslaw on top. Thank you for an amazing BBQ!!
P.S. I love garlic, but this recipe DOES NOT NEED it!~

I made this last night.  It was delicious and it could not have been easier.  I followed the recipe except I used three large fresh chicken breasts that I washed first.  I cooked them on high for four hours, shredding them in the crockpot at hour three.  Fantastic!  Served them as sandwiches with some red onion.  We adored them.  This is definitely going into heavy rotation.  Perfect for football season.

Great tasting recipe!  The BBQ sauce was amazing!  I made sandwiches with these like pulled chicken.  I buttered the bread, and put some garlic salt and toasted them.  Very delicious.  The rest of the chicken I made a pizza with.  I used the Pillsbury thin crust, put the chicken and sauce on top, and added mozzarella cheese on top.  VERY GOOD!!

Very Good! I used chicken stock as suggested by another reviewer to keep the chicken from drying out. It worked, but becareful not to use to much if you go that route. Mine turned out a little too runny for sandwiches so we ate it with a fork and buscuits.

This has become a requested meal in our house.  I, like many others, prefer to use fresh chicken breasts versus the frozen.  I pair it with Jack Daniels Original No. 7 BBQ Sauce and use slightly less Italian dressing than called for.  The last two times I've made it, I've omitted the Worcestshire sauce and it was well-received.  I like to serve this with baked macaroni and cheese, coleslaw, potato buns, and (on occasion) seasoned steak fries.  A definite recommend.

This recipe was delicious and so easy. We all enjoyed it very much with a few changes as some reviewers suggested. Defrosted chicken breast before placing in crock pot, 1/2 chopped onion, 3 minced garlic cloves. I removed chicken added 1tsp cornstarch to thicken sauce, shredded chicken and put it back  into crockpot  so it soaked up that sauce another 30 min. With these changes it became 5 stars.

I made this and it was awesome the family loved it even my picky eaters. i served it on a toasted bun with sweet coleslaw. I added a tablespoon of crushed red pepper to make the chicken more tangy which works well with the sweetness of the coleslaw. Served with seasoned fries and you got yourself an easy meal that the family will ask you to make every week.

Delicious and easy. I did take the advice of reviewers and cook in chicken broth first--it almost had a brining effect and made the end result noticeably more tender than my first attempt without. Thanks for a great and easy recipe!

Wow!  This was sooo yummy!  I usually make pulled pork, but thought it would be nice to try the same idea with chicken when I came across this recipe.  The combo of italian dressing and bbq sauce made me a little skeptical, but you never know until you try... and I'm so glad I did!  I prefer this over pork now!  I followed the recipe exact, other than I used fresh chicken, cooked on high 3 hours, shredded, put back in slow cooker to mix with sauce.  Served on kaiser buns with 'sweet restaurant slaw' on this site.  Delish!  Definitely a keeper... and soo easy! 
Thanks for posting!

Very good- all comes down to the barbeque sauce!
I made this once with Kraft BBQ, and it was awful. So, I tried it again with Diana Chicken and rib, as well as a mix of ketchup, brown sugar, pepsi, and worchestchire. It was delicious!

Fixed this for dinner tonight and my husband and I thought it was definitely a keeper recipe.  I followed the directions as stated except I only had 5 thawed chicken breasts.  I took the advice of other viewers and after cooking the chicken breasts in the sauce for 3 hours I took them out and shredded them with a couple of forks.  Yes, at this point the sauce was a little thin; However, then I put the meat back in the sauce and contined to cook it.  The meat absorbed the sauce and had perfect texture and flavor.

This 60 yr old widower followed directions exactly, except did NOT add any brown sugar (diabetic). BBQ sauce has plenty of sugar out of the bottle. It was absolutely wonderful!

Made this yesterday and would have to say not too impressed.  A bit too sweet for me.  I will say it was very easy to make but will keep looking for new bbq chicken recipes.

This was pretty watery. The flavor was OK but nothing special. Could have been a lot better.

This is a good barbecue sauce for anything. I used Jack Daniels baarbecue sauce and I added about one-quarter cup of chopped onion, as I had cut the receipe in half. The sauce as made was sweet and spicy--so good!

This was such a good recipe. It was the best item at a potluck picnic this summer. Everyone loved it. I purchased all the ingredients at a Canadian Superstore. I used Splenda brown sugar instead of raw brown sugar because the Cattle Boys BBQ sauce already had enough sugar in it. I chose the PC Blue Menu Italian dressing. Instead of using buns, I used PC Blue Menu Naan bread heated with a little olive oil on the stove. Warning: if you shred your chicken super fine, it ends up absorbing away most of the sauce.

I doubled this recipe as I was cooking for a larger group. Because of this, my cooking times were longer than those outlined here. I used fresh chicken instead of frozen, just because I like to make sure I clean my chicken first, and because so many reviewers mentioned that it turned out watery. I also omitted the brown sugar because I was using honey BBQ sauce and was afraid it would be too sweet. This was a total hit with my guests and I will definitely be making it again! The leftovers will be great on BBQ chicken pizza too!

So easy to make! Modifications for me - used 3 frozen chicken breasts, but kept everything else the same (did not cut the other ingredients in half).  As suggested by others, I also waited to mix 1/2 of the BBQ sauce until after I shredded the chicken.  It was a bit watery, so I may cut the wet ingredients by 1/4 to see if that helps.

Excellent.  Full rich flavor that the family loves.  I serve the chicken over mashed potatoes or rice sometimes.  Big hit.

I made this last week and omg, the entire family LOVED it. So much so that there wasn't even any left over afterwards! My wife who doesn't really like chicken said it was the best 'homemade' bbq she's ever had, my daughter said it's her favorite thing with chicken.

I used a bbq sauce (12 bones, a local bbq place) that had molasses and i didn't have any problem with it being too runny or the other problems some have had. I cooked it for 7 hours, shredded the chicken at the 6th hour and the shredded chicken just sucked all the sauce right up.  

Seriously, this is so good I joined just to leave this review

I followed the recipe exactly, except for the Worcestershire sauce since I didn't have any on hand. I cooked it on low for 5 hours, shred the chicken, and then cooked it for another hour. It was really moist and the flavor was great. However, it tasted pretty much the same to me as my normal crock pot BBQ chicken, which is made without the Italian dressing. Others said that using frozen chicken breasts resulted in a watery sauce, but mine came out fine.

Really tasty! I followed the tip to shred the chicken after about 3 hours, which soaked up some of the extra sauce. I was worried for a bit because it was so thin, but shredding the chicken pretty much elimnated that issue. Definitely making this again!

Great recipe!  Easy to make.  Used fresh chicken and cooked on high for 3 hours.  Chicken was falling apart and easy to shred!  Used Jack Daniels BBQ sauce.

This recipe is a keeper for sure! The chicken came out so tender and full of flavor. I did thaw my chicken breasts and patted dry because reading other reviews i didnt want my sauce to get watered down. Also added a small chopped onion and some liquid smoke with famous daves sweet and tangy and a little famous daves devil spit (be careful with the devils spit becasue it has a bite!). Cooked on low for 5 hours and then pulled and shredded the chicken and added back for another two hours. Used garlic butter on some buns and toasted, added coleslaw on top of the meat to complete the sandwich. It was the perfect somertime treat with some baked beans and chips. Thank you for the simple and tasty addition to my recipe box

Delicious dinner for me and my husband.  Will definitely make more of these.  I followed the 1st review and just put it in chicken broth the first 3.5 hours and then drained and shredded the chicken and put it in with the bbq sauce mix the last hour.  I cooked it on low the whole time.  I only made 1/3 the recipe b/c it was just the two of us and it worked out great.  I had sweet baby rays sauce, so I used that.

Great! I cooked it for 3h on high, shredered, and Wondra to make the sauce thicker, and cook for another hour on high. I used both cheap and expensive bbq sauce, and both turned out very well. I would even recommend to use the cheaper one.

This recipe is insanely easy!  The changes I made to this recipe are that I use fresh chicken, and I cook it on high for 3 hours and then shred the chicken, then cook on high for one more hour.  I use Sweet Baby Rays Honey BBQ sauce.  I have it on wheat buns.  Turns out really good and it's pretty healthy!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Was good, thawed chicken breast most of the way and it was still a little watery for my liking. Will try fresh breast next time to see if it happen.

This recipe was so easy and delicious!  The whole family loved it!  I served it on sandwich rolls that I browned.  Just smear the bread with  butter and add a light sprinkling of garlic powder and  garlic salt.
I will definitely be making this again!!

The best pulled "pork" recipe ever!

I used Bull's Eye B-B-Q Sauce (Texas style), added a medium chopped onion and 6 large chopped garlic cloves and didn't alter the recipe in any other way, except my THREE very large breasts were fresh and not frozen.

I shredded the chicken after two hours on high heat and, in less than an additional hour, this dish was finished.  I served it open-style on potato rolls along with cole slaw and a mixed-leaf green salad.  Delicious and healthy!

My husband LOVED this spicy treat but I had a hard time convincing him that the meat was chicken and not pork!

Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

So tender and delicious. I used fresh chicken breasts and added onion and garlic. I used the leftovers to make nachos-amazing!

I had to improvise but even that made these very fine chicken legs.  Yummy.  Another great way to fix chicken which is always needed.  I thank you ever so much.  I will use this one often.

This chicken was great! Like other reviews there was a lot of liquid but once I shredded the chicken it soaked it all up! I also used sweet baby rays BBQ sauce as recommended! It was a big hit!!

Pretty good, but the sauce came out a bit runny. I would also recommend cooking the chicken completely beforehand and then peeling it apart with a fork before putting it in the slow cooker. But the Italian dressing tastes great with it!

Great flavors.  I have made this exactly according to recipe several times, and my whole family loves it.  We put it over buns, and it is great and easy.  I love that you can throw in frozen chicken.

This recipe was AMAZING.  I too used fresh chicken rather than frozen and adjusted the cooking time.  I brushed the bun with a garlic/herb/oil blend and broiled it to make it a bit crispier.  I also put the chicken on the bottom half of the bun, put pepper jack cheese on top and broiled until the cheese melted.  Served with ranch dressing (fat mans ketchup) and sweet potato fries for a mind blowing meal.  Will make again very soon.

Excellent and so easy! I cooked 4 frozen chicken breasts in low-sodium chicken broth, sliced onion and garlic on high for 3 hours and drained it. Then I shredded the chicken, returned it to the crockpot and put the barbeque sauce/italian dressing mixture in and cooked it on low for another 5 hours. It was very tasty! This is a keeper!

I used Jack Daniel's original bbq sauce with this recipe and it came out wonderfully delicious.  I didn't change anything about it, followed the directions as they were.  After being at work all day and walking into the house, the aroma hit me and I was very happy with the results!  We had family over for this and I was nervous about using a new recipe.  But everyone loved it and I can't wait to make it again.  I will note: fresh baked buns from the grocery store and not prepackaged ones will make the diffrence!

I used 7 frozen chicken breasts and cooked overnight for a potluck the next day.  I did not add the brown sugar because I used Baby Ray's Brown Sugar and Hickory BBQ sauce.  I only put in 1 T of Worcestershire sauce and of course 1/2 c. dressing.  When I woke in the morning it smelled great in the house.  Chicken was very easy to shred.  There was plenty of "juice" and I let it soak it up till serving time.  The group at the party really liked it.  Nice and easy, and very tasty.  Think I will try this out as a regular in my menu rotation.
Update- 7/20/17 still a winner. Made with three fresh not frozen chicken breasts. Cooked on low 5 hours. Took chicken out with slotted spoon and he's a TIP-  put chicken in stand mixer to shred. You'll never shred with forks again. So easy. Put shredded chicken back in on warm for one hour. Awesome!

Very good! Better than just plain BBQ sauce and chicken.  The leftovers were even better, had more flavor.  First night we had this on bread for sandwich. With the leftovers, heated it up, threw it in a tortilla with monterey jack cheese and sauteed peppers and onions-excellent!

this is very good. insted of buying a bottle of sauce I made it with a recipe that I found on here(nana's bbq sauce). I used bonless skinless chicken strips because that is what I had in the freezer. it turned out good but it was a little to jucy for me so i added corn starch to thicken it. will make again.

Not bad. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used four breasts instead of six. The chicken was so tender that it fell apart after about three hours in the crock pot.

I made this with everything except the brown sugar, since we used Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce and my husband asked me not to add sugar. I added a tablespoon of liquid smoke. It was delicious. Only thing is, I don't know if I did something wrong, but the chicken shrunk a lot. It started out normal sized and ended up kind of tiny. I could have possibly cooked it too long, but next time I think I will just add more chicken.

I didn't change a thing and it was a hit with the family!  My husband and son are pork and beef lovers and they both ate thirds!  I work swing shift and I don't have much time to cook, but this was a perfect "mix and leave" recipe!  Thank you for an awesome, easy and delicious recipe!

This was fairly good. Super easy to make. I forgot to get italian dressing so I had to make my own, not a biggy but I think it was to oily. I will try this again using the store bought dressing. I also used sweet baby rays bbq sauce. Hubby liked the meal.

It was delicious! didn't need to add the flour as others recommended because the chicken after shredded soaked up the whole barbecue sauce, had some french onion fries with it and it was absolutely delicious!! Thanks for a pretty cool recipe :) The boyfriend and I loved it! :)

Excellent!  Made with Sweet Baby Rays and it was great.  Chicken was nice and moist.  Added some extra sauce to the sandwich.

We love this! I have made it several times, and have found that we prefer a sweeter BBQ sauce (we use Austin's Own mild). I also add a little extra brown sugar, as that's just what we prefer. I also usually use thawed chicken, although I have made it both ways and it's just as good both ways. Otherwise, I follow the recipe as it's written and it's fantastic!

Fantastic and so easy!!  My husband (picky) and kids (picky and pickier) all loved it.  I only got one tenderloin because the three of them ate the other 11!.  Thanks for a great recipe!

My boyfriend's first words upon tasting this were "Mmmmm!".  I've never heard him say that in 3 years (admittiedly im not a very skilled cook).  Followed suggestions from Cooking 101's review dated 07/27/06 and it turned out perfect.  Excited to try leftovers tomorrow!

It was okay, but way too sweet! I recommend omitting the brown sugar all together and using fresh chicken breasts.

Loved this recipe.  I use Dinosaur BBQ sauce and took out the sugar.  Sugar in the BBQ sauce already, so I didn't think it needed any more.  VERY GOOD.  My whole family LOVED IT.

I've made a similar recipe before and recall that I was advised to use more sauce.  So for this recipe, I did 6 fresh chicken breasts (big ones from Costco) and doubled the sauce.  Kept everything else the same.  I shredded the chicken and then put it back in the sauce.  Delicious!

This was good and I'll probably make it again. As others mentioned, I used thawed chicken instead of frozen. I also cut up the chicken 3 hours in to absorb more of the juices. And next time I'd probably put more chicken in because there was a bit too much sauce for my liking.

I followed the directions to a T. I've been accustomed to Texas bbq for over a decade now and this did NOT give me what I was wanting.  It was easy, very moist, fall apart chicken but the flavor and consistency wasn't there.
Hubby and I didn't care for it, kids loved it.
Thanks for sharing but I probably won't make this again.

Great recipe!  I only used 4 chicken breasts and added a 1/2 of chopped onion.  I also used a "Dave's" BBQ.  Cooked on low for 6-7 hrs. Awesome flavor and great leftovers!  Served with bbq rice and cole slaw.  My 3 year old LOVED it :)

I used a barbecue sauce that isn't my favorite, but this recipe was still good. I had two HUGE frozen boneless skinless chicken breasts and made the regular amount of sauce. While they were cooking there was barely enough sauce to cover the breasts, so I don't know how I was going to be able to fit 6 in there. If they were smaller and thawed you could possibly jam them in there. Maybe the author of the recipe can add another measurement such as lbs, oz, ect. so that we have a better idea of the volume that's needed. But this was ok for me to have extra sauce cause I like my BBQ pretty sloppy. :)

Pretty good recipe.  I halved the recipe and used a couple of bone-in chicken breasts.  I added half a chopped-up onion to the recipe as well.  When I pulled out the chicken to shred it, I added a couple of tablespoons of flour to the liquid to help thicken it.  The end result was pretty good.  I think the only thing I'll change will be not adding the brown sugar next time since it was a little too sweet.  I used Jack Daniels BBQ sauce, which is a little sweet so that's probably the reason it was a little sweeter than I'd like.

This is delicious. On the days I want to save a little time, I buy a rotisserie chicken and shred it myself. I do agree with other reviewers: The brand of the barbeque sauce matters! I use Jack Daniels original sauce and tastes perfect when it comes out. My picky husbands requests this quite often! I make this with mashed potatoes and steamed vegetables for a complete meal. Yum!

Dish was amazing! This was my first slow cooker and it came out fantastic. I used 4 breasts instead of the 6, and thawed them out the night before as suggested in the previous reviews. Definitely will make again, and will be trying with pork roast as well!

Very good recipe! Like other posters, I pulled the chicken about 3 hours into cooking and stirred the BBQ sauce so the chicken would soak it up. Great flavor.

Really good, just wish I'd added a little more sauce than called for.  Needed some "smack", but a very simple and delicious recipe. I used the Famous Dave's Bold and Sassy BBQ sauce.

It was flavorful, and I love cooking anything in the crockpot, but it was way too juicy.  We made open-faced sandwiches, but we were really looking forward to actual sandwiches in a bun.  I don't think we'll make this again.

Score!
This recipe was awesome! I did add 2 TBSP of Apple Cider Vinegar...personal taste...and it came out great. I removed some of the juice while shredding and added about half back. Will make again, for sure!

Wow. Super awesome!  I read all of the reviews and still went with the frozen chicken.  The only changes I made.. Used a small bottle of Sweet Baby Ray BBQ sauce (18 0z) and put about 3/4 of it in the mix.  Cooked on high for about 2 hours. The last hour- shred the chicken and add the rest of the bbq sauce. It comes out perfect!! No need to cook longer than that!

Delish!  This recipe was great!  I added onion and fresh garlic to the sauce also, and like others, I used fresh chicken and cooked it on low for five hours.  I would recommend cooking it less, mine was a tad dry (until I added more of the sauce mix, which I reserved some of and added during the last hour).  I would recommend cooking for three hours then shred the chicken, and add the reserve sauce with about an hour left.  Mine was also a little watery so I also added about a fourth of a cup of flour to thicken it up before I shredded the chicken.  It turned out so goooooddddd!  My boyfriend and I literally used our fingers to clean our plates.  I will definately be making this again!

This was pretty good.  Based on other reviews, I defrosted my chicken first and threw it in the slow cooker with two cups of chicken stock.  I made the sauce in a bowl - no alterations (I used Sweet Baby Ray's Original and Wishbone Light Italian dressing).  When the chicken was done, I drained it, shredded it, and added it to the sauce.  I kept it warm on the stovetop til I was ready to serve it, but you could put it back in the slow cooker.  I served it on hot dog buns with extra sharp Cracker Barrel cheese and we all liked it a lot.

This was really good!  It's a bit sweet, so maybe leave out the brown sugar if you like it more savory.  I added carrots and onions at the beginning of the cook time and green peppers one hour before the end.

These were okay but I would've been satisfied just using a bottle of my favorite bbq sauce. I like it shredded chunky and placed back in the crock pot for an hour. Before serving, I broiled it for a few minutes.

I was pretty pleased with this dish. I love the concept of adding the Italian dressing to the BBQ sauce, it gave it a great zing...my only regret is that I used a Carolina Style Sauce (Mustard Based) in the cooker, if I were to make it over again (and I will) I will use a Memphis Style sauce, which will probably change my opinion of this crock pot recipe to 5 stars.

Fantastic!  Entire family loved it.  Used about 5 semi-defrosted breasts, KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce and store brand Italian dressing.  Plenty sweet so could have left out the sugar, but it was fine w/ it.  Added 1/2 chopped onion.  I cooked on high 3 1/2 hours, shredded the chicken and then let it cook another 30 minutes.  Served on hoagie buns.  So yum!

GREAT simple meal. Tastes better than you'd think it would!

I 100% agree with the other reviewers. The sauce and the dressing you use make a HUGE impact - don't just buy the cheap stuff! I like a very zesty dressing and a very tangy bbq that isn't too sweet. Perfect!

Amazingly EASY!!! I used Jack Daniel's BBQ Sauce. It came out super moist and yummy! We didn't bring any left overs home, so I'm starting a new batch right now!! ( Made for a New Years Eve gathering) Thank you for the super easy recipe! I will be making this very often!

We were very impressed with how this turned out.  It was moist, flavorful, and easy.  I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 due only to cook time.  When cooked 4 hours on high it came out dry, but when cooked on High for 1 hour then Low for 5 it turned out super moist.  For taste adjustments, I also added onion and garlic to the original recipe.

Very good! I made this for my dad and he loved it, said it was better than sloppy joes...lol.  I followed the recipe to a T, except I didn't add brown sugar since I am not a fan of sweet chicken.  But I did shred the chicken after 3 and half hours and then I put it back in the crock pot for about 45 min like others have suggested.

This is so simple and delicious! I love that the ingredients are usually items that you already have on hand! I did add 2 heaping tablespoons of dried onions to the mix to give it some added flavor although I have a feeling it wouldn't have needed it. This is definitely on my list of things to make again! Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

This was really good and super easy. I didnt have italian dressing so I used balsamic vineagrette dressing. It was delicous, got rave reviews from my hubby and 10 yr old daughter. I served it with white rice (really good with the sauce) and cornbread. And we had the left overs 2 days later with mashed potatoes and green beans. Just as delicous the second time and so simple with the slow cooker.

Excellent and devilishly easy. I added Sweet Baby Rays Honey BBQ, chopped onion, and minced garlic to the suggested recipe. I was able to throw together 4 frozen breasts at noon and it was all ready by 5 (1/2 high heat, 1/2 low). I also dabbed a paper towel in to collect the extra grease from chicken. Served with cheesy mash potatos and steamed broccoli. Thanks!!

We enjoyed this BBQ! I omitted the brown sugar b/c I bought honey BBQ sauce. I used 4 large chicken breasts and cooked them for 4 hrs on low, then left on warm while I prepared my sides. I took the chicken out and shredded it with two forks and then put it back in the sauce in the crockpot. Served with baked potatoes and coleslaw and it was a super quick and easy meal.

I love this chicken dish!  I also took the advice of others by shredding the chicken in the sauce.  I used 2 large chicken breasts and one thigh/leg quarter all skinless.  I season my chicken first then freeze it using freezer bags until ready to use.  The chicken was completely thawed before I placed it in the crock pot.  When it was about 90% done, I drained the oil, added the sauce to the crock pot, then added the shredded chicken. I cooked it for about an hour longer.  For my sauce:  I also used Sweet Baby Ray's Honey barbecue sauce based on the advice from another user.  The sauce had a great consistency once done.  Here are some things I did differently:  I didn't have Worcestershire sauce so instead I used a little soy sauce and more of the Teriyaki sauce.  I also used Bruschetta Italian dressing by Wishbone (delicious!!)  I omitted the sugar since Teriyaki is already sweet. I also chopped an onion and some fresh garlic and cooked it with the sauce in the last hour.  I served on top of a baked potato with shredded sharp cheddar.  A delicious dish!!

After making this my husband said "this is one of the best meals you've ever made."  That pretty much says it all. An amazing, ridiculously easy recipe. Along with a lot of the reviewers here the only changes I made were: used a little bit less brown sugar than the recipe called for and shredded the chicken with about an hour left on the cooking to help the meat absorb more of the sauce. Really can't recommend this enough.

Loved this recipe!  Cooked it on low for about seven hours, literally fell apart itself, didn't have to worry about shredding.  Delicious!

This recipe is great!  My chicken was a little dry, so next time I will probably add a can of chicken broth, but the flavor was AWESOME!  Definitely will make again and maybe try the sauce with some ribs.

Delicious! Thanks for the new recipe!  I used 3 fresh chicken breasts instead.  Cooked on high for 3 hours, shredded the chicken, then cooked another hour.  Yum!

Awesome recipe!  We made this for a family gathering and everyone raved over it.  We used Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ sauce and store brand Italian Dressing.  It was the perfect ratio of sweet to zesty.  The only thing we added was a teaspoon of Liquid Smoke, as suggested by previous posters.  Don't panic if the sauce looks a little thin towards the end--once you shred the chicken and stir it back in, it'll thicken up in no time with the lid off.  Otherwise, stir in a little flour.  Definitely a keeper! Thanks!

So easy and sooooo freaking good.  I never use frozen chicken and I cook it on high for about 4 hours and it perfectly juicy and flavorful.  I do pull it all apart about 4 hours and let it sit and cook on low for another 30 min or so. And I forgot to add that I use a little liquid smoke as well- adds to the flavor- but dont use much!

This was absolutely delicious and so easy.  I cooked on high for four hours until the chicken was "shred tender."  Removed and shredded chicken, added chicken back into the crock pot with the barbecue sauce, and heated for another 30 minutes.  Once I shredded the chicken, the sauce wasn't a bit watery.  Everyone raved about it, and it was even better reheated the next day.  A keeper :)

I followed the recipe exactly (using Stubb's smokey mesquite barbecue sauce and Girard's Venice Italian dressing) and thought it turned out pretty darn good.  The chicken was extremely moist and tender, but there were a few things I'd like to improve.   The dish was very wet and saucy even after having cooked for the last hour on high with the crock pot lid off (to cook off some liquid)- I'll have to experiment with cooking time or using thawed chicken to see if that makes the sauce thicker.  The other issue was that my boyfriend thought the chicken was too sweet- I can't stand super-sweet barbecue sauce and I was okay with the amount of sweetness, but I will likely reduce the sugar next time to get a more complex taste.  I served this on broiled kaiser buns with cole slaw and French's onion crisps- I was trying to recreate a local restaurant's chicken sandwich and it was a pretty close approximation!

Amazing!  My family loved this!  It is easy to make and yields enough to have leftovers for an entire meal in the future.  I also froze some in a glad container which I covered with foil.  It reheated beautifully.

Very easy recipe and very tasty. Added a little less BBQ sauce and shredded the chicken at the last minute, stirred around so the sauce covered it all. Yummy on a cheese bun with a slice of old cheddar. Will make again.

Great recipe!! I made this for my fiance and I, and he took it to work for lunch the next day and several people asked for the recipe.  I did change/add a few thing:

- I used 3 fresh chicken breasts (as others suggested)... before adding them to the crock pot, I poked holes in them and seasoned them with salt, pepper, and 6 cloves of chopped fresh garlic (we love garlic!)
- I used Jack Daniels BBQ sauce (as others suggested)
- I omitted the Worcestershire sauce (didn't have any - it doesn't need it)
- I added 1/2 cup chopped green onion
- I also added 1/2 cup chicken broth

I serve mine on a chiabata bun or a hawaiian bread roll.  If you find your sauce too watery, add a starch slurry (mix one tablespoons water to one tablespoon corn starch in a small bowl, then add to mixture)

I appreciate that you need to use a high quality BBQ sauce.  And perhaps that is where I went wrong - in that the brand and flavor was off.  However, I found the combination of BBQ sauce and italian dressing to be conceptually strange- and in the end, not tasty.  UPDATE:  My husband who loved BBQ, ate it and said it was fine.  I added a few stars.

I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great! However it was border line too sweet for me. I used Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce, but next time I think I will use a different brand that's a little less sweet and it will be perfect.

Best BBQ chicken I have EVER had! I used Kraft Original BBQ sauce and only used 4 breasts (because they were huge!). About an hour before we ate I pulled the chicken to let it simmer in the sauce. A new favorite for my husband and I.....and it was SOOO easy!

New family favorite! So easy to make and tastes great. I followed several other's suggestions and shredded the chicken into the sauce. I've used 8 frozen chicken breasts and it completely absorbed all the juices! (So if you want it to seem to have a little sauce, don't add extra chicken.) As others also suggested, it works fabulously with ribs and pork too!

Very tasty. I used Bulleye's Guinesss BBQ sauce and Kraft calorie-wise zesty Italian dressing. My crock pot is in need of repair, so I simmered the concoction in a covered non-stick frying pan on the stove all afternoon. Eaten with fried onions and the soft sandwich buns recipe submitted by Lesa Young

GREAT recipe! Super easy and awesome.
Few tips:
1. EVERYTHING depends on the BBQ sauce you use. We used the trader joes Kentucky gold and it was awesome (and the TJ balsamic italian dressing).
2. You don't need the sugar! I skipped it completely and we didn't miss a thing.
3. dark..light...doesn't matter what meat you use - it all tastes the same.  Save yourself some calories and stick with white.
4. I used frozen breasts and it was perfect.
5. I threw in some onions and they were a total hit.

This was easy to make. I made sandwiches out of it, the kids didn't really eat it, but hubby and I did, next time will put it over rice, kids will eat it then because they love rice.

This receipt is AMAZINGLY good.  So easy.  I think that the BBQ sauce makes a big difference.  I used Sweet Baby Rays (my fav) and it turned out great. I also used only 3 frozen chicken breasts instead of 6, and left the rest of the recipe as is so that I would have extra sauce.  My sauce was thick and the chicken soaked it up.  I didn't have any issues with it being soupy at all.  LOVE this recipe and will definitely be making it again.

Yummy! This turned out so delicious. I added some chopped onion, about 1/2 of a large onion. I mixed it in with the sauce before pouring over the chicken. I cooked it on high for about 3 1/2 hours. Then, I took out the chicken and shredded it. I strained the sauce into a pan and cooked it down some on the stove to thicken it a bit. Then I poured it over the shredded chicken. I served it on whole wheat hamburger buns with slices of colby jack cheese. My kids loved it!! Even the pickiest one. It was so easy and I was able to make it quickly with what I had on hand. I will definitely be making this again! Thanks for a great recipe!

I wasn't too sure about this one because of the odd ingredients and I haven't had much success with slow cooker chicken, but I was wrong. It was really good and easy. I followed another reviewer's advice and used a higher end bbq sauce (I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce) which really wasn't that much more expensive, but I was very happy with how it turned out. I also shredded the chicken and let it cook for another half hour per a reviewer's suggestion. I served with watermelon, corn on the cob and cole slaw. Perfect, easy, and good. Thank you for the recipe.

amazing recipe... i added some red pepper flakes to add some heat to it and it was perfect.  the one thing i was surprised about was that in the directions it doesn't state when to start pulling the meat apart.  i followed someone elses suggestion to start an hour before it was ready by pulling it apart with two forks and it worked perfectly.  it was a good amount of time to let the liquid soak into the meat.  love this recipe, will be making it all the time!

This was a GREAT recipe! I added peppers and onions to the mix and it turned out wonderful. We used Famous Daves Sweet and Sassy bbq sauce. My fiance says we need to make it a regular meal in our home. Leftovers were great as well.

I used Sweet Baby Ray's Honey (4 oz) and Sweet Baby Ray's Regular BBQ sauce. Everyone loved the taste. The sauce wasn't thick so next time I will probably decrease the liquid amounts however this sauce has so much flavor! I tried the pork slow cooker recipe and everyone prefers this sauce/recipe. I will make this one again! Thanks for sharing!

This was fantastic!! The only thing i changed was i left out the worschester sauce and added a whole chopped onion. It had a bit of thin juice/sauce which i liked, yet the hubs preffered it to be drained. So easy, so good, and even better the next day!!

This recipe is super easy and super good!  i used KC Masterpiece BBQ Sauce.  Just the original variety and it turned out great as a sandwich filler and also as BBQ Chicken Salad.  Great Recipe!

This came out so tender and delicious.  I only had about 1/3 of a bottle of barbeque sauce so I whisked it together with a mixture of apple cider vinegar, brown sugar, ketchup, balsamic vinaigrette dressing, salt, garlic powder and chili powder.  I used a little more Worcestershire sauce than the recipe calls for and also put in a diced onion, diced green pepper, and a diced tomato with the chicken.  I cooked in in a crockpot for about 6 hours on low and it came out great.  After shredding the chicken and adding some sauce to keep it moist, I would suggest keeping the extra sauce on the side so people can add the amount they prefer on their sandwiches.  I served my chicken on wheat sandwich buns with pickles, alfalfa sprouts and cheddar cheese.  I'll definitely use this recipe again.

Good recipe. I used defrosted breasts. Be sure to use really good bbq sauce. Makes a difference.

My husband loves this chicken recipe! I had to make it twice last week and he wants it again this week. Even my kids ate it, which was a shocker. I used bbq sauce that was brown sugar and hickory the first time then a sweet and tangy sauce the second (didn't come out as good.) I will continue to use a brown sugar & hickory bbq sauce. Thanksk for sharing this recipe!!!

Great recipe.  Tastes amazing.  I am not sure if it is just mine or all slow cookers, but mine was overdone cooking it this long.  I would just adjust to how quickly your slower cooker cooks and it will be amazing.

My Fiancé and I loved this meal. It may become one of our usual weekley meals (like pizza night.) He even asked for the left overs to take to work for lunch the next day. This is totally worth trying if you have any questions about making it or not :)

I was debating between this and a buffalo chicken slow cooker.  I had a few BBQ sauces in my fridge and mixed a spicy asian BBQ and a brown sugar BBQ.  I omitted the brown sugar because I had the brown sugar BBQ sauce.  I cooked on high for 3 hours, shredded, and cooked on low for the last hour.  The chicken was amazing and I have lots of leftovers.  So simple yet amazing, thanx for sharing!

Delish!!!!  Following the advice of another reviewer I used good quality ingredients.  And living in the Kansas City are I certainly had my choice of high quality, local BBQ sauces to choose from.  I went with the Summit Hickory Pit BBQ sauce and Wishbone Italian.

Love this recipe! Very versatile and forgiving. I have made this several times and it always turns out great! I use frozen chicken (which is fine as long as you let it cook all the way) I use whatever marinades, sauces, etc. I happen to have on hand and usually add some extra peppers and onions. I put the slow cooker on high and forget about it. After about 4 hour I shred the chicken and then let it cook for about another hour. Serve over potatoes, or on a sandwich, or tortillas, whatever you like.

My family and friends loved this recipe.  Instead of shredding the chicken I served the breasts in halves as an entree with rice and veggies.  I was told that this is the best  chicken my husband has ever had.

My husband and I loved this. Since it was cheaper to do it this way, we just bought a 1lb package of chicken tenderloins, but they weren't frozen. Then, I just changed the servings to 4 to get my measurements. I used a combination of Neely's BBQ sauce and Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ. I will definitely be making this again and again! :)

Delicious!  And SUPER EASY!  We like to try it with all different types of barbecue sauces and see what we like best.  On of our favorites is a Bulls Eye Spicy Red Pepper barbecue sauce.  I passed this on to my mom and she makes it regularly!  Makes awesome leftovers too!

I didn't read the reviews before hand and ended up using a vinegar-based bbq sauce so it did come out a little watery, even though I shredded the chicken and then cooked another hour on low. However, it was still very tasty.

Finally something I can throw in the slow cooker and forget about when I've forgotten to plan dinner (and only have meat that's frozen solid).  It tastes fantatstic!!!  I use both pork and chicken for this recipe, sometimes mixed.  Always a favorite!

Very good if you're a BBQ sandwich fan. It definitely matters which BBQ sauce you use, so find one you like. Also, the amount of sauce to chicken in this recipe is too much. Feel free to throw in several extra chicken tenders - there will be plenty of sauce to go around. I like sliced onions on my sandwich; it gives it an extra zing.

This dish was fantastic!  It took 5 minutes to throw together and it made the whole kitchen smell wonderful.  I wasn't so sure about the zesty Italian dressing, but I decided to try it.  It really added to the flavor.  On a bun with dill pickles = YUMMY!  This one is definitely a keeper.

Do NOT put the chicken in still frozen. The sauce ends up being really watery as a result.

That being said, the combination of flavors is really good. I was skeptical about mixing italian dressing with bbq sauce and was pleasantly surprised.

Few ingredients, easy and tasty! Used Famous Daves Zesty BBQ sauce, my chicken was thawed already but still cooked them on high 4 hours, shredded then on warm for another hour.  Will be trying this with pork next! Thanks!

This was YUMMY! I did have to add some more sugar when it was done because I thought it was too tangy for my taste. After the sugar was added, it was perfect! I ate a serving for lunch and another for dinner...the bf served himself 3 times! Definitely keeping this one for future use. Thanks!

Very yummy.  Just FYI, you can cook this quicky by just boiling the chicken breasts (frozen even) and shredded and then adding the sauce.  Not quite as good as it sitting all day but still good!

It was good but a little bland. I thought the sauce was just too thin. I broke up the chicken and it did soak it up some, but the flavor just wasn't what I hoped for. Not sure how I would change it, but I will work with it and figure something out. It was a good start to something I think...

My grocery store had a great sale on bone-in breasts, so I used those.  I have a 5-Qt cooker, so I had to layer the chicken.  After 3 hours on high, the top layer was not cooked, so I put the top layer on the bottom and the bottom layer on top.  I cooked for 2 more hours on high.  I removed the chicken and shredded it, setting it aside.  I strained the liquid in case there were any bones and set the sauce aside.  I put the chicken back in the cooker, put in the sauce, stirred a couple of times and cooked another hour.    
     I did not add the brown sugar.  I added 2 Tblsp. of soy sauce and used Sweet Baby Ray's Regular BBQ Sauce.  I also added the diced onions that others have suggested.
     EVERYONE loved it!

Just made this and it was sooo delicious and easy.  I only used 3 chicken breasts.  Threw them in the crockpot fully frozen.  Made the sauce exactly as instructed and poured over the frozen chicken.  Cooked on high for 3 hours.  Then I removed the chicken and pulled it apart and threw it back in the crockpot on low for one more hour.  I used fresh Kaiser rolls and a small slab of mayonaise.  It was sooo good!

Oh my goodness! This was so yummy and, even better, SO EASY!!! I love these ever so easy, throw a few ingredients in the crock pot recipes!  The chicken just falls apart when you go to shred it. mmmmmmm.  

Make sure you get good rolls to serve this dish on.

I made this for a party and it was a huge success!  I received many requests for the recipe.  The only change I made is that I added some thinly sliced red/ green peppers and onions.  So important to use a good quality BBQ sauce as well.   We wrap the leftovers in corn tortillas the next day.

This was really good and very, very easy.  Used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce and Newman's Own Lighten Up Basalmic Dressing.  I also added 1/2 cup chopped onion.  Had no Worcestershire so used A1 Steak Sauce.  Served over toasted rolls and had a broccoli slaw on the side that I actually added to the top of my sandwich.  Yum!  With a side of homemade cornbread and baked beans it was a great meal that I will serve again and again.

Super easy and tastes great!  I work 12 hour shifts, so I can turn this on low when I leave for work.  When I get home I just shred the chicken and put on buns.  I served it with some potato salad I had made the day before. I'm making it for the second time today! Great recipe!

Family loved it (2 teens + parents).  I used 2 bone in chicken breasts and 2 bone in thighs, added 1.5 c chicken stock, cooked on #2 for 3 hours, then on #1 for 2 hours (while gone). Drained liquid, deboned and shredded.  Added bbq sauce, italian dressing and worc. sauce to crock pot while shredding, added chicken and sliced red onion, cooked on #3 for 30-40 minutes while prepping the rest of the meal. Served on buns, tops brushed with oil, dash of garlic salt and broiled for 1.5 min.  We tried 3 different cheeses - provolone, cheddar and swiss.  I preferred provolone.  Great meal served with salad, carrot sticks, celery sticks, and sliced peaches.

This was absolutely delicious. I used frozen chicken thighs, 18 oz bottle of Kraft Honey Roasted Garlic barbeque sauce, 1/2 c italian salad dressing, no brown sugar (didn't have any), 2 Tbs Worc. Sauce, ! Tbs Liquid smoke 1/2 large vidalia onion, 4 whole cloves of garlic after reading several reviews and based on personal preferences. I cooked the chicken on high for 3 hours then deboned and shredded the chicken then cooked on low for 1 hour. I served it over a baked potato with cheddar cheese, sour cream, and chives for myself. My hubby preferred his on a sandwich. My picky 17 year old daughter said "this tastes really good mom, better than that restaurant we go to."  Thank you for a terrific family recipe!

Family loves this! Super easy and super delicious! And there are so many things you can do with it. I use the leftovers on a green salad, or on a tortilla as a mini taco. My 3 year old granddaughter just eats the chicken with a fork along with the rest of her meal. It is so versatile that it can be individually adjusted to fit everyone's taste buds. My son-in-law adds Balsamic vinegar for extra zip. I basically prepare it according to recipe, but last night I was out of Italian dressing, so just used vege oil with some Italian seasoning, and it was fine. This is a staple dish in our household.

I made this exactly as the recipe directed. Instead of store bought salad dressing, I made a very tasty Basic Italian Salad Dressing found on Epicurious.
I stopped cooking the chicken after I measured the internal chicken temperature at 180F - this was almost 6 hours on low.
On sampling the food, the sauce was very acidic. This might have something to do with the BBQ sauce having vinegar in it and then adding a salad dressing, which even store bought dressing has vinegar in it. That is lots of acidity in my opinion!
The chicken had formed a crispiness on the exterior. Internally it was pull-apart easy (kind of like pulled pork), however, I found the chicken dry.
Perhaps cooking the chicken from frozen had something to do with this.
All in all, this is something I will not be making again.

This recipe is easy and good!  I prepared as directed using Sweet Baby Ray's Original BBQ sauce and Ken's Northern Italian dressing.  I made with 2 chicken breasts since it was for two but makes great leftovers so next time will you 4-6.

I was sadly disappointed with the recipie. I used fresh chicken breasts and followed the recipie exactly using Jack Daniels Original. It was alright but nothing phenomenal. I think it will be better today after it's sat overnight, may freeze some for BBQ chicken pizza later as mentioned in some of the reviews.

This just does not get any better!  Holy moly!  I used 3 frozen boneless skinless chicken breasts and placed in the crockpot with 1 bottle of natural bbq sauce, tuscan italian dressing the same amounts of brown sugar and w sauce and it was fabulous!  We are not bbq people and was very leary about trying this. Well we are glad we did. My husband could not stop eating it and my 4 year old who eats nothing but chicken tenders/nuggets ate his share too! Thanks so much for sharing. I will be making this frequently.

This was excellent!  I made it exactly as directed and my husband LOVED it.  I used the Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce since that is my husbands favorite.  The second time I made it, my husband had me drain some Baked Beans and add that to it also.  I will be making this many more times in the future!

I made this yesterday for dinner and the only thing I changed was used Greek dressing instead of Itailian because I did not have any Itailian.  This turned out great!  My husband loved it!

I read the reviews from those others who found the chicken got mushy or dry or that there was no taste to the actual chicken. I used frozen chicken since I was going to be at work all day. I also added water to help retain the moisture. I seasoned the chicken and also added red onions and other spices. After cooking in the bbq mix for 8 hours, the chicken was still dry and a bit mushy and no real seasoning to it after soaking in bbq sauce. I think that this may be good to cook on high for 2 hours in your crockpot but not for more than that. It was good to try something new, but I won't be trying this again.

I've tried this and must say I was disappointed based on all the other reviews. The sauce was just too watery for me and although the flavor was ok I think using frozen chicken was not the best idea. I like a more thicker sause; it wasn't like BBQ sauce at all it was overpowered by the dressing and water from the frozen chicken.

This was pretty good I made extra so I could use it for other meals too ...... pizza and stuffed potatoes.  I changed the serving calculator to 16 and used the amounts it suggested but I didn't use frozen chicken.  When I first put the chicken in the crockpot I added about a cup of chicken broth and cooked it on high for 3 hours.  Then I shred it and put it back in the crockpot on low with the sauce ingredients for about 2 hours.  It turned out perfect no problem with the sauce being watery .... I used Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce.

Absolutely divine. And so easy! After reading reviews of others saying theirs dried up, (and knowing my slow cooker dries everything up) I added 1/4 cup of water to the mix and it was absolutely perfect. I don't even like BBQ sauce and I couldn't help picking this out of the pot and eating it! Very delicious, definitely having this again.

We love this recipe. I use a packet of dry Italian dressing instead of an oil based dressing and always end up with a nice thick sauce. If it lasts till the next day the leftovers are even better! We have made it the night before and reheated for dinner the next day with great success.

This was amazing! I didn't use any italian dressing, just BBQ and W. sauces.  This didn't last long in my house. it was delicious on a toasted roll, cheddar cheese melted under the broiler. YUM.  This is a new must in my house.

Unfortunately my sauce turned out to be quite watery and my chicken overcooked.  It was still edible, just a little stringy.  This was with a setting at high for 3 hours, remove chicken, shred and then return to crock pot for 1 hour on low.  I'm starting to think my crock pot cooks at a higher temp than most.

Great recipe!  We made this for a party we were having so we used 15 chicken breasts.  That's about the max you can fit in a standard crock pot.  I think we did about 3-4 hours on high and then another couple hours on low.  It was difficult to shred since there were so many breasts but it worked out well.  We also had to add a little flour since it was a bit runny.  It turned out great though!  Everyone loved it.

I prepared this meal just as the recipe/directions called, but was terribly disappointed with the bland flavors. It just needs some zest or tang or something.

excellent! I have made this with frozen and fresh chicken, both were great. For those who thinks this turns out runny,I  followed the tips on shredding the chicken and let it cook for a little while longer. MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE! it really soaks up the extra liquid. in fact if the next time I make 6 ckn breasts i will add extra sauce because it soaked so much of it up. i also followed a tip about putting butter and garlic powder on the rolls then broiling them, the mix of the garlic and barbeque sauce was wonderful.

I made this chicken for the Superbowl.  I made it with fresh chicken and put it in the crockpot on High for 3 hours.  I had to turn the crockpot off after 2 1/2 because the chicken started to dry out.  Overall I wasn't impressed with the recipe.  It was better the next day but overall I was disappointed.

Very good, but my reccommendation would be to cook the chicken for awhile first and pour off some of the liquid before adding the sauce.  With the sauce and everything cooked together it was a little runny.

I've made this several times already. Yum! Last time I replaced 1/2 the amount of the Italian dressing with Buffalo Wild Wings sauce in "Wild" flavor (which is very spicy). It had a really nice kick to it for those who like spicy.

2/11 i used 3 frozen and followed the reviewer who said slow cook on high 4 hours in chicken broth, drain, shred and add ing. and low for 2 hours.  since i used only 3 breasts, i halved the ing. and it was not enough.  VEry tasty though. make again except use all the sauce.  i used chibatta rolls and it was too doughy. try other ones next time.
1/2014: used 4 breasts, defrosted first, followed recipe exactly and way too much sauce.  high for 3 hours, shred and then back in for 1 hr on low. very good, make again. 1/16: package of thighs, and slow for 6 hours, awesome. great on soft rolls with poppy seeds and a side of cole slaw from this site.

This was a good recipe.  It had a nice tang from the italian salad dressing, I feel that sometimes just putting chicken and BBQ sauce in the slow cooker makes the chicken come out a little bitter, could be just me but oh well.  The salad dressing a thumbs up!

Followed the recipe but turned the heat setting up to high for the last two hours.  This made the chicken a bit dry so definitely will make this again but leave on the lower heat setting.   Kids loved it and very easy!

This turned out great and was very simple to make. I used fresh chicken thighs but didn't have the Italian Dressing so I used the Italian Dressing dry mix instead and sprinkled it over the chicken.  Then mixed Sweet Baby Rays BBQ Sauce with the brown sugar, Worchestire Sauce and 1 tsp of Liquid Smoke.  Cooked on high for 3 hrs, removed chicken, shredded it and removed the bones and put the shredded chicken back in the crockpot.  Added garlic powder to the mix and set on low for another hr and voila!  So delish, will definitely make it again.

This was AWESOME!  Made it just like the recipie, cooked it on high for about 3 hours then on low for about an hour, shredded the chicken and then put it on warm.  My husband loved it & my 4 yr old son liked it too.  Served it in a hot dog bun (didn't have any other rolls/buns) & put some pickles on it!!  We will enjoy the leftovers and then have it again very soon!

this was so delicious!!! I had about half bottle of bbq sauce but i added ketchup, garlic salt and a little seasoning salt along with a package of zesty ranch dry mix. It was a little thin so i added some flour and my boyfriend loved it! I served them as little sliders with honey butter refrigerated biscuits and corn! This is so good especially using frozen chicken breasts like i did! yummy thank you!!

This was so delicious and SO easy.  I only used 3 chicken breasts, and followed one of the suggestions below saying to keep all other measurements the same.  I shredded the chicken about 15 mins before eating it, and put it back in to absorb the sauce.  If I;m home earlier next time i might shred a few hrs before eating.  Also, did not eat this as a sandwich, just ate the chicken with some other side dishes.  To be honest, I couldnt really taste the addition of the italian dressing, but I guess it just thinned out the bbq sauce a little.  I also used a light italian instead of regular.  I will definitely make this again- I have the leftovers for lunch today!

I tried this recipe for the first time tonight.  It is awesome.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.  The only thing I didn't use was whe Worcestershire sauce.  I thought this was great anyway.  My wife loved it.  Thank you for sharing.

I used frozen chicken breasts and it came out fantastic in 7 hours.  So tender it shredded easily. I would make this again in a heartbeat.

Delicious! It doesn't get much easier than this recipe. Using frozen chicken is a winner! My husband and (finicky) daughter want me to replace my pulled pork recipe with this chicken dish. I have to agree. Bravo!

This sauce is great. I am going to try it with meatballs next time but I think it would be good on anything that you can put barbecue sauce on. My whole family loved it and I can't remember the last meal I cooked that at least one person in my family didn't complain about. I will definitely be saving this recipe .

Make sure to use 6 breasts, since I didn't and it was too watery.  (Plus 2 of the breasts were frozen....I think that also caused more liquid)  I liked the flavor otherwise!

Great recipe. Very easy and tasty. The sauce was a little thin, so it did require the addition of some flour. Overall, the entire family loved it! Served with sweet potato fries and salad.

I made this exactly as stated....frozen chicken breasts, ingredients, etc.  After 4 hours on high, I shredded the chicken and put it back in the crock.  Made some coleslaw and my family RAVED over it.  My husband the BBQ lover talked about it the next day!  My son came home from college and ate the end of it and was really impressed.  Even my fussy adult daughter (who doesn't like meat much) - I caught her going to make a sandwhich the next day!  I bought my college age son a crock pot and gave him this recipe.  It definitely is a keeper!  Try it!

Excellent for pulled chicken..I used Sweet Baby Rays sauce (28oz) and used the whole bottle, plus used 1 1/2 times the ingredients (I cooked more chicken)! The extra sauce was great because of the pulled chicken absorbing alot of the sauce, which ended up coating the chicken perfect. Also I ended up putting it all in the oven, only because I got a late start cooking it. Crockpot will be the next time, when Im not so last minute loosey goosey!!

I've made this recipe several times now. I   always use Sweet Baby Rae's Honey BBQ sauce (our personal favorite). The end result tastes pretty good, but I can't say that it is a "Wow" recipe.

We liked this recipe better with skinless, bone-in chicken thighs.  My wife does not like dark meat except in this recipe.  We used 4 oz of Sweet Baby's Ray's BBQ Sauce, 4 ounces of white wine (Oak Leaf pinot grigio from Wal-Mart works fine), 4 oz of Newman's Own Olive Oil & Vinegar dressing, 8 oz. of tomato sauce, two tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce and we omitted the brown sugar.  We cook one hour on high, then reduce the setting to low for four hours or until the meat is falling off the bone.  We serve over rice.  Leftovers make a nice lunch.

i tried an idea kinda like this. i had remembered some of this recipe, but didn't have time tolook it up; for dinner i threw some steak in my crock pot with some baby ray's BBQ sauce, Onion and a little water ( the water was to much liquid) and put it on low for about 6 hours. wasn't quite done when i got home. 7 hours would have been better. but it's a great recipe that you can use for almost anything! thanks for the great recipe! I served it with some toasted and buttered, thin buns! yummy! thanks

Delicious!  Ate this on buns the first day, then ate it straight when the buns were gone.  Used 5 chicken breast (non-frozen and rubbed with garlic powder).  Added 1/2 of the brown sugar, and used Jack Daniels Original #7 BBQ sauce.  It's definitely on the menu again soon!

This is a very simple thing to make and the chicken is very moist and juicy from cooking in the sauce and I love how it is very versatile by choosing what kind of roll/bun to use.

This was so easy and  my entire family- even the picky kids- loved it. Great sandwiches or you can leave out the bread and put this over mashed potatoes or rice for a great meal.

Easy and delicious.  Used a Molasses-based BBQ sauce.  Very sweet.  Will try the leftovers on a homemade chicken.  :)

This was really good.  It was a little on the soupy side, but overall I thought it was really good.  Our picky toddler who doesn't eat chicken liked it.  Made meals for the whole week since we doubled it.  Next time I might use fat free dressing to make it a little more healthy.

Not impressed with this, at all.  Honestly, I think the frozen chicken breasts are where it all goes wrong.  As they thaw I think they release too many juices that water down the bbq in both flavor and consistency.  I used a good, molasses-based bbq sauce (Famous Dave's Rich and Sassy) and you could barely taste it.  There wasn't even any color to the bbq.  I had to add a ton more for there to be any flavor at all...more than double.  Although so much easier, next time I will definitely not use frozen breasts.

All I have to say is WOW. This is Soooo good and easy. The flavor that the Italian dressing gives it w/ the brown sugar is great. We've done it with beef and the acidity helps tenderize the meat. For anyone who isn't sure what to make for lunch or supper I would say give this a try. You more than likely will have all the ingredients at hand, so great for a last minute meal.

This was my first crock pot creation. It was VERY easy to make. I left it on LOW while I was at work, when I came home, I was blown away by the smell.   I used Sweet Baby Ray's Honey Chipotle BBQ sauce which paired excellently with the italian dressing. the chicken was so tender. It was truly the best thing to make as a beginner with a crock pot. This will be a dish I make again and again.

I made this as my first crock pot attempt.  It smelled unappealing, but surprisingly turned out well.  The only substitution I made was using brown sugar Splenda instead of regular brown sugar.  I do think I used too much bbq sauce though (scaled the recipe down to 2 servings), because I had a lot of left over sauce.  I will make this again!

This was awesome! I was skeptical when it said Italian salad dressing, but it turned out great. I too added a few TBS of liquid smoke which made it even better. Instead of chicken breast, I used tenderloin because it was so much easier to shred. It was a big hit with the family!

I hate to say this, but our family of five did NOT like this at all. (Actually, my husband thought it was OK - just OK)  The barbecue was very soupy and had almost a sour, pungent taste.  I'm very sad because I was totally geeked about just throwing frozen chicken breasts and a few ingredients in a crock pot and having BBQ chicken sandwiches for dinner.  Oh, well.

Pretty good and couldn't be any easier. After a few hours of cooking I shredded the chicken and returned it to the crock pot to hang out in the sauce. Next time I'll either use more chicken or less sauce, as I think it's a too saucy as written. But tasty and made a good football lunch.

I love to cook, but I love easy days when I can throw something in my slow cooker. I followed the recipe at first, but after 3 1/2 hours on high, I took the chicken out, shredded it up, seasoned it with garlic powder, pepper, and a dash of paprika. I put it back in the sauce in the crock pot and added some extra barbecue sauce that I had. It turned out great! It was served with corn on the cob and mashed potatoes. Tomorrow's lunch will be the "barbecue chicken" on buns. Yum! :)

Great recipe! Super easy to make - followed others advice: put some Alpine Touch (spice mixture) on the chicken first, used a whole bottle of Jack Daniels BBQ Sauce; after 4 hours on low shredded the chicken; put on high for another two minutes. Made plenty so will freeze!

Excellent recipe, the sauce is fantastic, even my fiance loved it and he is picky when it comes to shredded meat.  We had leftovers and ate them for 2 days after they were so good.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because of the recommendation of using frozen chicken.  I used fresh chicken and cooked on high for 4 hours.  I might try cooking it on low for 6 hours next time.  I also liked previous recommendations of adding liquid smoke but overall recipe is absolutely delicious the way it is.

Yum!  I followed the other reviewer's advice and cooked it on low for 3 hours, took the chicken out, shredded it and put it back in for another hour on high.  I served it on Hawaiian rolls with mashed potatoes and baked beans.

I used the suggestions from Cooking 101.  I took three boneless chicken breasts and rubbed garlic powder, salt and pepper on them.  I placed them in the crock-pot for about 5-6 hrs on low.  I shredded the chicken and drained the grease.  I then added the BBQ sauce mixture and added it to the chicken and cooked another 1-2 hours on low.  I used Jack Daniels bbq sause w/ brown sugar.  I used the meat as a topping on my loaded baked potatos, and they were wonderful.

Always looking for good slow cooker recipes and this is great.  Made as is and it turned out excellent.  Unfortunately I don't get to make it that often because my husband does not like barbecue flavor.

I just made this for my husband and I...it is soo good! I definatly recommend this recipe, and its very easy to make.   The only thing i added to it was diced onions and i seasoned the chicken with some garlic pepper before cooking it. But other than that the recipe is perfect! :)

Meat was very tender and it tasted great! I would recommend setting it to a lower tempeture for a longer period of time. We cooked it about 10 hours (while we were at work) on low and it was perfect.

I used 3 fresh whole chicken breasts and then followed the rest of the recipe exactly as is...AMAZING!! I think it cooked on low for 5 or 6 hours. I used tongs and the meat just fell apart. Soooo good. It's been less than a week since I made it and my husband is begging me to make it again for dinner tonight!!

The was my first attempt at slow cooker food - loved it! I added some shallots and garlic for the extra kick and for the health benefits. Thanks for the recipe!

SOOOOOO MELT IN YOUR MOUTHWATERING DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!! ok, so i changed the servings to 3... only added 1 TBS brown sugar, cuz family doesn't like it too sweet.  Plus I added 1 TBS minced garlic, cuz, we love it. I also buttered the Kaiser rolls to toast them under the broiler.  I also took the breast out, shredded and put back in 1 hour b4 serving.  MY HUBBY VERY PICKY! BUT EVERYONE LOOOOOVED THIS!!!! will DEFINITELY MAKE AGAIN!!  I'm going to follow another reviewer and make pizza tomorrow from the leftovers :) Thanks so much for sharing your incredible recipe :)

This was really good and SO easy! I used Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce and also added onions/garlic since my family likes them. I shredded the chicken once it had cooked and then put it all back in the crock pot for another hour! YUMM! Served these on slider buns for a huge tail-gating party and they were gone before the game even started!

We all agreed this was really good.I served it on hamburger buns and it made great barbecue sandwiches.I shredded the chicken about an hour before serving and it thickened right up.I used Sweet Baby Rays barbecue sauce but I had to use balsamic vinaigrette instead of Italian...it was still really good.I will definately save this recipe and make it again.

Used fresh chicken breasts and cooked on high for 3 hours, shredded, then cooked on low for an hour.  Meat was very tender and moist.  Used Jack Daniels original BBQ sauce and end sauce was tangy and delicious!

I didn't really like the italian dressing in it. The oil floating in the sauce grossed me out. I would probably only make it again with bbq sauce only.

I used fresh chicken breasts, not frozen. (In fact, I'm just now seeing they were supposed to be frozen!)  I also used Sweet Baby Rays bbq sauce, FF Zesty Italian Salad Dressing, and Splenda brown sugar.  I also think this makes way more than 6 servings...maybe 12?  Tastes really good on a bun with coleslaw.

This was really good! My family gobbled it up. Only difference was that I didn't make it in the crock-pot. I shredded an already cooked rotisserie chicken and cooked it on the stove with the BBQ sauce, brown sugar and Worcestershire. I skipped the italian dressing. Put it on little dinner rolls to make sliders. Yum!

Used 8 frozen chicken tender breasts.  Cooked on high for about 3.5 hours.  Would like to have cooked it longer, but it was fine.  Next time I would use more chicken, since there was lots of sauce.  The next night we made BBQ Chicken Pizza on wheat dough from Trader Joe's.  We just added slivered red onions and plenty of moz cheese.  I give the pizza five stars. Will def make this recipe again.

After reading a lot of the reviews, I decided to cook the chicken breasts in chicken broth for several hours.  Then I drained the juice, shredded the chicken and returned it to the crockpot.  Then I added the sauce mixture and cooked for another 1-2 hours.  This was fantastic and so easy to make.  The sauce was delicious.

This was great and so easy! I followed the recipe exactly and followed others' advice about shredding at about 4 hours and then cooking longer. A real hit here with the family. I served it with a slice of horseradish cheddar cheese on hard rolls. Corn on the cob was a great side.

Made as recipe advises; used Sweet Ray's honey chipotle BBQ sauce.  It was okay; 11-yr old daughter loved it (I had to use 3 napkins!) and husband liked it.  I thought it was okay.  Served on potato buns.

I love this recipe!! It is so quick and easy to just through in the crock pot on my way out the door in the morning. I have tried a couple of different barbeque sauces and the best is Jack Daniels Original. I have made it for my boyfriend and his buddies and there is never any leftovers.

Something went wrong for me with this one.  The sauce tasted great at first, but I don't think the slow cooker helped it at all.  My chicken came out stringy. If I had saved some uncooked sauce to mix in I think I could have salvaged it.

easy and delicious.  I make it with 4 breasts (because I like runny sauce) and no worcestershire (because I don't have any).  I use Sweet Baby Ray's sauce: 8 oz. honey chipotle and 4 oz. either honey BBQ or classic BBQ.  yum!

I love to cook esp with a slow cooker and the slow cooker chicken recipe I have is good but needed some umph :) So when I saw that italian dressing was an ingredient I thought..it might be what I was looking for.  So I put in 4 chicken breasts in the slow cooker BUT I poured in 4-5 cups boiling water, 3 chicken bouillon cubes, 2 clove minced garlic and seasoned the chicken with garlic pepper salt and a chicken seasoning. (no bbq sauce) Cooked it on low for 3 hrs.  I drained the chicken juices and fat into a separate bowl (will explain why later) and shredded the chicken and THEN added the recommended sauce along with 2 TBS petite diced onion, 2 minced garlic cloves and 1 TBS cornstarch (I tasted the chicken before I added it back to the empty crock pot and it tasted good :)  I let it cook on low for 2 hrs and then turned it off. THIS was amazing!  We all enjoyed it thoroughly! I decided that I didn't want to use 2 bottles of our Head County BBQ sauce (local restaurant) so that's why I decided to cook as I did PLUS (and now I'll explain why I reserved the juices) the remaining juices I poured over my dog's food so he could enjoy it too. If I disposed of the fat and bbq sauce as most recommended and then add again, I would've wasted sauce and my dog would've been sad lol  I gave it 4 stars bc you really need to drain the sauce. But I think mine gets 5! Also the BBQ sauce we use is sweet and we like a little kick with our so I used ZESTY italian dressing and it was wonderful!

This was very good and very easy, two of my favorite ways to cook.  I fixed it for the grandkids and they all liked it as well.  Edit - this time I used chicken quarters.  Tastes just as good but at a fraction of the cost.  When the meat was falling off the bone, I deboned and then returned to the crock pot.  I made Belles Hamburger Buns and Bada Bing Bada Bang Potatoes to go with it, and garden salad.  Yum Yum Yum.

I found this recipes on here when I discovered, last minute, that we were expecting company for dinner. I had chicken drumsticks in the freezer and not enough time to thaw them, cook and prepare for company. Thanks to this recipe, which we have enjoyed many times since, our evening was a great success and our guests LOVED the chicken. It is now a special request from our children, family and friends. I have always used frozen chicken drumsticks and serve it with rice (we put the remaining sauce on our rice). YUMMY!!!

This is a really good, easy recipe for those busy days.  Made this a few days ago, put it on some great rolls with coleslaw.  A great, easy recipe.

SO GOOD! I followed the recipe exactly and added a few garlic cloves & a splash of hot sauce. The main photo inspired me to do a kind of Cuban themed meal, so I served the chicken over coconut basmati rice (replace some of the H20 with a small jar of coconut milk & add a bit of salt/creole seasoning) with black beans and avocado on the side. DELICIOUS. I will be making this repeatedly!

Very, very simple to make - I liked that.  It was a good sauce.  Just tasted like a really good barbecue sauce, though.  Nothing extraordinary.  But I loved the ease of making it versus a whole chicken or pork.

I made this tonight for dinner. Everyone loved it. My husband (who loves BBQ) said it tasted just like the pulled chicken in the BBQ joints he likes. My mom and sister also had it and asked for the recipe. My my brother in law liked it and he doesn't even like chicken. My nephew liked it and he doesn't like BBQ sauce all that much. It went over very well. I will keep using this one. Not to mention it's very easy. I did use a whole 18oz. bottle of BBQ sause though. (Sweet Baby Rays hickory and brown sugar) yum

Super easy and delicious!  I used drumsticks and thighs and followed the rest of the ingredients list as described.  I kept it on Low for 5 hours, then added a tablespoon or 2 of flour to thicken the sauce (as others suggested).  The house smelled great when we came home from the kids activities tonight.  About 6-7 hours total cooking time - could go a little less.  The kids loved it!

I made this one night while at my mothers..It got great reviews and was super easy so I figured I make it at our upcoming family reunion for about 20 people!  It went over fantastic!  Everyone was asking me for the recipe!  Even my finicky 8 yr old cousin ate it!  I paired it with coleslaw, corn bread casserole and green bean casserole (all recipes found on here).  Dinner that night was a hit!  I plan on making this again when my in laws visit next month!

Really good and so easy. I loved not even having to defrost the chicken breasts. Great on a hot summer day since I didn't have to heat up my kitchen. I did spice it up a little with some hot sauce and some bar b q  seasoning. We all really liked this. Will make again. Thanks!

Made as written except I added a some chopped onion near the end, and a TBS of liquid smoke.  Other reviewers are correct- the chicken will absorb most of the liquid after it is done and you shred it.  We served on whole wheat buns the first night, then the second night we made pizza with BBQ sauce instead of tomato sauce, and pineapple chunks.

A friend cooked this recipe one night for our "ladies night" and I just fell in love.  I then cooked it for my family and it was such a hit.  The biggest fan was my 15 month old nephew!  I used Jack Daniels Honey Smokehouse bbq sauce, and fresh chicken breasts.

Needs doctoring up, but it's a good simple bbq.  I agree that the sauce makes a difference.  I used Hunts BBq but added Montreal Steak BBQ sauce too, and hot sauce.

I made this today for dinner and it was a hit.  I only have 4 chicken breast so I used about 8 oz of sweet bbq sauce. Cooked on high for 3hrs then shredded chicken.  I cooked for about another 30mins after that.  Once complete I put chicken on a kaiser roll and sprinkled provolone cheese on and put in toaster over to melt cheese and toast bun.  Excellent sandwich.  Thanks for sharing!

I followed advise given by MWT on Oct. 3. I used sweet Baby Rays Honey BBQ Sauce & added 1/2 C of diced onions - I made the recipe with 2 lbs. of boneless pork ribs in place of the chicken & didn't shred - ate as rib dinner. Everything else I kept exactly as shown. This recipe was AWESOME! If I  could rate this as a 10...I would! My family & company scarfed it down like piggies. Everyone wanted this recipe. I must say, I was concerned with the taste of using the Italian Dressing, but SO very glad I did! I used Wish Bone Fat Free Italian Dressing. Delicious! Thank You for this family favorite!

This recipe was great, everyone at my cookout enjoyed it. One quote I loved was "This chicken is off the hook."   I made a double batch to feed everyone, and had two different barbeque sauces - Jack Daniels and K.C. Masterpiece. I probably added a bit more Worcestershire sauce than the recipe called for, but other than that I followed it exactly.

Cooked the chicken breasts in chicken broth and seasoned them with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Once cooked - shredded and added the sauce mixture. Cooked on low for another 30 minutes. DELICIOUS!

This is a HIT!!  When I took the chicken out to shred it, I also removed some of the sauce because it seems like a lot. Before I added the chicken back in, I disolved 1 TBSP cornstarch in water and then stirred into sauce left in crockpot to thicken.  I put the chicken back in and added enough of the sauce I removed to make it juicy but not overly so.

Super easy, can't mess it up (if you use a bbq sauce that you love).  Even with a spicy bbq sauce I found this a little lacking in spice.  Will definitely make again with my own sauce.  I used thawed chicken and it cooked on low for 8 hours and was still very moist.  Kids loved it.

Awesome recipe!  I tweaked it a little and didn't add all my bbq sauce only half.  Cooked for about 5 hours on low and drained it and added the other half of bbq sauce.  It was moist and delish!

I really liked this recipe. I used Baby Ray's sauce and Wish Bone dressing. The sauce was a bit thinner than I wanted so I took it and the chicken and cooked it in an open skillet until it was as thick as I wanted. (it only took about 20 minutes.) Delicious, reminded me of the barbecue my mother made!

I had 6 fresh chicken breasts I needed to do something with and found this recipe - never thought to use my slow cooker. What a great idea!  I didn't have Italian dressing so I just used 2 kinds of barbeque sauce - one honey/garlic and the other had a smoky flavor.  Layered the breasts in the slow cooker and poured the sauce over. Also added about half an onion finely chopped and the brown sugar.  It was fabulous!!  I noticed the onion disentegrated and melded into the chicken  during cooking, so next time I think I'll also finely chop some red pepper with it.  Used the cooking time of the recipe and the chicken fell apart by moving it around with a fork - I didn't need to pull it.  VERY tender.  I did find that it needed a little kick so next time I'll make sure to have the italian dressing and maybe use a little hot sauce.  Used it on buns like the photo in the recipe, then used the left overs several ways....with grilled veggies in wraps, in fried rice, and made a sandwich for my daughter's lunch.  Love the versatility of this recipe - I'm going to always have some made up on hand in the freezer.

We love this recipe.  It could not be easier!  So far I have only used fresh chicken breasts, but I can't wait to try it with frozen too.  I use Montgomery Inn BBQ sauce (Kroger sells it) because it reminds me of home!  Yummy!

This was fantastic.  I used Sweet Baby Rays as suggested by another review.  I also used fresh chicken breast and put them in the crock pot on high for an hour, and then shredded the chicken and left it for a little while longer to marinate.  We served on whole wheat rolls with pickles, and extra sauce. Yummy!

This is my go-to recipe when I am going to be gone all day and need to make a quick dinner.  Everyone in the family loves it.  The chicken is juicy and tender and shreds effortlessly.  I usually even use fat-free Italian dressing because that is what I keep in the fridge.  I don't even measure anymore, just dump the ingredients in and it turns out great every time!

Really good, and I'm not usually wild about bbq.  I put two frozen breasts in with about half a beer, slow cooked on low for about 5 hours, drained the beer out, shredded the chicken and added the other ingredients, but left out the sugar.  Also threw in some garlic powder, onion powder, and pepper.  Two chicken breasts (about one lb of chicken total) made three big sandwiches for us and a lot of extra nibbles out of the crock pot.
Edited 5/27: Here we are four days later, and my boyfriend is already asking me to make this again. It's that good!

Very good, but not healthy at all.. this is a way to really pack chicken w/ sweet bbq & sugar.  If you didn't shred and throw back in you wouldn't absorb nearly as much.

I am a one-serving kind of girl, but I ate two sandwiches in no time at all! My three-year-old son said, "It's delicious, Mommy! I like it!" I used 3 chicken breasts (shredded), and every bit of my sauce was soaked up. This is a new family favorite!

Excellent! My husband, who was born and raised in Memphis said it was one of the best barbecue sandwiches he's ever had.  We served it on a bun with homemade Memphis- style slaw. The recipe is perfect as written- used a full bag of Wal-Mart's boneless skinless chicken breasts, and for the barbecue sauce I used Jack Daniels' Original.

Our family is now addicted to this recipe!  I agree with previous readers and use a decent sauce.  We use Sweet Baby Rays which is only about $1.50 a bottle on sale and it works great in this recipe.  After the chicken is almost done-I shred the chicken and put it back in the crock on low for 20 minutes or so.  I also add sliced onion-on my this is a great recipe!

This was an awesome recipe.  It tasted as if a lot of effort was put forth into making.  But in realty a few simple ingredients made this a hit.  I used 4 thawed chicken breasts, added a teaspoon of liquid smoke, and shredded the breasts once tender.  Served with buns, sweet potato fries, and & a garden salad.  Looking forward to having left overs for lunch this afternoon.  Thanks for sharing!

What a fantastic and EASY as pie way to use FROZEN chicken breasts we all have in the freezer!  Love this one-a great Sunday crockpot recipe.  I recommend shredding the chicken and making pulled sandwiches with the DELICIOUS sauce that stews all day in the crock.  Don't forget to refrigerate the extra sauce and use it for sandwiches with the rest of the chicken-seriously good and easy pulled sandwiches are yours any day of the week, winter or summer!

I made this & it was a hit with the entire family! I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce. The only adjustment I made was to add some Chipotle Pepper..maybe about a Tablespoon. I like a bit of smoke with my BBQ. I didn't use froze chicken breast either. Cooked on low for about 5 hours, shredded chicken and continued to cook on low for 2 additional hours. Delish!!

This was terrific!  My Hubby and I enjoyed it very much.  We ate it atop Texas Toast as a open faced Sandwich.  We put it in the slow cooker in the morning before heading out and when we returned it smelled just wonderful.  I will make this again and again.  I think next time i might try it on top of nachos.  I am smiling just thinking about it haha.

I'm not a fan of sweet food generally speaking so the first time I made this I was tempted to leave the brown sugar out... DON'T. Also, I've experimented with using dry Italian salad dressing mix instead of the pre-made, DON'T. I agree with another poster on the quality of sauce you use, if you do not use good sauce you will not get great results.

Very yummy recipe! I would probably do less Italian dressing next time, though. Too much zest, not enough BBQ.

This was fantastic! I made it as is the first time, and it was absolutely delicious. The second time, I had an issue with my crockpot that caused it to burn the chicken. Now my third time I used the honey barbecue sauce recipe found on the site for the barbecue sauce, just used cheap Italian dressing and put it in my new crockpot with a little bit of onion and some anaheim pepper and left it for four hours and came back and shredded it. DELICIOUS.

This was so easy and great... I shredded the chicken the last hour of cooking, and added a mixture of cornstarch and water to thicken the sauce.

Good stuff. I didn't have any chicken breast so I used 2 small cornish game hens.  Not my brightest idea because pulling all the skin and bones out after cooking wasn't easy.  But it was worth it in the end and tasted great.

Juicy and tender! I used frozen boneless skinless chicken breasts and cooked on low for 6.5 hours.  I used Bill Johnson's BBQ Sauce. It was so very flavorful. I'll keep experimenting with different BBQ Sauces.

Wow, this is the easiest barbecue I've ever made! I only gave it 4 stars because the chicken was a little dry. Next time, I will boil and shred the chicken before I put it in the slow cooker so it can really take on the flavor of the sauce. yum!!!!

Good, but I couldn't really taste any difference between using just my regular BBQ sauce (bottled KFC Masterpiece Hickory Brown Sugar) and the sauce plus additives.

It was good.  I shredded it and served it on rice.  I think a warm sandwich would have been better.  It didn't taste overly healthy for me.

Honestly, I'm not a huge fan of barbecue, and I thought this recipe sounded kind of weird, but I tried it and I'm glad I did. It's seriously good. So good, in fact, that this is the first recipe I've ever bothered to write a review for. Plus, it's super easy, which makes it even better!

Wow! Super easy and turned out great. I also used 1/2 bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's Honey barbecue sauce, but was a bit too sweet for me. Next time will try with a more zesty n savory BBQ sauce. To thicken the sauce, I whisked 1/4c more BBQ sauce with 1 tbs cornstarch, then poured it in.  The heat cooked the cornstarch and thickened it all pretty well.

I would recommend that you put in 1 tablespoon instead of 2 of brown sugar, it was just a little too sweet.

Super great recipe! Easy to make, and tasty and juicy. I did not have italian dressing, so I added 1 tsp of dried oregeno. 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp onion powder, 1 tbsp molasses, 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar, 1 strip of bacon.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was a huge success! My husband said he wished he had 4 more pieces! It was so easy to make (I didn't prepare the sauce, just poured all the ingredients in the crock pot and stirred it up a bit). I used the extra sauce over a baked potato. Delicious!

This was a recipe that I will not be making again.  The chicken came out dry and uneatable.  Try cutting down on the cooking time and there is no way I would put the sauce on my potatos, it had all kinds of white stuff floating in it, the stuff you boil out of a  chicken, when you boil a chicken, and throw away.  My husband and I opted for a pizza instead!

I used Kraft Hickory Smoked BBQ sauce and since it's a sweeter sauce anyway, only put 2 tbsp of brown sugar in.  I used 3 thawed chicken breasts and cooked it on High for 3 1/2 hours.  I ended up using a whole 18 oz. bottle of BBQ sauce, but that was because I knew that it was going to end up sitting on warm for awhile (my husband ended up having to work late last minute). This is a keeper!

This barbecue chicken is wonderful.  It smells amazing as well.  I usually half the recipe for my husband and myself.  We usually can get a few meals out of it even when we half it.  We've had it plain, on sandwiches, on salads, and on baked potatoes.  The only way I do not recommend is over the baked potatoes.  It just wasn't that great of a combination.

This was pretty good and fell apart. The bbq sauce did burn a little bit, but it wasn't a major problem. Will probably make again another time

Really good flavor if you tweak the recipe like everyone said. I used a little more brown sugar and used a good quality barbeque sauce and mine turned out great.  Just a warning. This makes a lot of food, so if you are cooking for two scale it way down.

I cooked this on low for 8 hours as instructed, and the chicken was severely overcooked. The sauce got overcooked as well and turned into a very thick syrup. This might work if it's cooked for a shorter period of time, but as the recipe stands now, definitely not a keeper.

I was amazed at how good this was.  I really was skeptical about the Italian dressing, but it really made a fantastic sauce.  I used 1/2 Sweet Baby Rays and 1/2 Open Pit.  It was fantastic!

It was simple to make and my family liked it.  It was rated a 4 from my daughter since she said it is not the best thing she ever ate.....so it gets a 4.  I used Kraft zesty italian and Sweet baby rays award winning sauce.  I will not add the brown sugar next time because I thought it was a bit too sweet. Thanks for this quick and lo fat meal.

Seeing reviews which state this recipe is dry leads me to believe that folks don't know their crockpots. If your crockpot doesn't have a probe, it really is worth your time to use a meat thermometer and determine how long it takes for meat to fully cook in your crockpot. You might be surprised.  I used Cooking101's revisions but used four (4) full breasts on the bone; thawed NEVER FROZEN. For this quantity of meat I used an entire 28 oz. bottle of Jack Daniel's Original No. 7, 1/2 C Newman's Own Family Recipe Italian, and 1/2 C brown sugar. Next time I will use a zestier Italian dressing, as the NOFR added nothing to the dish (which is why I increased the BBQ sauce).  I served on browned Honey Wheat Kaiser rolls with sauteed green beans and sweet potato fries. All the kids, ages 3 - 11 ate it without complaint.

OMG! This was wonderful! I used 6 fresh boneless, skinless breasts instead of frozen. Cooked on high for 3 hours (fall apart tender) took them out and shredded. Placed back in on low for another 45 minutes. Perfect BBQ chicken! A definite keeper.

This was absolutely delicious - I followed the recipe rather closely although I did add onions and some liquid smoke to the mix.  I must say, it is the best crock pot recipe I have made so far!

This was a very easy quick dinner to make in a hurry. I was able to throw everything in the crockpot run errands and dinner was pretty much ready when I came home. It had a good flavor to it. I had mine shredded on a bun and my husband ate his chicken whole.

This has been an absolute winner in our household.  I have made it many times and it is always a hit.  Throw it all in the pot and come home from work and it is done.  You do need to shred the meat a bit before serving.  We love it on wheat hamburger buns!  Kids love it!  I do add extra meat - 2-3 extra chicken breast halves because there is quite a bit liquid

This was excellent!!  We were not able to eat it the day it was prepared, so I had to heat it up. It was amazing.  I did add a diced onion as per other reviews. I served it with brown rice and peas. The only issue hubby had was there was not enough. (I changed and prepared for a serving of 2) Will try the sauce as pulled pork.dish next time.  This is a definate 'do'er again'

This was sooooo good!  I made it according to the recipe except I used 4 chicken breasts (because that was all I had) instead of 6 and it turned out great.  The sauce is watery when you first take the cooked chicken out of the crockpot, but I found once you shred the chicken and add it back to the sauce the meat absorbs the liquid very quickly.  The end result is not watery at all and tastes better than any restaurant barbecued chicken I've ever had!

This recipe was amazing except for one fix. The salad dressing made it too oily. I would suggest adding some dry italian dressing mix and a dollop of extra BBQ sauce to replace the liquid. I overcooked this recipe and the taste was still delicious!

This recipe is the bomb!  I used 3 chicken breasts but kept the sauce ingredients the same, simply because I thought too much sauce would be better than not enough.  I used frozen breasts, and cooked on HIGH for 3 hours, removed and shredded chicken, and place back in pot for 1 more hour on LOW.  I used frozen breasts and after 3 hours on high it shredded beautifully and was super moist and perfectly cooked.  My husband inhaled this!  The whole family loved it.  This one will be part of the regular rotation. Super fast prep, no fuss, perfect results.

love, love, love this!  I used frozen chicken breasts, Sweet Baby Rays original bbq sauce, and threw in one bell pepper-since it needed to be used up.  Cooked it in the crockpot all day, shredded the chicken, and served it on hoagie rolls.  So easy and so good!

Made this with Cliff's Texas BBQ Sauce (the best sauce ever!) and it was excellent.  Next time, I'll double the sauce ingredients - when you shred the chicken, all the sauce gets sucked up!

Very good sauce!!  I served over baked potatoes as in the picture and the entire family raved.  I reserved about 1/3 or so of the sauce in the fridge and after cooking on high for 4 hours, shredded the chicken, drained what was in the crock pot and added the fresh sauce and pulled chicken back in.  Cooked on high for another half hour or so and it was a winner!

very yummy!  I used 3 frozen chicken breast in a regualr package, then 3 of the individually frozen chicken breast.  The ones in the regualr packaging were must more moist...  I also used Zesty Italian dressing since thats all I had on hand.  Turned out great, even my pickiest eaters had seconds!!

I followed the recipe and the comments and served two special guests at my home this week.  It was a hit and served exactly 4 persons.  I put it on a bed of rice and it was outstanding.  This recipe is a keeper thank you for this.

We tried this a couple nights ago. Followed the recipe exactly, except used about 18oz of barbeque sauce instead of 12. Served over baked potatoes. It was perfect and delicious! My husband couldn't get enough of it and his brother came over and loves it too. We will definitely have this on a regular basis!

Yum-OOOO! Mixed up Good Seasons Italian Dressing for my Italian dressing and used Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce. I put about 5# fresh chicken breasts in the slow cooker, poured the sauce over, shredded the chicken after about 6 hours and then let it cook for another 1 1/2. It was possibly the BEST BBQ sauce ever! I will use this sauce recipe for pork as well! Kudos to the origional poster!

Really loved this...also a tad too sweet for me. Maybe change up the ratio of the ingredients with the chix but very good.

Wonderful! The sauce did thicken for me on it's own. I will make this many, many times!! I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce, which is already a bit thick by itself, so I wouldn't reccomend a very thin bbq sauce. The Sweet Baby Ray's gave it the perfect texture. Highly reccomended!!

This Chicken was great. I agree that what makes it good is the type of Barbecue sauce you use. We will definitely make this again and try serving it over rice.

SOOOO Good!  I did add one huge diced onion and five cloves of garlic smashed.  It is an excellent recipe.  I used Bullseye original bbq sauce.  It has the highest ratings in Cooks Illustrated.

This recipe is a great simple but slightly different slow cooker recipe.  But its all about adapting it to the  size of your slow-cooker (mine is very wide so you need a lot more sauce to ensure all chicken breasts are covered and not dried out).

We liked this.  It was a little different from what I expected it to be.  I was surprised at how well sour cream topped this off (as we used it on potatoes).  The sour cream gave it a really rich and creamy taste.  We'll have this again, I'm sure.

Tasty, easy bbq chicken. I've made this twice and and it came out great both times. I only cook it for about 4 hours so that the chicken doesn't dry out. I shred it after about 3 hours and then serve over baked potatoes. Serve with sour cream, shredded cheese, diced onions, etc.

Very good recipe. My husband actually prefers this over our pulled pork sandwiches. The only differnce I did is I used the whole bottle of my Jack Daniel's BBQ sauce which was 16oz. I also after and hour and half of cooking just the chicken with some water on high, drained the fat from the dish, then continued cooking for another 6.5 hours on low with the then added sauce.

Oh my gosh! This was so good!! My husband said that it tasted like "restaurant quality" barbecue. I made a few changes for what I had on hand. I only used 4 chicken breast halves that were fresh that I cooked on low for about 5 hours. I then shredded and put back in to cook for about an hour more. I used Jack Daniel's original recipe and it was delicious! I also threw in some chopped onion and some molasses. I served with corn on the cob. This will be a regular in my house!

Really good! I used trader joes spicy bbq sauce and fat-free italian dressing. I put it in the crockpot for 6 hours on low. I added slightly more sauce than called for. Really really delicious!

The idea was great...used "Sweet Baby Ray's " BBQ sauce. cooked on high then low in crock pot~ chicken dried out on me! Was totally edible but should have turned it off about an hour or two before I did. Good flavor.

I add about 1/4 C apple cider vinegar, about 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper and about 1 tsp liquid smoke. From another suggestion.  Turned out amazingly good.  Definetly making this again!

We made this using Kraft Hickory Smoked BBQ sauce, and Kraft Tuscan House Italian salad dressing. It turned out AMAZING! We added about 1/2 cup more salad dressing than requested, and 1/3 cup chicken broth. 30 min before serving, we pulled the chicken breasts out and shredded them, then placed the chicken back in the slow cooker for the remaining 30 min. To serve we placed the shredded chicken in ciabatta bread, and used the remaining sauce for dipping. Will be made again real soon!

Very tasty!  I used a whole fresh chicken that I skinned and cut into pieces. I also added 1/2 of a chopped onion, 3 cloves chopped garlic and 1 TBSP white distilled vinegar.  After about 5 hours, I removed the chicken from the bones, shredded it and returned it to the pot. I turned the heat to high and cooked without the lid to thicken the sauce for about 2 hours, stirring occasionally. A family hit!

Made this for lunch today.  Followed the recipe, except thawed the chicken a little bit before putting in the crockpot.  I also shredded the chicken when done and let it continue to cook for about an hour.  We put the chicken mixture on top of baked potatoes...yum!  Will make this again.  So easy too!

So tasty!!!!  I used another's suggestion and made sure that I used a BBQ sauce without vinegar.  I actually used Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce.  I put the finished product on a good roll with caramelized red onions and American cheese (I know, I know... but it really melted and combined well with the chicken!)

Very good and tasty recipe.  We ate it on rolls and then later made a pizza with it.  Next time, I'll lessen the cooking time and reduce the amount of brown sugar.  My chicken was a bit overcooked, but there was enough sauce that it wasn't dry.  I'll make it again with a few changes.

My husband and I love this recipe! It's so easy and tastes delicious. We use our favorite barbecue sauce instead of what the recipe calls for. So tasty!

It was good, but there was too much sauce.  I did have to thicken it at the end of cooking.  I used a whole chicken (not cut up), and just put the whole chicken in the slow cooker and poured the sauce over it.  At the end of the cooking time, I just pulled the bones out. I used Carolina Classic barbecue sauce, and served it with mashed potatoes, but it would also be good on rolls, or over baked potatoes.  I didn't see that the Italian dressing and sugar added much to the flavor, and I'll probably leave them out next time, and just use half the bottle of barbecue sauce while it's cooking.  I can always add the rest of the bottle when it's finished cooking, if it needs more.

This was terrific! I used fresh chicken -- Harvestland all-natural chicken breasts, which are big and plump so I used only 5. Besides that, I used the exact directions, with 12 ounces of Michelbobs bbq sauce and some no-name Italian dressing (didn't think it would matter; I was right). I followed Audrea Rose's suggestion and cooked the chicken for 3 hours on high, then shredded it and cooked for one hour on low. Then I drained it a little in a colander and made a sandwich. Totally delicious. Thanks!

This was good.  I for sure pulled it and served it with mashed potatos.  It was so easy...  i coated each piece of chicken with olive oil and garlic salt before putting in pot.  I did not use fresh parsley as I was too lazy, so the dryied was just fine.  I used Snubbs BBQ sause.

UPDATE: I REALLY WANTED TO GIVE THIS A SECOND TRY (WHO DOESN'T LIKE BBQ CHICKEN???). THE TRICK IS TO FOLLOW ZANE'S RECIPE EXACTLY AND COOK NO LONGER THAN 4 HOURS ON HIGH (OR THE EQUIVALENT AMOUNT OF TIME ON LOW). IT IS CRITICAL THAT YOU DON'T OVERCOOK YOUR CHICKEN (DRY CHICKEN = YUCK!). I HAVE ALSO NOTICED THAT THE TEXTURE OF FROZEN (COOKED) MEAT IS NEVER AS GOOD AS FRESH, BUT THAT'S JUST MY OPINION. :) MY FINAL OBSERVATION IS THAT THE ADDITIONAL INGREDIENTS ADDED TO A GOOD QUALITY BBQ SAUCE MAKE NO DIFFERENCE (I COULD BARELY DETECT THEM). IF YOU HAVE THEM HANDY, ADD THEM. IF NOT, SKIP THE "EXTRAS" AND JUST ADD A LITTLE MORE BBQ SAUCE TO COMPENSATE. THIS IS NOW WORTHY OF A REPEAT PERFORMANCE. This was allright. I guess I just don't care for slow cooked chicken because it ALWAYS turns out dry - and this time was no exception (my chicken was so dry, it literally crumbled). :( Having said this, I did make a few changes. As Cooking 101 did, I too cooked my seasoned chicken in broth FIRST (6 hours on low setting). When my fiance and I returned from the zoo, I removed and shredded my chicken, drained the broth, mixed with the sauce ingredients (FYI, I used Famous Dave's rich & sassy BBQ sauce) and cooked another 2 hours. I served our BBQ "spuds-style" as Zane suggested with fresh corn on the cobb, baked beans & garlic bread on the side. Thanks for sharing, Zane :)

I followed this recipe exactly, and did not care much for the chicken, the breasts seemed very dry even though they were in the juices....however if you pull the chicken apart it totally changes it into delicious. One little note the recipe calls for 1 (12 oz) bottle bbq sauce. I could not find a 12 oz. bottle of sauce so it had to be measured, it may be possible to just use 18 oz. with no problem.

Excellent recipe and so easy to throw together! I thickened the sauce so it would stay with the chicken on the ciabatta rolls, and served with sliced onions & sliced cheese. Low fat and delicious!

You would have thought this chicken had been grilled, it was so good.  My husband and I could smell the sauce as the day wore on and this kept us waiting until the time we could eat.

Yummy sandwiches!  I shredded the chicken and served on kaiser buns toasted with butter and garlic salt.  Like others, I thought it seemed a little bit watery when it was done, so I removed the lid for about 15 or so min. prior to serving and it worked!  The sauce to chicken ratio was perfect.  I've tried other versions of bbq chicken in the crock pot but hubby said that he likes this one the best!  Served with Apple Cole Slaw and Baked Zucchini Chips.

This recipes was very good...in many ways. I found the recipe last night, and took everything out this morning. I had to work so I left it all on the top shelf of the refridgerator. My husband however had the day off. I leave for work at 6:30 in the morning and do not get home until about 6:00, so it would have definitely been over cooked. I emailed him all of the instructions. However, I did not add the brown sugar that the recipe calls for. I did use sweet baby rays brown sugar and hickory sauce. This was great. The taste was great and it was even easy for my husband to throw together. I did shred the chicken when I got home and added a little more sauce. I let it sit while I prepared the rice.

Absolutely delicious!  Followed recipe using Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce, slicing an onion and instead of chicken, used boneless pork ribs.  Served over rice.  Very good recipe - worth trying.

I made this for a large birthday party.  It was a wonderful hit!  I used 7 boneless/skinless chicken breasts and added 1/2 chopped onion to the sauce.  Everyone raved.  I will be making again for the next large group I need to feed.

WOW!  I made this for the second time today.  The first time it was just me and my husband and we had leftovers for three days...that was too much, ha ha, even though it was delicous!  (I served it on baked potato, then red rice, then soft rolls.  Preferred the rolls.  I'm feeding three men and three women tonight, including myself and there will be plenty to go around.  Serving over rice and mixed veggies, with biscuits on the side, to ensure the diners can sop up that incredible sauce!  I added half a chopped onion about an hour before the chicken was done cooking.  I 'pulled' it about two hours before it was done.  I cooked it for eight hours total.  Don't worry, the sauce thickens!  I used Kraft Hickory BBQ Sauce, an entire bottle and added a very generous amount of fresh ground pepper (a must in almost everything I cook).  My Mom, who is VERY picky about what she eats (and who cooks it, ha ha), got to sample this dish a few moments ago and she LOVED it.  Absolutely loved it.  All she could say at first was "mmmmmmmmm" and she asked for another sample, ha ha.  She said it's flavourful and the perfect balance of sweet and BBQ-y.  My Mom's approval?  Priceless.  It must be good.

This was great!  I used the little bit of italian dressing left in the fridge, then added some red wine vinegar.  Served on a nice bun with some red slaw and some boiled BBQ style potatoes.  Great meal, and I enjoyed the leftovers just a much.

I followed Cooking_101's suggestion and put the chicken in the crock pot with some chicken broth, salt and pepper and let that cook on high for 4 hours.  We shredded it and put it back in the crockpot mixed with the rest of the ingredients.  I added much more BBQ sauce - it tends to soak up quickly.

This is amazing! Easy & delicious. I served with baked potato and corn. Would also make an excellent sandwich with the right kind of bread (we use Portuguese rolls "pops" around here).  Thanks.

I thought this was a boring dish and the chicken was dry like other reviewers had experienced.  It needs more ingredients.  I won't make this again.

I did something i never do I followed the recipe to a "T". The chicken cooking time definatly needs to be cut in half. My chicken was dry I left mine in the crock pot for 6 hours. Next time i will cook for only 3 and 1/2 hrs and use less brown sugar and like some reviewers use an onion in the sauce. The sauce it self was good, but the recipe itself needs some adjusting. I will try this recipe again, though.

Magnificent!  This was delicious and used ingredients I always have on hand.  I used bone-in chicken thighs (shredded them off the bone after cooking), KC Masterpiece honey BBQ sauce, & Bernsteins light cheese fantastico dressing.  I cut the brown sugar down to 1/8 cup, as the BBQ sauce was a sweet one.  Terrific served on the Honey Wheat Sandwich Rolls recipe on this site. Thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic!  It was just perfect.  I shredded it and we had it with a baked potato one night, and on a bun the next and both were fabulous.

Oh My This is wonderful. I did use the Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce. It can be found at COSTCO. I used 6 chicken breast halfs. (IE. 3 Whole Chicken breasts) I followed the recipe as stated and shredded the Chicken the before the last hour. The result was outstanding. I used a regular egg roll hamburger bun and OH MY, I did not have any left overs for the next day!!!!

Great, EASY recipe. I used Balsamic vinegrette because I didn't have any italian dressing -- it came out great! And I ommitted the sugar this time. I've made it both with and without the sugar and I honestly can't tell the difference.  It's really all about the BBQ sauce you use. Thanks.

This was delicious and so easy.  I omitted the Italian dressing (because I didn't have any) and some of the sauce stuck to the slower cooker crock.  Next time I'll definitely use the dressing.

I shredded a 3 pound rotisserie chicken and combined it with the sauce and cooked it on the stove on low for about 30 minutes.  It was so good!  My husband raved about it!

I actually left the chicken whole and served it up with some baked beans and some cornbread. I just drizzled a little of the sauce over the breast when serving and it was great! I did add some garlic and a little sea salt as well as some fresh cracked pepper. You can add just about any common ingredient and it will most likely turn out well. Enjoy!

The flavor is delicious. Although, I thought it was a bit too salty, so will cut back on the amount of Worcestershire sauce next time. Also, I cooked mine on low for 7.5 hours and the chicken was a bit dry.  In the past I have cooked chicken on low for 5-6 hours and it has been perfect.

This was very tasty and easy.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and followed the recipe exactly.  The only thing that I will change for next time is perhaps using less brown sugar.  I love all things sweet, but it was just a tad too sweet. It made for great leftovers the next day as well.

EDIT: i made this again and used 'Memphis Rub' (from this site) on the chicken and liquid smoke. in place of the other ingredients. cooked in a little chicken broth and bbq sauce. shreded and add more bbq sauce. this tasted even better then the first time i made it. Orignal review: i used 2 frozen chicken breast that i cut up in chunks. kept the other ingredients pretty much the same, with the addition of liqud smoke. cooked on high for 3 hours, shreded then cooked on high for another hour. very tasty  served with white bread and corn on the cob.

Great recipe!  I added a chopped onion, 1 tsp liquid smoke, some tony's seasoning and a few pinches of cayenne.  The BBQ sauce i used was by Jack Daniel's.  High cook until chicken is cooked then try to cook on low for as long as you can so the chicken takes all the flavor in!   YUMMY!!!!

This was a good alternative to slow cooker BBQ pork, which I make a lot. I would probably add a little more BBQ sauce next time, but no other changes. It was easy and my family liked it.

I have made this for years. I love how easy it is and that it is healthier than pork bbq sandwiches. Another thing I do, though, is add shredded carrots to it. This may sound strange, but you really don't taste them, and you are getting a little more veggies in your diet. When it is all cooked, you can't even see them, they look just like the chicken. Kids will never know.

Really good! I cooked the chicken on low in chicken broth for 3 hours, shredded and added to the sauce. Cooked on low for another three hours in the sauce. I reduced the brown sugar to 1 Tbsp.

Loved it.  I used a homemade bbq sauce that my husband and I use a lot.  It was so delicious on the chicken.  I will make this again and again.  I shredded the chicken after a couple hours and then put it back in for the remainder of the time.  Soaked up a lot of the excess juices.

My Husband LOVES this.  He even went so far as to say it's the best thing I've ever made for him and I've made him ALOT of meals! I also used fresh chicken, not frozen, and used the cooking time that other reviewers used. I used Jack Daniels for the bbq sauce.  I shredded the chicken then put it back in the slowcooker on low for about 45 mins so the flavors would soak in.  I served it in a sesame seed bun w/shredded cheddar cheese.  YUM!   Oh! and I also have a 2 yr old who is going thru the 'if I haven't eaten it before I'm not trying it' phase.  I got him to take a bite of this and he ended up gobbling up his whole serving!

This recipe is fantastic. Even when I scale it down for two people I still use 1/3 bottle BBQ and add about 1/4 cup chicken stock. It shreds perfectly and makes excellent sandwiches.

This was an all around great simple and tasty recipe. We loved it. We put it on kiaser rolls and was delicious.The left overs were just as good.I did not use the Worcestershire sauce because I did not have any but it still turned out. I did add one diced medium onion and 3 finly chopped cloves of garlic to add a bit more zing to it. I would not put it over a baked potato though. I think this is more of a bun meal like pulled pork but with chicken.Will make again and agian. Thanks!

I used leg quarters because breasts would be too dry after cooking that long in the slow cooker.  I liked the sauce.  It was easy, not spicy, and got through the chicken.  I made the mistake of cooking the chicken too long and it was slightly dried out.  However, the ease of the recipe and the tasty result will make me use this one again and again and again with a shorter cooking time.

These were really good, I did use Nana's Barbeque Sauce from AR instead of bottled bbq sauce. They were delicious. DH (who is having soem medical issues) loves pulled pork, now can't have it. He loved these and they are so much healthier for him. Thanks for the recipe.

My family and I thought this was really good. I went 4 stars instead of 5 b/c we weren't BOWLED OVER but it's definitely quite good. The first time I made it, we had it on buns. Second time, on Boboli with mozzarella as BBQ chicken pizza. We liked the pizza best. I made it according to the recipe (with Sweet Baby Rays Honey Sauce). I read reviews mentioning dry chicken and a sauce that was thin. I found that once you shred the chicken and return to the pot, the sauce is perfect. And the recipe calls for frozen chicken so if you opt to thaw yours first, take that into consideration on cook time to avoid drying out. Shredding into the sauce helps that as well.

AMAZING!  Followed as directed and it was fall apart delish!  I added minced garlic and onion, that's the only change I made, oh and I made the Italian dressing from a packet (which turned out oily and I had to spoon off oil when the dish was done cooking).

This recipe was great. I followed to a "T" except I cut in half. The cooking time was cut in half as well ( 4 hrs on low) for 3 chicken breasts. I used jack daniels original bbq sauce as another reviewer suggested, and added a little cayenne pepper for some spice.The chicken was tender and fell apart as I shredded it with 2 forks.The sauce was a little watery but as soon as the chicken was shredded it soaked it all up, perfect consistency. Husband loved it. It made 6 sandwiches using regular bread. I will definately be making this every week! THANK YOU

We did not care for this, sorry. I think I will stick to barbecue sauce without adding the italian dressing, from now on. This just was not the best.

Wow! This is great!  I halved the recipe, and defrosted the chicken first.  I used Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce, amd cooked the chicken on high for  1 1/2 hours, then shredded it, stirred it all up and let it cook for another hour.  It was great on a baked potato.  Will definitely make again!

This dish was delicious and so easy!!  I followed the original recipe directions exactly with one exception.  I used two fresh breasts of chicken that I cooked on high for 3 and ½ hours.  I then shredded the chicken and cooked it for another 30 minutes on low.  I put the chicken on top of a baked potato and with a little bit of sour cream on top I had a fantastic meal!  I will absolutely make this again!

Family loved this one. To save time in morning I put sauce & chicken in zip-lock bag then back in freezer overnight. I wanted to cook chicken from frozen state as I'd be gone longer the next day so extended cooking time. Chicken was very tender, steeped in flavor. Leftovers make great sandwiches or on rice.  Will use again.

I really wanted this to work! I am so disappointed. Mostly, in myself, because I think I did something wrong. I followed the recipe to a T and cooked on low for 5 hours. The flavor was great but my chicken was dry, dry, DRY. I don't know if it is my slow cooker? But I thought I would be honest with my review. My 5 yo loved it but the rest were not so impressed.

I don't know what it was because there were good reviews about this recipe but I just didn't care for it much. But I gave it 3 stars instead of 1 because some people told me they liked it. (Maybe they were lying!)

Yummy and delicious.  Made just like the recipe and it turned out great.  If used as a sandwich meat, it would need to be on a bun or hoagie as it would probably leak through regular bread.  Added a little Tiger Sauce for spice!

This was good but it didn't knock my socks off.  If you are using a bbq sauce that has a lot of sweetness to it you should reduce the brown sugar.  I'm not sure about the frozen chicken controversy but feel it's better to be safe than sorry so I used thawed breasts and just didn't cook them as long.  Good for sandwiches but the leftovers didn't get eaten so I'm rating 4 stars.

We loved this recipe! I used 4 breasts, thawed, with Sweet Baby Ray's hot BBQ sauce. We got 3 full meals for 2 and a lunch. The first meal I served on buns; second meal I put it on a Boboli pizza crust with mozzarella and bacon; finally I put it on baked potatoes as others had suggested. All were hits with my husband. I'll being making this one again and again.

Very good and easy recipe. The only changes I made were putting a sliced onion in the bottom of the crock pot and using about 10 oz Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce as that is all I had. I used frozen split chicken breasts (bone in) with the skin removed. About an hour before dinner I took the chicken off the bone (it just fell off) and shredded it then let it sit in the crock pot for the remaining hour - sauce really thickened up once chicken was shredded. Great on rolls. Nice flavor. Very versatile recipe - could be used with pork or beef. Will definately make again.

This was really tasty and easy! I only wanted to make two chicken breasts for dinner so I cut the recipe by half and only cooked it on low for 5 hours; it was really good. The chicken was so tender and the sauce had great flavor. I served it with roasted potatos and carrots and my hubby loved it! I will add this simple recipe to my regular rotation. :)

Yummy!  I did add a sliced onion to the sauce and let it simmer all day.  About an hour before I was ready to serve, I removed the chicken and shredded it.  I mixed it back into the sauce and let it simmer for the final hour.  Then served on rolls with potato salad.  Some of the leftovers will be frozen, and some will go on top of a BBQ chicken pizza.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this last night for my family and everyone loved it.  I did make some changes however.  I added some diced onion, and put half of BBQ sauce in the mix in the beginning and then added other half after shredding the chicken.  It was delicious.  The best BBQ chicken I have had...very tasty!!!

Love this recipe - it's sooooo easy!  I also added onion and fresh, minced garlic for some extra flavour.  Served it on a baked potato with a dollop of sour cream, green salad, and green beans on the side.  My husband raved about it.  Makes a great sandwich on a bun the next day as well.

I made this yesterday. The chicken turnd out very tender & had good flavor. Like others, the sauce was way to thin. After chicken was cooked, I took the chicken out & placed in a dish & then put the sauce in a pan & added corn starch to thicken. I did not like the way it tasted at all. What I did was mix up some more sauce like you make to pour over chicken in crock pot. I heated on the stove & poured over chicken breast. Shredded up the left over chicken for sandwiches. I think the frozen chicken waters down the sauce as it cooks, & it just doesn't taste near as good as it does when freshly made. After making the fresh sauce, it was yummy.

This was amazing! I added 3 garlic cloves and half an onion at the outset and just waited. It made the house smell so good it was killing me not to dig in! About an hour before it was finished, I shredded the chicken and the sauce thickened right up. We spooned it over baked potatos with a little sour cream. My boyfriend even yelled at me because I hadn't made this before. He said I was holding out on him! I would make this again in a heartbeat!

I made this for dinner tonight and served over mashed potatoes with baked beans and homemade biscuits on the side.  The whole family devoured it. 

I followed the recipe to a T except that I halved it because I only had 3 chicken breasts.  The chicken came out very moist and the BBQ sauce was really tasty, even though I hesitated for a moment on the italian dressing!

Fantastic recipe, very flavorful!  Thank you.

I will give this recipe 5 stars for easy to prepare and 5 stars for making my husband and my kids happy. 
I got the chicken and sauce all mixed up in the slow cooker this morning. It took me like 10 mins to put it together and I left to work. Since I had to stay late at work, I was not able to try this chicken. I called my husband on my way home from work and he said there was not chicken left for me. I am so surprise because my husband and kids are picky eater and my husband himself alone ate 7 pieces of chicken. I cannot believe that!
This must taste very good. I will definitely make it again so that I can eat some myself. Thanks for the great and easy recipe.

I had company over and made this recipe.  It was a hit everyone loved it including my 13 month old son.  Though I have to agree with other reviewers the sauce is watery.  However for me that wasn't a big deal, because the chicken is so flavorful you can strain the sauce.

Very delicious!Added 3 chopped garlic cloves and a small chopped onion. Used Sweet Baby Ray's original and Kraft Italian. Cooked 3 hrs on high,took out chicken and shredded it, added 2 tabs. flour to sauce,cooked for a few minutes, then returned chicken to pot, cooked an additional hour on low heat. Needed a bit of salt and pepper. Served on hard rolls with baked beans and green salad. Excellent on a cold and icy winter evening.

This was SOOO easy!
Usually, even though you are using a slow-cooker, it takes a considerable amount of time to "prep". With this recipe, it takes about 2 minutes! It is also delicious and different. Readers, don't be scared by the Italian dressing/bbq sauce combo. I was a little worried, but it's delish!

My family LOVES this chicken.  I made it in my pressure cooker and it was done in 40 minutes!  We ate it over mashed potatoes and some veggies on the side.  Excellent!

Easy, easy, easy.  Great dinner for after Sunday morning church service.  Used Famous Dave's sweet & zesty barbeque sauce & subbed Catalina for Italian dressing.  Served it over rice.  Thank you!

Wonderful !! I used 5 fresh chicken breasts in the slow cooker on high for two hours.. shredded the chicken and returned it to the cooker for an additional 30 min. on low so the chicken could absorb all the yummy juices. I did not change an ingredient and it was delicious.. It feed two of us for well over three meals (served over a pizza, drizzled with Ranch dressing and mozz cheese,  then with rolls and then again over baked potatoes) Also used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce, it's a staple in our house and so is this meal!

I've been wanting to cook this for so long so tonight I decided to make it and refrigerate it for dinner tomorrow.  It smelled and looked so good that I couldn't wait!  I used 2 frozen chicken breasts, half a bottle of BBQ sauce and then used a third of what was called for with the remaining ingredients.  I cooked the chicken with a can of chicken broth on high for 4 hours and then drained, added the remaining ingredients, and cooked for an hour on high to let the flavors blend.  YUM- thanks for a great recipe!

I made this to take to a Halloween party. I took another reviewers suggestions and slow cooked the chicken breast in chicken broth with seasonings for 4 hours (on high for 2 hours and low for 2 hours), drained, shredded the chicken and added the remaining ingredients and returned to slow cooker on low for another 2 hours. Everyone at the party really enjoyed this dish. I think next time I will try making with chicken thighs as I noticed the breast seemed a bit dry. Thank you for sharing your recipe!

There is no need to change this recipe at all, seriously.  I cooked my frozen chicken breasts on high for 3 1/2 hours, shredded them and then put them back in the slow cooker for 1 hour on low and it turned out perfect.  I did use good sauce though, Sweet Baby Ray's.  Yummy!

This is pretty good shredded for sandwiches but make sure you use a good bbq sauce. It will make a difference. Also, I just have to add that experts recommend you do not put frozen foods in the crockpot. All foods should be defrosted before cooking so the food temperature can reach 140 degrees as soon as possible otherwise it can sit too long at an unsafe temperature. I thawed the chicken before placing in my slow cooker. My kids loved this!

You def have to get your fav bbq sauce for this bec Its pretty much all the flavor. Unfortunaly I just dug out what I could find out of the fridge. So I had to add some steak sauce to not make it soo sweet. I also would not add sugar next time. I did add some hot sauce like I alway do to everything. I had this with mashed potatoes and corn but I think I would of liked it better on a bun with some horsratish. I cooked it for 3 hours on high, shredded it and 1 hour on low. I was so worried it would turn out dry but it wasnt at all. This would be a great for a outdoor bbq guess Ill have to wait till next summer:( Thanks for recipe.

This was very tasty....I am giving it a 4 star because the chicken was dry....You really needed the sauce on it, and some for dipping...otherwise it was very flavorful and easy. Will probably make again, a great week night meal. Thanks!

Wow this was great!!!  I scaled this down to serve two and it came out perfect.  The only change I made to the actual sauce was that I added some liquid smoke.  I also added some sliced red onion.  I cooked in my little crock pot, shred it, put it back in and let it cook a little longer so the chicken could absorb all the sauce, I ended up adding a little bit of Wondra to thicken it up just a tad.  Served this over baked potatoes with a little Ranch dressing on the side.  This would also make a great sandwich or bbq chicken pizza or even a bbq chicken salad.  Yum Yum Yum ~~  I will make this again and again.  Thanks for a great recipe :-)

This is a very good BBQ chicken recipe.  I was a little skeptical about adding Italian dressing but... it was delicious.  The first time I cooked it, the taste was great but the "juice" was really thin and watery.  After reading other reviews, I tried it again.  This time whebn it was done, I shredded the chicken and put it back in the crockpot with the juice.  Much better this time.  Thanks!!!

This is a staple at our house!  It is so easy and tasty-my husband and kids love it.   It freezes great.  I've served it as sanwiches, with rice, with potatoes, or just by it self.  Everyone I've made it for has LOVED it!  I almost always use frozen chicken breasts, too.

YUMMY! I followed the recipe...didn't change a thing...it was very good. My picky 18 year old liked it. I love how fast and easy it was! I ALWAYS forget to defrost chicken...so this recipe was great for me! I made it a completely easy dinner by making those new Ore Ida garlic mashed potatoes (they are peeled and cut you just pop the bag in the microwave for 10 min. then add milk and mash them!) I steamed a bag of frozen veggies too. Thanks for this quick and easy recipe! It's a keeper!

This is a very simple & tasty recipe! We had it on whole wheat buns the first night and I served it over baked potatoes the second night (leftovers) with some shredded cheddar cheese. We liked it better the second night over the baked potatoes. I'll be making this meal again!

This recipe turned out so good, and with very little effort!  I added some onion, salt and pepper. We liked the sauce, especially since we use regular BBQ sauce often, this gave the chicken a new kick!

Excellent! It rivals pulled pork for my favorite type of saucy hot sandwich. I used 3 thawed chicken breasts, 3/4 cup of BBQ sauce (I used Bullseye), 1/4 cup Italian dressing, around 2 TBS of brown sugar, and around 1 TBS Worcestershire sauce. Oh, and I added a can of mushrooms to the sauce. It was excellent. :) Maybe 20 minutes before serving, I added a couple more tablespoons of BBQ sauce to make it a little saucier. I followed Cooking 101's suggestion of seasoning, cooking, and draining the chicken (and 'shrooms!) before adding the sauce and it worked fabulously. Thanks for sharing, Zanne!

This is an excellent recipe. I was looking for a recipe that didn't use "cream of xxx soup". I made it last night and the only thing I did differently was I used fresh chicken breasts instead of frozen.I used a wonderful barbeque sauce- Saz's...then I cooked it on high for 3 hours and added some Wondra flour to thicken the sauce a bit directly to the slow cooker at the end. We didn't need to use knives. I served it with corn on the cob. It was delicious and very easy!

Yum, yum, yum! I used Sweet Baby Ray's brand BBQ sauce...also I only had 5 chicken breasts & it was fine (cooked on low for 6 hours). Also - 30 minutes before the 6 hours were up, I shredded the chicken and added some frozen chopped onion & some chopped purple onion. Since I added the onion towards the end, it softened up - but not too much, it still had a nice crunch.

Good recipe, but my boyfriend enjoyed it more than I did.  I followed several reviewers' advice and cooked the chicken (frozen) in a spice and chicken broth mixture on low for six hours.  I then removed and shred the chicken, drained the fat and liquid, and added my sauce mixture.  Because I used a honey barbecue sauce, I didn't add any brown sugar because I thought it would be too sweet.  The chicken cooked too long, however, and turned into mush after an additional hour with the sauce.  Next time I'll reduce the cooking time drastically.  Other than that, a very good recipe and one that I will try with modifications again.  Served on low fat, wheat buns with corn on the cob on the side.

SOOOO good! We absolutely loved this recipe.  I'm a sucker for spicy, so I added 1/2 tsp cayenne...just enough to give it some kick.  It will definitely be added to the "regulars". Thank you!

Really good!  The only thing I added was a teaspoon of liquid smoke.  The meat is so tender and the flavor is good.

Wow!  This recipe is awesome!  The chicken was so tender and delicous!  I so recommend this recipe to anyone who enjoys BBQ chicken without the hastle of standing over a grill.  Oh, I also cooked up some rice and roasted squash to go with it....Yummy!

Excellent!!  I have made this several times for big groups and have gotten rave reviews every time!  I add chopped onions and fresh minced garlic.  I also use half sweet/half spicy BBQ sauce.  Gives it just a little kick.  Turns out much better when use frozen breasts and cook on low all day.  This is a keeper!!

Yum! But what isn't good smothered in BBQ sauce? I followed the recipe exactly. The sauce looked to runny, but shredding the chicken took care of that. This was a great way to use up some frozen chicken breasts I had in the freezer. Will be making again, because everyone loved this. Thanks!

This was very easy and yummy. I took the advice of others and shredded the chicken and added it back to the sauce to thicken. Quick and easy meal for a busy weeknight/weekend.

Incredible!  We also stuck right to the recipe, while taking others' advice and adding a bit of onion and minced garlic. We used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce. We also topped it with Swiss right before eating.  Just great!  We'll definitely be enjoying this again and again!

I LOVED this chicken!!  It was so easy to make... I didn't have everything on hand to make it.  I had to substitute a raspberry vinagrette for the italian dressing and hot sauce for the worstershire sauce... but it turned out AWESOME!!!  Will definately make this again!

Very good...very easy!  I like many other reviewers added a little liquid smoke which gave the chicken a nice "outdoor BBQ" flavor.  Otherwise I kept the recipe the same.
Don't worry about it being too saucy.  My chicken breasts looked like they were swimming in the sauce until I shredded the chicken and added it back to the sauce. The chicken absorbed the sauce and it was perfect!

Yummy recipe!  Nice flavor to the meat even after it's become a "leftover."
I did have to drain a little of the sauce off midway through, but everything turned out great.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was really good.  I shredded it for sandwiches.  I'll definitely make again.  My only advice is to reserve some bbq/dressing sauce for after removing the chicken from the crock pot, because the sauce that it cooks in gets really watery (and trying to thicken with a spoonful of corn starch took away from the excellent sauce flavor).

This was just okay. Nothing extraordinary about it. I added a sliced Vidalia onion, garlic powder and a bit of
smoke flavoring. Cooked up well. I pieced the meat up and served it on a hamburger bun with homemade coleslaw.

Makes A LOT of chicken and sauce. Make this only if you like this sort of meal or you have a big family.

Absolutely delicious and SUPER easy!  The meat fell apart when I shredded it.  I didn't have Worcestershire sauce so I used A1 Steak sauce and it came out fine.  This will impress your guests as they will think dinner was catered from the location BBQ joint.  Can't wait to make it again!

I have made this twice.  The first time I shredded the chicken and served as sandwiches.  The next time I served whole with rice and vegetables.  My family liked it both ways.  I did not use frozen chicken -- I used defrosted, and cooked for 3 hours on high.  It was fall apart after just the three hours.
The recipe did not make enough sauce for us, so the second time I increased the sauce.  The taste and ease of this recipe are why I am giving it 5 stars.

This was a bit too sweet for my taste but my family loved it. It's a nice easy to prepare meal that I'll be making again. Instead of chicken breasts I used a whole chicken cut into sections, then pulled the skin off. I would have preferred it with boneless meat so next time I'll use a combo of boneless thighs and breasts.

My Husband and I LOVE this recipe.  I also suggest getting a good quality BBQ sauce for a dynamite meal.  We used a mixture of Stubbs Spicy BBQ and Stubbs Original BBQ.

I also recently used this same 'sauce base' for baked beans with bacon and onion.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe!!

WOW!  This got rave reviews from both the kids and my husband.  I agree with the other posters that the BBQ sauce you use will matter.
This recipe gets 5 stars not just for being delicious (which it is!) but for how easy it is to make.  A must keep and will make again!

This was just wonderful. I did add approx. 2 large cloves of garlic and seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper. The next time I will use splenda brown sugar just to cut down on the sugar amt. Also I did not want the chicken to pull apart or be to dry so I cooked it about an hour less.

This recipe is so good and so easy!  When I went to make it the first time, I didn't have any Italian dressing on hand, so used the Italian Dressing Mix from this site.  It turned out wonderful.

I made this over Memorial Day weekend.  I made sandwiches with the bbq chicken and served with potato salad and baked beans.  My family loved it!  It was so easy to cook in the slow cooker too...I just set it and forgot it.  The bbq sauce mix added a great flavor to the chicken with just enough balance of sweet and tangy.  This one is definitely a keeper!

Not bad.  The chicken could have a little more seasoning.  I will season the chicken next time before I add the sauce. My husband took this the next day to work and ate it cold in a wrap with cheese and loved it!

This was really good, and the chicken was tender. For some reason I felt the need to double the barbecue sauce, which meant that I had about 3 c. left over after chicken was done. This was so good, that I didn't want to throw it away, so I cut up kielbasa, fried it, and then cooked it in the sauce for an hour. Next time I make this, I will double the sauce, just so I can use it in this way! Thanks for the recipe!

We all loved this. After reading other reviews and considering our preferences, I made the following alterations - added one chopped onion, 3 cloves of garlic (minced) and 1/2 cup chicken broth. I put it in the crock pot before I left for work in the morning, came home and shredded the chicken, added about 1/4 cup flour mixed with a little water to prevent lumps, and cooked it for about 1/2 hour more. We ate it with baked potatoes and my husband took leftovers and made a sandwich out of it the next day. Quick, easy, tasty, enjoyed by even the picky "I don't like chicken" eater in the family. And the ingredients are all something I have on hand. Great recipe.

Very tasty.  Very easy.  Love the flavor.  I did put about a cup or so of chicken broth in the crock pot (thanks previous reviews)and the chicken was moist, tender and everyone loved it.

After making this recipe a few times I've tweeked it just a little bit. I make it with 6 oz of gourmet spicy Diana bbq sauce and then 6 oz of the regular so that its not too spicy. I add the other ingredients as listed and i also add a small diced onion and some liquid smoke (it really does make a difference). After about 4 hrs of cooking i shred the chicken and add about 1tbsp of cornstarch to thicken the sauce. I serve it over mashed potatoes (made with milk, butter, and diced onions) and chedder cheese on top. It tastes so yummy! Its my favourite recipe on this site. and if you put it all together in a container its tastes just as good the next day!

I followed the recipe exactly. The sauce was amazing! However the chicken came out too dry. Next time I will cook it for 6 hours instead of 8 on low.

THIS WAS REALLY GOOD. I'LL NEVER MAKE BBQ CHICKEN ON THE GRILL AGAIN. BEFORE I PUT THE CHICKEN IN THE SLOW COOKER, I APPLIED A BBQ RUB TO IT. THE FLAVOR WAS WONDERFUL AND THE MEAT FELL OF THE BONE.  NEXT TIME I'M GOING TO CUT BACK ON THE ITALIAN DRESSING. I THINK IT MADE IT A LITTLE WATERY. BUT BESIDES THAT IT WAS DELICIOUS AND I WILL DEFINITELY MAKE THIS AGAIN. THANKS.

Good, but a tiny bit dry. Like other reviewers, I cooked my chicken in broth and shredded it before adding the bbq sauce. I wish I had saved a little of the broth and added it back after I put the barbecue ingredients in.

I tried this recipe tonight and it was an instant success with my family.  I only used 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, but followed the remainder of the recipe exactly.  We love it, and will definitely be having it again and again!

It was good just a little dry. I think I will add chicken broth next time.  I've made my own variations of this over the years.  The taste of the sauce was good, but we just ended up putting our favorite spicy bbq sauce on it.  I think I will save this as a winter stand by and stick with marinated chicken on the grill for the summer.

So easy, and delicious.  It was great even using a cheap barbeque sauce I had on hand and low-fat Italian dressing.  My son loved the sauce over a baked potato, too.  Thanks, Zanne!

I thought this recipe was pretty good, especially when you consider how quickly and easy you can make it.  I started this recipe at 2:00 pm and when cooked on high it was ready to serve at the 6:00 meal.  I made the recipe as is and my husband and two young kids liked it.  The first day I served it on rolls, and the 2nd day I used the leftovers to make my own version of California Pizza Kitchen's barbecue chicken salad.  Wonderful!  Thanks for the good easy recipe that I will definitely be making time and again.

Wow! This was SO easy and SO delicious. Truly a fix it and forget it recipe! I added a couple of shakes of garlic and onion powder along with a couple of drops of liquid smoke. Then just before serving I added 2 TB flour for thickening. I served them on "Burger or Hot Dog Buns" recipe from this site. Fabulous meal!

We liked this recipe.  I actually used split checken breasts instead of the boneless chicken.  I also put cayenne pepper on the chicken and added  liquid smoke to the marinade.

WOW!!! I used a honey BBQ sauce and I too like a heartier sauce so I added more dressing and Worcestershire sauce. I shredded it and let it soak up the BBQ sauce. Then I put it a large whole wheat dinner rolls! SO GOOD!! And it's even better as left overs!

I love this recipe! I've made it both ways. First way: frozen chicken cooked in bbq sauce mixture. Second way: chicken cooked in broth, then liquid drained, meat shredded, and bbq sauce added to cooked meat. 

While it takes a little extra time, it's definitely worth it to cook the chicken first, before adding the bbq sauce mixture, for several reasons: 1) The chicken tastes better. 2) The sauce is less runny (this is especially important if you're making sandwiches) 3) It's easier to see extra "stuff" that needs to be thrown out when you're shredding the chicken, 4) you get rid of extra fat, since that gets drained off rather than mixed in with the bbq sauce.

Either way, this recipe is a winner. I made it as directed 4-5 times before following the reviewers' advice and cooking the chicken separately. When I tested the finished product (cooked the new way), I was so excited that I started dancing around the kitchen. Literally.

btw - the dressing/bbq sauce really do matter. I use Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce and Ken's Steak House Zesty Italian dressing.

I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe.  Very good taste and couldn't be much easier.  It made lots of sauce so I will cut back on that the next time I make this. Used thawed chicken drumsticks and they were done easily in 4 hours on high.

I have made this recipe often, and it's always so good and so easy.  The best part is that you can use frozen chicken breasts (i.e., no prepping before the slow-cooker).  I like to make this with spicy sweet potato fries from this site.

I used chicken legs and thighs. It came out with a layer of grease on top because I didn't remove the skin, so next time I will make sure I do that. I don't like white meat in the slower cooker because it tends to dry out fast. Overall the recipe was quite tasty.

I used Cattleman's sauce, and added some onion flakes. Cut/pull apart the chicken after a few hours and each piece with be perfectly moist and saturated with flavor!

My husband didn't like this very much, which means that I got to eat the whole pot by myself! A little salty; next time I'll adjust.

I made this recipe pretty much by the book, and only added slight modifications. I used 4 chicken breasts and used Tony Roma original BBQ sauce. I left my crockpot on low while at work and unfortunately that was still too hot bc when I got home, it had started to burn the sauce. To help fix, I added additional brown sugar, a little garlic and about 3/4 cup of a Smoked BBQ sauce to help get rid of the burned flavor.  Ishredded the chicken, mixed it all together and served on rolls topped with some good hotsauce and it was absolutely wonderful. I will make again but will keep the crockpot on warm instead of low!

I prepared this recipe as written today in crockpot with boneless, skinless, chicken breasts. Sauce is good but of course watered down a bit from chicken. Chicken was rather dry. If I try again I will used cut up fryer chicken or bone in chix breasts.

This was not too good!  Too sweet!  I prefer a more savory sauce.  I halved the brown sugar too.  Will not make again!  On an up note - the chicken did come out moist and pretty much fell apart when cutting.

I made this for the first time tonight for dinner. It turned out fantastic. I made the recipe exactly as posted. My husband and son thought it was very good too? I am planning on doubling the recipe to make for the super bowl game.

Good flavor!  I loved making these in the slow cooker.  The chicken fell apart when I took it out, and easily pulled apart for bbq chicken sandwiches.  Will definitely make these again.

Like other reviewers said, tasted much better after it's shredded.  I thought it's okay but hubby loved it, serve with bread to make it a chicken bbq sandwich, good for people like us who don't eat red meat.

The easiest recipe ever and I have never received less than a rave review, even by my healthnut roommate. I like to serve with baked potatoes and scoop extra sauce right on to the potato.

Everyone in my family enjoyed this very easy recipe. I used KC Masterpiece bbq. sauce hot & spicy, only a 1/4 cup of Italian dressing. I put it in for 8hr frozen, pulled it apart at 6 1/2 hrs then turned it off. It would have been ruined otherwise instead it made a perfect pulled chicken sandwich.

5 stars for being so easy! I didn't have boneless, skinless breasts so I used bone-in chicken breasts instead. The chicken tasted great for such a simple recipe. I will make again as an easy week-night dinner.

I made this recipe as is, and my husband LOVED it.  I think  it is important to use a good BBQ sauce, though.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's mixed with a little KC Masterpiece Hickory Smoke.  I shredded the leftover chicken for BBQ Chicken sandwiches, and it was so delicious.

I love the basic recipe. But a good twist is to cook it a little longer add onion and green peppers and make it into sandwiches. At about 8 hours I broke up the chicken and let it cook a few hours longer. It was moist and wonderful. Thanks so much for a great recipe.

Really tasty. Next time I think I'll dump some vegetables in during the last bit of cooking time as there was a lot of sauce that would have been really good with some veggies.

Quick and easy way to fix bbq chicken.  I would highly recommend using a very high quality bbq sauce or make your own.  I used some hunts that i had on hand and although the kids devoured this, the adults thought it could be much better.  I will be making this again but use my own sauce recipe.  Thanks!

This recipe is easy and delicious! I threw five boneless chicken breasts in the crockpot in the morning, along with the other ingredients, turned it on low, and when we got home from work, dinner was waiting for us. The meat was incredibly tender and the flavor was fabulous. My only change was that I used 1/4 cup of Good Seasons zesty Italian dressing because it's all I had.

This recipe was excellent. I read a number of reviews that talked about adding chicken stock so I did, but it was unnecessary and resulted in the chicken being a little too wet. Still the sauce was great and we like things extra saucy so it wasn't a problem.  Cooked it on low for about 7 hours and the chicken was perfectly moist and falling apart.  I shredded the chicken, put it back into the sauce, and served it over rice. Will make it again and again. (I used Bull's Eye original bbq sauce and Bernstein's Light Balsamic vinegrette dressing).  I have a lot of leftovers, so I am making BBQ chicken pizza tonight.

This was excellent.  After cooking for 7 hours on low I  shredded thie chicken and put back in the pot with some more bbq sauce.  Made sandwiches with buttered toasted kaiser rolls and some nice tart cole slaw.  This was a hit. Thanks Zanne!

We thought this was wonderful!!! Used Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and fat free italian, ate chicken and extra sauce over brown rice. I don't understand how anyone could have gotten dry chicken or how it could have burned unless you used way too little sauce. It's YUMMY!

EXCELLENT! Took other reviewers' suggestions...cooked the chicken for 4 hours in chicken broth...fell apart when i went to shred it...threw it back in the crock pot with the bbq (I used Bulls Eye) mixture just as in the recipe minus the worcestershire sauce. Served it with a salad and crinkle fries. Boyfriend loved it. Can't wait for leftovers for lunch as I always double my recipes :-)

This was a hit with the family. I used fresh chicken, great value bbq sauce. The sauce was thin so I used a very small amount of thickening. It made it thicker and a bit smoother. Great dish.

I've made this recipe countless times in the last few years and it's always delicious. Couldn't be easier to throw together in the morning and then shred and throw on some toasted buns for dinner. We love it with coleslaw, corn on the cob, and potato wedges. Yum. :)

Tasty but chicken breasts were a little dry.  It would probably taste really good with some type of bone-in chicken.

This recipe was very good and tasty. My sauce was too thick for my roll, so I put my meat on a baked potatoe. I also cooked some baked beans with ground beef in it. I used KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce, but next time I will use a thinner sauce in order to eat it on a bun, but the thickness was good for a topping on a baked potatoe. Very Good, Will cook again.

This turned out really well!  I put the chicken in frozen, salt/peppered the breasts, covered them completely with chicken broth, cooked on high for about 2 1/2 hours.  Took out the chicken and pulled it apart, mixed all the ingredients, and added a little bit of liquid smoke.  It was awesome!  Served it on toasted onion rolls with baked beans and cole slaw as appetizers.  Beer is a must with this dinner!

This was fabulous! I cooked twice the amount of meat used in the recipe (big crowd) so I needed twice as much sauce. I used two different BBQ sauces, both really good quality. I didn't have quite enough ranch dressing, so I substituted some parmesan peppercorn. I cooked it on high just until it was good and hot, then pushed it back to low for several hours. At the end of cooking I pulled the chicken out and shredded it, putting it back into the sauce to moisten and absorb more tangy goodness for about 30 minutes. We had it with slow cooker mac & cheese. Deeeelish! We had it another night with garlic mashed potatoes- ooooohhhhh so gooood! The left overs that I froze will be enjoyed with corn bread and green beans- which I'm sure will be to die for. This is something that will be gracing our table several times this winter, as well as next summer when I'm craving moist, tangy BBQ without all the work! A winner that should be in everyone's recipe box!

My family LOVED this recipe!  The first night we ate on toasted buns.  The kids kept saying that this was the "best ever!"  The leftovers, we baked potatoes and then cut them open, stuffed them with this chicken, covered with cheese and put under the broiler for a couple minutes.  YUM!  I have already shared them with several friends and we will make this again and again!  THANK YOU! (OH, I did add one cup of chicken broth to help keep moist while they cooked all day.  We used Sweet Baby Rays original BBQ sauce too...TERRIFIC!)

This was pretty good.  I used boneless skinless chicken breasts (frozen) and added potatos and carrots.  I only cooked it for 3 hours or so on high.  The chicken would have been done in 2 hours, I had to wait on the carrots.  I also flipped the chicken once to keep it in the liquid so it didn't dry out.

I made this for my brothers High School Graduation party and it was a hit!!  Put it in before the ceremony and later in the day it was so tender and flavorful.  My dad and I were in the fridge the next few days eating leftovers.  My brother finally told us to "quit jockin the chicken"

Delicious!  Followed suggestion to use just half the bottle of bbq sauce (Jack Daniels #7) initially, then with an hour to go shredded the chicken, drained the crockpot and put it back in with the remaining bbq sauce.

I cooked this for 4 hours on high because I was gone during the afternoon. The chicken was dry and not very flavorful. We served it on buttered and fried hamburger buns with pickles and more bbq sauce, but it was still dry.

I made this for a weekend gathering and it was wonderful. I did make a few small changes. I doubled the sauce. I added minced garlic, green onion, and a little bit of diced yellow onion. I cooked on low for about 5 hours and then on high for one hour. I shredded it and cooked it on low for another hour. It was so full of flavor and moist! I served it on rolls with baked potatos, baked beans, and fried okra. I have to agree with everyone else...as wonderful as this is the first day...it is even better the second day! Thanks for a super easy family pleasing recipe!!!

This was very good and I wouldn't have changed anything about it.  It was nice to be able to just put the chicken breasts in frozen.  And it would be good shredded up on toasted buns.

Made fantastic shredded "pulled" chicken sandwiches!  I used 6 frozen skinless breasts and checked after 4 hours on low.  The chicken was cooked and already a tad dry so I decided to shred it.  I left the shredded chicken on warm for another hour and it was excellent.  I used Buster's bbq sauce (a local BBQ joint), served on pub buns with coleslaw.  There are probably better pulled chicken recipes, but the ease of this one make it a definite 5 star!

My family LOVES this recipe...Even my picky eaters in the house will eat it. ( I have 4 little kids ages 10,8,6 and almost 3)
The italian dressing tenderizes it as it cooks!
My husband like DRY BBQ loved this and requests it ALL the time.
Great for church functions, get togethers or pot lucks!

This recipe was ok, but it did not turn out the way I thought it would. Instead of using chicken breast, I used chicken legs. Using Jack Daniels barbecue sauce really did not make a difference. Using .77 cent sauce is just as good as any other brand. The Italian dressing wasn't really needed in the recipe. You really couldn't taste it. I would probably not make this recipe again, but thanks for the recipe

This chicken turns out fabulously when done in the slow cooker and shredded, and also when baked in the oven and then broiled for the last few minutes. I've made this with a whole chicken in a slow cooker, cserved the slices of chicken for dinner that night, adn then shredded the rest of the meat for sandwiches later on. Cooking this chicken in the oven and then broiling for the last few minutes is a great substitute for those who cannot grill!

It was very good over rice.  I used frozen tenderloins instead of breast.  Next time I will thaw the chicken though.  I think it made the sauce to watery with it being frozen first.

This was okay, but not great.  In fact, before making this recipe, I usually just cook chkn in the crock pot with some water, drain it, shred it, and mix it with some bottled BBQ sauce.  It tastes better than this recipe and is MUCH easier.  I think I'll just go back to doing that.

I followed the recipe exactly and my chicken was super dry and almost burned.  We ended up eating out that night.  I will not be making this again.

Didn’t have Italian salad dressing so used 2 Tbsp & 2 tsp. olive oil along with 1 tbsp. cider vinegar & 1 tsp of Italian seasoning spices (scaled to 2 servings). Served with corn on the cob & mashed potatoes as another suggested. Was quite tender & very easy to make!

Easy 2 (or 3) ingredient recipe that was delicious!  The taste was not too overpowering either.  I used chicken breasts which just fell apart into pulled chicken by the 8th hour in the cooker.  I, too, added garlic the second time I tried it, and it was nice addition.

This is sooooooooo yummy! I have made it twice now, in like 2 weeks...BUT i have to say, The first time was a little better. I used the bulls eye brown sugar smoke bbq sauce, that was so yummy! The second time i used Sweet Baby Rays, and it was tooooo sweet, but the first time it was so perfect, so i give it 5 stars. I also shredded it and ate it on buns with mayo....mmmmmmmm....... thanks!!

This recipe was incredibly easy to make and oh-so yummy!  My kids and my husband loved it!  I suggest shredding it and putting it on some good bread for out of this world bar-be-que chicken sandwiches.

This was pretty tasty and definitely easy. I started with frozen breasts and cooked them on low for 6 hours. Then I pulled them out, shredded them and put them back in for an hour to soak up some sauce. I served these on rolls which I liked, and I think next time I may serve them on a roll with coleslaw on top because this seems like it would make a good match.

A winner!!!  The barbeque sauce was so good!!!  I put the slow cooker on in the morning and came home to a wonderful aroma!  I shredded the chicken..... put it on a fresh kaiser roll with a slice of swiss cheese and popped some sandwiches into the toaster oven.  Oh man!  That was heaven!!!!!  Thank you for an easy and awesome recipe!

We loved this recipe.  We cut the chicken up afterwards and ate it on rolls.  We did listen to others advise and didn't cook it for the length of time recommended.  It is really easy to overcook.

Delicious! I served this when we had friends coming over but I was going to be gone all day. Might have cooked a little long as it was dry but otherwise everyone had rave reviews... even passed the recipe on to my mother!

Delicious and incredibly easy to make.  I added hot sauce, red pepper flakes, and garlic, and used chicken drumsticks (as it was what I had on hand).  Will definitely make it again.

Very happy with this recipe! Fast-easy-tasty-what could be better? I altered it a bit by using about 3 lbs of boneless, skinless thighs. I seared them quickly on high heat with a bit of olive oil before going into the crock pot. I used fat free Italian dressing (which I never use but thought for a sauce it would be fine...and it was!) Put seared chicken thighs in pot, top with sauce. I had it on high for about 3-3.5 hours and it was perfect. Removed chicken pulled it apart with 2 forks, placed on grilled hoagie rolls & topped with the sauce. Everyone loved it...a keeper!

Everybody is right-you have to use your favorite bbq sauce, and if you do, this recipe is the best. It's fast, easy, delicious and uses ingredients you probably already have. Great the next day for bbq chicken sandwiches, too.

This was very easy and tasty. I used thawed chicken breast and it took 3.5 hours on high and it was falling apart tender. I wish I would have saved some bbq sauce to have on the side - my sauce was very thin.

This is a great, easy recipe.  My only advice would be, make sure you LOVE the flavor of your BBQ sauce.  I did use a Jack Daniels sauce, but it was a little too smoky for my taste.  I loved being able to throw frozen chicken in the crock pot and have dinner be ready after work. It doesn't get any easier!

I made this with a cooking group awhile back. This was 'ok'. A quick fix for dinner. We ate it in tortillas as soft tacos. Not sure if I would make again, my family wasn't all that impressed.

This wasn't too bad.  My husband didn't like it as much as me so that it why I only gave it 3 stars.  He isn't too fond of cooking chicken in the crockpot because he says it always tastes like "crockpot".  I shredded the chicken when it was done cooking and probably won't cook it as long next time but I will be making this again since I like to do as much crockpot cooking as I can.  Thanks for the recipe.

What a great meal when you are in a pinch.  I frequently forget to take something out of the freezer for dinner and we end up going out to dinner so this was a great save.  My husband and I both really enjoyed this meal (he LOVES BBQ), I think the key is to use a BBQ sauce you really love.  It makes a great pulled chicken sandwich or serve with a slaw and some corn bread.  YUMMY!

This recipe is so easy and convenient for us 'busy folk'. The chicken is tender and finger lickin' good! It made a good impression with all. The juice made a good topping with the baked potatoes. A must try!

This recipe was good.  The sauce was a little watery but after I shredded the chicken it made up for that a little.  We ate it on buns and my hubby really enjoyed it.  We had leftovers so I sauteed some onions combined it and we ate it over rice the next day, delicious!  Thanks!

Prepared this ahead of time for a freezer co-op swap.  Chicken frozen in one seal-o-meal bag and other ingredients mixed and sealed in a separate bag for the freezer.  It was very delicious, and I received a call from the home of a swapper, where "if 3 out of 5 eat any meal...it is a good night"--for this meal, 5 out of 5 enjoyed not only firsts, but seconds.  I was asked to put this on the repeat list!

This recipe is a good starting point for what you want it to be but I feel that the cook has to help it become something. We shredded it and some added barbecue sauce because the liquid in the slow cooker was too runny to do much with. Others of us just ate the meat shredded as is and added sliced onions and pickles. Served this up on buns. Also, this almost was too done with the prescribed cooking times but it did ok. I will tinker with this one. Thanks.

I STRONGLY suggest ensuring that you like the bbq sauce and dressing before you try this. I made a mistake and tried a new sauce that none of us liked, so it ruined the dish. It would have been wonderful, though so I will try again! I shredded the chicken, also and put it on buns. So easy and could have been so good. It cooks quicker than you think, so make sure you don't dry it out!

This recipe is AWESOME and extremely easy.  I was weary of the ingredient combo, but it turned out really good.  I do agree that shredding the chicken is a must, as I cannot imagine eating this without a bun!

Yum, yum, yum!  This was sooooooo good.  I used boneless skinless thighs.  We were going to have this for dinner last night but we didn't.  So it cooked ALL day.  I shredded it last night and It was awesome.  I can't wait for dinner tonight!

Family enjoyed, house smelled great while it was cooking. You can be different every time by playing with different barb. sauce and drsg. Chicken was really tender-served over white rice.

I have a home daycare and all the children loved the zesty chicken barbecue.  Since I doubled the recipe I shreeded the leftovers and made sandwiches out of them for the next day.

WOW!  Very, very tasty and couldn't be any easier.  I just love being able to take chicken breasts from the freezer and throw them in the crockpot.  I need more recipes like this!  My kids ate this and declared it "super-duper good!"

This was a great, easy dish!  My chicken was tender (shredded itself) and tangy tasty!  I don't normally enjoy barbecue sauce because its too sweet for my taste but when I added some to a roll I enjoyed it.  Keeping for busy days!

My husband said, "This is probably the first thing you've made in the crock pot that wasn't dried out." And he's right. It was delicious served shredded, on hamburger buns, with cheese-corn as a side dish. Even my 21-mth-old ate it, with gusto! Thanks for the recipe.

I made this yesterday and it turned out great. I used Sweet Baby Ray's Original Barbecue sauce and cooked in the crockpot for about 7 hours, then took it out to shred it. I put the shredded beef into a piece of stoneware and stirred in all the sauce w/ it and put it in the oven for about 30 minutes at 350 to finish it up and rewarm. Served on Kaiser Rolls - wonderful!

It was alright.  Very good if you used BBQ sauce to cover it after the fact, but to dry without it.

This recipe was ok for me.  It did have a good flavor, but was just missing some "zing" to give it 5 stars!  I think if you shredded the chicken in the sauce, it would make excellent sandwiches.

Amazingly good although its not fancy. But its so quick, easy, and relatively healthy it should be in every working mother's recipe box.  It didnt look like there was enough fluid to keep the chicken moist to start with, but it worked out perfectly even so.

I followed the directions as is, but next time will maybe add the cornstarch and water somebody said to thicken the sauce.  The chicken was awesome and there was none left over!  It's so easy; you don't even have to thaw out the chicken.  We will have it again!

I added onions and green peppers about half-way through the cooking process. The aroma was 'scent'sational. When my daughter got home from school she couldn't wait for dinner. There were no left-overs so this is a definite keeper.

These is pretty good and very easy to make.  I cooked mine on low for six hours and it was a little over done.  I will make this again and shorten the time to see if there will be any changes.

Great recipe. I shredded the chicken during the last hour of cooking. The sauce was very thin. We ate the chicken on sandwich buns and added more BBQ sauce from the bottle.

This recipe was excellent.  Quick and easy to make!  I cooked it on low in the slow cooker for about 7 hours and the chicken was very tender and delicious!  I didn't have any Worcestershire sauce but it was still very good without it!

This recipe was really great...super easy to make too.  My family loved it.  It will be fun to try different BBQ sauces to change the flavor each and every time.

Wow... this was excellent. I'm not crazy about bbq chicken but this was really good. I took the idea of shredding the kitchen and man I think it was the best idea of all. After I mixed up the bbq I called my mom and told her how good I thought it was going to be, so she made it too! She used whole breasts with bone and skin... hers wasn't NEAR as good. 

Seriously consider shredding if you really want to enjoy this delicious recipe!

I made it for dinner and it was ok.  It is a simple way to make barbecue chicken but I think it was an awful lot of sauce to make it.  Was not good the next day.

I was disappointed in this one-- it was OK, but I really was expecting something spectacular because of the reviews I read.  The flavor turned out alright and the dish was super easy to make, but BBQ chicken is easy to do anyway either on the grill or in the oven.  I probably will not make this one again.

Made this last night and had really high hopes for it. It's not bad, just tastes like regular old barbecued chicken. I think I'm going to shred it and make BBQ chicken sandwiches with it. Don't know if I will make again.

I followed the directions and added 1 tsp. liquid smoke as recommended by another reviewer.  I also used Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ Sauce.  I thought the sauce was too sweet.  Next time I will skip the brown sugar or use a BBQ sauce that's not as sweet.The consistency came out great.  I put the chicken on French rolls and made sandwiches with the meat. Great recipe to have for BBQ's for those who don't eat pork or beef.

Followed directions aside from non-frozen chicken.
Cooked on low for 6 hours, then shredded chicken, then left on warm for another hour before serving.

Simple and everyone loved it.

By far one of my favorite recipes! It is a bit sweet so I have started adding a tad less brown sugar. I do thaw my chicken before adding it to the crock pot and Sauce is quite thin but leaving the crock pot lid off for the last hour or so once re adding the shredded chicken helps it thicken perfectly. Will be making very regularly, very easy and normally have all the ingredients on hand.

After I shredded the chicken (in a separate bowl) I scooped out most of the juice from the crock pot and then put the chicken back in. Squirted more barbecue sauce from the bottle on top, stirred. Then added the sauce back, over the duration of the cooking time. Turned out great!

Made this for a  get together with another couple to watch hockey, and it was a hit!  I used fresh, not frozen, chicken breasts with the ingredients exactly as listed, cooked it on high for 3 hours, then shredded the chicken, stirred it back in and cooked another hour on low, as was suggested by another reviewer.  It sat a bit longer as I made a salad and cooked some potatoes in the microwave.  It was not too "liquid-y" as other reviewers mentioned.   My husband had his on a bun, and the rest of us put some on top of a half of a baked potato with some shredded cheese.  I will definitely make it again.

I make this often, it’s so good and so easy! I don’t use frozen chicken breasts, I use a package of “fresh” ones from the meat department. And we always use Stubb’s BBQ sauce. Can’t be beat!! Goes great on sandwiches or potatoes.

I was very pleased how this recipe turned out.  I used all the ingredients  as the directions said and loved the taste.   Sauce is thin till you shred the chicken up. The meat tasted even better the next day.   This is my go to BBQ chicken sandwiches now.

Made it with frozen boneless chicken breasts u get in a bag at Walmart. (Cheap stuff) used good ingredients but had to add more brown sugar to tone down the acidic italian dressing that my stomach personally has a hard time with. Tastes much better. Did not have any of the problems other people had. In fact mine took longer on high than expected. 5 hours with 6 chicken breasts. Very yummy! Will definitely make again.

I followed the directions as described, and this turned out better than advertised.  I am cooking for one person, but I did four breasts.  It made enough for three lunches and then I froze the rest so I could have another lunch or two down the trail!  Thanks for sharing this timeless southern great!

I used Sweet Baby Ray's Bbq and didnt make any changes to the recipe except using less chicken since it's just for me and my boyfriend.  Both of us love it and it's so simple to make.

My husband said it was the best barbecue chicken he's ever had!

However, I left out the Italian dressing. Just barbecue sauce, brown sugar, and Worcestershire sauce. The chicken was frozen so, once it thawed out, there was plenty of moisture in there to keep it juicy.

I followed Cooking 101's directions (seasoned breasts with garlic powder, salt & pepper and cooked with a can of chicken broth on low all day), drained juice after cooking for 8 hours on low in crock pot and shredded chicken, then added italian dressing, Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce and worcestershire sauce.  Served on slider buns.  YUMMO!  Already had one person ask me for my recipe.

The chicken was extremely tender however the sauce was very watery and seemed oily.  It did not look like BBQ chicken.  I would not make this again.  (I did use the frozen breasts and maybe that was the problem.)

This recipe is a great starting point for perfect pulled bbq chicken.  I made a few changes:  1) used a tried and true sauce (Jones Sisters), though I think it would be worth the effort to make my own going forward, 2) added 3 cloves of minced garlic and a thinly sliced Vidalia to the sauce, 3) skipped the Italian dressing and added 1/2 bottle of dark beer instead, 4) cooked 5 chicken breasts on high for 3 hours, shredded the meat and returned to the crock pot on low for an hour, 5) served on brioche buns with cheddar and dill pickle slices.  Enjoy!

I had 8 skinless boneless chicken breasts and thawed them first.  The ingredients were enough for all 8 breasts and shredding them at the 3 hour mark of the 6 hours through cooking was an excellent suggestion in the video.  It kept the breast coated through all the chicken.

I had a cooked chicken leftover that I needed to to get rid of.  So I shredded the chicken added chicken stock and BBQ sauce.  I added beer and didn't use the salad dressing.  it was tasty.  The next day; I made pulled chicken pizza on naan with green onions and bacon with the leftovers. YUM

Love this! I make this often - I do add 2 tablespoons of butter to keep the chicken from being dry.  I always butter & toast the rolls for the sandwiches prior to serving.  Warms up well too.

Yummy & Easy!!! I used a frozen package of chicken breast cutlets... thawed and cleaned. Billy Rays Honey BBQ (left out the brown sugar.) Used Lea & Perrins, Zesty Italian dressing, added chopped onion, garlic powder and salt & pepper. Cooked in crock pot for two hours. Then shredded chicken. Cooked another hour before removing cover to cook down the liquid for the last 45 mins to an hour... (stirring occasionally.) SO GOOD! Even my picky housemate keeps raving about it. Left-overs are great, so make the whole batch up!

Big hit with the whole family!! I used 8 boneless skinless thighs because we prefer dark meat. Was not dry at all. Left the lid off the crockpot for about  30 min after shredding chicken to let the sauce reduce a bit. Will definitely make again. Highly recommend.

I made this but had to use different ingredients as I didn’t have brown sugar nor Italian dressing so I made it with garlic Parmesan sauce, and a brownsugar spruce that I had it came out perfect, then added zucchini to it and made a meal!

This recipe turned out excellent.  I did follow the first review I read about first cooking the chicken in chicken broth with onion and green pepper and draining the fluid and shredding the chicken.   Also added the sauce to the chicken and cooked for an hour or so to marry the flavors.  I do agree to use a good BBQ sauce to mix with the sauce recipe as written.  I did make extra sauce because that’s what’s gives this dish all the flavor.

I would add another chicken breast, as it was very saucy. My family loved it though.

Very easy recipe that turns out great.  I added small diced onion and minced garlic.  I shredded chicken toward the end of cooking and let shredded  chicken simmer or cook longer in crock pot.

I made this for Memorial Day picnic and family loved it.  Next time I will cook the chicken breasts thawed as I usually do in the crockpot before adding the remaining ingredients.   That way I can easily tell when they are done, and the chicken will be a little more moist especially around the edges.

This turned out really delicious!  I took the advice of some other readers & first defrosted the chicken.  Added a chopped onion to the crockpot and 2 heaping TBS. pureed chipotle in adobo sauce.  We like things hot.  Also, shredded the chicken after 2.5 hours on high.  Put chicken back in the sauce & cooked an additional 45 minutes.  Yummy

Was very good! The addition of salad dressing was so useful. Adding just enough extra flavor. Just an FYI on bottled bbq sauce package may say 20 ounces net weight but not all are true. When I measured the sauce for the 12 oz on the ingredients that 20 oz bottle was really 12 ounces of product. I did call the company and they confirmed the info on the bottle included packaging weight also. I was very disappointed with that fact. Had absolutely no negative effect on flavour. I am keeping this for future meals. Thank you for the great recipe.

I used a pork tenderloin cooked first in root beer, then shredded and then used this recipe. It made the BBQ sauce not so strong and even the kids ate it. I will try chicken  next time. It is a keeper! I did over cook my pork, but was away and couldn't turn the crock pot off. Think I will invest in a timer!

The four stars are my fault. I didn't want to wait for fresh breast halves to freeze so I bought a bag of Tyson frozen. The sauce itself was delicious! Next time I'll go to Whole Foods to by range free breast halves. Then it will get five stars.

I followed the directions as written. There was so much liquid and chicken didn’t have much flavor. After shredding, it was put back in empty crockpot on low, and cooking liquid was placed in saucepan and simmered until reduced by half. 
When poured onto chicken it was just right. 
Served with hamburger buns, sliced red onion, coleslaw, dill pickles and kettle chips. 
I will make it again, but will cook chicken with some seasoning. Then I will pour the sauce over skipping the reduction step. 
Overall, we were very pleased with the recipe.

I will definitely make this easy pulled bbq chicken again and again.  I made a couple of adjustments due to taste preference.  I used a Mediterranean style dressing to reduce the vinegar taste.  I used half the brown sugar and for my family this was still sweet enough.  I also make my own bbq sauce.  It was very tender and juicy!  We loved it!  I’m going to make another batch to freeze for a busy day.

I made this last night, and my family loved it! I used 3 huge frozen breasts that I halved to get the 6 breasts, so it only took about 5 hours on low to cook thoroughly. However,  I left it in for 6 hours and just spooned the sauce over all of the pieces every so often to keep it moist until my family arrived home for dinner (*and for the last hour, I turned the setting down to the “Serve” setting  to keep it from over-cooking in order to get to the 6 hour mark). I bought the Sweet Baby Ray’s BBQ sauce, Brown sugar (Baker’s Corner), and a bottle of the Italian salad dressing (Tuscan Garden) from Aldis. The Worcestershire Sauce was Giant Eagle’s brand. I’m telling you, my son liked it so much he wanted a sandwich for breakfast this morning. The bun is important too... I used Brioche Buns from Aldis as well because they are delicious. Good luck!

LOVE this recipe! Super easy and tastes amazing. I used Newman farm's original BBQ sauce and 3 *fresh* chicken breast halves (halved the rest of the recipe). Also added 1/4 of a yellow onion and loved that addition. Cooked on high for 3 hours, pulled the chicken apart, and cooked on low for another hour with the lid off of my slow cooker. Had no excess moisture.

Everyone enjoyed this!  The chicken was very tender and and tasty. I used cook on high method with 6 small chicken breasts so at the end there was a lot of liquid which I’ll need to reduce next time.  Also I cut the brown sugar in half-2 tablespoons not 4.  I actually have enough left for a 2nd meal.  Overall this was very easy and very tasty.

The Italian dressing made the difference, don't omit this ingredient.

OMG y'all!! I made this tonight... changed it a tad. I added about three teaspoons of minced garlic, about a teaspoon of liquid hickory smoke.. mind you I got these ideas from reading everyone else reviews. ok. okkkay!... I let it slow cook the six hours. followed the rest of the recipe to a tea... wait!! pause!! I didn't use frozen chicken nope..., I used five pack of chicken from the grocery store, defrosted but made sure to clean it before and wash it down before I put it in the slow cooker ok.. but still.. slow cooked it and followed the recipe besides adding the garlic and smoke flavoring. after the six hours..I broke the chicken apart inside the cooker,  added the rest of the 19 oz. Jack Daniels barbecue I bought, but mixed it with a tblspoon of corn starch to thicken the sauce a bit. I think good barbecue bought sauce is the better option.  Chiiillld, it is fricken amazing tasting and so easy to make!! recommend to everyone!!  made baked potatoes on the side, swipied then down with some oil Olive and kosher salt and garlic. baked them about an hour like you know how to do... amazing!! koodos to the lady who came up with this recipe. I'm new to cooking and you just made me so happy!! I'll for sure be doing this again.. and again.. and again

I am floored at how delicious this turned out. I was afraid it would be too mushy or soupy like some had pointed out. What I did is I pressure cooked it for 30 mins (not sure of the temp, just selected “poultry” on my slow cooker). By then the chicken was already cooked, but needed to be shredded and soak in the flavors. So I slow cooked it for three hours on low... omg y’all. SO tender, SUPER flavorful!!! Not at all soupy. I made sure the sauce didn’t drown out the chicken before letting it slow cook. I wanted to use the recommended BBQ sauce but I used Jack Daniel’s hickory BBQ sauce instead :) Also thew in some chopped onions and a few slices of bacon to really amp it up. Add a buttery, toasted bun and you’re all set. I paired it with cream corn+Caesar salad. Yum X a million :)

This turned out okay.  But I should clarify that I used Kraft honey bbq sauce because that is what I had on hand.  It seemed that the sauce when it got hot became very runny and the flavor wasn't very strong.

It was amazing when cooked as instructed, but the spice was a bit much. Made it again without the Worcestershire sauce, was as good without it. It doesn't need to cook for quite as long as this recipe suggests. On high, my 1lb of chicken was finished in 3 - 4 hours.

Super easy and yummy just as written! I tried it because my son called at 1:00 in the afternoon and said he’d like to come to dinner, and I had no thawed meat. So I really did used frozen breasts, and it came out delicious!

Love this - we make it all the time!  I am not a good cook but this is so easy - it's foolproof!  A few minutes from freezer to oven and my kids love it.  I use a Le Creuset on low heat covered in the oven for four or five hours and it comes out great.

Unique taste with the Italian dressing in the barbeque sauce.  I also tried it without the Italian dressing and it was great also.
I did both one with the beer and a pot without the beer.  The ribs were tender and taste AWESOME ! Both was the hit of our party. Thanks

You know those foods that people say they "would/wouldn't write home to mother about"? This food is literally one that was talked about to mother. My fiance is a classic picky eater, and this is the recipe he told his mother about. The one he said was really good!

As a note, I used Sweet Baby Ray's Sweet and Spicy BBQ sauce.

I've used this recipe for years - it's always a fan fav. Try adding half an onion, sliced large bc they taste sooo good after slow cooking all day. Experiment with different bbq sauces for different flavors, it can be a lot of fun! Great recipe as is too!

So Simple! Wanted more so...Placed all of the 2.5 pound bag of Perdue's frozen chicken breasts in crockpot. Sprinkled salt,pepper,garlic seasoning over each side of frozen breast. 
Mixed full 18 oz. Bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce,
and recipe stated amounts of Italian Dressing,Worcestershire sauce and brown sugar in bowl.
Put liquid bbq sauce mixture into crockpot and stirred in.
Cooked on High for 3 hours.Pulled each breast into a jowl..and using 2 forks...pulled chicken.
Returned all pulled.Chicken to crockpot..Mixed and cooked an hour more on low.
Perfect! Very lean and YUMMY.!!
Made sliders with Kings Hawaiian Rolls!
EVERYONE LOVED IT!

This was such a no-brained, I just knew it couldn’t be good, but I made a test batch which we loved, then made 15 pounds of it as the sandwich meat for a potluck and everyone raves about it. When I told them how simple it was they couldn’t believe it. Served it with brioche buns and dill pickle slices. Yum.

This was tangy. The Italian dressing completely overpowered this recipe. I tried to add a little more brown sugar to counteract it and it didn't help.

I've made this a few times. Very good... I used Stubbs BBQ sauce. Made Cole slaw and BBQ soft tacos.

Can't beat this for an easy, simple recipe. I like that it uses ingredients that are commonly in the freezer and pantry already. The instructions don't say it, but shred the chicken using two forks after it is cooked. Add more BBQ sauce if desired; the mixture in the crock pot ends up fairly thin.

I pulled the chicken apart after about 4 hours to allow the flavors to get in. Then I left it on low for another 1-2 hours.

I tried just using  pulled chicken and BBQ sauce in my slow cooker and something was just missing, it was kinda bland, so I came here looking for tips and found this recipe.  My pulled BBQ chicken turned out perfect.  I made the recipe exactly as written.

I made this in my Ninja 4-in-1. I changed it a bit by sautéing half a sliced onion in the pot along with a couple of sliced hot peppers on Stovetop High for abut 3 minutes. I also thawed and seasoned my chicken. After sautéing the onion and peppers, I turn the Ninja off, added the chicken and stirred in the sauces and honey. I used a tablespoon of honey instead of 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  I set the Ninja to Slow Cook - Low and cooked the chicken for three hours (my pot was already hot). After it was done, I removed the chicken and shredded it. Meanwhile, I set the Ninja back to Stovetop High and cooked the sauce down a bit, and then added in the shredded chicken. Delicious! If you're using a really sweet barbecue sauce like Sweet Baby Ray's, you may want to cut back on the sugar a bit. I used my homemade sauce which is already sweet and using just a tablespoon of honey (as noted above) was plenty. Also, the newer slow cookers cook a lot faster than the older ones so the cooking times listed in the recipe may need adjusting if you have a newer cooker.

Easy, tasty recipe.  We all liked it, even our young son.  Made as written and no need to change.  I think that the dressing and barbecue sauce you select for this recipe will make all the difference in the taste.  We used Stubbs original sauce, which is our favorite, and it worked well.

I made this for an event at work and it turned out great.   One thing  I did differently was to season the chicken prior to inputting in crockpot (Lawry's seasoning, pepper, garlic powder).  I also prefer to use Sweet Baby Ray's barbeque sauce.

Absolutely amazing. It's one of my game day go-to's. I add some chopped onion and garlic just to give it a little extra something. I usually used Stubbs BBQ sauce. Serve it with some corn bread and coleslaw. Everyone always loves is and No one ever believes how simple and easy it is to make. 10/10

Not being a fan of anything in the kitchen, I was so surprised how awesome this recipe turned out.  The one tiny thing, which can’t be helped, is having to set my timer so I can prepare the chicken and sauce for round two in the crockpot.  Well worth every second spent on this fabulous bbq!

Sooooo good. I wish I had made it sooner. The only thing I did differently was use fresh chicken breast. I cleaned up/trimmed the chicken and then patted it dry with paper towels before putting it in the crockpot. 3hrs on high and then shredded it and went to low uncovered for about half an hour to help thicken the sauce. It is really tasty. Literally everyone was asking for seconds. I used Sweet Baby Ray’s bbq sauce and it was perfect.

I love this dish. The simplicity is only out done by the taste. I do add some garlic, but I'm prone to do that sort of thing.

I would give this more stars if i could. ?? I've made it a couple times now and have learned it's a very forgiving recipe. The first time i made it I ended up leaving it in the slow cooker way longer than i should have because our shopping trip ran long. It was still moist and tasted great. (I keep all the juice and allow the chicken to soak it all up after I've chopped it.) 

The only change i made was to use light balsamic vinaigrette as that's what i had on hand. 

This is easy to prepare and great for big groups or potlucks! Serve with coleslaw and it's a perfect summer meal.

I have made this recipe several times over the years since.  I also add about a 1/4 cup diced onion , 1/2 tsp. garlic powder, and sometimes, a sprinkling of red pepper flakes to the barbecue sauce mixture!   Great for football tailgate parties!

My kids are very picky eaters and they loved this! I used 3 thawed whole chicken breasts and cooked on high for 3 hours, shredded the chicken and then on low for 45 minutes while the chicken soaked up more of the liquid. Served on buns with sliced pickles. So good.

This was very good. I was skeptical because I've cooked chicken breasts in the crock pot before and after shredding it was somewhat dry. However I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out pretty tender and juicy. I cooked mine on low for 6 hours and then it was kept on warm for a couple more hours until I got home from work. The recipe didn't specify to shred in the pot or remove and then shred, so after seeing the amount of liquid I decided to remove the meat to a separate dish, shred, then added a scoop at a time of the liquid until it had the consistency I wanted. Considering how easy this is I'd recommend trying it.

I sprinkled my chicken with a bit chicken BBQ rub. Instead of the dressing, I added a good mount of homemade dry Italian seasoning and apple cider vinegar. I reduced the sugar, personal preference, and added liquid smoke to give it that smoked flavor.

I've made this a few times now, I always use Stubbs BBQ sauce and Zesty Wishbone dressing. Besides sandwiches, I also put the bbq chicken on salads but most of the time I just end up snacking on it cold, straight from the fridge. 
If you don't have the Italian dressing, take a packet of Italian Seasoning and mix a little water with it  and you still have the seasonings. I don't think it was quite as good when I made this change but it worked.

I made this just as the recipe called for and it came out really well.  The sauce absorbs into the chicken so it's not overly gooey and the slow cooker made it uber easy to prep!  Definitely will make this one again

Great recipe, will definitely make again.  I read a bunch of reviews and made a few adjustments, but this is a great base recipe for items already in my kitchen. 
I added diced onion and garlic to the mix, used fresh chicken breasts (not frozen) and served with Munster Cheese on Kaiser rolls topped with coleslaw. Even my picky one liked it.
 Thanks for Sharing!!

I made this dish exactly as written and it turned out great. I served with kaiser rolls. I took the advice of other reviewers and shredded the chicken after 2.5 hours (crockpot set on high) then put it on low for another 2 hours. The liquid was absorbed and it came out perfect. Thanks for this easy & tasty recipe!

I've made this a few times now. I read through reviews and took some advice. I use three large chicken breasts without changing the sauce ingredient amounts and it's a perfect ratio every time. I've used fresh and frozen chicken. I don't think it matters in terms of taste but it does change my time a little bit. Just adjust to your own typical crockpot cook times. I use a Kansas City style bbq sauce from Private Selections and wow. It is truly elevated. This is a crowd pleaser. My kids love it and ask for seconds. Even my husband who isn't a bbq fan says it's alright which is a compliment from him. I serve this on a wheat bun topped with mayonnaise, thinly sliced onions, chopped dill pickles and shredded colby jack cheese. Goes great with sides like potato salad, corn on the cob, fresh salad, etc. This makes great leftovers for lunch the next day too. I actually think it's even better the second day. Excellent recipe to add to my rotation.

I love this meal. I don't think I would do
many changes. Maybe add more barbecue. I love anything that taste like that.

Outstanding!  I doubled recipe and it worked beautifully.  Initially you think there's too much sauce but once chicken is cut up, it's just right.   (I did add 1 teaspoon of cornstarch in a small amount of water into pot before adding cut up chicken back into the slow cooker.

The only changes I made was a tad bit more barbecue sauce and a bit more Italian dressing! We loved it and have leftovers in the fridge and I'll absolutely make it again!

My whole family Loved It.  Followed the recipe exactly. Used Sweet Baby Ray BBQ Regular sauce.  As the other reviews, the sauce was not watery after you shred chicken and put back in slow cooker.  Toasted buns with garlic butter, topped sandwiches with onions and sliced sandwich pickles.  Serviced with Cole slaw and corn on cob.  Awesome meal.

I made this as written except I used only 4 very large thawed, chicken breasts.  For added flavor, I also added chopped green pepper, onion and garlic.  There was a lot of watery sauce that I had to remove and add cornstarch to so it would thicken.  That would be my only complaint about this recipe.  The flavor was good, but the sauce was too watery...and not red and saucy like other BBQ chicken.

I usually do receipes exactly as shown at least once, but I was having guests over and couldn't chance it!  I followed some suggestions from Cooking 101's review - added the green pepper, onion and broth - everyone loved it and left overs were sandwiches for the kids the next day.  Always a good sign when they ask me to make it again

This turned out better than I expected! The only alteration I made to the recipe was adding 1/2 cup each onion and celery to the sauce before putting it in the slow cooker. Plus I used zesty Italian. I served the bbq on Hawaiian rolls with a side of cole slaw and melon. I will definitely make this again when guests visit.

Loved it! I used 3 thin sliced chicken breasts that had already been defrosted and cooked them on high for about 1.5 hours. I also added some diced onions to the mixture. After the 1.5 hours, I shredded the chicken and put it back in the sauce on low for another 1.5 hours. I think shredding the chicken is key. Will absolutely make again!

After reading many reviews, I decided to go with the 4 hr/high setting. Meat wasn't dry when done. I shredded the meat an hour before it finished. This got rid of the watery sauce that was pooling at the bottom. The chicken had a nice, smokey-ish flavor to it. Didn't change/add any ingredients. Very tasty!

We loved this.  Made it with 3 large unfrozen chicken breasts, and the quantity of sauce and chicken was great!  I could shred chicken after 4 hours on low and it seemed cooked, but left it on high another couple hours till dinner time to try and thicken/caramelize the sauce.  We used Famous Dave's Bold and Sassy sauce.  Only addition I made was adding 2 teaspoons of liquid smoke.   Delicious over a baked potato.

Turned out great. I used three charge frozen breasts because I didn’t have any fresh on hand. I was out of Worcestershire sauce ?? so I used liquid smoke instead. Because I like the taste of Carolina barbecue I added two capfuls of vinegar at the end once it was shredded & it was DELISH!! Next time I’ll probably add onion but that’s about it.

This is delicious! Kids love it too. Has become part of my rotation. Seemed an odd combination of flavors at first but I am glad I tried it. I have used regular italian, also Ken's steak house light raspberry vinaigrette. Both successful.  I use Sweet Baby Ray's honey bbq sauce. Recipe makes a ton of sauce which I hate to throw out so I usually cut all ingredients in half except for the chicken   Chicken breasts tend to be dry so I often use chicken thighs instead for all slow cooker meals. Frozen cooks without an issue.

I have been making this for a couple of years and finally joined so I can leave some reviews as I rely heavily on reviews myself.

Made this the other weekend and it was great. I use sweet baby ray’s bbq sauce; it’s inexpensive and tastes great. I put it on hamburger buns for a pulled chicken meal. This is great with mashed potatoes or your favorite picnic side, I’ll be making this a lot! Can’t wait to try different bbq flavors too.

This was one of the best meals we had in a while. Going to lots of good  restaurants for past months we decided to make something just as good, and from now on my slow cooker and me are best friends. And this recipe was  so simple to make and to delicious to handle.

Easy and delicious!  I used Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ and followed the recipe as written.  I think it's important to shred the chicken and return to the pot so that it absorbs more of the wonderful flavors.  Will definitely make this one again.

I made the recipe along with half an onion and clove of garlic. It was great!  I agree with everyone else that the chicken needs to be shredded an hour before it’s done so that the entire breast is moist and flavorful.

This was amazing! I added a tiny bit of soy sauce and some of my cayenne pepper mix to really punch it up, and it tastes so good. I think this tangy chicken will become a versatile family favorite from now on.

This was delicious!!  My husband kept saying how good it was.  I only had 4 chicken breasts so it was a little bit saucier, but still great.  I wouldn't change a thing and will make it again.

This has to be one of the easiest recipes I have ever made. You don't even have to defrost your frozen chicken breasts before hand. By preparing this and your sides before hand you spend 100% of your time with your family and guests rather than in the kitchen. I served it to some friends last night and it was a big hit. Be sure to save some extra bottled BBQ sauce so your dinner guest can put it on top of their sandwich. I served it with some homemade slaw and baked beans.

Ok, this was THE easiest recipe I've EVER made so as it was cooking I was thinking of all the things I could've added and that this can only be 3-4 stars as is. I was wrong! Yes, next time if I have it I'll add an onion & some garlic powder, but I will make this again as written too. I did however only have 2 chicken breast halves so I cut the recipe by 3rds; because of this, I added 2-3 tablespoons of chicken stock to the slow cooker after adding sauce because the slow cooker was too wide for just 2 breasts & little sauce. It worked out perfectly! I do agree that you have to watch the time--I cooked it on low for 3-4 hours, then shredded it & let it cook 1-2 hours longer then turned to warm (the temp was only about 130 in the thickest part of the breast before shredding). I also used a liner for easy cleaning (I don't particularly love them, but I had some to use up). I still can't believe how easy AND how good this was. I used Open Pit "thick & tangy" BBQ sauce which gave it a smokey spicy undertone--delicious!

I made it exactly ---only difference was chicken was thawed before I put in the crock pot.  4 hours on high   Husband liked it -he said 4.5 stars  -for chicken.  I like my bbq a little on the sweeter side -not so much tang --but it was EASY--that counts for a lot in my book.    If I make it again I will cut down a little on the salad dressing (I used just cheap stuff for this) and it had LOTS of tang to it  or might just forego the dressing and add  apple cider vin. instead.  I used Baby Ray's bbq sauce.    Probably make again since most items are already in the pantry and cleanup is easy.

Started as directed and added extra sauce to serve. I put the breasts in slow cooker on high. After 2 1/2 hrs. breasts weren't completely thawed so I switched to stove top and still had it ready on time. Since breasts can be cooked fairly quickly on stove top, this will be my method with this recipe going forward. AS done, the chicken was very good. I'll make it again.

This recipe is a universal pleaser, and when I know I have picky eaters or I have unknown food palates, this always goes over very well!  I hardly make the same thing twice because I love to try new things and experiment, but I’ve been making this one for 4 years, especially when I’m trying to please any palate, universally.  Of course vegetarians aren’t on board but I always have a veggie plate or a veggie salad on the side, which really hooks me up for a happy crowd!!

I used Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce.  It was too spicy for my 6 year old who likes a little kick.  I think its perfect!  Served on Brioche buns adds a mild addition.  I would make this for a pot luck at school and seve with Kings Hawaiin rolls.  I will make it for my family again for sure.

The Italian dressing made this sauce very watery and the chicken tasted bland.  I like my barbecue to have quite a bit of flavor and this did not deliver.

Yummy!!! I made this with a few pointers from fellow AR users. Added frozen chopped onion and bell pepper, used 6 frozen chicken breast’s and a great Famous Dave’s BBQ sauce. I also “broiled” the buns in the oven. It went for about a total of 8 hours and after 6 is when we pulled it out and shredded the meat. At the end, due to the sweetness, I add some cayenne pepper. Just my choice. Then, for those who wanted it, I offered hot sauce. It was fabulous and I can’t wait to have the leftovers tomorrow! It was so moist and flavorful! Give it a try - it will be your new favorite! I know it’s replacing my old recipe!

This was delish!  I made it as is, except for a heaping tablespoon of flour to thicken it toward the end of cooking.  Reduced recipe to use only two breasts (fresh) and cooked on low for 6.5 hours.  Juicy, fully cooked and sauce not burned.  Will be making this again.

I'm not a fan of barbecue but this was awesome. I had some chicken that was already cooked and shredded so I used that. I went exactly by the directions. I used Sweet baby Ray's barbecue sauce. This is definitely a keeper!

I had a freezer full of chicken breasts from a sale, and my husband was complaining about always having chicken and asked me for something else, anything else, as long as it wasn't chicken. This recipe was so good, not only did he stop complaining,  but he didn't even think it was chicken. After shredding, I like to let it soak in the sauce on warm for an hour or so after. It's even better the next day. You can use this recipe with boneless skinless chicken thighs too, or a mixture of thighs and breasts. My chicken-hating husband asks for this all the time now. He thinks it's pulled pork.

I used thawed chicken & place in crockpot. Mix up the rest ingredients in bowl & pour over chicken, cooking on low for 3 to 4 hrs. Take chicken out & shred or cut into pieces adding back to sauce, and cook one hour more. I added 1/2 cup chopped onions, 3 garlic cloves, used Jack Daniels BBQ sauce, & served over rice. Absolutely fantastic meal that my family loves & everyone gets the recipe from me. Thanks

Perfect summer afternoon recipe.  Throw everything in a crockpot, spend the day gardening, then come back inside to  the smell of bbq'd chicken.

I have made this several times over the last 6 years since I found the recipe, but after the first try, I left out the Italian dressing. It just takes away the bbq flavor.

Very good chicken, I added some red peppers and slivered onions, also added some italian sausage, tasted great!!

Will make more of this yummy food soon.  My company loved the chicken so well, I made an extra batch to put in my freezer.

Followed the recipe exactly.  Used  good brand sauce and dressing as recommended by reviewers.  Was not impressed by this recipe.  Final product tasted rather bland to me and my husband.

I added a can of crushed tomatoes, 1 finely chopped onion,  no brown sugar,  half the amount of BBQ sauce. This reduced the amount of sugar and still tasted BBQ sauce.

Great recipe!  The only changes I made were using fresh breasts and I  shredded the chicken after 3 hours on high. The flavor was very good but the sauce was a little runny. I will definitely make this again but next time I will use some of a packet of Italian dressing mix instead of actual dressing. That will cut down on the calories and liquid but leave the great flavor. Thanks for a new regular recipe in my rotation!!

It was alright but seems to be lacking in flavor.  I will try it again and add a few more ingredients to give it more flavor.  Bland is my word for this recipe.

I realized later that I  had used already  baked chicken and recipe was for frozen uncooked chicken.  I probably  didn't need to leave it in slow cooker as long as I did.....but still, so good!

Very good barbecued chicken. I shredded the chicken breasts 1/2 way through the cooking time as suggested in the video and it was worth the effort. This one is a keeper. I may try chicken thighs the next time I make it.

This was a hit with the family (even for my wife who normally doesn't like chicken cooked in the slow cooker). Made it the same way as the original recipe, but I did shred the meat at the three hour mark (like other posters mentioned).

I actually made a few revisions to the recipe mainly using sweet baby ray's buffalo wing sauce instead of barbecue sauce because I wanted some hot flavor to it and turned out a hit! I put the whole 16 oz. content and adjusted the measurement for the Italian dressing, brown sugar and Worcestershire sauce and still turned out fine. Using the crock pot liner made cleaning easier as well! I will definitely cook this again!

Omg -- happy dancing over here! Not only did my very picky family love it but so did one of my kids fiends that was here for a play date!! I'm 100% amazed that no one complained and all had seconds! So easy to make and so easy to clean up! Already shared the recipe with my friend whose daughter was here since she loved it so much! I wish I had taken a picture, but it was all eaten up so fast! Besides, I truly expected everyone to complain like usual. So happy to be wrong about that. Thanks for this great recipe!

I find this recipe to be very forgiving-- I used whatever sauces were in the fridge (but didn't skimp or cheap out on the BBQ sauce), and both times I made it were great. I used chicken breasts the first time and thighs the second-- I preferred the taste of the thighs. Be sure to check at semi-regular intervals to avoid overcooking. This also reheats very well-- I made big batch then had it for the next three days' lunches with sweet and sour pickles on the side.

This was so easy!  I read a lot of reviews 1st.  I used 4 large defrosted breasts, sprinkled them with garlic salt and put them in the crock pot with about 1/3 cup chicken broth and cooked them on high for 3 hours.  I then drained the chicken broth, shredded the chicken (it fell apart), returned to the crock pot with the bbq sauce (I omitted the brown sugar for fear it would be too sweet) and turned it to low for another hour.  This is a good solid bbq recipe and gets 4 stars bc it was sooo easy!!

My husband loved this meal. The only thing is, I was confused as to what to do with the leftover juice/BBQ sauce. I dumped it out so ended up adding more BBQ sauce when we ate it so it was saucier. The directions were clear about that part. Otherwise, it was a GREAT hit at our house! It made a ton so we ate if over three nights and one lunch (there are only two of us and my husband is a hearty eater!). Yummy!

Next, time I make it  I will  use less BBQ sauce.  It did have have a really good flavor.  Thought is was a little to runny.

So easy, and so delicious.  I only used 3 large chicken breasts,  so I reduced the sauce accordingly, and used only a spoonful of brown sugar.   I cooked it for 3 hours on high, shredded the chicken and put it back in the pot.  Great!

The next time I would leave out the brown sugar- if you use certain brands of bbq sauce the #1 ingredient is sugar. I will make it again- it was good

My husband is not a "chef".  As a matter of fact, he just retired and just started cooking to assist me around the house.  I chose this recipe for him to try and I was shocked!  It was SOOOOO Good!  We only had three chicken breasts so we cut the ingredients in half.  He first simmered in chicken in chicken broth with garlic, pepper, and "maybe" other spices.  He then drained it then added the listed ingredients.  He cut the brown sugar by more than a half.  Also, he used the Sweet Baby BBQ and Olive Garden dressing.  If a rookie can do this, anyone can.  Try it!  It's so good!

Great Recipe. I would suggest not adding the sauce mixture immediately, waiting until the chicken is 30-60 minutes done from cooking, draining the excess chicken juice, and then adding the sauce. This way, it's not so watery while still being nice and juicy.

I keep forgetting to rate this family favorite.  I have a huge crock pot so I easily double the recipe.  Make sure to use quality bbq sauce (I use Sweet Baby Ray's  Sweet Vadalia Onion sauce).   So easy and everyone in my family and extended family love this recipe.  I have taken it to pot-luck events and every time have been asked for the recipe by several people, especially the guys.  No one can believe it is this easy to make and turns out so delish.

Amazing! I used rotisserie chicken (white meat) and cooked it in the crock pot. I used Sweet Baby Rays original BBQ sauce and Olive Garden Italian Dressing. It turned out phenomenal. My family loved it. I will be making this regularly.

Everyone loves this recipe!!! I use fresh chicken breast portions and v-good quality BBQ sauce & dressing. Shred chicken in crock using two forks. Allow to rest & soak up sauce/ juices. We enjoy on potato bread slider rolls @ gatherings. I like to serve with Sweet Restaurant Slaw from this site .

This was amazing, cooked the first 2 hours of mine in chicken broth, garlic, salt and pepper on high, drained it and cooked with the rest of the ingredients for 1 1/2 hour more. Used a combo of Big Al's KC BBQ sauce recipe and olive garden Italian dressing, sticking it on homemade buns and topped with havarti cheese and pickles made it taste exactly like a better Chick Fil' A sandwich, with bbq instead of bird flavor to boot. Definitely a new favorite.

I made my own barbecue sauce and my own Italian dressing  and the outcome was awesome! My only problem was I didn't read the directions prior to defrosting my chicken breasts. Consequently theshredding was a bit harder but everyone loved their pulled chicken barbecue sandwiches

I cooked chicken frozen and my family ended up in the hospital with food poisoning.  If the chicken is spoiled the sauce would hide the odor.  I suggest thawing chicken first.

We love this recipe!  It's very easy and very flavorful.  The first time I made it exactly as it is written.  My husband went crazy and requested that I make it weekly just to have it on hand!  My son said it was too tangy for him, but I left out the Italian dressing the second time I made it and he just loves it!  Now I have to double it and keep it in the fridge for them to grab throughout the week.

My husband and I liked this a lot. I am just starting to use the slow cooker more frequently and this was super easy and delicious. I'd like to try it again with more organic or at least less preservatives in the dressings I added.

Everyone in my house loved it - I'm incapable of following a recipe exactly, so I added some additional spices, garlic, a little smoked paprika a dash of cayenne pepper, but other than that it was great on its own and for sandwiches and sliders.

I miss read that the chicken breast were supposed to be frozen, so I made the sauce and marinated the chicken over night. Since it wasn't frozen I had it cook on low for only 3-4hours. turned out perfect. This os a new family favorite. will be making this more often.

Used 3 huge chicken breasts.  Made the sauce exactly as written.  Cooked on high for 4 hours then shredded the chicken, added a tbsp of flour to thicken, and cooked on low for about another hour.  The sauce thickened up nicely.  Served on buttered & broiled whole wheat hamburger buns with a slice of smoked provolone.  OMG, this was absolutely delicious!  Used Sweet Baby Ray's honey bbq sauce and cheap-o Italian dressing.  Definitely a keeper!

May have been better with a better BBQ sauce. We used Hickory & Brown Sugar Sweet Baby Rays and the result was very sweet.

What do you do when you are under the weather and still want to make dinner? I felt awful but I had to make 4 chicken breasts before they walked out of the frig by themselves. The breasts were large, bone-in and the skin had not been removed. I just threw them in the cooker just as they were. I didn't have Italian dressing on hand so I used some balsamic dressing I did have. I cooked it 6 hours on low. The sauce came out thinner than I wanted (an easy fix) but the chicken was wonderful! I served the chicken and sauce over rice along with some baked cabbage. I will make again. This recipe has possibilities and is a keeper.

My boyfriend loves anything BBQ so no surprise he loved it. I followed the recipe but used 3 thawed breasts, and I let those cook by themselves on high for 3 hours then I drained the juices shredded the chicken and returned to crock pot with the mixture. I just used a generic sauce (it was all I had on hand) Next time I'll try a different sauce and see if that makes a difference

I made a double portion. I used boneless thighs. I added minced garlic,  and onion powder.  Served it on buns and had sliced tomatoes, pickles and diced onions for toppings. Brought to work and my coworkers loved it.

I followed the recipe exactly and it wasn't anything special, sauce didn't really stick to the chicken and it ended up just tasting bland and acidic. I still ate it, but I've had much better. I think this recipe should specify the brand of BBQ sauce and italian dressing used, I expect that would make a big difference. I used Jack daniels original and Ken's italian dressing.

This came out very good and instead of brown sugar I added chipotle sauce. I didn't have whosteshire sauce so I just left it out without a replacement. 
Everyone wanted the recipe. We'll almost everyone. Lol

This is an easy recipe that tastes great for all ages, and makes chicken for days...  The only alterations I made were to cook the chicken in chicken broth for 4 hours on high heat.  Then I pulled the chicken out to shred and discarded the broth in the slow cooker.  I then mixed in an 18 oz. jar (rather than the 16 oz. jar) of Stubb's Original BBQ sauce, because my chicken breasts looked really big.  It was perfect.  They were wet, but not over-sauced.  Delicious.  We ate on hoagie rolls with provolone as sandwiches. I made wraps out of it for lunch, and even stuck them on Nachos for the Super Bowl.  Delicious.

I used 6 chicken breasts, they were not frozen and I cooked them on high in chicken broth, onions and garlic for 4 hours, I then removed the chicken, shredded it and then dumped the chicken broth adding in the Italian Dressing,  worcestershire,  and Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce and cooked for another hour.  Came out perfect!

Exceptional.  Easy to fix.  Kid friendly.  My only changes were to use a full bag (40 oz) of the frozen chicken breasts and the full bottle (18 oz) of BBQ sauce (Sweet Baby Ray's Sweet and Spicy).

This was SO freaking good! However, I didn't follow the recipe lol!! I just put the frozen chicken in and the BBQ sauce only. I used 4 frozen chicken breasts and 1 whole cup of BBQ sauce. I let it cook on high for 3 or 4 hrs, until it tore apart easy with a fork. Will definitely be making this again.

I made this today and everyone loved it. I read Audrea's Review and followed and everything worked out great.  Like she did, I cooked the chicken halve breast’s in the crockpot on High for 3 hours and then shredded the chicken right in the crockpot with mixer.  Stirred everything up and cooked on low for 1 hour.  

One thing you may like is I used the Honey Wheat Sandwich Thins and it was excellent.  The sandwich thins are 100 calories for 2 (3 weight watcher Points).  Enjoy!!

So, so yummy! My hubby loved it. We used Hawaiian rolls and topped the chicken with coleslaw. I'll be making this for Super Bowl :)

This was excellent.  I made it for friends and they thought it was delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly, but did use slightly less sugar.  I did double the recipe and cooked it  on high for 4 hours.  Removed the chicken, shredded it, added a little more sauce to the crockpot, along with the chicken and let it cook an additional hour.  Served on bakery hamburger rolls.  Will definitely make again.

I used chicken tenders and used whole bottle 18oz)of sweet baby Ray BBQ sauce. I didn't have a onion but used minced onion.  I cooked on low 5 hours then high the last hour. I did not use the Italian dressing as I know my hubby would have not liked it. This made his favorite list.  I will try liquid smoke next time and add a diced onion.  Also will put on a Hawaii roll instead of bread because that was all we had at time.

My boyfriend absolutely loved this! I did not use frozen chicken, I defrosted it beforehand and put it in the slow cooker on high for 3 hours, then shredded, and let it cook for a little more. I used Sweet Baby Ray's original sauce, and since it's pretty sweet already, I only used one tablespoon of brown sugar as opposed to two.

I agree, cook fresh chicken first with stock,  onion and garlic.  Good idea about Jack Daniels BBQ sauce.  Second time did not add the brown sugar.  Much better without the sweet taste.  Wanted to use with black beans with left overs but no left overs!

I've made this four times so far. I usually make it when friends come over and I need something I can cook while doing other things. This recipe is AWESOME! The chicken turns out tender and juicy every time! It's a crowd pleaser for very little effort.

This was one of the first slow cooker recipes I've made, and it was certainly the simplest. I'm not a bbq fan myself, but my significant other loved it. The only complaint he had was the bbq was too watery... if there was a good way to thicken it up it would have been perfect.

I will be making this again in the future though!

I made a few changes to this recipe based off of other reviews that I read. I added 1/2 cup of smokey BBQ sauce and reduced the amount of maple syrup as I don't like too much sweet stuff in my food. I used frozen chicken breasts and cooked on high for 4 hrs then turned to low for another 4 hrs. Doubled the sauce recipe and put 1/4 aside - used some to put directly on the sandwich buns. It turned out great for my pot luck luncheon at work. It was the first crock pot to be emptied. All my colleagues have asked for the recipe and raved about how good it was! I will definitely be using this recipe for other types of meat as well. It will be in my recipe box from now on. Was so simple to make and great tasting! Not too sweet or sticky like some other recipes I've tried!

My husband is a very picky eater and more so when it comes to sauces with his food and he loved it.  It was really easy to make, I didn't use frozen chicken breast and it still was really moist and good. I used Jack Daniels BBQ Sauce and it gave it the right flavor! Will make again.

I used half the amount of brown sugar. Cooked on high for three hours with half of Jack Daniels barbecue original recipe,  then I proceeded to shred the chicken, add the other half of barbecue and cooked on low for two more hours. Everybody loved it.

I used 4 fresh chicken breasts.  I had a bottle of Kraft Honey Barbeque sauce (about 20 ounces left) so used that.  I omitted the brown sugar, added garlic, liquid smoke and other ingredients as directed.  I cooked on low for about three hours; wasn't quite done so switched to high for about two more hours, then shredded the chicken.  The best barbeque!  Husband and I both loved it.

Definitely will make again, only used 2 large boneless chicken breasts, kept sauce the same for 6, put in 1/2 for the 3 hours on high, drained half the juice,  shredded and cooked on med. for a lil over an hour with the remaining sauce.  added salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion flakes to the chicken and sauce.   Broiled the buns ! Very good!

I used G Hugh's Sugar Free Hickory barbecue sauce, added about two tablespoons liquid smoke, and Truvia low cal brown sugar.  Cooked low for seven hours. two hours before serving, shredded chicken.  I added two tablespoons of cornstarch an hour before serving because it looked runny.  Buttered roll, sprinkled garlic powder, added two slices of provolone, and toasted in oven.   My children loved it even though I made it low sugar.

I made this for the first time on Father's Day for Mine and my husbands parents. Everyone loved it so much, they asked for the recipe. Since then I have made it for other family members and for my co-workers at a holiday party. I recommend this recipe to anyone who loves a good BBQ.

taste is awesome.  used sweet baby rays hickory bbq sause and house italian.  however...it did not fall apart quite the way pulled pork does.  you can pull it apart but it did not get that super stringy texture that is so amazing for pulled/bbq meats.

cooked it on high for 3 hours then low for 2.  any tips?

This recipe was good, but not amazing. The picture showed a pulled chicken in a bun. What we ended up with didn't just pull apart. The flavour was good, but I was really hoping to make a pulled chicken sandwich.

This recipe was exact! I had no issues with it at all. The prep time and cook time were very accurate. You may need to adjust your cook time if you are cooking in an older crockpot, but my new one did great. I used zesty italian dressing and sweet baby rays original for bbq sauce. Have to say this is the best recipe I have found for BBQ

very good and super easy.  made as directed.  after cooking over night in a crockpot on low for a new years day brunch, I removed the chicken and shredded it and let hte sauce cook down in a skillet to thicken and then put everything back in the crock pot. will definitely make again.  friends asked for the recipe.

My family loved this barbecue chicken. I made a few changes to the recipe. I used three boneless chicken breasts that I thawed almost completely in the microwave prior to placing in the crock pot. I also did not have Italian dressing on  hand so I substituted with the ranch dressing i did have. I figured this would also aid in thickening the sauce. I did not use top of the line barbecue sauce. I used Kraft slow simmered mesquite smoked barbecue sauce because this is what I had on hand. I cooked the chicken in the crock pot with the sauce mixture for 3 hours on high. I then shredded the chicken and placed it back into the crock pot, stirring well. Set it for 1 hr  on low.  The sauce was perfect. Served it on flat bread with sharp cheddar cheese. This made enough for three people with leftovers.

This came out really well. I used 4 chicken breast (so 8 breast halves) which was fine since I had an 18 oz bottle of Stubbs BBQ sauce.. I upped the amounts on the other ingredients just a bit. I had it on low in the crockpot for about 4.5 hours then took out the chicken halves and shredded them. I added it back to the crockpot for another hour or so that way the shredded chicken could soak up the sauce. Put it on sandwich rolls with some coleslaw. Absolutely amazing meal which both my husband and I really enjoyed.

Delicious! I like mine a bit "saucier", so I used four (fresh) chicken breasts, 18oz of barbecue sauce and 3/4 C (Olive Garden) Italian Dressing.  Because the chicken was fresh, I cooked on low for three hours, shredded the chicken, then cooked on low for one more hour. That night we put the chicken on rolls and topped with ranch or bleu cheese dressing. The following night we made quesadillas with the chicken, adding shredded cheddar.  Easy and flavorful.

I made this recipe as written (except I used thawed chicken breasts), wanted to love it due to the reviews, but was really underwhelmed.  I used Montgomery Inn barbecue sauce.  Like another reviewer, I added some Wondra flour to thicken the watery sauce, (I did shred the chicken 3/4 way through) and felt I needed to keep adding more barbecue sauce to get the flavor boost.  I will try this again, but with adjustments.  One suggestion - add some sliced banana peppers or pickles to your sandwich, it really "brings it home".

Having been  member of All Recipes for years, when I read this recipe, was sure it would be a hit for Christmas Eve 2016.  Rarely, however, do I try anything new for such an important occasion.

Changed recipe slightly. Added more chicken.  Used Masterpiece BBQ sauce as this is our favorite.  After cooking and shredding chicken ... there was way too much sauce so I took out half of sauce and returned chicken to crock pot.  Served on homemade hoagie buns.  This was a hit to say the least.  Definitely will make this again ... won't wait for Christmas either.  

Note:  Always use good ingredients; good sauce, good dressing, etc.

i have made this several times.  this is a 5 star recipe that you can make your own. the flavor changes with the type of dressing and BBQ sauce. i get a zesty or regular italian dressing. i like Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce the best. this is one of the few dinners where everybody eats like a piggy!!! thank you!

Great recipe for game night or a pot luck.  You MUST know your slow cooker.  They are not created equal and some cook way too hot even at the lowest setting.  Put some water in your slow cooker on low setting.  If it boils,  your slow cooker is too hot.  Chances are you've overcooked a lot of dishes in it.

This recipe should be a snap, if you have a slow cooker with adequate temp control.

Wonderful recipe! I used bogarts bbq sauce  (restaurant in STL but I think dierbergs carries it now).  It was awesome. The second time I tried jack Daniels bbq sauce since people raved about it. I did not care for it as much so I added sweet baby rays to it which is loved by my family, and it once again tasted marvelous. It's obviously just a difference in taste preference but nonetheless, the ease of making this dish is another reason its my favorite! I only used 1 tablespoon of brown sugar and I've used the dry Italian dressing mix with 1 cup water or the already made Italian dressing. Either works fine.

did as directed, the Italian dressing just hits the spot. I was afraid this is going to turn out too bbq-y but it was just right.
kids loved it. mine cooked on high for 4 hours. I was able to shred the chicken after 3 hours and not half way

The recipe makes alot. Be sure to adjust the amounts to fit your needs. Also, using your favorite BBQ sauce or a different sauce each time will give it a little different variety.

So, so good!  Changed quantity to 3 servings as I only had 2 chicken breast halves.  Defrosted chicken then followed recipe exactly as written. Cooked on low and shredded chicken about an hour before serving.  Shredded chicken absorbed excess sauce very nicely. Served on toasted hoagie rolls.  Next time will serve over baked potatoes as someone else suggested.

My daughter and I loved it!! I made my own Italian dressing and BBQ sauce due to a need for low sodium so I can only imagine how delicious it would be with regular sauce.

One star at best, as written. Added Sriracha sauce to leftovers and served on hamburger buns. 1,000% improvement!

This is a great recipe! The only change i did was seasoning the chicken breast with black pepper and garlic salt. A great hit at my house!!! Definitely adding this to our menu.

We loved this chicken. It was very flavorful. The only thing I did different was to add molasses.  We were out of brown sugar.
We had baked potatoes and broccoli with the chicken.
I will certainly  make this again.

On crockpot dishes that tend to get watery--fold together about four paper towels and put under the lid.  It will absorb extra moisture.

I prefer to use all organic products whenever possible. There are no really good organic barbecue sauces on the market, so I make my own. I use organic chicken breasts and thighs for this recipe.

Loved this recipe! I followed Cooking 101s advice and bought a good BBQ sauce (Jack Daniel's Honey BBQ) and slow cooked my chicken breasts in broth beforehand. Turned out great! This is a sweet recipe rather than vinegar-y. My husband likes it a little more on the spicy side, so next time I might chop up a pepper or two in addition.

Simple and clean, a very easy recipe for our favourite easy cooking tool, the slow cooker.  Taking the advice of Cooking101, I cooked my chicken for 6 hours in chicken broth.  However, I did adjust the recipe slightly by seasoning my chicken with italian dressing dry powder mix, as I was lacking in the liquid dressing.  Otherwise, I proceeded with the dish as normal and found it to be a tasty and easy meal.  If I would offer any advice, it's that the sauce is going to make buns a soggy mess in a hurry, so you'd do well to either broil 'em a bit before serving or choosing a base that holds together longer!

An absolute favorite. My husband could not stop eating these. They are a bit sweet for me. I think I'll pull back a bit on the sugar next time. I used SBR BBQ sauce and since it was honey flavored it seemed too sweet. My husband thought it was perfect. Super tender! I used the bone in breasts, then pulled the meat off and left it another hr. In the crock pot.

I was disappointed in the lack of flavor given the ingredients.  I had to add salt to the chicken even after it cooked all day in the sauce.  It was dry and the sauce was just missing something.  The best part were the King Hawaiian rolls I served it on.  Took this off my favorites immediately after dinner.

Perfect! I used fresh chicken and marinated it overnight, then popped it in the slow cooker while leaving for work. Left in on low and when I came home it was so tender! Just pulled right apart just like the video!

Oh my. Everyone I make this for LOVES it! One trick that really helps with keeping flavor potent, is to add only about 1/3 of the sauce ingredients initially. Then, after the chicken is cooked through, take out the chicken pieces only. Dump the liquid. (As the chicken cooks, it releases a lot of water which waters down the flavor and makes the sauce very runny.) Shred the chicken and put back in the crock pot on warm, then add the remaining 2/3 of the sauce ingredients, stir and it's ready whenever you are.

I made it per the recipe except for salting and peppering the chicken and sprinkling with chopped garlic.  Used KC Masterpiece Private Stock Reserve Sauce.   Use a good quality bottled sauce for best results.  I also used boneless thighs since we like them better than breasts and they stay moister.

I did as Cooking 101 suggested.   I cut the recipe in half and cooking the frozen, trimmed breasts in chicken broth with Nature season, poultry season and garlic powder for 6 hours on low.  I poured off the broth, added remaining ingredients and cooked on low for another 2 hours.  My youngest daughter and myself liked it.  My picky oldest daughter did not.  I am freezing the leftovers and when I reheat it I will saute some onions and garlic before adding the leftovers.  Overall, a good recipe.  Changes are based on personal taste.  Thank you.

I thought this was very good; however, it was also submitted by Zanne Peters--the exact recipe. I read the reviews and did add diced onion and some minced garlic.  I also took the suggestion of reviewers to shred the chicken and it will absorb the sauce and that worked out so well, there was no need to add the cornstarch! The meat absorbed all the liquid.  I liked the idea of the reviewers who suggested serving over a baked potato and will try that tomorrow as I have plenty of leftovers.

LOVED this! I've been on allrecipes.com for about 100 years and this is the first time I'm leaving a review because this is going to be in my faves file for sure! I even simplified it by just putting in fresh chicken breasts (4 large) and then just dumped the sauce ingredients on top of the chicken (eliminating having to wash a separate bowl) and turned on high for 4 hours. It all melded together and sauce seemed too thin until I shredded the chicken and then it was perfect! I am not a fan of leftovers but I brought a container to work today and it's so good I'm eating it cold! But for dinner, we had it on nice hamburger rolls and some of us topped with cheese and pickles. Would be good with some slaw on top and a side of baked beans. I think you could make it more complicated with onions and garlic and others stuff but it isn't needed if you want a quick easy dinner that tastes awesome!

Love this recipe.  For the person who said the cooking time was too long...I have a hint.  Take the lid off the crock pot every now and then and check the chicken.  Whether the recipe says it takes 4-6-8 hours...when it done, its done.  That's when you unplug the slow cooker.  I cant say for sure but I would be willing to bet that actual temperature ranges vary from brand to brand. I'm sorry but it is common sense.

We were having a crowd so we doubled the amounts.  Also to fit all that chicken in the crock pot we cut each breast into 3 pieces.  I followed the sauce exactly as written (doubled) and it was great!  The hardest part was shredding all that chicken but it was well worth watching people come back for seconds.

I'm always looking for recipes calling for frozen chicken breasts, un-thawed, because I never remember to thaw. That said, I did use fresh chicken breasts this time and cooked on HIGH for 3 1/2 hours, shredded, then left on LOW for about another hour. Soaked up a lot of the sauce and was really flavorful! I followed the recipe exactly, I made my own Italian dressing from a seasoning packet because I was out of bottled, and used Jack Daniel's Original BBQ sauce: I agree with other reviewers, the BBQ sauce is an important choice! We will be using the leftovers for something tasty! Thanks for the simple, easy and delicious recipe. Yummy!

Used frozen chicken breasts and cooked on high for 4 hours. Didn't have Worcestershire on hand so I added a splash of red wine vinegar and an extra pinch of salt. I took out the chicken about 3.5 hours in and shredded it. While the chicken was out, I added 3 tablespoons of flour to thicken up the sauce, beware of pesky clumps though. Then I put the shredded chicken back in to soak up that flavor. After a taste I decided to add some crushed red pepper flakes to add some heat (I'd recommend).

Quick and easy and tasty too. I loved that I had a use for my frozen chicken breasts because many times if I freeze meat, it doesn't get used. My husband is always critical of slow-cooker meals, but he loved this. I made it exactly as listed in the recipe. Next time, I'll make some modifications to see if I can make it without the BBQ sauce so the chicken can be used for a variety of meals. There are a lot of leftovers so if I could spin it Mexican after, it would be perfect.  Not sure if that will come out as juicy though. Oh and some people commented that they don't use frozen breasts in the slow cooker but this was my first time and I did it on low for 9 hours and texture/doneness was great. My slow cooker seems to run hot so a lot of times my chicken comes out dry or gummy at the end when using fresh chicken breasts.

This is such a hit! I use fresh chicken breasts (not frozen) and sprinkle a little garlic powder on them before going into the slow cooker. I always use Sweet Baby Ray’s barbecue sauce and Kraft Zesty Italian dressing. Add a dash of cayenne pepper for a little kick! Cooked on high for 3-4 hours. Make sure to shred the chicken halfway through and had back to the sauce to really amp up the flavor and absorb well. Goes great on toasted Brioche buns with giardiniera peppers, if desired!

I tossed a whole chicken  in the slow cooker, 6 hours later shredded it and added it along with the rest of the ingredients  to the slow cooker to mingle. This was easy and fantastic. Something I can make when all of my children and grandchildren  come over. Thanks!

Family favorite! My friend sent me this recipe and I'm so happy that she did. I use 4 boneless skinless breasts, unfrozen. My kids even eat this so it's a huge bonus. And great for picnics or family gatherings.

I seasoned bone in thighs and cooked on high for 4 hours, then shredded and put back in for 1 1/2 hrs on low.  Good flavor but too sweet

My boyfriend and I love this recipe. I didn't have the Worcestershire sauce, so I used a sprinkle of soy sauce and lemon juice. I used Hunts Original BBQ sauce. Cooked low for 7 hours and turned out fantastic! I served on potato roll, but it is great to eat by itself too. With a side of corn bread, this recipe is easy and great!

Fantastic.  I did this the fast way.  I just dumped everything in my pressure cooker, locked the lid, set the timer for 45 minutes, and walked away.  Once the 45 minutes of pressure was up, I shredded the chicken in the pot and cooked on "low temp" for 15 minutes to allow the sauce to absorb in and thicken.   Wonderful, easy dinner that only requires 10 minutes of actual work.  

This recipe works with chicken, pork, or beef.  I use 45 minutes for chicken, 50 for pork, and 60 for beef.  All the other ingredients remain the same.  To make the pork and beef cook better and more evenly, I slice the roast against the grain into 1 inch slabs.  A pork roast is my favorite with this recipe.  We eat it on buns one night, and over baked potatoes the next.

Very moist and good, but a little too tangy for my family and myself. We added more BBQ sauce after, to get rid of the tangy taste. If you are not into tangy BBQ sauce, maybe add more BBQ sauce, and less Italian dressing when making this recipe.

We didn't care for this one. I think the dressing gives it a weird flavor. Just wasn't our thing.

I followed the instructions about cooking the chicken in broth seasoned with onions and garlic salt but also added some Italian dressing.  I left it to cook about 5 hours on low.  Drained everything, resurved the onions and Chix;  shredded the chicken. 
Put the Chix back in the crock pot, added Italian Dressing and "Home made" barbecue sauce. It was wonderful !! I'll definitely make this again!
Cooked on low for another hour

I will definitely make it again.  It was awesome!  Zesty, but sweet.  I used Sweet Baby Rays Honey Chipotle BBQ sauce and turbinado sugar because I didn't have brown.  I added about a Tbsp. of garlic powder and cut up one jalapeño and threw it in.  We ate it on toasted brioche buns with pepper jack cheese... yum!

My wife, kids and I all love this recipe.  I follow the recipe exactly as is with only 1 minor variation; I don't always use chicken breast halves. I use whatever boneless chicken I happen to have on hand, such as breast tenderloins.  If you use tenderloins, you don't have to cook it quite as long. It always comes out delicious.  My family prefers to eat this chicken on Hawaiian rolls or dinner rolls.

This is my very first slow cooker recipe . I thaw out the chicken  and seasoned  it with salt and pepper.  Cooked  on high for 3hrs total. The video said to shred the chicken after an hour and a half. The chicken looked fully cook but was a bit hard to shred in the croc pot. Didn't want to scratch my new croc pot so I did it on a plate.  A lot of people suggested Sweet Baby Ray honey BBQ sauce. Wow we're they right came out great.

This was so easy!  I didn't have regular italian dressing, so I added some olive oil, vinegar and seasoning that would be in that.  We used Stubb's BBQ sauce as well, and it was delicious.

Delicious! Easy! I used honey instead of brown sugar and I love it! Chicken falling apart, sauce is delicious. Cooked overnight for 8 hours on low. I seasoned the chicken with garlic powder, onion powder, seasoning salt, and pepper. Nothing else added

I've made this 3 times and love it.  Yesterday I make it and took someones advice and added one small chopped onion.  Made all the difference in the world.  Great improvement.  I only use Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce and this is so perfect.

This was perfect! I didn't change a thing in the recipe. Cooked on low in the crock pot for 8 hours - the chicken was so tender and the sauce was delicious. Very simple to make (especially if you have frozen chicken you want to use). I will def be making this one again!

Excellent. I would recommend using Sweet Baby Ray's and cutting the brown sugar. I added a few splashes of cider vinegar, three cloves of garlic, onion powder, salt, pepper and some hot sauce to spice it up a little bit. 

Cooking times are off. I scoured the comments here and what worked best for me (Fall apart chicken pulling it out of the pot to shred) was doing 4 hours on low, pulling the chicken and shredding, then returning to pot. I cranked the heat up to a medium and left the lid ajar and cooked for an additional hour or so. If you need to you can sprinkle a teaspoon or so of corn starch to thicken it up if you prefer. 

Came out excellent. It's going into the regular rotation for sure.

I have made this twice, following the recipe for the most part.  Last time I didn't use as much chicken as the first time (I think I used 4 chicken breasts first time) and the recipe works better with the 4 chicken breasts for my family.  Makes it, predictably, less saucy.  Also I cooked on high this last time, which left some parts burnt.  So, next time I'll err on the side of MORE chicken and cooking it longer on Low.  The flavor is great, and I'm never buying the pre-packaged barbecue chicken again.  I'm sure this is cheaper, and probably healthier.

I used 9 chicken breasts (not frozen) but didn't change the other ingredients. On the advice of another review, I cooked in the crock pot on high for 3 hours, shredded the chicken then set on low for 1 more hour. This recipe was very quick and easy. My husband and teenage boys loved it and asked me to make it again.

Made it using Sweet Baby Rays BBQ  original bbq sauce. Turned out quite good, though 1 cup of the zesty italian dressing was a bit much for my taste and that was combined with an 18oz bottle of bbq sauce. Will try using somewhere between 1/2 cup and 3/4 cup the next time.

These were delicious. I made this and we had sliders. My son loves it and he doesn't like anything. I seasoned my chicken with my special seasoning, and I added a little more BBQ sauce. I will definitely make this again.

In all fairness, I had half the amount of chicken and cut down on other liquid ingredients and in hind site shouldn't have. Time cooked too long...it burned. IF I  try again will be more liquids and shorter time.

If you like to keep things simple,like me, then you will love this recipe. I have made it three times now and always follow the exact recipe. Today I made it with the frozen chicken, for the first time. I used the slow cooker on high for four hours and it turned out perfectly. If you use thawed chicken then you might want to decrease the cooking time.

I just recently started eating meat again after being a vegetarian for 10 years. This recipe not only got me into chicken again but my boyfriend can't get enough of it! I make this for two people and it's gone in a few days. I used simple truth organic bbq sauce and it came out perfect. I also pulled the chicken an hour before the time was up and it helped soak up all the juice. Perfect ratio of sauce to chicken.

As per reviews, I made sure to use a good quality BBQ - actually made my own (Neeley's BBQ from Food Network) and made Italian dressing (Good Seasons).  Thawed, not frozen,  chicken breasts and tossed in about 1/2 a large Vidalia onion sliced thin and 4 cloves chopped garlic.  3 1/2 hours on high to cook, shredded chicken, let warm for about 30 minutes.  Then piled on cottage buns and with added mayo-based coleslaw and it was delicious!   Served the next day with potato skins - yum!!

I did things a little different as I always do I didn't use the salad dressing I used 2 tbs extra dark soy sauce and 1/4 cup lemon with a 3/4 cup of water and 5 Jalapeno pepper's and it came out fantastic!

This recipe is the best!  

And, I've eaten a lot of barbecue this summer because the dog ate the recipe that I had written down so I've been trying to recreate it.  

I like leftovers so made about 1.5 times the amount.  There was not a shred of chicken left.

i have made this multiple times over the last couple of years and have always gotten rave reviews about it.  As others have said you HAVE to use a good quality BBQ sauce. If you do use frozen chicken it probably will be a little watery as the chicken releases more moisture than if you use thawed or fresh chicken. One solution I have found is to cook the frozen chicken with about half the BBQ sauce until it shreds easily, empty at least half of the liquid, shred chicken, and then put it back in the slow cooker with the remainder of the BBQ sauce for at least an hour on low. One of the changes I have made over the years is that I use half breast and half thigh meat (IMO meat stays moister than if using all breast).

Put this in the crockpot for 10 hours on low and it's pretty good. I took the breasts out and shredded them up w a hand mixer! Gonna throw a bit of bbq sauce on them and put some on bread, with a side of chips! A bit dry, but nothing a bit of bbq sauce on top won't fix! Nice recipe!

This was excellent!  I followed some other reviewers suggestions and added a squirt of liquid smoke,  1 tsp of minced garlic and and 1/2 tsp onion power to the mix, using Sweet Baby Rays BBQ Sauce.  After pouring the mix over the chicken, I refrigerated the chicken for 4 hours.  I didn't use all the sauce and saved some for a future dinner. Then I cooked the chicken in a slow cooker on high for 3 hrs and then on low for an hour.   I cooked 4 jumbo chicken wings, and a chicken breast.  I didn't shred it, but it was falling off the bone.   I served it over rice and loved it.

I cook mine with root beer and don't put this off until after I shred it and let it cook for another half an hour or so with the sauce in it that way that you can or even with pork will stay moist and the sauce won't burn

Not our favorite. Flavor was a little off. Maybe the bbq sauce that we used. I definitely think a sauce with plenty of smoke flavor would be best in this recipe.

I enjoyed this recipe.  It was a sweeter bbq taste. I made a few changes, I added a pinch of kosher salt, a tablespoon of minced garlic, a teaspoon of minced onions, garlic powder, natures seasoning, and a pinch of cayenne pepper. It was great! I shredded the chicken and served it on rolls.

I absolutely loved this! For the Italian dressing I used Olive Garden dressing, and I made homemade barbecue sauce. Instead of a slow cooker I put it in the Power Pressure Cooker XL on 70 lbs of pressure for 25 minutes. Turned out great. I definitely plan to make this again. One caution - I paired the meat with sweet Cole slaw and baked beans, and the whole meal turned out to be a bit too sweet. Next time I will opt for a tangier slaw or a potato salad.

I made this for dinner and we thought it was too sweet with the bbq sauce and the brown sugar. We will make it again but will decrease the amount of brown sugar for a 4 person serving. Other than that it was good.

Used 2 types of BBQ - omitted the Worcester sauce I didn't have any and used only a little Italian dressing.  Added a big dash of liquid smoke.  Made in a 16oz glass and used maybe 12oz over the raw chicken.  Cooked covered and on low for 6 hrs.  When I came back to check on it it was super liquidy which was fine.  I drained the sauce, cooked it down in a sauce pan in 3-4 mins as I was pulling apart chicken.  Re-introduced reduction and added remainder of 4oz sauce I had from before.  This is a 10/10.  The other great pulled chicken recipes are buffalo or salsa taco style pulled.

YUM!I made exactly as written except I used fresh chicken breasts, not frozen. Watch the crock pot, I did them on low for less than 4 hours and they were done. Super tender and the flavor is great. Easy to make and delicious. Thanks!

The type of BBQ Sauce make all the difference in the world. It is what makes the flavor of the whole dinner. I added half an white onion and 1 garlic clove to the dish. I put the BBQ chicken on garlic rolls. I will make this dish a main staple in my house

I love this idea. The instructions, however, need a bit of tweaking. I used fresh (not frozen) chicken breasts. I cut them once length wise to help them cook a little more thoroughly (and quickly). You can use as much or as little chicken as you think you'll need. I usually use more and use the leftovers later.

I used Stubb's Sweet and Sticky BBQ Sauce, a zesty italian dressing (Kraft).

I added all of the ingredients together in a bowl and poured it over the chicken in the crock pot.
I cooked the chicken on high for about 3 hours (stirring it every hour or so, if possible). I checked the internal temp of the chicken to help monitor its progress.
When the chicken was cooked (just about the 3 hour mark), I removed the chicken and shredded it with a couple of forks.
I added the chicken back into the crock pot and stirred it up. 
Changed the heat to medium (or keep warm).
You can add flour to the mix if its a little runny.

Serve the chicken on toasted kaiser rolls with cheese and lettuce and a side of steak fries.

Using the leftover chicken mix as a BBQ chicken topper.

Made it as shown -- way too sweet for our tastes --I'll try it again without the brown sugar. I had to add a can of beer and a tablespoon of vinegar and cooked it down on the stove to get rid of extra liquid. It was Ok, not the best I've ever had. Didn't see the point of the italian dressing.

This has become one of my family's favorite week night dinners.  It is super easy and everyone loves it! We change the flavor by using different Sweet Baby Rays sauces.  Try it! You'll love it!

EXCELLENT and oh-so-easy!  Sweet Baby Ray's is a nice choice.  I doubled the sauce.  It was a great change from pork BBQ.  
Try it ... You'll like it.    :-).   Note:  I shredded the chicken after 5 hours and continued to cook for another hour.   6 hours is plenty re cooking time.

I've made this many times and my kids always ask for more! I've tried different BBQ sauces (whatever I have on hand) Kraft, Diana, but I think sweet baby rays is the best so far. Turns out great every time!

The only things I did different was I added 6 garlic cloves and I used already defrosted chicken that I cooked on high for 4 hours.
I feel like it could have had more flavor.

This was great!  I plan to make it at the lake house this summer when I have lots of company.  I can throw the chicken in the slow cooker, enjoy the day on the lake with friends and family and still be able to serve them a delicious dinner!

Followed the recipe and was skeptical about cooking it for 4 hours on high in my slow cooker (was afraid it would dry out), but the chicken was tender and delicious! One of my picky preschoolers even ate it. My husband and I really liked it. The sauce was more watery than I would have liked and made the hamburger buns on which I served it a little soggy. Maybe toast the buns first? I'll also check out some of these other reviews to see if anyone else has a solution to that problem.

This is requested often for parties/camping. I cook the chicken (frozen-but thawed overnight in fridge) in the slow cooker with onion and chicken broth on high 4hours. I then drain/shred and return to the slow cooker on low with the bbq mix (I always use sweet baby rays) while I get ready for the party (usually at least 30 mins-sometimes a few hours). My kids cheer when they discover I'm making it! So easy.

Thanks to reviews, I made sure to use good quality bbq sauce.  Yes, the sauce was thin while cooking but I think that is because of the amount of saline that groceries inject into the chicken, so there is no way around all that extra  liquid cooking out into the sauce.  I also used the tip from others to shred the meat and cook it for a bit in the sauce and I think  this improved the flavor quite a bit.

I make this regularly. Stretches the meat budget and sweet flavor is enjoyed by my kids. Different BBQ sauce changes it completely (hickory makes a good smoky variety). Great filling for potato skins or wraps! I've even had it on bow tie pasta.

EASY FINE. We thought this was fine. My husband loves things
over baked potatoes. I made totally as directed. I read the comments about bland. I decided all these strong flavours would be fine with me. For  some reason it is bland ....I like everything about this recipe for certain occasions, but I am going to work on punching this up a bit next time.   Left overs. This was great. I drizzled a small layer  medium salsa sauce over bottom of 9/11 dish rolled a good bit of meat in tortilla and placed in dish spread rest of salsa over top. Top with cheese bake . Add salad. So good, so easy. May add peas or something next time.
Will definitely be making this again. Easy to make, great to have on hand. 2nd time. This has become a 5 for us. Who knew? This time I added red pepper flakes. Perfect. Be careful though,  it gets hotter as time goes on.

Love this recipe ! I use six chicken breasts and two of the big bottles of Sweet Baby Rays. I layer the bottom of the crock pot with one bottle, put the chicken in. I then cover the chicken in the other bottle of bbq sauce. Lastly I add the rest of the ingredients.  Always cook on high and I don't have to pull the chick apart because it just falls apart on its own.

Delicious. I used Sweet Rays BBQ sauce. Follwed the video instructions and shredded the chicken half way through the cooking time. It was tender and full of flavor. 
Made coleslaw and ate it as a sandwich.

Absolutely love this recipe!  It was my first time making it AND my first time using a slow cooker, so I decided to stick to the recipe completely. It turned out amazing! Cooked it on high for 4 hours, shredded the chicken, and cooked it low for another hour. The chicken was very tender and saucy. My 1,5 year old son loved it as well! I'll definitely be making this someday soon :D

This was an AMAZING hit at work, I am normally the first in so I threw it in the crockpot at my desk and by pot luck time everyone was ready to dive into it! Thank you SOO much for an amazing recipe. I'm going to try this on pork now as the sauce was absolutely delish!

I marinated the chicken in zesty Italian salad dressing, before cooking it in the slow cooker.

Shredded the chicken and let it soak up the sauce about an hour before we ate it.  Delicious!

I followed the directions exactly but ended up with burned and dried out chicken.  It took me forever to clean my crock pot.  Unfortunately I don't think I will make this again.

My family loves this recipe...I have made it about 4-5 times.  I am going to make a recipe and a half because they love leftovers.  I took a few suggestions from previous reviews.  I cook the exact recipe for 3 hours on high, then shred the chicken and continue cooking for another hour on low.  We toast lightly a roll with a bit of olive oil.......delicious !

I was very disappointed with how watery the sauce turned out. I think I will keep making BBQ chicken my way - slow cooking chicken, draining it and shedding it,  THEN adding the sauce. The sauce was very tasty though before I added it on top of the chicken!

My daughter has severe food allergies so I can't used bottled dressings or sauce.  I used the Bourbon Whiskey BBQ sauce and Italian dressing recipe from this site in order to make this recipe and it turned out delicious. Because the BBQ sauce already has brown sugar I omitted it from this recipe, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly and everyone from my 10 year old to my husband loved it.

Super pleasing to the entire family, including 2 picky eaters. I added a can of cream of chicken and a sleeve of crushed crackers to thicken it up. I also, added fresh garlic and my favorite go to seasonings.

I used two chicken breasts, added half of the portions of the other ingredients, cooked it in high for 3 hours then low for 1 hour after shredding them and mixing them back into the sauce.  I added more sweet baby rays after shredding as it seemed a bit bland. I'm sure that's because of dividing the portions.

Our family enjoyed this recipe very much! We served it once in sandwich form and once in a baked potato with different toppings (cheese, green onion, jalepenos, sour cream). The only changes we made to the recipe was cutting the brown sugar from 1/4 C to 1/8 C and adding a cap full of vinegar and a few dashes of hot sauce. We are intending to use this recipe on a church mission trip to feed about 25 people.

This is the easiest meal to make.  I got off work late and overcooked it by 2 hours and it was still awesome.  My normally finicky 14 year-old won't stop taking about how much she likes it.  She has said (even a week afterward) she'd be happy to have only it every day.
Making this for the 2nd time today.

I think it was the Italian dressing that tamped down the flavor of this dish.  I won't be making it again, at least not as directed.

Very tasty. I only used 4 breasts so that I wouldn't have a ton of leftovers. I used sweet baby rays BBQ sauce and ken's Italian dressing. Are it on buns with coleslaw and some shredded mozzarella.

The most phenomenal slow cooker recipe I've ever tried. I used Imo's Italian salad dressing, which is a Missouri specialty, along with a hickory honey bbq sauce. Don't go cheap with your ingredients and you'll be rewarded. Cooked for five hours on high and it was cooked perfectly. Shredded my chicken, then put it back on low for fifteen minutes to soak of the sauce before serving it on a toasted potato bread bun. It's tangy, spicy, sweet, tender... I can't recommend this recipe enough. For one person it's enough for probably eight meals if not more, and I've been eating it pretty much breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I want to cry tears of joy every time I take a bite- it's THAT good.

Hubby loves this. It's become my go to recipe when I forget to thaw something for dinner; love the fact that I can toss the breasts in still frozen! I've tried different bbq sauce, but Sweet Baby Ray's Vidalia is the best.

I was pleasantly surprised at how this turned out. I adjusted the serving size to two and followed the proportions. I agree with the reviewers that the quality of the barbecue sauce and the Italian dressing makes a huge difference. I added sautéed onions, garlic, and red chili powder. I didn't have Worcestershire sauce and I didn't miss it. Another thing- you have to know your slow cooker. Mine was done in two hours and it was not watery at all. I'll definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Made this for my family everyone loved the sauce. I used 4 whole chicken breasts not frozen.  Did not add any extra sauce. It was a little extra saucy at the end but was good since we ate it on rolls. Will definitely be making this again.

Followed directions and enjoyed it.  I cooked in broth and then at then drained, shredded and then reheated with sauce.  Sauce burns quickly so just watch or add a little water.

This is a favorite! I threw in half of a minced red onion and a tablespoon of minced garlic. I didn't use frozen chicken breasts and cooked on low for about 7 hours.

This is a great recipe for chicken BBQ.  I just use a little less brown sugar, and I use Sweet Baby Ray's original for the sauce. I used Zesty Italian Dressing, which is what this recipe is named for and other versions of the recipe call for. The dressing really makes this better than other crock pot recipes I've tried. I don't use frozen breasts, and I find the perfect time for my slow cooker is 1 hour on high and then 3 hours on low. The leftovers are great in a quesadilla or put over a baked potato.

Love it! I have made this several times and it's a hit. I defrost my chicken before putting it in the slow cooker and adjust the cooking time accordingly.  Easy, cheap, and delicious.

This was a great foundation. Love the idea. I used all of the ingredients and added a few more. I used Stubbs Hickory Bourbon sauce, used a package of dry Italian seasoning instead of the dressing,  added 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar, tbls. Smoked paprika, half bottle of stout beer. Cooked 6 hours on low. Shredded the chicken in the pot in the sauce and let it cook another hour so the chicken absorbed up much of the sauce. By the time it was done, almost all the sauce was gone but just enough that it was nice and moist and juicy. Next time, I'm going to do my chipotle chicken wraps this way. Delicious and effortless!

I used three large frozen chicken breasts, and for the sauce I used Stubb's Spicy BBQ sauce and subbed 1/4 cup balsamic dressing for the 1/2 cup  Italian dressing (because that is all I had on hand).

This turned out amazing! Cooked if for 4 hours on high, then shredded the chicken and cooked for another hour on low. The spicy BBQ sauce really made it great. We had the chicken on hoagie rolls and my boyfriend said it was his favorite meal I've made in a long time (and he is a picky eater). Will be making this again!

This was super easy and sooooooo good! I washed, trimmed, and seasoned my frozen chicken breast with garlic powder and cajun seasoning. I used Sweet Baby Ray's Sweet & Spicy Bbq sauce, Olive Garden Italian dressing, Lea & Perrins Worcestershire sauce, and only 1/3 cup of brown sugar (since the bbq sauce is already sweet). I added chopped onions, lemon juice from half a lemon, and 2 teaspoons of Liquid Smoke to the sauce before pouring it over the chicken. I cooked it on high for 3hrs, removed the chicken to shred, and returned it to the pot. I cooked it for 1hr more after that. Served it on a toasted jumbo bun. It was absolutely delicious!!! I will definitely kerp this recipe in rotation.

I made this dish a couple of times and finally got it tweaked to where we all love it. I use fresh or thawed chicken cutlets.    I added half of a sliced onion at the bottom of the slow cooker before I placed the chicken on top.  In addition, I added a tsp of liquid smoke and cut the sugar to 1 tbs instead of the 1/4 cup.  My family found that the 1/4 cup brown sugar made it a little too sweet.  I used Dinosaur bbq sauce and it was delicious.  I also followed some of the other reviews and only cooked it for 3 hours on high, shredded the chicken and added it back to the pot and then cooked it for another half hour on high.

I made this using a recommendation of another reviewer.  First I used a combination of chicken breasts (1lb) and boneless thighs (3lb). I cooked it for 3 hours on high with 12 oz of chicken broth and a sprinkle of garlic powder on the chicken.  I drained almost all of the chicken broth.  Then I added the rest of the ingredients and cooked on low for another hour.

Followed the recipe and slow cooked it on high for 4 hours, came out great, will try next time and do it on low as the chicken was a tad dry but luckily the sauce was plentiful and mixed it well to offset this condition. Great recipe.

Luvs2seeUeat Review: Did not have Italian dressing--oops! I did not choose to go back to the grocery store either. So instead of Italian Dressing, I added a little dried onion soup mix, [about 3 tsp], and 1/4 cup of low salt chicken broth, and a tsp of garlic paste to all of the other ingredients and mixed the ingredients together; tossed it on the marinaded boneless chicken in the slower cooker [with a liner of course] and cooked it  for 3 and a half hours on high. After shredding the chicken, I added a tad more chicken broth and Kraft Honey Barbecue sauce, mixed it together and left the chicken in the slow cooker on low for 20 minutes and turned it to warm and everyone spooned the chicken on fresh rolls right from the slow cooker [to avoid a lot of clean-up]. Along with a spinach salad, this was an easy and delicious dinner!

Great meal! I followed the directions from the recipe and took some advice from other reviewers. I used 6 fresh chicken breasts and Olive Garden Italian dressing and Sweet Baby Ray's Honey Barbeque (this may have made the meal a little too sweet, so I'll go with a spicier bbq sauce next time or add hot sauce). 

I added diced onions and cooked for 3 hours on high,  shredded the chicken, added some flour to the juice, put the chicken back in, and cooked on low for 30 minutes. The chicken was perfectly done. We ate the chicken on sandwiches with dill pickle chips and blue cheese on the side. Pickles are a must! It was really good! 

To make it even better, I will do something to lighten the sweetness a bit next time. That could mean adding less flour, watering the juice down a little bit, and  adding the onions later. I could also try using less sugar or a different (maybe spicier) barbeque sauce. I will also get some cole slaw for the side.

Pretty good. Found this to be better the next day with added barbecue sauce.  Put on buns with sport peppers and mozzarella cheese - baked in the oven til cheese melted.

Made this for dinner tonight. Followed  the directions  but only used 3 chicken breasts so  only used half a bottle of barbecue sauce. I used Sweet Baby Rays it was yummy. I shredded  the chicken after about 5 hours of cooking it on high then added a little more sauce and cooked it on low for another hour.

I've made this a few times and it's a hit every time! It's great on a bun or with rice. I followed the recipe to a T. I love the simplicity of using a slow cooker! I cook it on high for about 3.5 hours. I'll usually start breaking it up after 3 hours. I plan to make this for Christmas Eve this year. If I have enough time, i'll try it on low for 6-8 hours.

It is imperative that you don't use the chicken that comes individually frozen (in a bag from the grocery store freezer section). The first time I made this, I used the chicken that was frozen in the cellophane wrap and it was perfect! The second time I used the bag o chicken and it was watery, thin and tasteless.

I've made this twice and the second time I slightly edited the recipe. I used Sweet Baby Ray's Tangy BBQ sauce, Zesty Italian Dressing, and backed off on the brown sugar slightly. I cooked on low and about an hour before serving, shredded the chicken. This allowed the sauce to thicken up. This was a simple and really good recipe.

I used frozen chicken breasts and increased heat to high after six hours. After shredding the chicken, it soaked up the bbq sauce (Sweet Baby Rays) and I added more. Delicious on a kaiser roll grilled with a little oil and garlic salt as another commenter suggested. Served with colby jack cheese and sliced red onion. Delish! Will definately make again.

This recipe was a hit at my house. I cooked the chicken breasts (from frozen) for 4 hours, then pulled them apart with two forks and cooked it for another hour in the juices. I didn't have Italian dressing so I looked up an easy recipe to make my own with olive oil and spices (e.g., oregano, basil, etc.) Also FTR I used Bull's Eye Original BBQ sauce. I'll probably halve the sugar next time since I found it a bit on the sweet side, but I will definitely make it again! We had it with mashed potatoes and roasted broccoli but I can totally see this being good in a bun too.

I cooked on high for 3 1/2 hours and the chicken was so tender with a wonderful flavor! My daughter who is a very picky eater and normally doesn't like barbeque LOVED it!!!  She calls it amazing chicken- a definite keeper!

Good, not amazing.  May try again some day with a different bbq sauce.  Used Sweet Baby Ray's original.  It was good, but a little sweet.

I have made this 3 times now. First time, I forgot to half the chicken so it was good but it was more like BBQ chicken and didn't pull apart to go on a sandwich. Which was fine, we just made some mac and cheese and baked beans..problem solved. The 2nd time we remembered to half the chicken and it was a disaster..followed the time directions exactly but came home to burnt overcooked chicken and sauce. So the third followed the directions exactly again but this time stuck around so that it could be monitored and stopped cooking at the appropriate time. That time it turned out very good but still working on trying to fine tune it because we can't always be here to monitor dinner all day.

So far the best recipe for chicken breasts that I've found.   After reading others' reviews, I decided on Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.  Only had 3 chicken breasts (large) so added flour to thicken the sauce.  Yummy sandwich :-)

Followed the recipe exactly, used honey garlic bbq sauce. Turned out fantastic, though we prefer to eat it as-is, rather than on a bun.

Perfect! I followed the recipe (fresh instead of frozen for 6hrs), using Montgomery Inn bbq sauce & Newman's Own Italian dressing. With 7 people in the house it is really difficult to please everyone (especially the picky 10yo). We used slider buns and some of the kids added more bbq sauce to their sandwiches but it was perfect without. The older kids even asked to take it to lunch the next day. This is so simple and the perfect dish for a party or if your stuck on what to make for dinner.

This was good. It was the first time I have ever used a slow cooker. 

As per some of the other mentions, I added some diced onions and a dash of liquid smoke to the mix. I made my own Italian dressing that I found on food.com (it's not a dressing normally in our home). 

I have a Breville "fast slow cooker" and since it doesn't have a high setting (ironic given the name but it's for the pressure cooker aspect), I had it on for 6 hours, shredded the chicken and then used the sear setting to reduce some of the liquid. 

I'm looking forward to using the leftovers!

I love this recipe! It is just so darn good. I get my slow cooker started in the morning, and by supper time I have a batch of tender, juicy BBQ chicken ready to go! It's great on a toasted bun with a side of coleslaw.

I use this recipe frequently for my family. We love the zesty tang that the Italian dressing gives it.  I always try to allow sufficient time to cook on low (whether using frozen or fresh chicken), just because chicken comes out more tender on low same as every other crockpot recipe I've ever tried.  We usually eat the chicken smothered with a piece of melted cheese, all on a bun.  We eat with a fork because it's messy but oh so good!

super easy and delicious. only change was to omit the brown sugar -- it was definitely plenty sweet, and the sugar would've been overkill. paired with a jalapeno and apple slaw, this chicken made a killer sandwich

Delicious! I did as the previous poster described. I used three de thawed chicken breasts and cooked on high for three hours. Then shredded the meat and cooked an extra 30-40 minutes. The chicken didn't need to be cooked any more so I was worried I'd over cook it after shredding it but the extra 35 minutes cooed on high, helped cook off some vinegar taste the sauce had had as well as absorb some of the watery juices in the sauce.

This was really really good but just a little sweet to me.  But I think that's how it's supposed to be or maybe because I used Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce w/ honey.  Next time I will skip or cut back on the brown sugar.  I will still use the Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce, it's a good brand. I followed everything else except I used regular chicken breast that was not frozen, I added 1/2 cup chopped onion, 1 teaspoon of garlic powder, 2 - 3 teaspoons vinegar and 2 teaspoons of liquid smoke.  I topped my sandwich with some cole slaw I made, it was good!  Thank you!

Fantastic! I did take the advice of cooking the chicken all day in the crock pot with some chicken broth and spices. Then shredded, dumped the broth, returned to the crock pot and added the BBQ mixture. So good on a roll with cole slaw. Can't wait to make it into a BBQ salad tomorrow! Thanks for a great recipe.

I have made this recipe twice. First time I followed the recipe exactly and found it a bit sweet and watery. second attempt I used fresh chicken and it was way better and not so eater logged. I also used half the amount of sugar and my family liked it way more.

Fantastic! I used sweet baby rays (it's our all time favorite) I added about 1/2 tsp chili powder and a sprinkle to chipoltle chicken seasoning to kick it up. Cooked on high for 3 hours (my chicken was half thawed) then low for 2 hours. after shredding the chicken it really soaked up the sauce. Made this for a herd of hungry guys and the gave rave reviews. my first ever attempt at a real bbq and turned out great! Only addition I would make next time would be to add some onion.

A go to recipe.  I use Sweet Baby Rays  bbq sauce.  I usually only do 4 breasts but keep all other  ingredients the same.  I've done it both on HIGH and LOW with great success.  Doubled it for a family reunion and everyone wanted the recipe.

So good and so easy! I did allow the chicken thighs to thaw a little and then cut off most of the fat. I used Wishbone Italian salad dressing and a cheap bottle of BBQ store (Kraft, I believe), and this was still amazing served over rolls.

My family loved this, and it was so easy. I used Kirkland chicken (fresh, not frozen) from Costco and Stubbs Original BBQ sauce. I added 1 tsp. of liquid smoke. I cooked it on low for 2 hours, then 1 hour on high setting, then used fork to shred chicken, then cooked 40 more minutes on low.

This is rather good for how simple it is.  I used about 2 pounds of non frozen chicken breasts (3 good size ones).  I cut the brown sugar in half.  I cooked for 3 hours on low, shredded the chicken and then cooked for an hour on high.

This is a great recipe!!  It is important to use a decent BBQ sauce, so use your favorite kind. The only 2 changes I make: 1) I use a mixture of chicken thighs and breasts about 8- 10 pieces (skinless), once the meat cooks in the sauce I remove any fat and bones while shredding the fully cooked meat then I dump out the cooked, watery sauce then 2) I make a fresh round of the sauce mixture and replace the shredded meat in the crock pot on warm or low setting for an hour with the new sauce mix.  This turns up the flavor and makes it extra moist! Love this recipe

We loved this recipe, however I skipped the sugar and it was still very flavorful.  Also, I followed the suggestion to add chopped onion and garlic. We served it on buns with a little melted Asiago cheese and some slice avocado. We think this will be a regular family recipe. Of course, you have to use the BBQ sauce that you like. We prefer it less sweet, and we love Annie's Original BBQ sauce.

I agree that the cooking time & temperature is incorrect.  After 2 hours on high, the sauce began to burn.  It ending up cooking 2 hours on high & 2 hours on low.  I used KC Masterpiece Original BBQ Sauce & Kraft Italian dressing.  I also used fresh chicken breasts.  There is no need to shred the chicken.  Stir with a fork every now and then & the chicken will pull apart on its own.  Great tasting & easy recipe.

Made this this week.  My wife is a very picky eater but she thought this was excellent.  It was really good. I think it would be equally good with pork or beef,,,,,oh and let's not forget our wonderful little smokies.

I did add garlic cloves and onion. I used Bob Evans bbq sauce. Based on reviews, I will try it with Sweet Baby Rays next time and see if that's an improvement. We'll be having chicken left-overs tonight over salad greens and finely shredded cheddar.

Very easy quick dinner.  I cooked it on high for about 3 hours using fresh(not frozen) boneless skinless chicken breasts and thighs.  Shredded it and then let it cook for about 30 minutes.

I didn't have italian salad dressing on hand, so I made some italian dressing mix up and put a little in together with a dash of olive oil and a dash or two of vinegar. 

An hour before I served it was a little watery so I shredded the chicken, mixed in a little cornstarch and left the lid off.  

My meat eating family loved it. I think we'll use the leftovers for a bbq chicken pizza tomorrow night!

I would make this again but would omit the brown sugar as a couple people said it was too sweet. I used Sweet Baby Rays original bbq sauce and Chipotle 50/50 which added a little zip.  Also added one small onion.

When it still has a half an hour or so, after you shred the chicken, I add a bag of shredded carrots. It goes a lot further and the kids get some veggies! I tried it once with pork it was ok but the chicken is much better.

I love this recipe. I always turn it into pulled chicken. It soaks up all the sauce that way. I actually used this for my baby shower. Everyone that tried it loved it. :-)

I used four chicken breasts and that was pushing it. This recipe was just ok for me.

This is a delicious recipe. The sauce was watery but I removed the chicken for shredding, whisk flour into the sauce to thicken, replaced chicken and mixed together. Served on a toasted bun with sliced tomato. My family enjoyed it. It was great!

My family loves this recipe!  Some of our family members have celiac disease, so I serve this over baked potatoes with grated cheddar cheese.  The recipe is very versatile and easy.  After the chicken is done, I always shred it and put it back into the sauce to cook for another 30-45 minutes.

I will make this again and again. I followed "Cooking 101's" helpful tips(the most helpful positive review on this page). The only things I did differently is 1) I didn't have worcestershire sauce and 2)Ii used hamburger rolls with garlic rubbed and butter under oven broiler to toast. I also topped with sour pickle slices.

Easy, turned out well after I did a little customization. I used more bbq sauce. I didn't use the sugar. I added some liquid and chicken bouillon during the initial cooking, then drained it, shredded it easily, and put in refrigerator til next day. When I reheated it, I added more bbq sauce. I served sliced pickles with it.

This is my go-to bbq chicken recipe and everyone raves about it. I make mine almost exactly following the recipe, but add 1 small chopped onion, as others have suggested. It does depend on the bbq sauce you use on whether it's sweet, tangy, or spicy. I've makes it with many types and I think most people tend to love it the most with honey BBQ sauce. I've also played around with adding honey in addition to the brown sugar and I don't think it changed it much. I put it in the crock pot for 3 hours on high, then pull the chicken with 2 forks, and then let it sit in the crock pot and soak up the sauce for another hour. You and your guest will love it!

Too sweet! I used Sweet Baby Ray's Original BBQ sauce. I followed recipe's measurements exactly for the BBQ sauce, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, and Italian dressing. I did add a few splashes of liquid smoke and liquid garlic (neither of which should have adversely affected the sweetness or flavor).  Next time, I won't bother with the brown sugar or just put 1/4 of the recipe's measurement. Yes, it was that sweet. Also, I didn't care for the tang of the Italian dressing. I'll omit that next time.  I slow cooked on high for 4 hours lid on, shredded the chicken with a fork, then 1 hour on high lid off.  The chicken was juicy and tender. I served slider-style on dinner rolls.

Love this recipe! It was so easy to put together and came out great! Lots of flavor and the chicken was very tender. I followed this recipe as it's written, only add about a 1/2 of chopped onion and 3 cloves of garlic. I used fresh chicken, not frozen... and cooked it 5 hours on low, took it out and shredded the chicken, then put it back for another hour. I'll definitely be making this again, it's a family favorite in my household!

I have made this recipe like 6 times since I found it.  It is super easy, I throw it on salads too.  I entered a cooking contest and won 2nd place with it.  I have not altered the recipe at all and it is wonderful as is.  I use Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce but use what ever you like.  I am going to try it with pork too.  Great to have for a dinner with friends too!

I made it for a weekend meal and followed Cooking101's suggestions.the only thing that I did differently from Cooking101 is that I used my family's favorite BBQ sauce, Sweet Baby Rays. I have to say that generally I don't really like BBQ meals, however...I LOVED this one. Also our family of six rarely ever agrees on meals, but everyone loved this one. Thank- you!

Super duper recipe!

I used Heinz Hickory BBQ and followed the recipe to a T (but the Heinz BBQ is 18 oz... nice and thick!) This recipe was AWESOME! Definitely doing it again and again until it is stuck in my memory!

Good and easy.  Followed recipe exactly and cooked for 8 hours on low.  Tasted a little overcooked, 6 hours probably would have been better.  After shredding put chicken back in crock pot on warm for 30 minutes.  Everyone had seconds:)

This is very versatile. I used a half bottle of prepared dressing, not dry. I used a family size can of soup, and I used a quarter cup of cream cheese. I also added a cube of vegetable bouillon. It came out pretty rich and thick, but that was how I liked it. This tasted great with steak instead of chicken, as well.

For someone who is not a "pulled pork" fan, I really didn't think I'd care much for the "pulled chicken"... But OMG this was great!  I am not much of a cook, I do some online recipes here and there, but this was definitely one I will make again.  My husband loved this recipe!  Looking at some of the reviews I was worried it would be a bit watery... But once I shredded the chicken after I cooked it for 3 hours on high in my slow cooker, the sauce thickened up and it was just perfect!  FOLLOW the recipe timing!  3 Hours on High, shred chicken add back to slow cooker, 1 hour on low!  Great Recipe!!!!

I tried it last night and it was a hit in our household.  I cooked it on low for 8 hours then moved it to warm for 2 hours until dinner.  I served it with a baked potato and salad and everyone was full.  In the future, I will definitely prepare this in bags ahead of time and keep in the freezer.

I made this for the salad club at work and all I can say is OH MY GOSH!!!  Now instead of paying my weekly dues, I have to fix this BBQ.  Lol.  I also used it for regular BBQ baked chicken and I think I like that even better. Whoever put this recipe together need to be given a gold!!!  Just awesome!!!

Mine turned out very soupy with very little flavor. To salvage it, I took the chicken out, dumped the 'juice' that was in the crock, put the chicken back in and added another bottle of BBQ sauce (I use Stubbs Spicy - don't care for the sweeter sauces).

Honestly, slow cookers (crock pots) are the Best thing to cook in. You can just throw things in the pot the morning of and turn on high, before you know it you come home from school and the whole house just smells divine.  I’ve never personally had chicken barbeque in a crockpot but this recipe, I’m Definitely Trying! I love chicken and I love barbeque so this is a MUST. The ingredients needed for this recipe are simple and easy, but I don’t know about the Italian dressing. I don’t know well it will taste if I incorporate it in this recipe. The picture looks so delectable and I am seriously about to make this recipe when I am done writing this review. I plan to make it for my roommates and myself. But since there is little ingredients, it should be fairly simple. I will be sure to update how it goes! But 4 stars for simplicity!

I used name brands....Jack Daniels BBQ sauce, Perdue chicken, Hidden Valley dressing. I don't know what went wrong but there was 0 flavor. I cooked it for 3 hours, took it out and shredded it, cooked for another 1-2 hours. Very soupy and just no flavor.

I have tried this recipe using Masterpiece BBQ sauce with both Olive Garden and Girard's Italian dressings and this is the best BBQ sauce I've ever tasted! I've used it on chicken and pork ribs both in the crockpot. YUMMY!!!

Wasn't a big fan of this one. Maybe I simply wasn't in the mood. Looked good. Smelled good but didn't do it for me. Made a ton. You definitely need to love meat for this one. Still think it might be good for quesadillas but will not be making again.

My husband dislike anything chicken BUT, he loved this recipe, so it's a keeper.  I use a good BBQ sauce and a bit of liquid smoke - keep watch on it so the sauce doesn't burn.

I made it and thought it was delicious. It was neither, watery, dry, vinegary, burnt, etc. I followed the recipe exactly except added two bay leaves, a few dashes of Tabasco and some red pepper flakes (I like some heat to BBQ), I used frozen chicken breasts and Famous Dave's sauce. People with poor reviews must be using poor ingredients.I cooked it on high for four hours and it was perfect. It was sweet, tangy and had a kick. It was also perfectly shredded and moist. Will definitely make again.

Amazing! I used almost 2.5 lbs of chicken which made about 16 sandwiches, for 6 people, and there were no leftovers!!!! I used Italian marinade sauce instead of Italian dressing. And I also added onion. And I topped the sandwiches with coleslaw--so good!

At first I was unsure about making this because a lot of people made different suggestions or alterations to the original recipe. I did make this but I used 3 chicken breast and kept everything else the same but I did not put frozen chicken breast in my slow cooker. I really loved the flavor, it was tangy and yummy. I served this on buns and had sides of green beans and mac & cheese. I will definitely make this again using my alterations.

This is such an easy recipe.  I use homemade Italian dressing,  "Italian Dressing Mix" from this site.  I always have a big batch of the dry mix ready, so whipping some Italian dressing takes 2 minutes.  I use about a cup of dressing so the chicken has a good amount of sauce.  When I don't have all day to let the chicken cook, I cut the breasts horizontally and set my crock pot to high, and it cooks in about 2 hours.  My husband likes it best as a sandwich, but the kids and I like it best over rice.  My family LOVES this recipe.  And I LOVE how totally easy it is.

I made this for my partner and he LOVED it so much he asked for it again the same week. I looked at other reviews and I cooked on high for 3 hours then shred the chicken and cooked on low for another 1 hour. It turned out PERFECT. I used Cattle Jacks original BBQ sauce for the recipe and it was the perfect BBQ sauce. I will keep making this.

Omg this is delicious. Made this today and it will be one of my favorite meals.  Follow the recipe. The only thing I changed was the Worcestershire sauce (cause I didn't have any) for soy sauce instead. Everyone loved it!!

This was delicious!! I am terrible at BBQ. My picky kids don't like it, they almost didn't even taste it, then they gobbled it up!!!  so happy to find it, thank you for sharing this great recipe. at first I tasted the italian dressing ( i used wishbone) so I added about another half cup of BBQ sauce.(famous Daves) Minimal ingredients, maximum flavor! It's nice to know you can throw in frozen breast, too. So buy bulk and freeze! Awesome either way as I had thawed breasts.

Great and easy recipe! It's pretty hard to go wrong with this one. The only trouble I had with it was that the sauce came out watery (maybe because I used frozen chicken things instead of breasts?), so I added some cornstarch and that thickened it.

Phenomenal food!  Used a modified recipe: didn't add dressing, used BBQ sauce with the other ingredients (KC), added cooked julienned (1" long) white onions after 4 hours & cooked it in crock pot for a total of 6 hours on Low.  Toasted kaiser rolls brushed with extra virgin olive oil & garlic powder.  Added muenster cheese to the sandwiches, served open or closed face, which made it heavenly!  The only downside was smelling this cooking for 6 hours. :). Mmmmm!!

This was a staple in our house until I overdid it...now I can only break it out once every other month or so. It's THAT EASY and always delicious...and so much healthier than pulled pork, which we love. EASY EASY!

I liked it a lot, but not only did I have a lot of leftovers... I ended up having to throw it away! I'll look for other bbq sauces to tweak this with, I'm sure my husband will come around.

This recipe is fabulous! The Italian dressing and BBQ sauce (I used KC Masterpiece) sounds strange but believe me, this is one good sauce! I cooked mine on low for 6 hours and it was actually just a tad over cooked but it didn't matter. My son and I wolfed these down in a hurry!  If you want an unbelievable chicken BBQ, look no further!

I have a family of all boys and they couldn't get enough!! they ate the leftovers for 3 days! I made loaded nachos and put a heaping of this on top and it was a WOW!  I did add a tblsp of liquid smoke and garlic cloves for an extra kick.  I'm making it again today for SUPER BOWL SUNDAY! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

My boyfriend is extremely picky about BBQ and he LOVED this. I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce (the honey one) and added  a little liquid smoke. After I took out all the chicken and shredded it I checked the sauce before I mixed it all together and decided it needed a little more BBQ sauce to take away a slight overly vinegary taste. It was perfect. Boyfriend loved it. We use this recipe with brisket also (chop the brisket after it is done cooking) and it is always spot on.

I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce with a few cloves of garlic. I left out the Italian dressing and Worcestershire sauce because I was out of them. Cooked on high for 3 hours, shredded the chicken in the cooker, and cooked for an additional hour on low.

Very easy and used ingredients I usually have on hand- turned out very sweet (and I didn't use any brown sugar)- I added an onion and diced bell pepper- had to add 10-15 dashes hot sauce and it still tasted liked it was missing something- however, the kids loved it

I needed something fast and this was it! Glad I picked it because my picky son loved it. Leftovers taste even better. Didn't have Worcestershire sauce so just added some tapatio sauce. Used frozen breast and cooked on high for 4 hours. Shredded then cooked for another half hour. Also added some diced onions and seasoned the chicken. Everyone loved it!

Tasty, easy to make.  Sauce slightly loose, I used Wondra to thicken. Used fresh chicken breast. Didn't shred it. Mis-judged my time, so cooked last half hour in oven at 350.

This is a great recipe, although I did make some changes to lessen the sweetness, since we like things less sweet.  I used a recipe for BBQ sauce that I found on another web site (Cooking Light) posted in the community (it's called Chuck's Famous BBQ Sauce), and I made some changes to that.  My most important addition to the bbq sauce recipe is about half a bottle of McCormick Montreal Steak Sauce.  I would've added more if I'd had more.  That really made some of the best bbq sauce I've ever had.  I didn't have the called-for molasses, so I Googled substitutions, and brown sugar was recommended for things which need the flavor of molasses (3/4 c to 1 c molasses).   I also had to subst. onion powder for minced onion since I didn't have that on hand.  I used Apple Cider Vinegar for the vinegar.  Then, I noticed a bit late that the chicken recipe required Italian Salad dressing; I didn't have any of that either, so I looked up and found a fabulous dressing mix on this web site (the best!).  I mixed that up with tarragon vinegar as well as the called-for oil, water and dry mix. Really, this allrecipes web site truly does have some of the best recipes.  Yes, I know.  It takes extra time to "make your own" and I might have saved a lot of time by simply going to the nearby grocery store to buy both bbq sauce and Italian salad dressing; but, if I'd done that, I would've missed out on discovering some very good "from scratch" versions.  If you have extra time, I highly suggest it.

The first time I made this recipe I prepared it exactly as written. I found the resulting dish tasty but too sweet for my personal taste. After making this several times my changes are as follows: decrease brown sugar to 1/8 cup and increase Worcestershire sauce to 4 tablespoons. Either way, this is an excellent recipe.

DELISH! Whole family loved it. I did cook the chicken for 3 hours then drained (to avoid watery sauce).  Then added rest of ingredients. Cooked for 1 hour.  It was perfect!  Whole family loved it.  My husband was talking about it when he woke up the next morning!  Very memorable!

I tried this and it was super easy!  My kids loved it and we ate it for the next couple of days.  I did, however, use thawed chicken for this instead of frozen.  The sauce seemed a bit watery, but I cooked it a while with the lid off the crock pot and it thickened up.  My friends said that if it remained too watery that I could add corn starch, but I didn't actually have to.
Came out great and I plan to make it again!

I'm currently making this recipe for the fourth time(in three months). My husband and I LOVE it! I typically use Sweet Baby Rays barbecue sauce and it turns out great! I used a Jack Daniels sauce one time and it was very runny.

Loved this recipe! It was so easy to put together, and I added a little minced garlic which was definitely a necessary addition. I baked some crescent rolls to put the bbq chicken on and it was perfect...must do again!

Just made this and it was very tasty.  I have to say though, I found Cooking 101's review almost more helpful than the recipe itself.  I cooked for 6 hours on low with the chicken sitting in chicken broth, then I drained the broth, covered with the sauce and cooked 2 more hours on low.  It was delicious!

My family loves this recipe. I make it with Sweet Baby Ray's Original BBQ sauce, Hidden Valley Italian Salad dressing, and dark brown sugar. I substitute 1 tablespoon of either low sodium teriyaki sauce or soy sauce for the Worcestershire sauce. Next time, I think I'll try a good quality smokey BBQ sauce for a change. This tastes super good the next day either hot or cold. Yum!

I thought this recipe was sooo good! I couldn't quite find a good recipe for BBQ shredded chicken sandwiches and finally I can say I did! I changed the servings to 3 and followed all those directions (I maybe used a little more BBQ sauce and used fresh chicken), cooked on low for about 6 hours, it did seem kinda watery before shredding the chicken, but once I shredded the chicken, I left it in for maybe another hour at most and it soaked all that liquid up making the recipe perfect!! I will definitely use this recipe again, it was so easy!  With the leftovers, I plan to use those in quesadillas or a salad like many other reviewers said they did.

The chicken was incredibly tender and overall had a mild flavor...could use a little more spice to give more flavor.   Its great for kids...mild and very tender...will make it again for them.

I used Famous Dave's sauce and Olive Garden's Italian dressing. My two kids in middle school say this is one of the best things I've ever made. They prefer to eat the breasts whole. Melt in your mouth delicious!

Tried while I was cooking this and didn't quite like it so I threw in about 2 more tbs worsteshire sauce and about 1/4 c Splenda and it was wonderful, will try starting out with a different BBQ sauce.  Will be sure t make this again, oh I also used 8 chicken thighs instead of breasts.

WOW this was SUPER yummy! Made as directed and it turned out great! We shredded the chicken at about 6 hours and then put it back in for the final 2 - helped absorb the flavors.

This was pretty good.  I made exactly as written using only 5 chicken breasts because they were very large.  I had leftover bbq sauce and dressing I wanted to use up which was made this recipe perfect to try.  As others have said the sauce was a little thin and did thicken up after I shredded it.  We made open faced sandwiches and look forward to putting it over baked potatoes tomorrow.

Turned out great, although I had to make the following adjustments based on what I had on hand. For sauce I used 2 Fat Guys BBQ sauce - approx 8 oz, Trader Joe's Caesar Parmesan dressing - approx 1/4 cup, 1 tsp brown sugar. Chopped up garlic and put that on the chicken, then poured the sauce mix over it. Used 4 thawed chicken breasts, cooked on low for 1 hour, high for 3 more, shredded the chicken, added the rest of the jar of the 2 fat guys bbq sauce, and cooked 1 more hour on low. (BTW, shredding the chicken made a world of difference, it soaked up all the watery sauce and adding the extra sauce gave the perfect ratio of meat to sauce) Everyone loved it!

Followed the recipe exactly except only cooked on Low for 5.5 hours. Seems saucy, but once you shred the chicken (which I realize the recipe doesn't actually tell you to do), it's really the right amount!

This chicken does have potential, but the recipe lacks flavor as is.  I followed directions exactly as the recipe states, but the dish came out runny, so I cooked it further to reduce the liquid. Overall a good recipe, but needs other flavors to be a success (garlic, onion, peppers, herbs, etc.)

Somehow the review I left is gone so I decided to leave it again. The first time, I gave this one 4 stars but now am changing it to 5 stars after making this dish again. I used famous dave's sweet and zesty the first time and this time, I used original flavor. I think the original is better. Now mine comes out a bit soupy which disappointed me a bit at first but we actually used that soupy stuff for bbq spaghetti. Oh, boy was it good! We simply poured it over linguine, topped it with colby jack and chopped green onions(just like a restaurant in my areas serves except they serve it with pulled pork). I packed the leftover for my hubby's lunch and he said it was REALLY REALLY good even reheated. He said he had wished there were some more. So I made it again. This time, I did put one more piece of chicken(last time, I put 4 breasts and 3 tenders but this time just 5 pcs of breasts). It was not as soupy as last time but better for bbq spaghetti. I thickened the sauce a bit with starch(1 spoon of starch and 1 spoon of water- thought about doing it 2 but was afraid that it would make it too thick). I did add half an onion both times. It's just so easy to make and the result is so good. I think we'll stick to original flavor sauce from now. I thawed chicken in the water and soaked them in milk after that to get rid of chicken smell(Yes, I am quite sensitive to smell). So it adds a bit more work than called for but is definitely worth it. It goes well with tabasco, too or jalepeno.

loved this recipe! Thanks for sharing! This turned out so delicious that even my 7-year old picky eater, ate it with rice:)
I have read recommendations to add garlic and onions which I did, and used Guy Fieri Sweet Bourbon sauce and it was perfect!!!!  i also shredded the chicken after 3 hours and added another hour on low heat since I dont want my chicken to dry out. 
We have paired it with cornbread for dinner and it was match made in heaven.
Would I recommend this recipe?Heck yeah! Would this be in my Favorite Recipe files? Absolutely!!!!

Really good with rice and veggies. 
If you already want to start that dish in the morning and have it for dinner just cook the chicken in the slow cooker for 7h on low, shred it and cook it again for another hour. 
My kids and I loved it :)

This was so easy and my husband and I loved it! It makes a big batch so I am taking some to my brother and family. This will truly be a favorite. I did thaw my chicken and clean it as I never bake with frozen chicken or any other meat. It is so nice to let the slow cooker do the work while I am busy cleaning house and doing laundry.  And this freezes well too. Thanks so much for this recipe.

The sauce for this recipe is the best I've tried for pulled chicken! It's not too sweet and not too tangy--just perfect! I made a double portion of the sauce and reserved half in an empty squeeze bottle for extra yummy BBQ sauce on top of the sandwiches, and other dinners like chicken nuggets and smoked pork chops!

Many comments said too much liquid and it's true. Could use 3/4 of what it calls for and still have plenty. I took other readers suggestions to shred it and put it back in the sauce. My company really enjoyed it. If I make it again, I would add some hot sauce. Not spicy enough for me.

This recipe was a pleasant surprise! Truth be told I was looking for an alternative to pulled pork (very time consuming) and this was a hit!! 
Just a note, a good quality bbq sauce is important here. I put the leftovers into a bolognese sauce and result was a very yummy very rich sauce. Thanks!

This recipe is super easy and very yummy.   I have been experimenting with different BBQ sauces to change the taste a bit.    Also going to double the recipe and use for a party.

I shredded the chicken at the 3 hour mark and cooked it on low for 10 hours, but the last few hours I wasn't home and my crock pot burnt the sugars in the sauce. The un-burned part was delicious! My photo is pre-burning.

Not impressed. This produced way too much liquid with frozen chicken and the liquid was not very BBQ-y at the end of cooking. Even shredded it would not have soaked it up, which I was glad for because the end result sauce was not tasty to me at all. I drained it, poured another bottle of BBQ sauce on it cooked it for another 30 minutes. That was good.

This is a great recipe! I did not use the extra sugar because the bottle of sauce I used was on the sweet side. It was amazing on some soft potato rolls. My kids loved it.

This was delicious. I thawed my breasts and seared them on the grill for a couple minutes on each side then put them in the slow cooker on low and waited for them to turn into mouth watering pulled chicken barbecue. YUM!

This was just OK. I used Sweet Baby Ray's sauce for the BBQ sauce. I just expected it to be a lot "zestier". Will not make again.

This recipe is so easy to make and so good! It's a no brainer. I added onion to it and cooked it for less time than what was suggested because my slow cooker tends to cook at a higher temperature than most. It turned out fabulous!

This is really delicious and easy!  After I had put everything into the crockpot, I came back an hour later and found that my crockpot was broken.  I just transferred everything to my stock pot, and I cooked it on low on the stove for the rest of the time.  It was perfect and delicious!

We don't like sweet BBQ, so I used Rudy's "Sissy BBQ Sauce" with the Italian dressing. Added a little extra olive oil, a couple cloves of minced garlic & skipped the brown sugar.  After shredding, to me it was lacking flavor, so I opted to make a sort of texmex dish by adding some chopped green chiles, chile powder, cumin and oregano.  We served it on toasted hoagie rolls with 'Spanish slaw' (shredded cabagge tossed with Italian dressing).  I thought this was good, and my husband just raved about it.  So thanks!

This was simply delicious! Everyone who tried it raved how good it was.  The only thing I changed was the amount of brown sugar, since I have to keep my sugar intake to a minimum.  I used 1/8 cup of the Splenda Brown Sugar blend and it was just enough to balance the other ingredients.

Made this exactly as written, but I used fresh, not frozen, chicken breasts.  Slow cooked on high for just 3.5 hours , and it was delicious--and super easy!  Everyone loved it.   Thanks for posting it.

Panic! We had 10 people coming for a birthday party, and I made the zesty slow cooker chicken barbecue. I doubled the recipe; could that have caused it not to cook? Began it just before noon, on 'low.' At 3, I tried to shred it with 2 forks. No go! The chicken breasts seemed like blobs of uncooked poultry; they were still frozen. I turned the cooker up to 'high' and let another hour go by. Still nowhere near being ready to shred. Then, a few at a time, I put the breasts in the microwave; after about a half hour of microwaving and slicing with a knife rather than shredding, it all went back into the slow cooker, still on 'high.' At about 6:30 I took a deep breath and served it. Wonderful! The guests loved it, said the recipe's a "keeper" and only I knew what had gone into trying to get this easy meal ready to serve.

This is a great recipe for busy days.  I would decrease the cooking time.  I cooked it for eight hours, and it was a little overdone.  Next time I will decrease time to 6 hours.  It doesn't need anything added to or changed in the recipe, although I might try putting some onions in it.  Makes great barbecue sandwiches.

Again my whole family enjoyed ....would def add sliced onions next time.   And using a molasses based BBQ sauce did help it from being watery.

So easy and so delicious.  This is a favorite.  It is my go to recipe when I need something for many people and do not have much time.  Everyone always asks for the recipe.

LOVED THIS! Never would have thought the Italian dressing would make it so yummy! Just be careful to watch your time, even on low. Set mine to super low (10 hours) and it dried out and burned a bit. You could tell that the flavor will be awesome when I don't screw it up.

It's an okay recipe. I followed what others suggested and used a hickory chicken bbq sauce. My family didn't like it at all, and I won't be making it again :(

I made to recipe and for a small gathering everyone loved it and raved about it for days. I will make this one again. One thing to note, after I pulled the meat and continued to cook it, it burned a little around the edges of the crockpot. Make sure you continue to check on it and stir the meat once in awhile.

I only used three chicken breast and most of the rest because I like a lot of sauce but I hate to say that it did make too much sauce.  Just go with what it calls for it should be fine.  I like a little more tang than sweet so I would cut the sugar a little next time but this is a really easy and tasty recipe.

I made this according to the recipe ingredients and it was very good! Only difference is that I didn't have time for the slow cooker so put it in a dutch oven and baked for about 2 hours at 325 degrees. The sauce cooked down and was perfectly thick and tasty. Next time I'll probably add some finely chopped onions and green peppers for an added boost of flavor and texture -- just a personal preference as I really like those veggies in a barbeque flavored sauce!

While trying to figure out what to cook for an upcoming potluck I ran across this recipe. Used 3 frozen boneless/skinless chicken breasts & some tenderloin pieces I wanted to get rid of. Cooked it using Sweet Baby Rays sauce plus about 1/4 cup of Yoshida's Sweet Chili Sauce. I set it for 8 hours & took the chicken out at about 6 hours, set side to cool & shred. I left the top off the remaining liquid in the crock to continue cooking. About 45 min. later I put the shredded chicken back in (no lid) and let it heat back up for about 1/2 hour. I did wind up adding in a healthy squirt of BBQ sauce while it was heating back up because it had soaked up a lot of the sauce.  It was very good & I'm gonna make sliders for the potluck out of it.  If it was all adults I'd probably add in some garlic and red onion, but since there will be kids I'll keep it as is for now. Best of all I can make it the day before & let flavors meld. Very good, very easy and beats the heck out of the store bought stuff with all the additives in it.

I thought this to be really good. It was a little more on the sweet side than barbeque side, but that could have been because I used "honey" barbeque sauce.Otherwise a really good recipe.

Recipe seems  to need more info?  I would shred the chicken breasts maybe half-way through cooking, and return to the slow cooker to finish.  Good taste!!

Yes, this was very easy. But it wasn't very good. Cooked on high for 3 hours, shredded, then let it absorb juices on low for 45 minutes. By the end, the chicken was dry and the sauce still too watery. I used fresh chicken. I won't bother making this one again.

Great recipe! Easy to follow. I used garlic and onions as other reviewers suggested. I used fresh chicken breasts, and I added a little white wine to the crock pot! I put the crock pot on for 6 hours; however you won't need all of that time. Just follow the easy directions...the crock pot is your friend!

It just needed a little bit more brown sugar for my little ones (the bbq sauce I used was a little too spicy) and they gobbled it up. I put it on sourdough bread with a little provolone... delicious!

This was really really good. I didn't have any brown sugar, but I did add a tablespoon of grape jelly (IDK if it made a difference). I used 2 chicken breasts, half frozen, and cooked on high for 4 hours. I chopped it up with a fork around 2 hours, and shredded it at 3 hours. I used the Thick and Spicy Kraft BBQ sauce, and it was really good! Served with corn. Will definitely make again!

I just used Sweet Baby Ray's original BBQ sauce and a bit of Worcestershire sauce, no dressing or sugar and it was very good.  My daughter said it reminded her of beef jerky (not me).  Cooked 4 fresh chicken breasts on high for 3 hours and then shredded it, added a bit more BBQ sauce and cooked another hour or so on low.  Would make again, and try the dressing next time.

Excellent. The BBQ sauce makes or breaks this, so don't skimp on quality. (Sweet Baby Ray's recommended, but that's just me.) FYI,if the chicken is frozen, it takes about 10 hours, not 8!

I tried this recipe and everyone loved it!! I did change a couple of things though. I only used 1/8 cup brown sugar, added 1/8 tsp cumin, 1 tsp liquid smoke,2 fresh cloves garlic and used fresh chicken and Jack Daniels bbq sauce. I also used the Italian dressing and worcestershire sauce. This is by far the best BBQ I have ever had! Thank you so much! This will be a regular in my household.

Great recipe! I slow cooked the chicken for a few hours(about 3) in beer. Drained and shredded it, then added the bbq sauce mixture(I used Sweet Baby Ray's). My family loved it!

Made this a few times, cut down/omitted the brown sugar. Definitely a keeper. Cooked on low, after 4 hours removed the chicken to shred it, then put it back and let it finish cooking. Served with mash or on rolls.

This was recommended to me by my friend.  It came out great and my hubby liked it :-)  It was super easy.  I followed the recipe as listed and used Jack Daniels Hickory Brown Sugar bbq sauce (i think, my husband picked it up).  Will be making this again :-)

Made this last night and served on a whole wheat bun with roasted baby potatoes and corn. My VERY picky 4 year old liked it and that says a lot considering she hates trying new food and only seems to like chicken nuggets and pizza! So this will go into our rotation. I followed the recipe except I halved it for three chicken breasts, used fresh chicken instead of frozen, Sweet Baby Rays Original BBQ Sauce, Newman's own light italian dressing and seasoned the chicken breasts with garlic and onion powder and a little salt and pepper. I will make this again. Easy recipe, easy cleanup. I had no trouble with the end result being watery. After I shredded the chicken (an hour before done, as suggested by many reviewers), it was perfect. I cooked this on high for about 3 and a half hours.

I thought this chicken had a little sweetness to it but it lacked something. In all, I would definitely make it again adjusting it. I agree that there is a little too much barbecue sauce in it and my chicken got done in a half the time given.

I cut this recipe down to 4 breasts and adjusted the ingredients to fit. The sauce was delicious but a little too watery for my taste - which was probably caused by the chicken being frozen when I put it in. But I would definitely make this again!

I followed the recipe to the T-used Baby Rays BBQ and Kraft Italian Salad Dressing. The final product was barely edible. The sauce was sooo watery! The chicken was moist but the sauce was very vinegary tasting. Barely edible.

So easy and so good!!  I even used a cheap barbeque sauce and it was still good. I didn't add the full amt of sugar it called for and I'm glad I didn't because it was sweet enough with the barbeque sauce.

It turned out great!! I only added 5 frozen chicken breasts, but followed the rest of the recipe. I set the slow cooker on high for 4 hours. I spooned out most of the liquid into a bowl and shredded the chicken with 2 large forks. Then we put some of the bbq onto a bun and added some of the sauce from the bowl. My dad and little boy (who is a very picky 7 year old) said it was awesome!!

The first time I made this I followed the directions and it was a little too sweet.  I omitted the brown sugar the second time, and it was excellent.  I had 3 fresh large breasts, pounded thin, and 5 hours on low was perfect.  I shredded the chicken and added a little more sauce (I only used 3 breasts, but made the full amount of sauce) after 4 hours.

This is amazingly good and will definitely be one of my go to recipes!!  I made this recipe exactly as it states, except for the brown sugar which I reduced to just a couple of tsp since I used Jack Daniel's Honey BBQ and it was sweet enough on its own. I cooked on high for 3.5 hours, shredded and put back in sauce for another 1/2 hour or so and the chicken was to die for :)

I used Kansas City BBQ sauce and creamy Italian Dressing.  It turned out wonderful. I cut all the fat off the chicken breasts and the chicken was easy to shred after it cooked.  I served directly from the crock pot, along with Cindy's Coleslaw.  Excellent!

A terrific recipe.  I followed it nearly to the letter.  Only difference was I used fresh chicken instead of frozen.  I cooked it for 4 hours in the slow cooker and it was great.  Like others, I shredded it after 3 hours and then threw it back in for the final hour of cooking.  Topped it with a (mayonnaise-free) apple cole slaw that gave a nice crunch and tart flavor to go with the sweetness and tang of the sauce.  This is a keeper.

This recipe was simple and enjoyable ... make sure that you use a good BBQ sauce. There are a number of good ones available, but the cheaper ones don't do as well. Adjustments that I made to the recipe include - adding: 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander, some dry rub, garlic and about 1 tablespoon of cayenne pepper. Since we made a larger portion, I added in corn starch (3 teaspoons) in order to thicken the sauce. Finally, we sauteed onions and served on kaiser rolls. For those who did not want bread, the meat was served on a salad. On a salad, this was excellent!

I made this yesterday using a whole chicken (just had to pull apart with forks and pick out the bones towards the end of the 4 hours on high). It was definitely tender and flavorful. I had to drain at about 3 hours in to ensure the sauce be thick since it was a bit watery for our taste. I used Bullseye BBQ sauce and Zesty italian dressing since that is what I had on hand. The Bullseye sauce is very bold so it was the dominant flavor. Maybe next time I will use a milder, less smokey sauce. Overall a tasty dish served pulled over rice and onions. Thank you Zanne Tastic for sharing :)

YUM!  Followed the recipe to the T.  I was hesitant about the Italian Dressing but it worked wonderfully.  Nice flavor and sweetness.  My husband actually liked this dish.  Thank you for sharing!

So easy!  I was sold on it when I saw that you don't have to thaw the chicken first.  It turned out great.  I topped it with jarred jalepeno peppers.

I made this recipe a couple days ago for my boyfriend and I and it's already gone. I usually cut recipes in half since it's just the two of us, but I should have made the full 6 serving recipe on this one. I took advice from previous reviews and added diced red onion (1/2), 2 cloves of garlic, and 1Tbs liquid smoke. I used Jack Daniels honey BBQ and Wishbone Italian dressing. Instead of serving it on a bun I served it on sweet potatoes and topped it with pickles and red onion. My bf also loves pickled jalepenos so he added those...but I'm not sure I'd recommend that concoction across the board. We loved it! Thanks for sharing :)

Easy and tasty. I used a pkg of boneless, skinless thighs because that's my preference for taste and shredding ease. My crockpot is a beast, so I had this dinner on the table in less than 3 hours start to finish. I recommend using a packet of Italian dressing to taste instead of the liquid variety. Used Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory & Brown Sugar and added a small, sauteed sweet onion about an hour before done. Served on whole wheat buns toasted with a little butter and garlic powder, a sprinkling of cheddar cheese (some extra raw onion for me), some butter lettuce, and a side of sweet potato fries. This will remain on the rotation...thanks!

This was pretty good. I only had some chicken thighs with bone on but it still came out very well. I thawed them first to be on the safe side. I cooked them on low for six hours and then took them off the bone which came off nice and tender. Also, I didn't have any Italian dressing so I actually used ranch! But it still came out very good.

This is such an amazing recipe!  I was a bit skeptical about the italian dressing, but it turned out great.  Like other reviewers have suggested, its very important to use fresh chicken, or have it fully thawed before putting it in the slow cooker.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and 'pulled' the chicken after 3 hours on high, then put it back in for 1 other hour.  I did find that it was a bit too liquidy, but my boyfriend said it was perfect!  DELICIOUS awesome recipe!

Loved the reviews so I just had to try this one. I cut the recipe in half thinking that since it was only to feed two adults and three young children the full recipe would be way too much. Boy was I wrong, while the amount definitely would have been plenty normally, this was so tasty that all three of my kids gobbled it right up and were asking for more (even my picky almost 2 year old!!!) I will definitely be making this one again and making the full recipe so that we may even get some leftovers next time around! I didn't even tweak the recipe at all like I typically do with anything that I make- it was delicious just the way it was! Thanks for sharing this has quickly become a family favorite and I have already been having requests to make it again! :-)

This was a great recipe! Very easy, very hands off. I followed the recipe exactly (a little bit less Italian dressing). I used a value pack of chicken from Trader Joe's of 3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts with rib meat- it was roughly about 3 pounds of meat. I had to remove the tendon, but it saved me a lot of money. I cooked it on high for 3 hours, then turned it down to low for 1 hour. Then, I shredded it by pulling it apart with 2 forks and mixed it up with the sauce and kept it on warm until my guests arrived. I served it with whole wheat buns, and everyone liked it.

Very delicious recipe.  Instead of frozen chicken I used Chicken breast halves (which is on the bone) and I cooked on high in my crock pot for 3 hours in a can of chicken broth.  I then strained out the juice and fat and shredded the chicken, putting the chicken back in the crock pot with the bbq mixture I cooked on low for one more hour.  Chicken was so tender and juicy! Tasted great on Kaiser rolls with red onion and cheddar cheese.

Excellent recipe!  We've made it twice now and I agree with a previous poster that you've got to use a good BBQ sauce to begin with - we used Baby Ray's and it was delicious!  We also added a bit of Wine and Pepper Worcestershire sauce we had on hand along with some regular sauce although I'm not sure if that made much of a difference.  Both times, I also used thawed chicken and it seemed to turn out fine as well.  New fave!!

Fantastic!  I used about 1 1/2 lbs of boneless breast tenders and used my 2 quart slow cooker on high setting and the chicken was done and ready to be shredded in about 3 1/2 hours.  I added chopped green pepper and onions just because I needed to use them up.  The remaining sauce was a bit watery so I added a heaping tablespoon of flour and it rethickened nicely.  Will definately be making this one again!

Followed recipe as is, except for reducing cook time.  Cooked low and slow for 4 hours and removed chicken to shred; continued to cook for 1 hour.  Came out AWESOME!!!  Keeping this one for the recipe books.

Used Sweet Baby Rays barbecue sauce. It was just ok. Husband didn't like as we'll as my pulled pork recipe.  I think that was due to not having an onion in it while cooking, little dry added more sauce

We all loved this recipe. However, my husband and I, who ate the most, both got sick after eating it. I'm thinking that our chicken breasts, which were partially frozen and whole, didn't get cooked the whole way through at 6 hours on low. If I were to make this again I would probably defrost the chicken fully and cut it up before cooking it.

My family and I really enjoyed this recipe! I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I used Catalina dressing because I didn't have any Italian dressing, and it still turned out great :-)

This turned out awesome and was VERY easy to make as well.  Didnt have the Italian dressing so I used a Rasberry Vinegrette. Also, read about the runny consistancy at the end by a few viewers so I made sure my chicken WAS thawed, but after it was done there was still alot of juice. So, since I made this ahead of time, I seperated the meat from the juice and when it came time to eat the next day, I just added it all to a pan on the stove and added about a cup or so of just the BBQ sauce I used, which was Sweet Baby Rays, and it turned out AWESOME!

I used Wegman's Brown Sugar BBQ sauce (so I didn't need to add brown sugar)and prepared an Italian Dressing sauce from a packet. Used 4 frozen chicken breasts (large) and shredded at about 5 hours.  Put back in slow cooker in remaining sauce and cooked on low about 30 more minutes. This was excellent, made a lot of food and my husband, who is picky, said it was at least as good as any you would get at a restaurant.

This is another one of those slow cooker recipes that needs a different rating system.  There's a value balance for the ease factor.  The ease factor bonus applies here.  You don't even have to thaw out the chicken!  Just throw it all in there, and see ya later.  6-8 hours later, you have some decent BBQ chicken sandwiches.  Certainly not as good as chicken you've smoked on the grill, but it'll do in a pinch.

I did this one twice.  Once was fabulous and the second not so much.  Think it was more the BBQ sauce than anything else.

i did this with 4 breast halves (not frozen) so i just eyeballed the ingredients rather than using exact measurements. it cooked on low for about 5 and a half hours but didn't need that long. tasted good ... next time i may add a little liquid smoke or maybe some powdered garlic. i used jack daniels BBQ sauce.

This was simply delicious. I thought the sauce was missing something, so I added 4 oz tomato sauce and that did it. Perfect. I served it on buns topped with coleslaw. Yummy. Great recipe for having people over, easy and delicious.

We really loved this creative way to mix up what to do with our frozen chicken! The only thing is my husband says it's a little too tangy. So next time we're going to use a BBQ sauce that is sweeter.

I made this last night for dinner. We absolutely loved it! I did not add anything extra but I did cook it on low for an additional hour to get the flavor throughout the shreds. Came out divine. The right amount of flavor, extreme tenderness (I didnt even have to shred it, it fell apart when I stuck a fork in it), the edges of the sauce were slightly burned but that added a smoky flavor! Great recipe, definately share-worthy! Thank you.

SOOOO good! I cooked 4.5 defrosted bonesless skinless chicken breasts, used 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1 tbsp worchestchire, 1/2 cup Kraft Zesty Italian dressing and 20 oz of Sweet Baby Rays. I Put half the sauce mixture in, cooked 3 hrs on high in my crock pot, pulled the meat apart, added the other half of the sauce and let it soak in the sauce for another 30 min with the crock pot off. It was quite saucy but we like it that way. Even my picky 2 yr old gobbled it up!

This recipe is awesome.  Everyone that tried it loved it.  I, too, added diced Valdalia onion & sliced the chicken when it was close to being cooked through.  The flavors embraced the chicken pieces!  I used fresh chicken and cut back on the time. I didn't add any additional salt or pepper.  Fabulous.  This is definitely a winner that anyone can score with.

I tried this recipe exactly as written and it was just a TOUCH too sweet (I like sugar!) but still tasted excellent.  I made it a second time and used ONLY homemade mustard-based bbq sauce (which filled a 12oz bottle) with a sprinkle of worcestershire and it was the perfect taste, texture and quantity of liquid.  Great recipe, thanks!

This is a simple and great recipe. Make sure not to overcook. I wouldn't recommend cooking this on low all day, but rather for about 4 hours on high as the sauce will burn. Otherwise, my family and I love it just as it is. Full of flavor and can be eaten over rice, as a sandwich, etc. Great stuff!

This was an easy recipe. I cut it in half since it was just for me and my husband. We're not big football fans, but I thought it was appropriate for Superbowl Sunday. I would make this again. I followed other reviewer's suggestions and shredded the chicken after it had been in the cooker for about three hours.

WOW, THIS WAS AMAZING! My husband HATES chicken (as he calls it, yard bird!)...I get tired of meat/potatoes all the time so I try chicken meals every now and again...He usually eats them, but does not like them. I made this tonight and he LOVED it! He said, "WOW, this is great! What great flavor! Keep this recipe!!" IT'S A KEEPER!!
I followed the instructions above with 6 chicken breasts, but I did defrost them first. I used Sweet Baby Rays Sweet and Spicy BBQ sauce (18oz). I also added 3 cloves of minced fresh garlic and some dried chopped onion as well. Cooked it all day on low and served on buns! Great meal!!! Highly recommend!!!

Simple, easy, and as fast as your slow cooker lets you go. We've used a variety of acidic items in place of the Italian dressing, from red wine vinegar and olive oil to the Southwest dressing packets from McDonalds, and it still works. Versatile and great for families. Do strain the fat from the remaining jus in your slow cooker, and it can be used as a sauce.

Was VERY easy and tasted good. halved three chicken breasts, seasoned with some garlic powder and pepper, covered with the ingredients including sweet baby rays original BBQ sauce. Slow cooked on high for 3 hours, shredded the chicken and cooked for an additional hour on low. Wasn't to die for, but was very good considering the ease of preparation. We will make this again.

This is DELICIOUS!  I made it for my husband and he loved it too - which is saying a lot!  I used only 3 chicken breasts (had dinner for 2 and lots of leftovers), and I served it over Artisan Ciabatta buns with pasta salad on the side, super easy and incredibly tasty!  Can't wait to make it again!

Yummy and easy! I used Sweet Baby Rays Honey BBQ sauce, so I did not add brown sugar, and I made Good Seasons Italian Dressing for it. Couldn't believe how easy it was, and made with ingredients I had on hand. Hubby and Kids loved it too!

Simple recipe, excellent results. Followed the directions, used Jack Daniels bbq sauce and zesty italian dressing. Great for potlucks, was a big hit at work!

Excellent. Made it organic and gluten free perfection for a small family. Here's how:
Used 6 boneless skinless organic chicken thighs for more flavor
2 boneless skinless organic breasts
Made my own italian dressing using Good Seasons Italian Dressing packet
Bullseye Original dressing

Dark meat was awesome and it was a total bonus that my family, who can eat gluten, loved it and I, who cannot, could enjoy a tasty gluten free meal as Bullseye Original and Good Seasons are gluten free.

Delicious!

I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe. Previously, I was purchasing pulled turkey from Wholefoods hot food section and it was very tastey the first time I tried it, however, the second and third time it was "ok". So I decided to make pulled chicken in my crockpot, which was even better and cheaper.  Love this recipe!!!

Loved this recipe, I did thaw out my chicken first, I know it is not safe to put frozen chicken in a slow cooker. This was such a easy recipe and the smell in the house when it was cooking was amazing. I really didnt change anything, I took the chicken out a couple hour's before it was done and shredded it and then put it back in the slow cooker and let it cook and blend together. I only made it with 2 breasts, because it would have been way to much for the two of us, so I used about a half of the bottle of BBQ sauce. I still had leftovers, will be making again yum

Honestly this couldn't be any better for how insanely easy it is.  I used 5 frozen chicken breasts for 4 people.  We each had one BBQ chicken sandwich.  There was enough left over to make 2 BBQ pizzas the next day.  My family LOVED both dinners.

Everyone in the family loved this- even my two youngest who are usually very anti-meat.  Hubby followed this recipe, only using 4 defrosted chicken breasts instead of 6 frozen.  Cooked on high for three hours, then shredded, and put back in juice in low until we were ready to eat.  Delicious!

This was great! I did (out of need) make some minor tweaks because I only had 8oz BBQ sauce, so I augmented with Heinz57 and Catalina dressing. I used a homemade creamy style Italian dressing. 

It was SO good. Going to become my go-to for shredded BBQ chicken.

My family loved this recipe!  It was so easy to make, too. I recommend using thick chicken breasts if cooking the full 8 hours so it stays moist.

This is such a great recipe, I make it about twice a month.  It is super fast to throw together and the kids and hubby all love it.  It is just a little too sweet and juicy for us so I either cut back slightly on the sugar and BBQ sauce, or keep that the same and add another chicken breast.

DELICIOUS!  I looked through some of the negative comments, and it seems to me that your final result can vary quite a bit depending on your BBQ sauce.  So pick your sauce carefully.  I used KC Masterpiece Original.  I think the amount of chicken used can also affect the consistency of the sauce.  For me, it was perfectly delicious.

Fantastic shredded chicken recipe. Very easy and delicious. My family of seven really enjoyed this. I didn't make any modifications except doubled the recipe and drained some of the fat and juice before adding the sauce. Perfect consistency.

This is my family's all-time favorite barbecue chicken recipe, and probably my most-used recipe from this site!  I always use "sweet and spicy chipotle" barbecue sauce, which makes the dish deliciously sweet, tangy and spicy all in one!  This recipe is simple and delectable... a definite keeper!  Thanks for the recipe!

I have made this recipe twice. The first time, I followed the directions exactly. It was good but not great. The second time, I used red wine instead of the italian dressing. The red wine really gave it what it was missing. It really takes this up a notch. Thanks for sharing!

Simple and delicious. IF you are like me and make your own homemade vinegar based BBQ sauce, it will still be good in this, you'll just need to add a little more brown sugar and maybe molasses. I fed masses of people with 6 fresh chicken breasts and I still have leftovers! Served it on fresh buns from Costco, will probably try it as topping for BBQ salad next. This is the simplest Labor Day BBQ Ever, thanks to this fabulous recipe.

As a lot of people know...I rate based on whether my husband and/or kids enjoy it because they are so picky.  My husband began eating the liquid like it was soup out of the pot before I could even serve it!  He LOVED it!  I didn't change one thing!  Here is how I served it: I separated the chicken from the liquid and shredded it.  I served it on sub rolls and poured the juice into small individual bowls for dipping the sandwiches in.  Sort of like...French Dip.  Was great!!!

This was so good!! I used bone-in chicken breasts instead, they were cheaper at the store.  I did use some liquid smoke and diced red onions like someone else did.  I enjoyed this so much and so did my husband, especially when I used Hawaiian Roll hamburger buns:)

My husband gave this 5 stars but I gave it 4.  I cooked it on low for 8 hours.  There was not as much flavor as I was expecting.  I did read reviews that recommended adding garlic so we may give that a try next time.  It was good on a sandwich.  We will be giving this another try when we need a easy dinner idea.

we LOVE this recipe! I use Famous Daves Bold & Sassy BBQ sauce. It's a great way to enjoy BBQ without a BBQ! I cook the chicken in chicken stock first for a couple of hours, then drain it and add all of the other ingredients.

Im sure this is fabulous as written but dont do what I did...The barbecue sauce I used was vinegar and pepper carolina sauce.  Simmered all day..which turned out too spicy to eat.  I am sure with regular BBQ sauce this is delicious.

I made it using this recipe, the only thing that I did different was using fresh chicken breasts instead of frozen ones. It was delicious! I will attach a picture of it, but you can see more tasty pictures of it in my blog at www.creativesideofme.com

EXCELLENT & EASY!! I used a whole cut up raw chicken, put in crock with rest of ingredients, cooked on low for 4.5 hrs then shredded chicken, put back in for another 2 hrs. NOTE: 30 mins before done, sprinkled some cornstarch to thicken, might not have needed it but I didn't want it too thin -- the shredded chick does thicken the sauce. The smell throughout the day was amazing! I served on toasted Kaiser rolls w/coleslaw & sliced watermelon. Everyone ate these so fast I didn't get a chance to take a picture! Teens used leftovers for everything from burritos to omelets! GREAT RECIPE!! YUMMM

This is a fabulous recipe. I cooked about 8 hours on low, but I was at home and able to check it and stir.  The reviews which said it dried out baffled me... At any rate, everybody at my house loves this and I make it at least once a month. Thanks for this keeper!

My kids loved this.  They asked me to make it again the next night.  I used fat free Italian dressing, and Splenda brown sugar mix to cut down on fat and calories, Jack Daniels BBQ sauce, and added a some minced garlic.

This was very good.  I cut the recipe in half to feed my small family, and 2 large breast halves were perfect.  I also took others' advice & shredded the chicken once cooked, then warmed it in the crockpot for another 30 minutes.  Next time I will slightly decrease the amount of Italian dressing as we prefer a sweeter barbecue taste.  Overall a very simple, delicious recipe.

Just the best and easiest BBQ chicken ever! I use 2 breasts and shred it when cooked through. Makes for a perfect meal! Even my dog Bella loves it to spice up her normally dull dry dog food. The only way I can get her to eat!!!! :-)

It was very good. I made this for 2 people +leftovers only. I didn't have  italian dressing so I added 1/4 cup balsamic fig dressing. I added some (maybe 1/4 or less) molasses since my bbq sauce was vinegar based; less bbq sauce (because of the previous addition), and a few drops of siracha for spice. It also went well served with raw red onions.

Thank you to previous reviewers for the tips (about the molasses and the red onions). I wouldn't be afraid to sub for the italian dressing, as my version (based on what I had in my pantry) turned out fantastic. I don't think I'll make pulled pork again; this was as good (and a lil' bit less fatty)

This was the best best BBQ chicken. I was a little hesitant because of the Italian dressing, but followed the recipe exactly...shredded the chicken at hour three. Let it cook fr another half an hour to soak up some of the liquid. It was unbelievably delicious. My family loved it and I will definitely be making it again!!!! I used fresh chicken not frozen. I also used Sweet Baby Rays hickory and brown sugar BBQ sauce.

AWESOME recipe.  I shredded the chicken after it was cooked through by placing it in my kitchenaid mixer and beating it with the paddle  attachment.  Quick and easy way to get perfectly shredded chicken.   I put the shredded chicken back in the crockpot to simmer in the sauce for a couple more hours.   Very yummy!!  I did not alter sauce recipe but did use fresh chicken breasts.

Everyone in the family loved it, and my 20 month old had seconds. Definitely a keeper. I halved the recipe for a family of four (2 small children), and we have enough for lunch tomorrow. I served it on hotdog buns, as that was all I had. Toasted, they held up great. Definitely will make this again.

When I did this step by step I personally found the sauce to be far to runny. I would highly recommend cooking the chicken in the slow cooker separate, drain the liquids after pulling it apart, than adding the sauce. I'm going to let it sit over night, and try tomorrow in the morning after the sauce thickens in the fridge.

This was amazing! I used Jack Daniels BBQ sauce as one reviewer suggested and it was just fabulous. I would think it would be great for company or a party, too, since it makes a lot. Definitely will be adding this to the rotation!

Excellent recipe.  This was my first time making "Pulled" chicken - and it was wonderful.  My husband has been eating warmed up for lunch and says it is just as good 2 days later as it was the first night.

Delicious!!! This is definitly going in my recipe book. i added some chopped red peppers, onions, and mushrooms to mine for a little extra oomph. I also didn't use frozen chicken. I cooked it on high for 4 hours and it was fully cooked and it shredded with ease.

I have never written a review before but I make this recipe all the time. It is a favorite among my family. I made it at a family gathering and it was a hit. It is a great crock pot recipe! I do make some changes. First, I only use Famous Daves BBQ sauce. I have used other sauces and this one gives the recipe the best taste. The Texas Pit flavour combined with zesty itallian dressing makes the chicken tangy though. I only use 3 or 4 FRESH chicken breasts, I never cook frozen meat. I make this two ways, one way is I cook the chicken in the crock pot on low for 4 hours using chicken broth first. Then drain and shredd the chicken. I add the BBQ sauce and cook on low for another 1-2 hours. The second way is I cook the chicken in the BBQ sauce on low 4-6 hours then shredd the chicken as stated in the recipe. I have had my chicken come out dry, to combat that I make another batch or 1/2 batch of BBQ sauce, depending on your tastes.

I didnt vary the recipe at all. I think 8 hours on low was a little long..was almost over done but still excellent over a baked potato with butter & cheese. The chicken was surprisingly tender even though it was frozen when placed in the slow-cooker. The only changes I plan to make next time are to shred the chicken about half way thru cooking so the sauce can marinate it better & maybe not cook quite as long. My husband got seconds of this dish which is something he rarely does!

This was fantastic!  I followed the recipe and made no changes.  Used 6 fresh chicken breasts and cooked on high for three hours, shred it, then let it cook on low for 1 hour.  I used Jack Daniels original BBQ sauce.  The shredding took a little longer than I thought, but still worth it!  My husband, our daughter, and even my fussy-eater grandson, age 3, all loved it!  Will definitely make again and again.  Thank you for sharing this!

I only had bone-in chicken breasts but gave it a try anyway.  After 6 hours the meat fell apart from the bone and was delicioius.  I didn't have Italian dressing either but it turned out delicious.  Next time I will try adding sweet onions to give it more oomph.

This is amazing!!...Instead of the Italian dressing, I used some brine poured off green olives  and also added some Thai Sweet Chili Sauce, which eliminates the need for the brown sugar...it's a hit with everyone in the family!!

I haven't reviewed many recipes, but this one has been such a lifesaver for me.  I have used this recipe so many times, and the key is that I make my own barbecue sauce.  I mix ketchup, brown sugar, a little molasses, liquid smoke, onion powder, salt & pepper to taste.  The liquid smoke makes this taste a lot like pulled pork.  My husband is a huge pulled pork fan, and he loved this and said he thought it was pork before I told him!!  I don't add the extra brown sugar since my sauce sweetens it enough with the brown sugar and molasses I add to it.  Doing the chicken breasts frozen works the best for me, because usually chicken breasts dry out so fast when they are put in thawed.  Wonderful recipe! Thank you for posting!

Made this last night.  Used Sweet Baby Ray's sauce.  Much to seet for my taste.  Next time, no brown sugar.  Also overcooked it.  At 5 hrs on low, chicken way done.  Bone head on my part.  Put in only 2 breasts and did not take that into account.  Next time, will start checking at 3 hts.  Good basic recipe that is quick and easy and can be customized to your tastes.

Excellent!  I added hot pepper flakes and garlic powder.  I used a "zesty" Italian dressing and  I swapped Splenda brown sugar for the reg brown sugar.

My family loved this dish!! I followed this recipe as is and even used Kraft Bar B Q sauce which other reviewers said didnt work for them and it turned out delicious. It wasnt runny at all it had a very nice consistency. The chicken shredded easily. My family said this is a recipe they want again.

This is awesome.  One because you use frozen chicken (on those busy mornings when you realize nothing is defrosted) but also because it is so easy and it is delicious.

Very nice.  I did use non-frozen chicken, but I don't think that's a big deal.
It's hard to find a 12-oz bottle of BBQ sauce, though. So I'd go for saying 1 1/2 cups instead.
I also had thirsty breasts, so next time I'll be adding extra liquids so there's plenty of sauce.

This recipe is great. I made it exactly as the recipe stated and it turned out great. It is both simple to make and a healthy alternative to beef or pork barbecue. The whole family loved it. You could use it for sandwich's or eat it by itself.

This is my first try at making a slow pork and I have to say this was amazing.  Just sweet enough without being over powering. 

The entire family loved it and especially my one daughter that has to be one of the most fussiest people on this earth.

Thanks again for the great recipe.

I've made this several times. This is a great crowd pleaser. The better the BBQ sauce the better the way the recipe turns out. Once the chicken is cooked until tender I pull it out of the crockpot and shred it and put it back into the crockpot where it absorbs much of the sauce. I usually add additional BBQ sauce just prior to serving otherwise the sauce is too thin. This reheats well and freezes well also.

Good, not great. Added 1/2 chopped onion and minced garlic. Cooked thawed chicken breasts on low for 2 hours (until done) and then shredded and cooked for another hour.

Wow! Delicious and very easy! I cut the recipe in half. I knew I'd be throwing it in the crock pot before work, so I mixed the liquids together the night before. Substituted honey mustard dressing for the Italian, added 1/4 cup chopped onions and clove of garlic. Because I am paranoid about leaving the crock pot on all day while I'm gone, I added some chicken broth. It turned out PERFECT, not watery at all. Served on ciabatta bread.

I made this for the first time a few weeks ago and it was DELICIOUS! The only thing i did differently was used fresh chicken breast instead of frozen. I also listened to other reviewers and bought Jack Daniels BBQ sauce. The only thing that went wrong was forgetting to put the leftovers in the fridge and therefore had to throw it out the next day! I'm not exaggerating when i say i was upset about it for the next 24 hours. So i'm making it again today...will definately add this to my favorite recipes!!

Definitely a five star recipe if you use Famous Dave's barbeque sauce as other users have suggested. I've made it with the craft barbeque sauce and its just ok.

This recipe was a little too saucy for me.  I wish I had used half as many of the reviewers said.  It did thicken up at the end but it overwhelmed the chicken.  One tip I can share is to pour some of the salad dressing into the "empty" bbq sauce bottle - to get all of the bbq sauce out.  I might make it again but I'd double the chicken and probably cut back on the sauce.

Delicious!!! Did everything as said plus added onion slices to the crock pot, a dash of oregano and paprika, minced garlic, and seasoned chicken with pepper and sazon seasoning. Used 4 chicken breasts instead of 6 which cut down the ingredients by a little. I will definitely make this again.

My Boyfriend and I loved this! I added an onion, finely chopped, for a little extra flavor and served it on garlic buns. Delish!

This is really good - so good, in fact, that my husband enjoyed this recipe using chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts, and he usually doesn't even *like* dark meat!

This is AMAZINGLY easy and AMAZINGLY GOOD!!  I used Grandma Fosters BBQ and Red Zesty kind.  And the kids LOVED it, it is NOT to spicy but adds a real kick to it!  I will no doubt use this many more times because it is so good and easy!

delicious! so easy and with things already kicking around the house at any time!! My 16 yr old boy had 3 1/2 helpings (served on toasted buns), but that was not a surprise :) My 5 year old picky princess also liked it! Granted I did tell her it was a chicken wing (which she likes) on a bun to get her to try. She kept eating (gasp!). ALOT of sauce that I have saved as a base for a BBQ chicken pizza (who needs tomato sauce?). Thanks for the recipe!

This was really good.  I did change a little.  I used KC masterpiece sweet and Spicy BBQ sauce and then added some red pepper flakes and cayenne for heat.  Next time I think I will use a different BBQ sauce and omit the sugar.  I prefer a more savory bbq.  I did do as other reviewers suggested and shredded the chicken to absorb more of the sauce.  It was really good!  Lots of leftovers.

Zesty Slow Cooker Chicken was not as zesty or BBQ as I was hoping. This is probably due to the BBQ sauce I used. I would go with something thicker and smokier next time. My Dad thought it was good but not good enough to take leftovers. Makes a lot of BBQ so I would recommend cutting this recipe in half to feed four.

OK, I have been cooking for a while now, and am fairly godo with my slow cooker. Yet wen I do this recipe, following it to the letter, I get burnt, dried out chicken with the sauce caramelized to a black sludge. Every time I try to do 'bbq' in the slow cooker it's uniformly disastrous. I totally followed the instructions and everything, what the heck is going on?

Really easy and yummy! Very moist and tender chicken. I would leave out the brown sugar next time just to cut back on the sweetness. 5 stars!! My husband said I "knocked it out of the park." We served it over brown rice.

The only thing I did different from the recipe was using fresh chicken breasts. It was delicious and my daughters wanted it the next day for lunch. Will be making this on a regular basis in my house. BTW I used Sweet Baby Rays barbecue sauce.

Great Taste.  Used sweet baby rays bbq sauce and followed the recipe.  Added 2 tbs of minced garlic and a half of a roughly chopped yellow onion.  I will make this in the future maybe trying the chicken broth cooking method then adding bbq sauce.

AMAZING!

Maybe I used too much chicken, but we thought it was too bland.  We will add more barbeque sauce with left overs.

Was good but next time I think I will add more BBQ sauce. Not enough of that flavor for me. I loved that I didn't have to thaw the chicken first.

Tastes great and super easy. I had everything on hand except for the italian dressing so I just sprinkled in  a little bit of italian dressing mix and it tasted wonderful.

I let the chicken cook on high for 4 hrs and let it sit in the warm setting for about 4 hours. It was super tender and everyone liked it.  I will make this again for sure when I have frozen chicken I don't want to thaw out!

I made exactly as written and had no trouble with the chicken being frozen or the sauce being watery. Once I shredded the chicken, the sauce was fine and it was cooked perfectly, the most tender chicken I've ever made in a crockpot (8 hrs on low). The flavor though was lacking and while my family cleaned their plates, no one wanted seconds or leftovers. If I make this again I will modify for a little more zip.

This was really good. I made it for my parents when they came to watch my kiddos while we went to my husbands work party and they loved it. It was super easy to make. I left them some artisan rolls to make sandwiches, baked potatoes, and a ceasar salad. My mom is not a fan of super sweet food so I did leave out the brown sugar and I am glad I did because it was already a bit sweet from the bbq sauce. My husband ate all of the leftovers the next day. It is another keeper!

Loved it, loved it, loved it! Followed the recipe with the exception of adding some chopped onions on top of the chicken. At the 5 hour point I shredded the chicken and put it back in the slow cooker to absorb the sauce. My slow cooker cooks a little hot so I did need to add a bit of water to everything but it was great and will be added to my recipe box. Thanks for the great recipe!

VERY tasty BBQ chicken. I didn't have the Italian dressing though, so I subbed apple cider vinegar. I also threw in some chopped onion, but may leave that out next time. I'm trying it WITH the Italian dressing next time and I'll probably re-review this recipe afterwards...to be fair ;) It is a great fool-proof recipe. Just make sure you use a GOOD BBQ sauce. I used Sweet Baby Rays for mine cause I like my BBQ sweet and tangy.

Super easy to make.  I did pull apart the chicken with about an hour left to cook, and added a bit of flour to thicken up.  My family loved it!  Even made sandwiches for the kids for school today.  Will definitely be making this again!

This is quick and easy to prepare (aside from the cooking time), and very tasty and healthy!  I usually use a whole bottle of barbeque sauce when I make this; go with a high end barbecue sauce, since that's where 95% of the flavor will come from!

We love this recipe!! It was easy and tasted great!! I used raw chicken tenders and I also used some of the suggests of the other reviewers...to prevent from getting too watery I shredded the chicken after the third hour of cooking and I kept the lid off for the last 30 min to let some of the water evaporate. Perfect chicken and non-watery sauce!! Amazing!

About the sauce: I used Famous Dave's Rich & Sassy BBQ sauce as recommended by another reviewer. I personally won't be using that kind again - it turned out a bit tangy. 

I also didn't have time to put it in the slow cooker so I boiled/shredded the chicken and let it simmer on the stove for 35-40 minutes. It turned out great this way! My boyfriend and I both really enjoyed it, though again next time I'd use a different BBQ sauce.

This recipe was great and very simple.  I am always looking for new ways to cook chicken in the crock pot.  I have now tried this recipe twice with chicken and once with a 4½ lb pork shoulder.  Every time I make it everyone raves about how good it taste.  The only change I made is that I added a small amount of fresh garlic.  I have also tried using a few different types of BBQ sauce.  I have used Kraft original and Jack Daniels Hickory and Brown Sugar.  Both came out great, but the Jack Daniels one was a little bit tangier.  I will definitely be adding this to my family cookbook.

My husband loves this and he, literally, loves nothing I make.  I used the frozen chicken breasts.  I didn't have Italian dressing, so I mixed up some vinegar and oil.  I cooked it on high for about four hours, then shredded it and put it on low for another hour.  My family thought it was pork, but it didn't matter.  So totally easy and everyone loved it  I will make this frequently.

I have to say, this was a very tasty, different and easy recipe. I served this on whole wheat hamburger rolls and we all loved it. The chicken was sooo tender! I did add 1/2 an onion for some extra flavor. Definately a keeper!!!

Yummy!! I didn't make many changes - I used one small onion chopped up and my chicken breasts were fresh and had bones, which fell out easily once the chicken was cooked. I cooked on high for 3 hours, shredded the chicken and then put it back in the pot and just kept it on the warm setting for about 40 minutes.  My husband loved it!! Oh and I used cheapy Kraft bbq sauce and it was still fabulous!

I made this on Sunday and it was awesome!  I used 6 fresh boneless chicken breasts and cooked on low for 4 hours, then shredded the chicken and put it back in for addititional 2 hours.  The sauce was nice and thick, not at all soupy.  Had plenty of leftovers, even better the next night!  Loved it!!!

Good flavor and VERY easy. Flavor definitely depends on which sauce you buy/make. Shred before eating for BBQ sandwiches. Add sauce back to chicken and mix well before assembling sandwiches.

fabulous for a lean pork loin as well.   I put water in a croclk pot,  seasoned the 2.25 pork loin with mesqite chicken seasoning, and tossed the meat in to cook for  6 hours.  Just enough water to cover the meat.  Then I removed meat carefully, dumped the water and added the sauce mixture using Jack Daniel Hickory & brown sugar BBQ sauce. A new family favorite and great for evening tailgates.

This recipe is so easy and so delicious! The chicken came out so tender, making it easy to shred. Served on sweet Hawaiian rolls, yum! My family couldn't get enough of this dish. Thanks for sharing.

I always struggle with what to eat after church, we cant afford to go out every sunday, and I dont want to have to get home from church and spend an hour in the kitchen when everyone is starving, so this looked perfect. I used boneless skinless chicken breast strips and did everything else just like the recipe. It was really good, hubby didnt like the extra liquid in it and I wasnt crazy about the watery-ness, but it did have great flavor, it was even better then next day because some of the water seemed to soak up in the chicken. I think im going to freeze some and use it to make nachos or something down the road. Thank you for a great idea. I will make again, but maybe half of the sald dressing, or maybe ill add the bbq sauce and dressing after its shredded so i can eyeball the amount of sauce we like.

Great recipe! It is very versatile. When I use a molasses based bbq sauce I cut the brown sugar. Once when I used a vinegar based sauce I added the sugar in addition to some straight molasses. We usually use it in loaded baked potatoes the first night, and use leftovers for sandwiches through the week. So delicious!

Very fast to throw together and the teenagers loved it! I addedd a little ketchup and vinegar to it, dont like it too sweet, it was good. My chicken breast were not real thick so it cooked on low for 5 hours and was just perfect.

this was an awesome easy meal!! I was going to wait and eat it for dinner but it looked so yummy I had to have a mini sandwich before hand. The only change I made was I added 2 cloves of garlic and 1 teaspoon liquid smoke, i used kc masterpiece hot & spicy bbq and kraft italian dressing.

Yum!  Like others, I cooked the chicken in the slow cooker with 1 can chicken broth 4 hours on high, then drained and shredded.  The sauce wasn't too runny - just perfect!  The combo of ingredients is a bit strange, but it tasted great on a toasted hoagie, and the leftover to make a bbq chicken pizza (great way to "hide" leftovers.)  If you use a BBQ sauce you like, then you'll love this recipe.  We used Gertie's bbq sauce (comes in a jar) - delicious!

I have never eaten so many BBQ chicken sandwiches in one sitting.  This was the best thing I've made in my slow cooker so far.  I used Cattlemen's Kansas City BBQ and store brand Italian dressing.  I still thought it tasted incredible, but I imagine with higher qualities it would be even better.  I don't like putting frozen chicken in the crock pot, so I put mine in thawed on low for three and a half hours, then I shredded it and cooked it on low another hour.  Will absolutely make again.

I was surprised by how amazing this chicken was! It tasted better than my favorite bbq place, which is saying a lot since I'm from the south! I used 3/4 bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's for 3 large chicken breasts. I also added peppers and some onion. It looked like a lot of sauce until I shredded the chicken and then it was perfectly proportionate. SOO GOOD!

Pretty good. Made it for 4th of July cook out. Everyone enjoyed it. My only complaint is from the Italian dressing. It gave it an unpleasant after taste. But that's just me. I will make again next time with less dressing or I will replace it all together with something else.

I made this for dinner tonight for my boyfriend and I, and it really is delicious! (This is coming from someone who usually doesn't eat barbeque, but I wish this could be bottled or something. It's that awesome.  :) )

It's just sweet enough, just tangy enough, and even has a tingly little aftertaste. It's not overtly spicy, though, so it'd be good for both kids and adults. Give it a try!

Pretty good--3.5-4. I used 1 large (bone in) chicken breast, and about 1.5-2 c. chicken broth. Shredded after several hours (took out bones) and put in 1/2 c. KC Masterpiece. A bit too sweet--added Worcestershire sauce (1 T?) and 1/4 c. Italian dressing. No brown sugar. Pretty good sandwich filler--all but youngest liked it.

My father lives with us now and to say the least I have had to change my cooking habits! He is the pickiest eater I have known. I made this chicken last week and was totally blown away by the fact he ate an entire chicken breast. My entire family loved it and it was so easy for me to make. I can't wait to try some more new recipes!

This was good, but I found myself adding salt and vinegar to balance the flavor because it was a little sweet for my taste. Next time I'd probably leave out the sugar, but my husband loved it just the way it was!

Perfect. Simple and tasty. I didnt change a thing and it came out delicious. I used Baby Ray's Original and Wishbone Italian dressing.

Was good, quick, & easy. Recipe yielded a lot more sauce than what was needed but that's never a bad thing in my book.

A very high tastiness to easiness quotient. I was skeptical about throwing in the chicken frozen, but it turned out great. I used a bottle of Rufus Teague Made Some Sauce (Blazin' Hot) and a little bit of Stubbs to get up to 12 oz. It was quite hot, but full of tasty goodness. Definitely use a soft bun to soak up the juices and extra sauce.

Good recipe, however I was not able to use a good quality bbq sauce (made it on a whim and could only get my hands on Kraft). I lessened the italian dressing and did not use the brown sugar. I also added half an onion (diced) and minced garlic. Overall, the chicken was just moist enough and fell apart when shredded. I thought it was a little too tangy/sweet for my liking, though maybe it was because of the sauce. Next time I will try that Sweet Baby Ray's that everyone's raving about.

I had a rough start with my crock pot (open lid then off outlet) and this still came out amazingly. I picked this recipe one day because I could just throw in chicken breasts straight from my freezer. Of course after my initial mishaps I had to defrost said chicken to make it on time. In the end I cooked it on High for 2 hours, then pulled the chicken and cooked it on Low for another Hour. The only change I made to the sauce was adding a diced onion. It was delicious on toasted hamburger buns with garlic salt. We were so excited to have so many leftovers. We will definitely make this again. So much gain for so little effort!

Great recipe! Was a little sweeter than I would have liked but I think that was the bbq sauce I used. The kids loved it though. I will spend a little more on a better quality bbq sauce next time for a more grown up taste.

Your choice of barbecue sauce and italian dressing can make or break the outcome of this recipe. In theory, I like how this turned out, but I would like to try it again with a different barbecue sauce and dressing.  Very easy to throw together, especially if you use a slow cooker liner - it makes clean up so easy.

This chicken recipe is delicious.  I didn't need to add anything but I did season the breasts with garlic salt and pepper before placing them in the slow cooker.  Easy and delicious - you can't go wrong with this one.

Since I love the taste of any barbecued, I barbecued the chicken breasts first, tore them up and then threw them in the slow cooker with the rest of the ingredients for a couple of hours on low. Great taste and easy recipe!

This was excellent! I used 4 thawed skinless boneless breasts, sliced them in half, and poured the marindate, which i let sit overnight, on top. Also added some garlic power, cooked on low for 8 hours. It shredded easily and was amazing!!

Good, but was a bit too sweet. We used fresh chicken, hickory bbq sauce, white sugar because that is all we had, and skipped the worcestershire sauce because we were out. Used toasted buns and topped off with lettuce and tomato.
**UPDATE** Left overs the next day weren't so sweet. I think the sauce evened out. Also, I used American cheese  without the veggie topping and I enjoyed it much more. I now give this a 4 star instead of a 3 rating.

Good! Made 3 servings instead of 6. Added in chopped onions. I used Stubb's BBQ sauce and Zesty Italian dressing. It turned out to be a bit runny and so I added a tbsp of cornstarch. Great flavor, but a bit mild for our tastes. Not sure what I would add next time to make it bolder, perhaps more BBQ? Besides that, will definitely make again!

Delicious. I used 3 chicken breasts, 9oz of BBQ, and omitted the Worcestershire. I will definitely use the full 12oz of BBQ next time. Leftovers are just as tasty!

I added chicken broth and a chopped onion for the first 4 hours, then dranined and added all other ingredients, plus a cup of the broth, then let cook for another hour. Otherwise followed the recipe, and it was awesome!  Definitely one our family will have often!

This was ok for a slow cooker recipe.  It was kinda dry and bland, even with all the bbq sauce.  I served it on fresh baked onion bunns, which didn't really help much.  I probably won't make this again.  Its not bad... it just didn't stand out.

Followed recipe exactly, and it was really great. Sauce was a tad watery though, which is why 4 stars. It's a basic slow cooker chicken recipe, it would be great with things added to it. :) Super easy to make, especially if busy. Cheap too, most of the things are stuff you already have on hand.

So easy! I use Red Bull Original bbq sauce and Kraft Zesty Italian dressing and leave out the brown sugar. My kids and picky husband love it, and it freezes wonderfully!

Per other reviewers I used fresh chicken breast.  I followed the sauce recipe except I added a bit of cayenne pepper and cooked the chicken on high  for 3 hours. Then I shredded the chicken and cooked it on low for an additional hour. I topped the sandwich off with sauteed mushrooms, red onions and pepper jack cheese. Very tasty-thanks for sharing!

yummy! I used Sweet Baby Rays Original BBQ sauce. I added one medium onion and lots of fresh minced garlic. It was delish on onion rolls. I would try it next time on pork and will bet it is even better.

Made this with a Raspberry Chipolte sauce and used dry Italian dressing seasonings as I didn't have the liquid on hand. LOVED IT!!! I did skip adding the brown sugar because the sauce already had a bit of sweetness to it.

This dish is delicious and easy! If you are not such a confident cook like me, I highly recommend trying out this recipe! I am usually just cooking for my boyfriend and myself, so there is plenty leftover to throw into a bbq chicken salad for the next evening!

How great!  I used Sweet Baby Ray's Sweet and Spicy sauce.  This recipe is so forgiving you can use whatever sauce you like!  Next time I will add onions, though.  I was amazed how tender the chicken was even though I put the breasts in the slow cooker frozen.  There is a chicken taco soup on this site that also uses frozen breasts, and they come out nice and tender, too.  Even though I used chicken breasts in this recipe, I usually use chicken tenderloins which I will probably do the next time I make it.

WOW!!! This is amazing

It works great with partially thawed chicken. I cut the chicken breast halves into 3 pieces. Cooked for 4 hours on low then took out the chicken and shredded it and cooked another 4 hours on low. 

Before shredding the chicken it did appear to be to watery sauce. However after it was shredded and stirred together and cooked 4 hours it came out AMAZING!!!

I can't believe how good this was...we love our BBQ sauce and are quite picky so I didn't know how well it would go over considering the Italian dressing.  The first time I didn't follow the cooking instructions because I had actually made two chicken breasts in the crockpot for soup and changed my mind so I shredded it and halved the sauce recipe and put all back in the crockpot to heat on low for an hour...turned out great.  The second time I made it as directed and didn't like it as well, the sauce was thinner and I couldn't trim & shred the chicken as easily.  I'll be using this recipe again & again.

Best Shredded Chicken I have EVER had!  I made my own Italian dressing and used Stubbs Original BBQ and it was the best.  Best.  Ever.  I wanted to add onions but I have a rule about following a recipe exactly the first time I make it.  It doesn't even need them!

This is going into the weekly rotation. We made it without the Italian dressing, added a tsp. of Liquid Smoke and a few dashes of Yucatan Sunshine. I also added a roux to thicken it in the final half hour. It was absolutely perfect. I bet it's going to be even better tomorrow.

Great simple recipe. You really need to pick a good bbq sauce that you enjoy. I used Sweet Baby Rays Hickory & Brown Sugar and found the recipe to be a tad sweet. I think I should've omitted the brown sugar since it was in the bbq sauce and that would've helped. I will make this again with a different sauce & I think that will make it better!

Wow, I don't know if I did something wrong with this one, but it was a BIG disappointment.  Roundly disliked by all family members.  It was very strong tasting.  It would probably be better with a different BBQ sauce.  I used a zesty sauce, and would opt for something milder if anyone around here would allow me to make it again. I put this in the crock pot before leaving for a full day, and it cooked closer to 9 hours, so was probably overcooked as well.  My suggestions are cook it closer to 6 hours than 8, and use a mild sauce.

The sauce was decent but there was barely enough to moisten all the chicken once it was shredded. I prefer my sandwiches a little saucier. Also the chicken was definitely dry. I think this would be better cooked on a stove for an hour instead of in the slow cooker.

hubby and I liked it.  Healthier than pork.  1 out of three of our kids liked it.  I used Corky's bbq but might try a spicy less sweet next time.  Also, left the sugar out.

OK, I can't yet rate the taste b/c I just finished putting it into the slow cooker but I do NO recommend using frozen chicken.  It is impossible to prepare.  I couldn't get styrofoam backing off and when finally forced it off w/ knife, the paper underneath wouldn't come off. It took about 15 minutes to get paper off, scraping w/ a knife and picking w/ my fingernails.  It was disgusting
any my hands were freezing!  Terrible idea using frozen chicken!  Hopefully after all that it will taste good.

While this had a nice flavor, the consistency did not turn out well at all. It was way too liquidy, even after I shredded the chicken to soak up some of the liquid. It was almost impossible to eat on a bun.

Ok, I am no cook and when I do cook it never gets good reviews. But this was by far the tastiest meal ever! Better than the BBQ place from down the road! I didnt have Italian dressing though so I used Light Champagne dressing and it was perfect! I also followed the advice of broiling the buns after brushing garlic salt and butter on them. YUM.

Excellent and easy.  I used fresh chicken breasts, Baby Ray's Honey BBQ Sauce and fat-free Italian dressing.  Because I had no brown sugar, I just used some white sugar and honey.  Not having any Worcestershire sauce, I shrugged and just sprinkled in some dry minced onion.  Even with all my substitutions, it came out delicious, tender and was easy to shred right in the crock.  To keep it gluten-free, I served it with tortilla chips instead of rolls.  Delicious!

This was pretty good, but a little dry. I may not have put enough bbq, though, because I halved the recipe (I also did not put the Worcestershire sauce b/c hubby and I are not fans of it). Overall, though, not bad at all!

I have to start off by saying that I didn't cook my frozen chicken breast in the sauce because I didn't want it to be watered down like some of the reviewers stated. I cooked the frozen chicken breast in some water seasoned with chicken bouillon granules once the chicken was mostly cooked I drained the water and added the bbq sauce ~ i used sweet baby rays ~ and the zesty italian salad dressing. There was no need to shred the meat it was so tender it came apart while stirring in the sauce. Cooked for a couple more hours in the sauce and these were perfect!!!!!!! I cooked on low the entire time.

The chicken did not shred and there was waayyy too much sauce.  I either need to add more chicken or reduce the sauce next time.  Also, I cooked this on high for 4.5 hours.  Maybe it would be better with the longer time on low setting.  The flavor was good though.

cooking time is way to long.  4 hours on low from frozen worked for me. My chicken breasts were kind of on the small side though.  the chicken was nice and shreddable.

This was fabulous! I was skeptical, but it was truly amazing and so tasty! After reading some of the reviews, I thawed the chicken a bit to cut back on some of the juices. Instead of 6 chicken breasts, I used only 4 since there are just two of us. This would out perfectly, as there the sauce it cooked in was just the right amount. I shredded the chicken about 3 hrs after throwing in the crockpot. It really was tasty! I plan to make this again and again!

Great Recepie and super easy!...The crock pot does the job. I had it for my birthday and was a great hit! add little bit more garlic and half of the brown sugar, thought it was a little bit too sweet. I highly recommend it!

Great tasting. I used Sweet Baby Rays bbq sauce. It was a quick dinner so I used smaller pieces of chicken. I would recommend this for bbq chicken sandwiches. GREAT RECIPE

This was fabulous! So easy and turned out great. I was skeptical about the Italian Dressing, but it really did add that little special something. The only addition/change I'll make next time is adding some chopped celery & onions to the pot. A little bit of a crunch would be nice :) Will deeeefinitely be making this again.

This was easy to make, being that it was in the slow cooker. However, the flavor seemed to be missing something. It was good, but could be better. I don't know if I will make again. Also, I used sweet baby ray's barbeque sauce.

It was really good but not what I expected. It could have been the type of Italian dressing and barbeque sauce. I don't really use Italian dressing so I'm not sure which ones are good or not but this recipe is still SUPER easy to make and still very tasty!

Very easy. Next time I would add some jalapeños and hot sauce into the Crockpot to give this recipe a 5-star rating. The quality of the dinner depends on the quality of the BBQ sauce.

My first slow cooker recipe. I used a hickory barbeque sauce and I over cooked it a bit. Still pretty good, but definitely using a regular BBQ sauce and watching it more closely.

I used soy sauce instead because I didn't have Worcestershire sauce on hand and it still turned out amazing.  The key is to use a high quality BBQ sauce.  Big hit with the family, I will be making this again.

My family didn't like this.  It may have been the choice of barbecue sauce.  A brand name would help or at least the type of sauce.

Easy, delicious, and can be done in no time at all!  I've made this for myself and my family 3 times already and it keeps getting better! Try different BBQ sauces until you find the one you like.  We ended up liking honey bbq sauce, but have found that even the store brand worked great.

I made this with 3 chicken breasts it makes about 6-9 good size sandwiches. IT CAME OUT GREAT. Also had a friend over who didnt really like BBQ but she loved it. I didnt have brown sugar so I used 1 1/2 table spoon Sugar and 1 table spoon maple syrup ...

My 4 year old ate this  up! He ate just the chicken, but my husband and I put the chicken on a Baked potato with some sour cream and , oh, it was GOOD! The only variation I used was "Zesty" Italian dressing, instead of regular. Will definitely make again!

Good.  Not dazzling, but good.  It needs a little extra salt.  I also used an extra couple of tablespoons of bbq sauce.  Next time I'm going to add some additional spices and herbs to give it more flavor (thyme, pinch of rosemary, chili powder, etc.)

In a 6 quart cooker, I used 4 large chicken breasts, did NOT use brown sugar.  Added jalapenos, some cayenne pepper and a sliced onion (about 4 hours in).  Shredded at 6 hours, and ate at around 8 hours (on low setting).  Put it on a ciabatta roll. DELICIOUS!

Awesome and so simple.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's Sweet n Spicy bbq sauce and Ken's italian dressing.  Inexpensive and tastes great.  I will definitely make this again and serve for football games and other parties.

Used 4 chicken breasts.  I used Jack Daniels bbq and Kraft Zesty Italian.  Cooked on high for 2 1/2 hours then shredded chicken, added 1/2 yellow onion, sliced, and cooked on low for 1 more hour.  Served on potato rolls, everyone loved it!

Mmmmmm! Very good and sooooo simple! Mine was a little watery so I used the advice of  Audrea Rose to shred the chicken about 1 hour before its done. Worked great! The chicken soaked up all the flavorful juices. Great recipe!

The wife and I both enjoyed this recipe.  Didn't use frozen chicken and it worked out fine.  Will try to add a little more zing next time we make it though.  Perhaps will try a different barbecue sauce.

Yummy! I was recommended this recipes by a friend at work. i substituted the chicken for pork tenderloin because I was in the mood for pulled pork. Didn't realize I did not have Italian dressing so i substituted with  regular balsamic vinegarette dressing and it tasted great. Served with whole wheat bulkie roll.s The boyfriend loved it...it's a keeper!

Delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I only used 3 chicken breasts.  I threw them in the crockpot frozen and 4 hours later (on low) they were perfect for shredding.  I used Shirley J BBQ sauce mix for the BBQ sauce.  It was fantastic.  I will definitely make again and again.

Made this exactly like recipe.  Pulled the chicken apart and put back in the sauce for a little while before serving.  Very tasty!  A little thinner than I like, but I think it will probably thicken up real nice for leftovers.  :-)

This was great!! Easy and Delicious. Set in the crock pot and forget about it (especially if it's set to low, if it's on high you might want to stir so that it doesn't burn on the bottom). The only thing I did differently was add a little more BBQ sauce to taste, and after the chicken was fully cooked I pulled it (which soaked up the extra watery juices). Was a hit!!

Flavor of this recipe is delicious.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce, and Kraft Free Italian Dressing.  The chicken was a little dry when it came out.

This was really delicious and I will definitely be making this often! I live alone so I cut the recipe down and used one chicken breast (not frozen) and quartered it. I eyeballed the BBQ sauce, dressing and brown sugar (omitted Worcestershire sauce). Set my slow cooker to high and it was perfectly cooked in 1.5 hours.

Very simple and good.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's sauce which is already sweet so next time I will cut out the brown sugar as my chicken was super sweet.  I used 2 large chicken breasts, thawed, and they were finished in less than 4 hours (newer crock pot that cooks hotter).

This was incredible. I used 6 fresh chicken breasts, and due to time restrictions I baked them in the oven, and then shredded them. I put them in my slow cooker with the rest of the ingredients and let it cook for 2ish hours, and my husband has been RAVING about it. I actually used MORE BBQ sauce as the chicken I used was huge pieces. Wonderful!

My hubby and picky 18 month old son gobbled this down.  I had to add a little flour to the sauce to thicken it up but that was the only change.  I served the sauce over mashed red potatoes and it was amazing!

This was okay, but a bit of a disappointment just based on the rave reviews.  I used Famous Daves Sweet & Tangy BBQ sauce (which I normally love).  For some reason it just didn't seem as flavorful to me as I was expecting.  Oh well, it still made for a good meal and I appreciate you sharing this recipe, Zanne!

Delicious chicken! I cut the recipe in half, and cooked for 6 1/2 hours on low. Then I shredded the meat (it practically shreds itself, it's so tender) and cooked for another hour. Served on toasted jumbo burger buns, with Mushroom-Hazelnut Pilaf from allrecipes. com on the side. Yum!

My husband and son loved this.  I thought is was good but not spectacular.  This is not going to be a thick sauce but it is still good.  We used Montgomery Inn BBQ sauce, which is a local favorite and it added a good zest.  It is super easy and like the idea of a meat dish that is 300 calories or less.

This was good because it was tender BBQ chicken...but it just tasted like regular old BBQ, couldn't taste the other ingredients, it wasn't really anything special. We used KC Masterpiece, which is delicious, but I was hoping for something more unique tasting.

Perfect for my kids, although my husband thought it was too sweet and the sugar should be omitted.   BUT it could be because I used Cincinnati's famous Montgomery Inn bbq sauce, which already is sweet.  My two yr old is an extremely picky eater (turkey dogs and chicken tenders kind of kid) and she gobbled it up and asked for more!!

We absolutely loved this! It was so yummy and super easy. I used thawed chicken breast instead of frozen and after 7 hours I took it out and shredded it and cooked for another hour. It was done, but we weren't ready to eat yet.  I made a bit of a mistake by adding more sauce than the recipe called for because I didn't think it would be enough. It ended up making it a bit runny by it was my own fault. I still ate it on a bun, my husband ate it over rice. Will definitely make again, but I'll follow the directions next time!

Very good, and so easy. Followed recipe, but next time going to tweak a little by adding some diced onion, a little liquid smoke, and a little hot sauce for a kick.

I made this for a large family get together, and it was a HUGE hit! I always use sweet baby rays BBQ sauce, and i added some finely chopped onion, but it was terrific! My husband decided he didn't want it on a bun and so I served his over rice, and he thought it was amazing that way! We're having a birthday party tomorrow and I'm making this for sure!

Perfect, easy recipe that's very rewarding. I did add two tablespoons of liquid smoke as another review suggested. It added a bit more depth. I used a high quality bbq sauce and felt it was worth it. Chicken shredded easily and I did return it to the crockpot for about 20 minutes while I prepared the rest of the meal. Leftovers were a hit. Even cold on a salad.

This recipe is destined to become a family favorite. The only change I made was to use fresh instead of frozen breast. Because of this I kept a close eye on the pot because I didn't want the chicken to dry out. The total cooking time was only about 3.5 hours.

I love how easy this is and how tasty the results are.  I didn't get to read the reviews for any changes but I did the following: Used Liquid Smoke (1 teaspoon) instead of Worcestershire.  I didn't have salad dressing so I added apple cider vinegar with a bit of olive oil to equal the 1/2 cup of dressing.  I also used fresh chicken and shredded after cooking for 4 hours on low and continued to cook for 1 more hour.

This was REALLY good!  I used Sweet Baby Ray's hickory and brown sugar.  Thought it might be too sweet with the additional brown sugar called for in the recipe, but it was awesome!!!  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was absolutely amazing! I changed the sauce a little bit - 1/2 Fmaous Dave's Rich and Sassy & 1/2 Famous Dave's Devil's Spit in addition to the other ingredients. I followed others suggestions and shreded the chicken about an hour or so before it was done. Very easy and will make again!

This was a great twist on BBQ. The only thing I changed was is used pork chops! And they were delicious! This is a keeper! I think it would be a great sauce for shredded chicken or pork for sandwiches! Thanks!!!

I was skeptical.  Our favorite bbq sauce is Jack Daniels Original No. 7, which is a strong sauce, and I wasn't sure that chicken saturated in that sauce would be edible.  I was wrong.  I used Kraft Zesty Italian dressing, and added a whole diced onion and minced garlic.  The sugar also mellowed the flavor of the sauce.  As other reviewers mentioned, there appears to be too much sauce before shredding the chicken, but it makes the perfect amount, in my opinion.  I used 6 fresh chicken breasts, and fed six people for dinner.  I also had enough left over for lunch for four.  I served on toasted buns with pasta salad and corn on the cobb.  Everyone loved it!  Also, it's an ideal dish for college students - basic ingredients and simple preparation.

Very good. The chicken came out a little dry so I add water to the sweet baby rays sauce mixture and it thinned it out a little and made the chicken moist. Also add franks hot sauce cause I like it a little spicy.

This was absolutely delicious.  I made this from my husband and his friend and they went on and on about how delicious it was.  I don't really eat chicken but I ate this and thought it was great.  I added a little bit of honey to it and it was perfetc.  So easy to make but so tasty.

SOOOO easy and good!  The only suggestion I have would be to add a little more BBQ sauce - preferably just about 5-10 min before serving.  Otherwise it's a bit dry.

ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT! I made this the other night and I must say DELICIOUS! I followed the recipe to the letter except I substitued the 1/4 cup of brown sugar and instead used 1/8 cup of SPLENDA brown sugar blend. Same flavor...less sugar. I used Stubbs bbq sauce, but I think next time I will try a vinegar based sauce and see what I come up with, just for variety. I have no complaints about this recipe and can't wait to make it for our next family bbq.

I only had 4 chicken breast halves but this ended up the perfect amount of sauce for that much chicken. YUMMMMM. I used KC Masterpiece original flavored BBQ sauce and it was delicious. *edit* to use up leftovers make a chicken BBQ pizza: put shredded chicken chunks on dough w/pizza sauce and thinly sliced onions (in rings) and top with cheddar cheese. YUM

A little too much BBQ sauce for us.  I would rather had Adobo or Mole sauce.  I'll try it again w/mole.

I rated this recipe a three-star because that's where I think it comes in - right in the middle.  It's not bad, but it's nothing to write home about, either.  Nothing special!  Will keep looking for a knock-out chicken BBQ recipe because this is not it!

Just tried this recipe the other night and it was excellent! So easy and budget friendly! We did not use frozen chicken, so 6 hours was more than enough time for the chicken to cook. I will DEFINITELY make this one again!

All I can say is YUM! So easy! I used Bullseye Hickory BBQ sauce and I left out the worcestershire sauce, just because I was out but it was so delicious! I served on buns with coleslaw. My husband is a bird hunter and we will be trying this with duck or goose in the fall!

I rarely write reviews, but this is wonderful.  I make this with breasts or thighs (you need double the thighs and it comes out a little saucier that way), and it's always delicious.  It's a big hit with my husband, who is very hard to please.

My Dad was in town and being super busy with everything I didn't have a lot of time to make a great meal but this fit the bill perfectly. I followed the directions and used my fav Bullseye Hickory Smoke bbq sauce. It turned out amazing. Served it with fresh corn on the cob and baked potatoes. Everyone loved it! Thanks for an awesome easy recipie!

This was absolutely delicious and an instant hit with my large family! I took the suggestions of previous reviewers and cooked the chkn awhile and draned off the fat, then shredded it and added the BBQ sauce (I used Bullseye with Guiness) and other stuff.  Served it with grilled corn and ginger beer; yummy! Will definitely make this again!

Made the recipe as listed, except added a small amount of cornstarch at the end to thicken the sauce. Turned out great; very moist and flavorful. Will definitely make again! Thanks, Zanne

I like this recipe.  It is so easy and tastes yummy.  My husband, however does not like this.  I've tried it with just plain bbq sauce poured over the chicken in the crockpot and that works well too if you don't have some of the ingredients on hand.  I would make this all the time if only my husband would eat it!

Oh man!! This stuff is great, and OMG it is so easy!! The first time I used the slow cooker on high for the recommended time, did as others did by taking it out about an hour before to shred the chicken. I use only 4 chicken breast instead of 6, and it still makes plenty!! I did not change the quantity of ingredients either, the chicken just soaks it right up. A tip to some though, as it is cooking, it will get very watery!! I was extremely concerned my first time, because the mixture had turned into soup and I thought I had done something wrong.   The second time I made it (within one week of each other) I put the slow cooker on low for about 6 hours, again shredding the chicken to cook for the last hour. This time, the chicken just fell apart! I couldn't even get it out of the pot. It was fabulous as usual, but was a little watery. I suppose next time I cook on low I will reduce the amount liquids to see if it helps.   This is my new favorite!!! Thanks for the great recipe!

I was looking for a recipe for my grand daughter's baptism and wanted something easy that could be made ahead. Since we have some people in the family that don't eat red meat, I thought this might work. I tested it out, and it came out great! So easy and a great substitute for pulled pork. I'll use this for the party for sure.

I loved this recipe!!!  I love when I find recipes that I don't have to use the oven.  I added onions from other reviewer but other than that I didn't make any changes.

Wasn't sure how this was going to turn out because the smell was a little off to me while missing the dressing with the barbeque sauce.  In the end it turned out fine.  Next time I will add about a T of red pepper flakes for a little spice.  This was certainly easy to do on a busy night thanks for sharing.

I was really hoping that I would like this recipe.  I think that the right kind of bbq sauce makes all the difference in the world! I used Kraft original.  It was ok but I don't think I would make again.

This was very good, don't overcook or chicken gets dry. But the flavor is still very good.

Easy to make and quite tasty. I think next time I might add some green pepper and see how it turns out. I look forward to making this recipe again and changing it up with different sauce. Good recipe.

This turned out great! I deviated a little from the recipe, pulling the meat apart an hour before it was done, and adding more BBQ at that point. It wasn't runny at all!

followed instructions as written and the hubby loved this recipe.  While i did not have to alter this recipe, i did toast some french hamburger buns(more crusty, yum) and added a slice of jack cheese on top.  also made fresh coleslaw for the leftovers that i put on top of the meat before closing bun, delish.

I followed this exactly, no one liked it, and I have tons of leftovers. I am pretty disappointed. It is hard for me to rate it because I don't really eat meat and so I didn't eat any. The impression I had was that the sauce was mediocre.

Love this recipe! I don't know what I liked more the taste or the ease of preparing.  I used fat free Wishbone Italian and Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ and the only change I made was to add about 1T. of minced jarred  garlic.  I used fresh (not frozen) breasts and cooked on low for 4 hrs.  I shredded the chicken after 3 hours and added a bit of flour to thicken.  I served this on hard rolls with cheddar on top.  This will be a definate picnic staple.

WOW!! What a lovely surprise! I have to admit, I was very skeptical of this recipe with the Italian dressing, but I followed it anyways. IT WAS GREAT!! I didn't have Italian dressing on hand, so I found a recipe also from this site and made some fresh... it turned out wonderful! I cooked it for 3 hours on high in the slowcooker, then shredded it and cooked another hour. I had less chicken, so I lessened the recipe a bit and followed it as best I could, but it still turned out lovely! My fiance and I loved it! It was tender and very flavorful. Will definitely use this again!!

I am so happy to have found this recipe! It is SO easy and SO good! My chicken wasn't frozen. I used Newman's Own italian dressing and Stubb's barbecue sauce. I shredded the chicken (which fell apart) about an hour before serving so that it could soak up all the juicy yumminess of the sauce. Served on good kaiser rolls. This recipe is a keeper!

this is a very easy, tasty recipe!  I placed the frozen breasts in the crock pot and added the mixture of salad dressing, sugar and Worcestershire.  I then added the BBQ sauce.  Cooked for 2hrs on high, then had to turn down to low (went to the movies..) and cooked for 4 more hours on low.  Shredding the last hour.

SO easy and SO good!  I boiled the chicken and shredded it first so I could easily cut off all the fat.  Then I mixed it with all the other ingredients in the crock pot and cooked for 6 hours.  I served it on faccacia bread with cheese and onions.  Everyone loved the sandwiches.

I made this for my boyfriend and I for dinner tonight and we enjoyed it.  I scaled it back for 4 chicken breast halves.  The sauce wasn't quite thick enough, and I added a little cornstarch to try and thicken it up some.  Next time I think I would do a spicier BBQ sauce and I'd put less in the crock pot to start.  Served on whole wheat buns with salad.

My entire family LOVED it. I wanted to try something new with the chicken breast we had. This was so simple and quick to put together. I agree with everyone that you need to use a quality bbq sauce. I will be making this again soon!

I added red and green peppers, onion, and mushrooms.  My boyfriend and I thought it was good but was a little boring in flavor.  I would definitely add cayenne pepper next time and probably pick a different bbq sauce.  Definitely pull the chicken apart and allow sauce to seep in for 2-3 hours!

This is really good! Made no changes to the ingredients. After about 6 hours of cooking I shredded the chicken(because we were serving it on buns) and then put it back in crock pot to cook in juices another hour. Great flavor and since you don't even have to thaw the chicken breasts this could not be easier. I used Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce. You definitely want to use a bbq sauce you like since it is a dominant flavor. Thanks for great recipe!

I used some of the previous reviews - and made it on the weekend, so I could first slow cook the chicken in broth with garlic powder, salt, and pepper.  Then, I shredded the chicken and added the remaining ingredients (using a GOOD BBQ sauce), and cooked it another couple hours ... BEST BBQ CHICKEN EVER!  I loved it, and so did my husband, who is not a huge fan of BBQ.  I have no doubt that this recipe would turn our just as good if I would have dumped it all in at the same time either!  Will definitely make this again!

Very tasty!  I followed the directions exactly.  I only had the cheap bbq sauce on hand, but I figured I would give it a try anyways and it was so good!  It made my house smell wonderful while it was cooking.  I can't imagine how good it will be if I try it with the good sauce!  I also loved how easy it was, and I will definatly be using this recipe again!

left out the brown sugar as the bbq sauce added enough sweetness for our palate.  have also added veggies and some chicken broth to make an easy bbq chicken stew.

The chicken turned out really well.  It was tender and came part really easily with a fork. I substituted white vinegar for the salad dressing, which was fine (although I think that the oil in the salad dressing probably makes the meat more tender - I should have added a bit of olive oil, too). Pretty good as an alternative to take-out, but not something I'll make often - too much sugar for one meal.

This dish was awesome.  I used Sticky Fingers, a Carolina barbecue sauce and cooked it on High for 3 hours.  The first night, we had it on buns, which turned a little soggy, so the next night I warmed up the chicken and wrapped it in small flour tortillas with bean & corn salsa.  It was delicious!

This was such a great recipe!  I already had the ingredients in my pantry and it turned out so delicious!  I added some potatoes and carrots into the pot to make it a meal, and all my kids loved it.  There was lots of leftovers and I had a great meal to fall back on during the week, even a healthy snack for me.  I would heat up some peas and cut carrots along with leftover chicken and put it into a leaf of lettuce for some lettuce wraps.  It was a great, healthy pick-me-up!

A nice barbeque chicken, made just as directed.  I shredded when it was done and let it soak in the sauce for about 30 minutes.  This reminded me a lot of another recipe i make with pork in the slow cooker.

5 stars because it is such an easy way to get excellent results.  The flavor of the bbq sauce comes through, so make sure you use one that you like, but the extra ingredients make it different.  I used 5 chicken breasts and had a ton of shredded bbq chicken - the thick sauce really stretches the chicken.  Like everyone has said, it looks runny at first, but thickens perfectly after shredding the chicken.

This is a different spin on a baked potato. It was very delicious plus it was super easy to make. This is a good thing to make if you have to be away from home all day and need something fast and easy to make for dinner.

Great meal to fix on a busy day.  I put this in the crockpot in the morning and let it cook till supper time.  Every once in a while I would check in and chop chicken apart a little with a wooden spoon to make sure that meat was good for sandwiches(probably didn't need to do that but it was the first time I had cooked it)  My whole family loved this recipe.  My 10 year old son said it was DE-LI-CI-OUS  This recipe fixes quite a bit.  Our family of four got a meal out of it and I was able to put two qt. size bags of leftovers in the freezer for another meal...LOVE that.

Awesome! I shredd the chicken breast and serve it as a BBQ chicken sandwich.  I brought this to work and it was gone within the hour.  I had to promise to bring it in again for those who did not get any.  Needless to say the recipe was handed out to many. This has become a favorite in our house.

Fantastic! So easy to make, and absolutely delicious. I used Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ sauce but I think next time we will try a Jack Daniel's flavor. I followed a previous reviewer's suggestion and made a BBQ chicken pizza out of the leftovers with mozarella cheese, basil, and red onions. Yummy!

Delicious!  Made for company and ate the chicken as sandwiches...everyone loved it!  Have since used the sauce for ribs in the crock pot and they turned out delicious too!

This turned out great! We literally cleaned the crockpot! There was nothing left and it was great as leftovers! We ended up making BBQ sandwiches with cole slaw! Turned out soo good!

This was amazing.  The only tweaks I made to it was adding 2 TBS of liquid smoke, and I used slightly less brown sugar.  I used Jack Daniels barbeque sauce.

This is so easy to make and full of flavor. I put it on low and cooked chicken overnight. We had it today for lunch and it was very tasty. Good BBQ sauce is a must.

Chicken was very tender and easy to shred.  I felt like the bbq it cooked in was too runny to actually use though.  I took my chicken out, shredded it, poured bbq on it and baked it for a few minutes.

Very easy and good!  Followed the recipe exactly, except I used fresh chicken, not frozen.  I trimmed the fat off prior to cooking and didn't have the grease some noted.  After 4 hours on high, I shredded the meat and returned it to sauce for another 2 hours on low.  Made delicious sandwiches!

My family just loved this one! I really wasn't sure what to expect given how few ingredients there are in the recipe, but the Italian dressing added a nice "zing" to the barbeque sauce. My whole family loved this one and this will be a standard in our family ;)

Great recipe and sooooo easy!!! Made just 1 change. I never cook chicken with out adding onion. LOVE chicken but cannot stand the smell when it cooks, hence the onion. Did not have the problems some other reviewers had with their dish. Used Jack Daniel's Barbecue sauce. Added a little water to bottle to get all of sauce so gravy was a little thin. Served dish as shown with corn on the cob(frozen) and green beans. Excellent meal, family liked it. Made dish for Thursday night dinner, had leftovers last night(Friday) and looking forward to having barbecue sandwiches for lunch today(Saturday). Love pulled pork, never thought about pulled chicken until now. This recipe is a definite keeper!!!

This recipe was awsome.  My daugter is really picky and she has been begging us to fix it again!  We fixed it with baked potatos and made loaded potatos with it then with the leftovers we served it on buns.  Awsome!!!

I was skeptical - but the rating convinced me to try it. The flavor was surprisingly good. I used Whiskey Creek BBQ (Chipotle Lime) and I am sure that made a difference. It was a little "soupy" for just a sandwich, but on a potato as recommended, it was perfect! Thanks for a quick, easy, and yummy recipe! We'll certainly make this a staple, go-to recipe :)

Very good!  I made this as directed, using Johnny Harris BBQ sauce.  Served on hamburger buns that I buttered lightly and broiled for a moment.  Set slow cooker to high for 3 hours.  The sauce was a little thin so I added a little water with cornstarch.   Used leftovers on baked potatoes and they were also very good.

Thawed the chicken first.  Did not use the salad dressing and surely did not use this on a potato (prefer butter and sour cream!).  Made sandwiches.  It was good, not phenomenal, but good.

This was good.   It was very easy to make but tasted a little bland to me, however I left out the Worcestershire sauce as I couldn't find mine.  I may make this again and make sure I add some in.  I did use Jack Daniel's BBQ sauce though.

Five stars for how easy it is. As others have said, find a really thick bbq sauce. I used Jack Daniels and it was decent, but I'm going to look for something thicker.

I made this recipe on the day of the recent blizzard in New York.  It was perfect!  The only thing I missed was I did not prepare a green vegetable or a salad to complement it (I did not want to face the snow).

Excellent, I didn't change a thing. Threw the chicken in partially frozen, shredded at 3 hours, gave it another 30-40 minutes and then tossed it on potatoes - fantastic!

I have made this recipe several times now and it is awesome!  My adjustments include using Kraft zesty italian dressing, Splenda brown sugar blend (1 Tbsp instead of 1/4 cup), and soy sauce when I had no Worcestershire.  Despite previous comments on buying cheap sauce, I did use the 99c Kraft BBQ sauce (honey hickory smoke) and it turned out great.  This makes great sandwiches, paninis and potato topping.  I even mixed it with egg noodles as a leftover the following night and it was good.  :)

SO easy! Added onions and a little hot sauce since my sauce was pretty sweet. Cooked it on high, but was done within 3 hours. I shredded the chicken mb an hour before it was done.

This was alright but turned out kind of dry for me. I will probably use more bbq sauce next time as well as shred up the chicken prior to putting it in the crockpot. Hopefully that will give it more flavor and prevent it from drying out.

Made this very simple dish for a work Christmas potluck and brough Hawaiian sweet rolls for everyone to make sandwhiches. Turns out people liked it so much they didn't even notice the bread and it was gone before the rolls were even opened. So easy and tastes wonderful.

This really surprised me.  The only thing I altered was I used chicken thighs instead of breasts and added a half bag of frozen corn about half way through the cooking process.  It was declicious and easy, I will definately make it again.

This is friggin' FABULOUS!  Easy and delicious--just what I need.  It's great because you just toss some stuff in the slow cooker and come out with a week's worth of hearty sandwiches for the family.   I used Budweiser BBQ sauce, and I'll admit to being a little worried at first.  It smelled very strange (the beer in the sauce, I guess) and I was a little turned off by that at first.  But when I tasted it...OH MY GOD.  It was fantastic!  Excellent recipe--I've made it twice in two weeks, and I'm about to make it again for one of our Superbowl yummies tomorrow.  Thanks for the new staple!

This was good. I'm not a huge fan of BBQ chicken, but this was good. My husband loved it though so I'm glad I made it.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was GREAT! I cooked thawed chicken breast in the crock pot for 2 hours on low and 1 1/2 on high. I didn't have italian dressing so I used greek dressing that I had on hand. I also added red onion and garlic. I first cooked the chicken with onion garlic dressing, worcestershire sauce and brown sugar. Once the chicken was cooking I drained some of the liquid out and then added a bottle of sweet baby rays BBQ sauce. We had it on a whole wheat hamber bun,with potatoes and broccli! GREAT DINNER! And SOO easy!

I am a horrible cook, but I found this recipe about a year ago and it is one of my favorite things to make because it is so simple and so good!  I've used the same sauce combination but used pork chops instead of chicken and it works just as good!  I've also used the sauce combo for pulled pork sandwiches, a big hit with the hubby!

The italian dressing makes any bottled bbq sauce taste amazing. I tried it on a baked potato, but I liked it better on a hamburger bun.

I used boneless ribs in place of the chicken and turned out great. The only reason I decided to give it four stars was because the sauce was so runny and thin I could't use it for dipping sauce and felt like it was a waste of a good bottle of bbq sauce. Otherwise, the meat was tender and juicy.

This was sooooo super easy & tasted wonderful!  I used Jack Daniels BBQ sauce, and I shredded up the chicken when it was almost done.  While I had the chicken out shredding it up, I thickened the sauce with some cornstarch.  I served this over a baked potato with a side dish of buttered corn.  Great meal!!

Made this exactly as listed in the recipe. It was really good, I'd give it four stars if the sauce was just a little thicker. Otherwise, the flavor is perfect.

I made this today with Jack Daniels bbq sauce and added white onion, Cayenne Pepper, Apple Cider Vinegar, salt, pepper and the rest of the original ingrediance. I cooked 3  frozen turkey breast on low for 3 hours and they were done! Then I shreded the chicken and put it back on low for another hour. It cooked a lot faster then I planned but I was home to monitor it. Have yet to taste it. It's sitting on warmer until the husband gets home. Sauce tast reat though. I will be serving it on wheat buns.

Great flavor!  I didn't add water, as some reviewers did, and perhaps I should have.  It ended up being drier than I would have liked, but the flavor does make up for it.

This was ridiculously delicious! I was out of Worcetershire sauce so I subbed steak sauce and a little yellow mustard.  I shredded the chicken and piled it on toasted buns.  Everyone raved about it and it disappeared completely.

i've made this recipe twice now and just love it. both times i've used a jack daniel's sauce (original and hickory brown sugar this time) and it turned out great both times. shredding the chicken a few hours into the cooking process definitely helps it to absorb the sauce. very easy and yummy recipe!

This was so good. My husband who does not like leftovers said it was even better the next day. I liked the sweet and tangy sauce. Served over rice. I will absolutely make again.

Just plain awesome!  I made this chicken just as the recipe states, except I used fat- free Italian dressing because its what we had on hand.  (I was concerned that t was going to be a little vinegary, but it wasn't at all.)  I also took the advice of another reviewer and used a better BBQ sauce.  (Famous Dave's Rich and Sassy.)  I cooked this on high for 4 hours or so, took it out, shredded it and returned it to the crockpot for about 45 minutes on low.  We served this over baked potatoes and it was delicious, but it would be equally good on hoagie buns.  As good as it was when I made it that night, my husband and I both agree that it was even better the next day!  5 stars ... We'd give it 6 if we could!

made it and loved it! I have to agree... using a higher quality bbq sauce does help. I used Jack Daniels bbq sauce and i pulled apart the meat and used it as a topping on a baked potato... soooooo good!

Awesome! I made this a couple nights ago and we LOVED it! So easy and simple, smells delicious when it's cooking. Didn't change a thing about it. I used Chicken & Ribs BBQ sauce which had the right amount of smokiness. This will definitely be made a lot in our house!

Was very good! I would recommend pulling the chicken about half way through cooking and then let it continue to cook pulled apart. This allows the chicken to further absorb the juices to become more tender!

I thought this chicken was wonderful.  Not only was it simple (how many recipes can you throw frozen chicken in a pot?!) but it was so delicious.  We served it over brown rice last night, and tonight we'll have it as sandwiches with french fries and salad.  And for 300 calories, you can't beat that!  Mine made enough for 10 people too, so I'm sure it's less than that.  I'm allergic to an ingredient in almost all salad dressings so I made my own Italian with half oil, half vinegar and some Italian seasoning & garlic powder.  This was great  and I can't wait for the leftovers tonight!

As written, four stars. You definitely want to shred the chicken, and I wouldn't cook it as long as is stated. Added green pepper and red onion and fashioned Italian dressing from apple cider vinegar, olive oil and some spices. Pretty good served on toasted buns with coleslaw and side of sweet potato fries.

This is simply a fantastic recipe!  I made this for a casual dinner party and served over warm hoagie rolls.  Everyone loved it, and every single person asked for the recipe.  This is a great way to serve a large number of people without spending hours in the kitchen!

This was a fantastic recipe. I used thawed chicken drums and Jack Daniels barbecue sauce. Cooked for 4 hours and it was perfect. I don't like to over slow-cook my chicken, but at 4 hours, it was so wonderfully tender and falling off the bone. Next time I use this recipe, I will marinade the chicken overnight in the Italian dressing.

My boyfriend is in love with this... I am not as excited but it was still super delicious - I put this on hamburger buns with good quality coleslaw and it tasted great- highly suggest the coleslaw with it.

This was good.  I tossed the chicken in the slow cooker straight from the freezer... cooked on high for one hour, and then turned to low for the remaining 6 hours or so.  It seemed a little runny and less saucy... could of been because I used frozen chicken?  So I wouldn't recommend that.  The flavor was still good though.

Amazing...probably one of the best tasting dishes ive ever had.  I omitted the Italian dressing, but only because I had none.  I also used mesquite smoked bbq sauce and added a lil more Worcestershire sauce.  Delicious!!!!

This was a definite hit with my family. I did have to extend cooking time by two hours because I used chicken breasts that were larger in size. Will definitely make again but will likely modify it a bit to make it interesting.

I used six VERY frozen, VERY large chicken breasts for this recipe.  I substituted Ken's low fat Caesar dressing for the Italian because it is what I had on hand.  Everything else I followed exactly.  I took the chicken out after cooking on low for six hours and it was VERY close to being overdone - the reason for four stars.  This was probably perfectly cooked at 5 hours.  Cooking it for 8 hours would have been a disaster.  When I took the chicken out to shred the sauce looked VERY soupy but once I shredded all the breasts and put the chicken back in the crockpot to keep warm until dinner time, it was just the right amount of sauce to coat all the chicken.  I will definitely make this again. It made enough for my family of three hearty eaters to enjoy last night, enough for my husband to take two sandwiches for lunch, and enough to freeze for a future meal.  I did want to mention I used Sweet Baby Ray's barbecue sauce, it's the only BBQ sauce we use.

I really liked this recipe!  I was so happy I could throw frozen chicken breast in the slow cooker and have a delicious meal when I got home. I cooked it on high for 3 hours so it didn't dry out so much. Make sure to top it off with the sauce, or top with with more BBQ sauce.

This recipe worked out very well for me. I forgot the brown sugar entirely (oops)! I will make sure to use it in the future as I'm sure it adds something delicious to the Worcestershire sauce! I served mine on onion rolls, as sandwiches. Thanks for the recipe!

Easiest recipe ever!  I shredded the chicken when it was done and threw it back into the cooker.  There was a lot of sauce, so I left the lid off and reduced it a bit.  I think next time I might throw in a couple more chicken breasts since there was so much sauce (or maybe not use the whole bottle of bbq).  Definitely will make this again!

This recipe was very easy and came out delicious! All my friends loved it.  I made this recipe exactly how it says except I didn't use the Worcestershire sauce only because I didn't have any on hand.  I cooked it on high for 4 hours and then let it sit on low for a few more hours and then just kept it on warm for a few more to let the flavors soak in  and the sauce thicken (I only did this because I had the time to do it).  I also used Jack Daniels Masterpiece bbq sauce as I read it was best to use the more expensive kind.  Half-way during the cooking, I used a fork and shredded the chicken and it makes so much; perfect to have for leftovers.  I highly recommend this recipe. It's SOOO good!!!

We thought these were great! I used 3 large chicken breasts which were about 2 lbs total in weight. Used Famous Dave's Devil Spit BBQ sauce. Cooked frozen chicken on high for 4 hours. I thought there was going to be too much sauce, but once it was shredded the sauce absorbed into the chicken. Had a nice kick to them, which we love. I put pickles on top of my sandwich and my husband topped his with jalapenos and cheese. We will definately make these again. Would be great to serve for a party too.

I used 1 lb. boneless skinless chicken breast, and I cooked it in the slow cooker on low for 6 hours. I recommend using a good barbeque sauce, not the cheapest one you can buy, it will make a difference.  The amount of sauce compared to chicken was absolutely perfect!  This was soooo delicious.  I served this over a baked potato, but next time will be using fresh baked rolls for a great sandwich!  Highly recommended, you will not be disappointed.

This was amazing!!! I was very doubtful to try this...the frozen chicken, the salad dressing..all scared me a bit....but went ahead and trusted the other reviewers....it was so easy, so flavorful, and the chicken literally fell apart it was so tender. This is my go-to recipe now for using frozen chicken!! Thank you for this!!!!

The first time I made this, I wasn't sure how much chicken to use since it states 6 breast halves. I ended up buying 2.5 pounds of skinless chicken breast halves, and cutting them in half before putting in the crockpot, then cooked on high for 2.5 hours. The sauce was quite runny at first but thickend up after I let it sit for a while. My boyfriend and his buddies all love it.

This was awesome! I used jack daniels bbq sauce, and added about a tablespoon more sugar than what it called for. I cooked it for 5 hours on low, and the chicken turned out extremly tender and juicy. I served it on sandwhich buns and will be making it again.

The flavor of this was perfect. I did use less chicken and thought it was great. However my slow cooker must be really hot, it's new, there was a bit of burning before the time was up. Changed it to low about half way through cooked it for a total of 5 hours. Served it in yeast rolls with sweet potato fries. Husband loved! I will watch the timing a bit closer next time. There will definitely be a next time!

my husband loved the flavor (we used Woody's BBQ Sauce) but my little kids thought it was too spicy....will leave out the Worcestershire sauce for the kids next time. super easy to make.  cooked on low for 5 1/2 hours and it was perfect.... I am a vegetarian, so anything meat oriented that is easy for me to cook is a blessing!

We had this tonight for dinner! I left out the brown sugar because I used a sweet bbq sauce and added green peppers, red peppers, and red onion to the mix. I followed another review and placed the chicken on sandwich styles rolls. It made a great easy dinner for my husband and I! Will be sharing this recipe with my family for sure.

My husband requests this all the time.  It is so EASY and TASTY so I make it when he asks.  I don't change the recipe at all, super tasty just as is.  I do agree with other reviewers, don't use an el cheapo brand of bbq sauce it does affect the flavor.  We like to use the left over sauce on cold cut sandwiches and as a dip for chicken nuggets...etc...

Very good recipe and soooooooo easy.  I made the recipe exactly as written with Sweet Baby Ray's barbecue sauce.  My husband and I ate it all week (talk about easy!) for dinner.  He also recommended that we put this recipe into the normal rotation.......I will!

This was awesome! It was just as good, if not better than, our local bbq joint. BBQ sauce I used (and only ever use) was Sweet Baby Ray's. I made a few changes to the directions, I boiled my chicken for at least an hour to make it really tender and falls apart easily, while that was boiling, I put all ingredients in crock pot and let simmer while chix was cooking, and after I added chix, just let it cook on high for about 2 hrs and I felt it was long enough, flavors melded good. Next time I would probably just do on stove, I didn't feel it was necessary to do in crockpot, unless I won't be home and wanted to come home to a cooked meal.

I absolutly LOVED this recipe. I used Honey Hickory BBQ sauce and alone it's a little spicy but with the tangy Italian dressing, it was amazing! I shredded the pork and put it on hamburger buns. I ommited the Worcestershire sauce since I didn't have any on hand and it was absolutly delicious! Will make again.

This recipe was excellent!  This will definitely become a regular in our house.  Even my extremely picky toddler ate every bit (without complaint!).  I used Kraft's Honey & Hickory barbeque sauce and only used a little over 1/8th cup of brown sugar.  It came out tasting not too sweet and with a hint of a smokey flavor.  Perfect!  :)

I have made this many times now and it is always a big hit.  I make sure to buy a good quality brand of BBQ sauce and don't get one that is too sweet because you already have a good amount of sweetness with the brown sugar in the recipe.  I always make sandwiches on French or Dutch Crunch rolls and my guests gobble it all up every time.

So easy, delicious and healthy too.  I used Stubb's bbq sauce which is only 30 calories per 2 tbs serving.  I used the entire 18 ounce bottle.  I also used light italian dressing.  I omitted the brown sugar but it is so sweet from the bbq sauce that it really doesn't need it.  I only used 2 1/2 pounds of chicken since that is all I had on hand.  I also added a diced sweet onion.  I cooked it for 4 hours on low.  Then I shredded the chicken and cooked it for another 45 minutes on low.  It is juicy and saucey and perfect for sandwhiches.  I will put it over Arnold's thins and over hamburger buns for the kids.

I loved this recipe!!  So easy and great for a crowd.  I used boneless thighs AND breasts, added garlic and a little chopped onion.  Used homemade bbq sauce and italian dressing. Served on toasted HB buns with sliced red onion that I'd toned down by soaking in ice water.  Very good and will make again for sure!!!

Followed recipe almost exactly.  About halfway through cooking I tasted it and threw in some ketchup and mustard. It was incredibly easy and turned out really well. I did shred the meat, and I think that really helped with the dryness

This was FANTASTIC!!  I cooked it for 7.5 hours on low and left the chicken breasts whole, instead of shredding them.  I served this with French fries and cole slaw.  Definitely a fabulous, easy meal!!

This recipe was really easy and really tasty. It came out a little dry but we just dipped it in the sauce and it tasted great. I think if I had shredded it after some time and added more BBQ sauce it would have tasted more moist. I'll try it again with shredding and more BBQ. :) Thanks for the recipe!!

This is too easy to be this good! I have been making this for quite a while and I am always pleased with the results. I do DOUBLE the sauce, because we like our BBQ 'wet'. Use the food processor to shred the chicken late in the cooking an return it to the sauce to soak up the yumminess. I only use STUBB'S BBQ sauce, it is the best, period.

We had this some time ago and I am making it again tonight.  We loved this recipe.  We had it on regular bakery hamburger buns and my boyfriend ate more on top of his baked potato.  I will be keeping the recipe.  It's easy and fast to throw together.

Had it tonight for dinner and it was delish.  My husband ate three!  We love BBQ and this recipie is a keeper.  I will only do one thing differently next time and that is omit the brown sugar.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and it is sweet enough on its own.  I made the chicken the day before.  I cooked off a small fryer chicken and removed the meat from the bone.  We needed something quick tonight so, I just threw the chicken in the crock pot two hours before we needed to eat put the wet ingredients on top and walked away.  A keeper.  Only four stars because of the sweetness factor.

I also used sweet baby ray's bbq sauce and some el-cheapo store brand italian dressing.  After about 7 hours I shredded it in the slow cooker, waited another hour and served with shredded cheddar cheese on a toasted bun.  The bread was a bit of a challenge becasue it got soggy but it with a fork and knife it went down real nice!  I will try a bread bowl next time as the last person suggested!

Great!  I added liquid smoke, used honey barbeque sauce, and reduced the brown sugar to half the amount listed because of the sugar/sweetness in the bbq sauce. I also didn't have enough Italian dressing, so I used what little I had along with some Caesar Italian.  I shredded the chicken after one hour on high and about 4 1/2 hours on low, then added it back to the slow cooker and cooked on low for 40 more minutes.

I think this turned out pretty good.  I may have left it in the slow cooker too long, and it got a bit dry.  I'll have to try it again and leave it in for a little less time.

Awesome recipe! I only had 3 large boneless skinless chicken breasts but kept the measurements the same. It came out just fine. My chicken was done within 3-4 hours on low. Then I shredded it and let it warm for another hour or 2. Thanks for sharing!

These were ok. Nothing special. No one was impressed. Seemed like regular barbque chicken. I followed the recipe and used a good sauce. I think they cook alot faster than called for. I wont be making them again for sure.

Love it! ALWAYS get complimented on this one!I have been making this for a couple of years and finally became a member of "all recipes" just so I could rate this great dish! It is pretty much fail proof! Thank you from one who is NOT a good cook, this easy recipe makes me look like I know what I'm doing. Thank-you!

I used a single thawed chicken breast.  I cooked it on high for 3 hours, then shredded the chicken and cooked it for another half hour or so.  It soaked up the rest of the sauce perfectly.  I then saved the chicken for sandwiches the next day and it was delicious!

This was awesome.  I had just enough liquid after cooking to make the bbq saucy not drippy.  I don't know how I managed that when others didn't, but it was great and everyone loved it.  Will definately make this again!

My huband and I really enjoyed this.  It was very simple and I prepared everything the night before.  We used a thicker BBQ sauce and I thought it the italian dressing gave it a nice kick.  The chicken was moist and it made a ton of sandwiches.  I will definitely use this again.

I made ths a long time ago and gave it a so so rating.  Tried it again for a potluck at work yesterday and it was a hit!  I think it really depends on the bbq sauce you choose.  I used sweet baby rays.  I did add a little minced garlic and liquid smoke.  People talked all day about how good it smelled cooking and everyone who tried it raved, several asked for the recipe.

This is a great recipe.  Making it for the office "Big Texas BBQ" lunch.  Made suggested changes by other reviewers.  Will make again with all the different Jack Daniels sauce flavors.  Thanks Zanne.

I love this recipe - especially that it calls for frozen chicken breasts!!  Anytime I make this meal, people ask for the recipe!  I've also started using the leftover chicken to make a bbq chicken pizza the next night for dinner.

AMAZING.  I didn't have Italian dressing, so I used Greek dressing with feta. I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and the results were amazing.  I put my oven on "Lo" Broil and toasted a couple of French rolls for about 2 minutes on each side.  Fill with a generous amount of the BBQ chicken (pulled with 2 forks in the crock pot...), serve with your favorite Mac & Cheese and you got yourself a meal to remember.

A foolproof summer meal.  I added onion like some of the other reviewers suggested and it turned out great.  My boyfriend and I never eat leftovers, and we had bbq chicken sandwiches for lunch for the next two days.  We will definitely throw this one together again.
UPDATE:  I made this again for my sons first b-day.  I needed a lot so I premixed the sauce into 6 batches and prepackages the chicken and distributed it to vaarious family members to put in their slowcookers.  I forgot to add the onions this time, but it was still delicious!  Everybody saidhow great it was.

I add cup of yellow onion, some garlic as well. I put 1/2 cup of onion for the first two hours in the slow cooker then the rest two hours later. I keep on adding bbq sauce as it cooks. I like to serve this on a wheat bun, really really good.

Perfect! I didn't have any Italian dressing so I made my own using olive oil, vinegar and Italian spices.  I cut the recipe in half since it was only my boyfriend and I and cooked it on the stove top in a large sautee pan on low for 1 1/2 hours.  I also made some baked sweet potatoes on the side. Great comfort food without the guilt! I will definitely do this again.

I just made this recipe for the first time and...OMG!!! I made the recipe exactly as stated, but took other reviewer's suggestions and used Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce, added half an onion and a little minced garlic.  I also shredded it once it was done, and put it back in to let it absorb some of the juices.  I put it on a (light white) hamburger roll w/ red onion, pickles, and served it w/ potato salad and corn on the cob!  Believe me when I say "this is heaven in a crock pot"!

I love this recipe!  It couldn't be more simple.  I needed a meal to feed a crown of out-of-town guests.  I used 6 large fresh chicken breasts (about 3 lbs.) and cooked it on low for 6 hours.  I then shredded the chicken with a fork (it was very tender).  I did not need to thicken this sauce.  All the sauce absorbed into the shredded chicken. I used Sweet Baby Rays Barbeque Sauce (the only one I use) and Kraft Robusto Italian Dressing.  I served it on large rolls.  We had enough for days.  I even froze some of it.  Thanks for the recipe!

this was great... my husband i loved that we could just throw it in the crock pot and continue on then a few hours later have a great tasting, warm and hearty dinner, not a boxed or frozen dinner like usual... and being newly married im not use to cooking for two, or cooking at all (we love them as sandwiches on toasted rolls)

Very easy.  Set it and forget it. Will definitely cook again.  Taste even better the next day.  The seasoning got a chance to set in.

This was great! Served on wheat buns with sweet potato fries and corn on the cob. It was a hit at our house! Then used the leftovers to make BBQ chicken pizza which was awesome! Thanks!

Simple & sooo delicious!  I actually did use a cheaper BBQ sauce that I had on hand & it worked fine. My younger kids liked it on buttered, browned rolls & the older kids liked it with the baked potato. The chicken I used wasn't fully thawed & I think that made the end result a little watery but the chicken was so tender & flavorful that it didn't seem to bother anyone.  We will definitely be making this one of our favs!

I thought this was great!  So easy and yummy.  I have to agree with others though- make sure you use a quality BBQ sauce, and one that fits your tastes (sweet, spicy, etc)!

This was great, we ate every bite. I used half the amount of sugar, bulls eye Bold Original bbq sauce and fresh skinless bone in chicken thighs instead of the frozen chicken breast. I also didnt shred the chicken but just left it on the bone. Served garlic mashed potatoes and corn on the cob on the side. Perfect dinner.

This stuff is seriously good.  My husband says it's in his top 5 favortie recipes!  After I shredded the chicken I made Pizza Dough 1 (on this site), spread the chicken over the dough, added green onions, cilantro (bacon optional) and some cheese and baked.  This recipe made 2 large BBQ Chicken Pizzas. Very tasty.  If Sweet Baby Rays sauce is avalible in your area, it's worth using!

We really liked this recipe. I used baby ray's bbq sauce and it was perfect. After it cooked for about 6 hours I shredded the chicken and added more bbq sauce and cooked for another hour or so while I was baking the potatoes. Some shredded cheese and sour cream on top and it was very good. Thanks for sharing!

Excellent and easy . . . especially in the crock pot.  I used Cattleman's BBQ sauce, and I shredded the chicken breast 1 hour before it was done cooking, then placed the shredded chicken back in the crock pot for 1 more hour.  Everyone loved it.

This review is from my husband and 4 year old son as I don't eat meat :)  They went crazy for it! I only made 2 chicken breasts and scaled down the sauce...Next time I will make all the sauce it calls for because i had to keep adding water to keep it from burning. But anyway...It smelled CRAZY good and when I took it out of the crock pot it just fell apart! I also made this last week with my cast iron pan because I forgot to start it earlier - the only thing I changed was I used fresh chicken not frozen and didn't cook it as long. Thanks!

Couldn't be easier!  I didn't have Italian dressing on hand so I used Balsamic Vinegarette.  I still prefer to make my own bbq sauce, but this came together so quickly, sometimes that's more important.

This was pretty good. My husband really enjoyed it. I would not recommend using a crock pot on the low setting for more than 6 hours though. Only use the high setting for a shorter duration. Any longer and the chicken get REALLY dry. I may try this recipe again someday.

Amazing!! We loved this on top of BBQ Baked Potatoes and as BBQ Chicken Sandwiches for leftovers.  The flavor gets even better the next day.  I shredded my chicken about an hour before I was going to serve it and the extra liquid was absorbed perfectly. We will definitely be making this again and again!!!

I had enough time to cook only on high, I think low would have been a bit better.  If you use "Sweet Baby Ray's Barbeque Sauce" you should cut down on the brown sugar! I had to use soy sauce as I did not have the Worchestire  sauce (sp), and I threw in some of the oil and vinegar dressing I had, as I had no Italian per se. Barbeque recipes are very forgiving.  I did shred the chicken, a good idea, and was glad I had put a specialized plastic bag in the crock pot so the sauce did not burn on.  Served over baked potatoes was delicious. With small chicken breasts, only about 4 - 5 ounces each, it makes enough for about 4 people.  This could be doubled in a large slow cooker, I imagine, for a party.

It was pretty easy to make. I thought it was very good...but not amazing like I was hoping. I made it for a larger crowd, so I increased the amounts. It was watery at the end but the chicken was tender and everyone said it was good. it is def an easy recipe when making food for a crowd!

The sauce in mine was really thin but I shredded it and put it back to cook for 30 more minutes, and the shredded chicken absorbed the excess moisture so it was the perfect consistency. I added a chopped onion.

This was absolutely AWESOME! I used Jack Daniels Hickory Honey BBQ sauce. I thought shredding it would be difficult, but I just put a chunk of cooked chicken on a cutting board and used a fork in each hand to pull it apart. My husband likes onions, so I added a 1/3 cup chopped onion about 45 minutes before we ate. Served over potatos with cheese and onion, topped with sour cream. I cant wait to try this on hoagie rolls, or hamburger buns. Mmmmm MMMM Awesome!! (and so easy)

This was super easy and the results were simply wonderful. The dressing through me for a loop but when i took my first bite I was blown away. Next time I will use a better brand of BBQ but the results were still good. I know it's good when my husband raves about it. This recipe is a keeper!

This is delicious! Instead of combining all ingredients, I sprinkled my chicken with garlic salt and cooked 3 1/2 hours in 3/4 cup of cooking wine (very tender). Then I shredded my chicken and mixed with the remaining ingredients, cooking on low for 1 hour. Served on whole wheat buns with potato salad and baked beans. This is an excellent, budget-friendly recipe for casual company or entertaining kids.

This was very good.  I wasn't expecting it to be so tender but it was.  I put mine in frozen and it was done in a little under 4 hours.  I won't add as much brown sugar next time, I guess my BBQ sauce was sweet enough.  Good and easy recipe!

Very, very tasty chicken!!! I used frozen chicken breast and after about 2 hours of cooking I sliced the breasts in half to make sure they were cooked through. When it was ready I shredded the chicken and poured the juice over it. Will definitely keep this one!

We really enjoyed this.  I have made twice, once over baked potatoes and once as sandwiches.  We use Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce, it's the best.  The sauce does look very thin after cooking but I shred the chicken during last 30 minutes of cook time and it soaks up all the sauce.  We will make this often.

I actually made this sauce once due to not enough bbq sauce to cover the amount of wings i was using in my slow cooker.  So i threw in italian dressing, Worcestershire sauce, and instead of brown sugar i used honey.  then i mixed with asian veggies and put over rice :) I thought it was gonna be horrible but it was worth the risk! mmmm mmm goood

Very good, but heres a tip if you are making it ahead of time.  Cook it 7 hours, then when time to heat, you can either cook for 30 minutes in the crockpot or microwave it for a while. (not exactly sure about timing) Also: DOUBLE THE SAUCE RECIPE! this way, reheating it won't make it evaporate.  Good Luck! This is a delicious recipe.  Oh yeah, and a good barbecue sauce is Montgomery inn.  Also, if you like it sweet, add an extra 1/8 cup or so brown sugar.

i made this and it was very easy and good. I only used 3 chicken breasts since it is just me and the DH. Otherwise it would have been bbq chicken for a week and a half! :) very easy and a good change from bbq pork :)

I defrosted some boneless chicken breasts (thought there were 3 or 4 halves in the pkg but there were only 2) and put them in the slow cooker, reducing the recipe since it calls for 6 halves.  The house filled with an absolutely wonderful aroma.  I used KC Masterpiece Original BBQ sauce and homemade Italian dressing.  After a few hours on high I turned the cooker to low and let them sit until all were home for dinner.  Taking someone else's advice I shredded/chopped up the chicken in the cooker about 30 mins before serving and let it absorb the sauce. Served on bread, it was divine.  The family could not get enough, I wish there were leftovers for today.

I did it exactly to the recipe - 5 hours on low, shredding chicken at 3 hrs.  I used one entire bag (2 lb) of Publix frozen chicken tenderloins.  With that (880 cal) and 70 cal per tbsp. BBQ sauce (I used Sweet Baby Ray's), it ends up right at 2000 calories.  Add potatoes (160 per medium) or buns, and you've got a nice meal for the 3 of us with leftovers!  Loved it.  Thank you, Zanne! :-)

Very big time savor.  I did find that the chicken needed to be stirred every so often to keep it from getting a "burnt" taste...even on low setting.  Oh, and make extra sauce.  Otherwise, good oveall recipe.

Great flavor. Cooked on high for 3 hours, and pulled the chicken apart during the last 20 or so minutes. Served on top the potatoes with some extra sauce from the pot. Delicious!

Super easy and tasty.  I used Jack Daniels smokehouse BBQ, and I stirred in about half a packet of dry Italian dressing mix rather than a bottled dressing.

The sauce was very good, but the chicken was slightly dry and I cooked it less time than required!  I would make it again, but it definitely won't go in my rotation.

simple recipe and ingredients.  i cooked 2 large, frozen chicken breasts for 5 hours on low and it was way too long.  probably should have done 4 hours max.  the chicken was pretty dry.  i think it's a good idea to shred it and stick it back in the sauce for a half an hour before the end of cooking time.  the sauce is very good on baked potatoes. thanks!

We added liquid smoke, garlic and onion and that was excellent!  Cooked a little over 3 hours on high from non-frozen chicken breast, shreded about 30 minutes before end of cooking.

Very easy, very good.  I used Big Al's KC BBQ Sauce which I had made.  I shredded the chicken and it was really good on fresh buns.  I did add a little more BBQ Sauce when we reheated the leftovers.

I make it every Friday and it comes out beautifully.It tastes better if you cook it over low heat for some time and also make sure that if you are using unfrozen chicken to control for too much liquid.

Easy and delicious!  With about 30 minutes remaining I shredded the chicken and added an extra splash of BBQ sauce. Very tasty.

I make this all the time - just put everything in the crock pot before you go to work.  When you come home, shred it and serve as sandwiches.

Fabulous!!!  So easy and yummy!  I used 5 large breasts because I was feeding 4 adults and 1 child that eats a lot.  I used Kraft BBQ sauce and I thought it taste good.  I did shred the chicken for the last hour which i think helped get the sauce on all the pieces of meat.  This is the best recipe I've made in a long time and I will make it again!

I just made the dish today while at home and it turned out to be great.  I felt at first the barbeque looked kind of watery when adding the italian dressing.  So during cooking I added a half bottle of honey bbq sauce.  And also I added honey to it since I was using honey bbq as the sauce.  Turned out to be a great dish.  Put it on top of brown rice.  Would definitely cook again.

After rubbing with Sea Salt, Fresh Ground Pepper, and Fresh Ground Garlic flakes, I cooked 2-3 pound fresh turkey breasts with the recipe as shown with the addition of one chopped sweet onion.  I shredded the turkey after cooking for 4 hours on high, and the amount of sauce is perfect.  The  flavor is unbelievable!

This sauce is great and very versatile. I used frozen meatballs instead of chicken and served the meatballs and sauce over white rice.  A fast and tasty meal that my whole family loved.

Not bad, unlike others, used the cheapo bbq sauce and Italian dressing I had on hand, and it was quite tasty...  Will try again with other varieties of sauce and dressings.  Will also cut back on sugar next time... Maybe substitute honey?

Made this over Memorial Day weekend and it was excellent! A definite hit with adults and kids alike and incredibly easy. I used Famous Dave's original BBQ sauce, added a tsp of liquid smoke and cooked on low for about 6 hours. Then I pulled chicken and let it cook for another hour or so. Perfect for sandwiches and terrific leftovers as well!

Love it!!  I have made this so many times, and every time I do it gets rave reviews.  I always add in an onion and about four garlic cloves.  Another nice addition is red pepper cut into medium-sized pieces.  Just don't forget the brown sugar!  This is definitely one of my favorites :)

The frozen chicken cooked perfectly in the crock pot and the amount of sauce was just right. Also helped to add an onion. But, I'm just not sure I liked the Italian dressing. It tastes like... you just put Italian dressing on bbq chicken. Maybe certain dressings are better for this. I guess I should have paid attention to the name "Zesty". This is goood for what it is and I'm sure some people's taste buds love it, but next time I will try another recipe when I am craving bbq chicken sandwhiches.

This was incredibly easy and made the best pulled chicken sandwiches. As someone mentioned, I used a better-quality barbecue sauce: Sweet Baby Rays.

This was so good and easy.  I made the recipe exactly the same except I added some Montreal Chicken Seasoning.  I shredded the chicken and made garlic mashed potatoes and baked beans with it.  It was the best meal I've had in a long time.

It was definitely better the second day.  I defrosted my frozen chicken breasts for about 10 minutes.  I cooked the chicken with one can of chicken broth until I could shred the chicken.  I then drained, shredded, and added the bbq mixture (used sweet baby rays) along with some onion and green pepper.  I did not add brown sugar...the bbq is sweet enough so I thought brown sugar would be over the top.  I would make it again...my dh who loves bbq chicken said it was ok the first day but definitely better the second!

I have made this several times already.  This could not be simpler and it is delicious!  I like to use K.C. Masterpiece Hickory & Brown Sugar BBQ sauce or Sweet Baby Rays in the sauce.  I have a newer slow cooker and 6 hours in my crockpot is plenty otherwise it gets too dry.  Leftovers make great BBQ chicken pizza.

Great recipe, but making this made me realize that I prefer BBQ beef over BBQ chicken. It seems to absorb the sauce better somehow.

This was SO GOOD!! I used 3 frozen boneless skinless chicken breasts. I cooked them on high for 4 hrs. I was worried they would come out tough, but they were so tender you could cut them with a fork. After 4 hours I took them out and shredded them and then added them back to the sauce and cooked it for a little bit longer. I used the BBQ sauce Big Al's K.C. Bar-B-Q Sauce from this site. I didn't add the brown sugar b/c the bbq sauce was sweet enough. It was awesome! We ate it on bread. I served it with potato salad and baked beans. We have plenty for left overs and I can't wait for lunch tomorrow! This will def. be a regular in our rotation!

Tasted good, it took an extra two hours than the time it says it takes to cook. It wasnt exactly what I expected, but it was a good quick lunch for a few days.

10 stars!!!  This was so good and so easy.  I used K.C. Masterpiece Honey BBQ sauce and followed the recipes exactly.  I made bbq sandwiches and had cole slaw with them and wanted more today, but we ate it all last night!  Will definitely be adding to our rotation.  I am pretty sure this will freeze well also.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Loved it except I found it really oily and I know that's from the dressing so I might try to use something that will give me the "zestyness" and no oil.  I also didn't use brown sugar because I agree with others who also used Sweet Baby Rays...it doesn't really need more sweetness. But thanks for the great idea!!

This turned out pretty good but remember it's only as good as the BBQ sauce you use.  We used Kraft Hickory Smoked because it was on sale.  Next time I think we'll use a different sauce.  I cooked it on high for 2 hours and low for 3 or 4 hours and it was tender.  I've never had an easier time shredding anything!  We served ours over baked potatoes with broccoli on the side.  Yum!

Easy to put together with only 5 ingredients. We have made this three times now. It's very kid friend and easy for young cooks to make.

A great recipe with very little "fuss" required.  I used Lite Italian dressing to reduce calories and fat and reduced the brown sugar to 1 TB.  Substitutions worked well!

Very, very good!  I used KC Masterpiece Sauce and Berensteins Cheese Fantastico Italian.  Served it on toasted sun-dried tomato rolls with sliced tomatoes, chopped romaine and pepperoncini's. Really a hit!  As pictured, shredding after a few hours takes care of the soupiness.  I added thinly sliced onions only because we love 'em in this sort of recipe, but would still be great without them if you're not an onion lover.  Easy and really tasty.  Will definitely do this again (and again...)

I loved this recipe, I used fresh chicken instead of frozen, and I did shread the chicken about an hour before serving. We have eaten it on sandwiches, pizza, and potatoes. I really like the versatility, makes the leftovers disappear.

This chicken turned out sooo good! I made this recipe in the crockpot. Defrosted the chicken first, added onions and garlic, and only 1/2 cup barbecue sauce. Instead of salad dressing I used 1/4 cup tomato sauce and a dash of liquid smoke flavoring.

I made this for dinner tonight and served it on Kaiser rolls.  It smelled and looked great but was WAY too sweet for us. I thawed the breasts and cooked them in chicken broth on high for 3 hours, drained the broth, shredded the chicken and then put it back in with the rest of the ingredients (plus some onion, bell pepper and garlic).  Very easy.  I will try again without any brown sugar.  We were really disappointed with the sweetness - it smelled so good!

I really liked this, I cut back a little on the italian dressing, but it was a really good flavour. I served it over thick cut fresh made granary bread with shredded cheddar cheese and sour cream on top. Yummy!

It's funny how things work out sometimes. I made this primarily for my husband who usually loves anything with barbecue sauce. He thought this was too sweet even though I reduced the brown sugar to 2T. My daughter and I on the other hand loved it. I served it with baked potatoes as suggested and green beans. Hubby is outvoted, we'll definitely be having this again. Many Thanks.

Amazingly easy and incredibly delicous.  I just threw in some frozen chicken and the ingredients and it turned out perfect.  I have made this twice and it was a success both times.  This recipe is a keeper.

This was pretty good. I used Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce and served over mashed potatoes. I shredded the meat and threw it back in the pot for 15-20 mins. The sauce wasn't thick, but enough so that it stuck to the meat...

YUM!!!  That's about all we could say while eating!  I followed another review and cooked the chicken in the c/p with water.  After a few hours, drained, shredded and added the remaining ingredients with almost a full bottle of Sweet Baby Ray BBQ sauce.  Served on toasted buns.  Yum, Yum, Yum!!!  Thanks for sharing such a great AND easy recipe!

I made these for my baby shower and everyone loved them. I am going to make these again. I did use fresh chicken instead of frozen just because I was worried that they wouldn't be done in time to eat.

The taste is great even though I forgot to add the worcestershire sauce... we let it rest for a half hour and the sauce never really thickened- it was a watery consistency. We all loved this recipe and will use again- but I'll thicken next time for sure.

Great recipe.  I used a previous reviewers suggestion and cooked in chicken broth for 3 hours on low, shredded chicken then added other ingredients and cooked on low for another 3 hours.  Husband and Kids loved it on rice with stirfry vegetables.  Both suggested next time we'll try it on mashed potatoes or in a tortilla with sour cream.  Only four stars because of the change.

This is a great, easy recipe that tastes wonderful and includes things I usually have on hand.  I am always happy to use the slow cooker to come home to something just about ready to go!  I used split chicken breast so I had take the skin and bone off, but it turned our really tasty.  Thank you for a great idea!

Very good, and very easy.  I was skeptical about the italian dressing, but it ended up being great.  I made this with chicken the first time and pork the second.  Both were great!

I made this for my husband, sister and father and I... it was a smash hit all around! Even my Dad who is a man of few words said that this was awesome BBQ! I used the Jack Daniels regular BBQ aka #7, and Tuscan House Italian Dressing... phenominal! The only thing it, I thought it was ever so slightly on the "sweeter" side, I might use less brown sugar in the future! However I am so glad to have this recipe! Made dinner for 4 plus great leftovers! And we are hearty eaters!  Thanks again!

Excellent!  I cooked on low for 3 hrs, shredded and cooked on low for an additional hour.  My 2 year old couldn't get enough.  We are having leftovers on buns tonight.

This was great! I added 1 tsp of liquid smoke because I like the flavor. I got compliments from family and co-workers. Even my picky kids loved it. Definitely in the rotation.

This is still cooking and already it tastes GREAT!!! The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because I made some changes...I did as one viewer said and cooked the chicken in 1 cup chicken broth, some garlic powder, and salt and pepper on high for 4 hours. I also added some chopped onion and a little bit of jalepeno juice to give it a kick. I shredded the chicken and drained most of the fat, and then added the bbq sauce/dressing mixture (which sounded so weird) and am cooking it for 2 more hrs. on low. The house smells wonderful! I will be serving this over baked potatoes!

Not bad, not great.  Didn't have a lot of flavor. If I did make it again I'd have to add lots of seasonings. It is easy, just boring.

This recipe was good except my chicken was a little dry (though, that was probably my fault) & it didn't make as much sauce As I would have liked. Next time I'll double it.

This is a favorite at our house.  I cook the chicken for about 4 hours on high in chicken broth.  Then I drain, shred, and add with the rest of the stuff back in the crock.  Cook on low for about another hour. Yummy!  I use the original Open Pit BBQ sauce, and a zesty italian dressing.  Perfect blend of sweet and spice.

Outstanding! I don't add the brown sugar because I like my BBQ a little more spicy than sweet.  I do add about 2 Tbsp of A1 sauce.  The sauce I use is a local favorite and it's a thin sauce, not super thick like KC Masterpiece.  It is perfect! I've made this for many gatherings and everyone always loves it!

This was too sweet for my boyfriend and I.  The idea was good for sandwiches, but if I do try this again I will make a more savory or spicy bbq sauce and leave out the brown sugar.

I threw this together in five minutes and served it over baked potato (like pictured) the first night...rave reviews from the super picky family.  THen the second night I fried up some red peppers and onions and put it all together on pizza crusts with a handful of mozza and it was gourmet pizza (got this suggestion from a previous review).  I can't believe how great these two dinner were from this one easy recipe.  I am taking this to a recipe swap...I will definitely make again and again...

The chicken breast pretty much just fell apart they were so tender.  They were very easy to make.  I usually pretty weird about cooking chicken, making sure it is fully cooked but not with this recipe.  The first time I made it was when we were having a yard sale and every time I would go inside to check on it the smell would drift out and our customers asked what I was making!

I liked this alright.  Definitely too rich/tangy to eat on its own but tasty enough as a topping for baked potato.  My favorite way to eat this though, is shredded on a pizza crust with red onion, smoked gouda, and mozzarella!  It makes a GREAT BBQ chicken pizza!

This was really good.  I think the next time I make it I will also cut back on the brown sugar, as I used a sweet BBQ sauce as well, as other reviewers have suggested.  We are going to enjoy the leftovers on a salad later this week. This is super easy since I didn't need to thaw the chicken first (I had no problem with the sauce consistency).

I absolutely love this recipe.  I cooked the chicken on low for 8 hours and after 7 hours I shredded it and returned it to the slow cooker.  I found that the sauce seemed thin prior to shredding but as soon as I returned it to the pot it soaked up the sauce.  I added a baked potato and green beans and was happy with the overall meal.  My fiance gave this recipe two thumbs up.  Also makes the kitchen smell GREAT!

This was very tasty, and super easy. The chicken was a little dry when cooking according to recipe directions. I will make it again, but decrease the cooking time a bit.

I left my chicken cooking for a little too long, so it was kind of dry. However, the taste was delicious. Had I not left it on for so long, it would have been perfect. I served it with a baked potato but my brother suggests rice instead; so this recipe is definately a keeper and with plenty of room to experiment.

This was great!  I took the chicken out and shredded it, then added it back to the sauce.  Hubby thought it was too "liquidy" but I thought it was perfect - we solved that disagreement by giving him a slotted spoon when serving himself.  I wouldn't change the recipe at all (a rare occurrence!).  :)

This chicken falls apart!  I used bullseye bbq sauce and wishbone italian dressing and it turned out amazing.  I left it in the slow cooker on high for a little over 4 hours and it still was moist and delcious.

I wanted to try this recipe because it seemed so tasty and easy!  It WAS!  My husband and I both agree on two things. It was the best bbq chicken we're ever had and #2.  We would probably try putting it on rolls next time instead of the baked potato.  It was yummy, don't get me wrong, but the chicken is so good on it's own!  I didn't have any bbq sauce so I used another allrecipe recipe, Daves BBQ sauce and it was terrific!  We will definitely be making this many times in the future.  
I used frozen chicken breasts, and cooked on low for 7 hours.  The chicken was so easy to shred, too!

We did not much care for this recipe! My husband said it needed more BBQ flavor - so another bottle of BBQ would have done it! We didn't throw it away, but didn't look forward to the leftovers either!! I shredded the chicken and the sauce thickened up nicely. Used 3 Huge boneless, skinless chicken breasts! Will try again with more BBQ! Thanks!

this is a great recipe for company. Although like others, there is no need for the brown sugar. The BBQ sauce has all the sugar you need. Use good BBQ sauce and I add chicken broth (added after the rest of sauce - enough to cover breasts in pot) to make sure there is enough juice. Add back in pot after you shred it. It will look like there is too much juice, until you add shredded chicken back into pot to soak up the flavor and juice. Perfect!

I made this about a week ago and it made four meals (I am single).  The only advice I would give is to add less BBQ sauce. It did turn out a little liquidity, but that wasn't a huge deal. I did eventually take the chicken out and shred it. Put it back in for 20 minutes and it was a little better. Still, it was late, and I was hungry. If I had left the chicken in longer (after shredding it), there might have been less sauce. It was very good though. I picked up some silver dollar buns (aka turkey buns) and put the chicken on that to make it a sandwhich. I also added red potatoes and carrots to the recipe. I will definitely be making this again.

This recipe is great and easy.  The only thing i changed was that I used Sweet Baby Rays 18oz bottle of barbeque sauce.  It makes a great sandwich if you put a slice of ham on top of the chicken and then pepper jack cheese and put it under the broiler for a few seconds!

I've made this 4-5 times in the last few months.  A simple recipe, but really good.  I don't add all the BBQ sauce while cooking, because I find the end result is watery.  Once done, I pull out the cooked chicken and some of the juices, and drain off the excess.  Then I add in the rest of the sauce.

Here's how you can ruin a recipe by try improvising - I used chicken wingettes with skin on and bones in ~ I don't know what I was thinking! Left it on high for over six hours. Used Jack Daniels BBQ sauce & omitted all other ingredients except for some sliced onion and garlic thrown in. I thought maybe the JD would stand on its own. However, using chicken with skin on rendered too much fat. So I had to let it cool on paper towels and hand pulled out the skin and grizzle, the meat fell of the bones and was shredded. It looked like it might be saved but turned out more like chicken soup in barbecue sauce. Tried it over rice but the sauce was just too over powering. Next time I'll follow the recipe verbatim. Really not fair for me to rate this since I made a mess out of something as simply. So giving it 3*'s until my family lets me attempt to give it another go.

I was a bit nervous to try this because of the Italian dressing, but the reviews were great and now I see why!  This was awesome.  Followed exact recipe and wouldn't change a thing!

This was great.  I cooked the 6 chicken breasts on low for about 5-6 hours before shredding them and then adding the sauce and cooking a few more hours.  It actually could have used more sauce so next time I will add the whole 18 oz bottle of BBQ sauce.  KC hot and spicy was awesome.

I am making this right now for my husband's birthday as a surprise.  I followed some other reviewer's suggestions and slow-cooked my chicken for about 6 hours this morning in broth, drained, shredded, and returned to the crockpot and added the other ingredients.  In the middle of all this, I realized I don't have any Italian dressing, which is something I always have on hand!  In a panic, I came across the "Italian Dressing Mix" recipe on this website and whipped up a batch.  I didn't much care for it, but it's all I had so I added it to the bbq.  I was afraid to even taste it, but it is DELICIOUS!  Unbelievably easy and so wonderful, even with not-so-great dressing!  I know my bbq-lover will be impressed tonight!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Edited to add: ten years and six kids later I still make this delicious BBQ several times a year. I don't always "precook" my chicken either. It never fails to impress. The Italian dressing mix has also become a staple, I was wrong in my initial assessment - an overnight sit is all it needs for those flavors to meld and become a really great dressing. Still one of the hub's favorites and all my hardworking boys gobble this up.

This is great.  I've made it several times.  The key is to put some of the sauce on the shredded chicken when it's done.

This was good and easy! Next time I will add some onions though. I shredded the chicken and added some cornstarch about an hour before it was done. It was still a little runny, but the juices soaked in as it sat overnight, so the leftovers should be even better!

Very tasty, I'll make this again but maybe with slightly more liquid.  As is sat on "warm" I felt that the chicken got dryer than what I expected.  It's not the recipe's fault though, if I would have just eatten it when it was done it would have been perfect!

This was soooo yummy! My husband could not stop eating this and just couldnt get enough. The only changes i made was i used Zesty italian dressing and added some chopped onion and 2 gloves of garlic to the sauce, i also used half sweet bbq and half hickory bbq and i think the hickory added a nice touch and thats why my husband loved it so much .. I then served it with cheddar cheese and chopped green onions. What a hit! thanks so much.

My new favorite! It was so easy and SO yummy. Embarrassingly enough, I didn't have barbecue sauce or Italian dressing, so I sheepishly threw in some Arby's sauce packets,leftover dipping sauces from fast food places, and teriyaki basting sauce...and it turned out great!

I added 1 can of Guinness and a bag of frozen veggies (whatever I have in the freezer at the time).  Served over egg noodles = delicious!  FYI: I have been putting frozen, boneless, skinless chicken in my crockpot for years and me and my family are still alive - no need to thaw before throwing in the crockpot, I promise.

This was amazing!  My husband and I just bought our first slow cooker, and this was the first recipe I tried.  I cooked it tonight actually.  It was so incredible!  The flavors come together perfectly; they are very well balanced.  Perfect, absolutely perfect...and so simple to make!!  I highly recommend this!

WOW!  What a tasty EASY recipe.  My super picky son loves it!  I follow the recipe exactly (I do add cornstarch to thicken sauce).  My change comes in the end. When I pull out the chicken to shred, I add the cornstarch.  The big change is I add a can of Great Northern Beans when I add the shredded chicken back to the sauce.  I let it cook for anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour (or until I am ready to serve dinner). My other change is that I serve the chicken and beans over rice.  This is a super easy, super delicious meal.

Did not change anything about this recipe besides using fresh chicken breasts instead of frozen.  This was really yummy! Shredded the chicken and cooked for a half hour more, then put on a grilled roll with melted cheese. Sooo good!

Very good and very easy.  Wish I would have thrown in 3 or 4 more chicken breasts so that I'd have more left over (the recipe had plenty of sauce).  I shredded the chicken and then mixed it back in the sauce.

This is one of the best barbeque chicken recipes I have found.  I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and cooked my chicken on high for four hours, then removed it and shredded it.  I stirred in 2 tbs of flour to thicken it and added the shredded chicken back into the crock pot.  I cooked it on low for another hour, and it came out perfect.  Serve with sweet potato fries.

Really Good. Followed the recipe except I added some salt, pepper, Smoked Paprika (gives it a delicious smoky flavor), cumin, and some garlic powder. Cooked for 6 hours, shredded the chicken and for the last hour or so gave it a stir every now and then. Not the thickest barbecue sauce, but the potato I put it on sucked it up and was delicious.

Made it for a Tailgate and served as sandwiches.  Everyone loved it! Was a bit watery though- will probably thicken it up next time.

I followed this recipe exactly except for the time it was on due to my work schedule. (on low approx 10 hours) and I found that this was very dry. The flavor was good though. I pulled the chicken apart at the end of the meal and added some of the juice from the crockpot and this was not so bad. I may try again and follow the times better to see if this makes a difference.

Good overall flavor.  I shredded mine to make it a 'pulled chix sandwich' Next time I will leave the chicken breast whole and serve that way.  Good and tender chicken.

Great recipe.  I boiled my chicken separately first and used kitchen shears to shred the chicken.  I added original Jack Daniels BBQ sauce and the rest of the ingredients and let cook in the crock pot for an hour.  It was awesome!  I put it over a baked potato (didn't need butter) with sour cream and added a side salad.   Great meal!

I made this recipe with thawed chicken breast and the addition of 1/2 of a chopped onion and it was PERFECT. I am not a BBQ Chicken fan, but my husband so I figured I would make this to try it. I loved it! The sauce is amazing and it's so easy! Most of the stuff you already have in your fridge or pantry.

I made this last week for dinner, and was very happy with it. I had to leave out the brown sugar (I can't believe that I didn't have any!). I used the leftovers for Barbeque Chicken Pizza. Hubby and I really enjoyed the zip from the Italian dressing. I may even start using this for my slow cooker pulled pork.

I followed the recipe to a T.  I used Jack Daniel's original no.7 recipe barbeque sauce.  I used Ken's lite Italian dressing.  I love how easy this recipe is; it doesn't get any easier than throwing frozen chicken and a simple sauce mix in the slow cooker! I shredded the chicken and we put it on tortillas.  We're already thinking of all the ways we could use the leftovers. Thanks Zanne!

Left it on high for 4 hours, and the chicken is reeeally dry and the sauce seems greasy.  I'm taking it out to shred and mixing in only part of the orig sauce along w/some fresh bbq sauce...hope it gets better after it's had a chance to mingle in there...

One word YUMMY!!! Next time I may cut down on the brown sugar ONLY because my kids said it was too sweet(I should mention they are extremely picky eaters)My husband and I both ate seconds and then made sandwiches the next day with the leftovers. I used sweet baby rays bbq sauce and good seasons italian dressing made with balsamic vinegar. After cooking on low for about 4 1/2 hours I shredded the chicken and continued to cook for an additional 2 1/2 hours. At that point the sauce was nicely thickened and caramalized. I can't wait to make this again!Thanks for the recipe

Very good.  I didn't have all of the ingredients to make exactly as written. I don't care for the flavors of Italian dressing and barbecue sauce and left that out intentionally...plus adds fat and calories =) ...  Served with mashed potatoes and salad.

Super easy and the kids loved it!  I was leary of using frozen breasts but it came out just perfect.  Make sure to shred the chicken an hour before serving so it soaks up the juice.

I have made this several times and it is a HUGE hit with both my husband and my kids (which is sometimes pretty hard to do).  The only change I make is to use fresh chicken breasts.  I cook on low 5-6 hours, shred with a fork and serve on buns.  It is so easy and great tasting.

We LOVE this recipe!! I use Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce (we like the sweeter sauces). The left overs freeze really well for a quick meal at another time. This made a wonderful main dish for my son's first birthday party - I doubled the recipe and served it on whole wheat kaiser rolls for yummy, easy, sandwiches for a crowd. My husband gets excited and says "mmmmmmm...." if I mention it is on the menu for the week. Definitely a keeper!!

Wow!  This was really good.  I use Famous Daves Rich (or was it Bold?) and Sassy bbq sauce and the flavor was amazing.  I agree that you need a good sauce.  Will make again and again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I like this recipe because it's easy to keep the ingredients on hand and it's SO easy to make!  My husband and 2 year old loved it.  It can get a little sweet and even though I added cornstarch and shredded the chicken, mine has turned out pretty soupy both times I've made it, but it's delicious all the same.

I really liked this. I used Sweet Baby Ray's sweet and sassy.  It had the perfect bite and the family loved it.  I made extra and froze it for later after I shredded it up.  We ate the breasts whole and really enjoyed them.  Can't wait for the leftovers.

This was really good and super easy.  I thought that it was yummy.  Hubby didn't care for it.  I served it on baked potatoes with cheese and sour cream I think that he may have liked it if I had served it on a bun as a sandwich.

I was sick yesterday and the last thing I wanted to do was sit in front of a stove and cook while doing the daily battle of homework.  I decided to find something for the crockpot and this was terrific!!  My kids loved it, my wife loved it and I could lay on the couch and be miserable!  Tastes great and so so so so easy!!!!

This is a great recipe: easy, easy, easy, and so good. I used KC Masterpiece Original bbq sauce and fresh made-at-home Italian dressing (Good Seasons). My kids loved this served on buns. I highly recommend this recipe.

This was great! I used Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce and shredded the chicken about an hour before it was done. Served with baked potatoes and steamed veggies. Yummy!!

Very tasty, made this with KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce (regular) and it did make quite a bit of sauce. However, there is only 2 of us, we only ate 1/2 of it; will see if it is too much when the leftovers are shredded. Mashed potatoes and corn good accompaniments.

This recipe is AMAZING!!!  I only made one modifications by adding 1/2 a packet of onion soup/dip mix.  I made 3 large chicken breasts and cooked on low for 3 hours, shredded the chicken and returned to crockpot for an additional hour.  Excellent!!  Taste as good if not better than BBQ sandwiches i order from my fav restaurants.  (used wishbone italian dressing and Famous Daves Rich & Sassy BBQ).

Excellent. I added chopped red onions to the crockpot. I also made the potato (but really I liked the shredded chicken by itself). Served with sauteed vegetables! No leftovers.

I made this for company and they loved it.  They couldn't believe it was Italian dressing and BBQ Sauce.  I sweetened mine up a little bit more with extra brown sugar . . . we like sweet sauce.  I will definitely make this again.

The recipe is much better when you use pork instead of chicken.  At the end of the day I couldn't really tell that I was eating chicken at all.

My two sons wanted to know if they could rate this a BIG TEN BABY!!!!!!!  This is a homerun, a rare find, a WINNER.  I followed it exactly except for one thing.  I threw in boneless breasts and tenderloins because I didn't have enough chicken breasts.  I did exactly as written but when I came home from work I spooned out the chicken and set aside.  I quickly and easily strained the sauce in the crockpot, added to a saucepan, and brought to a boil.  I mixed about a tablespoon to a tablespoon and a half of cornstarch in a half cup of water.  I whisked it into the boiling bar-b-q "Gravy", and served over the pieces of chicken AND red skin mashed potatoes.  I chose not to shred the chicken, and Let me tell you MAKE THIS TODAY!!!  Thank you for one of the best recipes I have found here!

Excellent with Jack Daniels sauce (19 oz. bottle).  I added 12 oz. in the beginning, and the remaining about an hour before cooking was completed.  Also added 3 garlic cloves and 1/2 tsp. Cayenne.  Next time double the recipe and freeze the leftovers- this time the recipe went too fast!

This is very easy to prep and the ingredients are simple. I made it the day ahead and packed it for work lunches. I easily altered the recipe when I was out of Italian dresing by adding a little oil and vinegar with spices. A keeper for sure!!

This is a very easy and delicious recipe. I only made 3 fresh chicken breasts, adjusting the recipe as needed. Famous Dave's Rich and Sassy was my bbq sauce of choice (yummy!) I slow cooked the meal on high for the first half hour and then on low for 2 and a half hours. I took the meat out and shredded it. Then I put it back in the slow cooker for an additional hour on low. Once it was done, I added a little more bbq sauce to the mixture, since a lot of the liquid was soaked up after I shredded the meat. It turned out great! This is a must try!

I cooked mine on the stove top since my slow cooker was in use... but it stilled turned out really well!!  The chicken was tender and held the great BBQ flavor.  As an added bonus - the recipe was SUPER EASY!!  :)

My favorite kind of recipe- super quick!  My brother, his three kids, and I all thought this was really tasty.  At others' suggestion I used the Jack Daniel bbq sauce, a few dashes of Liquid Smoke, and a few shakes of Cayenne. The prep took less than five minutes.  I wouldn't say it is "the best" but will definitely make it again and again because it is a perfect combo of easy and tasty.  Thanks.

This is such a simple and delicious crockpot recipe with ingredients that most eveyone has on hand.  I used Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce because it's my favorite anyway. I also added 1/2 tsp. each onion and garlic powders.  I cooked the frozen chicken breasts for 5 hours in the crock pot on low.  I couldn't believe how tender the chicken was.  My son ate 2 servings and my grandaughters cleaned their plates!!
I'll make this recipe again but next time, I'll try shredding the chicken for sandwiches.  Excellent recipe!!!

I love how simple this is to prepare.  I did defrost the chicken breasts a bit beforehand, and when I make things for the slow cooker I tend to prepare it the night before, pop it in the fridge, then put in the slow cooker.  So my chicken was probably mostly defrosted by the time it went in.  I kept it on low all day and when it came time to eat, shredded it and served on buns.  Bf really liked it; I thought it was okay, but I am not the biggest fan of bbq sauce anyway.  It's definitely something I'll make again bc it is so easy and a great quick meal for weekdays.  Thanks!

This is a great recipe! I had to cook my chick on HIGH due to time but it still turned out excellent. I shredded my chicken after it had been in the crockpot for about 2 1/2 hours which worked perfectly. I'll be making this recipe again!

This was very good...not quite a five star recipe but that probably has to do with the quality of BBQ sauce I used and not the recipe itself. I used dry salad mix instead of dressing. It cooked on high for about three hours, then I shredded it and put it back in for another half an hour, then served it on toasted hamburger buns. My husband loved it!

This one gets 4 stars because my husband really liked it but I thought it was just ok. As suggested, I used the Jack Daniels bbq sauce. I will make this again since he liked it so much but will try another brand of bbq sauce.

Tried this last week-end...delicious and easy.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's sauce and also put the chicken breasts in the microwave on defrost for a minute or so.  I shredded it and served it on buns with bread and butter pickles.  I am making this for a back to school lunch for my staff when school starts next week.

We too had the watery problem. I cooked for awhile with the lid off and added some cornstarch and that helped a little. My husband loved the flavor, I thought it was so-so. We'll tweak the recipe and try again.

All I can say is WOW!  This was so easy and so good!  Even my picky 3 year old ate this up without complaint.  It tasted as good as the local BBQ joint.  I used Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce and a homemade italian dressing as I was out of store bought.  Thanks so much for sharing!

This turned out great.  Thought the italian dressing was going to add a strange touch, but it was great.  I did season the chicken with a little garlic salt first.  Also added some diced onions to the sauce.  Husband and I both liked this one very much!

WOW! I used Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory and Brown Sugar BBQ Sauce, shredded the chicken after 6 hours (on low) and let it soak up the sauce for the last 45 minutes. Served on a warm bun with cole-slaw and watermelon. YUM! Does anyone have anymore recipes this easy/this good?

This was pretty good! With fresh chicken breasts I cooked it on low for 4 hours and the chicken shredded easily.  Like another reviewer I added some Wondra flour to thicken the sauce a little just before serving on toasted rolls. Yummy!

Very easy and delicious! Added 1/2 an onion and 2 garlic cloves. As advised by another reviewer, I used chicken breasts WITH THE BONE but removed the skin. Used Famous Daves Rich & Sassy original and Trader Joe's Italian dressing. Had on rolls with corn on the cob and slaw. Can't wait to make again and experiment with different sauces. I did not have the thin sauce problem. I think it is important to start with a thick sauce.

I thought this recipe was okay, I think it could have use a little seasoning.  Don't get me wrong it was good, but needed more flavor.  If I do make this again I will add garlic salt, pepper and onions!

This was just ok.  I used my favorite *homemade* BBQ sauce and winced when I added the dressing, sugar, and w. sauce. It watered down and changed the flavor of a perfectly good BBQ sauce! So many of the reviews say "use a good sauce", but let me also add to definitely use a bottled sauce that might need some extra "zest", like the italian dressing, sugar, and w. sauce.  The chicken was moist, it wasn't too runny after I shredded it, and I added more BBQ sauce at the end - it needed it to make up for the watered down tasting sauce it cooked in.  I might make this again in a pinch, with a bottled sauce.

This had a really good flavor, and even the kids gobbled it up.  I only gave it 4 stars because it was too runny.  Some suggested that once you shred the chicken and add it back the crock that it wouldn't end up watery, but mine did not.  Serving with a slotted spoon worked out pretty well.

Good stuff. I followed the recipe to the T used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce. After cooking all day the sauce lost a bit of punch and my chicken dried out. No doubt my mistake (can't ever keep chicken from drying out in the slow cooker) But I added sauce from the slow cooker after pulling the chicken apart then added some sauce from the bottle on top. This is good stuff. Will be keeping this recipe thanks.

Made this tonight using left over Roast Sticky Chicken Rotisserie Style on Buttery Rolls from this site. YUMMY! I added minced garlic and onion and it took these modifications beautifully! Thanks for an easy, tasty recipe! Will be using this for my leftovers more often!

Awesome! I had 3 already thawed chicken breasts, so I adjusted the ingredient amounts and they were just right. Also since my chicken was already thawed and I was short of time, I set my crockpot on HI and cooked them for 2 hours. They were perfectly cooked, took them out shredded them with 2 forks, put it back in and served it on mini Kaiser rolls. YUM. I brought the leftovers to work today and everyone loved them! Thanks!

Added 1/2 an onion, minced, and 4 cloves garlic (2 tsp. of the bottled "fresh" crushed garlic).  I used Tony Roma's Carolina Honeys BBQ sauce.  AWESOME!  Both times I've made it I've served it shredded on rolls, but then with leftovers I've run out of rolls and ended up eating it plain (and licking the bowl) because it is so freakin' good.  It's super flavorful without being burn-your-mouth spicy (at least with the BBQ sauce I use).

Good, easy recipe. Great different way to make chicken. Tender enough to cut with a fork. My family loved it - will make again.

This was very good.  I didn't add as much of the sauce as it called for because I only had 4 chicken breasts.  And I did add some sliced onions.  It was tasty and easy.  Chicken in the crock pot is always soft/tender but never juicy.  If you are expecting it to be juicy, you may be disappointed.

This makes a great chicken and sauce. My family liked this but I wasn't too sure.  It tasted like bbq sauce mixed with italian dressing.  Nothing special. It's a good recipe if you're short of ingredients.  I did add garlic and a chopped onion. This needs veggies...might as well add them if the slow cooker is on cooking the chicken anyways!

The sauce in this recipe is to die for. I actually used bone in chicken drumlets instead of breasts & served it as a main meat dish instead of on a sandwich. Slow Cooker easy & Deeeeelicious!

This was great! I used Trader Joe's BBQ Sauce and Italian dressing and it had the perfect combination of spicy and sweet. I put in slow cooker on high for 3 hours, shredded chicken, then put back in for about 30 minutes. Great for work lunches!

The most delicious chicken our family has ever tasted!  No changes made.  Would recommend thin frozen chicken breasts just because they're easier to eat on a bun.

I really liked this one, but my kids didn't like it very much, so next time i will leave out the dressing, and just use the bbq sauce, the meat was really tender and juicy.

I thought this was OK. Very easy to make and serve but the flavor didn't wow me. Maybe I didn't use the right kind of barbeque sauce?

Good meal. Made it for my inlaws today and everyone enjoyed it. Added onion and garlic. Tried to boil off some of the liquid, but still felt it was a little runny. Next time will add in some cornstarch or flour toward the end of the cooking. Will cook again - nice, easy meal!

This was so very good, and love the idea I could use frozen chicken. I did take the chicken about two hours before done and shred it with a fork, then mixed it real well with the sauce and the turn out was so good on sandwich rolls. Leftovers heated in mirco were even better two days later.

Was very good - tangy and sweet!  I agree with other reviewers in that it really depends on the BBQ sauce you use.  If you get cheapo stuff, it will definitely have a different outcome.  Splurge a little.

GREAT RECIPE!!! I made this Chicken dish for a huge family BBQ yesterday, and it turned out delicious. Everyone raved about how good it was. It was so easy to make also, just throw it in the crock pot and leave it all day. WONDERFUL!!! The only change I made was I used bone in Chicken thighs and I tripled the recipe it I had to make it for so many people. Thanks for a great recipe!!

Wonderful and SOOO easy!  I tend to "modify" recipes, but I followed this one to the "T".  My husband thought it was too sweet, but I liked it just fine.  Next time I will try it with pork.

I really enjoyed this recipe, my brother even asked me for a copy he liked it so much.  I used chicken tenders and I think that caused it to dry out a little bit, or maybe i should have cooked it a little shorter since I was using smaller pieces.  But it was still wonderful!!!

Followed the recipe exactly.  Cooked on high for 4 hours. Found the chicken came out too dry if you plan on eating a whole breast. So I shredded it and stirred it back into the sauce. This way it was perfect! Wonderful flavor.  I use Sweet Baby Rays Original. Served it on toasted buns with potato salad to accommodate the meal.  A great summer dinner. My daughter and boyfriend loved it!!

I am a busy mom of 4 sons and admittedly not much of a cook. So, I tried the simplest version possible by trying several tips I read about. This is what I did: cooked chicken breasts in 1/2 cup of chicken broth in my slow cooker (for about 3 hours on high). Then, I shredded the cooked chicken and added Jack Daniels b-b-que sauce to the slow cooker and cooked for another 2 hours. The chicken was moist and tasted great! We put it on potato rolls and ate with rice and a green salad.

On the advice of another reviewer I bought "good sauce". It came in a 16 oz bottle so I essential 1 1/2 the recipe and used 5 whole chicken breasts. I think I could have used 6 or 7 breasts and still had plenty of sauce. I served the meat over hamburger buns...it was a hit. I may cut down a tad on the sugar next time though.

Fantastic flavor and was simple to put together. The chicken was incredibly tender and easy to shred. Made some corn and dinner was done!

This recipe was so yummy and super easy. I used 4 bone-in chicken breasts (didn't have boneless) that were thawed. I cooked on high the first hour and a half and then on low for about another 3 1/2-4 hours. It was fall-off-the-bone delicious! I also saved a little bit of the sauce to put on it to serve. I served  mine over rice ~ very yummy!

The flavor was great, but the resulting sauce was a bit thin. Next time I make the recipe I'll reduce the cooked sauce in a saucepan over the stovetop. I served the meal with brown rice, and dilled broccoli. Yummy!

Love this because its SOOOO easy. Shredded chicken for last hour or so. Thickened sauce with 2 T flour mixed with 2 T chicken stock (cut recipe in half). Served over rice. Would be great as sandwiches too. Next time will make more sauce!

Mine looked nothing like the picture.  I bought an expensive BBQ sauce as recommended by one review but my sauce was very runny and lacked flavor.  I shredded the chicken, added more BBQ sauce and made sandwiches.  It probably made about 12 to 15 sandwiches.

I rated the wrong recipe. This is the one I didn't find too great.  It sounded great to be able to put it in the crockpot, but it was too soupy, the flavor of the good barbecue sauce got lost in the soup like liquid on the chicken. I thought it was a waste of good barbecue sauce.

This is a great and easy chicken recipe. I did sprinkle some dried onion and "Garlic, Garlic" (from Tastefully Simple) on top of the chicken; then turned half way through. Very yummy!!

Absolutely wonderful! Super easy to put together, tastes delicious! Very tender. I cooked them on low heat for a total of about 7 hours. The only thing I did differently was I added more sauce (bbq/worchestershire/italian dressing) to the crock pot after shredding the breasts and realizing I would need more liquid. (I used Jack Daniel's Original No. 7 recipe.) I let the shredded chicken cook with the sauce a while longer... it was very tender and flavorful! Definite keeper!! I'm certain this would taste just as good with unshredded chicken!

the chicken was so tender and tastey even my husband (who ins't a big fan of chicken) loved it. i'll use less Italian dressing next time and a little more liquid smoke (i used 1 T) next time, but there will certainly be a next time.

very good! i used boneless skinless chicken breast, low calorie bbq sauce, light dressing and splenda brown sugar as well as another reviewer and it was delish. i cooked it on low for about 9 hours and the chicken was not done so i put it in the oven to finish. it came out sooo tender. i think my crockpot needs to be replaced as i've had it for 12 years and got alot of use out of it so, in order not to face the problem of uncooked food again, i threw it out, hey, no need to clean it!!! i'll just buy another one cause i'll be using this recipe again! thanks for sharing =:)

I made the recipe according to the directions...I cooked it on low for about 8 hours.  There was a distinct burnt taste to the sauce and the chicken was somewhat dry.

I give this 3 stars because it was so incredibly easy to make. It wasn't a "Wow" meal though. The chicken was dry and I cooked it on low and checked it often during the last couple of hours of cooking to make sure I did not over cook it. The 'sauce' was a little oily and had a weird flavor to it. I used Dave's BBQ sauce and name brand Italian dressing (I use these all the time and love the flavors of both) but the taste just didn't seem to really be that great. This is only something I will cook again if I have nothing else in my house to throw together. It will not be added to my dinner rotation.

I heated on high for about the first hour then on low for the next 7 hours. Last hour or so I thicken the sauce with some flour/fluid mixture. Was pretty good.  I used my favorite BBQ sauce from Germantown Commissary here in TN. The meat was very tender and "falling off the bone"...if it had bones. Oldest son enjoyed it but youngest did not, but he's not a huge bbq fan.

I was really surprised by this recipe. Halfway through the cooking I thought it was going to just taste like plain old bbq chicken which I'm not that fond of. This recipe was delicious and soooo easy to make.  I usually change things a little but I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect. I did shred it and put it on sandwiches.

First off, I am not a huge BBQ fan. One day, we had a potluck at work and a coworker brought this in as her contribution. I could not believe that I had finally found a BBQ dish that I actually liked so I decided then that this recipe was a keeper. I did not change a thing with the recipe. I made it exactly as written and it turned out wonderful. My husband, who loves BBQ, was iffy when he saw me putting Italian dressing in the crockpot, but was very pleased with end result. Will make again!

Great EASY recipe.  Like others, I used a fork to pull the chicken apart and then served it on sesame seed buns.  The chicken was very tender and had a great flavor.  Even my picky kids ate this one.

This is a great recipe! I've made it a lot.  I love to shred it and put it back in about an hour before it's done, then make a chicken salad with lettuce, this shredded chicken, black beans, corn, and tomatoes, mmmmm... Oh, and I use Famous Daves BBQ sauce.

This was really good. I had frozen chicken legs that I threw in the crockpot and added the sauce. It smelled great and got super tender. It did seem a lot like regular BBQ chicken in the crockpot, but it did have a little something more. Thanks for another way of making easy BBQ chicken!!

My husband would have rated this 5 stars, but my son and I weren't too crazy about it.  I'm not a big bbq sauce fan.  But my husband was thrilled with it, so I'm still glad I made it.  I served it with cornbread muffins!!

This recipe gets high ratings for being very easy to prepare. Love the fact that you can use frozen chicken breasts since I'm terrible about remembering to thaw things.  However, otherwise it was just okay.  Chicken was tender (must be careful to not over cook!) and fairly "zesty" just wasn't my most favorite recipe. May use it again though the next time I need a quick recipe and haven't thawed anything in time.  Perhaps I'll try a different flavored BBQ sauce, this time I used Bullseye Original.

I have made this several times now and it is very tasty. i've found it tastes better when I use high quality bbq sauce and Italian dressing. I always shred the chicken and let it sit in the sauce for about an hour before serving on rolls. Thanks for the recipe.

Made this over the weekend and we did enjoy it. Following the advice of others before me, I cooked the chicken breasts in chicken broth on high for 2 1/2 hours. At that point, I poured out the broth and added the b-bque sauce mixture. Let it cook on low for another 2 hours and it was okay. The chicken was very tender and juicy. I'm not sure it's any better than any bottle of barbeque sauce would ve though. Just not sure I'll make it again.

My Husband raved to his mother about this one! I used frozen boneless chicken breasts. I also used Ken's Italian dressing and Marinade (the best!). So easy... will be making again and again! Try with Chicken, pork or beef...

My one complaint about this was just that it was really sweet - not sure what to do to remedy that...maybe it's just me.  But it's a good recipe, and really easy.

I've had problems in the past with BBQ sauce in a crockpot for too long, so I started it in the morning with just the dressing and Worchestershire sauce, then added the BBQ sauce and sugar about 3 1/2 hours before I planned on serving it (mainly because I was leaving the house--otherwise I probably would have added it only an hour before. It turned out great anyway).

I made this for dinner and it turned out very good.  The only change I would make is to not let it cook as long - I think I overcooked it bc the sauce was really thick.  Otherwise, it was delicious.

This was a huge hit in my house.  I only had a generic BBQ sauce and it still turned out great.  I took the advice from others and pulled the chicken apart after 3 hours and let it cook for another hour after that.  It was perfect!!  We had it over rice and steamed veggies.  Wonderful, thankyou!!

I really didn't think this was anything to write home about.  My husband actually could not finish eating his the flavor was so bad he said.  We both thought it was dry & I will not be making this again.  Followed the recipe just as it said and did not make any alterations.

OMG!  Sooo good.  I have made this twice in the last week with different flavoured sauce both times (bullseye original and spicy chipotle) YUMMY.  I used bone-in chicken and added 2 cloves of fresh garlic, but otherwise perfect.  Mashed potatoes are the perfect side dish and the sauce is so good on them too.  MAGNIFIQUE.  Thanks.

My first rating on this recipe was only a 3 and was not planning on making it again. I was in a bind and needed something fast for the crock pot, so I tried this again. I have no idea what happenined the first time, because this time it was fabulous. May the brand of chicken makes a difference?

I reduced the recipe to four servings and used three chicken breasts and still got six servings. I found this recipe very easy to put together and very good. I used Jack Daniels bbq sauce and cooked it for less time than the recipe recommended. My husband wished it had been more spicy...maybe I'll try something to that effect next time.

It was excellent. I added minced garlic, bellpepper, onion and 2tbls of vinegar. We made sandwiches. My kids were hesitant to eat this (they are big on hamburgers) but were speechless after the first bite. Hubby also loved.

Easy to make and my daughter loves this one.  As others have stated, this recipe is based on a good BBQ Sauce--I use KC Masterpiece.

VERY TASTY!  I made this for my parents to eat when they got back from bowling league.  They devoured it!  My mom wasn't entirely sure what i was doing so she made rice and green beans and served the chicken over it instead of doing sandwiches, but both parents reported good things, which is rare!  This made the house smell delicious!  And, for the record, I used Kraft BBQ sauce and it was delectable!  I did use about a 1/4 more Italian dressing, but more on accident than anythign eles (the pour spout on the bottle came out, so maybe it was more than that!).  Anyway, I think I am going to serve bbq chicken sandwiches for super bowl! thanks.

I used a mustard based "South Carolina" style bbq sauce because that's my favorite.  I used 18oz. because that was the size of the bottle but followed the rest of the recipe.  I cooked it on low for 4 hours, shredded the chicken and returned it to the sauce, and cooked 2 more hours on low.  I used a little flour to thicken the sauce.  This was delicious with a nice little kick to it.  I will definitely make this again.

I got a crock pot for Xmas and this was the first recipe I tried.  I did as others suggested and added chicken broth (about 3/4 can), and added a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's Original BBQ sauce and it was delicious.  I can't wait to make it again, trying different sauces.  I can see how the BBQ sauce you use can make or break this dish.  Something cheap and too tangy might ruin it.  Next time I will try something a little smokier tasting, and use a TAD less Italian Dressing.  (I used less than the recipe called for and it was still a little too intense for me.)  All in all, this was a GREAT recipe.  My fiance LOVED it, and the two of us managed to finish the whole thing in just 2 days.  I HIGHLY recommend.  Thanks!

This was so good ! I took the suggestions of some of the other reviewers and cooked the whole breast and the last hour I took it out, shredded them, added some corn statch to thicken the sauce up a bit, then put the shredded chicken back it for another hour on low.  I then toasted the buns and cooked some fries... and omg was is yummy. I used Sweet Baby Ray BBQ sauce.  I will def make again, over and over, and I am sure the whole breast would be just as yummy !!!!

This was exellent. It was quick and easy. I served it with mashed potatoes, biscuits and popcorn salad. The BBQ sauce goes well over the mashed potatoes. My family dunked biscuits in the leftover BBQ sauce. I used honey brown sugar sauce but can see how changing the BBQ would alter the flavor. I can't wait to to try it with other flavors of BBQ sauce. Give this recpie a try. You won't be disappointed.

This turned out really good. When i make this again I will thicken the sauce with corn startch while it is still in the crockpot. It would make a great sauce to serve on top of rice with the chicken. My husband loved this, and i will make this again. It was quick and easy.

Delicious! I put the chicken in the crockpot with a can of chx broth, garlic powder, salt & pepper (as suggested by another reviewer) for 4 hours, then drained, shredded chix and added the rest of the ingredients, along with a little red pepper flakes. Served on toasted hoagie rolls - yummy!

Excellent! I used Famous Dave's BBQ sauce and added 1/2 an onion thinly sliced and it was awesome! Cooked three frozen breasts on high for about 4 hours, the chicken was perfect. Shredded the chicken and served on toasted buns. I will make this again soon!

Really good.  Like other people, I would have used a better BBQ sauce, and I'm sure it would have made the sauce better.  But totally easy to make.

I am giving this recipe 4 stars because my kids and my husband loved it.  I did not care for it, but I do not usually like barbecue chicken. I was hoping this would be different.  It is a good recipe and I will make it again.

This is is SO easy & good. The sauce may have been a little runny & could have thickened it, but it seems to thicken the next day.  I used Cookies Original BBQ sauce and only had Caesar Vinaigrette with Parmesan dressing.  It was such a tangy, flavorful BBQ chicken- it has become my favorite way to make chicken & I make extra because we like it the next day for lunch at work.

We didn't love this. It was easy enough but the chicken had TOO much of a bbq flavor and I hadn't even put all the bbq suggested. I would give it three stars but because I made some changes (left in crockpot for 8 hrs with chicken broth which someone had suggested, then added bbq, etc for the last hr) it wouldn't be right to knock because of my changes. 
Put the shredded chicken on rosemary dinner rolls that had been broiled and it was pretty good. Just couldn't put too much chicken or the bbq flavor would completely overpower.

There was nothing "wrong" with this recipe: We just found it to be nothing special.  The breast cook in a shorter time than stated (almost an hour faster).  The extra stuff added to the BBQ sauce didn't change the taste much b/c we started out w/ a great sauce.  This wasn't bad - simply ho-hum.

This was soooo good! I followed the advice of others and drained the sauce about 1 hour before serving and shredded the chicken, then added a fresh batch of sauce (but only about 1/2) and mixed together and cooked then left on warming for the last hour. It was so tender and delicious. Will definitely be making this again! I'm excited to try pork!

I tried this recipe twice.  The first time with frozen and the second thawed in chix broth.  The taste both times was fantastic, but the sauce was extremely watery both times.  I was hoping for a thicker sauce after it was all said and done.

I didn't like this sauce, but the chicken was falling off the bone after 8 hours on low. We used bone-in chicken thighs, thawed.

I thought this was ok. Asked my family what they thought and they said it tasted just like I threw bbq sauce in it. Sauce overpowered other ingredients.

Very good, especially if it's been cooking 8+ hours. Shredded the chicken like everyong else, and wanted to serve it with cole slaw on the sandwich but didn't have any. It's great leftover too.

really good on hoagies w/ baked fries.  cooked the chicken in broth first as suggested.  I did find that the sauce burnt.  anyone have a suggestion for that?  use a slow cooker bag for easier clean up.

Made again- LOVED it.  Just threw in thawed breasts and followed recipe this time.  very easy and tasty. burned the crock pot really badly though!

This recipe was awesome!  My husband loved it.  I used 1/2 Sweet Baby Ray's and 1/2 BBQ Boyz sauces (6 oz each).  I added a tablespoon of crushed garlic and sprayed my slow cooker with Pam before I started.  The sauce was a little thin, but worked well over the baked potatoes I made as a side dish.  Clean up was a breeze - the best my slow cooker has ever cleaned up.  Will definitely make again!

I used fresh chicken, and left it in a little longer then required. Completely falls apart, which is perfect as I'm using it in my chicken burritos. Did use BBQ sauce, next time I'm trying chicken BBQ sauce.

This was such an easy recipe to throw together.  Next time I'll use a different Italian dressing because it didn't seem that "zesty" to me.  It did make good shredded barbeque chicken sandwiches though.  I would definitely make it again.

It was okay, but hubby requested not repeating it. Maybe it would be better with different BBQ sauce as others suggested - or maybe it's a different style of BBQ than this Texas is used to eating.

My husband and I really liked this recipe.  We only used three frozen chicken breasts and cooked the chicken in broth.  I put garlic powder, salt and pepper on the chicken as stated before in a review.  After 2 1/2 hours on low, they were cooked and ready to shred.  I dumped the liquid and still made the full amount of sauce (we like extra sauce) and combined it with the chicken on low for 1 hour.  It was WONDERFUL.  We used Rudy's barbeque sauce (it's a TX bbq joint that sells it's own sauce...the original was quite spicy, so I'll probably use the Rudy's Sissy sauce next time).

Let me start out by saying that this was very tasty! I threw in 3 large chicken breast, let them cook all day on LOW, and then shredded them and served them in pita pockets. However... I am only giving this 4 stars because the sauce burned... either BBQ sauce is not meant to cook all day, or my crock pot is insanely strong because I had it on the lowest setting possible and the sauce burned all around the edges of the pot and on the bottom. Maybe the sauce itself was too thick, I'm not quite sure... but the recipe was very yummy and my husband and I both have left overs for work today. I'll try it again with a thinner sauce...

Great recipe. I used chicken breast strips (not frozen) and followed the cooking time.  The first time they came out terribly dry and was reluctant to try it again, but the sauce was divine. I didn't shred them the first time because I am not crazy about shredded chicken.  The second time I used fresh chicken breast strips and cooked on low for 4 hrs.  I checked them after 3hrs and they were moist and falling apart. So I shredded them and let them cook for the last hour.  I put them on toasted rolls. Everyone loved them. The came out wonderful!  Now I am a fan of shredded chicken!

This was absolutely fantastic and so easy!! The only change I will make next time is to make more sauce. I served this over rice and the rice soaked up alot of the sauce. We like our food saucy!! I used Cattlemens bbq sauce. The kids had even 2nds!!

I tried this recipe when it was too rainy to barbecue. I followed advice from the other comments and slow-cooked the chicken on high, alone with a can of chicken broth, then drained and shredded it. I added the sauce and placed it back in the slow cooker for another hour. I used Cattlemen's barbecue sauce, and it turned out great. The chicken was very tender, we served on toasted wheat buns, and it was just as good as barbecue from the grill.

Very good.  Just as described.  My kids loved it (which NEVER HAPPENS unless it's a hot dog or pizza).  I can't see how it ended up dry for anyone.  Our only complaint would be that it's rather bland ... not very zesty ... but a different bbq sauce might help that.

I just upped it to 5 stars b/c I've made it for 3 families who just had babies, and all of them LOVED it.

The sauce was great and I love anything this easy.  I put everything in the crock pot and 7 hours later, dinner was served.  I was very disappointed about how dry the chicken turned out.  At least the sauce was good so I drowned it!

My husband and I really loved this recipe! I used chicken drumsticks on the bone and once cooked pulled the meat and returned it back to the crockpot. I served the meat and sauce over cornbread, very yummy! (I did add some more ketchup and a little hot sauce.)Thanks :-D

Fantastic chicken!  I took advice, and added chicken brooth, and used good BBQ sauce.  It was excellent, but even better the next day.  Next time I will make it the day ahead and serve later, sitting in the fridge makes great.  My picky husband really liked it.

So easy and soooo good. I only used 3 chicken breast (boneless/skinless) and had way to much sauce, next time I will use 6 or more breast. We shredded the chicken and put back in the sauce to simmer, served it on buns and the flavor was great. The only thing missing was onion so I'll add that next time. Used Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce.

I really did not know what to think when I first read the ingredients.  I was wondering how well all of the flavors would blend together.  But it turned out great.  I used bone in chicken and removed the skin.  Once the chicken was falling off the bone, I shredded it.  This is a very tasty dish and I will make again.  Thanks for sharing:)

I've made this a few times now. A great recipe that equals what you'd buy insome restaurants. Be sure to use a GOOD bbq sauce. Makes all the difference. I double the sauce and shred, like other users, to use for sandwiches.

Like others, I decided to shred the chicken and leave it in the sauce to simmer for about 1/2 an hour.  It was delicious.  I served it on whole wheat rolls with shredded carrot coleslaw.  My son who doesn't really like chicken had 3 sandwiches!  I think it would be fabulous with fried onions and peppers to top off the sandwiches and maybe even cheese melted on top.

I used boneless skinless chicken thighs, light dressing, and slightly less bbq sauce.  It was excellent!

We followed all recipe ingredients as written w/ the exception of adding 
maple syrup instead of brown sugar (same amount).  We used lite Italian dressing. Since our chicken breasts weren’t frozen we followed the “high setting” cooking time but cooked the chicken on low. The sauce & chicken were very good – & the recipe is easy!

This was pretty good.  I only used 3 chicken breast and 1 tbs of worcestershire sauce.  I used thawed chicken on low for about 2.5 hours.  Then I shredded the chicken and placed it back in the slower cooker for about another 2 hours until we were ready to eat.

This recipe was so simple and very good. Hubby and I thought the meat itself was a little dry, but there was plenty of sauce to slather it in. Good flavor and great quick weeknight recipe.

This one had mixed reviews in my house. My 9 year old daughter, who loves bbq sauce hated it. My husband, who likes bbq sauce thought it was just okay. I hate bbq sauce but I loved this. I had 3 big plates because I know my family will not want this meal again. Based on my family's reviews I should give this 3 stars but I gave it 4 because this was one of the easist dinners I have ever made.

I haven't reviewed anything in a long time, but just had to for this one.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ and Wishbone Italian dressing.  I shredded mine for sandwiches and it was awesome!  Whole family loved it and was surprised at how fast 6 chicken breasts disappeared.  Thanks for sharing...great!

Excellent! As others suggested, I shredded the chicken and it mixed well with the sauce. I didn't make any changes in the ingredients. I used Sweet Baby Ray's for the sauce. It was a good balance between sweetness and spiciness. Before this, the only shredded meat BBQ sandwiches I made were with beef and pork; I'm glad I tried this one.

Mine turned out more like a soup with chicken breasts. It was really good I cut the chicken up at the end and served it as a rice bowl. I don't know how people got it to look like real bbq chicken.

Loved this recipe!  So easy.  I used Jack Daniels Original sauce and Wishbone Italian salad dressing.  I did shred the chicken periodically while cooking.  I just can't say enough.  This is a keeper!  Can't wait to try it on the hubby.

DELICIOUS!  My hubby raved!  Actually, if I had rated this the first night, I would probably have given 4 stars.  We served it with baked potatoes and it was definitely succulent and tasty, but somehow too strong... The second night we had leftovers and I was in a hurry so I mixed it with a ranch rice I'd made for a different meal.  Perfect!  The ranch dressing in the rice blended perfectly with the BBQ taste of the chicken!  I also agreed with other reviewers - the kind of BBQ sauce makes all the difference - I chose Famous Dave's Rich and Sassy.  I'm making this again tomorrow because of the high demand!

I should probably give this 5 stars since I did not use a high-end BBQ sauce as others have suggested.  I had fresh chicken breasts, so I cooked it on high for 2 hrs then dropped it to low for another 2 hours.  I did add a little extra italian dressing and the chicken was nice and tender and had an okay flavor.  I will use this recipe again but I'll try it with Sweet Baby Ray's or Jack Daniels BBQ sauce instead.

I made it exactly as recipe states.  I used Hunts original bbq sauce, cooked it for 2 hours, shredded it, put in back in the crockpot for another 45 min.  It turned out pretty good.  It is very easy.  I can't wait to taste it on top of some pre-packaged salad mix.

What an easy and tasty chicken dish! I added some minced garlic and onion to the sauce. Before serving, we sprinkled some shedded cheddar cheese on the tops and it was a hit in our house. I will for sure make this again.

I made this when we had friends over, and everyone loved it! We served them on buns with smoe shredded Mozzarella cheese overtop... even my DH who is such a picky eater has requested i make enough of it so there is left overs to bring to work the next day in his lunch!!

The 2nd time i made it we had fresh chicken breast -- so I cooked it in chicken broth for 2 hours on high. Strained it & forked it apart. Then added the Bullseye BBQ, etc. and let it cook on high for another hour and 15 mins?? Then the hubby couldn't wait anymore and dug in. :D

It was perfect!!! Not dry at all.. and time friendly when coming home and preparing it AFTER work.

My husband absolutely loved this recipe! The chicken was literally falling apart in the slow cooker it was so tender!! The combination of italian dressing and BBQ was really good!! The chicken was extremely moist and just wonderful! Thanks for this recipe.

Oh my goodness! Super easy and super delicious.  My husband and I have married for almost 9 years and my husband says he thinks this is one of my top ten meals. My 5,3&1 year old loved it too.  We all had seconds. I used Sweet Baby Ray's Bar B Q sauce, since it is my favorite.  I shredded the chicken and served it over rice using the extra sauce as gravy.  This recipe will be a regular on my monthly menu.  Thanks!

I made this with my stepdaughter in mind as she loves barbecue chicken. The italian dressing sounded so odd but if you think about it, the vinegar in the dressing acts as a tenderizer for the chicken. It was SO easy to make and turned out so delicious. Chicken just ended up falling apart it was so tender and moist. Great flavor and great on sandwiches the next day. Using frozen chicken made this recipe easy-peasy!

There recipe was easy but my husband and I didn't like it.  After cooking the chicken for the time the recipe stated, my chicken was very dry.  We used Jack Daniel's bbq sauce.  The flavor just wasn't there for us.  We won't use this recipe again.

Oh my gosh....this recipe was FANTASTIC!!!  I cooked this for 8 hours on low in my crock pot then shredded the chicken and put that and more of the sauce on hoagie rolls.  Hubby took one bite and nearly fell off his chair!!  He ate two sandwiches for dinner and I packed two for his lunch the next day and this is a man who does not normally really like leftovers!!  This is a keeper!!!!!

Made this tonight. I loved it.  DH and  younger son (19) didn't care for it.  I added a dash of sesame oil and lite soy sauce.   I will definately be making this again.  Older son will probably love it too.

I TRIED THIS RECIPE OUT LAST NIGHT...IT WAS DELICIOUS! I CHOPPED UP AN ONION AND A FEW POTATOES AND ADDED IT, AND IT WAS GREAT! I USED HONEY BBQ SAUCE, AND DOUBLED THE AMOUNT OF BROWN SUGAR. AWESOME! THIS WORKS WELL TO SERVE PEAS AND RICE ON THE SIDE!

This was OK, it was a bit bland. You definitely need to use a lot of bbq sauce. I found the chicken to be very dry.

Excellent and very easy. Only did one thing different. I made the sauce a little thicker with a little cornstarch at the end. Tasted super over rice and I have a very picky husband! Thanks for a quick and easy meal

This was good. I didn't put it on bread, just made it as is and served it with rice. I like it, but I think it will be better on a hoagie bun like a few people have suggested. Thanks!

This was just okay. I did like that it was an easy throw-together for a hectic morning, and I might make it again, but in the end, it was kind of boring. I shredded the chicken when I got home from work and served it on toasted hard rolls with melted swiss cheese, which was a nice flavor combo. It just didn't impress me or my fiance very much. Still, it's ingredients I always have on hand, so it could come in handy for a "I forgot to plan tonight's dinner" morning in the future.

This is a very easy recipe and great for when you will be gone for the day.  It's not a five star recipe, but we will make it again.

This was great!  I LOVE using my crockpot...especially this time of year, so this recipe is perfect for the busy holiday season.  The only change I made was using light Italian dressing.  The sauce was delicious!  I doubled the recipe, hoping to have shredded chicken sandwiches the next day with the leftovers. My family devoured it and didn't leave enough for another meal for all of us!  Will make again!  Next time I might just shred it for sandwiches from the start!

This was great.  The chicken was so tender, it shredded naturally.  Like another reviewer suggested, I pre-cooked in chicken broth, then drained the last hour.  Delicious!

I loved this recipe! I used chicken the first time and shred it up to put on buns. The other time I tried it I only had some pork loins availiable, so I used that and shred them up at the end of cooking. It came out great both times! I will use again and again.

I served this with mashed potatos and it was a hit! I took the suggestion of anoother reviewer and cooked mine in chicken broth before hand. It was so yummy and not dry at all, as others had said. My husband was upset that I didn't make more. Thanks for sharing!

MMMM Good!!  Hits the spot everytime!  I follow the recipe without changes and it turns out perfect...and its sooo easy!  The only thing I may try in the future is a little less sugar, sometimes it is a little too sweet.

Made just like recipe called for using frozen chicken breast. Came out delicious, moist and tender. Used sweet Baby Ray's sauce and Zesty Italian dressing. Good meal considering the little effort. Shreaded the meat and served over white rice. Umm good.

This was like eating chicken sloppy joes.  It was okay.  I liked it more than my husband, but I have whole bunch left over and it's just not going to get eaten.  If you're short on time or you're suffering through a heat wave and don't mind a so-so meal, this is perfect.  I served on hoagie rolls.

Good recipe, which hubby and I enjoyed very much. Used Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ Sauce, A balsamic Vinagreitte 
 and added some minced garlic to the crockpot, . Certainly can't beat this one in terms of ease, as well... will definitely be making it again.    Thanks, Zanne.

I am rating this based on ease of prep, inexpensive ingredients used, versatility of finished preparation,and the fact that one can have a hot meal in the summer without heating up a kitchen.  Sauce can be tinkered with to suit one's taste.  I would suggest both a good barbecue sauce and robust italian dressing for a good outcome.  I added 1 can of diced petite cut tomatoes,chopped vidalia, garlic cloves, green pepper, and onion soup mix to 6 bone in skinless breasts.  Made this into minced barbecue and could be served over potatoes or rice, or on a bun.  I added the sauce until it just covered and had some leftover.

When I first read this recipe I thought "This is too good to be true" - well I was right.  I used Kraft BBQ sauce and it was not good.  No one ate it at my house.

Wonderful and so easy!  I used whole chicken breasts (3) and shredded one hour prior to serving.  I used a barbecue sauce that isn't sweet - Gates - so next time I will actually add just a bit more brown sugar.  This is a great thing to make when you don't want to heat up the kitchen during the summer - thanks!

Yum!  I added more bbq sauce and also 1/3 cup of water (my crockpot is big and tends to dry things out).  I reserved a bit of the sauce and added it about 45 minutes before serving.  Seemed watery, but once I shredded the chicken it absorbed most of the juice.  It was perfect. Served on buns with roasted potatoes on the side.  Keeper!

This was edible, but nothing to get excited about.  I also shredded it for sandwiches.  It was much too watery so I drained quite a bit the juice and added a little more BBQ sauce.  No one in the family was crazy about it.  I won't bother to make it again.

Easy and tasty.  Will make again.  I took the advice of others and shredded the chicken towards the end and put it back in the crockpot for an hour.  Drizzled olive oil on hoagie rolls and toasted them up on a grill pan.  Made very good sandwiches.  I'm glad I shredded the chicken because I tasted it while shredding it and thought that it was a bit dry - not awfully dry, but I'm not sure I would've liked it as much whole.  When I was talking to my husband and my mother about the recipe and I said it was chicken, they both said "this is chicken?!" - they thought it was pork.  hehehe  Not bad...the flavor of pork, but made with healthier chicken.

This was so easy to make!  I cooked it for company and everyone enjoyed it.  My husband said that some pieces were dry, but the sauce made up for it.  I really enjoyed that I could start with frozen chicken breasts.  I also served it with homemade garlic bread for a type of BBQ sandwich.

This took less than 2 minutes to throw in the crockpot on my way out the door in the morning, and was a huge hit with my entire family - picky eaters included.  I served it over baked potatoes with a green salad.  Delicious!

This was pretty good. And, not to mention super easy. The sauce was both sweet and sour, so it made for an interesting taste sensation. Served with Lipton Onion Soup Roasted Potatoes and Green Beans. Very good.

Very EASY...love that!  Also very tasty.  I think I ccoked mine on high a little too long.  I will try taking them out earlier next time and shredding them.  The chicken was extremely tender and had a good flavor.

So easy and good, the leftovers didn't last past lunch the next day. My husband and 16 month old loved this too.
