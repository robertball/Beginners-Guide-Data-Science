There is 1 thing I did different in the end and that was sprinkle cinnamon over the top. I feel it lacked flavor and the top did not set like I thought it would. Next time I will use less of the syrup from the peaches.

This is how my family always made peach cobbler, except we melted the butter in the pan, layered the peaches and the  syrup and poured the batter on top. I think it comes out about the same either way. Dump out about half the syrup. You can also use fresh peaches , about 4 cups sliced with about a tablespoon l lemon juice and about 1/4 cup sugar . The crust is soft like pudding cake. Not like a pie crust topping that a lot of people use.

2.23.16   I took the suggestion of the first reviewer and added only half of the juice from the can of peaches.  I cut this recipe in half, and in an effort to lighten it a bit, I did use lite peaches, skim milk, TruviaÂ® for baking, and ICBINB spread.  I'm not convinced you need this much butter, and if I make this again, I'll try it with half the amount in the recipe.   Added a good shake of of cinnamon and a sprinkle of turbinado sugar before going into the oven.  This tastes very similar to something my mother made when I was child.  Maybe not rocket science, but we enjoyed it.
