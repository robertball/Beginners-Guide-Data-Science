These bars are quick and easy to make, have a buttery-rich shortbread base, a sweet and moist strawberry filling, and a drizzle of almond-flavored icing.   A 5-star recipe in this house and a keeper for sure.  Thanks, dthomas, for a delicious new dessert.

I used raspberry jam as well as strawberry and LOVED it! This dessert is by far my very favorite. Very sweet, so be sure to cut the portions somewhat small.

These bars were too sweet and "doughy" tasting. They were very rich, so I served in tiny squares. Husband usually likes most things I bake; not these. :(

this was completely a wreck. I followed the recipe, it looked OK but tasted awful!

I made this. It was pretty good AS I MADE it. Although a tad too sweet.
 I found my cupboard lacking good jam. So I cooked down some  (1 c.)  fresh berries with a pinch of nutmeg and 2 tbsp of sugar and combined with 2 heaping tbsp of actual seedless strawberry jam. This gave a better texture in the fruit area. And in fact I will add even more fresh berries next time closer to the end to make the filling even chunkier), but I did have to cook it down quite a bit to get it to a jam consistency.
 I Will also add some ground almonds to the short crust AND the topping ( i will have to work out how much).
