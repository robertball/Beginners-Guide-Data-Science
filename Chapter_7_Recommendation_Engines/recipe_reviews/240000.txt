We love a summer meal of fresh corn on the cob and chilled sliced tomatoes, so I felt pretty certain that we'd like this any time of the year, and we did.  I used Birds EyeÂ®  frozen baby gold and white corn and when combined with multi-colored grape tomatoes, this quick salad not only tasted good, but it looked good!  Simple ingredients for a simple salad with great results.

Great!  It's definitely a keeper recipe.  I did make one major change, I used canned corn because I already had it.  

One can is 1-1/2 cups, so if you make this change, you will either have a more acidic salad or you can add a second can if you want the corn to be center stage.  I went with the first, cause I absolutely love tomatoes.  I did not reduce anything else, but next time I will likely reduce or skip the apple cider vinegar since it's already so acidic.

This is a great basic dish, and you can go through your fridge/freezer/pantry and add more to change it up, or use up other items you have on hand.  

This would be great as a bread topping as well.

I made this salad with frozen corn, purchased basil, and homegrown tomatoes. I enjoyed this salad, but next time will add finely sliced scallions or just a bit of finely diced red onion...and maybe use a milder vinegar. I ate this salad as my 'carb' with a bacon-wrapped turkey tenderloin...delicious complement!

This was a nice side salad, but a little plain tasting.  I ended up adding some green onion. Next time I might use canned corn instead of frozen.
