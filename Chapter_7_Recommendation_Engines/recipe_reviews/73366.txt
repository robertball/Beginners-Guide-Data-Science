This was good and went well with my grilled ribeyes. I reduced the recipe to four servings and thought the amount of red pepper flakes and herbes de provence seemed to be too much so I reduced to a sprinkling of each.

I also thought that the recipe called for way too much red pepper flakes and herbes de Provence; I just used a little of each. I made these on the Foreman grill, and they turned out well, but I wouldn't mind doing them in the oven like garlic bread. We thought this was really tasty. Thanks, McMiguel!

Very good.  Don't turn your back; they will burn quickly.

I used this as a spread and broiled instead of dipping and grilling.  Will add more blue cheese next time.  I really liked the addition of the  W sauce.

i used more cheese than called for, and i think it helped for the burning problem. i had to cook these suckers much longer than the 1 minute described, and none burnt. they were good, but i actually thought they needed more flavor. i would more than double the cheese and herbs next time. also tasted good with a little marinara.

Very good flavor but a bit too potant. I would use a little bitt less garlic, butter and pepper. I still give it a 5 for the flavor. But either you have to get a lot more bread, or use less topping because its a VERY strong flavor!!

these were good but very rich.  I never thought I would say: almost too much butter.

Grilled bread with lots of flavor.  I wanted to use up some leftover hamburger buns, so that became the bread base for these Hot Ponderosas.  I mixed up all the ingredients, but omitting the cheese.  I dipped the buns, both sides, into the butter mixture and then grilled one side.  Once my DH grilled one side, I flipped the bread over and added the cheese and grilled the bottom side.  I made 2 pieces with bleu cheese for me, and topped the others with feta cheese for the rest of the family.  Served these with 'Summertime Tomato Salad' and 'Roasted Beer Butt Lime Chicken', both AR recipes.

Made these in the oven since we were without a gas/charcoal grill at our vacation location. I recommend topping with the blue cheese after you dunk them. Love the saltiness and the garlicky crunch.

This was yummy! I used all of the ingredients listed, subbing a Italian seasoning for the herbes de Provence, which I did not have. I only had a little less than a 1/2 of a baguette, so I just eyeballed everything to taste, but I couldn't imaging those quantities for just 1 baguette, but that's my opinion. I cooked these under the broiler and that worked well. Loved the addition of the Worcestershire sauce, in fact, all of the flavors went together nicely! I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Only 4 stars, although I used it as a spread and under the broiler.  I adjusted the measurements to teaspoons instead of Tablespoons and it was still plenty spicy!  Next time I will reduce the Red Pepper Flakes even more, sub the "Herbes De Provence" with Italian Seasoning, and increase the blue cheese as suggested by other reviewers. Thx for sharing - really fun and different.

THis was just OK for us.  I was expecting an explosion of flavor that I never really found.  I think I may give this one more try in the oven/under the broiler instead of grilling and see if that changes my opinion.  THANKS for the recipe, MCMIGUEL!
