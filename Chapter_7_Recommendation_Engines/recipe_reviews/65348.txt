okay folks, learn from my mistakes!  I used corn chex as my cereal so the recipe is NOT sweet!  When taking out of oven it will be very gooey, that's okay as it will set as it cools.  I put mine in the microwave for an extra 7 min. as I thought my oven wasn't hot enough.  Needless to say it started to get that just started to burn aroma/taste.  Anyway, it definitely needs some color so we added raisins and some marshmallows.  Make sure you are POSITIVE the snack is cool or you will get a gooey snack....do you really need to ask how I know that?  I wouldn't say it's the best snack, but with some tweaking I'm sure it could be.  Next time I will try some frosted mini-wheats, or frosted flahes, or (if my kids beg enough)I'll buy some cinnamon toast crunch and use that!

I followed the recipe exact. I think it could use a mix of something besides oat cereal and peanuts. Maybe next time, I'll try this with pretzles and add some raisins or Craisins. As is, it still was quite tasty and my kids have already eaten half.

We really liked this.  Next time I'll try natural peanut butter & not add the additional peanuts.

I made this for my daughter's ski team and they all loved it.  I had many requests for more batches of this snack.  I will definitely make it again.  I followed the recipe except for the type of peanut butter - I used Skippy Natural instead and it turned out perfectly.
