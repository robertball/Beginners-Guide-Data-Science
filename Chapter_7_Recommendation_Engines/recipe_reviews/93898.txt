I wasn't sure how this would be with a full teaspoon of cumin, but it was very tasty.  Just a little too salty--I think I'll go with 1/2 tsp. salt next time.  Very easy to make!

I made this as an accompaniment to an Indian dinner.  It was very refreshing but both my roommate and I agreed that it could have used just a pinch less salt.  Otherwise, delicious!

Cool and refreshing!  Even though I don't normally use salt, this drink needs it, so I used it.  It's good both plain or iced!  Thanks for the recipe!

I read the comments about saltiness and only added 1/4 tsp which was pretty good. I also love cilantro, so I put 1 Tbsp and a little less than 1 tsp cumin (which I don't care for as much). I used almond milk instead of regular milk. Overall, I thought the balance was still too salty, but I enjoyed a new way to experience one of my favorite herbs!

So so good. But thankfully I read the other reviews first and only put in 1/2 tsp of salt (per two servings) and it was just the perfect amount. Can't imagine anymore than that. Also, I love cilantro so added a bit more than was listed here.

I love having a salted lassi with Indian food and I usually order one whenever we eat out.  This is just about the same as in restaurants and is yummy.  Works as a smoothie on its own, with Mexican food or with Indian food.

I love plain lassis, but I made it exactly according to the recipe and neither my boyfriend nor I could finish it because it was waaay too salty.  I know I would have liked it had I used less salt.  I will try this again, but next time I will start out with 1/4 tsp salt.  You can always put more salt in, but you can't take it out!
