Because so many of you said this didn't have enough flavor I added extra beef broth (dry), onion flakes, 2 bay leaves and extra thyme - oh and don't forget garlic!  When I added the onions and mushrooms I found a few tablespoons of balsamic vinegar made a great improvement - just the right fruity sweetness and tartness to go with the savory.  Play with this recipe, it's a good base!

I browned my meat and then put all the ingredients in the crockpot for 8 hours on low-delicious, especially when served with mashed potatoes!

A great recipe that can be adapted for the crock pot.  I cooked it on low for 8 hours and served it over mashed potatoes with green beans for my father's 81st birthday. He loved it as did the rest of the guests.

This is a good recipe.  I hardly ever follow a recipe to a "T" so of course I added my own touch.   The key to a good beef burgundy is getting a good reduction.  I flour the beef and then saute it, after it is browned then I deglaze the pan with some of the wine.  I then carmelize the onions lighly and saute the mushrooms, followed by another deglaze consiting of wine and balsamic vinegar.    Like others stated it is good in a crockpot after all the ingredients are assembled because it will reduce and thicken.

Yummy!  This had excellent flavor and the beef turned out surprisingly tender for such a tough cut.  Next time I will cut back on the onions or just use small ones) and I'll add some garlic while browning the meat for added flavor.

This dish was delicious!  The only thing I changed was adding minced garlic per other reviewers and omitted mushrooms since I don't like them.  I will definitely make this again.

My husband has never raved about my cooking until I made this recipe! This is no joke, he actually licked the sauce off of his plate, he loved it so much!The only change I made was I put 2 tsps. of minced garlic in while browning the meat. I also ended up adding just a little more wine to cover. This recipe was to die for! Thank you for helping me make my picky husband happy!

What I ended up with was little cubes of meat in a liquid so didn't know how to serve it.  I mixed it with egg noodles and served it in a bowl with hard rolls.  We enjoyed dipping our rolls in the sauce. It was very tasty, reminded me a lot of a frozen dinner we had before.  I skipped the oil and flour part and fried the meat plain to spare unneeded fat calories.  I used canned beef broth, a small can of mushrooms and 1 small onion, and everthing else as described.  The meat came out very tender        and the juice was awesome.  This spelled terrible cooking.  Next time I will either keep the meat one piece and serve as a side or find a way to thicken the juice.  This didn't taste like beef burgundy, more like au jus for roast beef.

I used this recipe for venison loins instead of beef- it came out so tender and the gravy was very flavorful.  I had a lot of extra liquid so I combined some flour paste into it to thicken it up a bit.  I served it over rice, but instead I think this would have made great hot open faced sandwiches accompanied with mashed potatoes and peas.  It tasted like a rich pot roast and gravy to me, but without all the fat from beef.  Will make this again!

This recipe was awesome!  I followed the recipe and cooked it for 1 1/2 hours.  Then I put the meat and sauce into a casserole dish and put it in the oven at 200 degrees for 5 hours and the meat was extremely tender and the sauce thickened up nicely.  If you are looking for a slow cooking method, this is it.  We will have this again.

Excellent Rich Flavor.  Easy to prepare.  I followed the recipe using a Cabernet Savignon and made the following changes.  1. only used one onion (thats all i had on hand, but thats all you need) 2. I used 1 jar of siliced shitake mushrooms(also all I had on hand).  3. I did add about 3 tsp of minced garlic during the browning as others suggested.  4. added 1/2 tsp of bay leaves and doubled the black pepper.  I served this over egg noodles and it got rave reviews.  The only reason i didnt give it 5 stars is it is a really soupy finished product and i even tried to thicken it w/ addt'l flour.  but the flavor alone makes this a definite keeper and I will just work on reducing the liquid more next time.  Oh, I also used cheap, cubed stew meat, and it was fork tender, and very very good.  I did do the stovetop simmer as written in the recipe, but I can see how this would be a very easy transistion into a slow cooker recipe.  Thanks for a easy and tasty recipe Faith!

I cut back on the onion; using two medium sized onions instead of three and I also added about one tablespoon of minced garlic.  I also added two teaspoons of garlic powder and I thickened the sauce at the end with cornstarch mixed with water.  Delicious over noodles.  We dipped our biscuits in the sauce.  I will definitely make this again.

YUMMY! This was way better than I was thinking it would be, because of some of the reviews. I used a chuck roast because that's what I had. I think that people who thought it was tough might not have cooked it long enough... not too long. I ended up cooking mine for longer than stated, but that is because my hubby likes his meat very tender. I think it was a little over two hours. the flavor was awesome. I sauteed mushrooms on the side for the ones who like them and the flavor was still great. I used a wine that was pretty tasty to drink, & I think that makes a difference. I did add two cloves of garlic(pressed) at the end with the onions. I resisted the urge to add the onions in the beginning, and am glad that I did. I didn't measure my flour(or salt and pepper I added to season it) or oil... floured the meat before browning, and did a few different batches of meat to get each one totally browned. The sauce turned out a nice consistancy to cover egg noodles and stick to the meat. It was truly fantastic. Thank you for this recipe! My kids and hubby gobbled it up! : )

I made this in a crockpot without browning first and it was excellent.
I like to make extra to freeze so I used 3lbs of cut up cubes of  Chuck that I got at COST** (The big warehouse store) Their meat is always tender, I did 1.5x the recipe, and used mushroom soup mix because I didn't have mushrooms, and dry beef gravy mix w/only 1c water. (not the recommended 2c broth)because the beef makes liquid while cooking, and the reduction of the 1c. made it thicker which I liked.
Excellent recipe

Just OK.  Nobody really cared for it.  It did smell nice while it was cooking, but it was awfully "soupy".

Carrots, cut the same size as the beef..1 lb worked with marjoram.
1/2 lb of chopped bacon will give the glaze and opl to brown the beef.... tons of flavor
I added 3/4 cup of Conac and flamed it off 
For a super rich flavor added 10 juniper berrys crushed.. worked with bay leaf and thyme better
This is as close to the real french classic prep

We loved this recipe.

I chose to add some brown sugar to our recipe.

For us left overs turned out to be so much better.

This had good flavor, I just used 2 onions and it was plenty oniony.  Lots of broth. I cooked the beef in the wine and broth and added some baby carrots, in the oven in a covered cast iron pot for 1 1/2 hrs at 275.  Beef was fork tender.  I served it over noodles, delish.  I had so much left over  I made a beef pot pie with the leftovers. I used a prepared pie crust,  added a lb. of frozen vegetables and 2 diced cooked potatoes.  Great, versatile recipe.  Mushrooms and burgundy added a nice flavor to the pot pie.

I followed the recipe except for the onion, I only had one and the beef broth. I used 3 bouillion cubes in two cups of water. I browned the meat in a pan but instead of cooking on the stove I put it in the slowcooker for about six hours. It was very flavorful and very tender. I served it over rice. 
I would definetly make this again. It's good.
Oh I also thickened the sauce with cornstarch.

I was disappointed in this recipe.  Definitely needs to be thickened quite a bit.  It just wasn't that flavorful.

My daughter loved this recipe and had seconds.  My husband and I were disappointed....not in the recipe but in the cut of meat we selected.  Cooking so long made the meat tough.

Just made this dish for my husband and teenage son. WOW! Husband devoured it and kept raving about how good it was. It was also VERY EASY to prepare. I did make a couple of minor changes: 2 onions instead of 3, and extra thyme. I also added 2 whole garlic cloves and would probably add more next time, and I thickened the gravy at the end with a bit of flour. YUMMY!

I did not care for this.  There was no flavor and way too many onions.  It was like onions in broth with a few pieces of meat in it.

This was pretty good, though not great. For some reason I thought that the sauce would be thicker and richer.

This had a nice flavor, but, just not enough of it. It lacked "oomph". I even tried to salvage by adding minced garlic, oregano, more salt and pepper. I thought that the sauce was too runny and wish I had used some cornstarch to thicken it up. Served over egg noodles. I doubt that I will make this again.

I received nothing but rave reviews of this recipe when I made it this past weekend.  I am just beginning to learn how to cook real meals and I found this to be easy to prepare and an enjoyment to eat.  I can't wait to make it again!

This was excellent! I can’t believe how easy it was to make. I bought the precut stew beef from the grocery store and dredged it in a mixture of flour, salt, pepper, and garlic powder. I browned it like the recipe says and added the liquids. Because my family doesn’t like mushrooms, I substituted baby carrots for the mushrooms. I put them in about an hour before it was finished, and they were very tender. I did end up cooking it longer because I had the time and wanted to make sure that the beef was very tender, which it was. I served it over egg noodles. I will definitely make this again. I’d like to try it in the crockpot as others have suggested.

We used Sirloin tip, it's a more tender cut, and only two onions.  After following the rest of the recipe as suggested we were disappointed only because it came out so 'runny' We added more flour to thicken it but it was still very thin. My thinking is that the wine and broth content  were too much. Next time I will cut these down to 1 cup each.

This was so good! I was out of red wine so used white. I'll definitely make it again with red wine. I think the added richness will make it really amazing. Served it over bowtie pasta. YUM!

Sooooo yummy and satisfying, wow.  I used stew beef, omitted the salt, and only added one onion.  Absolutely scrumptious, and perfect for a cold winter day.

Added garlic, bay leaves and a tbs of Worcester sauce and extra beef boullion powder to make the flavor pop. I only needed one large onion. Made equal parts burgundy and beef stock and thickened liquid with a flour and water mixture at the end. Served over   rice and had rave reviews. No need to waste the rice; stirred the leftover rice into the stew and had wonderful microwave leftovers the next day.

I used top sirloin which I cut while still partially frozen...cooked in a slow cooker for about 8 hours on low....tender and flavorful...stayed moist...I added the mushrooms after I took it from the slow cooker, while it was still bubbling....worked out fine....

It was really good. I ended up adding a little more wine because I reduced my stock too much.  It wasn't soupy at all.  Just reduce it to the consistency you want.  The more your reduce it, the more flavor you'll get.

I LOVE this recipe. I changed a few things, but not much. I coat the beef pieces IN the flour before dropping them into the pan. I hate how the flour clumps up when you just sprinkle it over. But other than that, do it all the same. If the sauce is too thin when it comes time to serve, then I do sprinkle in a bit of flour and it works like a charm. We serve it over wide egg noodles with hot rolls to soak up any remaining juice. Its so good! Enjoy!

This was wonderful.  I made it just as the recipes except my roast was frozen and so I just threw everything in the crock pot and let it cook all day while I was at work.  I used Merlot and the flavor was beyond anything we imagined.  Everyone loved it and it was so simple.

I actually made a couple tweaks to the recipe. I definitely use all of the ingredients listed (except for the olive oil -- explanation below), and actually taste throughout to determine my preference, which I highly recommend, but here are my secrets (my recipe is definitely a 5-star recipe).

Use better meat than round steak. Cut up a filet, a NY Strip, a Ribeye, etc., into smaller squares.

The first thing I do in making the burgundy is to cut up small pieces of bacon and cook them in a sauce pan. Instead of using olive oil, I use the bacon to cook everything in.

Instead of noodles, I cut up redskin potatos, baste with olive oil, garlic, salt, pepper, and bake to a golden crip. I then put the meat over the potatoes, which is much better than noodles.

Use garlic cloves, and beef buillion to make the sauce, in addition to the above.

Enjoy this.

Excellent recipe! Used some of the suggestions from fellow reviewers: added garlic, cooked an extra hour, added carrots(when liquid was added) and browned the meat with the onions & garlic. Used a few sprinkles of xanthan gum to thicken instead of cornstarch. Served over linguini & with fresh green beans in a hollandaise sauce. My wife loved it!

I really liked this recipe!  I used a jar of mushrooms, as they're not my favorite, and also threw in a can of French Onion soup, 'cause it was in the cupboard.  I will definately make this again!

I was really excited about this recipe.  I just wasn't thrilled with the outcome.  Now, I don't tend to cook with wine - and don't drink it, so that was not a winning factor for me.  I made in the crock pot and at first it seemed that it would be too tough, and then it turned out too dry.  I gave it a go.  I don't think there's anything I could do that would make it better for us, so we'll skip it in the future.

Oh wow... This recipe is amazing!!! My fiance and I have never tried beef burgundy before, but we were both pleasantly surprised. He even ate dinner slowly, relishing every bite of this yummy dish (as opposed to practically inhaling his dinner). I think I browned the steak too long though. I had never browned steak before. Next time I think I'll brown it a little less than I did. But other than that, it was fantastic. I also made garlic mashed red potatoes and apple crisp for dessert. Mmmmmmm. I will definitely make this again and again and again!

As is, this rates a 4.  I used canned beef broth (diluted with water as per the label), so with the 1 tsp of salt, it was way too salty.  I had to add a diced potato and a can of tomato paste to take the saltiness away.  

I also used a lot of garlic per other readers' comments, and I used some baby carrots and celery.  With my modifications, this is definitely a 5.

I didn't have problems with the broth beeing too watery.  I browned the meat in oil, then after it was browned I stirred in the flour.  Once it was thoroughly mixed in, I then added the broth and liquid.  It turned out a beautiful, rich brown.  

I'll definitely make this again!

The sauce and mushrooms were fantastic.  The meat was not--ended up tough and overdone.  I will be trying this again, but it may take some work to figure out what went wrong.

This was pretty good.  I too thought it needed a little something and I had added lots of garlic and a little red pepper flake.  Also my sauce never did thicken enough for us.  I did brown the onions and mushrooms with the beef and flour.  Served it over bow ties pasta, and both hubby and I were adding a lot of salt and pepper to taste.

Wonderful!  I will definitely be making this again.  I added a little more beef broth instead of wine (only because I was out of wine lol!)when I added the mushrooms and onions.  I used a good quality Cabernet Sauvignon and I thickened the sauce with 2 Tbsp cornstarch mixed in some room temp beef broth.  Served it over rice.  Thanks for the great recipe Faith.

My husband loved this, but I thought it was a little bland.  I think the quality of the wine used probably wasn't that great - next time I think I would buy a more expensive wine to intensify the flavor.  I will try again though because the beef was tender and delicious.  Thanks!

This tasted pretty good .. but it lacked a few things for me.  It needed more flavour so next time I might try adding garlic, and the sauce was too runny and there wasnt enough of it.  I may try reducing the meat slightly and doubling or even tripling the stock and wine, and also thickening it.  The other thing was my meat became much overcooked, and I only let it simmer for 30minutes.  I may try this one again, but with the appropriate changes.

I found this recipe a bit tasteless, and not something I would make again.

I personally did not like this, but that is my bias because I don't like stewed meat.  However, I rate it highly because I cooked it for my mother who does like stews and she thoght that the meat was really tender, and the sauce had a lovely flavour.

Fantastic! My husband adored the onions and loved the flavourful beef; my picky two-year-old was most fond of the gravy.. we poured it over steamed white rice for her, and she just couldn't get enough of it. What a great recipe.

This is a good recipe. It just needs a little more flavoring.

Disappointing.  Wrong cut of meat used and the gravy was not as expected, rather more like an average beef stew.

Absolutely incredible...  I made this for Valentine's Day, and my husband & I agree that it is probably the best steak we have ever had!  I even ate mine medium rare (I'm usually a medium well person) because the flavor was so rich, I didn't want to ruin it by over-grilling.  Will DEFINATELY make again!  Thank you!!!

I needed an easy recipe for Beef Burgundy and this was the first one that popped up on the site.  This was a first web recipe I have tried, and the dish won rave reviews with the family.  We plan on using in alot in the future.  Thanks RH
