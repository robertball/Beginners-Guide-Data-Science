I thought it was pretty good.  Hubby did not care for it very much.  May make it again, but when hubby is out of town : )

I've tried another recipe very similiar to this one, sans the white wine, artichokes and olives.. but this recipe really kicks it up a notch.  Absolutely delicious!!!  The only thing I did differently was sauteeing the garlic and onion fresh, instead of using it with canned tomatoes. Again.. EXCELLENT recipe!!  Thank you for sharing :)

Easy and delicious.  My daughters loved it, too, as long as there were no olives!

A very hearty and robust sauce.  My husband and I enjoyed it very much.  I love olives and instead of the sliced canned ones which I find rather flavorless, I used kalamata olives that I de-stoned and halved.  I also loved how quickly and easily the sauce came together.

This was very easy to make and very tasty.  I omitted the olives, because I didn't have any on hand, and used dried rosemary and parsley and it still came out fine.
