The only thing I didn't like about these cookies is that they baked out soooo flat!!! Like pancake flat! Otherwise they were very yummy :)

Three stars but only if you reduce the salt to 1/2 tsp. as I did.  Even at that these were plenty salty and I can't imagine, for flavor OR health reasons, using a full 1-1/2 tsp. of salt.  That said, while great tasting and buttery (if you use all butter as I did and NO margarine), this was not the type of chocolate chip cookie I like but I know it appeals to others.  It's just a matter of personal preference that I don't care for a soft, moist chocolate chip cookie as this is. (The higher proportion of brown sugar is partly responsible for that) If you like the Original Nestle Toll House Cookie recipe this is a step above that both in appearance as well as flavor.
