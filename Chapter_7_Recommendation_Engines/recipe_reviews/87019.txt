This was yummy, even with sweet pickles and I am not a fan of sweet pickles. I guess all the other ingredients just balance everything out. My new favorite hot dog topping.

I was leary at first, but one delicious bite was all it took! 'Course I am a die hard hot dog fan - but this topping put my dog over the top! Thanks Hooley!

Hubby loved this Hooley Mooley! He eats hot dogs all the time, so I was looking for something more interesting for him to top them with. So glad I came across this recipe. He also enjoyed this on a bologna sandwich. Thanks!

I found that the recipe ingredients need to be re-scaled, even for a family of 4.  Otherwise it is hard to use 20 servings within 5 days, as suggested.

This was AWESOME!! A new tist on the hot dog! We loved it only thing I did different was using half regular yellow and half spicy mustard. I was also out of horseradish so I used horseradish powder. I didn't scale it down and really glad I didn't as I expect the leftovers to be 10x better tomorrow. Thx for the awesome recipe!!

This was very very good.  We can't get horseradish in where we live, so I made it with a little extra brown mustard (with the yellow) that had dill and mustard seed in it.  We used it at our son's birthday party and everyone loved it.  Somebody was even using it for a chip dip.  (-:

First I thought this relish was too spicy for me, but I found myself eating 3 hot dogs with it - I really don't like hot dogs, so this is the best thing I like with it, didn't change a thing.  Spicy but addicting.  It does make a lot, so scale down if it's just a few of you.

I saw this and thought I would like to try something different. Boy was this it. My husband read the recipe while I was making it and he said he was prepared Not to Like it, however, both of us loved this. Makes a lot, but I will be sharing some with my friends and family. Made it exactly according to the recipe and will use this often, especially in the summer. Think it will be good on hamburgers as well. Thanks for the recipe Hooley.

I love this recipe! I didn't think it would be worth all the chopping for something that I normally squeeze out of a bottle, but was it ever! This combo complements the meat perfectly. Of course, if you do not use quality ingredients, it may turn out bitter.

This relish is GREAT!  The horseradish added a wonderful zing to it.  I felt like I was eating a Coney Island Dog! It really gave the hot dog alot of pizazz.

I really thought this sounded good, but I hated it.  I thought it had a bitter bite that I could not tolerate.  Sorry, I really wanted to like it.

well i made this for a "hot dog party" as my daughter is a huge hot dog fan and I gotta say, it looks a little iffy once it's made (and it does make a boat load!), but it was a hit!  I had made several chili toppings and relishes and this one by far was the party favorite.  I even had to give out the recipe for it to half of the party guests.  Of course I had a huge container to dole out as well. :)

OK, after reading other reviews, and looking at the ingredients, I made modifications after trying the original.  The ketchup and mustard overpowered everything else.

My suggestions:  try using hot sweet pickles, reduce the mustard and ketchup by 75%, add a few tablespoons of the hot sweet pickle juice.  The family loved it.
