Great recipe!  The flavors blended nicely together.  I added a few sliced mushrooms and used fresh garlic instead of powdered.  The steak was cooked medium on the grill before going into the soup.  Use lots of pepper, it brings out the flavor of the kale and steak nicely!

Thanks for the recipe! I used mushroom broth instead of vegetable juice, and fresh garlic instead of garlic powder. I also added mushrooms, green onion & red wine. And some barley miso. It was wonderful.

This soup was ok.  Not sure if I did something wrong, but it was rather tasteless.  It's definitely going to need to be doc'ed up.

This recipe was great.  So good that I can make it without the beef.  That's a big deal because I am not a fan of kale.  I used lemon pepper since I didn't have any dried onions.  The tanginess of them lemon was a big boost to the recipe.

Great recipe. Used homemade Bloody Mary mix instead of V-8 but didn't change anything else. Would highly recommend!

It is a good, quick, healthy recipe.  But the V8 was a little strong.  I added more pepper and Worcestershire sauce to the leftovers and I liked it better.

Very good!  I added some carrot (chopped small), a little agave syrup (as suggested by another reviewer), a little beef broth base, and a few dashes of Worchestershire sauce.  Cooked it a little longer (due to the carrots).  Doubled the recipe and the Hubster really liked it!  Good use for leftover steak!

Great way to use leftover meat.  I also used fresh garlic and mushrooms.  It was a little acidic but maybe could have added a little sugar or honey to cut it back
