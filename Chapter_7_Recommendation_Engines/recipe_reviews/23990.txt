Very different and colorful. Slightly tart. Makes a ton! Prep time listed is not accurate as the recipe requires a lot of cubing and slicing. Salad tends to be a bit "heavy", containing a lot of meat and cheese.  Too much cheese, I feel. My local deli sells a similar salad, and I've been searching for the recipe. But in comparing the two, I prefer the deli's version. To make it like theirs, next time I'll substitute salami for half of the pepperoni, omit the swiss cheese and add one can of drained garbanzo beans, and add some shredded carrots for extra color. I'll make this again, with the alterations I've stated. Thanks for the recipe! Now I can duplicate my deli's salad!

I took this concoction and made it into a pasta sald with tri-colored rotini and the addition of red wine vinegar. It was great!

I took this salad to a pot luck today.  It was a HUGE hit.  Everyone wanted the recipe!  Don't change ANYTHING, it is awesome just the way it is.  One lady said she put her portion on top of salad and said it was awesome that way too.  A great alternative to a lettuce salad especially at a pot luck where lettuce tends to get mushy.

This is a wonderful antipasto-type salad.  I made a few minor changes:  1) cut the amount of pepperoni in half, 2) added 1/2 lb of salami, 3) omitted the swiss cheese, 4) added grape tomatoes.  I made it 1-1/2 days before serving and it had a wonderful flavor.  My husband had 3 helpings at dinner and ate the rest the next day.  This is a definite keeper!

This recipe was very heavy and I did not like it as a salad. Although I did not like it, everybody else did. I used the leftovers for a pizza and it was simply AWESOME! I used Boboli prepared crust and pizza sauce. Great use for the leftovers you most likely will have with this recipe.

I cut the recipe in half and it still makes quite a bit.  This is heavy, but very tasty.  My husband and brother-in-law really enjoyed it.

While I very much liked the concept and the taste of this antipasto-type salad, I felt it was too heavy on the meats, cheeses and oils. I halved the amounts of meat and cheese (I also preferred hard salami).  I used artichoke hearts instead of mushrooms, although you could use both.  I liked the idea of having more vegetables, and less meat and cheese.  I also whisked the oil, garlic and oregano separately, with a bit of red wine vinegar.  That way, the salad could be dressed as light or heavy as you would like.  I also made sure that the peppers were drained very well, as that may have added too much liquid.  It is very tasty, and I would make it again.

First of all this is not just my opinion. I served this to a group of 20 and only received a couple of positive opinions. It is also rather expensive, but I wouldn't have minded if it tasted better.  It has a very strong flavor that permeates everything.  Very sorry-I don't like to give a negative review but because of the expense I felt I needed to say something.

The amount of oil used makes for a puddle of oil in the bottom. Cut down on the meat and cheese and oil. All of those canned peppers are also wet, so you don't really need much oil.

This salad is awesome!!  Followed the directions exactly, but I cut the recipe in half.  Made this for my son's 12th birthday party and all the adults loved it (about 15 adults).  Will definitely make again.  P.S. I added a little salami.

Loved this recipe. I made it for a cocktail party. Took the advice of others~used half pepperoni & half salami, omitted the Swiss, otherwise kept everything else the same. (I also think artichoke hearts would be good in this) Received lots of compliments. I like it best as this kind of salad. However, I did add rotini, some red wine vinegar and more oil, oregano, garlic to make a pasta salad for a swim meet a couple days later. Since this makes such a large amount I will use this salad as one of my recipes for our teacher back to school luncheon.

First of all, a 5 minute prep time is ridiculous!  I would like to know how this was accomplished!!  Secondly, way too expensive to make on a regular basis, and I would definitely cut down on a lot of the ingredients--too much cheese, too much pepperoncini, etc.  I would definitely make my own version of this again, with WAY less ingredients.  Also, I would cut it in half, unless, of course, you are making this for a cookout where 50 people will be attending!!!  For your own family, I'd cut it in half and THEN some.  Also, too much oil.......not necessary.

This was delicious, but way too expensive to make on a regular basis.  If I can figure a way to cut costs, I would make it again for sure.

Love this recipe and will use often, with some changes. I do like the 1/2 pepperoni/1/2 salami,& did omit the swiss cheese.   I tried rough chopping each item individually in the food processor, to make a Triscuit topping for New Year. It was great!! Everyone wanted to know recipe....Will make often, and great for weekend trip as it keeps for several days.

As other reviewers suggested, I cut the recipe in half and made several modifications. Since I'm vegetarian, I used tofu pepperoni, left out the mushrooms (personal preference), and added cherry tomatoes, cauliflower and artichoke hearts. Lastly, to try and reduce the fat I only used a couple of tablespoons of olive oil and some light Italian dressing. Served for a large dinner party (15) and the entire thing was almost completely finished. I personally found it "okay". I really liked the addition of the artichokes and cauliflower, but was less keen on the cherry tomatoes. I also found that the cheeses got kind of soft - but, not in a good way. It was as though the marinate melted them a bit even though the dish was left in the fridge to marinate for 3 days. Next time I might try and make a vegan version and leave out all the cheese.

I don’t use pimento or mushrooms. I added red onion and fresh jalapeños. I also switch up the cheeses. I always use mild and sharp cheddar but sometimes I use Swiss or Monterey Jack. I use Romano or Asiago for a little “bite”. My friends love this dish. I will make it again and again
