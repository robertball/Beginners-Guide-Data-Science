Simple to make with outstanding flavor. This is a perfect side salad to a grilled steak, to serve with a frittata for brunch, or even to top a thin crust prosciutto pizza. My favorite way to eat arugula salad is with a simple dressing and no additional toppings. The arugula is flavorful enough to stand alone. Do yourself a favor and make it exactly as written, using arugula. Impressive and tasty!

I'm not a big fan of arugula, so I just made my usual salad and mixed up this dressing to go on top...WOW, it's FANTASTIC! LOVED the simple ingredients in this, the fact that it doesn't make a TON, and, most importantly the flavor, which is sooooo good (I could've drank it, lol)! Made exactly as written and would not change a thing...perfect proportion of flavors...a definite keeper~YUM!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

I really liked this dressing. We made a salad with what we like with butter lettuce and ridichio. I was not familiar with shallots and I liked the way they flavored the dressing without being over-powering like raw onion or garlic. My only changes to dressing were using a different oil, not having olive oil. Also, believe I used white wine vinegar instead of rice. Unfamiliar with shallots, I just minced about 2 tsp. When done, I also added a sprinkle of garlic salt. Already planning this dressing again.

Great dressing--subbed a champagne shallot mustard for the dijon as it was what I had on hand.  Used the dressing on spring lettuce from the garden at Easter and Mother's Day dinners.  Whole family really liked.  It is a light dressing that allows the flavor of the lettuce to shine through.  Will definitely be making again.

Very easy and tasty dressing for arugula. I didn't have shallots so I substituted minced red onion. I wanted to add a sweet fruit to balance the arugula so I tossed in a couple segmented Cuties which added a nice sweetness  and color.

Have a lot of arugula growing in my garden.  The honey mustard vinaigrette goes perfectly with it.  Thank you for sharing the recipe!

Was a bit worried about using all arugula because of it being so peppery sometimes, so bought baby arugula and the salad was AWESOME!  

The dressing complimented the greens beautifully and how simple this was.  Dressing really made the salad - will use it with many other kinds of greens as well!

Absolutely delicious! If anybody is worried about the shallots being overpowering then you can simply soak it (after chopping) in some warm for a while beforehand, maybe 30 mins or so. It just removes some of the oniony-ness and makes them a bit gentler. I added slightly more honey to counterbalance the lemon as I think I put too much in. Great though and works perfect on green leafy salads.

This is wonderful. The dressing is AWESOME and can be used for most green salads. I was out of rice vinegar, so used a White Balsamic vinegar. Every time  I make it, I play with it a bit. Add a scant bit of lemon zest and a 1/4 teaspoon of cream sherry, and it really zings.  We love arugula, but add anything green like avocados, spring greens and sometimes a few packaged tortilla strips for a crunch.  Thank you Sandy. You tweaked our creativity.

To me this is truly the PERFECT way to dress greens!! Simple and really brings out the freshness of whatever leaf lettuces you choose.  I also make marinades this way, I only ever add a few fresh chopped herbs to enhance the protein....delicioso!!

With the peppery bite of arugula, I agree that minimal ingredients allow it to shine. This dressing would really showcase any type of greens. I've even tossed it into a simple red quinoa salad to impart an extra tangy element. It's also a wonderful marinade for chicken! Easy and delicious...a winning combo in my book.
