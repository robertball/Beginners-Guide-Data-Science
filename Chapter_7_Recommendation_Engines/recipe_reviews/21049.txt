This is one of my husband's all time favorite things in the world!  It is worth the saffron!  Served with grilled veggies, rice, bread and cheese and you're in heaven!

The onion juice ruined the taste, in my opinion.  This would have tasted much better with substituting with grated onion instead, and including salt.

The onion juice overpowers everything else.  I loved the color and the method, just not the spices.

I've used this recipe for years.  What a great marinaid. I purchased a juicer just so I could juice onions and ended up juicing so much more.
