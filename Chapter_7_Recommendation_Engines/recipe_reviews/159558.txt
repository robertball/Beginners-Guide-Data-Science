I love this winter drink - I add 1 shot each of peppermint liquor. Baileys , and vodka to a cup of hot chocolate. Warmns you up inside and out!

A nice combination of coffee and Mint.   I was looking for shot recipes for a party I am hosting next week.  This is a pretty good contender.

This is more of a shot than a sipping drink.  Adjust qty for shot vs. glass.
