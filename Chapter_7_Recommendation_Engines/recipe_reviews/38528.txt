I love tomatillos, but they made everything a liquidy mess in this recipe. The taste was okay, it just wasn't mashed potato consistency. More like a chunky stew type of result. It was fun to try something different, though.

These were very good and very moist.  Using the small red potatoes instead of russets makes a huge difference!

My boyfriend and I really liked these; the tomatillos added a bit of a kick. I pureed them as another reviewer suggested before adding them to the potatoes. There were still skins, but we eat mashed potatoes with the potato skins anyway, so it wasn't a big deal. Make sure you know what tomatillos taste like before trying this recipe, because they are sour to begin with.

Frankly, I did not like the tomatillo flavor in the potatoes. The tomatillos made everything taste kind of rancid. The skins of the tomatillos did not disintegrate, leaving odd surprises whilst eating. This recipe might benefit from adding shredded cheddar cheese on top, or just 1 tomatillo instead of 3 or 4.

A neat idea, and pretty tastey. This is a good basic mashed potato recipe. I suggest pureeing the tomatillos after cooking, as the skins never blend with the rest of the mashed potatoes; you have to pick around them. Also, since I was going for non-traditional potatoes, I added some steak seasoning. Yum!

Really good!  Followed recipe, but diced tomatillos before adding to the potatoes.  There were skins, but there were skins from the red potatoes too.  It all worked out and tasted good!

The tomatillos added an odd flavor.  They did not really blend with the potatos. My husband picked them out...
