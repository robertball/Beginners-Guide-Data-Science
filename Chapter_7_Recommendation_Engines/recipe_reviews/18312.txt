THIS RECIPE IS DELICIOUS!! I have been searching for a recipe like my grandmother in-law's lime fluff and it've got to say this is as close as it gets! I made this for a picnic, but my 5 year old son is totally anti-green anything. So, I called it a Shrek marshmallow caserole, and even he loved it. I stirred all the ingredients together and it came out wonderful, I didn't add the nuts just because i'm all about textures and I like the smoothness of it without. The only thing I would change about this recipe in the driections I would have stated to FOLD in the whipped topping, not stir. Otherwise you loose alot ot the fluffyness of the whipped topping of which adds to the texture and fluff aspect of the "lime fluff". Other than that one minor change. this is deffinately a two spoons up!

I made this a few hours ago and it's still soupy! I followed the directions and ingredients exactly.What went wrong? I mixed the dry jello with the whip topping etc. Was that right? I'd appreciate it if the submitter could email me.
Update: I learned that mixing the jello into the pineapple and sour cream first, then folding in the cool whip and marshmallows gently makes a perfect fluff every time! I think I was mixing it to much. Now If I don’t make this every thanksgiving people howl!

Delicious and easy. This was one of several side dishes I prepared with a ham dinner. Absolutely a great dish and something you can be proud to serve at home or any potluck.

Concerning the recipe Lime Fluff, do you make the gelatin up first according to package directions?

If you don't care for the taste of lime, make this with pistachio pudding instead.  Omit the sour cream, and add shredded coconut.  At Christmastime, garnish with maraschino cherries.
One of my husband's favorite salads.

As is my usual habit, I added 2/3 cup chopped celery to this salad and omitted 4 ounces of the whipped topping. (I actually used stiffly beaten whip cream instead). Oh, I also omitted the nuts because of the unwanted fats. Everyone loved it. This will be a keeper with modifications at our house!Thanks Amy. Georgians have a winner in this one.

Could not believe how easy this was.  I used Fat Free whipped topping and Fat Free sour cream.  Worked just fine.  Does not work in a mold, however, as it's so light and airy.  Will definitely make again using various flavors of gelatin.                   Patti Helm

Did it with diet ingredients and it is really good.  Try sometime with strawberry jello.  Might be good.

Delicious! Turned out great! I left the nuts out. For anyone who had trouble with this recipe... I combined the dry jello with the pineapple and juice first and blended that well before adding the sour cream, whipped topping and marshmellows. Stir gently so that you don't disrupt the fluffiness of the whipped topping. I will definately remake this for holidays with different colors of jello.

This was really good -- light and refreshing.  It makes just a ton so be sure to use a big bowl.  I left the nuts out.  Instead I added an 11 oz. drained can of mandarin oranges and a couple of big handfuls of coconut.  It was awesome!

Very tasty and quick to put together! I left out the actual pineapple and just used pineapple juice as I am not a fan of the texture of the fruit in jello. Thanks! I think I will try a different flavor next time (maybe lemon or orange??)

I was looking on this site for a specific jello recipe my Gramma used to make for all of our family functions, and this one is really close to it.  I've omitted the nuts because lots of people in my family won't eat things with nuts in it, and I think it is better without them anyways.  This is a great recipe to bring to potlucks and family gatherings, everybody loves it!  It's one of those old tried and true recipes that is sure to please even the pickiest eaters!

This is a fabulous recipe that everyone loves.  I didn't use the chopped pecans in mine but we really enjoy it.  We also call it green fluffy stuff. (Must be a Michigan thing.)

This is another good picnic salad. As with anything like this that has marshmallows, it is always better the next day when the marshmallows absorb the juice from the fruit!

I halved all ingredients except the cool whip. This was an average tasting jello salad.  I think it would be better with some different fruits. With just the pineapple, it seemed boring. If I made it again, I would use a can of fruit cocktail or manderin oranges, etc. The recipe made alot, even halved.

The kids loved this, but the adults just liked it.  I didn't add the pecans so maybe that was the difference.  It was a nice, lite dessert though.

I doubled the recipe not knowing how much a single bowl made. Whoa! A double batch made a HUGE bowl. After several meals of lime fluff I decided to try freezing it.  Now I always make a double batch and freeze several containers, because this stuff is just as good after freezing and thawing!! This is my "go to" dish for a potluck.

My grandmother used to make this, but she called it Ambrosia. This recipe really brings me home! I don't know one kid that doesn't like this stuff. You can also change the flavor of the gelatain if you don't like lime, but I love it!

Very interesting . Might be better using a different flavor of jello instead of the lime. None of the kids cared for it, my husband ate it but said it wasn't a keeper.

I used lite sour cream and fat free cool whip and it just didn't come out tasting right.  It seemed like the jello didn't totally absorb - had a powdery taste to it that just didn't appeal to the crowd.  Not sure if I'd make this again or not.

I didn’t add the pecans. I will definitely make again probably experimenting with different flavors/fruits.

I halved the recipe using the tool. Perfect amount. Added a can of mandarin oranges and maraschino cherries. Everyone loved it.

I've been trying to recreate grandma's fluff salads for years and none of the recipes get close, they're always way too sweet. This one caused some problems the first time around. It tasted great, better than others so far,  but would not set. I don't know what went wrong but I made it again, exactly the same as the first time and it turned out great. I did swap out the lime jello for orange, cut the amount of marshmallows in half and substituted strained Greek yogurt for the sour cream. I think a drained can of mandarin oranges would have been a good addition and will probably add them next time.

This is good.  For those asking if you prepare the Jell-O, or complain it is soupy, no, you don't make the jello....  Just use the powder.  I have also made this with lemon jello.  Make sure to refrigerate a few hours before serving.   Mix all the ingredients except whipped cream.  Add that last and do not over fold it or it's not fluffy.

This green stuff is fanstasic!  Make sure you use a big bowl!  I thought it would never get eaten because there was so much but it was gone within days.  Wouldn't change a single thing!

A friend of mine calls this salad "The Exorcist Salad".  I guess because of the color and texture.  This is just ordinary tasting.

Made this for a church picnic and followed the directions exactly.  It was very good and would be good with about any flavor of Jell-o.  I will try orange next.

I needed a jello recipe for Thanksgiving and found this one!  Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe.  I made it the night before and it held up great overnight.
