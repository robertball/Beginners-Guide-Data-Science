This is a perfect recipe !  I made tiny cubes from a sour dough loaf, as well as from several slices of white bread.  I added cooked and diced maple flavored bacon and used half milk and half cream.  It was light, with the flavor of the corn shining through, the bacon providing just the right contribution and enjoyed by all.  I will make this again and again !  Thank you for sharing.

You can not begin to imagine how YUMMY this is !!!  Every year for Thanksgiving and Christmas Eve I have searched for the perfect Corn Souffle Recipe and I have finally found it.  I will never replace it.  Forget the recipes that call for Corn Muffin mix..  Yuck! I doubled this recipe to serve 25 and it came out perfect. Thank You So Much for Sharing !!!

Excellent, very easy to throw together from what you have on hand!  No fancy ingredients needed, made it just like the recipe and my family LOVED it!  This is an excellent dish, highly recommended and low-cost, would be good for a meatless meal to fill you up.

I'm rating this a 5 because my husband & father-in-law loved it. It was too sweet for me. Next time I am going to reduce the sugar. Thanks!

I'm impressed! My family loves the corn pudding my grandmother used to make and we have it at all holidays, but it uses heavy cream instead of milk so is much less healthy. This has a similar flavor but is definitely lighter and appropriate for dinner on a normal night.  I added salt and pepper and only used 2 slices bread because I've never heard of bread in corn pudding, and will leave it out completely next time. Will also use 1/3 cup sugar. Regardless, it was delicious and I will certainly make it often as a side dish or as a main dish served with salad and a side of pasta. Thanks for sharing a recipe that is a healthier version of one of my favorite foods!

I love corn pudding but made some adjustments to this one. I doubled the recipe and added a can of creamed corn and a can of regular corn. I used Townhouse crackers instead of bread. When I brought it to Thanksgiving, my family didn't know what to think since it isn't very pretty but by the end of the night it was gone.

I have used other corn pudding recipes from this site and this is the best so far.  The flavor, texture and consistency is so superior to the recipes using a box of corn bread mix.  It bakes up really nice, is lighter than the other corn puddings and is visually appealing.  Thanks!

This recipe was sensational! Definitely add the maple flavored bacon to the recipe as Tassel suggested...it adds just the right amount of saltiness to offset the sweet corn pudding. Would be great for brunch, or the day after a big event -- great as comfort food!

This is my 1st time either making or tasting corn pudding. I did enjoy it - ate 2 servings while 'tasting' it when it came out of the oven. I followed the instructions exactly with the one exception of reducing the sugar to 1/4 cup based on others' reviews/comments. I found that plenty sweet. (My guess is that canned corn contains more sugar these days than in earlier decades.)

I used whole wheat bread and canned, evaporated milk (3/4c with 1/4c water) just because that's what I had on hand. It came out perfect. I think it could use a pinch of salt, but adding that at the table worked fine. 

Next time I will experiment with adding a 2nd can of corn.  All in all, I enjoyed this dish. It takes only minutes to throw together and tastes great. A great way to use up stale bread. Huge thanks to Susan for sharing a beloved family recipe!

This is so quick to put together and uses only ingredients I'm likely to have on hand.  And it tastes good.

Good recipe to have on hand.  I accidentally overbaked and it got a little too dry.  I will make it again because it was worth it.

Kind of bland taste. I even added hickory smoked bacon, but think it could have used some diced green chiles to jazz it up.

This was just okay. I have had this verison of corn pudding many times. I was hoping this one would be wonderful. I think it's great for a classic, but I will keep looking for something with more flavor.
