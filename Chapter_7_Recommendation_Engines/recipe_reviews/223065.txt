The title, at least for me, was misleading.  I guess I have a completely different notion of what German Chocolate Cake is, so when I decided to try this unrated, unreviewed recipe, I focused on the "dark" in the title as well as the fact that the recipe called for a significant amount of cocoa. As this recipe's first reviewer, I prepared it exactly as written - no substituting coffee for the water, or any other changes, additions or substitutions.  What a cake. A perfect, moist, deep, dark chocolate cake. Have you tried and loved the top-rated chocolate cake recipes from this site?  This is right up there. (I made half a recipe into 18 cupcakes, baked at 19 minutes - pitch black, they were perfect for Halloween decorations!)

moist and delishious. The title was a bit misleading because it's a "German chocolate cake" so i expected a normal chocolate cake. What a wonderful surprise when I bit into this cake! Moist, flavorful, chocolatey. This recipe is worth baking!!

Im a Chocoholic at heart..and Oh My Gosh, this recipe does not dissapoint, it is fantastic! I decided to make cupcakes, this recipe made approx 44 regular sized cupcakes, filled 2/3 full. I did not change a thing ingredient wise. Very moist and delicious! I Piped around the outer edge with the Creamy Chocolate frosting recipe from this site and pipped a dollup of coconut/pecan German Chocolate frosting in the middle on top. Topped each cupcake off with a candied pecan piece and a drizzle of Chocolate ganache. Took 3 dozen to work for a bake sale and these recieved RAVE reviews from everyone! Thank you keklang for an awesome recipe!

This recipe creates a very moist and fluffy cake, but would definitely benefit from replacing the hot water with coffee instead. While tasty on its own, the cake does come out rather flat. It didn't sink, but it didn't exactly rise the way I expected it to, either.

Thoroughly impressed. I'm an avid baker with staple chocolate cake recipes that I've used throughout the years. I thought I'd try something different, and based on the reviews, this recipe was worth a test. 

It's not the traditional "German" chocolate cake, which is a very mild-tasting chocolate. This cake has a true, deep and dark color, along with a rich (but not overpowering) chocolate taste.

After mixing everything, the batter was extremely thin --- so thin that I re-traced the entire recipe to make sure I had used the correct amount of dry ingredients. It was right. I thought: "Well, here goes. Let's see if it rises."

It baked true to form and the texture is superb. I did not make a 14x17-inch cake. Instead, I made two 9-inch cakes and two 8-inch cakes with this batter (perfect amount). I'll freeze two cakes for use at a later date. 

Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Wonderful.  I could not be more pleased with this cake.  So good.  I made eighteen cupcakes and one 10 X 15 sheet cake. I've never used a mixer to whisk dry ingredients and suspected that they would fly all over me and the kitchen, but I did it, and they didn't!  BUT...I have a KitchenAid, with a deep bowl and the specified whisk attachment.  Not sure I would try that with a regular mixing bowl and hand-held mixer.  I used the frosting from Cinnamon Mocha Sheet Cake submitted by hobbyzu.  (I did decrease the cinnamon by one-half as my cinnamon seems to be really strong.)

This recipe makes an amazing, rich, dark, and very "chocolately" cake!  Love it...it's the only one I use now.  Beware that it fully doubles in the oven, so only fill cupcake or layer pans 1/2 full.  It makes a lot, so you can get three 9-inch layers out of it.

Although the cake was amazingly moist and very delicious, this recipe is not conducive to high elevation cooking. The cupcakes overflowed the cups and were hollow inside and the cake imploded. The whole middle of the cake just caved in. I recommend reducing the amount of milk, water and vegetable oil if you're going to cook this cake at higher elevations i.e. Denver/Boulder.

HIGH ELEVATIONER'S PAY ATTENTION! You need to cut down the amount of water you put into this recipe and add more flour. Otherwise they will sink in the center and flow over the edges.

Oh my gosh! This cake is amazing!  I love the taste of German chocolate frosting, but I dont like the lighter chocolate cake, I want a fantastic chooolate cake to go with my wonderful frosting, and I am so very happy that I have finally found it!  This is by far the moistest, best tasting homeade from scratch chocolate cake I have ever tasted!  I did use a regular cake pan 10x13 so it did take a little bit longer to bake but it was sooooo worth the wait!  Fantastic!

Delicious! I made half this recipe and half of another for cupcakes. These are so moist and delicious! I made them for a Birthday Party, but since it's almost Halloween, I decorated with Halloween/Fall decorations! I came out with 17 cupcakes (filled 'almost' to the top) and they baked for about 20-22 minutes. Delicious!

My teenage daughter made this for my husband’s birthday. He favors dark chocolates, so he really liked how intense the flavor was.  He called the recipe a superb choice. She had to bake it about 11 minutes longer than called for, so he feared it would be dry, but we’re still enjoying it a week later and are amazed by how incredibly moist it is.  We topped it with German chocolate icing, which I like to eat first before warming up the cake and topping with vanilla ice cream .  Yum, yum.

I’ve made a German chocolate cake every year for my mom’s birthday for several years now, and I always try a new recipe. This was hands down the best chocolate cake I’ve ever tasted, much less made. This will be the cake I make from now on!

I made this recipe and it’s delicious! The batter is a bit runnier than I’m used to but it came out perfect. I made cupcakes and had to cut the baking time to 20 minutes. Highly recommend for chocolaty cake.

Loved the dark chocolatey-ness of this cake!  Not too sweet & the perfect partner for a Pecan Coconut frosting.  I didn't have a 14x17 pan so I made a 13x9 (baked for 27 min), 6 regular sized cupcakes (baked for 18 min) & 24 mini cupcakes (baked for 10 min).  The only substitution I made was with the flour - it calls for 2 3/4 cups of all-purpose flour, but I used 2 cups of unbleached white flour & 3/4 cup of whole wheat flour.  I did this because my husband likes cake that is a bit more dense & not too spongy.  It came out perfect!  Will definitely make again!

Just made this cake, twice! Once with plain water and once replaced water with equal amount of coffee plus 1 tsp of espresso powder. The base cake is fantastic already that's very moist. But replacing the water with coffee with espresso powder definitely gave it a more complex flavor profile that'd make people go "omg this is awesome chocolate cake". 

The batter is very runny so no need to fret about that. It's important that the water/coffee is incorporated last with minimum mixing to minimize the amount of bubbles. Make sure to tap the pan to try to get some big bubbles out. I also waited a minute or so before putting in oven to give the bubbles a little time to surface. You'll still get some bubbles pooled in the middle during baking, but they're not that visible after baking is done.

Because it's a runny batter, make sure your oven racks are leveled as the cake is very prone to uneven rising.

This cake is so moist and delicious! The only change I made was cut the sugar down (per usual) from 3 to 2 cups. I'm always in search of a good, uncomplicated cake recipe from scratch. This one is not too dense and super moist and chocolatey. I used my Mom's tried and true German chocolate coconut filling with this to make a special birthday cake for my husband.

The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars was because I made some changes, which then made it a 5-star recipe (for me, anyway :-)   ).  I used full fat buttermilk which adds a moistness and tender crumb (nothing wrong with using regular milk, it's just a personal preference). 
also decreased sugar to 2 cups, instead of 3. Was plenty sweet and wonderful, and I used very dark cocoa.

This by far is the best chocolate cake I have ever tasted. It's moist (I love that word), decedent, and the perfect amount of chocolate. I made this for my mother's 67th birthday and everyone who ate it was in awe. I'm now making cupcakes with the same recipe for another bday.

Oh so nice and moist it melts in your mouth, and it doesn't need any frosting.

I replaced the hot water with coffee, but it still seemed to be missing something..

amazing as it is written, but adding hot coffee instead of water would only make it much richer.  Baked in convection oven at 325 in 8 inch pans.  Cake rose to nearly 3 inches high in each pan.  Baking time was 29 minutes.  Going to fill this with a homemade dark chocolate frozen custard and ice it with traditional german icing on top and a dark chocolate icing on sides for my father in laws 85th Birthday tomorrow.

This cake is BOMB!!!! Rises beautifully.  Layers freeze very well (though because of how moist it is...I suggest lining both sides with wax paper and then wrap thoroughly  in plastic wrap).  Yes...this IS..my new go to chocolate cake.  And I am giving five stars on both the original recipe as listed here (used first for my supervisors birthday cake I made for him) as well as my second making.  My alts were: using 2 tbsp of black cocoa powder for 'depth' & 1 cup of regular cocoa (both Hershey) and  1/2 cup of Kahlua 'infused' coffee and 1 cup of water.  Everyone needs this cake in their life.  GOD BLESS.

This recipe was fine, yet the cake still felt a bit underdone even after the thirty minute baking time. It tastes amazing with ganache icing. Everyone loved it!

I generally don't leave reviews but felt this recipe deserved one.  I'm not a huge fan of chocolate cake because it seems to be dry.  However, this cake was absolutely delicious.  My family loved it too.  Because it's in a large pan (pay attention to the pan size) it is a thinner cake.  Absolutely delicious.  I made it just as instructed and it was wonderful  but next time I'm going to replace the water with coffee and 1 tsp of espresso powder.

First time making this recipe; cake tastes amazing, but there was too much liquid in the batter. I had to bake for an hour.

I made these as cupcakes and the batter seems very thin, but it bakes up beautifully. Moist, very chocolatey.

Easily the best chocolate cake recipe I've come across. Very easy to make, super light and tender, deep chocolate flavor. Goes great with every frosting I've tried so far including German chocolate, caramel, cream cheese, and vanilla.

The two biggest issues I have are that it can be a little difficult to get the hot water to start incorporating and the final product is so tender it's almost fragile. 

The batter is very thin before baking, but bakes up beautifully.

Truly the best dark chocolate cake i've ever had. 
So moist and tender crumbs. Most excellent.  I did make a few changes as I saw a reviewer suggests, I used coffee in place of the water and used organic butter in place of oil. I used org as nic cacao powder. I also cut down on the suar.It will be my new go to recipe from now on. Thank you for sharing.

This got wonderful reviews from family and friends.  The cooktime for a 9x12 pan was closer to 50 minutes.  Be patient!  I might try coffee instead of Hot Water next time through.

This cake was so easy to make and really was extremely moist as others said. The only thing I changed was what pans I used and my pan prep. I used large and small bundt pans and prepped them with shortening and flour because I was out of parchment paper.  The large bundt took 35 minutes to bake and the small took 25 minutes. I will definitely use this delicious recipe again!

The absolute best chocolate cake recipe! (I can't say whether it is authentic German chocolate style or not). I have made it as listed, and also veganized, and it adapts well to using Ener-g egg replacer, using iced tea instead of milk, and if you want to ensure it's moist/richness add 1/2 cup mayonaise or Veganaise. Great with a classic frosting, or with a quick layer of jam or fruit preserves. So good and so flexible!

This is a yummy cake. Love the taste and  texture. Light fluffy Problem. It took 45 -50 mins to bake. I baked in 9 inch rounds. The cake did not fall but did pull in on the side of the pan when it cooled.

I'm not sure how this is turning out for other people.  As I was adding the water, I was thinking this is too much liquid.  The batter was like chocolate milk and took 1 and a half hours to bake.  If it tastes okay, I will definitely not add any of the water and would recommend if you try this recipe to not add the water at all.

This recipe was TERRIBLE! It was going fine until we added the water. At the end, the batter was so watery it looked like a big bowl of hot chocolate! Then when it came out of the oven, it was over flowing, and was still batter. Then we left it out for 2 hours and it shrunk and shriveled up. Also the batter was TERRIBLE! This recipe was a waste of time and food. In general, this recipe is the worst cake recipe out there. DO NOT TRY IT!!!

I used keurig for my water and it only shows water measurements in ounces and I thought thought weight ounces and not fluid ounces so I ended up with 24 ounces of water in my cake so I took half the recipe and added it back and I didn't have milk. So in the end I ended up using an extra egg, dark chocolate milk and a lot more of everything.

5 star + recipe.  It is our go-to chocolate cake recipe for any and every occasion.  I've made it at least 4 times now.  I use the dark red cocoa powder, which works for a luscious dark cake.  I have used black cocoa, but it is too dry.  Will continue to make this again and again!!

This is a great dark chocolate cake—not too sweet, decently chocolate-y, and nice and moist, especially right out of the oven. Mine was perfectly done in 25 min. I suggest frosting it with a cinnamon buttercream frosting, or having a slice à la mode with a scoop of vanilla or cookies and cream ice cream!
