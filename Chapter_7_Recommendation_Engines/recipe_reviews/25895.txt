These were fabulous! Everyone from Thanksgiving wanted the recipe. Followed exactly but next time I think I will cut the butter in half. Heres a hint to keep the potatoes from getting soggy in the crock. Lay a clean terry kitchen towel across the top of the crock then put the lid on. The towel absorbs the steam instead of it running back into the potatoes.

Using sour cream and/or cream cheese in these mashed potatoes was nothing new to me. I've always used one or the other or both but I also always use either russet or Yukon Gold potatoes rather than red skinned. What intrigued me was the idea (duh) of making them ahead of time and then reheating them in the slow cooker. I used the terry towel suggestion, as well as the suggestion to stir them every now and then to prevent them from browning along the edges. As others did, I simply forgot to put the butter in at the last, but with the gravy, the butter wasn't even missed. This method of preparation really eased the busy-ness and hustle-bustle in the kitchen on Thanksgiving day. I'm hooked...I will always make the mashed potatoes this way on Thanksgiving from now on! Thanks for a simple solution to getting rid of at least one step of the Thanksgiving meal preparation. Thanks too, to those of you with the helpful suggestions!

This recipe makes AWESOME garlic mashed potatoes when you use the Garlic and Herb Cream Cheese plus add garlic salt, oregano, and 1 cup of an Italian Cheese Blend - we were in heaven!! Thanks so much for a great idea... I will never make any other mashed potatoes again (whether I make Garlic or plain!!) I made mine three days early and refrigerated the stoneware crock until I was ready to cook them.

Oh my gosh...these potatoes were awesome!  And so incredibly easy.  Really a great "make ahead" recipe.  I made this in the morning and then put it in the slow cooker later in the afternoon so it was ready for dinner.  I used red potatoes with the skin on and they were great!  I too skipped the butter at the end (wasn't necessary).  FYI..I used a 3 lb bag of small red potatoes and this would be PLENTY for 6 adults for dinner.  3 hours on low in the slow cooker was perfect!  This one is a keeper!!!!!

Made potatoes the night before, warmed them up a little in microwave, then put them in crockpot for a few hours. Worked out very nice and everyone
said how nice it was to have hot mashed potatoes 
through the whole meal. Served it with BBQ ribs. Very good,will try it next Thanksgiving for sure!

Very easy to prepare, and even easier to eat.  The flavors in this dish combined very well, and tasted like no other mashed potato dish I've ever had.  And it STAYED HOT throughout the whole meal, which is a rarity for any kind of mashed potato dish that I've ever fixed.  One slight problem was that the potatoes didn't mash thoroughly, which left smallish chunks of whole potato in, but even that wasn't enough to detract from the overall experience.  (If you're particular about it, I would suggest running a mixer through it before placing in your Crock.)  I was pinched for time, and set the Crock on HIGH for 1 hour - they still tasted just fine, so I'm not sure 3 hours on LOW is necessary.  (Tip:  halve the time if you're cooking on HIGH - 3 hours on LOW equals 1 1/2 hours on HIGH, just a helpful thing to know when cooking with Crock-Pots.)  Excellent dish.  Thanks, Bwaye, this will be going into my regular rotation!

Very nice recipe! I make this recipe with light sour cream and light cream cheese. My husband tasted the potatoes before I added any butter and he said they were great as they were and since we were going to be serving them with gravy adding butter would make it too rich. I'll be making this again next week for Thanksgiving; I know it'll be a hit and best of all I won't have to be rushing around getting the potatoes ready while company is over. Thanks!
UPDATE (11/09):I have made this for each Thanksgiving since I first tried them, and they have always gotten many complements. For those that have wondered how much this makes volume-wise, one and a half recipes (so, 12 servings worth) fills up my 6 qt slow cooker. We serve it for 16 people at Thanksgiving and generally have some left over since there are so many other dishes on the table. I have used both red and russet potatoes and always leave the skin on, and it is very good both ways. Thanks again for a great, no-fail recipe!

YUM! Tasty but not overwhelming. It was so nice to be able to make these in the afternoon and load them into the crockpot to wait for my company to arrive later that evening. The only thing I'll change next time is to stir them periodically, since they seemed to brown around the edges by the time they were served.

Very good potatoes but rather heavy vs light and fluffy. 4 stars for ease, originality and time management.  Especially loved the idea of the terry cloth submitted by a reader.  Makes perfect sense!

I've been making these every holiday for several years and I'm always asked to bring the potatoes now, so they are obviously a hit! Like others, I most often use Yukon Gold, but red potatoes work well too. I increase the garlic to 3 Tbsp and I base the number of chicken bouillon cubes on how much water I boil the potatoes in. It's usually 9 cups or so, thus I use 9 cubes. It makes for a great flavor as the potatoes cook in the liquid. Also like others, I've forgotten to top off with butter and it is not missed at all except for the added calories!  This is a great way to free up my stove and oven and have one less thing to worry about during Thanksgiving or Christmas because I make these the night before, take out of the fridge about an hour before I turn on the slow cooker and they are hot and delicious (with occassional stirring!), in a few hours.

I love these, although I have stopped adding the butter at the end.  Seems like overkill, especially if you are serving gravy.

Wow...there are so many wonderful potato recipes on this site, I always have a hard time deciding which ones I'd like to prepare.  I usually like to add garlic oil to mine (fry garlic in veggie oil till golden).  It gives potatoes such a unique taste. The sour cream and cream cheese give a smooth and velvetty texture you can't acheive with milk and butter. Good recipe for company.  Thanks bwaye.

YUM!  For me, this is the perfect side dish for a big meal with all the trimmings.  It is so nice to have one less thing to do at the last minute when you're trying to get a big meal on the table.  These are absolutely delicious.  I made the recipe as-is, other than adding a bit more garlic.  HINT: if you want to save time on cleanup, invest in a box of slow-cooker liners.  The inside of the cooker gets pretty ugly with this recipe - it was very satisfying to be able to pick up that crusty bag and pitch it!

These were not a hit at our house.  Hubby said it was too rich, my 7 year old (who loves mashed potatoes) wouldn't eat them and I didn't really like the cream cheese taste.  I think I'll stick to my regular recipe but use the slow cooker idea.  Thanks anyways.

These turned out amazing.  I didn't expect such good results.  I was skeptical about the concept of the slow cooker.  I thought it would dry out the potatoes.  It did not.  It allowed for the flavors to meld.  I chose not to add the butter in the end because it didn't need it.   I also only used 2 bouillon cubes because I didn't want it to be over-salty.  These turned out perfect and needed no seasoning in the end.  Not even salt.  I will definitely make these again.

This is an awesome recipe for make-ahead mashed potatoes! I think that some of the cooks who gave this low reviews miss the point - this recipe and preparation aren't supposed to save you time. You do still have to peel, boil, mash, etc.... The point is: You don't have the last minute rush trying to make the mashed potatoes just when everything else is ready. You don't have to worry that your potatoes are ready too early when other things are still cooking, and might get cold before you put them on the table. You don't have to worry that you put your potatoes on a burner "just to keep them warm" and they end up scorching by accident. You can make these and take to a friend's or a potluck, and no matter what else is cooking, all you need is a little bit of counter space and a plug in. Plus, these are just really super tasty. I love my own traditional butter and milk mashed potatoes too, but this recipe is a close second... maybe tied since it is so nice to be able to make them ahead of time.  I took the suggestions to use a cloth towel in between crock and lid while cooking (also used when the crock was in the fridge overnight, before cooking). When I was mashing everything I was a bit worried because it was very runny... it didn't stay that way. I didn't add butter after cooking, because I thought they were rich enough, and didn't want to make them runny again.   Everyone loved them, and I will definitely make again.

I used "better than bouillon" to cut back on the sodium and low fat cream cheese.  I have to say I was amazed at how good these were.  I made them in the morning, refrigerated them, and then put them cold in the crockpot for a couple of hours.  I sometimes avoid making mashed potatoes when I am doing a big meal because there is so much last minute work.  No more!!  Great recipe!!

I've made these several times and have always been pleased.  I've never put them in a slow cooker, but rather I make ahead of time and just reheat quickly in the microwave.  I usually make half of this recipe which gives us six modest servings.  I usually freeze my leftovers and have them ready and waiting in the freezer for busy nights.  Occasionally the thawed potatoes get a little watery, so I heat them up in the microwave and then add some instant potatoes until I get the desired consistency.  Works like a charm!

Wow! This is definitely comfort food at it's best, but what really makes this recipe even better is the ease of prep and the fact that it can be made ahead of time.  Plus your oven is free for other things.  It's definitely not for those counting calories so I think I'll reserve this dish for the holidays when it's ok to splurge a little... Overall very tasty and a great recipe!

I have been doing this with mashed potatoes for years.  I also do the gravy in a small crockpot, and side dishes in various size crockpots.  All the work is done early, and the food will be nice and hot all the way thru the meal.  I even set up a table for them on the patio for barbeques.  I don't like lukewarm food that should be served hot and this keeps it all hot, even for the people that go for seconds!

FANTASTIC!  I made this recipe yesterday for Thanksgiving and it was a hit.  I used 10 pounds of peeled baking potatoes and doubled the other ingredients.  Every time I have tried to keep mashed potatoes warm in a crock pot, they have scorched.  Not with this recipe.  I forgot about the butter and didn't have enough on hand.  I ended up tossing 1/2 cube on the top and it worked great.  Dinner ran late so they ended up on low for 4 hours and they were still moist.  I have mashed potato duty for Thanksgiving from now on!

I like to make these the night before and heat them up the next day for Christmas dinner so I can spend time with people instead of cooking that day. I've never used the chicken bouillon, just used plain water. If you store them overnight in the pan for the crockpot, set it out in the morning to warm up at room temp so you don't break the crock in your crockpot going from cold to hot-- FYI!

Delicious! Made these to accompany tonight's roast chicken dinner. My hubs thought these were the BOMB and the best taters I've ever made! Although I don't completely agree (I'm still a sucker for plain 'ol mashed potatoes), I must admit, these are prolly the best "fancied up" potatoes I've had in a long while. I'll for sure serve BWAYE's potatoes when I want a special, make-ahead treat! NOTE: Feel free to use reduced-fat or fat-free dairy products. I used reduced-fat sour cream / ff cream cheese and STILL felt indulgent. :) NOTE #2: The towel trick really works (it prevents the water that condenses on your sc lid from dripping down into your potatoes, making them soggy). Stirring every now and then also helps prevent browning on the sides (if appearance matters to you - it doesn't affect the flavor in the least). Thanksgiving dinner will be EVEN better this year now that I found this recipe. :-) Thanks for sharing, BWAYE!

The dish itself was okay. Definitely nothing to write home about but it was all the work I had to do that makes me not want to give this more than 2 stars. When I saw the good rating, I had high hopes. I personally thought it was just like the box stuff. Didn't see any huge difference. And the fact that you have to cook the potatoes and mash them with other ingredients BEFORE putting in the slow cooker doesn't make any sense. Before I tried this recipe, I said to myself "Wait a minute, it looks like mashed potatoes are done in step #1.Then why put it in the slow cooker when it's already done? And then I thought MAYBE putting it in the slow cooker would actually make some difference in the flavor or something so I decided to give it a try. Nope, there's no difference at all in the flavor. I think I actually liked the flavor of "before slow cooker" better. It just doesn't make any sense that you make mashed potatoes and then put that done dish in slow cooker for more time. Why? It's just so redundant. Now I have one more big dish to wash and thinking of all the work and time I wasted to make mediocre mashed potatoes just upsets me so much.

I must be missing something here.  If you are going to cook first, why transfer them to a slow cooker, except to keep warm.  I had rather free up my slow cooker for something that will actually cook.

Such a great idea!!  Made this for Christmas dinner and it was a hit!  I put a towel between the lid and container also so not to make it too watery.  Will definately make again.

I tried this recipe after a friend of mine said that she uses slow cooker mashed potatoes all the time.  I looked on AR (my favorite recipe site) and found this recipe.  I didn't plan on using red potatoes but simple white ones.  I added more garlic only because we love garlic.  I made the potatoes two nights before just as I would make mashed potatoes, then put them in the fridge--I have to say, that I was very nervouse because I thought they tasted like instant potatoes.  When the day came, I put on the crock pot (approx 3 hours before dinner)and put my potatoes in the crock pot and put a towel over the top then the cover---oh wow---they were the best potatoes I have ever eaten!!!  WOW....I will definitely be using these for years to come to save time and to keep those tators warm!!!!  thank you!

This was fabulous as written. Everyone loved it and I had enough leftovers to make potato patties later in the week.  Instead of the red potatoes, I used yellow Yukons that I had on hand. As suggested by others, I laid a clean tea towel over the crock pot before putting on the lid and stirred the potatoes several times to keep the sides from browning. While stirring, I found they were too dry, so removed the tea towel about halfway through.  They turned out perfectly.

This was so good.  I love boiling the potatoes in bouillon and garlic- it adds such flavor!  I used boullion powder and just pressed two cloves of garlic, leaving them in large chunks so I could mash them up with the potatoes.  I used light sour cream, next time I will try light cream cheese too.  (Although it tasted wonderful, it was kind of heavy.)  I only had one red potato left, so I used that along with a bunch of Yukon Golds.    I cut the recipe in half and only added 2 TB of butter at the end, and it probably didn't even need any butter- it was so rich already!  I only added a few spoonfuls of the reserved water also.  Served this with Roast Sticky Chicken from this site.  I think I will make these for Thanksgiving this year!

Wonderful! The crock was scraped clean at the potluck we attended. I doubled the recipe and it fit perfectly in a 6 quart slow cooker. I made again for just my family, leftovers didn't taste like leftovers. I will
 add this to my permenant file.

I was SO hesitant about trying this recipe.  I am glad I did though.  Made it as is for my father-in-law's visit and it was a hit!  My husband ate so much of them he was ill. :-)  I love, love, loved the ease and hotness of having the potatoes in the slow cooker!  No more big mess right at dinner and no more cold spuds!  Thnak you for the recipe!  Oh and I did the towel under the crock pot lid and it worked quite well.

Great recipe - I usually add sliced green onions to the mashed potatoes before adding to the crockpot - just our personal preference - jazzes it up a little bit.  I have also had excellent luck doubling or tripling the recipe and freezing portions to just throw in the crockpot to heat up for another meal.  Love the ease of that!

Good spuds! And easy to do ahead; stays warm in crockpot. I used low fat cream cheese and sour cream, butter was the real thing; added at least 1/2 cup extra potato cooking water to make the right consistency. Cooked 1 1/2 hrs. on high in crockpot. The next day I added milk to make creamy as potatoes had become dry.

I left out the butter, used light sour cream, and 1/2 fat cream cheese and extra fresh minced garlic.  Prepared them the night before and put them in the crock the next morning for Easter supper.  They were fantastic.  Thanks

Wonderful!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I used low fat sour cream and cream cheese. Mine were a bit lumpy and I liked the consistency. I peeled half of the potatoes and left the rest unpeeled. Great Mother's Day side dish- my Mom wanted the recipe. Thank you!

I make these for Christmas dinner every year.  They are the best.  But to save even more time on the day of, I prepare them 2 days before, put them in the crock, refrigerate until Christmas morning.  Take them out a few hours before so to come to room temperature, cook on low until ready to serve.  Every one loves them.  Me...I love the early prep.  I even prepare my dressing (I don't stuff bird) the day before to save even more time.

I prefer my mashed potatoes to taste like actual potatoes. Instead, it ended up tasting more like sour cream and cream cheese. Doh!

So good and so much easier to have them ready to serve with dinner!
I agree with other commenters to put a towel over the top of the potatoes to prevent crustiness.

This is great!  I wasn't much of a cook until I discovered allrecipes.com and recipes like this make me look like a 5 star chef.  I added green onion and a small can of real bacon bits.  Then, when it was ready to eat, I put out real butter and shredded cheddar cheese to add on top.  Mix that all together and a little salt and pepper and it is like a twice baked potato without the hassle.  Loved this - its a keeper.  Thanks.

The suggestion of putting a towel under the lid of the slow cooker worked well.  This is a great recipe that allows you to make a head your potatoes. I also did not add all the butter at the end and they were still were great.

This recipe is so simple it is GENIUS! I made these for Thanksgiving dinner and was taking them to another home. I made them the night before and started the crock pot in the morning before we left. All we had to do when we arrived is plug the crock pot in. They were delicious and stayed hot for the entire meal!! Will definitely use this method again.

What's not to love about these potatoes?  They're rich, creamy, flavorful and just darn delicious!  I made 4 batches of these for Thanksgiving and only came home with a small bowl of leftovers.  Everyone loved them!

I'm a potato lover and have tried lots of different recipes -I thought this recipe was great! The 1st time, I followed the recipe exactly EXCEPT I inadvertently added the butter at the same time as the cream cheese and sr cream (oops) and it turned out perfectly anyway. I made these a second time with lite cream cheese, fat free sr cream & lite margarine and they were still absolutely delicious. Our company loved these, they stayed nice and hot, and cooking them longer this way, in the crock, gave them a great TEXTURE - creamy and light, almost like twice baked potatoes (without the potato skin "shell"). I will make these for every holiday because they're so good and so EASY. Thanks for the recipe.

Okay, I thought that these were alright, but I would have had a better chance at winning the Chicago marathon than passing these off to the "pickies" as a regular recipe (tee-hee).  No really, I thought that the flavor was good, however the kids mentioned that the sour cream overwhelmed the potato flavor in this recipe, and I agree.  I'll stick with my "basic mashed" recipe, gotta please the kids.  Thanks anyway Bwaye :)

Can I give this 10 stars???  I doubled this recipe for Easter Dinner.  I followed the recipe just as written, but I added 16 oz shredded cheddar cheese to the doubled recipe because I made ham and love cheesy potatoes with ham.  It was delicious!! All 18 people I served loved it.  My 2 year old great niece was dipping everything in them!!  Most ate seconds.  I had lots of leftovers, too. The best mashed potatoes ever!!!  They were delicious before I added the cheddar cheese!!!  These are definitely a new addition to my Easter menu.

These were FABULOUS! And I LOVE that they were made ahead of time and out of the way for the rest of the Thanksgiving day preparation. They are warm and ready to go when you are. Instead of fighting to keep them warm while making the gravy and rushing to get it all on the table at the last minute. Oh, and did I mention the flavor is FABULOUS?!? Thanks BWAYE for sharing! Edit/Update: Made these for Thanksgiving and they went over great! One person who despises gravy, sour cream and cream cheese asked over and over how I made them. I finally told him and he was very surprised! He said he loved them.

I made these for thanksgiving.  I kinda estimated the amounts and I used whatever white potato they had at the store.  Other than those changes, these were good mashed potatoes and its nice to let them sit in the crock pot and free up a space on my stove and not be mashing at the last second when I'm trying to finish dinner.  Just be careful about how hot your cooker is - they tend to burn/dry out around the edges if its too hot and its not stirred.

I've been making my "Make Ahead Mashed Potatoes" this way for several years..just make up the potatoes, place them into a baking dish and freeze! It's great for a dinner party, since you don't have to fuss with potatoes on the day of the event; just pop the dish into the oven, and the potatoes come out fresh as the day you made them! I use Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled, but that's just my personal preference..:) Enjoy!

I have made this recipe for years, howeveer instead of mashing the potatoes, I put them through a ricer.  Also I spray the crock with Pam before adding the potatoes.  I do not add the butter.

These were pretty good, but I have another recipe I like better. I used chicken broth to boil my potatoes in instead of the chicken boullion because it's what I had. Not sure what the point is of putting it in the crockpot-what was up against the pot actually burned. I would just mix it up when the potatoes are hot and then serve immediately next time.

Amazing! No gravy needed with these potatoes. Fattening, but very very tasty! And the best part, is they are done ahead of time so there isn't the usual mad scramble to get the mashed potatoes on the table with the rest of the meal.

I can't really rate this recipe because of my own fatal mistake.  Please learn from me and DO NOT make these too far ahead of time.  I made these at 8:00a.m.(thankful to get them out of the way and concentrate on my guests and the rest of dinner) and served at 3:30.  Instead  of gorgeous mashed potatoes I served a soupy starchy paste. waah!  I will try again though.  They sounds wonderful.

I rarely disagree with the majority around here but this recipe is the exception.  Way to much for for no payoff.  I followed the recipe to a T & these potatoes were soso & bland at best.  Cooking them in the crock pot did absolutely nothing to infuse flavor.  If you boil potatoes in plain water & mash them with cream cheese & sour cream they will taste the same.  There is no need to waste your 2-3 hours for them to cook in the crock pot.  The chicken bullion also added nothing.

If you have to  boil the potatoes on the stove anyway, I don't understand the point of the crockpot.  Besides, the end result was just average.

I used Yukon Golds instead of red potatoes, chicken broth instead of the bouillon & water, and added cheddar and green onions to make them like twice-baked potatoes.  I really like the idea of boiling the potatoes in chicken broth and fresh minced garlic...it gave the potatoes an unbelievable flavor!!  I didn't add any additional moisture to the mashed potatoes, but I think next time I might add some milk at the very end with the butter (I actually forgot to add the butter...they weren't bad but I will remember to put it in next time!!).  On a normal day, I would agree with most of the reviews saying that the crock pot is probably unnecessary...but on Thanksgiving, you need all the extra help you can get and these work out perfectly for the big day.

These were the best mashed potatoes I've ever eaten in my ENTIRE life.  And that's an understatement.  I made them last year for a Christmas Eve party and they disappeared in under 6 minutes!!  I wish I'd made more.  Now I'm making them for a Independence Day BBQ!!

These potatoes were a big hit at my house.  They're great because you can get them in the slow cooker and you're free to tend to the rest of the meal.  The biggest plus though is that they are truely melt in your mouth.  I will never make mashed potatoes by peeling, boiling and mixing ever again!!!!!!  These are GREAT!!

Honestly, not sure why anyone wouldn't make these??  Not only are they AMAZING, it frees up your kitchen the closer you get to turkey time.  We make these in place of any other mashed potato for all occasions!  Only change we make is substitute garlic/chive cream cheese for original and add more garlic. We also use Better Than Bouillon which I believe adds so much more flavor then traditional cube bouillon.

Absolutely great. Made it for Thanksgiving . What a time saver. I did not peel the potatoes. I used Yukon gold potatoes. I made it the night before then heated in crockpot for 3 hours . My son in law who is very picky even liked them & thought I was soo smart for fixing them this way.

I love this recipe!  The flavors are great.  It is so nice to skip the potato peeling and have the potatoes ready and waiting when dinner comes together.  No hurry, scurry and dirty dishes left in the sink making the mashed potatoes at the last minute. But best of all they are so good that my family even loves them warmed up for leftovers.  A first for mashed potatoes at our house. You will love making this for family gatherings, church potlucks and just plain old family dinners.

I decided to try this recipe looking to ease the typical turkey dinner work load. As such, I prepped it the day before and kept refrigerated until time to start warming. I was a bit worried as the amount of cream cheese and sour cream seemed overwhelming and, fresh out of the cooking pot, they did make the potatoes very rich and 'saucy' (I didn't even need to use any of the cooking water), but the slow cooking process mellowed them just enough. They didn't seem to need the butter stirred in at the end, so I left it out. This recipe, along with a slow cooker stuffing, made my turkey dinner a breeze. Thank you!

Honestly, for all the calories that are in it, I was disappointed.  Maybe because I did forget a few things...I forgot to add the garlic and also left out the chicken bouillon to accommodate my vegetarian guests. I also didn't add the full recommendation for butter at the end because I ran out, so maybe I added 2 Tbsp in stead of 1/2 cup.  

So, just with the sour cream and cream cheese and a little bit of salt & pepper, it left it tasting rich but bland (is that possible?!)

I like the idea of using the crockpot to save time, but really, what's the real point, if you're doing everything you normally would to mashed potatoes (adding the extras and mashing everything up) after boiling the potatoes and just sticking it in the crockpot to keep it warm? It takes the same amount of time...

In the future I'll just stick to my usual milk/salt/ and lots of butter routine. Maybe I'll try the chicken bouillon next time, it does sound yummy, but I'll leave out the cream cheese.

This recipe is fantastic!  I made these potatoes for Thanksgiving and my sister and I gobbled them up!  The only change I made was I used russet potatoes instead of red and added a bit more garlic.  I will be making this recipe again!

This is an EXCELLENT recipe for mashed potatoes!  I wouldn't change it up except to add the butter, salt and pepper the last 30 minutes of slow-cooking time.  I used a beater to mash the potatoes before putting it in the slow-cooker just because I like mine mashers smooth/no chunks.  Also, I used 3/4 of a 16 oz. container of sour cream and therefore didn't need to add any reserved liquid from boiling the spuds.  No need to peel the potatoes either. The skins give it extra flavor. Well done!

Very good, but I did cut back on the sour cream, cream cheese and butter (I used 1/4 cup of each one). Otherwise, I think it would have been much too rich for my family's tastes. I also skipped the bouillon cubes (I don't like the flavor of them or all the sodium). When mashing the potatoes, I did add a bit of low sodium chicken broth to get the desired consistency. But by adjusting to suit our tastes, it was a huge hit and I love the idea of using the slow cooker to make ahead of time and keep warm - brilliant in its simplicity!!

Great recipe for mashed potatoes!! It will fill a 5 quart crock pot...I feed 12 with a little left for hubby and I the next night. I didn't have the problem with the edges being brown in the crock pot, just keep it low and no problem. I also added about 1/4 cup of the liquid which I felt kept the potatoes moist and they were in the crock pot for about 4 plus hours.For over 30 years I have only made my  mashed potatoes from scratch...never from a box and this is the only way to go, it will save you time and keep those potatoes hot and fluffy. I thought making them by keeping the skin on would take away from the texture and flavor not a chance. Everyone loved and asked for the recipe. Thank you for sharing.

These were sooo rich and yummy! Easy, too! I used veg broth, and whole garlic cloves, which I then mashed with the potatoes. I turned the slow cooker to warm after two hours, because the cheese/sour cream on the sides was starting to brown even on low. This is how I'll make mashed potatoes from now on!

I make this for Thanksgiving and EVERYONE loves it. It's so great because you can free up the stove and oven, and keep your potatoes warm right up until you eat!

You really cannot go wrong with this!  This is the perfect combination of flavors.  I used the towel under the crock pot lid...it worked great keeping the extra moisture under control.  I loved how warm these were.  I'm really not sure how people have problems making these...it's common sense.  You reserve a little bit of the water to use to get these to a creamy consistency while your mashing them.  If you put too much of the reserved water in....well your going to have bad results I would imagine.  Loved this recipe.  This was complimented on over and over at thanksgiving...give this a try!

This turned out wonderful.  Great for a large gathering or the holidays.  Next will try using fat free sour cream and fat free cream cheese to cut back on the calorie intake.

These were very good and my daughter who does not like mashed potatoes loved them. I did leave out the cream cheese and lessened the sour cream and they were delicious.

This was a great recipe.  I quadrupled the recipe and used 20lbs of potatoes and made them for my son's communion party and they gobbled them up.  I made them up the day before and the next day put them in the crock pot and put a couple of pats of butter on top and they turned out great.  This is a great recipe to use if you are having a party!  Thanks for sharing.

Very good! This makes the type of mashed potatoes that are fluffy and light. I prefer chunky mashed potatoes, but these are really good, too. These are rediculously fattening. I used regular cream cheese, regular sour cream, and pure butter. Delicious, but I don't want to know what my cholesterol is after eating these. Overall, 4 stars, but I have made mashed potatoes that I like better than these (and less fattening!).

These were excellent.  They had a very rich taste and were very easy.  I will be making these again specially for family dinners where I don't want to fool with mashing potatoes at the last minute.

I make this so much easier and much better flavor by putting all my ingredients at one time in the slow cooker, except NO water!  I layer my cream, butter, potatoes, 3 triangles of spreadable cheese,  4 oz. cream cheese, salt & pepper, garlic (if you like), then repeat layers. If I need more liquid, I add heavy cream mixed with chicken or vege broth. I only have to check on and stir 2 -3 times while cooking on low either overnight or during the day. You will get the richest real potato flavor because you are not pouring off the potato starches. And those brown edges around the edge, stir them into the potatoes. Adds yummy richness. You will truly taste a huge difference in the potato flavor! I have recommended this recipe to so many of my family and friends and they absolutely love it. In a hurry? Use your pressure cooker!   Enjoy!

I used about 3 pounds of red potatoes, Philly cooking creme- the roasted garlic flavor, 1/3 of a container of fat free sour cream and added an onion to the cooking water. YUM! The flavor was great! 
Instead of putting these in a crock pot, I baked them in a 350 degree oven for about 20 minutes to warm them and get a crust on top. The family raved!

A good way to make mashed potatoes ahead of time.  I will definitely make again, but may try to add more seasoning or cream cheese.  I felt they were a little bland.

Um, I misread the ingredients and only used 3 pounds of potatoes, so it was really thick and creamy. Even with five pounds of potatoes, I might consider cutting down the sour cream and cream cheese. I put it on high for about an hour and then turned it to low for another 20, and it turned out pretty well. I didn't use the butter since it was so creamy. I did use a towel on top of the crock pot under the lid to absorb the moisture, but it wasn't very wet, so I'm not sure if it did anything. I also stirred half way in to prevent it from sticking to the side. Great recipe, I think.

I paired this with Glazed Meatloaf1 from this site.  My whole family loved it!  My husband even ate half of my plate before going to work!  I did boil the potatoes with chichen broth and reduced to 1 chicken boullion. Used fat free sour cream and cream cheese and light Land o Lakes butter to cut calories.  Once boiled, doesn't take more than 1/2 hour ro cook through.  Using a mixer before transferring to the crock pot helps smooth it out.  I also added seasoned salt to taste because I felt it needed more salt.( didnt salt the broth as it was boiling)

I did the crock pot method a few years back. When it came time to serve the potatoes, I had potato soup. The entire batch had liquified. I may have left them on too long. I thought I was brilliant preparing the potatoes the night before. I can't say how long they were in the cooker. Keep an eye on them.

Really good flavor, but it did get runny when in the crockpot, even tho I put a towel over it to catch the condensation.  I will try again but without putting it in the crock.

I made these for a Christmas buffet, and was very dissatisfied with them. The taste wasn't bad, but I have made baked version of this potato that are nice and thick. These turned out very liquidy and spread right on the plate. I don't know what happened? I followed the directions exactly, and I didn't even add any extra liquid. They did thicken up once cold, but how many people eat cold mashed potatoes? Plus, I tried later to use it in a potato casserole and it just spread again and all the grease in the potatoes was floating all over the casserole. I depend on leftovers, to make other meals out of. It really is a lot of fat, anyway overall, for some lightly flavored mashed potatoes.

I didn't care for this recipe, but iit wasn't horrible.  Although the sour cream and cream cheese did make for creamy potatoes, I found the flavors to be overpowering.  I prefer to taste the potato flavor too!

Very good - I added in 1/4 cup of shredded parmesan cheese and used seasoned salt instead of standard salt.  The "melded" flavors were wonderful!  I'll be making these for Thanksgiving!

Fabulous!  Followed recipe to the letter, I whipped the potatoes before putting them in the slow cooker.  EVERYONE commented and I had NO leftovers.  I made a special dinner for my mother's 80th birthday, thank you all for your recipes the night was a total success!

I added some garlic powder and onion powder, but other than that I followed the recipe.  I really enjoyed it, but the bf still wasn't wowed.  He's pretty picky though.  Make sure to stir the potatoes every once and awhile and I put a cloth under the lid, which worked well.  I think I'll keep playing with the ingredients, but keep this as a base recipe since I liked it.  Thanks for the recipe :)

I made these mashed potatoes for Thanksgiving and it was a hit—everyone loved it! I might try some of the reviewers ‘lower fat version’ the next time because I am sure that with the cream cheese & sour cream, this is a fairly unhealthy recipe. I should have followed what the others said about stirring often as my mashed potatoes browned on the side. It didn’t mess up the dish though; I just scrapped the sides, discarded most of the brown, and stirred it up. After doing this, none of the brown was evident. Delicious!

I will never make other mashed potatoes again! These were *SO* good! I followed the recipe exactly, I just didnt add butter at the end because it wasn't needed. These potatoes have a wonderful fluffy texture and smooth creamy taste. If you have a large family and are making this for the Holidays I would atleast make 1 1/2x more or double it. Loved being able to make this at home, bring it to a family members house, and not take up their oven once there. Make these now!

I used chive and onion cream cheese...loved the kick of flavor! Didn't have to peel the potatoes, and only mashed until slightly lumpy for texture. I didn't add butter, salt or pepper in the end because they seemed almost too flavorful from the cream cheese. I was hesitant when I took them from the fridge after 2 days and added to the crock pot, but they turned out amazing!! I stirred in the crockpot about every half hour to maintain smoothness, my first christmas dinner turned out amazing!!

Use this recipe every Thanksgiving.  We have at least 14 people every year, so I try to make as much as I can.  I usually can fit about 8-9 lbs of potatoes in my crockpot.  I usually add a little more cream cheese and sour cream b/c of the extra potatoes and extra garlic in the boiling water and chicken broth.  I have a wheat allergy so i find it easier to use chicken broth without wheat starch or msg and just add a large can or box of broth to the water.  I use my hand mixer as I found out my stand mixer is too small for all those potatoes.  I have found two hours is perfect so you don't get the brown edges and like the suggestion of just stirring once in awhile.  I also have noted that the potatoes thin a little when cooking but didn't have a problem with that this year, but the towel idea is a good one too. Our favorite part about these potatoes is they stay warm the whole meal.  love it!

It just gets better and better each year! To fill my round crockpot, I use 5lbs of Russett potatoes.  The morning it is to be served, I add pats of real butter and pour in some milk and stir & set it on low for 3-4 hours. This year I used whole milk and it made a world of difference--we usually have only non-fat milk in our house.

Whenever a mashed potatoe recipe is to be held pending guest arrival or serving large groups, I "save the water in which potatoes" are cooked & then add potatoe water as needed in order for the potatoes to keep soft & fluffy or not dried out.

I made these for our dinner last night--amazing! It was a hit across the board with all our Thanksgiving guests!  I used the chive and onion cream cheese, mixed in freshly shredded parmesan cheese, fresh chives, and oregano, and then laid a towel under the crock pot lid to collect the extra moisture. When time to serve, I beat them once more and topped with a few more chives and fresh parmesan for looks. Enjoy!

If you've never made your mashed potatoes with cream cheese, BEWARE!  The cream cheese changes the texture of the potatoes, you feel like you are eating glue. Never again.

The ultimate in convenience coupled with taste--this recipe's a keeper!  Hint: Since you're using the slow cooker anyway, cut up the taters and put them into the slow cooker, add the broth, and let them cook themselves.  When they're tender, proceed with the rest of the recipe.  I made this to feed 32 people (no, it didn't all fit in one slow cooker)--good stuff.  I also left out the butter, as the taters were really rich.  I froze the leftovers and, re-cooked, they still taste great.

Great recipe...I made ahead and put potatoes in a slow cooker bag and stored overnight in the fridge.  Easy to make and even easier to clean up. I stirred the potatoes while in slow cooker, left out the butter, and added milk (instead of water) only as needed.

Very good.  I liked the potatoes before the butter was added so I put them out as is and had butter available for those who like buttery potatoes. So nice to have hot potatoes all the way through the meal.

These potatoes were to die for!!  I absolutely loved them!  Everyone else loved them as well.  My sister went back for 3rd helpings (and she usually barely has 1 helping)!!  The only complaint we had about this recipe was the appearance.  The potatoes looked a little runny, but they were delicious.  Next time we make these I think we will try to "whisk" them a little more.  Great dish!!!

This is an awesome recipe.  It is absolutely yummy.  I had guests over for dinner and I thought I made too much.  No way the bowl was empty and scaped out.  Every one loved it.  One of the best things about this recipe is that you can put the stuff in the crock put and put it in a corner out of the way so you can do other things.  Excellent recipe.

These potatoes were wonderful -- my daughter ate them even though she despises all potatoes except fries.  I used half the amount of butter called for, and they were still very creamy and flavorful.  However, like some reviewers have said, they did indeed taste better to me as leftovers the next day (although there wasn't much leftover after my husband got done with them).  Thanks for the recipe!

What a hit! We doubled the recipe as we were cooking for a crowd. Super easy once you get the potatoes cooked and mashed. I used my Kitchenaid and it was a breeze. Definitely follow the recipe, but you can leave out the butter and won't know the difference. Will definitely make these again. In fact, I froze some leftovers and they heated nicely in the microwave for dinner a couple of weeks later. I'll make these by the batch and freeze portions for small family dinners. Perfect!

While its true this recipe takes a little pre-planning, it isn't difficult. What you have when finished is a wonderful sidedish that just about everybody will love. And it leaves you with some extra time to spend making the salad or setting the table. Thanks for the recipe and the extra time, bwaye.

This recipe was excellent.  Prep work can be done ahead of time instead of mashing potatoes
at the last minute.  The potatoes were white and creamy and just as flavourful as the best
restaurant potatoes.  I didn't use the butter and I didn't miss it since they have so much flavour.
I left about 1/2 the skins on and it made a pretty contrast.  This is definitely going to be a standby
recipe.

If you have limited space and you're making a big dinner, make these! They tasted amazing and it was extremely convenient to make them early and let them finish on their own out of the way in a crock pot. They were a big hit with my Thanksgiving guests!

Love this recipe!  I cook for 15 on Thanksgiving and roast 2 turkeys with 2 types of stuffing.  I need my stove and my wits about me so I appreciate any help to make it better and easier.  I double this recipe and make it the night before so all I have to do in the morning is get it out, let it sit for an hour or so to warm, then put it in the crock pot for 2-3 hours with occasional stirring and adding left over juice. I've never needed the butter.  Thank you so much for this recipe!!

Oh wow!  This recipe is absolutely delicious!!!  I will not go back to fixing mashed potatoes like I did years ago!  I think cooking the potatoes in the chicken bouillon water is the secret!  This mashed potato dish last several days and can be reheated after the first serving. I peel the potatoes,cut into chunk size (for cooking) and keep the potatoes covered under water in a big bowl. I then placed the bowl in the refrigerator (to keep from browning) the night before making this dish to cut down on preparation time.  Drain the refrigerated water off the potatoes when ready to cook and then prepare recipe in a crock pot as instructed.   Stir occasionally!  This recipe is so easy as a crock pot side dish. Especially easy for Thanksgiving meal.

I was super excited about trying a new mashed potato recipe and the slow cooker idea.  However...  I found the flavor to be very bland, which given the presence of sour cream, cream cheese and garlic, I was surprised.  Milk does the same job as the cream cheese and sour cream (and a tad bit healthier too).  The slow cooker as a warmer is still a good idea (so I can make them ahead of time) but on the whole not very impressed.

Delicious for our Thanksgiving meal and so nice to make ahead!  

I used 10 pounds of Russet Potatoes.  Followed the recipe part of the way, however, I cut out lots of unwanted fat grams.  The garlic and broth makes a wonderful flavor.  I did use one can of reduced soduim chicken broth instead of the 3 cubes.  

(When potatoes are ready for draining... SAVE the water flavor for your gravy.  It really adds a nice taste.)  

I beat the potatoes with only 2 cups of reduced sour cream and flavored with salt and pepper.  

Refrigerated overnight, the next day I warmed them slightly in the microwave, and placed in a crock pot on low stirring them once in a while.  

Using a terry cloth towel between potatoes and lid does help keep the water drippings off the potatoes when lifting up the lid as someone else suggested.  

Add your gravy to the potatoes and you have one awesome tasting side dish!!!  This recipe is a keeper.

I always make the potatoes the night before using a recipe similar to this.  The only difference is... I add a packet of dry ranch dressing mix.  It adds great flavor!

These are so good! I was planning on making them for Thanksgiving. Then out of the blue I decided to make potatoes-- I never make potatoes! So I tested out this recipe before the big day. I used 1/2 of the potatoes, 1/2 of the other ingredients, and broth instead of boullion cubes. Somehow my potato masher had disappeared (probably ran away to someone who would actually use it) so I whipped the ingredients together with my mixer. Everyone raved! I will have to make these frequently! And get a new masher. Can't wait until Thanksgiving!

A great way to free up your stove during a busy Thanksgiving/Christmas day in the kitchen. 

Try adding a chopped up celery root to the pot while boiling the potatoes and mash right in with them afterwards for a tasty and subtle flavor boost. (remove stems and peel first) 

Enjoy an extra glass of wine with friends with the time saved on the big day. --Don't forget to toast your secret pal the slow cooker!  ;)

The concept of having a side dish in the crockpot is a good idea for family holiday meals so I decided to try this recipe.  It will be good for future holiday meals with a few tweaks.  I think you have to remember that for a crockpot or slow cooker to work well, it needs to be 1/2 to 2/3 full.  Less than that and it overcooks, and more than that it won't get hot enough.  Well, I had too much in my crockpot so it didn't get hot enough and the center was really cold.  I didn't realize this until it was close to meal time.  Next time I will only fill the pot to 2/3 full.  Also, when I started the turkey that I served with this, I put a foil pack containing a whole bulb of garlic drizzled with olive oil.  I cooked this until soft and added it to the potatoes instead of the minced garlic.  Either works, I just prefer the flavor of the roasted garlic.

A quick history of me: I'm weird. I love my starches and when I go out to eat, I frequently propose to good mashed potatoes. I am a good cook but I have never made mashed potatoes that I wanted to run away with.

I want to have these every day ever. These are the greatest mashed potatoes I have ever eaten. Original poster of this recipe: You don't know me, but I want you to know I love you for introducing me to this beauty of a recipe!

This recipe was very good. I used no fat sour cream and low fat cream cheese and only used 2 tablespoons of butter at the end but it tasted great. I also used the kitchen towel over the crock pot to let the steam through but not let the water back in, great idea! Next time I'm going to try to incorporate cheese into the recipe for a little extra kick. Definitely will make again.

I made these the day before Christmas and we had them on Christmas day.  They were wonderful and it was so nice not to be making them when doing everything else.  Did not have to add any of the liquid.

Pretty easy . . .makes a ton!  On the bright side, it definitely fills a smaller slow cooker and would fill at least half of my bigger one, which is always important when you are using slow cookers.  I think mine were a bit sloppy bc I got a little too enthusiastic with the liquid.  Not sure I'm a fan of putting bullion and garlic in the boiling liquid, though; I didn't notice much garlic or chicken flavor, so I would leave the water just salted next time.  otherwise, this is a good way of making mashed potatoes and keeping them warm until ready to serve.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made these for a work Thanksgiving gathering and since I work at 8am and the luncheon wasn't held until 12pm, this recipe could not have been more convenient! I refrigerated the potatoes overnight, then placed them in a slow cooker on my desk until lunch...they were absolutely awesome and I'm glad I was one of the first in line, because rumor has it that these had completely disappeared before the 10th person in line made it up!! I did use the garlic cream cheese, so I omitted the garlic when cooking. Also, I did NOT place a terry cloth over the slow cooker, as I personally didn't mind a little extra moisture - I figured it may even keep the potatoes from drying out. I will be making these again for Christmas dinner on Friday night, and I think rather than salt that I will add a pinch of garlic salt for a little extra flavor, as well as green onion, which I think will go excellent with these. Thanks BWAYE for a great recipe!

The cream cheese is a little too much, in my opinion. I would cut it by half at least. Also, boil the potatoes in bouillon if you want, but discard it afterwards and use chicken broth to attain desired consistency instead.

Great way to free up time, stove and/or oven space. These potatoes turned out terrific. I skipped the butter at the end, as we had them for Thanksgiving and there was gravy, but truthfully, they were tasty without it. The towel between the top and the crock was a great idea, as there was quite a bit of condensation. Will use this recipe again and again.

Made for Thanksgiving, Ive always only done traditional way of making them, so I was a little skeptical!  The recipe is sooo very easy, so easy you might think you missed a step.  The texture was great, color was great...flavor? not great!! Not the recipes fault though!  I added an entire 16 oz container of sour cream rather than the 8 oz the recipe calls for.  It gave it a much too sour taste, but still edible.  I didnt save any of the leftovers, just wasnt worth it.  I can totally see this being my go-to recipe if next time I only use half the container of sour cream!  Def recommend and will make again.

This worked out REALLY well!  I used it for thanksgiving because I was making the taters and taking them to my s-i-l's house which is at least 20 minutes away. It kept them warm and I didn't have to "fight" for oven or stove space for them.  They were really yummy and I got a lot of compliments on them.  The left overs were really good with baked potatoe toppings; it made them like twice-baked potatoes.

Great idea! This was the best way to do mashed potatoes on Thanksgiving. They were done and hot so we didn't have to worry about them at the last minute when there was gravy to do. I followed the recipe even though I'd never made mashed potatoes without milk before today. They were very smooth and yummy. I forgot the butter and salt and pepper at the end but it was OK because we had gravy. Make sure you stir them or leave in the crock pot for less time. Mine hardened around the sides of the crock.

Made them exactly like the recipe states except I only had sour cream with chives in it. My husband ate the heck out of them. Said they were the best he's ever had! I tasted them before adding the butter at the end and they were delicious, but my mom would be proud of the 2 big tablespoons I dropped in there before turning off the crock pot. I absolutely adored them, and will certainly be making them again! Thank you!

I thought they were good but not much better than any other mashed potato recipe I've tried. it was nice to be able to leave them in the crock pot and the consistency was great from when they ready until the next day when i reheated them. I will make again if i'm on a time crunch.

Very good.  Served for guests and it was so nice to have this side dish all done ahead of time, just waiting to be eaten.  Though, I just realized when I went to write this review, I left off the last minute step of adding butter... whoops!  By the way, it serves way more than the 8 people listed as part of the recipe.  I'd say it serves at least 12 or more.

I accidently cooked the red potatoes completely, didn't reserve the water drained...again in a hurry and not reading the recipe. However did everything else the same including using a towel under the lid to absorb moisture and they were so creamy...we didn't even use butter. I did use 1/3 fat cream cheese and Daisy light sour cream to cut calories...after cooking on low for three hours just left on warm...first time no leftover mashed potatoes at Christmas dinner...thanks.

We made these for Christmas and they were excellent.  I made them the right conistency before putting them in the slow cooker so they were really runny when we served them.  Next time, I will leave them a lot thicker.

These were as good as everyone said they were!  I opted to halve the sour cream and they were in the pot all day and were delicious and piping hot a dinner time.  A  life saver on holidays. The tip about the tea towel worked great.

These are the best mashed potatoes! I've been making them for a couple years now and only had one mishap with too much liquid which made them not quite a soup. I have also made these with white potatoes and they turn out just fine.

This is great! I have always used red potatoes, skin on and sour cream, garlic and butter. This time, I added cilantro, green onions, real bacon bits, basil and sage.   I didnt add the cream cheese, didnt think it was needed. Butter can be added or not, its so good without it!   Stirred occasionally and let others decide to add cheese or not!  LOVE IT!

I used russett potatoes and these were YUMMY! Will always make Thanksgiving this way. Didn't taste the garlic in them though so maybe will add more next time. Make sure you mix the potatoes periodically in the crock.

These were a big hit.  It was great to free up the stove.  I was afraid that they would dry up, and they never did.  They stayed very hot.  I actually prepared the night before and then just turned on the crockpot the next day.

These were excellent. I consider myself an accomplished cook but I always seem to have watery mashed potatoes. This recipe not only helped me out in the chaos of Thanksgiving day cooking, but also resulted in the most lovely creamy and fluffy potatoes. I did double the recipe but found I needed about 1 cup of milk to make them less stiff. Also did the towel trick others suggested and that worked brilliantly.

These potatoes are fabulous just as they are!! I may have been generous with the minced garlic because I LOVE garlic! Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and they are the best potatoes I have ever had. They are very easy to prepare as well. After boiling, I put the potatoes in my KitchenAid along with the butter and cream cheese. Let them soften a bit, then blend them. Just awesome! A family favorite that I will make again and again! Thank you for sharing.

These were the best!  I boiled the red potatoes whole until tender, then removed the skin.  (very easy this way)  I did not have sour cream on hand so I added whole milk to taste.  I also melted the butter and warmed the milk while mashing potatoes. These had a wonderful creamy consistency.  Will never use another recipe for mashed potatoes again.  This is it!

These worked out great the first time but the second time I made them they were in the slow cooker longer than I expected and they turned brown and had a burnt taste.  Make sure you spray the inside of the crock with spray so they don't stick and only keep warm in there for about 2 hours.

This is sooooo good. My DH does not eat cream cheese OR sour cream, so I went a little light on both ingredients... used half of the sour cream and 3/4 of the cream cheese, then splashed in a little fat free half n half to make sure it wasn't dry. Used russet potatoes instead of red and it was great. Got rave reviews at a big dinner... my guests had never heard of a crock pot mashed potato recipe and I think they were worried the potatoes would get mealy or something... they were outstanding! Thanks for this recipe, it's a keeper!

This was so delicious! Everyone kept coming back for more! Boiling the potatoes in bouillon cubes and with the garlic really gives it some extra flavor. Do not skip this step. Quite frankly, you could even serve these mashed potatoes without putting them in the slow cooker, but I did it anyway just for giggles. Do as the other individual suggested and use a terry cloth between the pot and the lid, or it WILL become soggy. I will make this again!

Definitely a great recipe, best way to keep them hot, and loved the idea of using a kitchen towel-a must!  As a note, I've made the 'holiday, I'm cheating version,' which follows this, and I've made the healthier version using low fat ingredients and it still tasted amazing!

Delicious! I also did not use the slow cooker, and I used reduced fat sour cream, reduced fat garlic and herb cream cheese, and 1/4 cup of butter, just to cut the calories a little. Oh, and I omitted the garlic in the cooking water since the cream cheese had garlic in it already. It did not reduce the great taste of these potatoes however, and I think this is such a keeper! My husband and kids all raved, these are so good! Will definitely be making them again!

This was really good but there were some problems.  I followed the recipe pretty closely except I added a couple of teaspoons of oregano.  As for the problems, first, the garlic taste is very weak.  If you like the taste of garlic, you'll need to add some raw garlic to the final product.  Also, I made the potatoes the day before serving and they were absolutely delicious right after being mixed with the cream cheese and sour cream (I creamed the cream cheese and sour cream together first to help everything blend easily).  But, the next day, for some reason, after heating them up in the crock pot, they just didn't taste as well.  I added a little milk cuz they were real solid, mixed in the butter which was way too much, added some raw garlic and more oregano and they were just okay.  The really weird thing is, a few days later we heated the leftovers up in the crock pot and once again they were absolutely delicious albeit sinfully fattening.  I don't think I would make these again.....I think I could make equally delicious mashed potatoes without so many rich and fattening ingredients.  BTW, I made chicken noodle soup with the liquid the potatoes cooked in and it came out fantastic!

This was awesome.  Everyone loved them some mashed potatoes last night. I did as others suj. and added Garlic and Herb Cream Cheese, garlic salt, oregano, Italian Cheese Blend and put a clothe over the pot before I put the lid on to catch the condensation off the lid. I will never make any other mashed potatoes again.

These were the BEST mashed potatoes I have ever had. 

I wanted to have a somewhat healthier version, so I did not add any salt (plenty in the boullion). I also used half of the cream cheese and half the butter, but all the sour cream. Since I was "taking out" some of the flavor by cutting these out/down, I decided to add garlic.  I roasted one head of garlic while boiling the potatoes and then added it into the crockpot for the entire cooking time.  

The garlic added lots of flavor, but wasn't super garlicy.  I could have easily added another entire head of garlic for a real garlic flavor.

Very good potatoes and none left over this year.  I used chicken broth in place of the boullion and added it back in slowly so not to make the potatoes soupy.  Also added the cream cheese and sour cream in small amounts.  Ended up using almost 16 ounces of sour cream and 2 boxes of cream cheese.  I probably used about 8 pounds of new potatoes with the skins left on. My slow cooker cooks really hot so I did not leave them in much more than 1 hour on low and then switched it to keep warm.  I added some butter and about 4 pieces of crispy bacon before serving.  Some chives or green onions would be good also.  I did place the terry cloth towel between the crock pot and the lid and did not have soupy potatoes at all but then they were not soupy to begin with.

Many compliments on these potatoes. I will definitely make again. I like that I prepared these in the morning and they were ready to eat whenever the rest of dinner was ready. I'll probably reduce the sour cream just a tad next time.

Wonderful recipe and very easy.  I added roasted garlic like other people suggested and it was excellent!  I wasn't sure about the cream cheese - but you can't even taste it. I think it might be good with cheddar cheese and bacon too - not light - but good!

Great recipe and went over well for my party and I did all the work before hand and kept them "warm" in my slow cooker.  I doubled the recipe though and the potatoes came out a bit dry, needed more milk.  They were great for leftovers though and everyone really liked them!  Definately not healthy...

I will not make mashed any other way, only thing I did was to add fresh chives on top at the end. How ever you need to try this same recipe with sweet potatoes, and cherry butter I made 10lbs and it was gone in a flash. Cherry butter just buy some dried cherries and melt the butter with them on low cook about 10 mins on very low drain cherrys and pour butter over potatoes amazing. Also I use pluga butter. Thanks for the best mashed potatoe recipe ever.

The Ultimate!! Wow..what can I say, I am speechless! I made these exactly as written and they were beyond my expectations. A couple of good hints from other reviewers are adding a little extra garlic if you like, and stirring now and then to prevent browning around the edges. This is going to be on my table during holiday cooking. All hail to the recipe submitter!!!

Excellent, and very easy. I made this for 40 people, added fresh chives and garnished with crumbled bacon. Turned out great, and even excellent as leftovers the next day, add some milk or cream and reheat!

I would give these 10 stars if I could:) Absolutely delicious and super easy to make!! Perfect just the way they are, but instead of regular salt, we added garlic salt & garlic powder just because we LOVE garlic!!!!! Thanks for the recipe=)

I have made a lot of recipes from allrecipes.com and never rate them. 
But, I have decided to go back and rate only my true favorites and this is one of them - the potatoes are delicious and everyone always raves about them.  I don't change a thing!

Really good!  Will be a special occasions dish as we try to limit our fat intake as a rule.  These are just loaded with fat but the taste makes them worth it. I used reduced fat sour cream and cream cheese, and only 1/2 stick of butter. Great convience having the potatoes done and off the stove keeping hot while the rest of dinner cooks.  Now I need another slow cooker for the  "slow cooker stuffing"

Used canned broth instead of boullion and water.  Added a sprig of rosemary to the cooking water to add a twist to it.  Used white pepper so the color stayed bright. Smelt so good cooking.  Smashed the potatoes into a stiff mess before putting in crock.  I didn't add the reduced cooking broth and butter until just before serving, and it needed only half the butter called for.  Brought them to a potluck with some snipped chives on top, set the crock down, and they were GONE!!!

I made this St. Patrick's day with corned beef and cabbage.  Excellent.  Made exactly as recipe.  Be careful not to mash potatoes to thin because alot of moisture gained during slow cooker process.  I added a little to much reserved water and they got a little runny, but they still tasted great.  Very easy and a convenient way to serve potatoes when you are having company.  Everything prepared ahead so you are not stuck in the kitchen.

Tasted just like any other mashed potatoes, I didn't find anything real special about it.  I did however like the idea of using the slow cooker, it helped keep the potatoes warm until serving time.

My mom called me up two days before Christmas and told me she'd decided I could make mashed potatoes for 12 people. I've always been fond of the boxed variety so this was a challenge. Of course I turned to my favorite site allrecipes and this was the recipe I picked. EXCELLENT decision. These potatoes are SO GOOD!! Everyone liked them and the little bit left was claimed by someone to take home before the table was cleared! The only changes I made was using Russet potatoes and reduced fat cream cheese. These didn't need any gravy and I would definitely make these again! Thanks Bwaye!

SO YUMMY! I WOULDN'T USE RESERVED BROTH TO THIN OUT POTATOES UNTIL THEY HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO SIMMER IN THE SLOW COOKER A WHILE. THEY TEND TO REALLY LIQUIFY ON THEIR OWN WITH COOKING. I USED REDUCED FAT SOUR AND CREAM CHEESE, AND IT WAS AMAZING!!!!

Even the 'potato eyes' have it with this yummy recipe!  So easy, but tastes like you slaved over it allll day with the exotic flavors!  I was in a time crunch so I put the crock pot on high for an hour and was good to go!  Wonderful with our grilled steaks and yummy cheese bread and salad!  VERY GOOD! :)

These potatoes are delicious!  I left the skins on and merely mashed the potatoes with a masher (didn't use a mixer to smooth them), so they had lots of texture.

This recipe was okay. It cooked well and was flavorful but I think I will stick to just boiling the potatos and mashing them up and skip using the slow cooker.

These were THE ABSOLUTE BEST mashed potatoes I have ever tasted. Everyone loved them at my Christmas Eve table. The cream cheese made them so much better! Thanks so much for sharing, and for a recipe that doesnt take up any precious oven room for a huge meal!

These potatoes were fabulous!  Of course, I made some changes!  I used yukon gold potatoes, and pressure cooked them for 10 minutes.  I also used low-fat cream cheese & low-fat sour cream.

I had leftovers, and these made wonderful potato pancakes too!

Good stuff. Came our nice and creamy. It also helped me get rid of those chunks that are so often in homemade mashed potatoes and that my family hates. Once the potatoes cooked down in the slow cooker (crock pot) I could mash those chunks down.

Delicious! Using a potato ricer and then lightly mixing in the cream cheese and sour cream ensures the potatoes don't get overly mashed and turn rubbery. My family loved the potatoes and it is very nice to make ahead of time.

The original recipe had too much sour cream, and so it over powered all the other flavors. Will add half the amount next time.

This recipe is wonderful and my 14 yr old just said, "it gets better with each taste." I don't know what to compare it to, but I love that it can go in the slow cooker...and the flavors were all enhanced during the time it was in the slow cooker. A couple of comments - I hate not knowing exactly how much liquid to add - I wanted at least a ball park idea (I used 1 1/4 cups...was that enough?...I was afraid to use too much). I used a potato masher, but it still left small chunks of potatoes and wasn't totally smooth. I happened to love that, but it was off putting to my 11 yr old daughter. Overall, I feel like it was missing something, but not sure what...next time I will definitely add more garlic. Also, it takes much much longer than 15 minutes to prepare 5 lbs of potatoes!! You have to wash, cut (and peel if you have picky eaters), then boil water and THEN cook them for 15 minutes, and finally mash and add all the extras. All of that takes closer to 45 minutes...but I'm a novice mashed potato maker. I accidentally added the butter before the slow cooker and it was fine. Next time I will put the potatoes in the mixer to get a smoother texture.

This was just o.k. for me.  I thought I would really like it because adding the cream cheese and sour cream sounded really good.  I did like them, don't get me wrong, but next time I think I would prefer lighter, fluffier potatoes that come from just adding cream and butter.  It's just a preference issue, but I still enjoyed this recipe.

This was a great recipe! Don't listen to some of the people that don't know how to cook and say this recipe lacks flavor or is too much work. They probably didn't follow the recipe right. They were great potatoes!!!!

We liked this recipe over another similar recipe on this site. Love how easy this is...and the convenience to have the potatoes done ahead of time on Thanksgiving. I failed to take heed and forgot to stir occasionally...that's a must to keep them from sticking to the cooker. The butter wasn't needed since we were putting gravy on the potatoes. Also, the left over liquid was wonderful for turkey soup!

These actually had more flavor the next day as left overs.  I think this one is more of a convenience recipe so you can make ahead of time and use the stove top for other cooking.

Served this dish at Thanksgiving...everyone loved! Very creamy and flavorful...will definitely make again. Loved that I was able to make up ahead and then took out of frig for a half hour, put in my crockpot, and let heat up slowly for serving..

This was PHENOMENAL!  My dish was the talk of the town at Thanksgiving!  I followed the recipe and added 1/2 quart of whipping cream.  I even took my hand mixer to it.  It was perfectamundo!!!  What a GREAT recipe!  I left the skins on 1/2 of the potatoes (used brown potatoes) and it looked super homemade and yummy.  At the end, I added two sticks of butter.  :-)

to tell you what happened many yrs ago, my sister put the mashed potatos in the crock pot, on low for an hr, it was a first time, no pc or cell phones at this time, when she opened the lid, they were like glue or wallpaper paste, unedible, never did that again, we just make sure that the potato's are done last then mashed, while making the gravy

I've been making this for years and always have an empty pan. Sometimes it gets served right after cooking without going in the crock pot and that's fine also. Since I'm lucky enough to have a large gathering on holidays, having the potatoes done and in the crock pot at serving time is a bonus and it lets the flavors really come together. If you're not a big fan of garlic or don't happen to have any on hand....leave it out.  It's still good.

Great recipe! Everyone LOVED this recipe and this was the first dish to finish at Thanksgiving. I followed everything, ingredients and all except I forgot to add the butter at the end, but you would have never known cause there was so much flavor. I added the salt and pepper while mashing the potatoes instead of at the end. I used the hint that the others posted about laying a clean hand towel between the potatoes and the crock pot lid to keep the moisture away, worked like a charm! This recipe is a keeper for sure, as I don't usually rate recipes, especially if I have to tweak it, but this one required no tweaking and was soooo easy, therefore it gets 5 stars and then some!

Made these for Thanksgiving.  All in all a hit.  The only thing I changed was reducing the cream cheese to 1/4 C.  I also made these 2 days prior- and turned them on low Thanksgiving day for about 4 hours- came out creamy- not pasty.

What a great way to prep for Thanksgiving!  All of the work done before everyone shows up, and more time to spend with the family, instead of slaving in the kitchen and stressing.  And, lets not forget how delicious they are!!!!   I pair this up with the slow cooker stuffing recipe on this site, and I am officially finished getting my dinner ready hours before the turkey is done!  Everything just takes care of itself, and I get to indulge in a bubble bath!!!

I used all purpose white potatoes and they turned out great! I did not add the butter. If you follow the hint to lay a clean terry cloth towel over the top, make sure it was not laundered with perfumed fabric softener as the scent will transfer to your potatoes!

These are my son's favorite potatoes ever. They are perfect for my Christmas dinner. I make them every year. I do use russets instead of red and cut down a bit on the cream cheese. Highly recommend!!

Tasted like twice baked potatoes. They are not the kind of potato to put gravy on. If you want mashed potatoes and gravy, do not make these. They do not taste like mashed potatoes. Would be fine as a stand alone potato recipe.

This was great! I think next time though I might cut the sour cream a little and try just 2 cubes. I liked it but I can definately taste the sour cream and Im not a big fan of that. We even enjoyed it the next day made into patties.

I was really looking forward to these, but I was disappointed. I followed the recipe exactly, and they smelled like beef fat--very repugnant. My guests enjoyed them, but I doubt I'll make them again.

My family loves this recipe! I am now the official "Mashed Potato Maker" for all holidays. The only difference I have made is to use store bought fat free chicken broth rather than the broth from the chicken.

Just made these for Christmas dinner tomorrow night and they are AMAZING.  Followed directions exactly, have not added butter or salt yet, and they are already deeeelish.  Plan to reheat them in the slow cooker. Will go perfectly with our prime rib!

FANTASTIC! Nothing needs to be changed. The only changes I made were I actually roasted the garlic and boiled the potatoes in chicken broth as opposed to using bouillon. Used the towel trick to absorb the water.

These were grate as a thought they would be.  I only make my mashed potatoes with recipes that include cream cheese since a friend of mine taught me to add it.
Like others reviewers i left out the butter for the last step.
Also used a paper towel under slow cooker lid to catch the condensation.

What a great idea, and almost as good as just made russets.  Everyone in my family loves fresh mashed potatoes, and this make ahead recipe is a delicious choice.  I was a little hesitant because I don't generally make mashed potatoes from reds, but they worked just fine even though dinner was an hour later than planned.

SO delicious and full of flavor!!! I'm instantly addicted to these. I didn't have time to boil the potatoes and put them in the crock pot because I was heading to a party so I put all everything in the crock pot and let it cook for 4 hours on high. They came out perfectly! Yum!

Fantastic! Followed exactly but skipped the butter. I can't imagine going back to the conventional method. Also, stayed super hot throughout the entire thanksgiving meal.

I already have a super mashed potato casserole that I use for Thanksgiving.  This year I decided to use this recipe because oven space is always an issue.  I will definitely use this recipe from now on.  I did not use the garlic, did not need to use any of the potato water & did not feel that I needed to add the butter.  I used the towel method that others suggested and even found them to be wonderful as leftovers!!!!

Made these for the company Christmas potluck. Super tasty. I was glad to have a way to make potatoes and keep them warm for the first half of the day and I suspect I'll use them next time I do a holiday dinner and don't want to deal with hot potato mashing at the last second. They aren't precisely traditional with the cheese and sour cream in them, but still very very good.

Good recipe. So easy to make and they tasted great! It was nice to have the potatoes done and not have to worry when I needed to get everything else ready. I took the advice of another reviewer and put a dish towel over the slow cooker. Delicious recipe!

I've made these mashed potatoes numerous  times since finding this recipe. Receive rave reviews each time.  There's no need to change a single thing but took one review's option and making them the night before just makes a busy day easier! Perfect for the holidays !

I used yellow yukon potatoes peeled, and omitted the chicken bouillon because I like to keep recipes as low salt as possible.  I just know that people will be salting their food at the table, regardless of whether or not it was salted during cooking.  I also added fresh, chopped chives. I've made a similar recipe many times as I like to get the potatoes out of the way the day before.  They keep very well in the fridge, as long as they are covered!  This works best if they are allowed to come back to room temperature before cooking in the crock pot.  Also, one trick for fluffier mashed potatoes is to mash with a ricer or a masher rather than a mixer.

5 stars! I used light cream cheese, light sour cream, and 1 and 1/2 Tbls grated parmesan cheese to replace the butter flavor and skipped the butter like so many others said. Way lower on calories and tastes just as guilty!! Also, used pealed Yukon Gold potatoes and 4 cloves of minced garlic, pan roasted, then added to the mashing process! Everyone raved and went back for 3rds and even a 4th! These are not your mom's wall paper paste potatoes! YUM

these were to die for! no need for the extra butter at the end! i try to stay away from MSG so instead of using chicken bouillon, i used part water and part chicken broth to boil the potatoes in and added some garlic in there! it was perfect!

I love this recipe!!!  It makes Thanksgiving Day prep so much easier.  Making them the day before alleviates one more thing to do on the "big" day.  I usually add the ingredients to taste and like the others omit the butter (or at least use less).  I also use low fat cream cheese & sour cream to cut the calories and you can't tell the difference.  Thanks for this recipe and making my day easier.

These were amazing!  They got a thumbs up even from my 10-year-old (a notoriously picky eater).  Next time, I'll try them with low fat sour cream and cream cheese to lower the fat content a bit, but the flavor and texture was amazing!

Very good recipe.  Great idea using the crockpot.  I love that you can make these hours ahead of time yet it tastes like you just put it together minutes before serving.  My guests loved the flavor.  Will make again.

Made these for a church potluck today. They were really good, but I added more garlic and some season salt. I added about a cup of the potato water, and then a little half-and-half because it seemed like it needed something more substantial than milk. NOTE: the whole stick of butter just floated on top, even after stirring. Next time I'll heed the reviews and only use 3-4 tbsp instead of the whole stick.

Very, very good.  I made it exactly as directed, but I did make it the night before, then refrigerated overnight.  Put it in slow cooker on low for an hour and then on high for two hours (my fridge is super cold), and no issues at all.  Fantastic potatoes.  Went great with our pork and sauerkraut today.

OK, so I messed up the recipe from the get go but it was still awesome!! I boiled the potatoes with just salt on accident but when putting it together I only added the chicken bouillon not all of it (only 1/3) and the garlic. Everything else I did as is and it came out perfect. I made it for Christmas Eve dinner and I got so many "yumms" at the table over the potatoes. I even had people call me the next day for the recipe and tell me that there is no way they could have any other mashed potatoes after these.

Absolutely wonderful. Followed exactly- except for mixing part of the butter in when mashing -and these were THE BEST mashed potatoes I've ever had. I love mashed potatoes and so I am always trying new recipes to try and find the best... DONE.

This recipe was great! Didn't have to rush last minute to get the potatoes ready. And was able to serve them hot throughout the meal. Will now be a staple for my Thanksgivings! And my picky nephew actually asked for the recipe!

These mashed potatoes are awesome!  I used a can of chicken broth instead of the buoillon cubes, 1/4 cup of half and half, light sour cream, and left the skin on.  My mom said they were the best potatoes she'd ever had!

I've always made my mashed potatoes with butter and milk. I tried these for Thanksgiving a couple of years ago, and they are delicious! In addition, it removes the stress of having to mash the potatoes and get everything else on the table right before for a holiday meal. It is one less thing to do! This is now my mashed potato recipe for holidays. I will be making these again this year for Thanksgiving. Oh yeah, I think the butter is a MUST! But then again, I love my butter! I don't eat mashed potatoes often, so treating myself once or twice a year with buttery mashed potatoes is okay!

i made them 2 days in advance. used russet potatoes boiled w/ whole garlic, whipped everything in my standing mixer(make sure not to exceed med speed level), and sprayed my slow  cooker. make sure to stir these periodically.these were hot for me after 1hr 30 mins even straight out of the fridge.i didnt need the towel or the butter(could just be my slow cooker, though).this was very good w/ bbq chix and creamed spinach casserole. will bring this as a side for thanksgiving. MAKE THESE!!!

Okay, at first I was totally afraid cause they seemed too runny, and I was the one that was supposed to bring the mashed potatoes to Thanksgiving. As they started to cool they became really thick and yummy. Everyone loved them!! :)

If you love a baked potato w/ sour cream on it than you'll love this recipe. We don't... I followed the recipe almost exactly, I added 2 tbs of garlic b/c we LOVE garlic and it still could of used more garlic. For me, all I could taste was the sour cream. Those who love that taste loved these potatoes but that was only 2 out of 9 people. I was looking for a more garlic mashed potato like you get at a resturant. BUT I did Love the fact that you can use the slow cooker and I will do that in the future w/ a different recipe and I also took others suggestion to put a dish cloth over the crock pot before you put on the lid to help catch condensation and that worked great! This was a very easy recipe to do and I can definatly see how this would come in handy on a busy holiday.

Made these for Easter lunch. I made them the day before and put them in the crockpot when we left for church. I would definitely recommend cooking on low and putting a dish towel under the lid. Ours cooked on high without a towel and got kind of runny. Once they sat for a bit they were okay though. We added a lot more garlic - yum.

Made these at Thanksgiving last year.  I always add cream cheese to my mashed potatoes and have never had problems with them tasting like glue.  I have never thought of putting them in the crockpot though and it worked out great.  Not much diferent tasting than my normal taters but it did help with dinner prep.  thank you!

I made these for Thanksgiving and everyone loved them...also asked me for the recipe.
My husband wants them again for Christmas!!
Thanks for a great way to make mashed potatoes.
By the way I used red potatoes and left the skins on. I used FAT FREE sour cream and cut the butter to 1/2 stick...delicious!
And just to let you know ...DON'T use white potatoes...they will turn out like "glue" ALWAYS use RED POTATOES!!

I don't use the slow cooker.  I just make these on the stovetop while my meat dish is cooking.  These are the only kind I make now.  Regular potatoes are just bland mush after eating these!

Delicious and so easy! My family loved them. As well as putting the towel on top, I stirred the potatoes periodically to make sure they didn't "cook" too much on the sides and bottom.

These potatoes were tasty but I found that mine ended up way too dry. I used someone else's suggestion to place a towel under the lid to catch the excess moisture that builds and maybe that is why mine were dry? Fixed with adding a bit of milk. Thanks for sharing your recipe, will be making this again!

Served at the last family gathering. Everyone loved them. Definately make again for family Christmas. Good keeper in the crockpot although 3 hrs is max. time as they get a bit crusty on the edge of the pot.

These potatoes are awesome!  I followed the recipe except that I used russet potatoes and 4 cloves of garlic (boiled in the water with the potatoes).  I also used a mixer to whip in the rest of the ingredients before putting them into the slow cooker.  I was a little leery about adding so much sour cream and cream cheese, so I added it a little at a time.  I ended up putting all in that the recipe called for.  All they do is enhance the dish, they do not overpower the potatoes at all.  This is also a wonderful recipe to take to holiday potlucks because it stays warm.  Oh, and I also followed another reviewers suggestion to put a dish towel in the top to absorb the moisture and it worked wonderfully.

Ok, these are beyond yummy, rich, excellent.  The only problem is that my I believe it's going to set my arteries screaming!  So high fat!  I would like to try this with low fat sour cream, low fat cream chees and NOT a half a stick of butter.  These would be fantastic for Thanksgiving or Christmas though.  What's great is that they are extra yummy and you could have all your dishes washed and put away before anyone gets there.  This was awesome, don't get me wrong, it's just so high in fat!!!

These potatoes were awesome!  I made them on Thanksgiving and it was great because I was able to have the dishes etc. all cleaned up before guests started arriving.  When we started eating my 21 year old nephew said "these mashed potatoes are great!"  Somehow you expect you might get a compliment on something you cooked for a holiday, but I never expected it on the potatoes.  These will become a regular for holidays in our family.  The only change I made was that I didn't use red potatoes.  The recipe is perfect as is!

These potatoes are the best.  I use whatever kind of potatoes I have on hand and they turn out fabulous each time.  I just got compliments from someone who claims to be a "very picky mashed potato critic" and he said they were very good.

These were as good as they sound. I have made these potatoes several times and each time I get asked for the recipe. The only changes I made were to roast the garlic, 2 bulbs in oven with olive oil and add with all the other ingredients with the cooked potatoes. And I also added the butter with all the other ingredients to save myself a step later.   
This will be recipe I use for a long time.

A wonderful recipe. If you like garlic, I would add another clove. Also, I found that the recipe makes alot more than 8 servings. I will be cooking for 20 people and will make 1 1/2 times the recipe amount which will be plenty. Be sure to add the reserved water a little at a time so the potatoes don't get too soupy.

This is a good mashed potato; a little different, but good. I added a little extra garlic to the finished product. For the fact that the crock pot is just an extra pot to clean please remember this. This recipe serves two purposes: 1) To produce a good mashed potato and 2) To allow you to prepare ahead of time and keep them warm until serving. You can certainly make these and serve them immediately. They are just as good. But those of you who want to get them done ahead of time has this option with the crock pot. I personally like the fact that I can make these beforehand, keep them warm and not be mashing potatoes at the last minute. So for me it is worth the extra couple minutes to clean the pot. Either method is fine and both produce a good end product.

This recipes is in fact TOO good! Now my husband and brother want me to make it for all their guy's get-togethers! They always ask for the maximum amount as well, even if it's just a couple of them there to eat it. :) It really is mouthwatering and flavorsome!

My husband and dinner guests loved these potatoes.  I did what another reviewer suggested and add roasted garlic to the potatoes.  The flavor is awesome.  This is a keeper.  Thank you

I made these for Christmas dinner.  Everybody loved them!  I took the advice of another person and cooked them in the crock pot. Remember to spray the crock with cooking spray before you add mashed potatoes.

Delicious! And oh so easy to prepare.  The only change I made was to use yukon gold potatoes and add 2-3 Tbsp. of freeze dried chives.  This recipe will definitely go in the recipe box to make again.  Rather than throw away the reserved cooking water I saved it but wasn't really sure what I was going to do with it.  That is until now.  I brought the reserved cooking water up to a simmer then added some instant mashed potato flakes (I used about 1/2 pouch (from a 2 pouch box) of Publix brand roasted garlic), wisked until smooth then wisked in a little cheddar cheese.  And now I have some fairly decent, easy to make potato soup.

Potatoes were so rich and creamy.  This recipe was easy. A little side note...you don't really need to save the water because the potatoes are at a good consistancy already.

made xmas eve.  Served xmas day.  Made one change.  Used new reynolds crock pot liners.  Worked great.  Potatoes were not dry or burnt on sides.  Put on high for 1 hour low for 2 hours. Left on low while on buffet table. everyone enjoyed them while I enjoyed my company because I wasn't stuck in the kitchen.

My mom was very worrisome about this recipe when I made it for Thanksgiving.  In fact she made "plain" potatoes on top of what I had brought because she thought the slow cooked potatoes looked gross.

They were DELICIOUS.  My family chomped them down.  My mom finally was convinced to try them and agreed they were good too.

Simplicity is the word with wonderful results.  I had family here and made them at dinner.  They were a huge success.  Next time I may add bacon bits or even chives.  I followed the recipe exactly.

I added MAYBE 1 tbsp of the broth to the mashed potatoes before letting it finish in crock pot. Perfect consistency. As others have mentioned, the potatoes do thin out a bit while cooking so add broth at end of cook time if at all. Very delicious potatoes!

Made this for a family get-together. It was a huge hit! I loved that I was able to do the work before hand so I could enjoy the party. That alone gives it 5 stars in my book!  It may not be the healthiest side dish...but it is pretty-darn tasty.

I really liked the taste. I think that I might have put a little too much milk. They were kind of mushy. Be careful how long you cook them for. I think too long breaks down the potato, Although they were better I think the next day.

These potatoes were delicious!  The flavors from the bouillion, garlic and sour cream were fantastic.  Definitely better the first day, though.  I saved leftovers and reheated the following day - nowhere near as good.

I made these potatoes for a pitch-in at work and they disappeared fast! Now they are asked for everytime and they are always one of the first to go.  I tried using lowfat sour cream and cream cheese but found the taste lacking a bit, but there were no complaints from anyone else.  So for my own personal satisfaction I'll stick to the "fatter" version.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very rich and tasty mashed potatoes!  We feed 8 young people every Monday and they loved these!  I also fixed them for Thanksgiving and again they were a hit.  It's so nice to make these with a fancy meal of ham or pork, and have them done ahead of time, and they don't take up room in the oven!  Thanks for the great recipe!

These were very tasty and a nice way to do the potatoes "ahead" and keep them warm for company.  I think I added just a little too much of the potato water...they were just a tad on the runny side, but firmed up once on the plate (out of the pot).  I will be making these for the holidays. Thanks!

This wasn't as good as what I was hoping it would be.  I prefer my homemade mashed potatoes..with lots of butter.  My husband didn't care much for them either.  Guess I'll either have to throw it out or make something out of them.

The convenience of the making early and warming in the slow cooker is diminished only by washing the extra pot.

I, too, used nonfat plain Greek yogurt.  Chobani's version has a great flavor for replacing sour cream.  My husband loved the addition of chive and onion cream cheese.  This was easy and I liked that it didn't have half and half or heavy cream!  Really good on top of a roast I made.  YUM!

I am in charge of mashed potatoes for 28 people at Christmas every year, I make this recipe and every year I get so many compliments. It is really good and easy I make it the night before and then heat it up in the slow cooker before Christmas dinner and add the butter right before serving. I use a towel on top like I read in one review which helps so the extra water doesn't get in it. For 28 people I double the recipe and that seems to be just the right amount. I'll continue to make this for years to come!

These are the best mashed potatoes I've ever had!  I use a little less cream cheese, but other than that, I do everything the same.  So yummy, it's now a family favorite!

Great recipe. I left skins on red potatoes and then diced up in small pieces. Did not pre-boil. Just threw into crock pot and poured a box of Chix broth over the potatoes. Sprinkled a good layer of garlic powder over potatoes. Cooked on high for 4 hours. Then transferred the drained potatoes into my stand mixer with cream cheese and sour cream. Poured back into crock pot and placed diced butter slices on top and kept on warm until my entree was complete.

Tastes like a loaded baked potatoe. Used russet potatoes after reading some of the review. Wasn't disappointed. More effort than boxed mashed but worth it.

My wife absolutely loved them however I made them a little to creamy. Next time I'll have to watch how much liquid I add back in while mashing them. I did add some parsley to mine.

Brilliant! Like others, I used a cloth to absorb the moisture and stirred it every now & then so it didn't stick.  I didn't use butter at the end, instead I used a bit of the remaining cooking water (that I had set aside) and the texture was just right. Everyone loved them; even my daughter who usually has no interest in mashed potatoes had 2 servings today! This is definitely a keeper, especially for holidays when there's so many dishes to get ready; this can be done hours ahead!

Super easy and very delicious! I cooked mine 2 days before and stored it in the crock pot container (in the fridge) until the big day. They heated up well and tasted wonderful! My gravy did NOT turn out so I was happy these potatoes tasted so good without the gravy:)

Never in my entire life did I imagine I would get rave reviews on my potatoes.  Literally never.  I never knew potatoes could be so creamy and fluffy and tasty in the same sentence!  But I got more compliments on my potatoes than I got on any other dish and I made a LOT of stuff for Christmas.  I reheated them today and made a fresh batch of gravy.  Today my husband told me they were the best mashed potatoes and gravy he's ever had.  I didn't change a thing.  I did not find that the butter at the end was too much.  It was perfect!

Came out perfect.  Used cream cheese and chive cream cheese.  I made it the day before, put it in the crock pot in the fridge overnight and then plugged it in about 3 hours prior to dinner.  Keeper.

These were great.  I halved the recipe and still had 4-5 servings leftover.  These are the best mashed taters to go with steak and garlic toast.

This has become my go to recipe for Thanksgiving. I can make it ahead and turn the crock pot on in the morning when I put the Turkey in. Just remember to stir every hour or so so the edges don't brown (unless you like it that way). You can sup this up by adding cheddar cheese on top before serving. Lots of potential with this recipe but it is excellent just as is.

Delicious!  Perfect for making ahead.  Not light and fluffy particularly, but exceptionally tasty.  I made an extra large batch for 50 people using 26# of potatoes, making it up in smaller batches then mixing it all together.  I pretty much made it up as the recipe except a few of the batches I forgot to add the bouillon, so made up some chicken broth and used it during the mashing process.  I didn't even notice the difference.  I added a bit of parsley and used garlic salt instead of  minced garlic.  YUMMY!  Everyone loved it and I had many requests for the recipe.  Thanks for a time saving and convenient recipe!

This is the best recipe! Made it last year for Christmas, and again this year for Thanksgiving for 50 people.  Everyone raved about it!! Since I made so much, I adjusted the recipe and used the 30 lbs of potatoes it called for, but only 4 -  8 oz containers of sour cream and 4 of the cream cheese instead of the 6 containers it called for.  I did use the amounts of boullion and garlic it called for....turned out so awesome! I'm making it again for Christmas! Everyone has asked for the recipe too!

Made these for Thanksgiving this year and I will use this method from now on. It was nice to have them done ahead of time. I used the towel suggestion and the potatoes were fluffy and yummy. I stirred but still had some browning on edges. Need to watch that next time. And these potatoes were good leftovers, even two days later.

Everyone at Thanksgiving dinner loved these potatoes.  I made them the night before and put them in the slow cooker for about 3 hours with a terry cloth between the lid and pot  the next day.  Great Recipe and so easy.

The softest mashed potatoes I've made.... This was my first time, lol. I just added one little detail.. I had made some bacon the other day and had the fat left from it. I added it to the potatoes when I was mashing it. All I've got to say is DELICIOUS!!!

I have made this recipe many times (as is as well as with minor alterations) and the results are always delicious! In fact, the mashed potatoes are so good people ask for the recipe and always want to take some home with them to devour (if the slow cooker is not empty). Here are some of the alterations I have made and why: (1) Scrubbed potatoes and leave skin on -- just because I am lazy sometimes and don't feel like peeling potatoes; (2) Vegetable bouillon cubes -- for those with a poultry allergy; (3) no bouillon and just boiled potatoes in plain water with the the garlic -- for those with an onion allergy. I just add more salt when using water. Not using bouillon is probably healthier anyway. (4) Keep a jar of reserved potato water near the slow cooker in case we need to add more if the potatoes seem to be getting a little dry.

Super tasty!  Received lots of compliments on Thanksgiving.  And even better - you can make them ahead of time.  I made them the day before exactly as recipe stated - then placed in the slow cooker removable bowl and refrigerated them over night.  The morning of Thanksgiving I put the bowl in the slow cooker and turned them on low.  Be sure to reserve the water they were boiled in - I mixed this in small amounts until the consistency loosened up to where I wanted them.  Keep stirring every so often.  They were hot and very flavorful come meal time.  Definitely my mashed potato keeper recipe for Thanksgiving!!!

I made a 1/3 portion today to test for Thanksgiving. It really is GOOD! To avoid browning, you may want to use non-stick spray. However, the browned part is crunchy and I like it! Prob won't let it brown for Thanksgiving dinner though. I used whipped cream cheese, no need to soften. I just tasted it and it really doesn't need any butter added, especially if you are serving it with gravy. Easy, tasty and frees up the stovetop for Thanksgiving!

Excellent recipe both times I made it. However, I tried to make it a little bit differently the second time. I actually substituted 2lbs of potato for 2lbs of yams. OMG these were incredible. My wife told me these were the best mashed potatoes she's ever had. We were all so pleased with these.

This is my go-to mashed potatoes recipe!  While no one could say it's low-fat, I think it hits all the right creamy notes for me, making it a real treat!  

My only change to the original is that I use veg stock so that this dish is vegetarian (so sad when stock makes a veg dish not veg).

Amazing!! I have made this recipe 4 times in the past 6 weeks and each time they have been the highlight of the meal! I will never make mashed potatoes any other way. The first time I made the recipe exactly as outlined, but have now perfected the recipe to my liking. I use yellow potatoes, and cut the sour cream in half, added a little more butter, garlic salt and parsley flakes. Talk about melt in your mouth, no need for gravy deliciousness! I found that boiling the potatoes a little longer helps with the creamy texture I like. If you like your potatoes lumpy, boil as directed. I placed paper towels between the lid and potatoes, I recommend this. I have made this the day before and placed the crockpot in the fridge overnight and cooked in the crockpot the next day and also made them with 3 hours til meal time, both were wonderful! Everyone will want your recipe. Enjoy!

I skipped the bouillon, cream cheese, and sour cream and stuck with butter and milk.  Basically, anything you can throw in a slow cooker on Thanksgiving and not worry about is a life saver.

I made these this morning for Thanksgiving. I am going to follow other suggestions I took them out of fridge at 11am and let them sit for an hour to warm up and then covered the crock with a clean kitchen towel and cooked for 3 hours. I added a little more of the reserved liquid and stirred them a few times while they were cooking in crock pot.  I doubled this recipe using 10 pounds of red potatoes, and this filled up my large crock pot (I'm cooking for 30).  I decided to add 3 pounds of cooked crumbled bacon and have already added some salt and white pepper, they  taste amazing. I reserved a lot of the cooking liquid and I used about two cups when first mashing the potatoes.  This is the easiest way I have found to make mashed potatoes for a huge crowd.

This is such a time saver during the holiday meals. The change I made was to roast 2 heads of garlic and use that instead of the minced garlic. Garlic in a jar or fresh minced can't hold a candle to roasted garlic. You may want to cut it to one head if you aren't a big fan, but I always use 2.

I adjusted the recipe for 8 lbs. of potatoes and it filled my large slow cooker very nicely.  I added much more garlic and a few tablespoons of Montreal Steak Seasoning.  I also added heavy cream ( a luxury because these potatoes were for a wedding celebration) until nice & creamy.  I cooked on high for about an hour and then switched to low for about three more hours. I did use the towel on top underneath the lid and it really makes a difference in capturing the moisture.  I also stirred the potatoes about once each hour and added about a cup of shredded cheddar cheese towards the end.  I forgot to add the butter but it was not missed.  The potatoes were excellent and were gone quickly at the party.  So easy but so delicious.

Amazing flavor! I couldn't get it to mash up properly, so I treated it like a smashed potato salad instead. Vegan bacon bits were a welcome addition. Rating based on flavor of original recipe.

Sadly, these came out gummy and glue-ey for me.
And the slow cooker just made it worse, I think.  :(
But I'm open to realizing it might have been my error, as well.
But aside from the texture, the taste was yummy.

Ok. I altered the recipe quite a bit, so the rating is based upon those changes. I replaced half the red potatoes with Jerusalem artichokes. The consistency of the Jerusalem artichokes after boiling and mashing makes the mixture only require about half the amount of sour cream and cream cheese and no butter at all is necessary. I also added chives to the mixture before adding it to the slow cooker. Everything else I did the same as the recipe. I cannot say enough good things about this dish!!

Made this for my daughter and husband. She liked them, he thought they were decent. I wasn't that impressed. Was rather lacking in any taste except for the rather overpowering taste of cream cheese. Just wasn't my thing. Would rather make mashed potatoes that everyone loved.

I am in love with these mashed potatoes! I tried this recipe on Thanksgiving because I always end up making mashed potatoes at the last second. This year I wanted to make them first and stick them in the slow cooker to stay warm. Came across this recipe and boy am I glad! I will never go back to plain potatoes again!

I made these according to the recipe with no variations. They were very good, and I will definitely be making them again. I made them kind of on a whim, just to try something different. They were easy and pretty quick, actually. I do have to comment that I agree with another reviewer that despite the addition of garlic and chicken bullion to the cooking water, I didn't notice much of either flavor in the potatoes, I suppose because it was in the cooking water, not so much the finished product. When I make them next time, I think I will add a bit of garlic to the actual potatoes. All in all, a very good recipe with the flexibility that using a slow cooker can offer.

I made our household traditional yukon gold mashed potatoes (boiled/drained diced yg potatoes, butter, cream, salt, and pepper) and used the crockpot as a warming vessel.  Was extremely helpful in allowing me to make the mashed potatoes early thanksgiving morning and not last minute!  :)

I'm giving it a 4 because I had to change a few things.  I used Idaho potatoes, 1 clove of garlic in the pot with potatoes, no chicken bouillon because I didn't want chicken flavored potatoes.  It was very good but a little too much sour cream so I'd cut that in half next time or leave out all together.  I only cooked it about 2 hours because I didn't want it to turn to soup.

Mashed potatoes were one of the dishes that I was asked to bring to Thanksgiving dinner at Mom's this year. I found this recipe here on AR. When I first read the ingredients list I wasn't sure about the cream cheese and the slow cooker method. I made them the night before and stored them in the refrigerator within the slow cooker crock with a towel between the lid and potatoes, as a few people suggested in their reviews. The next day I put the potatoes on low in the slow cooker for 3 hours, mixing in the butter after about 2 hours. I received many compliments. This is a great recipe for a special occasion!

I actually mashed the potatoes, sour cream, and cream cheese in the crockpot. Saved washing another dish. Once in the crockpot, I only added maybe 1/4 cup of the reserved water. I used heavy cream, and boxed chicken broth to get it the consistency that I wanted.

Didn't have cream cheese so used 6oz garlic-herb Boursin instead. Tasted good but got too dry/stiff after crock pot. Next time I'd add more liquid to account for the drying that happens in crock pot.

Works like a charm when you have other dishes to prepare or want to make ahead. We put a couple dabs of butter on top before serving just to make it look pretty. We always eat hot mashies in our house this way, can't go wrong. Make the taters however you want but use a crock to keep them warm.

I made these mashed potatoes for a pot luck at work.  The theme was foods that started with the letter "M".  The mashed potatoes turned out great.  Very creamy and tasted great coming out of the crock pot after cooking on low for 3 hours.  The only thing I didn't do was add some of the hot water from the pot of cooked potatoes into the potatoes that I was going to mash.  I was to nervous about the possible "dirt" particles that may have still lingered on the potatoes even knowing I washed them prior to boiling them.  I used milk instead.  Good recipe!!! Will make again!!

best suggestion from other reviewers was to use a clean white towel over the top of crock pot and then put lid on.  This worked great and the potatoes were not over starched.

Very good...substituted chive and onion cream cheese for the minced garlic and cream cheese.  Turned out very well.

Made these following the recipe exactly but these did not go over well with my family.  Reheating the mashed potatoes in the slow cooker was a great idea but the recipe itself really did nothing for us.  For my tastes it was too rich but at the same time very bland.  Will use the slow cooker technique in the future but will stick with my own basic mashed potatoes.

everyone loved the smashed potatoes. the tip from another review to cover with a towel worked great. the only thing i added was 3 or 4 strips of pre-cooked bacon cut into bits. everything is better with bacon!

If you are looking for something to change our ordinary mashed potatoes this is the recipe.  I love my mashed potatoes, but this recipe takes them to a whole new place.

Very good the first time served, but I had made two pans and froze one for later. After heating up the defrosted pan, I did not think it tasted nearly as good, a bit dry, which surprised me given all the fat in it. This is a great way to serve mashed potatoes to many people quickly!

Made these for a wedding reception because I wasn't sure how to get enough ready in advance. Peeled all the (60lbs) potatoes and put them in cold water early in the morning, then started making around 1 and they were great at 530. People asked if we were professionals thanks to this and baked Mac & cheese 2, :D Thanks!

These turned out really well. I was afraid that five pounds of potatoes would not fit in my slow cooker but I would advise everyone to do all 5 lbs. ALl of the ingredients fit easily into my crockpot, which is really small. Potatoes are always good, but when people tried these, eyebrows went up and everyone remarked on how creamy and delicious they were. I'll fully admit to "taste testing" these about 6 times - not to adjust seasonings but because they were so good! Great flexibility to the dish with the crockpot, too. I made this the night before for a potluck and just cooked it the next day. Easy and so good!

I have to say, I had my doubts about this recipe.  But after years of killing myself to get everything to the Thanksgiving table at the same time and it all being hot--had me searching for some alternatives.  This recipe was easy, delicious with plenty enough for a big crowd.  They were creamy and had wonderful flavor.  This is now my go to recipe for big holiday meals.  The only thing I changed was I used Yukon Gold potatoes, but followed everything else exactly.

I needed a large amount of mashed potatoes for a 12-16 dinner party, that was not at my home.  So I was looking for a way to keep the potatoes warm, that would not be an inconvenience to the host (knowing that their kitchen is small and would be filled with many dishes needing warming).

Using a slow cooker is the perfect way to serve large amounts of mashed potatoes!  I have not used cream cheese before, with my mashed potatoes and found that it blends well with the sour cream.  I used fat free for both the cream cheese and sour cream, the flavor and texture were both great.  I did end up using butter and added it before hand.  Next time, I will try without...to save on the calories.

For the potatoes, I used 2 - 5 pound bags of red potatoes (peeled).

This turned out awful.  They stuck to the bottom of crock pot and never got very tender.  Even with electric mixer couldn't get them creamy enough, and added tons of half -half and milk.

These really are great!!!!  Suggestion, even though sometimes I hate it when people switch everything up:  If you boil up a whole ten pound bag of the red potatoes and add 2 boxes of flavored Boursin cheese (Costco),
It fills up a large crock pot and it's enough taters for a big crowd. I used the same amount of all the ingredients except for those changes and they were awesome!  I also just mixed in the butter with everything else.  Everyone will be asking for the recipe!

I made this recipe today for Thanksgiving and it was fabulous.
I followed some of the suggestions as: added herb & garlic cream cheese instead of plain and used only about 4 oz. of the water the potatoes were cooked in as well as I placed a dish cloth under the lid ( a must). It really absorbed the water that might have gone into the potatoes, making it too watery. Also, remember to stir the potatoes occasionally.
This is a nice addition to our Thanksgiving meal. A keeper!!

These were delicious!  So creamy and decadent-definitely the best mashed potatoes I've had in a long time!  I used fat free cream cheese and sour cream to lighten the recipe, as well as reduced the butter to 1/8 cup (2 Tbsp).  I slow-cooked them for the full 3 hours and they did not harden!  Yummy!  My fiance loved them too and so I will definitely be making them again!

Lovin it! I used organic vegetable bouillon in place of the chicken and extra fresh garlic. I am very appreciative to the tip on using the terry towel over the top. Makes perfect sense. As a full time student, worker, mom and home maker, I rely a lot on the slow cooker. I'll use this technique on other items as well.

My new favorite! Creamy and flavorful! Works well if you don't add garlic too!

Yummy mashed potatoes and a great solution to making these ahead and keeping these warm while other dishes are cooking. I made these the night before and did have to add milk the next day to make them creamy again when I was ready to heat them.

Just made these for Thanksgiving dinner -- in the crockpot now on warm...and they are AMAZING !! I only made two changes: 1) added about a half cup of heavy cream while mashing and 2) added seasoning salt instead of regular.

My new and ONLY mashed potato recipe from here on out.

I just made these and put them in the crock pot - I am so happy I don't need to worry about the timing now. They are delicious even before the butter. Cooking them in broth with garlic adds great subtle flavor. I used vegetable broth instead of chicken because I have several vegetarians coming for Thanksgiving. Thanks for the recipe!

I wasn't sure how the potatoes would be after keeping in a slow cooker, but they turned out fantastic! It was great to be able to prepare the dish ahead of time and keep it hot.

I made these for Thanksgiving dinner this year. The mashed potatoes tasted great and it was nice to not worry about making the potatoes at the last minute.   My only complaint is that my slow cooker took up valuable counter space that my guests wanted to use as they gathered in the kitchen. I will definitely have to rethink where to put the slow cooker if I make these potatoes again. Maybe I'll put it on the stove top, since that only got used for making gravy.

These were fabulous---very rich and a good taste.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I agree though, not really a need for the slow cooker unless you want to keep them warm for serving.

My nephew said these were the best mashed potatoes that he had ever had!  I forgot to add the butter, but they turned out great!!  The crock pot makes them nice and hot while cooking for 2 to 3 hours so that you can concentrate on cooking the rest of your meal.  How convenient!!

Until yesterday, I dreaded making the mashed potatoes on Thanksgiving... thanks to this recipe, they were the best dish of the day! I followed the recommendation of another reviewer and covered them in the CrockPot with a brand new kitchen towel- perfect!  I also omitted the butter figuring my guests could add it if they so chose.  I left the potatoes in the pot for 2 hours on low and then the warm setting through dinner. This recipe allowed me to interact with my guests during those normally hectic minutes just before dinner is served. 5 stars for taste and 10 stars for convenience!

I made these for a pot luck at work.  I cooked the potatoes the night before, then warmed them in the crock pot the next morning until lunchtime.  Everyone loved them and asked for the recipe.  I forgot about the butter at the end, we didn't miss it.

An excellent recipe for large dinners since you can prepare it the night before. I was worried it had more of a sour cream taste but the pot was literally cleaned out after the dinner. The recipe can be modified easily to suit your guest needs, more or less sour cream, add chives etc.. Be interesting to try out different potatoes, maybe even add some sweet potatoes.

These potatoes rock! I halved the recipe and left out the sour cream (yuck) and only added 1 tbls of butter.  As they were in the slow cooker I occasionally added some of the cooking water.  The method of boiling the potatoes with the garlic and bouillon is key. I used a whole clove for the boiling process and then discarded. BF does not like chunks. Delicious!

I took a chance and made this for 15 guests on Christmas.   The potatoes were wonderful, and were very easy to serve in a crock pot.  I am going to use this recipe from now on, to save the stress of last minute potato mashing.  Thank you for sharing this fantastic recipe!

This was great!!  I had no room in my oven and was grateful to have my slow cooker to save room for the turkey!  I skipped adding the butter as there was already alot of cream cheese and sour cream in the recipe.  Using the garlic and chicken bouillon really added lots of flavour to the potatoes!  I will DEFINITELY make these again!

These were AWESOME!  I loved, loved, loved the fact that you could keep these in the crock pot and free up the stove.  I used the towel to help keep all the moisture off the potatoes.  My dad thought that wouldn't be good, and I thought they might burn in the crock pot - but they turned out great!!  Everyone loved them and didn't believe I made them the day before!

I tried this and the stuffing recipe in my crockpot at Thanksgiving this year and it they both were a hit.   What a lifesaver to free up the stove and oven.  I too forgot the butter but they were still really good.  Thanks so much for the recipe and tips from all the others

I have tried several do ahead mashed potato recipes and this is by far the best.  My search is finally over.  Anything that can add less stress to turkey day for me is a winner.  I did not change a thing and tried them on company this weekend so  I would not be disappoined on turkey day.  Everyone loved them.  Thanks so much BWAVE.  I used the rest of the liquid from the recipe for the Michigander Turkey recipe from this site and that worked too.  I hate to waste anything so I will repeat the same for turkey day.

I wasn't sure how the potatoes would be after sitting in the crock pot all day while I was at work, but they were the best mased potatoes we ever had. The only change that I did was to add some sour cream to the potatoes before mashing.

I love this idea.  And the addition of the sour cream and cream cheese made for a very creamy, slightly tangy potato, which we enjoyed.  I didn't really care for these with gravy though, so I will stick to my old stand-by recipe when I want to have gravy.

Being able to prepare early and keep warm, this recipe scores high with me. It made a huge difference of ease at Thanksgiving dinner (Canadian). No more crowding pots on the stove top. Great flavour and a very creamy texture.

These are some good stuff. Instead of dirtying 2 pans I just cranked my nesco oven up to 500 and boiled the potatos in there. Mashed em up in there as well. We really enjoyed these and I loved the ease of having them in the slow cooker ready to go while I was frying chicken. I will use this one on holidays as well!!

I used milk instead of reserved water to reach desired consistency and chive cream cheese (all I had on hand) and I really liked the added flavor the crm chs gave it. I used fresh roasted garlic too! I did not find this to be more work than normal mashed potatoes. Not sure why others did?!?!

Definitely the best mashed potatoes.  The first time I made these was 2 years ago for a Thanksgiving dinner at the office.  I have never in my life heard people rave so much about potatoes!  That's all they talked about for days.  It blew my mind the *mashed potatoes* were the highlight of the entire Thanksgiving dinner!  Even months later, my coworkers were emailing me telling me they had made these for dinner the night before.   I personally don't find them to be a lot of work.  I tend to peel my potatoes, so that's the hardest part -- everything else is compeltely easy.  The red potatoes are the key, though.  I made these with russet potatoes this weekend because I had gotten a great deal, and the flavors don't develop as well with the russets.  I was cooking for a vegetarian so I had also substituted vegetable stock for the chicken bouillon.  Don't get me wrong, they were still better than any other mashed potatoes I've eaten, just not quite as good as they are with the baby reds.   Anyway, YUM, they're delicious.  My boyfriend, coworkers, and family beg for these potatoes, and I don't blame them at all.

I made these following a review by Megan using garlic & herb cream cheese and adding italian cheese blend at the end. I chose this recipe to save me space on my stove top when I was cooking a big dinner Everyone loved these mashed potatoes. So easy and really great taste. Definately keeping this recipe.

I've make this for the last three Thanksgiving dinners.  My family loves this so much.  I do spray my crockpot with light olive oil before placing potatoes in it and I always add a splash of butter and milk to the edges.  I appears to not burn as easily.  I do recommend light stirring every 1/2 hour or so while cooking in the crockpot.

Excellent!  I made these the night before, mashed them up in the slow cooker dish, put it in the fridge and heated them up the next day for 2-3 hours. I also used a dish cloth under the lid and may add more garlic next time. Hands and stress free for the day of!

This particular recipe was fun to make and the smell was nice as it was cooking.  I prepared this for Thanksgiving dinner.  It probably wasn't something I'd describe as 'bursting with flavor' -- but my kids and husband enjoyed it well enough, and it was nice having the potatoes in the slow cooker as it gave me a little extra space to cook the rest of my meal on the stove.

These are sooo good.  I used russet poatatoes in place of the red (I've found that they make beeter mashed potatoes) and homemade chevre (goat) cheese in place of the cream cheese.  I also like to add fresh chives.  It was wonderful to take to a church potluck because I could plug it in and it stayed good and hot until we were ready to eat.

These poatoes are fabulous, and so convenient to make in the slow cooker. No last minute mashing while you're trying to make gravy, vegetables, and serve food. I love it! Used the tea towel method recommended by other reviewers, and it worked really well. These will be part of my Christmas Eve dinner along with beef tenderloin with roasted shallot sauce from this site. Thanks so much!

These potatoes were the best ever.  I couldn't believe how easy and delisious.  I made these for Thanksgiving.  I made them ahead of time since they need to sit in the cooker and I didn't have to worry about the potatoes taking up room on the stove and keeping them hot.  This is a great way to do it.  I will never do it any other way again.

Followed directions and it tasted too sour creamy and was too watered down.

Reviewers are so funny - people say "I don't see the reason for the crock pot" - ok let me answer that - the REASON is because it holds the mashed potatoes while you are doing other things - this is especially helpful at Thanksgiving - which is today!  I am making this recipe which makes perfect mashed potatoes - and then do not have to think about them.  They are done and waiting to be eaten.  I even have my stuffing in a 2nd crock pot doing the same thing.  Very nice when you only have one oven and are cooking the turkey too.

Pretty good, but mine turned out really dry - which surprised me because so many other reviews said their's got soggy.  The flavor was really good, though, so I will definitely try it again.

Heavenly!  I first made these when I hosted my first Thanksgiving last year & have made them several times since.  At first I was worried that the crock pot would turn the potatoes too mushy or gummy, but they've been perfect every time.  Depending on what I'm serving these with, I tend to omit the garlic.  Regardless, I will never need another mashed potatoes recipe again!

These tasted great, but after dinner I went to put them in the fridge, and they came out of the bowl in one solid chunk. For some reason, after they sit for a while, they're very solid! Now I'm worried about what to do with the leftovers.

Very good recipe - I used garlic and herbed cream cheese.  I tried the trick of putting a towel just under the lid to absorb moisture and it worked well.  Great for saving a burner when lots of cooking going on.
Thanks for sharing!

I used regular potatoes because that is what I bought originally.  We cut them up and left the skins on.  I have to tell you that the family went nuts and said they will never have any other kind of mashed potatoes again!  These are going in my favorite folder!  Thanks for sharing

WOW!!! these potatoes are the best!!! my whole family loved them when i served them with our traditional christmas eve dinner! i even overheard my nephew say to his mom 'these are even better than what you get in the restaurant!' and being able to have the potatoes ready to go ahead of time was such a help! and the idea of putting the towel under the lid was very helpful! cant wait to make these potatoes again!

My family enjoyed it, however there wasn't really anything special about it.  It tasted just like mashed potatoes prepared without the chicken flavoring and garlic.  There really wasn't anything significant about it.  It was ordinary.

I brought this to our Company Potluck and it received rave reviews. 10#'s of potatoes went in no time at all.  I was short on sour cream so I added mayo & it turned out great.  I also mixed everything with a blender before transering to the crock.  This will definately be a repeat recipe for me.

I love this recipe!! I have been using it for holidays for a few years now and I'll never go back.  No more sweaty mashing of the potatoes while trying to get everything on the table at the last minute.  These are hot and ready when you are!!  Thank you so much for this recipe.

These are a great alternative to mashed potatoes. I roasted 4-5 garlic cloves in the oven and added them and 1/2 of the butter to the potatoes as they were being mashed. I also buttered the crockpot before I put the mashed potatoes in. My husband isn't a big garlic fan, but he loved these. Yummy!

I made these potatoes to serve along side a pork roast at a dinner party we were hosting.  The end result was pretty good, but I did mess up the recipe a little.  When I cooked the potatoes, I forgot to add everything to the pot, so I ended up having to add it after the fact (I just minced 2 cloves of garlic, added to the mashed potatoes and hoped for the best).  I did follow the advice of another reviewer by placing an absorbent towel under the lid to collect the moisture and it worked out great.  The potatoes were still a bit more runny than I would have wanted, the the flavour was pretty good.

This made Thanksgiving so easy.  I'm normally trying to whip potatoes at the last minute so they won't get cold while I stir gravy with the other hand and set the table with my toes.  

Because my boyfriend hates cream cheese and was giving me the hairy eyeball, I didn't add the full amount of cream cheese and added some evaporated milk instead.  He loved the potatoes and couldn't taste the cream cheese.  I'll put the whole amount in next time.  Do yourself a favor and use a crockpot liner.

Oh, these are fabulous. I love, love, love mashed potatoes and this is the best recipe -- it's everything I've wanted in a potato. So creamy! So delicious! The holy grail of mashed potatoes!

(I used dairy-free cream cheese and sour cream, which is not only healthier, it tastes practically the same. I also added rosemary.)

I thought this was really good. I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone commented that they were the best mashed potatoes they ever ate! I couldn't figure out why they were so good, but I think the garlic and the broth were the key. Also, I didn't peel my potatoes, so that gave them some extra color and flavor. I only used a little butter, dotted over the top of the potatoes in the crock pot, but otherwise followed the recipe. Thanks!

These turned out great!  I didn't need to add much butter, and I surprised my mother-in-law, who didn't think people would like them with sour cream and cream cheese.  They did!  The flavor is so mild from the sour cream, and no flavor from the cream cheese.  They were just nice and creamy, and best of all done in advance to free up space in the kitchen to make the last minute dishes for Thanksgiving.  I plan on using this for all the big holiday get togethers in the future.  Thanks for the recipe!

put a dishtowel across slowcooker under the lid to absorb steam.  added only a little butter.  easy enough but i don't know if they were the best mashed potatoes ever.  they were good, but i didn't feel like could taste the flavor of the sour cream (light) and cream cheese (1/3 less fat variety).

Ridiculously fattening, but my Thanksgiving guests all raved. It was the best mashed potatoes they'd ever had. It's a fabulous "once in a while" dish, but the amount of fattening ingredients would keep me from making this regularly.

I loved these mashed potatos! I did not add butter at the end .. or salt & pepper. Also when mashing I added a tiny bit of milk. Other then that... it was very good!

The best part about this recipe is that you're not rushing at the last minute trying to mash the potatoes.  Everyone absolutely RAVED about these.  No joke.  We doubled the recipe and added chives & 2 heads of roasted garlic.  Perfect.  The one suggestion I would insist on is that you put a dish towel between the crockpot & lid.  Otherwise you'll end up with soupy potatoes.  The cloth absorbes the steam, leaving you with the perfect consistancy.  Delicious!

I think this recipe is great!  It is easy to make and the additional ingredients add a lot of taste to regular mashed potatoes.    It was convenient that I was able to take it in the crock pot and keep it warm for our Thanksgiving family gathering.

This is a good recipe. I left the red skins on, mostly because I'm lazy but it ended up looking and tasting great this way. Used the towel trick to cut down on moisture. I drained all but maybe 1/4 cup of the water and that was plenty, I didn't need to add any more water/milk. Also, I didn't want to boil the garlic with the potatoes because I didn't want to lose any in draining (garlic lover), so I tossed the garlic in some olive oil, wrapped in tinfoil and threw in my toaster oven for like 10 min at 250 f. Then I chopped it up and threw it in after everything else was mashed together. Got lots of compliments at Thanksgiving. Will make again!

Very creamy, very rich.  It was wonderful not to take up a burner while trying to make Thanksgiving dinner.  For those who do not know, "mashed" potatoes have been peeled ... "smashed" potatoes still have their skins.  So, for this recipe, you are supposed to peel them.  I did not do this and made them smashed.  They are very good, just not "the best" IMHO.

WONDERFUL!  I had very little time so I went with one hour on high and they were marvelous!  I didn't have chicken boullion cubes on hand so I used beef.  Very good!  This will be my mashed potatoes from here on out!

Pretty good. I would like other reviewers recommend running a mixer through them before putting them in the slow cooker. They were VERY hot throughout the meal. I did not add as much butter as what is called for and I was short a little sour cream so added a touch of heavy cream instead as it is what I had on hand and a little extra of the reserved water. Mine stuck and formed a bit of a crust on the sides of the slowcooker but all in all, tasty!

These are the best mashed potatoes EVER!  I followed the recipe exactly.  I am a huge potato fan and very picky when it comes to recipes.  Not only do I use this recipe continually.  I am asked to bring it to family functions constantly.  EVERYONE loves it!!

Everyone really enjoyed these potatoes.  I found the butter at the end way too much though.  Next time I will only put a couple tablespoons in.  Other than that it was great!

I loved the fact that I could make these ahead of time, since dinner time is so hectic with school back in session. Next time around, though, I'll cut the amount of cream cheese in 1/2, they were a bit tangy for my taste. I assumed that they would thicken up a bit, so I made them a bit thinner than I normally would have, and instead, they got even thinner, so next time, I'll make them the same consistancy as I would mashed taters that you eat immediately. Overall, a winning recipe! I even used the leftover juice from the potatoes, by pouring it over the turkey I was cooking as well!

Can I give more than 5 stars?  WOW!  These were awesome. I made them the day before, put the crock in the fridge till about 3-5 hours before dinner, and WOW.  Everyone RAVED about these potatoes.  I did use more garlic than called for, as we are a garlic family, and it was just perfect.  What a better way to keep mashed potatoes warm?!

These are absolutely wonderful! I've made them several times for my family and friends and I think it is their favorite part of dinner! I think the best part is you can make them several hours before dinner and then just put them into a crock pot instead of rushing at the last minute to finish them and hoping you time it just right so they will be hot, not to mention the flavor is amazing!

These were awesome, nice twist on regular mashed potato, with the cream cheese and sour cream.  Didn't do the slow cooker (didn't have to).  Gonna have to try that another time to see if it makes any difference.  This will be added as a new fave! Thanks for sharing!

These were okay.  They tasted average but the real plus was being able to make them ahead of time and freeing up the stove for the rest of the holiday meal.  I would probably make these again for a big meal or for a potluck.

I love the slow cooker idea as it is a way to avoid cold potatoes right afer they are mashed. I used FF cream cheese, RF sour cream, and only 2T. of butter to cut down on fat/calories. They tasted great!

These are the best mashed potatoes yet that I have tried off this site (and I have tried many of them!) The time in the slow cooker doesn't matter a whole lot, I have found. I don't time it, I just put them in until everything else is ready. One hour on high works to cut down on the time.

These were the tastiest potatoes I've ever had! I didn't tell my boyfriend I changed up the normal way I make potatoes, and he actually noticed they were extra delicious and raved. I think they would also be great with green onions and cheddar, mabye some bacon too, or just some chive and onion cream cheese instead of plain.

These were awesome!  I roasted my garlic & may have added a little more than the recipe calls for.  I also made them two days in advance to save time on the day of the meal.  It was great to just put them in the slow cooker & not have to worry about it.

This recipe is incredible.  I prepared this as a side for a rack of lamb and the potatoes almost stole the show.  We LOVED this recipe and I don't think I'll ever be able to have traditional mashed potatoes again.

These are wonderful! I make them every year for Thanksgiving. We make them the day before and keep them in the crock. (refrigerated) The next day we just warm them up! We add extra, extra garlic! If they are too thick the next day - just add some milk. It is great to have the oven open. Delicious!

This is an excellent recipe and received rave reviews from my family and friends at Thanksgiving. I made it nondairy -- I used Tofutti nondairy cream cheese and Tofutti sour cream. I did use butter but you could make it entirely nondairy by using margarine. I fed it to a group of people who really like dairy and got many compliments. I also prefer white pepper to black peppercorns for potatoes. This is a great way for people who are lactose intolerant -- and those who love them -- to enjoy wonderfully fluffy mashed potatoes.

I have made this recipe twice.  Once exactly as written (4 stars) and last night as loaded mashed potatoes.  

Differences the second time around included: using stock rather than water and cubes, adding crumbled bacon, sharp cheddar cheese, and chives.

Thanks for idea of mashed potatoes in a slow cooker!

These are great. We made them for a holiday dinner. It was nice not having ANOTHER thing on the stove or in the oven. They can be prepared ahead of time and thats a plus. The taste is a much appreciated change from plain old mashed potatoes.

I made these tonight to go with turkey and gravy, and they were my husband's favorite part of the meal. Very yummy, and a nice change from regular mashed potatoes. I will definitely be making these again.

This was great.  We didn't even put it in the slow cooker because everything else was done.  I didn't really have to add too much broth either.  We like our potatoes thicker though.

These were definitely the best mashed potatoes I've ever had! My only change will be to put less butter next time, but I'm not a big fan of butter (not for fat but don't love the taste).  I didn't use too much of the reserved water - it didn't need it and the butter added more liquid.

I've made these two times now and the last was on Thanksgiving.  I plan on doing it again for Christmas.  I used a potato ricer to mash the potatoes and it gives it a lot smoother texture than using a standard potatoe masher like I did the first time.  I didn't add a lot of the reserved broth and before I put it in the slow cooker, added a bit of rosemary.  Before serving, I topped with some fresh chives.  They were a big hit.  However, when chilled for leftovers they got pretty thick.

These potatoes were really good, but they seemed to take more effort than they were worth. I like to use my slow cooker for convenience (just toss in some ingredients and my meal is done a few hours later), but this recipe requires you to actually make the mashed potatoes before you ever put them into the slow cooker. I might as well have mixed all of this up on the stove, which is probably what I'll do next time.

This was great - I cooked Thanksgiving dinner for 17 when I was 8 months pregnant, and this helped make it run smoothly.  It was done and ready before everyone arrived, and they all loved it!

I always get compliments when I make these potatoes.  I usually don't add the butter, because I find that they're rich and flavourful enough with the cream cheese and sour cream.  Making these ahead of time is a real time saver when people are coming for supper.

Very simple and tasty.  I don't like eating my mashed potatoes plain, and this jazzes up potatoes that might otherwise be served without gravy.  I tried it with lowfat garlic and herb cream cheese and it still tasted luschious.

I've been using this recipe for almost two years now and am just now getting around to rating it.  It's awesome, but I skip the slow cooker altogether (I usually am using it for roast beef or something to go with it, i'm a slow cooker junkie)  I did notice that the potatoes thinned out when I used to slow  cooker, but I like mine chunky and smashed instead of whipped and creamy, so now, to cut back on time wasted I just boil the potatoes (sometimes in just water if I dont have buillon and dont feel like chopping up garlic), smash them with cream cheese (try the herb and chive for flavor) and sour cream.  I also use less since I dont want to be a lard booty.

Excellent!  I had to bring a side dish, and I knew the place where I was visiting was going to short on oven space.  I even made these (fully cooked on low for about 1 1/2 hours) the day before.  When I got to my destination, I reheated the crock pot insert in the microwave, and then set it up on low in the crock pot for about an hour.  The only thing I added was some minced onion to the potato mixture once I mixed in the butter, salt and pepper.  Eveyone raved about how good these were.  Thanks for the post!

My husband LOVED these..."So much richer and creamier than usual" he said.  I agree, but I think I may reduce the sour cream next time.  I could definitely taste it next to the potatoes.  I messed up and added the butter before putting it in the pot, but it turned out fine.  I added just a little bit of broth to thin, so it was just a little thicker than we like when I put it in the crock pot.  By the time it was done it was the perfect consistency!  Went just perfect with our roasted Prime Rib and Stir fried broccoli and carrots for Christmas dinner!

These may not be the best mashed potatoes I've ever eaten, but they certainly are the best leftover mashed potatoes.  No mistake, they're really good the first time around, too.  But I gave the recipe five stars because they're just as good, if not better, the next time.  I've used these leftovers with shepherd's pie and they make it truly outstanding.  I've also made potato cakes and simply served them at another meal and they're always wonderful.

Good flavor but I think the crockpot is unneccesary. Next time, will skip step 2 and just mash and get my mixer out and serve 'em up.

Great tasting recipe.  Used the concept of the "refrigerator mashed potatoes" from this site to make ahead and then put in crockpot next morning.  First time they were too dry and stuck to the crockpot, but still good. Heated in microwave and added extra cream the second time before placing in crockpot and they were wonderful. (I doubled the recipe for a large crowd--just used enough broth/water to cover while cooking.) Good to the last scoop.

These are the BEST mashed potatoes I've ever made.  In fact, one of our daughters insisted on licking the spoon after I transferred the potatoes from the bowl to the crockpot...and said they were better than the restaurant's where she works.

These are now the holiday staple at our house.  They are requested by all our family members.  It is so nice to have them done early and not worrying about mashing potatoes as everything else gets done.  Warning though, I tried to half this recipe for a small group and it didn't work as well.  Just keep the recipe the same and have some left over.

Not the best mashed potatos in the world, but they sufficed for an easy pot luck contribution.

Were these ever good!  No, not for the health conscious, but I made these for a special occasion, and they were very appreciated.  Very creamy and flavourful.  I will say that they don't re-heat well, so try and make these when you have company, so you can finish them off right away.

Excellent mashed potatoes. Since they are done in the slow cooker, all done way in advance and they remain nice and hot when it is time to serve. Thank you Bwaye.

This recipe is awesome! I leave out the butter because the other fats do the job just fine. I also don't cream the potatoes because my family likes this recipe in a more chunky potato-salady consistency. Yum!  I thought the milk solids would separate in the crockpot and make for a gross mess but it didn't at all. All in all - a WONDERFUL recipe. I can't wait to show it off for the holidays!

I wasn't too sure how red mashed potatoes would taste, but they were wonderful.  I used light sour cream & cream cheese to reduce a few calories and they were still very tasty!  This recipe is great because you make them way ahead of time and have plenty of time for the rest of the meal.  This is a keeper!

Considering the fact that I only eat my mom's mashed potatoes, I found this one to be very good! I found the chicken bouillon an interesting ingredient. I do need to double the recipe next time because my hubby kept "tasting" it.

These were very tasty but the texture of the potatoes was sticky. I used gold potatoes. Next time I will try red. Also, I used the dish towel under the lid to absorb moisture. Changed to a fresh  towel mid way through. Both towels
Absorbed a lot of moisture so I was happy I followed that advice from another review.

I tried this and it was not great. It just tasted like sour cream with a little bit of mashed potatoes. I would make this again but I for sure will not be adding any sour cream to it.

Awesome recipe! I still don't understand why you need to cook potatoes that are already cooked but they came out great and freed up space on my stovetop. I got rid of the cooking liquid by accident so I used 1/2 the cream cheese and sour cream and used milk/half & half to thin it out. Will definitely be making these again for Thanksgiving.

These potatoes are a hit! To save time on Thanksgiving day, I prep the night before and refrigerate. I put it on high in the crockpot to warm for 30 minutes or more depending on the number of servings, then switch to low for 2 - 3 hours. Even when I forget to add the butter, they're still yummy with the gravy.

These were a disaster.  
Cooked the potatoes over 8 hours and they were still hard as a rock.  The starch at  the lower temperature will retrograde.  This can be an advantage when done properly,  but the slow cooker messes it up.  I I Threw the batch out and went to my old method.

I left out the cream cheese. I did not add the butter until I was reheating, and I added 4 sticks to 10 lbs of potatoes, which reheated in my crockpot in about 3.5 hrs on high.

Great way to make potatoes for a crowd ahead of time. I didn’t use as much cream cheese as called for. Added garlic powder. (You can add just about anything.). Forgot the butter, and it wasn’t missed. Used the towel inside the cover of the pot as suggested to keep moisture from running into potatoes and stirred a few times to keep the outside from cooking too much. Terrific!!

My family raved about these amazing potatoes.  I used the call out of another with the towel over the top of crockpot.  I also added a touch of flour to thicken them up.  I like another user added Italian Cheese for amazing results.

I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfect. I didn't have a proper potato masher so I used one of those ground meat cutter upper things (technical term:)). The potatoes were lumpy and smooth at the same time which everyone loved. I will definitely make this again.

These are a special occasion dish due to the decadent ingredients!  This is always on the menu for Thanksgiving and Christmas.  It makes it so easy to do ahead when you are trying to time all the dishes and make room for burners on the stove.  They taste amazing.

I make this almost every Thanksgiving. I use a towel in the crock pot to prevent soggy potatoes and stir every now and then to prevent browning. It doesn't even need the butter. Everyone loves these mashed potatoes!

These are more like keep warm potatoes than they are slow cooked. I give this recipe 4 stars because of what they add makes them perfect. They would get 5 stars if they recommended cooking them in the crockpot from the get go.
Just toss cubed potatoes, 1 stick of butter cubed, 1 tablespoon of chicken Better Than Bouillon (or 3 cubes), 2 teaspoons minced garlic, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper together in a 6-quart slow cooker. Add 1 cup of water, then cover, and cook on high until the potatoes are tender, about 3-4 hours. (The potatoes might have browned lightly in spots but that is okay.) Drain some of the liquid if there is still a lot. Mash with sour cream and milk, then enjoy.

While it was convenient to be able to make these in the crockpot for the most part, the flavor of these potatoes at the end was not great. The potatoes tasted far too creamy for our liking even though the texture and consistency were right! In the future, I’d probably do like half of the sour cream and cream cheese as the recipe calls for, if even that much!

I will make it again but I had to add more salt - and I am usually a low sodium cook.  I also wished I had put in more garlic (maybe another tablespoon) or maybe used a bit less potato.  The flavor wasn't all I was hoping for.  But the consistency was fantastic.  I just think next tie the proportions of each thing should be adjusted.

These potatoes were SLAMMING. I only did 6oz of cream cheese because I was worried they would be too tangy and I’m glad I did - I think the proportions were perfect. They were a huge hit and will be my go-to mashed potato recipe from now on. Bonus points for clearing up oven space!

Made with 10 lbs. peeled russet potatoes and doubled the recipe. They were kept warm in an insta-pot for our fellowship Thanks Giving Potluck Buffett. All were eaten and were a big hit. Thanks for the great recipe!

Overall I thought these potatoes were pretty decent! I recommend using extra boullion when boiling. Used extra garlic and added cheese as I thought they were a bit bland. I used the cloth tip which really did help. I did not add any of the drained water as I thought that they were moist enough!  Definitely remember to add the butter, it really make or breaks the potatoes! Everyone at dinner enjoyed! Very quick and easy!

Love these! I got so many compliments when I made these, they've become a staple for holidays.  I typically use a few cloves of roasted garlic but that's the only change. I would suggest reducing the sour cream a bit (it can be a tad sour with that if you're not careful). The first time I made these I didn't have an issue with burning but the second time they burned after about 4 hours. I suggest after 2 hours, stir them every 45 minutes or so and keep them on low or warm.

I have tried many mashed potato recipes, but this one is the best by far! Made this for Thanksgiving and they were a major hit. Everybody asked me to make them again for Christmas. And then I actually made them two nights after Christmas for leftovers night. I make the recipe exactly as written and they have turned out perfect every time!

I used gold potatoes & peeled them before cooking. Also, I cut the butter in half as others did. They were great!

Yes!!!!! Thank you so much for this recipe. I made these for two holiday pot-lucks, and people loved them. I’m not sure how necessary it is to use a slow cooker, they would probably be amazing just right away like regular mashed potatoes. However, I love the addition of the slow cooker because it allows me to start cooking them early and gives me plenty of time to get ready for whatever event I’m making them for, so I don’t have to worry about them. I did what others mentioned with putting a towel on top of the cooker to prevent excess condensation from running into the potatoes.. works great! The recipe itself is SO simple. I hate peeling potatoes.. so I love that this calls for red potatoes, so much easier. You really don’t need to put much of the reserved cooking liquid in before mashing, especially since the butter you eventually add melts and adds more liquid as well. I did need to add a fair amount of salt to these at the end, and I’m not really someone that cooks with a lot of salt. They were just a little bland. I will also say that I think saying this serves 8 is only true if you are feeding 8 lumberjacks! I brought them to a party with 15 people, and I came home with a plastic container full of leftovers, not that I’m complaining. :-)

Made ahead of time and reheated (added some milk and butter to “freshen it up”) - way too dry.  Probably a good recipe for same day use.

Great recipe, made the day before and used the InstaPot to warm for 3 hours (stirred once and added more potato water; did not add butter). Good flavor - added about a dozen garlic cloves. Thanks!

Great recipe.  I forgot the butter at the end as well, and it was just fine.  I did make 1 1/2 times the recipe, trying to feed 11 adults and felt like it made 20 servings.  We had a ton of mashed potatoes left over.

These mashed potatoes turned out awesome.  I did swap the chicken broth for half and half because some of my guests are vegetarian.  it was rich but oh so good.  will always use this recipe for large crowds.

Definitely use a liner and depending on your slow cooker, warm setting worked well. I used less sour cream and subbed in the potato/chicken broth water. Turned out great.

Was not crazy about these.  Followed the recipe exactly even the suggestion of the towel and mixing often but there seemed to be more cheese flavor than potato flavor.  Do not think I will use this again.

What attracted me to this recipe is the time saving factor of using the slow cooker. Unfortunately we didn’t care for the texture —especially knowing all that extra fat being added.  Nothing like good old fashioned mashed potatoes the traditional way and just putting those in the slow cooker!

Delicious! I excluded the cream cheese and sour cream and instead used lactose free, whole fat yogurt. It turned out really well. Thank you for sharing this awesome recipe!

Excellent.  I added a little too much broth and also did not add the butter.  It really wasn't needed.  This will be great to make for Thanksgiving.

My entire family LOVES these.  There are NONE left, even on Thanksgiving!   I've got my sister's families making them too - and they love them equally.  FYI - they are rich, so I don't make them often, but they are a pure treat for the special times I do make them

These were surprisingly bland,  even though I used the chives & onion flavored cream cheese --- a full 8 ounce container, as the recipe states, and the full 8 oz container of sour cream.  I added 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper as I was mashing, and it was still bland. I then added 1/2 t garlic powder, which made it better, but the consistency was also kind of glue-like and heavy/thick. 

I know how to make good mashed potatoes, so it is not user error.  This is just a heavier, thicker recipe. Some people may like it, which explains the good reviews, but it just isn't anything special and is less good, texture-wise, than just using butter & milk. 

I was planning to use this for our Christmas Eve dinner, am so glad I did a trial run first, because now I know I will not make these.  It's a bit annoying to have wasted the ingredients and the money,  as I ended up throwing away almost all of this, but it is better than stressing on Christmas Eve and have a dish that just isn't very good. I always recommend a trial run.

If you do make these, a few this: 1) Absolutely use a terry dish towel under the crockpot lid, and stir every 30 mns or so. 2)  Cook on Low for 3 hours. 3) Do use the butter at the end to help with the texture and flavor, but start with half a stick (4 oz) instead of the whole thing, and go from there. 5) Leave the skin of the red potatoes on. It's pretty and tastes nice, and makes much less prep work.

This was excellent! I used Yukon gold potatoes since those are our favorites. Then I used some chicken stock rather than bouillon to reduce saltiness and I had the stock available. I will make this again! Family loved it!

These were delicious! I was hesitant about leaving the skin on,  but it was just fine. I like chunks in my mashed potatoes, so I just makes them manually in the pot.  I didn't have to use but maybe a 1/2 cup of the reserved water. I didn't use a full stick of butter,  maybe just 3/4 of the stick.  I will definitely make these again. Thank you!

I made these for Thanksgiving Dinner at my mom-in-laws and received several compliments. I omitted  the cream cheese, garlic and chicken bouillon, but used plenty of the liquid from cooking the potatoes. And I used russet potatoes. The best part was being able to prepare them several hours ahead of time and keep them warm in the crockpot.

I made these to take to Thanksgiving dinner at my parents' this year.  Each year my mom has progressively despised messing with the potatoes so I volunteered and she suggested using a slow cooker so they could stay warm.  Brilliant!  I'm guilty of trying them before they went in the crock pot.  I'm not sure it was entirely necessary for the flavors to 'meld' for a couple of hours because it was delicious as is.  It was great having them still hot for dinner, but when I make them again, if they are staying home, they will be ready without use of a slow cooker at all.

I didn't make this recipe at all, but made my own mashed potatoes my way (which involves using an electric mixer) but I followed the slow cooker method and they were just like I had mixed them and served.  These potatoes went from my house to my hostesses house and waited approx. 2 - 3 hours to be served and everyone raved.  All those years of making at the last minute!  No need.  These were light, fluffly, everyone loved them.  Don't be afraid to try it.  I did it on Thanksgiving for a crowd of nine.  5 lbs of potatoes was perfect with approx. 3 servings left for left overs.  Love it.

Great base recipe. We made this a day ahead for Thanksgiving and changed the recipe for 7.5lbs of potatoes. We added the recommended amount  of cream cheese and sour cream for 5 lbs and they still were great. I think I'll add more garlic next time. The reserved water that wasn't used went into our stuffing...yum! Great recipe!

These potatoes are delicious! I used Yukon gold potatoes, otherwise following the recipe exactly as written. Per some of the reviews, I placed a clean dish towel under the lid to absorb the steam and avoid a watery mash. I don't know that making them this way saved me any grief in the overall process of preparing Thanksgiving dinner, but they were delicious enough that it didn't matter.

I made this recipe for the first time for Thanksgiving this year.  It sure made dinner prep a snap! They were amazing! I did not add the boullion to the water only because I think it's too salty. I only added the garlic. I doubled this recipe and also added garlic powder and onion powder and a splash of milk! I made it the night before and put it in the slow cooker crock. Took it out  3 hours before dinner and set the crockpot on low. They were a hit! Will always use this recipe!

This was my second batch of potatoes on thanksgiving and also did not turn out well. It needed a lot more liquid and there is si much water to cook the potatoes that adding the reserved water did not work very well. My sister was able to save them for me, but I'm not trying this again.

I make these every year at Thanksgiving. I use russet potatoes because my son won't eat skins and i cook them right in the crockpot. Start early in the morning and once the tots are tender I drain and add the remaining ingredients. I also keep a damp cloth under the lid once they've been mashed to keep them moist as someone suggested. Always, always a hit!

I doubled the recipe & peeled potatoes prior to watching the video. The picture shown is not the way the video instructions which is to leave the peel on the potato. Since I boiled them in 2 batches I left the skin on the second batch, which worked out well. It was a little much for my crock pot to handle a double batch so saved a bowl for us prior to the potluck. 

I also used the chive and onion cream cheese and that made the potatoes. I stuck to the recipe other than that and I didn't use much excess liquid.

These are absolutely amazing!! My family loves them. I feel the real key to making these good is the chicken bouillon. It gives such a full flavor to the potatoes. I've even had to skip the cream cheese or sour cream at times (just didn't have them on hand) and as long as I have the bouillon they turn out great! By the way, if you ever HAVE to make instant potatoes, try throwing bouillon in the water and you'll be amazed at what a difference it will make. I tried it when I had to make potatoes for a crowd right before surgery and people thought they were real.

By mistake I doubled the boullion amount but it came out amazing. Also, the boullion I used were chicken with roasted garlic and that was great. Served with fried onions. My family was fighting over the last portion and have requested it as a side for Thanksgiving!

The mashed potatoes were to die for! I used only 1/4 amount of butter. It was already very good with the cream cheese and sour cream. I also used towel over crock pot to absorb water. I will make it every year for Thanksgiving!

Delicious! Was great to have them all made and keeping warm in the slow cooker until everyone got home from work. The recipe exactly filled the crock of large oval cooker. Served with sauerkraut and sausage recipe (also from this site) for a nice German comfort food dinner!

Not sure how to rate this because I was missing ingredients but the way it turned out with my changes was a 4...seems like it would have been a 5 i will update this when i make it again per the recipe. All my cream cheese was bad so i doubled up on the sour cream....it made it super sweet so i added garlic powder and parm cheese to add a contrast. I used the terry cloth as recommended and they came out great, missing little bit of creaminess that i would have got from the cream cheese. This method was very east and stayed hot I will definitively make again. I also forgot the butter and it didnt need it.

Tasted good but could not get the texture how I wanted.  Mashed potatoes are supposed to be fluffy and these were more heavy and soupy and full of lumps.  Disappointing.

This is the only way to make mash potatoes. I followed the recipe, except that I didn't use chicken bouillon I use Chicken Broth and cover the potatoes  with enough broth. That is the only change I made.

Awesome, to get more flavor try boiling down the stock you cooked the potatoes in before you add it to the potato mixture.  It really enhances the flavor.

This recipe is super easy and is absolutely one of my favorites. My husband wanted homemade mashed potatoes and this was the recipe for it. These potatoes will melt in your mouth. I can't eat sour cream so I just used two packages of cream cheese instead and it still came out fantastic. The best mashed potatoes recipe in the world hands down, and my husband absolutely loved them.

Family favorite. My husband asks for these all the time! I add very little of the reserved broth, it doesn't need much. This goes so good with Chicken Marsala, the sauce over the potatoes is scrumptious!

Great!  The family loved them.  I did put half the amount of butter as suggested by some reviewers, but next time I will put full amount.  We all found that we had to add more at the table.  This made A LOT of potatoes, after my family of four ate them, I still had 4 (16 ounce) containers left.  Put them in the freezer, hope they will be OK upon re-heat!

Decided to try this over the standard recipe I normally do last week and WOW they are amazing! My son is asking me to make them for the third time and the elderly lady who I care for said they were some of the best she ever had. I made the recipe just as it said and see no reason to change it. Yummy as it is.

Really good!  I made them a day ahead of time, then plugged it in Easter morning so it had a good long while to heat up while company arrived and we fixed the rest of the meal.  I took another's advice & covered it with a dishtowel so it wouldn't get soggy.  Skipped the butter at the end.  Yum - fluffy & flavorful!

I love mashed potatoes. Hands down, one of my favorite foods. This recipe has ruined mashed potatoes for me because they put the normal, everyday mashed potatoes to shame...by a mile...

These potatoes turn out thick and creamy every time. Boiling them with chicken bouillon is a brilliant touch that adds a lot of flavor. Essentially, these potatoes are so great on their own that they don't even require gravy. 

One word of warning, these potatoes are RICH, which I love, but may not be everyone's thing. Consider yourself warned.

Super recipe. I really overcooked before putting the potatoes into the crock pot but it was still the most complimented item on the menu. Most guest went back for seconds of this dish. I will definitely make again, can't go back to the old way.

I made these for Christmas and picked this  recipe because of the ratings and how simple it seemed. Well, I did everything it stated to and after 3.5 almost 4 hours of being in crockpot these potatoes were still hard. They had little to no taste. My husband took one bite and said they were bad. Although I could have tried to cook longer for another meal, I chose to throw them away. Not a great find for my holiday. Won't make this again

These are delicious! I'm not a great cook so I really like recipes I don't need to make changes to and these fit the bill.  I just cooked the potatoes, mashed them up with the cream cheese and sour cream,  filled the slow cooker and into the fridge they went! Tomorrow (Christmas morning) will be so busy with cooking breakfast, opening gifts, and then cooking again it's comforting to know the potatoes will be ready whenever we are! I've been making these for years and everyone loves them.

Best mashed potatoes I have ever had. Everyone gobbled them up. I love it that I made them 2 days before the dinner I was having, and when they were served and on the plate they are HOT not lukewarm.  I used garlic and herb cream cheese which was perfect.  No need to add butter if you are serving gravy.

I've made this recipe for years now. I love it and so does everyone else. Here are my tips for this recipe after making it about 30 times.. . 1. Add half of the given amounts of cream cheese and sour cream, taste the potatoes, and add more carefully to taste. Sometimes I love having the full amounts but my husband does not. 2. When adding your reserved water back into your potatoes, do so carefully or you'll add too much and make mushy potatoes, and always scoop up from the bottom of the bowl where you'll find the garlic hiding. If you really want to be an over achiever, use something to strain your water and put all of the garlic and seasonings into your potatoes. I use my sifter because it has tiny screen holes but I bet there's an easier way to do it.  3. For heavenly loaded mashed potatoes add shredded cheese, bacon bits, and green onions. 4. If you do add too much water, just cook up a bit of plain instant mashed potatoes and add them in for a quick rescue. 5. Skip the crock pot unless you need to transport the potatoes or keep them warmed.

I have made these for Thanksgiving and now Christmas two years in a row. Only way the family wants them! I make them the night before, put the whole crock in the fridge. Then I just have to put them on in the morning.  One thing that I do is add chopped garlic to the water while boiling the potatoes.  That way there is a bit of garlic flavor without it being too strong.

I needed a way to keep the mashed potatoes warm for a buffet so I made this dish. I made one change, I did not reserve the water from boiling the potatoes nor did I use the bouillon cubes. Instead I used my staple chicken broth in a box to taste.  This dish was a big hit!

My "go to" mashed potatoes recipe. It lets me work on the other meal items and get the potatoes done and  cleaned up before the family arrives.  I always forget the butter at the end but no one notices.

These were a big hit at my family's Thanksgiving dinner last year (2015) I am making them again this year (2016). I would recommend putting very little of the water back into the potatoes. The sour cream and cheese cream cheese  works  just as good.  I add the chicken bullion into  the water before it was boiling so it would  dissolve and not get stuck to the potatoes. Also I used a chive and onion whipped cream cheese for some more flavor.

I prepared this dish for Thanksgiving and it was huge hit!  I started my spuds about 2 hours into the cooking of the turkey.  Then transferred them to the slow cooker until the turkey and other dishes were done.  I did omit the garlic as a personal preference, but they were huge hit and the left overs did not last long!  It was so wonderful to have the potatoes ready to go when everything else was ready.  This dish has a permanent place on all of my holiday menus from this day forward!

Any and everyone that tries these potatoes love them. I have made them two days in a row because they were demolished both days. Some of the most picky eaters are begging to take home leftovers. Can recommend them enough!

These were a great hit with the family and are officially on "the list".  I didn't change anything except maybe a little less butter.   I especially like the fact that you can make ahead; a real time saver!

We made it turn out good with a couple changes.  After 2 hours there was a lot of liquid even though I used the "towel on top" method suggested by another.  Also, we have gone paleo, with no dairy, so didn't add the cream cheese, just the sour cream.  had it in one of those cooking bags, too.  ladeled off the extra liquid, added butter and mashed more.  pretty yummy!  I'll try again without the bag.

Yummy!  I made these for Thanksgiving (1 of several dishes) and since I was able to get them into the crock pot before our guests arrived, it gave me more time to spend with family and reduced the stress of trying to put everything together at once! I normally always use red potatoes (I leave skins on), cream cheese, and sour cream in my potatoes any ways!  I like my potatoes chunky! I did use 1 bouillon per cup of water though as I think that really enhances the flavor!

Made for Thanksgiving and they tasted great but it was way to soupy.  I made just as directed and it was like potato soup so make sure if you make it add a little at a time to make sure not to get a soupy effect. Otherwise not bad. Will have to try again with new measurements and see if its any better.

I made the recipe as is, except I doubled it. I used two blocks of low fat cream cheese and a 16oz container of low fat sour cream. I cut the butter out and didn't even miss it. I did use the kitchen aid to whip the potatoes more and make them lighter and when I transferred them to the crock pot I used a towel over the pot and then used the lid. DEFINITELY use better than chicken bouillon to cut down on the salt

This year makes the third year I have made these potatoes  for Thanksgiving. There are never any leftovers. I use regular Idaho potatoes because my family prefers them. A Crockpot liner means there is only 1 pot to clean. Delicious and easy!

I am on mashed potato duty for Easter, Thanksgiving and Christmas when our entire large family gets together. I like to use this recipe with the exception of using reduced sodium chicken broth instead of bullion cubes and water for my dad's dietary needs  and no garlic just for our personal taste. The convince of making these ahead to avoid the rush is the key here. I too, use the kitchen towel and crock pot liner. I will be traveling to my son and daughter-in-laws out of state this year for the first time since their marriage and I'll be taking this recipe with me. I'll also pass this on to my mom who will be making the Thanksgiving potatoes. Our Thanksgiving dressing will also be made on the counter in a second crock pot, using it for the entire cooking time.

Loved the potatoes. We peeled before hand and added cheese and bacon to the finished product. Great for football Sunday!

Loved these!  Only change I made was to start with everything *but dairy* already in the crock pot + one 1/2 cup of water...cooking the potatoes in there saves even more time and stove top space on holidays (I also mash in the crockpot with a potato masher) Adding dairy, and mashing right before serving, the crockpot ensures everyone gets hot mashed potatoes & I only have one pot to wash (unless I go all out and use a crock-pot liner!) Soooooo easy! And yummy! :-)

These potatoes have wonderful flavor!  I love the fact that they can stay warm in slow cooker and I can focus on other things I am making.  Big hit with my family.  Left the skin on the red potatoes.

Excellent! I will never make mashed potatoes any other way when making a holiday meal with lots of components. They did get a little brown around the edge of the pot, but the recipe makes generous serving so we just scooped from the middle. I tasted before adding butter, and the cream cheese and sour cream made it plenty creamy. I added the butter anyway, but it was just as good without.

TASTY!  These are the new hit at our house - made them Christmas Day and heard only positive remarks (and the empty slow cooker spoke to how much our group liked them).
I made the recipe with one *slight* alteration - I used Herb & Garlic cream cheese - because I wanted them to have a bit of punch.  Everything else I did exactly as stated.  The cooking time was perfect and the potatoes (with skins on) were easy to mash.  
I used someone's earlier suggestion of having a clean terry cloth dishtowel under the lid to collect moisture and to avoid the potatoes from becoming watery - worked like a charm!  I stirred every hour or so and in total mine were in the slow cooker about 5 hours.  
This served 10 people (with many taking seconds) and nothing was left. 
Will make again!

These are very tasty mashed potatoes.  Made them last year for Christmas dinner (everyone loved them), and realized when I went looking for the recipe for this years dinner that I had never rated the recipe. 
Took a few tips from others and put a linen dish towel under lid to absorb condensation, stirred occasionally while in the crock and to save a few calories omitted butter at the end and never missed it.  
Saves a burner on the stove and also eliminates the last minute mashing of the potatoes.

Voted "absolutely perfect" by family. First time I used my potato ricer. Second time just smashed with potato masher. This is easier and just as good as ricing method. Make ahead and warm in crock pot the day of serving.

Hosting Thanksgiving is stressful - no matter your menu or guests - you're going to get a little rushed.  This recipe however - definitely helped minimize those feelings!  Easy and delicious.  Might add some minced garlic or a dab of horseradish next time.  Would also be easy to use chive-cream cheese.  Highly recommended.

These potatoes are amazing! I usually don't like to make mashed potatoes because it is difficult to keep them warm. Who wants cold potatoes? I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and not only were they delicious, but were kept piping hot. It was also great to make them ahead and put them in the crock pot in the morning. Thanks for this "keeper" recipe!

Wow!  These were the star of the Thanksgiving meal!  I have always added cream cheese and butter to mashed potatoes, so I didn't expect these would be much different.  I was wrong.  Boiling the potatoes with bouillon and garlic made a huge difference in the end product.  As we cleaned up after the meal, most of the sides had 2/3 of the food remaining.  These potatoes, on the other hand, were wiped out.  One person even told me they were "the best food they had ever put in their mouth" and that they were going to ask for these for their birthday.  You don't get better compliments than that!

I made my usual make ahead Sour Cream Refrigerator Mashed Potatoes (from allrecipes.com), which is very similar to this, but did the slow cooker thing per this recipe. Somehow only managed to get in slow cooker 2 hours ahead but it needed 3 hours. Will definitely keep this in my Recipe Box!

I agree with this rating, but only assigned 4 stars, because despite following the tip to use the towel under the lid to keep the condensation from dripping on to the potatoes, after they had sad for a while, they were too soft for my liking.  I also think the instructions should mention that using a hand mixer will help create the smooth fluffy texture most prefer.  I would add less of the boullion cooking water at the beginning, leaving the potatoes thicker than I want them to be at serving time.  Once the sour cream and cream cheese melt, the consistency changes.  We left out the garlic, but everyone REALLY liked them, and it was a huge advantage to make them in advance, keep them warm, and free up the stove using the slow cooker.  Superb flavour, and the boullion cooking water into the gravy was also a great addition.  Thanks for sharing...everyone wants the recipe.

I just made the potatoes for Thanksgiving.  They were fantastic.  I made them early and then put them in the crockpot.  I was worried that they would be dry but they actually got creamier as they cooked.  And the flavor was fantastic, I used yukon golds because they make the creamiest mashed potatoes.  Keeper!

I made these potatoes for hubby's birthday dinner (along with Pork Roast with the World's Best Pork Loin Rub and Peach Pie, both from this site.  Also sweet corn and homemade mac and cheese, my own recipes).  It made a fantastic dinner, compliments throughout the meal!
I cut the recipe down to 3 lbs of potatoes, but forgot to cut the other ingredients.  They turned out to have a pretty strong cream cheese taste because of that ratio, which my husband loved.  Next time I would use the correct amount of potatoes.  I also forgot to add the butter, but they tasted great to us anyway.

Great mashed potato recipe.  I haven't had the best luck with making mashed potatoes - so these will definitely be made again.  BTW, I used peeled russet potatoes and they were great.  I do want to try making with red potatoes to see if they are lighter in texture.

These were super yummy!  I made them for a crowd at Christmas and they were totally devoured.  I did have a little browning around the edge of my crock pot, but it turns out, I liked that part the best.  I scraped it all off the sides after the pot was empty and it tasted like a twice baked potato.  I will be making this again.

These were okay. I took the advice and put a cloth under the lid but I still felt like they were soggy.

This recipe saved me on Thanksgiving!  We hosted a brunch with one family and then supper with my husband's side.  I definitely needed a time saver, and this was it!  My husband wasn't paying attention when he peeled the potatoes and did the whole 10 pound bag.  We had a very large crockpot of potatoes for the 15 of us.  After the three other families took what they wanted of the leftovers, I was left with only a quart sized storage bag.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  The potatoes were so good that many of us skipped the gravy!

Excellent flavor and I am not a fan of mashed potatoes overall.  It was a little hard to gauge how much of the potato water to add in.  I wasn't sure how much they might dry out in the crockpot.  I added a bit and stirred it in - they were soupy.  To my delight, they cooked up like I thought and I added the butter to bring about the consistency I like.  They definitely needed salt.  I cooked half a batch and adjusted ingredients for that.  The only change I made was the type of potatoes I cooked. I used russet because it was what I had on had.

The best mashed potatoes ever. I used this recipe the first time for Christmas Dinner, so I was very nervous that I would ruin the main side dish, but they were perfect.  Got lots of compliments and because they were hot was a big plus.  Try it, you won't regret it.   I was so skeptical, but so glad I did this.

I made these on New Years Eve. They were delicious! I did use a terry cloth towel on the top of the crockpot as was suggested  as I was concerned about the potatoes getting soggy. That seemed to do the trick as the consistency was fine . I used a whole package of cream cheese but next time I would cut it back to half a bar as they were very rich. I did not add butter before serving as I did not feel it was needed. I would make these again and perhaps add some fresh scallions.

The best mashed potato's I have ever had!  I make this every Thanksgiving - using the crockpot frees up my oven for the turkey & sweet potato's. I make this every year & have experimented a little with this recipe...I found the BEST combo is using flavored cream cheese...I use veggie cream cheese & chive.  I use the light versions of cream cheese & sour cream BUT I add in some extra real butter. I also leave some of the skin on the red potato's.  This is so delicious.

Not my favorite way of making mashed potatoes... I liked being able to prepare these ahead of time, but the cream cheese threw it off for me. It had too much of a sour tang.. I think I'll omit the cream cheese next time.

Wonderful taste and perfect to make up early in the day when hosting holiday dinner! Daughter in law impressed me at Thanksgiving with these potatoes; really good with homemade gravy. Will prepare these often in the future. Easy and tasty!

These were good.  You may want to make them a little creamier than you normally would. Mine dried out just a tid bit when in the crockpot and a little more when reheated the next day. Easy with good flavor though and this recipe makes a lot of taters!

They were good, but just a bit too rich for me. You could REALLY taste the cream cheese flavor. I loved everything about this recipe... Boiling the potatoes in bullion was so smart. I liked the idea of using both sour cream and cream cheese, I have always used sour cream and heavy whipping cream for extra creaminess. If I try this recipe again, I think I will cut the cream cheese in 1/2, otherwise I'll omit the cream cheese altogether will only use sour cream and heavy whipping cream.

Prepped it the night before. My wife got mad because she saw the bouillon cubes in the potatoes as they were boiling and thought I was going to ruin one of the things she loves about Thanksgiving. I would recommend putting them on longer in the slow cooker in the morning at the low temp. I cranked it up to high for the last hour and they were warm, but not toasty war. I had no problem with moisture either. The taste was amazing! Definitely make these again.

This was a great recipe, however, I added extra broth to the crockpot to avoid drying out and cut the second addition of butter because I forgot it. They turned out pretty tasty regardless!

Easy, Delicious. only challenge was they didn't heat up well in the slow cooker. I also saved the potato broth and used to thin it out a bit the next day. worked really well.

They did not taste much different than the ones I usually make, but it's the convenience of being able to make them ahead of time, taking one chore off my busy Thanksgiving cooking schedule that caused me to rate it 5 stars.

I simplified this recipe to just potatoes, sour cream, milk/cream, butter and salt/pepper...and then put into a greased 5 quart slow cooker insert and refrigerated.  4 hours before serving time I placed the insert into the slow cooker and cooked on low for about 4 hours.  Freed up the stove top and came out just great.

What a great recipe especially for Thanksgiving.  Everyone commented on how good they were.  Especially my neice who is highly picky.  This recipe made it to the recipe binder!  I used paper towels in place of the terry towel.  Only used approx. 6oz cream cheese and about that much sour cream.  Forgot the butter, one of my guest said they were perfect without it!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I was a little intimidated by the amount of fat the original recipe calls for, so I used the suggestions of others and bought fat-free sour cream and neufchatel cream cheese (33% less fat & softer than regular cream cheese).  Before mixing them into the potatoes I tried the fat-free sour cream and it is TERRIBLE.  It was time to cook so I quickly substituted Greek yogurt.  Instead of adding a lot of butter at the end, I added three big pats to the top of the potatoes when they were nearly done. Instead of minced garlic, I roasted a bulb and mashed it into the mix.  
They were great!  My husband, who has never had yogurt and never will, and probably can't even spell it, also thought they were great.  I've never seen him not add butter to mashed potatoes before pouring on the gravy (one reason I only make mashed potatoes on Thanksgiving), but he didn't add butter to these and didn't miss it.  This recipe's a keeper!

Enjoyed this method very much. Pretty much any mashed potato recipe could use this method. Keeping the potatoes warm in the slow cooker made serving time that much easier. No mashing at the last minute, etc. Just stir in that bit of butter and into a bowl they went. I didn't use a towel across the lid, and the potatoes were not soggy or wet. Didn't follow the recipe exactly. Had some shallot and chive Boursin so used that in place of the cream cheese. Worked out quite well. 8 thumbs up from our Thanksgiving dinner table.

I found these to be better then any mashed potato I ever had or made. The entire gathering for thanksgiving thought these were the best too. I left out the chicken bullion. Is the only change I made.

Just made these for Thanksgiving.  And from the mouths of my husband and my father "These are the best mashed potatoes I've ever eaten"!!  I feel the same way!  Followed the recipe to a "T" except I used golds since that's what I already had.  Will never make potatoes another way again!

Made these for Thanksgiving. I love that it frees up time because you can prepare them early. I forgot to add salt, pepper and butter! Lol. But I still loved the taste. I'll be making these every year now.

This recipe is so easy.  And absolutely delicious.  I made these a day ahead and then put in the crock pot 2 hours before Thanksgiving dinner was ready.  I did use russet instead of red potatoes and I did peel the potatoes.  Just one less thing to worry about Thanksgiving Day.

It was okay! but seemed like a lot more work and purchasing of ingredients I don't buy that often to get a similar flavor of my usual mashed potatoes. Potatoes, Whole Milk, Butter, Salt and Pepper. It works! and It's Good!

This is good recipe.  Although I screwed up and forgot to put in. The bullion cubes and garlic while boiling the potatoes.  So upset!  But when mashing them I used vegetable broth to get them to the right consistency and then add the garlic.  Worked out great.  I think next time I will use vegetable broth.  You do have to keep an eye on them though. When the crock pot starts steaming you may want to use a towel underneath the cover as other reviewers indicated so they do not get soupy.

I used plain yogurt instead of the sour cream and reduced the butter by a couple of tablespoons.  Also, I did not use the slow cooker.  Came out really delicious.

These were good and flavorful potatoes.  I don't think the crock pot is necessary to make them, but makes it a little easier if planning a big meal.  The flavor is not overbearing and does not need any additional toppings or gravy.  I would repeat these in the future.

I have had better mashed potatoes, but the difference isn't enough to stop me from doing this method when cooking for a large group.

Pretty darn good....and WAY easier method of prep than mashing and serving right away.  Maybe needs a little more seasoning though.....

I have been using an almost identical recipe that cooks in the oven instead of the slow cooker.  I'm never going back!   The slow cooker kept the potatoes creamy and hot.  It also freed up the oven for other things.  I made the potatoes a day in advance and just stored them in my slow cooker liner in the frig ( no extra container to clean and no time adjustment).  They were perfect.  I did use low fat cream cheese and sour cream.  Following other's advice I left out the butter and it wasn't missed.  My company and family loved them!

These were really good. They didn't blow anyone away but as a side to prime rib, they were all they needed to be. Making ahead was convenient.  I'm not sure why but there were tiny bits of something in our finished product (not potato lumps). I had used a Williams-Sonoma potato ricer to mash them. I didn't like the consistency so I had my sons pass them through a fine mesh strainer with a spatula and it solved the problem.

Delicious potatoes! Though one could argue that once the potatoes are done cooking in the boiling water, they're technically ready to eat, so we kept the cooker on low for about an hour, turned it off for an hour, then stirred and warmed it back up again. We also left out the sour cream (I didn't have any!), so I added milk. It was delicious!

Made these for Christmas dinner last year and was asked to bring them back! WOW! They were a hit and eveyone loved them. The hint about the towel to limit soggy was great. Followed a few others too. Will be making again this year! Thanks

These are amazing!  I followed other reviews and put a towel over the crock pot under the lid to help keep the moisture out of the potatoes.

I made good mashed potatoes before...everyone raved about them and I always had to bring them to family dinners (I added garlic cloves to the boiling water with the potatoes and sour cream and butter while mashing/whipping with electric beaters), but these were even better!!  I love the added chicken bouillon, (I added liquid to the water), and the cream cheese along with the sour cream.  I made these last weekend for my husband because I wanted to try them out before making them for Christmas with the family and he loved them!  Said they were better than my original ones which were hard to beat.  I can't wait to make them for the family at Christmas and see what they think.  I will write and let you know the general consensus.

My son and my heart daughter made these for Thanksgiving.  We had left over bacon from breakfast and my son chopped the bacon and added it to the potatoes the last 30 minutes before we planned to eat.  Fantastic!!  Best twice baked tasting potatoes I have ever had!!  Making them for a Christmas dinner this weekend...know they will be a huge hit!  Thanks for posting this recipe.

I did not like this recipe.  My potatoes were slightly chunky and juicy.  Even though there were edible, they were not what I had anticipated.  Overall, they tasted very good, just was not fond of the texture.

Very good on Thanksgiving and days later.  I would probably reduce the amount of cream cheese and sour cream a bit to make it a little less rich next time... but that is strictly my feeling, everyone enjoyed them as made.

Thanks!  Great flavor. I made it as written, except I added the boullion later.  Not sure why you need to use a slow cooker, it just adds more work and another pot to clean.

A hit on Thanksgiving, however my family kept asking what the purpose of putting them in the crock pot was for, and then they kept talking about another mashed potato recipe I make that they liked better.  I thought they were good, but I kind of agree, and the other recipe is better.

Made this for Thanksgiving dinner this year...WOW!  So easy (made the night before), and potatoes stay warm throughout dinner.  Brilliant!  I actually had to use white potatoes (live overseas and can't get red), and it was still wonderful.  Followed the recipe exactly (used Better than Bouillon rather than cubes..only difference), and they were delicious!  Will definitely make again!

Wonderful mashed potatoes, and even more wonderful was making them the day before Thanksgiving! I chose Yukon Gold potatoes and used a ricer for my mashed potatoes, for a nice creamy texture without any gumminess. I saved a jar of the potato water just in case...I refrigerated the potatoes overnight and put them in the crock pot on low for an hour, then switched to warm for 2 more hours, stirring 2 or 3 times. Perfect, I didn't need to add any of the potato water, and I used the whole stick of butter. Everyone loved these potatoes, thanks!

This was a huge hit at our Thanksgiving dinner yesterday. Since I was cooking for 20 ppl, I doubled the recipe and put in a large oval crockpot. Everyone raved about them and all the leftovers were send home with guests who wanted them later that night :) One even suggested she would make potato pancakes with them in the morning. Definitely a keeper -- especially to bring to a potluck.

This was incredibly easy!  I used Yukon Gold Potatoes (5 lbs), which I peeled and quartered ahead of time - put them in cold water and stored in the fridge until ready to boil.  Boiled for only about 15 minutes, and followed the recipe exactly.  Did save some potato water to moisten the potatoes in the crock pot whenever I stirred them.  They were in the crock pot about 2 1/2 hrs total and were perfect.  We did not add butter as we had a rich gravy.  I would definitely do this again.

I made these for my first Thanksgiving dinner, and they were a huge hit! My husband, who absolutely hates potatoes, even ate some without any gravy on them! I will definately keep this in my recipe arsenal!

I LOVE mashed taters! And sour cream and cream cheese.  Made this recipe verbatim.  While they're quite tasty, I thought the sour cream was a bit strong.  Will back off next time, as another reviewer wrote.  Suggest nuking crock to take off the chill after removing from the fridge, then put in crock warmer.  All they really need is some real bacon bits!

Perfect Potatoes!  Putting the cloth over the top is necessary to absorb the "steam" created by the crock pot.

These were awesome!  I made them for Thanksgiving this year and everyone commented.  Also very easy.  Made them the day before then on Thanksgiving turned the crockpot on and let them cook.  I did add a lot of the liquid the day before.  It might seem like it will make it water but its delish.  Also, like other reviewers, I didn't add any butter.  I doubled the potatoes and kept everything else the same and they were still very good.

What a wonderful recipe! I made this for the first time this Thanksgiving and what a time saver! I prefer Yukon Gold potatoes and they worked out great. I followed the great suggestions about stirring once in awhile and using a towel to prevent water dripping back into the potatoes. Thanks for the great recipe!

Probably the best mashed potatoes I have ever made! Used low fat cream cheese and sour cream. Used 2 cloves of minced garlic and a 5lb. bag of russets. I did spray my crockpot lightly with cooking spray. These potatoes were creamy, flavorful and so delicious. They stayed nice and hot in the crockpot on low. They were perfect. Thanks!

I'd give these three stars, because I didn't think the taste was anything overly extraordinary, but the idea of putting the potatoes in the slow cooker was really helpful in terms of Thanksgiving kitchen logistics so I'm going to give it 4 stars.

We tested this recipe as we thought about using it for Thanksgiving. It is very similar to a make-ahead potato recipe that i have traditionally made for Thanksgiving.  Hubby liked being able to make the potatoes in the crock pot. It is very good, we added some bacon bits and green onions as a topping, which I think tastes similar to a loaded baked potato. Yum. We will probably use the crock pot to make a sweet potato casserole recipe, but this is definitely staying in my recipe box for future use!

Yummy these are good! I love the idea of being able to make them ahead of time, plus they stay warm in the slow cooker throughout the meal. I put them in the slow cooker on high for 1 hour. The only thing I will change next time is I will NOT add the butter at the end. I will just put butter out and let people butter their own to their own taste. Overall a GREAT recipe!!

This was the first time I ever made home made mashed potatoes,  They were very easy and simple to make and they tasted wonderful as well.  Who would have thought you could make such wonderful potatoes in a crock pot.

This recipe is a keeper.  The potatoes turned out perfect.  I half expected the bottom to burn and it didn't.  I will always do my mashed potatoes this way.  Easy and just absolutely perfect.

I served these on Christmas and they were fantastic.  I doubled the recipe and my slow cooker was so full we didn't have room to put in the butter.  They were a success even without it, but I bet they would be so much better with it. They are a 4 1/2 star rating.

Very good.  Didn't even use butter as they tasted so good with out.  Boiling with garlic and chicken boulen adds soooo much flavor.

I did try these again except I used red potatoes (peeled) instead of russet. I mixed everything the night before and cooked on low for 4 hrs. the next day. Delicious and easy. Next time I will only add 1/2 the amount of sour cream to please my friends who don't like "sour" as much as I do. The 8oz cream cheese is fine but you could add more(4 oz.) if cuttingamount of sour cream. Creamiest mashed potatoes ever. And it is a plus to serve in slowcooker so they are good & HOT!

Very good and I loved the luxury of making these hours before dinner.  Less to do once the guests arrive.  My husband and I both thought they tasted better right after they were whipped, as opposed to after they were in the crock pot.

I agree, they are a lot of work, but for a special holiday, they are just distinct enough to put in the effort.  Love these potatoes and can't wait to make them for Thanksgiving.

I'm giving this 4 out of 5 only because following the recipe exactly makes my potatoes super runny.  haven't quite got the qty's down yet to make it nice and thick the way I want it - but the taste is good!

My family enjoyed these potatoes at Easter since they were a little more special.  Also for convenience, this recipe is great.  Keep an eye on your crockpot since mine cooked a little too fast and I had to add more liquid.

Only modification was to skip the butter (people can add as much as they like on their own plate), and used chive and onion cream cheese instead of the plain cream cheese.    This was a hit and so easy!

Loved them. The slow cooker method made it so much easier to get a smooth consistency to the mashed potatoes. Plus when cooking Thanksgiving dinner it's nice to just stick these in the slow cooker and you have one less thing to worry about.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was great!  Best mashed potatoes I've ever had.  I don't make it too often because it is loaded with calories, but it is great comfort food in the winter.  This is definitely a staple on our Thanksgiving table.

I can't believe I haven't reviewed these beofre! They are perfect! I cook the potatoes and garlic in low sodium chicken broth which gives a nice flavour. I also use low fat cream cheese and sour cream and taste no difference! Perfect for Christmas or Easter or Thanksgiving, I am craving them now!

These were very good.  I made them for the first Christmas we hosted and everyone loved them.  I left the skins on the potatoes, which people liked as well.  I was a little skeptical at first as they had a glue-like texture before I put them in the slow-cooker but they turned out wonderfully.   If I were to make them again, I would add a little horseradish as I did this with the left-overs and they were even better!

AWESOME! I have been reading reviews here for years and after preparing these potatoes for Thanksgiving this year,felt I had to write how wonderful they were. I used sour cream w/ chives. Everybody loved them. So easy to prepare and such a time saver when it comes to the last minute preparations.

Soooo good!  This stuff always is the first to go at pot lucks and dinner parties.  I put some of the MSG-free bullion powder directly into the potatoes, as well as some fresh garlic -- putting it into the cooking water just doesn't add any flavor for me.

Wow, these potatoes were very good. I was somewhat worried when the recipe did not have milk in it. The cream cheese and sour cream made up for the milk and then some. I made these for Thanksgiving - by using the slow cooker I was able to free up one of my 'spots' on the stove. So not only yummy, but also convenient!

These mashed potatoes were the best!  I made them the night before and all I had to do Thanksgiving day was heat them up in the crock pot.  I partially peeled the potatoes, and they were so pretty.  Everyone raved about them, and there were hardly any leftovers!  Thanks for the recipe!

I made my share of mistakes making this dish. I used a mixture od russett and red skined potatoes that tured out fine. I forgot to add the boulline (SIC) and garlic to the water so added that at the last minute then didn't have enough cream cheese but everything still tasted great. Got plenty of compliments. I made smatched potatoes and left the skins for nutional and person preference. Because of the calories in this dish I will make on holidays only but I have a feeling I will be asked to bring the potatoes every family gathering.

They tasted great!  They were way too runny, though for my taste.  Next time I would use less liquid, or more potatoes.

The crockpot idea works out nicely to free up some stove top space and help with timing for other food prep.

Otherwise, though, I didn't think the taste and texture was much different than the good ol' butter, milk, salt and pepper kind.  I don't think I will make this recipe again since the extra calories from the cream cheese and sour cream just really didn't give much "bang for the buck" in my opinion.

Excellent!  I added the butter with the rest of the ingredients, and they were delicious.  I really liked the texture.  I can't wait for leftovers today, and my girls are already asking for them!

I consider myself a mashed potato connoiseur and these are great - hard to mess up!  I have made the version with garlic/chive cream cheese as well and they turn out great.

These are the best mashed potatoes I have ever had. I made them for Thanksgiving and told my mom she was about to have to have the best mashed potatoes ever. She said no way hers were the best, after she ate them she agreed  with me. At Christmas I made them for friends and told them they were the best ever. My friend told me I was wrong that his mom's were, again he agreed with me after he ate them. Thank you so much for this recipe. It has become a family favorite.

We have made this several times now and it always gets huge compliments.
I tend to follow the recipe pretty much as is. I usually don't end up using quite as much butter but still use some. I add the butter with the rest of the dairy and don't bother with it at the end. 
I guess the biggest compliment is when people eat it without wanting to add gravy.
Being able to make it ahead and free up stove/counter space is a huge bonus. But, I have also made it at the last minute and it was still great.
Great recipe

This recipe was GREAT! We are usually always waiting for the potatoes to get done at our holiday meals. With this recipe I made the potatoes ahead of time and everything was done and hot on the table. I did use the clean towel trick to keep them from getting runny. I especially liked that the leftovers were just as tasty the second day as they were the first!

Best mashed potatoes ever! The potatoes are extremely moist.  And I love how versitile the recipe is.  You can add any seasoning and flavors you like, it's pretty much idiot proof.

We would give this 4 1/2 stars really.  Very tasty!  We added a ton more garlic though.  
"Slow Cooker" is a bit deceiving though. You do everything the way you normally would but now to throw it in a slow cooker to keep it warm - now you've dirtied up another dish!  If you're pressed for time I guess this is a good recipe.

I have made these twice now (Thanksgiving and Christmas) and everyone raved about them both times!  The potatoes are very easy to make and the best part is that they are done early.  I've made them with red potatoes and this last time with a mix of new potatoes and yukon gold because that's what I had.  Great with any potato probably.  I do use a little more butter than the recipe calls for and I leave the skin on.  So yummy!!

I did not peel the potatoes, I think that the skin provides a great texture and color.  These were the best mashed potatoes that I have ever eaten!  The cat is out of the bag...I will never be able to get away with instant mashed potatoes again!!!

Perfect mashed potatoes.  Tried it with regular russet potatoes and it came out just fine.  Doubled the recipe for Christmas dinner and it was completely gone.  Great made ahead recipe.

If there was a way to rate these a 10 I would! These are absolutely the best mashed potatoes in the entire world. I have cooked these in a pot, without having time to slow cook them, and they still turn out amazing. The best way is to slow cook them, but either way, this recipe is the BEST! I make these for every holiday, and get nothing but great compliments. Thanks for sharing such a yummy dish!!

Made these for Christmas dinner they were a big hit. My brother in law was still talking about them when he left! I left the skin on the potatoes which made them kind of festive.  They were a bit lumpy, but everyone still loved them. Not having a pot full of potatoes on the stove while cooking the turkey was terrific too!

Boil and then mash in crockpot with sour cream and cream cheese. Then run mixer through and add water to desired consistency. don't overdo it on the juice back in.

Oh my gosh- these are divine!!! I added a bit of sugar and garlic powder to the potatoes before putting them to the crock. They are so wonderfully creamy and a perfect companian to Bavarian Meatballs (from this site). Keeping them warm in the slow cooker is a great idea, yet delicious right from the boiling pot. My next go round will include a packet of veggie soup mix added to the recipe. Highly recommended!!!

Very tasty and it's so handy to be able to make them up ahead of time instead of right before serving the meal when there are other things to do - like visit with your guests.  I will make this recipe again.

Wonderful mashed potatoes.  I will never make mashed potatoes for a group any other way.  I made them the day before, then reheated them in the crock pot 3 hours before dinner.  The best part was the leftovers.  I usually hate to eat those dry and mealy potaoes the next day, but these stayed moist and flavorful for a whole week in the fridge.

a good basic mashed potatoe, but nothing that made it really great.  Using the slow cooker to keep it warm during Thanksgiving dinner was genius.

This recipe was perfect for 17 people on Thanksgiving, and it was a big hit.  I made them one day ahead, but forgot to put them in the crockpot in time to heat up before dinner.  So I microwaved them out of necessity, and then put them into the crockpot on high.  Still great.  I used half red and half russet potatoes with skin on.  Excellent.

LOVED being able to stick these in the crock pot and forget about them for a while, but thought they were a bit heavy.  I'll probably try them again and use Yukon gold potatoes.  The flavor was good (you'll need lots of salt and pepper for five pounds of potatoes!).

The cream cheese was a little hard to mix in, even though I had it at room temperature. My guests loved this dish more than I did...I felt it was too dense and not fluffy enough. Also, I only added about 2/3 of the amount of cream cheese. If I make this recipe again, I'll probably use Yukon gold potatoes.

These really were very tasty. The best part was being able to get them in the crockpot dish the night before and just having them over in the corner on Thanksgiving day not needing stove or oven space. I'll be making these every holiday now. Thanks for sharing!

I love this recipe because it gets the potatoes out of the way. I make them the night before and just set the crock pot bowl in the refrig. Next day take them out put them in the crock and your done.
don't have to worry about making room on the stove or oven. Just stir them up alittle very now and then and they are piping hot to serve.

These are amazing potatoes!  For the first time ever I have opted to not put gravy on them, it would take away from them.  I did not have red potatoes on hand so I just used the regular kind (even though I prefer red and they are very different from the normal potato).  I slow cooked them in my Crock Pot for two hours on low but noticed that they were getting scorched on the sides so I had to turn it off completely (my pot does not have a warm setting).  I really am not sure why they need to cook in a slow cooker except to get them piping hot so next time an hour in the cooker should be plenty of time.  These are out of this world, I will never cook a potato any other way!  Thank you for sharing this recipe with us.

I believe I used to much water and that it might have dilluted the bouillon and garlic flavor a bit. I did make them pretty close to how the recipe has suggested and people really enjoyed them. I used everything Organic (russet potatoes, butter, sour cream and so on)  accept the cream cheese and I was pleased. This was my very first time to make mashed potatoes and I must say that it seemed I was making a mountain out of a mole hill because they were super simple to make.

This recipe was just ok for me.  I usually get the same results without the slow cooker.  I really didn't taste a difference with the slow cooker, except alot of extra cooking time.

These turned out fantastically for Thanksgiving!  I hosted this year at 8 mos. pregnant and had our sides in 3 slow cookers.  This recipe was in one of them.  At first the family was a little dubious, but everyone loved them!  Thanks for this great recipe for someone who needed to take things more slowly this year. :)  Oh, and they turn into FANTASTIC potato soup with a little leftover half and half, leeks, and chicken broth.

We really enjoyed this recipe although, I did not make it in the slow cooker. I boiled the potatoes and mashed them right away. I also added shredded Cheddar Cheese when I mixed the potatoes. It turned out quite tasty.

These are the best mashed potatoes.  I have always made them this way but this was the first time putting them in the crockpot.  I too used the cloth under the lid and had to turn to crock down to warm.  Everyone was truly amazed how good they were.  I know it was because they were hot, and stayed hot for seconds.  I only added about 4 T of butter, used FF sour cream and FF cream cheese and they were perfect.

These were delicious, but the best part was I threw them in the crock pot and forgot about them!  They tasted every bit as good as my famous garlic mashed potatoes, but 10 times easier to make.  I wish I could give this a 10!

Absolutely delicious! First, I have to say, they are much better reheated the next day!! Definitely follow others advice: add some garlic salt to the mashed potatoes before they hit the crock pot and use towel/paper towel under the lid to collect the moisture.. This will be a regular at our house!

Easy and yummy. A little chunky for me but my fiance' loved them. If you want them smoother you can use a mixer. I don't have one yet. Also used fat free sour cream and low fat cream cheese.

What a fantastic way to get ahead of the game when you're trying to make a big meal!  The leftovers heat up nicely too.  I took the advice of using a towel on top to absorb the steam and we didn't use any butter after they were cooked.  I will use a garlic flavored cream cheese the next time I make these.  I bet that would make it even better!

These are so yummy and I loved having the mess done, and out of the way, early! They stayed nice and hot all throught dinner and every at the party wanted the recipe. I used half the butter and tried the towel trick shared by another reader to soak up the moisture. It worked great. These are my potatoes from now on!

Good recipe!  I don't use chicken bouillons, though.  Have made my potatoes this way for years but this is the first time in the crock-pot.  Was nice not to have to try and "time" the potatoes to be ready the same time as the turkey being served.  No trouble with potatoes being mushy, just have to be careful with the amount of water/milk that you add while mashing them.

These potatoes turned out perfect. And it was so much easier doing them in the crock pot on Thanksgiving instead of having to make them at just the right time to put on the table. They stayed creamy and had a very nice flavor. I'll probably add seasonings next time, just because of personal tastes, but we did them just like the recipe for Thanksgiving day and they were pleasing to every one.

Excellent flavor and so nice to be able to cook them ahead. I added a little too much water to the finished product but the leftovers soaked it right up.  My husband loved them.

This was a great dish, but I feel it needed some gravy or additional garlic butter to make it GREAT...  

This is what I did:
- Cubed red potatoes the night before to cut down on Thanksgiving-day prep time
- Boiled potatoes with salt and lots of garlic
- Mashed potatoes with low-fat sour cream, garlic & herb cream cheese, veggie stock, and white wine
- Cooked on low for 3 hours

Potatoes were hot and creamy, but lacked something...this is why I recommend either a light turkey gravy or some serious garlic butter to complete the dish.  ENJOY!

Fantastic potatoes.  I reduced the butter by 1/2 and these were just great.  Everyone loved them.  I did put them in the crock pot, but they didn't get watery.  I didn't add much of the cooking water at all though.  Maybe that is what gave them the perfect consistency.

I loved this recipe!! It was very easy, and they stayed warm throughout our Thanksgiving meal!!! Kids really loved 'em! I added a little more salt n pepper, but other than that followed recipe, and they were great. Maybe next time will add cheese or crumbled bacon, or both!

Good.  Didn't feel like recipe needed that much sour cream and cream cheese.  Seems like they were missing something.
But this recipe can be very flexable...could use green onions folded in at the end, or cheddar cheese for another twist, bacon.  :o)  The crock pot thing is a nice idea!

This recipe is great-no oven time. If you reds like I did, no need to peel. Some extra nutrition, and it looks better with bits of the peel mixed throughout. At the end, do remember to season to taste.

I made this for my first Thanksgiving yesterday and I was SO HAPPY with these potatoes. Everyone asked for the recipe, they were streaming hot for the whole meal-Can't say enough about how good these were. Def don't need the butter though, I didn't put any in and they turned out creamy.

What a great holiday recipe! When I whipped the potatos, they were a little loose - but 2 hours in the slow cooker and they were firm, not dry or cakey. Everyone loved them.

I made these for Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved them.  My father-in-law even said they were "every bit as good as something you'd get in a restaurant."  I loved that I could make them ahead of time and keep them warm in the crock while I cooked everything else.  I didn't have quite as much cream cheese or sour cream called for but they were still super rich and yummy.  One extra thing I did was save the broth I cooked the potatoes in and used it to cook my green beans in.  It gave them really good flavor!

Made this for Thanksgiving.  It was pretty good.  However I think I prefer the more plain mashed potatoes I'm used to, which uses just milk and butter.  If I make these again, I think I will halve the amount of cream cheese.  It was a little too noticeable in the potatoes.

This recipe was great! I, too, didn't add the butter...it just didn't need it. And, I left the skins on, also. This was sooo easy and they tasted great! Thanks so much for sharing this one!!! It's a keeper!

I was surprised how well these potatoes turned out, I thought the slow cooker would dry them out after 3 hours.  They had a nice texture and a great flavor.

I love this recipe! It is so easy and so very tasty! I love finally having a way to keep the potatoes warm while other things are cooking. This is also a great dish when you have a lot of people. Super easy and super delicious! Thanks!

Amazing potatoes! I used gold potatoes and didn't bother with the crock pot part, just boiled them until they were very tender. I cut back a little on the cream cheese and sour cream and added some Morton's seasoning salt as well. Delicious! My fiancée and I ate nearly a pan by ourselves. Will definitely make these again! Thanks!

I had dinner guest coming so I didn't want to be stuck in the kitchen mashing potatoes. This was the perfect recipe. It was super easy, they stayed hot, and they tasted fantastic. My husband is very picky and hard to please but he loved them... thats why it gets 5 star!!! I followed exactly.

I get so frustrated on Thanksgiving and holidays when my potatoes are cold and there is no good way to warm them up.  These are incredible!  I used regular everything but next time I will try with all lower fat.  I think they will be great!!!

These are the best mashed potatoes I have ever had, they are so rich and creamy!  I deviated from the recipe slightly by adding extra garlic and some chicken rub seasoning to the boiling water.  I also used low-fat sour cream and cream cheese.  These will be a staple in my household, especially during the holiday season.

My kids, who are mashed potato freaks, loved this dish & went back for seconds and thirds. I myself thought that the cream cheese was a little heavy and will reduce it by half next time.

These were great!  I would make these again for a large or busy dinner, because once they are in the slow cooker you don't have to think about them until serving time and they are still warm (Christmas-Thanksgiving.)  But for an ordinary dinner it's an extra dish that needs washing.

Do you stay away from mashed potatoes cause the last thing you want to do before you sit down to dinner is make a huge mess while everything is getting cold, including the potatoes?  Everyone loves them cause they taste great! I love them cause they are easy, stay hot and there is no last minute clean-up!  I will never make mashed potatoes the traditional way again.  The only thing I did was half the cream cheese cause my family isn't a big fan.  The best part is they stay hot through the entire meal.  I keep them in the crock pot to serve.

These are delicious! My whole family raved over these at Christmas dinner,even my sister-in-law who doesnt like mashed potatoes. I will now make these everytime I make mashed potatoes from scratch. I did use light sour cream,light cream cheese AND light butter and they were INCREDIBLE. True comfort food. The best! Thanks for the recipe!

These are great!  Great for dinners, potlucks, weeknights, whenever you want mashed potatoes!  
I needed to take in a potato dish for a holiday office party and used this.  I made the potatoes up until the last step the night before & just kept them in the slow cooker crock.  The next morning when I got to work, all I had to do was just turn on the slow cooker.  They tasted great!

These were awesome and so helped when making all the fixings for Thanksgiving dinner not to last minute have to mix up the potatoes.

This is a great time saver for the holidays.  Not only did it taste fantastic, but it helps minimize all the last minute scurrying to get the dinner on the table.  I usually make mine with cream cheese anyway, but loved the idea of getting it done and out of the way and able to keep it hot in the crock pot until the rest of the dinner is ready.

I made this recipe for the first time for Thanksgiving this year and got a lot of compliments on it!  I added only about 1/2 of the reserved water until I got a consistency that I liked (by adding a little at a time), and added 8oz of shredded romano and 8oz of grated parmesan to give it some kick.  Will definily make this again!

YUM, YUM, YUM.  Great recipe that made my hubby sing my praises. I omitted the garlic since my baby was going to be eating mashed potatoes for the first time and it was still great.  Have even microwaved leftovers with a pat of butter and cannot complain.  First time I've ever made real mashed potatoes and was super easy for this newbie to make!

SOOOOO YUMMY!!!  I used russets.  Don't skip the crockpot step because it gives it a wonderful texture and consistency.  And if you have a large crockpot, double the recipe.  Trust me, nothings going to waste.

These were sure a hit last weekend! Even people who said they hate sour cream loved them!!  I did use regular idaho potatoes (peeled)instead of red.  I love the fact that they can be made early in the day & finished at meal time.

Good recipe, made last night with Anniversary Chicken - good combo.  I can't say as this is an awsome and exciting recipe but it is good.  This is going to be great for the holidays, though when oven room is hard to come by, I will definately use again.

These should come with a warning. Highly addictive!! I only changed one thing -- I use 1 Tbsp. chicken bouillon granules instead of the cubes since I'm allergic to MSG.

Delicious!! I did omit all of the butter because I thought...as did everyone else who ate these...that the potatoes were just perfect with the sour cream and the cream cheese. I also grabbed a very big handful of chives from the garden, chopped them up and threw them in. Great recipe; thank you so much!!!

These were great as far as convenience goes, but they seemed to be lacking something. My husband commented he likes my plain old normal mashed potatoes much better. I did like them, so I will probably keep the recipe around, maybe just try some other tyoe of potato next time. Thank you for this unique idea of being able to finish them in the crock pot, I really appreciate the convenience it provided for my Easter dinner! Thanks again!

From all the reviews, I expected better. These were good though. I added fresh chives and green onion to the mix. They still tasted a little bland. They do melt in your mouth and stay warm throughout your meal. I will make these again probably trying other taters and adding more garlic, maybe some cheddar cheese too. Thanks for the recipe.

This was a hit at our house. The only thing I changed was I did only use about 1/2 cup of butter.  It really did not need too much at all. They turned out real smooth and creamy. We loved these potatoes.

I have made this twice; the first time, it wasn't that great, but I didn't thin the potatoes with the cooking water enough and I left them on too long. I tried again following the recipe exactly, and they came out perfectly! Everyone loved and raved about them, and left me plenty of counter space!

Taste was a little bland, but I think that was due to the kind of potatoes used.  Next time I may switch to Yukon Gold.  But my husband loved it anyhow, and he's the mashed potatoe king!

What a great idea - really freed up other cooking areas for the rest of my Thanksgiving dinner.  Everyone loved them and I will definitely make this again.

Great mashed potato's and a nice treat not to be scrambling last minute trying to have them ready when meat is done. I used clean thin skinned white potato's with skins on and added chopped green onion. Made a full small crockpot, 2 meals for 4.

This was a gret recipe. I modified it a little though. When I added the butter at the end I also added Onion & Chive Cream Cheese (to taste). But all in all this was a gret recipe!

The potatoes had little taste when added to the crock pot.  I added garlic powder and seasoned salt for taste.  My husband added hot sauce and loved it.

I just finished cleaning up from the aftermath of Canadian Thanksgiving at my house, and the one thing that didn't take long to clean up after was the Potato pot.  My Family just loved these! This is a recipe I will be using again and again. I followed the recipe exactly.  Very nice that it frees up time and space, extremely easy and was a big hit! Thank you for the recipe!

Update 09/2011: I make these every Thanksgiving (and some Christmases depending on the menu) and get RAVE reviews every time. In current years I get people asking if I'm making "those awesome mashed potatoes". THEY REALLY ARE THAT GOOD!!

03/2005 Sooo good! My whole family LOVED these!

Great recipe. Fairly easy to make and very yummy.  The crock pot is mainly used to just keep the already cooked mashed potatos warm.  A Keeper!

YUMMY!  Although a very heavy dish (note the high fat ingrediants), was a big hit.  Not the recipe I would use on a regular basis, but for sure a recipe I would use on special occasions!

Excellent recipe!  I actually kept the potatoes in the crock pot for about 5 hours on warm.  They turned out fantastic and it was great to be able to enjoy my company rather than waste my time mashing potatoes at the last minute.  Thanks!

These are good, but instead of the sour cream, use 8 oz. french onion dip, or be adventurous and use bacon horseradish dip.  Now we're talkin'.  Better make a bunch!

I fixed both ways... with and without the crockpot. Without the crockpot, I boiled the potatoes for a little longer. The recipe is fantastic either way!

I thought these potatoes were delicious, but I skipped the crock pot step as I read in another review.

This comes out soooooo creamy!!!!!  WOW!  This is great because a lot of times when making mashed potatoes it's the last thing you end up making because they need to be hot!  You can make this and they will stay warm until you need them!  I love it!  Thank you for the recipe!

I only used 4 ounces of cream cheese and substituted canned chicken broth instead of the chicken granules. Everyone loves it and I've never had any leftover. A definite make ahead crowd pleaser.

This recipe was a hit this past Thanksgiving which was a potluck.  Perfect for the crockpot to keep warm.  I have also used this recipe for stovetop because the flavor is FANTASTIC!!!!

These have a good taste, but my children were not crazy about them. I also didn't see the purpose of the slow cooker.

Great Recipe! I did wonder why I'd go to so much trouble for mashed potatos, but it was worth it. My mom reheated the leftovers and thought they were the best mashed potatos ever!

Absolutely the best!!!  Unlike the others, I wouldn't change a thing about the recipe.  While not an everyday side dish due to the calories and fat, it is a perfect when you want to indulge and be naughty.  Whole family loves them.

Great for all the reasons noted by other reviews; but I've got to tell you I have some difficulty thinking about all the additional fat I infused in the humble red potatoes. Next time I will use less butter, fat free cream cheese and sour cream even if it means compromising flavor a little.  I suspect they would still would be very good.

These are great!  I'm a huge fan of anything in the slow cooker.
