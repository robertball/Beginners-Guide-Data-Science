My new favorite!!! I used a whole fryer, reserving ALL of the broth and straining it. Many other reviewers said to add 1 cream of chicken and 1 cream of mushroom soup, and that's what I did. I also used chicken broth instead of water for the saucepan mixture. I also added 1/4 tsp. garlic powder and 1/4 tsp onion powder, and I salted and peppered to taste as well. I boiled Angel Hair pasta 16 oz. in the remaining chicken broth, It made ALL the difference in the world! I used a Kroger brand cheese, they have a wonderful medium sharp cheddar, yum! To top off the cheese I sprinkled a little Progresso Italian style bread crumbs over all(another reviewersuggestion). I think you could lay some broccoli, or some other green on top of pasta and pour chicken mixture on top of that and have a one dish meal. I also think I remember that from another reviewer, thanks. The recipe I had was SO bland, but not this one, full of flavor! Oh, and I did put in mushrooms and it was wonderful!!! Thanks so much for the new addition to my recipe box. I am not a creative cook that throws in a pinch of this and a little of that, I cook strictly from recipies 80% of the time, so these reviews from everyone really help me. Thank you to EVERYONE!!!

After reading the reviews I realized what a great base recipe Marion has provided.  You add or delete to your personal preference.  I like to cut my chicken breast into cubes while frozen since it's easier to cut and it makes less mess and let them thaw in fridge.  I added lemon pepper, garlic powder, a little salt and fresh ground black pepper to ziplock bag with chicken and tossed to coat.  I used one tbsp of butter and 2 tbsp of olive oil and sauteed chicken till just about cooked through.  In place of the bouillon and water I also used low sodium chicken broth.  I used 1 can of cream of mushroom and 1 can of cream of chicken 99% fat free since I only had one can of each on hand.  I also diced up a small onion and added one can of mushrooms.  This turned out really good so thanks again Marion for a recipe that can be tweaked to everyones preference.

This was the best chicken tetrazzini I've ever had!  I used boneless skinless chicken breast, cut into small pieces and seasoned with lemon juice, paprika, rosemary, thyme, oregano, minced garlic, and black pepper.  I also used whole wheat spaghetti, and one can cream of chicken and one cream of celery.  Preparing the soup according to the directions, I was worried that the dish would be too liquidy, but it was perfect.  SO flavorful and good!  As other reviewers have noted, it might be a little bland if you prepare it as written, without customizing with your favorite spices.  For me, the seasonings I used in baking the chicken worked out perfectly for seasoning the tetrazzini.  This is a recipe I'll definitely make again.  Thank you!

Like others, I used 1 can Cream of Mushroom, 1 can Cream of Chicken and 1 3/4 cups of the broth from boiling the chicken, also added 1 1/2 teaspoons of chicken soup base.  To the soup mixture I added 1 small can of sliced mushrooms, 1/2 bag frozen peas, 2 TBS butter, about a teaspoon of garlic salt, 1 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper, some seasoning salt, and about a tablespoon of dried parsley.  Cooked the soup mixture to heat then then added the cooked spaghetti right into the pot to mix.  Poured all into a baking dish - - topped with cheddar cheese and baked. I also took others advice to add buttered ritz cracker crumbs to the top - - I did this in the last 10 minutes of baking.  Overall turned out good - - You really need to dress this one up a bit - - I think it would be pretty plain without the extras.  My boys didn't like the cheddar cheese on top because it got a little hard -- next time maybe I'll mix the shredded cheese into the noodle mix before baking?

Slight variations: use egg noodles or corkscrew pasta in place of the spaghetti (it holds the sauce better), you really only need to use one bullion cube (lowers the sodium in this recipe drastically! still great flavor), DO NOT USE LOW FAT OR FAT FREE SOUP! ( DOES NOT MAKE FOR CREAMY CONSISTENCY).Mix cheddar cheese w/ 1/4 cup (or more if you like) Italian flavored bread cumbs for crunchy browned topping!

Just a request to the very kind ladies (or men) who take the time to write reviews that change (or augment) the recipes. We rookies that cook for out ladies (my case) often copy these recipes. In my case, I almost always copy half a dozen of your comments along with the recipes to help me improve the dish…and it usually works out great. So my hat’s off to you. So when you say that you’ve added “herbs,” please write what herbs you have added or in other words be specific as to what you have done. You can’t imagine how helpful your comments are to guys like me lacking your years of experience with this. Thanks again.

Very good and wow! It makes alot (as others have warned)! I used fettucini noodles (broken in half) b/c I'm all out of spaghetti and the first thing I thought this dish needed was a little color from some veggies. When melting the butter (B4 adding the soups), I added some fresh/sliced mushrooms, some chopped celery, minced onion, and some chopped green bell pepper. I sauted them for a few min until soft and then added the soup. Also, I used 2c water and added 1/4c white wine. Finally, when mixing it all together, I added a jar of diced pimentos and a little more sharp cheddar cheese. Very basic recipe that allows you to easily add/subtract and the result was very tasty! Thanks Marian!

I gave this a 5 because it was sooo good and so simple to make. I did add some onion, garlic,red pepper and broccoli to the chicken when cooking to make it healthier, and also some spices as well.  Instead of water I added chicken broth. It was very tasty and not bland at all.

AWESOME RECIPE! HUSBAND SEASONED WATER W/SEASONED SALT, PEPPER, GARLIC POWDER, AND ONION POWDER THEN BOILED CHICKEN. I USED THE SAME WATER TO BOIL THE NOODLES. REALLY KICKED UP THE FLAVOR. ALSO USED 98% FAT FREE SOUP FOR A LIGHTER RECIPE.  ONLY 6 WW POINTS PER SERVING.

Very delicious dish and so easy to make!  I tweaked the recipe a bit for more flavor.  I shredded my chicken instead of cubes.   Boiled 4 chicken breasts in a pot of water and added chicken boullion cubes.  Let the chicken boil at a medium simmer for 3 hours.  The longer it boils the easier it shreds. Use A LOT of water so you can use it for boiling the spaghetti and for the rest of the recipe.  1 can cream of chicken, 1 can cream of mushroom.  Added chopped celery and chopped broccoli and chopped red bell pepers.  Instead of water I used the broth from the boiled chicken.  Also used part of the chicken broth to cook the spaghetti (what a difference!)   Mixed the soup mixture, added the veggies and the shredded chicken into one large pot to boil and them mixed throughly.  Pour over pasta and mix.    Added sharp chedder cheese (not too much because you don't want  it to be overly cheesy.  Last 10 mins add crushed ritz crackers or bread crumbs.  So delicious and makes a lot!!!  Great leftovers - even tastier the next day!!

This was pretty good.  Rating recipe as is...I did alot to spruce it up which means this recipe isn't all that great.  Im scared to know what it would take like without all the seasoning I added.  After it was all said and done, my husband said it was good just needed some pepper.

The first time I made this, I made it exactly according to the recipe (except halving it) and I thought it was so-so, but had potential, so I made my own version, with leftovers from a roast chicken. I put the cream of chicken (low sodium this time), water, boullion, butter, and the not-fat part of the pan drippings from a roast chicken (cool it and scrape the fat off) in a saucepan and set to simmer, then added the meat from two chicken thighs/legs, chopped into smallish bits. I let that simmer while the spaghettic cooked, then made the rest as normal except subbed panko bread crumbs for the cheddar cheese. It was YUM! I know, it's not really even the same recipe anymore, but it was so good I had to share!

Easy, but needs sseasoning. This always happens when I follow the recipe too literally. I forgot to season the chicken before cooking it. As a result, the chicken was very bland and it taste like cream of chicken soup over pasta. I gave it 4 stars because it was easy and would have been very good if the chicken was seasoned. I also substituted spiral pasta for the spaghetti (it holds the sauce better). And I addded fresh mushrooms. I might add peans next time because I intend to try it again.

My family loved this recipe, however I altered it...I used cream of chicken soup, milk instead of water, added a couple tablespoons of sour cream, garlic, 2 types of cheese, and Italian bread crumbs on the top. I baked 20 minutes and broiled on high for 2 minutes.

Yummy!  My whole family really enjoyed this.  The only thing that I did different from the original recipe was to mix the spaghetti with the sauce and chicken before adding it to the baking dish.  I added half of this mixture to the dish and added a good layer of parmesan cheese then the rest of the pasta mixture and a good layer of extra sharp cheddar.  We will have this again and again!

I made this for a crowd of 20 and it was a hit! I followed the recipe and adjusted it according to the reviews. I sautéed the chicken in butter and added chicken stock, celery, onion, garlic, sweet red peppers as some suggested. After it was cooked, I drained the chicken and discarded the vegetables.  The chicken was tender and flavorful.  In making the soup base, I used half cream of mushroom and half cream of chicken soups like most reviewers suggested.  I also added onion salt, minced garlic, a little cayenne pepper, chicken broth, and white cooking wine (in place of water)to the soup mixture. When I added the cheddar cheese, I mixed it in like several suggested and topped the dish with some additional cheddar cheese, parmesan cheese and butter pats.  
The results were wonderful--very tasty. Several asked for the recipe. If I make this for just my family, I would add broccoli or another green vegetable.  I'll definitely make this again.  Great for a carry in dinner.

This was really good!  I am in Italy right now so I had to compromise a bit:  Instead of chicken bouillon or even condensed chicken soup, I used Chicken Broth.  This would have been fine, had I not read the instructions on the tin: 1 scoop per person.  So, I was cooking for two people and used half a tin :S  OOOPS.  Otherwise, everything was perfect.  I took a lot of hints from reviews: I didn't broil the chicken, I sauteed it first on a bed of olive oil, with lemon juice, paprika, oregano, black pepper, fresh garlic, onion powder.  In the noodle water I added paprika, sea salt, pepper, and onion powder.  I added sliced mushrooms and onions to the "broth" mixture, and used egg noodles.  Voila!  Very tasty (minus my own salt issue with the 1/2 tin of chicken broth).  Will for sure make this again!

I made this and it was immediately a hit.  I tweeked it a great bit though since previous reviews stated that it tasted bland.  I sauted the chicken and seasoned it with my mix of seasonings (seasoning salt, garlic powder, onion powder, lemon pepper.  I also added 1/2 pound of smoked sausage to the chicken as it was sauteing.  When it came to the sause I added a can of cream of chicken instead of two cans of cream of mushroom.  I also added another bouillon to the sauce.  One the sauce started boiling I added the seasoned chicken and sausage. (I also had sauteed a can of drained mushrooms with butter and added to the chicken and sausage) and let it boil for a few mins to add some of the flavor from the chicken and sausage.  I also added a bag of fozen peas and carrots to give it some color and vegetables.  I also mixed it all together before pouring in the pan and used kraft Casserole cheese on top instead of the Cheddar.  EVERYONE loved it and it turned out great!

Yum, this is the first time I ever had chicken tetrazzini and it was great! I cut the recipe in half since it's just me and my husband. I used angel hair pasta and followed the directions to a "T."  The only thing I added was a sprinkling of Italian bread crumbs on top of the cheddar cheese.

This was a good recipe.  I followed it with one exception - I used cream of celery instead or cream of chicken because it's all I had.  I liked it quite a bit, though it was a little bland.  One daughter was sold on it because it's spaghetti.  The other daughter didn't go for it.

If you like salt, and don't need salt again for another week-make this recipe, but cut the salt in half and you'll still find this dish freakin salty!!!  Are there any other spices in your life other than salt? This recipe is overly simplistic because it relies too heavily on the one flavour.  Instead of cream of chicken soup, you should use cream of mushroom soup and leave out the bouillon cubes. The noodles are wrong-use Bowtie pasta and maybe some fresh peppers in it would make it have a fresher taste. I'm going to be retaining water for days!

The word "easy" normally means to stay away from on here because it is just a poor recipe with an excuse to be since it's fast.  But this recipe is sooooo good.  I've tried doing it "fancier" with other recipes and they rarely turn out as good as this one.  Plus the other recipes take twice the amount of time.  Thanks for such a delicious and fast recipe for one of my favorite meals.

To bland for my family and I.  It's missing something. Need some kind of spices added to it.

This is a really great, versatile comfort food. I like to use a rotisserie chicken and shred the meat. I saute chopped onion and garlic and add to 2 cream of mushroom soups. Any pasta will work, but we prefer the vermicelli. I also stir the cheddar cheese in with the entire dish so that it doesn't get hard on top. Yummy!

I never write reviews even though I use recipes from this site all the time. Also, I rarely cook with canned soups ( high sodium and preservatives) and neither my husband nor I indulge in second helpings of almost any dinner. Let me tell you, I just finished my third helping of this and am considering a fourth. This is TRUE back-to-your-childhood comfort food. As other reviewers noted, it's a basic "make it your own" so I added minced peppers, onion and garlic powder, broth instead of water and cream of mushroom and cream of chicken.  Next time I will add broccoli. Cheese and breadcrumbs on top, YUM.

This went over so well in my house, that I am often asked when I'll be making it again. I love how budget friendly it is, which is always the biggest factor in the "what's for dinner?" decision.

The recipe as written is just 3 stars, but is fantastic with a few additions. I halved the recipe and used 2 cans of chicken (short on time). I put the chicken in the saucepan with the butter and a tbsp of garlic, and sauted for a couple minutes. Then, I added a heaping tbsp of sour cream to the soup mixture, as well as garlic salt, onion powder, and pepper. I also added a can of mushrooms and peas, and topped with the cheese and Italian bread crumbs. The fiance loved it, and so did I! Very flavorful and perfect for a cold night.

Nice easy meal. Kids like it. I'm not crazy about the cream soup. I would like it better if made with a real homemade cream sauce or something. But it's good for a quick and easy weeknight meal.

I gave this 4 stars because I had to modified the way that I made it. I used 1 can cream of chix, 1 can cream of potato, 1 can corn, and I added 1/2 tbsp of crushed garlic, some parsley, and salt and pepper to taste. It turned out really good but I think without these modifications it would have been pretty bland. I will make this again experimenting with spices and veggies.

used the suggestion to use 1 can cream of celery and 1 can cream of chicken and instead of water 1 cup half and half and 1 1/4 cup milk. I thought the dish had a very good flavor. Everyone liked it. My husband suggested a little more sauce so next time I'm going to add one more can of cream of 'something' and a little more half and half.

Thanks for this Easy recipe. I had no trouble at all whipping this up last night. Not only did my mom and boyfriend go back for seconds but my boyfriend took a serving home and asked for the recipe. The small things I did differently are season the water that I boiled the chicken in with two bouillon cubes and the spaghetti with one, added mushrooms, a small can of pimento and more cheese (only because my family is super cheese freaks)! Thanks!

This was a Very easy and good recipe. we added mushrooms but you don't have to. We did add some shredded cheddar cheese inside the pasta mixture and I feel like it MADE this taste just like a tetrazzini. We also added extra cheese on top and then some bread crumbs on the very top. It was fabulous! We will be keeping this recipe.

This is a great recipe. It tastes every bit as good as my traditional version of chicken tetrazzini with half the work! I prefer to mix everything up together in the drained pasta pot with the sauce and then pour it all into the baking dish. I will add peas and canned mushrooms next time. I substituted Parmesan cheese for the cheddar cheese, but that's just my preference. This is probably the version of chicken tetrazzini that I will use from now on. Thanks, Marian for sharing!

We really liked this dish but the next time I'm going to add some things   .Adding some onions and red bell peppers would be good and for some color. We like spicy so also  some hot pepper flakes.  Overall very good and will be making it again.

Really loved this recipe. I didn't have any chicken so I used some turkey breast instead and used 1 can cream of mushroom and 1 can cream of chicken instead of both cans being cream of chicken. I also added frozen peas as well for nutrition and color. I also need to mention we used a whole 8 oz. bag of shredded cheddar cheese. Overall, it was one crowd pleasing meal with my family. There are plenty of leftovers for us to take for lunch the next day as well. Good recipe!!!!!

This recipe was super easy.  I subbed a can of cream of mushroom soup for one can of cream of chicken. (I just had one, but it worked out well.)  I also added ground chicken because I was using the remnants of chicken from the night before.  (Also my husband thought the ground chicken looked interesting in the store, so I had that on hand.) The roasted chicken was the better part but ground chicken helped stretch the meat distribution.  I added freshly chopped onions, garlic and celery with fresh ground black pepper.  I boiled angel hair pasta in low sodium chicken broth instead of using bouillon.  I used broth instead of water.  I  added seasoning salt to dish.  But if you are looking for a low sodium dish, maybe you would not need.  This recipe serves more than 8 servings.  I have a GREEDY family of five and everyone were stuffed with enough for everyone to have a serving the next day, I guess.  But upon waking, I learned that the crowd had either finished it off or brought it to work for lunch. ::::Empty casserole::::

It looked like a dish on the cover of a magazine.  I was going to take a picture but the crowd had already started digging in.

I read the reviews and decided to do what others had already done: 
diced frozen chicken breasts
seasoned the chicken with adobe pepper, garlic powder, lemon peel, and cilantro (pretty much what I pulled out of the cabinet, went on the chicken!).  Then I cooked it in olive oil (Pam spray).  I used chicken broth instead of the water, and omitted the chicken bouillon.  Then I added crushed club crackers and topped it off with shredded cojack cheese.  My family definitely want this again!  It is a great base recipe that you can easily adapt to your taste!

This was a great dish.  Takes a little prep time cooking the chicken and pasta ahead of time, but the result is delicious.  

Only difference is that we added salt/pepper to the chicken when we cooked it and added more cheddar cheese.  

This will be a favorite!

Very good basic recipie. Definetlely will make agian. I used 1 can cream of mushrooms and 1 can cream of chicken. Added diced onion, about 1 1/2 cups of frozen peas, 1 can kroger mushroom pieces no salt(could use 2), couple tablespoons garlic powder, 1 tablespoon pepper, smart balance butter, and wyler's no sodium chicken bouillon, plus about 3oz sharp cheddar on top.

I also simmered the chicken breast, not boiled, then used some of the water for the broth, then cooked the pasta in the rest. And also mixed all the ingredients together in the pot, minus the cheese and pasta. One thing I will do next time is put  sauce/chicken mix onto the pasta immediately after putting the pasta in the dish. I let the pasta sit to long and it kind stuck together to much, calling for a little, no, a lot of stabbing to get the sauce to seep down. Was definitely a FULL 13x9!

I had higher expectations with the high ratings.  I thought it was ok.  Kind of bland.  Next time I make tetrazzini I will search for more of a cream sauce rather than soup.

My entire picky family LOVED this!  I added 1/2 bag of peas, 1/2 tsp garlic, 1/2 tsp onion powder, and 1 tsp boulling powder to the liquid. I also layered the cheddar on top of the chicken. and to top it all off, I added Italian breadcrumbs(all I had) and paprika.  I also cooked covered with parchment paper and foil for 25 minutes, and then uncovered for about 10 minutes more.

This recipe was OK.  My husband would have given it more stars but the rest of the family agreed on three. I made it as is the first time and it is pretty bland.  Next time I would take the suggestions of some of the other reviews and spice it up a bit.  I think I might try it with broccoli cheese soup and add some fresh broccoli in the mix.  Also, it's very important to UNDER cook the pasta before adding it to the pan.   The additional cook time in the oven continues to cook the pasta and even though I started with al dente pasta ours was way over done.

I used chicken stock instead of the water and bouillon and boiled my spaghetti in it. I also added chopped roasted red peppers and more seasoning to my chicken mix

I made this for my family and we all enjoyed it, even my picky eater.  I used 1 cup of half and half and 1 1/4 cups of milk instead of the water and it made the sauce thicker.  I also added some parmesan cheese, a pinch of garlic powder and a pinch of onion powder and I used 1 can of cream of chicken soup and 1 can of cream of mushroom soup.  I will be making it again.

Excellent recipe. I did modify a bit...cooked boneless, skinless chicken breasts in olive oil whole (keeps it moist if you cook them whole) with a few light seasonings. Then cut them in strips before placing them on cooked noodles. For the soup mixture, I used 2 cans of cream of chicken soup, chicken broth, butter, & 1/2 cup of sour cream. After pouring over the pasta & chicken mixture, I sprinkled a little more seasoning and basil, added the cheese and cooked on 400 for about 15 minutes. My family loved it!!

Super yummy and creamy- I will say that I gave it a 5star even though I doctored it up with my favorite seasonings- thyme, rosemary, oregano, fresh crushed garlic, poultry seasoning and fresh black pepper, I used one bullion cube because I dont care for so much salt and I added a bag of frozen peas and carrots for some color and nutritional value. I used fettuccine because that's what I had.  Otherwise I followed it exactly! This is a great base recipe and my whole family gobbled it up- so creamy and delicious!  Thanks

A great base recipe.  What didn't I add to the sauce!  I added:  milk, crushed garlic, pesto, white cooking wine, crushed red pepper, sour cream, mustard, pepper, old cheddar cheese, fresh cut mushrooms, green onions, red pepper and tomato.  I skipped the butter and cooked the chicken cut into pieces in sauce and let it simmer on low heat for at least 30 mins. Once sauce and ingredients were spread evenly over spagetti I lightly dusted corn starch over it to thicken sauce then covered with old cheddar and feta cheese.  I baked until a few areas of cheese golden brown.

This was a success!  The only changes I made was to sautee up some mushrooms, onion, and garlic.  I put that on top of the chicken, before pouring the sauce over it.  It might could use some herbs added or maybe I should have just used extra sharp cheddar cheese.  I used a milder Swedish cheese, so maybe I just needed a stronger cheese.  Anyways, it was good!

I was looking for a recipe for something that I had everything on hand to make. Was I surprised to find this one! The only thing different I did was to add a package of frozen broccoli as I was sauting the veggies. I did as others suggested and added onion, bell pepper and celery. Opps! I also instead of water used a can chicken stock and a cup of water. For the cheese I used a mixture of Colby and Jack. Guess I changed it more than I thought! HA! Anyway........It was GREAT! A keeper in our home! Thanks!

Really good. Instead of the water and bouillon, used 1cup chicken broth. Use garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper on shredded chicken. I cut recipe in half & served in an 8 X 8 glass dish.
Served with salad and garlic bread.

I have always loved tetrazzini, but lost my recipe.  Tonight I made this and it will now be one of our favorites.  Since there are only two of us I cut the recipe in half.  I put in mushrooms and about 1/2 cup sour cream.  I got RAVE reviews from my husband, and my tummy thought it was pretty good also.

Tried the recipe and it reminded me of an old favorite.  So I added green chilies and topped it off with corn chips for a southwestern flavor.

I happen to love chicken tetrazzini  -  and, guess what - it is on the bland side! When you add all the "extras" in to "spice" it up, you no longer have "ckicken tetrazzini"!

I agree on this being a great base recipe, but sherry is what gives tetrazzini it's distinctive flavor.

Awesome recipe, as many suggested, I swapped cream of mushroom for one of the soups, went heavy on the cheese (enough to fully cover the dish) and tossed the cubed chicken with a mix of lemon pepper, onion powder and garlic powder. One last change was swapping chicken broth for the water and bullion cubes, again great recipe

I made this recipe tonight with a couple of modifications because we are vegetarian!  For starters, I made my own cream of no-chicken soup with 1 cup half no-chicken broth, 1 cup milk, 8 tablespoons butter, 6 tablespoons flour and salt/pepper.  I used a large loaf of velveeta cheese instead of shredded cheese.  Instead of water, I used more no-chicken broth.  I used Quorn Chick'n instead of real chicken breasts.  I used to make this before we became vegetarians and it tastes the same!

We really enjoyed this the second time around. It was very bland the first time we cooked it as listed (3 stars) so for my 2nd attempt I made the following changes per various reviews (5 stars): I cooked the spaghetti noodles in chicken broth. I used chicken broth instead of bouillon/water in the mixture. I put the cheddar cheese in the mixture, not on top. I added sauteed onions, sauteed garlic, salt and pepper to the mixture. I mixed the noodles and mixture together and poured it in the dish and topped with just breadcrumbs. Not very healthy but definitely delicious comfort food!

Not a bad base recipe but definitely needs some tweaking!  After reading other reviews, I boiled the chicken in water seasoned w/salt, pepper, onion and garlic powder, then boiled the pasta in the same water, then used some of that water in the recipe.  I added sauteed onions and quartered mushrooms, and more salt/pepper/onion/garlic powder when mixing up the sauce.  And, c'mon folks...only 1/4 cup of cheese??  How bout 3 or 4 cups!!  ;)

Really good ....with some changes.  Used leftover roaster chicken, used chicken broth instead of water and bouillon.  Sauteed sliced mushrooms, onion and carrot in olive oil before adding soups etc...used cream of chicken and cream of mushroom, added some thawed frozen peas...AND...added a big splash (1/4-1/2 c.) of sherry (!) for a flavor boost...

Pretty good for how easy it was, but the canned soup made it seem a little artificial. Not as good as homemade from scratch, but not bad either.

Exactly what I needed to use our leftover turkey.  I sauted some onions and garlic in the sauce pan before I added the ingredients to add some flavor.  I did use one can of cream of mushroom and one can of cream of chicken.  I also used parmesan inside and layered cheddar on the top.  It was delicious!  Thanks for posting.

This recipe is so good! I made it for seven people and it was great! However, I had a lot of leftovers, so one recipe would easily feed about 10. My family unanimously decided that it would be better to mix it together rather than layering it. It's definitely a keeper!

Followed the directions down to the last letter! (I had to let the dish sit in the oven a little longer due to altitude) I also had to add in a lot more spices and it still tasted a *little* bland. Other then that it turned out great and DH loved it!

Pretty good family dish.  My two picky daughters ate it, so it must be pretty good.  I only used 3 chicken breasts, and it was the right amount.  Also added garlic and a cup of shredded cheddar to the soup mixture to add flavor (in addition to the cheese I sprinkled on top before baking).

This was awesome!!!  Really had great flavor and my whole family absolutely loved it!!  I used cream of mushroom instead and added onion salt and garlic powder to the sauce and garlic salt on top of the noodles and chicken before pouring on the sauce.

I needed something easy and fast to make with some chicken breasts I had defrosted.  This was pretty good. I would make it again but I would boil and shred my chicken and I would add a little sour cream, cream cheese or half and half to the sauce as it was a little too dry, and I only cooked this 15 minutes.  I did season my chicken quite a bit and added some onion and some mushrooms.  Next time I would probably add some vegetables also.  Thanks!

What's better than cheddar? BACON. This flavor profile was kicked up a notch with a few strips of bacon and  the addition of 1/4C of sour cream, 1/4C cream cheese, 1can of soup, only 2C of water and this came out rich and creamy and flavorful. I spiced it up with garlic, onions, emerils seasoning, italian seasoning, red pepper flake and a splash of soy and worcestershire.

Great recipe! I actually doubled the recipe and had enough to make two very large casseroles and one medium casserole. I was able to bless a family that just had a baby, keep one for us, and send one to my sister too! I followed other reviewers suggestions and used 1 can of cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of mushroom soup. I also followed advice and cooked the pasta in broth for more flavor, yummy! I also added sliced mushrooms to my casserole under the cheese and that made a perfect recipe even better! I will be making this again, probably really soon for two friends having babies. This is something they can freeze and bake at their leisure for ease. Thanks for sharing!

I did as others recommended 1 can cream of mushroom and 1 can cream of chicken, instead of the boulion cubes/water, I just used chicken broth. I added a couple of tablespoons of sour cream and only did three chicken breast b/c the ones I bought were pretty big. I also threw in some frozen peas/carrots. It turned out great.  I will be making this again.

I halved the recipe because I cook for two. Then I added a can of mixed veggies just to add a little flavor, color, and to make it go a bit further. If you plan on doing this I would add two cans for a full recipe. It was a good and cheap dinner.

I made a few minor changes, used 1 can of cream of mushroom, 1 can of cream of chicken.  Instead of using water and bouillon cubes, I used 2 cups (1 can) of chicken broth + 1/4 cup water.  Instead of cheddar cheese on top, I mixed some bread crumbs with parmesan cheese to sprinkle on top.  Good and easy, will definitely make this again.

This was very good!!  The family loved it.  I did add some fresh mushrooms in with the onions while sauteing.  Added a little more cheese - can't have tooo much cheese - will keep in the monthly rotation!

3 out of 4 of us liked this a lot.  Only change I made was using 4 chicken breasts instead of 5 and adding some seasoning.  I gave it 4 stars because it didn't wow the whole family but otherwise a good dish.  I'd make it again.

This was pretty good and super easy. Made it last night with cut up leftover roast chicken.  As is the recipe did look a bit lacking in seasoning, I tweaked a bit.  Used chicken stock instead of the water/boullion.  Added garlic and onion powder and some parsley to the bubbling sauce mixture. Tossed the cut up chicken with salt, pepper, paprika and italian herbs.  Mixed it all together with the spaghetti.  Added a few tablespoons of buttered bread crumbs to the cheese for the topping.  Super easy and very yummy. I'm sure adding mushrooms or other sauteed veggies would work really well too. Definitely stick to your ribs comfort food.

After seeing a previous rating in which seasoning were added, and not seeing any  in the recipe itself, I too decided to add some spice. I added approx. 1 tsp garlic power, onion power, paprika, basil and 2 tbsp of parsley. The results were AMAZING. This is the best tetrazzini I have ever tasted, much less cooked. Everyone loved it. This dish would be a hit no matter what the occasion.

This was really tasty!  We all really liked it. I followed the directions exactly. When I cooked my chicken I sauted it seasoned with lemon pepper and a little garlic powder (after it soaked in buttermilk a bit).  If you use unseasoned chicken I can see where the dish could be bland. But this was enjoyable...a great comfort food dish!

Made this for dinner and it was compared to alfredo sauce. I sprinkled onion powder, garlic powder, and pepper on the chicken and seared it in a hot frying pan with a little olive oil. Cooked until browned on both sides but slightly pink in the center.It gets cooked again in the oven so I didn't want the chicken to become tough. Then I cubed the chicken and followed the rest exactly as described. Everyone loved it.But it would have been way too bland had I not cooked the chicken the way I had first. The chicken was delicious and very tender.

Sooo good if you spice it up a bit!! I added to the soup mixture: Lawreys perfect blend for chicken & poultry, garlic powder, cayanne pepper, a generous amount of plack pepper, and green onions. Once hot taste it a few times adding a bit of spices here and there until you have a flavorful taste you like.  I used ROTISSERIE chicken which really adds a nice flavor. I also added brocoli to the top of the chicken.  I mixed pepper jack cheese with cheddar and then added equal amounts of italian bread crumbs. My husband the notorious casserole hater even loved it!

I made this for dinner for a few girlfriends.  It was really easy to make, I added some chopped broccoli to add some flavor.  It was a little bland, but I would definitely make it again, but add some more spices.

Fabulous!  I substituted a can of tuna for the chicken, and even that turned out great!  Next time I will add some shredded/chopped veggies (carrots or broccoli, maybe) for a little color and to lighten up the taste a bit.

This was very good.  I was worried about the salt (from the other reviews) so I put in just one boullion cube....two probably would've been a little better.  I also reduced the water by 1/4 cup and added 1/3 cup Marsala wine (didn't have any sherry).  Lastly, I added a butter/plain bread crumb topping.  My 4-year old and 5 year-old practically licked their bowls clean!!

This recipe is wonderful!  Another nice thing is that everything was already here and I didn't have to go to the grocery store.  Husband LOVED it.  I reheated the leftovers in the oven instead of the microwave and they were just as good, if not better, than before.

I used fettucini noodles; added tomato chunks, onions, some seasoning and tomato basil feta cheese mixed in with the shredded cheese on top. Came out a little salty. I might try to add some milk next time to make it a little creamier? Maybe some pees and corn?

Simple but I added a some fresh veggies for color:  1 c. fresh spinach leaves (sliced into 1/2" strips) into cooked noodles. Plus saute'ed 1 diced onion, 1/2 diced red pepper, 2 cloves minced garlic, 6 oz sliced fresh mushrooms in butter+olive oil which gave it nice color & added flavor/nutrition. However, the sauce was thin and didn't set up like a typical tetrazzini {I might thicken it with flour if I make this again}. I also topped it with shredded parmesan and breadcrumbs before baking. Tasty but fell apart when spooned onto plate.

I used chicken broth instead of the water; organic condensed cream of mushroom soup instead of the cream of chicken soup and I added a couple of tablespoons of organic powdered chicken boullion (along with a bit of sage and thyme, since I used mushroom soup, instead of chicken).  Next time, I will add a couple of cloves of garlic, too.  Oh, and 1/4 cup of cheddar cheese was not nearly enough to cover a 9" x 13" dish -- I doubled that.  I agree that spaghetti, as another reviewer mentioned, is not the best choice for holding the sauce, but Tetrazzini is supposed to be spaghetti, so you'd have to change the name, I would think, if you used a different pasta.

This was delicious.  I used 5 chicken strips instead of breasts because I don't like too much meat. I used more cheese than described.  It was great!

Very tasty. I raised some chickens last spring and they've been taking up space in my freezer ever since, so, I thawed one out and cut it up and cooked it for this recipe. As someone mentioned, I subbed one can of cream of mushroom soup for one of the 2 cans of cream of chicken soup. I also put some spices on the chicken when it was roasting, and sprinkled some grated mizithra cheese over the cheddar. Other than that I stuck with the recipe. It came out great.

So easy to make and an excellent way to use up some old chicken. I simply cut up a leftover rotisserie chicken, and I pretty much followed the recipe to a "T". The only differences I made was I added broccoli and used bow tie pasta instead of spaghetti. My 6 year old absolutely loved it!

It turned out good. I substituted macaroni for the pasta, and added mushrooms, yellow onion, green onion, and tomatoes. The next time, I will season the mix before I pout it in the baking pan and use more cheese.

Ultimate comfort food! I rated it a four because I changed it to make it a five, and it was still easy! I made it with flat, fat thick noodles instead of spaghetti. (I think the Amish made them.) Added garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, italian seasoning, and lemon pepper which was recommended. Then instead of water, bullion cubes and butter, I added 2.5 cups of chicken stock (this is where the flavor is!) that was previously made from scratch and frozen. Also, I only put in about three chicken breasts worth of meat. I substituted in some stir fry veggies with broccoli, carrots, peppers, etc. I also added sliced mushrooms and added ground up cracker crumbs on the top of the cheese. Since this casserole was so juicy, I did not bother to cover it up in the oven. I just kept my eye on the cheese to make sure it did not get too brown. My family went back for seconds. Yummy!

Great dish!very versatile & easy to change to suit your family tastes.
This is a dish I make frequently - but I use egg noodles, I saute the garlic and some onion in a large fry pan, brown the chicken in strips, mix the soup w/milk and parsley flakes & pour over the chicken while it's cooking. Then I layer the noodles, chicken, sauce & parmesan - about 2-3 layers with chicken on top, and sprinkle with parmesan, then in the oven at 350 for 1/2 hr. you need LOTS of 'sauce' because the noodles really soak it up. I pretty much use at least 3 cans of soup thinned with milk to make the sauce!  It's a winner served with garlic bread!

As the recipe stands it is pretty bland, however, it really really hit the spot for being sick and needing comfort food without having to put in much effort.  I spiced up the chicken a bit while cooking it - that helped.  Really this gets as good as you want to experiment with it.  Nice stand by.

Very easy and good! Good without changes, but for more flavor, I added some onions & garlic I had sautéed in butter. I also used chicken broth in place of the bouillon cubes/water. A store bought rotisserie chicken made it even easier. I just mixed everything together, including the cheese, put in the greased dish and then sprinkled more cheddar and some parmesan on top. Family loved it!!!

Family loved it.  I used linguini just for something different.  I also put a can of sweet peas and a lot more cheese.  We love cheese.  It's a great base that you can alter to what you like.

When making this – I froze half (only two of us). Frozen half only had the soup/chicken topping on angel hair (on hand). When thawing – warming portions in microwave –then topped with sharp cheddar (whatever on hand cheese, mozzarella, Colby) microwaved another 15 seconds – made great freeze eat later recipe.

I made this tonight and it was great, of course after reading the posts I modified it a lot. I added peas and carrots and parmeasan cheese and a healthy layer of sharp cheddar. In addition I roasted the chicken breasts ( but the awesome thing if you oven roast your chicken breasts you can cook as much as you like and just freeze what's leftover for another dish), but with the modifications this was awesome.. Thanks for sharing...

We enjoyed this a great deal, made exactly as the recipe is written. My husband and 6-year-old were both happy -- him because he got a filling, hot, good-tasting meal, her because she got both "chickie" and spaghetti. It's a winner!

Didn't try, but think I will try in case of no time to make my normal tetrazzini recipe that uses heavy cream. To the lady who said her boys didn't like the cheddar, I think the more traditional recipe (like the one I have) calls for parmesan cheese.  I would also use either 2 cans of cream of mushroom or 1 of mush. and 1 of chicken and add pepper.

Pretty much followed the original recipe, only thing I really changed was doing one can cream of mushroom soup, one can cream of chicken soup, omitted the butter/margarine all together, and baked the chicken with salt and pepper before assembling the dish. It was creamy and delish! Next time, I'll put some cheese in the middle of the dish as well as on top and add some fresh mushrooms. That would have taken it over the top!!!

Big disappointment ever!  This was by far the worst recipe that I have ever tried. I follow the recipe to the "T"  and it was still very soupy with little flavor other than the high salt content.  So irritated that I wasted my time and my family's expectation this mess!
Ewwww (mad face)!

This is a great basic recipe that's adjustable for personal preferences. I'll make it again with a few adjustments. I agree with other reviewers that it would very bland without extra spices. I cut the recipe in half and made in an 8x8 pan - plenty for two people. With two chicken breasts and half a package of spaghetti, I had the right amount. I cooked the chicken in a pan with onion salt, garlic powder and pepper. Next time I'll boil the chicken and omit salt - it's too much with the bullion. I also used straight chicken broth as others suggested. To the soup mixture I added a generous helping of Italian seasoning and dried chopped onion - it helped a ton! Topped it off with mozzarella cheese that I had on hand (cheddar is probably better), paprika, and Italian breadcrumbs. This would also be good with some veggies thrown in.

I made a half-recipe with chicken pulled from a roaster last night.  Used more than 2 tbsp shredded cheese (I'm sure!) and angel hair pasta, just slightly undercooked.  Added a small can of drained mushrooms and a small amt of black pepper. Only cooked it for 20 minutes and broiled the cheese on top for a few minutes.

It turned out great!  We'll probably have at last 1.5 meals' worth left over.

MMM! Great for an easy night with sweet dinner rolls and a veggie. Added some shakes of red pepper flake, italian seasoning and curry (think chicken divan). Did 1/2 cream of mush and 1/2 cream of chicken. Added 1/2 pound of mushrooms. This cost us $6 to make so it's also economical. Thanks!

As suggested by others i traded the water and bouillon cubes for low sodium chicken broth. I used one can of cream of mushroom and chicken. I added some  garlic, pepper, and a lemon rosemary mix to the chicken. I also added some cooked broccoli as well. It turned out great, and the leftovers heat up nicely the next day.

A great comfort food!  Like some others have suggested,  I boiled the chicken breasts in chicken broth and then used the broth to boil the spaghetti.  Great flavor!  I also just used 1 can of cream of chicken soup and 1 cream of broccoli.  I also added some frozen broccoli to get in some veggies. Very good.

Hi! This is my very first recipe on allrecipes, so I wanted something very basic. However, I tried some changes. I used 1 pound of whole wheat penne pasta instead of spaghetti because I wanted to go healthy and get whole wheat pasta, but I couldn't find whole wheat spaghetti that was 16 oz, it was all like 14.5 oz.! Also, I bought the Tyson cooked and cubed chicken in a bag. I used Campbell's Heathy Request soups. I added a can of mushrooms. I only used 3 tablespoons of butter instead of 4, and I used about 1/2 cup of shredded cheese. And. . .it was pretty good. But I learned that spaghetti or angel hair IS probably better because with the penne, the sauce didn't really stay on top of the pasta - it just as mixed together like a casserole. The already prepared chicken was good, and the sauce was good - Maybe just a little bit bland, like it needed an extra Tablespoon of butter and soup with more sodium! :)  If I make it again, I will probably add some frozen vegetables in addition to the mushrooms. I also would leave off the cheese on top because I couldn't really taste it. Oh,and I tried to add Italian breadcrumbs on half as you may see in the picture, but I wouldn't do that again. It was too dry although maybe I'll crumble some cheezits on top!! Now that could be good! The leftovers were better the next day, so I think that it's good to let it settle and soak in the flavors. But next time I'll try to follow the recipe more closely- just add more stuff!!

Really good stuff! I just added my own flare (as far as spices go) and it turned out nicely.  Also, I added a lot less water but my proportions were just a tad smaller.  Overall great stuff!

Really tasty and amazingly easy meal. I was surprised at how thick the sauce got with just the few ingredients listed-very great to have for a weeknight meal that doesn't taste as simple as it is.

Really good base recipe with loads of options for changes. I cooked linguine in the broth instead of water, but found that the pasta absorbed all the water very quickly so I was a bit worried the pasta would burn or not cook, but it seemed to go ok. Then added another 1.5 cups of broth instead of the water and bouillon in stage 2. Also added 1/2 chopped onion that I had left over and a handful of frozen peas. I should have cooked the onions first I think but it still tasted great. Be careful when nuking leftovers the following day - I managed to burn the back of my throat as it was so hot - unfortunately it now feels like I have a cold coming on as the throat is sore :-(

We loooved this recipe, but made a few alterations. I sauteed the chicken in lemon juice, garlic powder, paprika, oregano, parsley and some salt and pepper like some other people suggested. Also I added a 1/4 of sour cream to the sauce, it just makes it creamier. Super good :) Also I minced some frozen broccoli and sprinkled it over the sauce. Great recipe!!!

This is a favorite of both of my kids whom are pretty picky eaters.  I don,t use as much chicken as in the recipe though... I usually roast 2 whole chickens and we eat a little bit more than 1 chicken for one meal, and the remainder goes in this dish for another night.  We also use, as per recommended by other reviewers, 1 can of condensed mushroom soup and another of cream of chicken.  Tried both low sodium and low fat varieties and it works.

This was a really good dish and makes a full 9x13 pan!  I sauteed the chicken with salt, pepper, onion and garlic, used two cream of chicken soups and chicken broth in place of the H20 and boullion.  I also added a bag of frozen peas.  I wanted to add bread crumbs to the top over the cheese like others had posted, but didn't have any so I used french fried onions left over in the pantry from Thanksgiving.  It was awesome!  The whole family loved the meal completed with a nice green salad and french bread.  It is definately a keeper!

This is a great recipe!  I used whole grain thin spaghetti, 98% fat free cream of chicken soup, and 2% cheddar (I added the cheese at just the end of the baking time).  Will make again!

I made this following other's advice of 1 can cream of chicken and 1 of cream of mushroom. I used 2 cans of canned chicken instead of the 5 chicken breasts called for and it tasted great! I also put the cheese directly on top of the chicken before I poured the sauce over it. The cheese melted wonderfully (though I think I could have used more). And for sure press down the Italian breadcrumbs or they don't cook and taste vvveerrrryyy dry. For sure a recipe I'll use again!

This is a really quick, versital recipe that needs a little doctorin', but it's great!  We did a heavier noodle. Added garlic powder, onion powder, garlic salt, red pepper flake and used chicken broth, plus we had no cheddar, so we added mozzarella, swiss and some cream cheese!  I loved the fact the could pull it together with stuff we had handy.  Yummy, thanks.

This recipe was wonderful but I did change it up a bit just to make it easier on myself since I'm working and have a baby.  I cooked the chicken in the crockpot for 10 hours along with the liquids mentioned in the recipe.  I used chicken broth instead of the bouillon.  I also added some seasonings to the soup mixture that I would usually add to chicken (montreal seasoning and garlic powder).   I shredded the chicken up after it was done cooking, added a head of broccoli florets and added everything in one big bowl and stirred it up (even with the broccoli and all of the juice from the chicken/soup mixture and cooked noodles).  I poured it in a 13X9 pan and topped with the shredded cheddar and used about 1 cup of panko breadcrumbs on top and then baked.  It was tremendous!  You've got to try this tasty recipe!

This was delicious and very easy to make.  I did take some other reviewers suggestions though.  I used cream of mushroom soup because I didn't have cream of chicken.  Added half a medium onion and a little garlic.  I also used chicken broth and sherry versus the water and bouillon.  I used a Mexican cheese blend instead cheddar because that's all I had, and mixed that in with the chicken, pasta and sauce.  I used some Italian bread crumbs for the topping to bake.  This is really great with a side salad.

this was a good recipe and my husband loved it! I used canned chicken and, like some others have said, used 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can cream of mushroom. I changed it a littled and topped with bread crumbs, which made a yummy crust. We will make this again! (and it was better the next day!)

GREAT recipe! I love chicken tetrazzini but had never cooked it myself. I substituted chicken broth in place of the recommended water, but I think next time I will put all of the broth in to make it a little more saucier.  I also switched one of the cans of CoC for CoMushroom.  My family has not befriended celery, so I chopped some summer squash and sauteed it in the butter before adding the CoC and CoM.  I have a very picky family and this went over very well! Thanks for the great recipe!

Very Good.  I used 1 can cream of mushroom and 1 can cream of celery (no cream of chicken in the pantry), seasoned whole chicken cut up, and chicken broth in place of the water and lots of cheese. Thanks,

Boy this dish made a lot of food, but unfortunately it was not a hit with my family.  We've never had chicken tetrazzini so wanted to try something new.  Looks like were more of a marinara sauce kind of family.  We found this to be bland, and ended up with a lot of wasted left over food.

This was fabulous. Who doesn't have most if not all the ingredients and its so adaptable to whatever you might have on hand. I added a handful of frozen peas and mixed vegetables for variety and color. Hubby hoped there was leftovers, and the teenager asked for more.

I wanted to give this three stars, but in all fairness, I deviated from the recipe which may have caused the lower rating. I believe this could be a four-star recipe with the right changes. I don't think it will ever become a 5-star, but I'll keep trying.

2 Huge Thumbs Up for this crowd pleaser! Variations to recipe:linguine noodles, added carrots, & jack/cheddar cheese.  Don't forget to flatten down the cheese so it doesn't get crispy.  It is EASY...10 min prep, 25 min bake time..

This recipe was very good.  I used 2 boneless skinless chicken breasts cut into very, very small pieces and seasoned with garlic powder, roasted minced garlic, Lawry’s seasoning salt, and a pasta seasoning blend. (Next time I will use 3 chicken breasts.) I sautéed the chicken in olive oil with a 4 oz jar of diced pimientos, diced green bell pepper, and diced red onion.  Then, I mixed the chicken mixture with the cooked spaghetti, 2 cans of cream of chicken soup, and some chicken stock, mixed it all together in a large bowl, and then transferred it into a baking dish. (It was the perfect amount to fill two 8x8 dishes.) After topping with a cheddar/monterey jack cheese mixture, I covered it with tin foil and baked for 45 minutes.  In my opinion it’s very important to cover with tin foil, or else the top/edges will get crispy.  I served it with a basic green salad and garlic bread.  I wouldn’t say that this dish was out of this world, I won’t get cravings for it or anything….but it was definitely good.  The whole family liked it, including my 2 year old niece who can be picky.  I will probably make it again. Thanks!

This recipe was my first try at tetrazzini.  It came out ok the first time. It lacked taste.  The next time i made it i added garlic powder, onion powder, and parsley.  On the last few minutes i added breadcrumbs to the top to give it a bit of crunch.    It's something your kids and husband will eat.

This was pretty good. I took other reviewers advice and "doctored it up" a little bit. I chopped my chicken up before boiling, then I boiled my chicken in water with a few chicken bouillon cubes, garlic powder, a little bit of minced garlic (that comes in the jar), onion powder, chicken seasoning, italian seasoning, lemon pepper, and regular pepper. Then I strained it from the water. I also boiled my spaghetti noodles in water with chicken bouillon cubes for extra flavor and right before I put a lil salt into the water for flavor.  While the noodles were boiling I took a can of carrots and diced them up. Then I strained the noodles and lay them in the casserole dish 9x13. Then I took a can of cream of chicken and a can of cream of mushroom and some milk and heated it on the stove. As it almost began to boil I added the can of carrots that I'd diced and a can of peas (I drained the juice off first). Note-I thought I had regular peas, but after I'd opened and poured that I'd gotten the ones with the mushrooms and small pearl onions. But it was ok I think it added to the flavor of the dish as  a whole. Then I added a little shredded cheddar, a lil shreeded mozarella, and a lil shredded parmesean cheese to the sauce mix.  Then while that was going I chopped up the chicken a little bit more so there wouldnt be huge chunks in my casserole, and spread the chicken across the noodles. Then I poured the sauce over it all and spread it out evenly ad topped it all off with shredded chedd

Wow this was yummy!  I cooked the chicken on my little george foreman in the kitchen and used the juice to throw in with the spaghetti when I boiled that.  Then I substituted chicken broth for the water/bouillon (although that would be handy if one was caught without broth at the last minute).  Sprinkled some Cajun Seasoning on it on my plate and deeeeelicious.  Will be making this again!

Exactly what I was looking for!  I did what another user suggested and used a can of evaporated milk in place of the water.  I also boiled the spaghetti in chicken broth and used one can cream of mushroom and one can cream of chicken.  My husband had a second helping and that's always a good sign!!

This recipe was so easy and the family really liked it.  Simple basic ingredients make it a snap to fix any time.  I like to change out the water for evaporated milk to make it even richer.  Yum!  This is a keeper!

I just made this recipe and I really like it. I took some tips and added the cheese to the sauce then sprinkled this with bread crumbs. The lemon and spices (garlic and pepper) I used to toss the chicken with really went along way to adding the necessary Zing to this dish. Next time though I will omit the bread crumbs and thicken the sauce a bit . There was the correct amount of sauce but I found it sort of soupy. This is a great recipe for leftover pasta with items I always have on hand. I will definitely be making this tasty dish again and again. Thanks!

I love this recipe! It's quick and easy. I did add a few spices to the original recipe to make it more flavorful, per other reviewer's suggestions. Turned out great! And now I know what to do with all the leftover Christmas turkey! :)

I was short on time this year, so made my usual Turkey Tet with this recipe. My family was disappointed because it was not as rich as it usually turns out. Alas, all of it (including leftovers) were devoured, but the consensus was to return to the cream based recipe.

I read some of the reviews before making this dish and they were helpful.  I also tried to make it a half recipe as I read that it would be quite large.  I used a 12 oz. bag of egg noddles, 2 cut up chicken breasts seasoned with onion, garlic, parsley, basil and oregano, 1 can of cream of chicken, 1 1/2 C. of chicken broth, 1 large Tbsp of butter and I put in a quarter cup of shredded Mexican blend cheese in the sauce while still hot.  I added the same seasonings to the sauce mix before boiling as well. I also mixed about a quarter cup of breadcrumbs with another quarter cup of the same cheese (I like cheese!) that made a crunchy top.

This will make an appearance on our menu from now on! Thank you for all the helpful hints! Next time I am thinking of adding the peas or broccoli some of you mentioned!

I wasn't hog-wild over this one... but it was good and easy.  I will try more variation in the future, like putting veggies in.  
It makes so much!!!  I will definitely be dividing it next time.  We ate leftovers for a week and, unfortunately, still had to pitch a bunch.

For how simple this is it's very good.  I couldn't stop eating it!  Very tasty and very easy.  I used one can cream of mushroom and one can cream of chicken like others suggested.  Also added some roasted red bell pepper, lemon pepper and tomatoes since I had some in the fridge.  A very easy recipe to modify.

This was a very good recipe. I cut it in half, since I was using left over rotisserie chicken. This worked out perfect. I added a few seasonings, McCormick's Montreal Chicken seasoning, papkika, and a little minced onion and minced garlic. Then right before pouring the mixture on the noodles I added about 1 cup frozen veggies. A great way to used left over chicken. Will make again!

Very good, my husband and I both liked it very much. I was afraid there would be too much water so I reduced it just a bit, but I think the 2 1/4 cups would work too. I will definitely make it again.

this was a real hit! the only differnent things i really did to this receipe was throw a little garlic poweder and used a shreded 3 Cheese Italian blend of white cheeses on the top. tasted great and gave the whole thing a nice clean white sauce look. It really was a hit with my Boyfriends family. his little brother went back 3 times and ended up licking his plate clean!  only suggestion is dont be afraid to go off with the cheese! :)

This was a super good recipe, however I did alter a quite a bit and made it even better! I put the chicken I sauted, sauted mushrooms, and about a cup of cheddar cheese in between two layers of the spaghetti, reduced the water by 1 cup in the soup mixture and poured over the top. Then made a crust out of crumbled butter crackers mixed with butter and fat free sour cream. Baked for about 35 minutes and we loved it!!

Did as others recommended and used cream of chicken soup and cream of mushroom, added can of peas and jar of mushrooms, used water & bouillon as recipe does, used only about 2 tbsp of butter.  Seasoned chicken with garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper and paprika before cooking.  Mixed everything together and topped with  shredded italian cheese blend, grated parmesan, and bread crumbs.  Very filling!

To keep pots and pans to a minimum, I first boiled my chicken breasts with a bit of chicken base added to water.  I reserved about 2 cups of the chicken broth to use later, added more water and boiled the spaghetti in the same pot of water. After draining the pasta, I prepared the sauce in that same pot.  I only needed half the recipe so I used 1 can cream of mushroom soup, my reserved chicken broth and about 1/2 cup sour lite sour cream.  I think the sour cream adds more flavor and helps make it creamier. Also, boiling the spaghetti in a broth adds more flavor. I felt like this called for a cracker crumb topping so I added that and used parmesan cheese and Italiam cheese blend for the topping. YUM!  Everyone enjoyed this.

Thank you, Marian Collins!  My husband now wants to have a dinner party just so we can serve this dish.:)  I have prepared this recipe twice as written, and it was delicious both times; I also made it once substituting canned broth for the buillion and water.

This was delicious and easy!  I cut the recipe in half and used broth instead of water for added flavor. I sauted onion in the butter with a little garlic and used cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken soup.  If I were to make more servings, I would use both soups as previously recommended.  Because I love vegetables, I used broccoli and layer that on top of the chicken.  Will definitely make again and again!

Great recipe. Have made it twice, and second time was even better because I inadvertantly used milk instead of water...yuuumm! Was so rich! Also doused with fresh ground pepper. Perfect!

I made this recipe tonight and it was YUMMY!  I did it a little differently and it worked out perfect! My family ate it up!
I did the 1 lb. thin spaghetti, 1 large can of cream of chicken soup, one can of 1% milk (filled the empty can), one traditional flavored rotisserie chicken cut up, 3 oz of velveeta melted into the soup mixture, tsp garlic powder, tsp onion powder, tsp of black pepper and the two chicken bouillion cubes.  I cooked the spaghetti, and I creamed the sauce together then added the cut up chicken and mixed together then topped with one 8 oz package of SHARP cheddar.  It took maybe 15 minutes to put together and since it was already hot when I put it in the oven it only took 5 minutes to melt and the cheese.
With a loaf of toasty French bread this was the best dinner in a long time! Yummy comfort food at it's best!

Everyone in my family liked this, even the toddlers. I too used cream of chicken and mushroom and added some celery and onions. I also used milk instead of water.

This one is always a favorite and makes a TON of food! I don't usually have the patience to cook the chicken breast myself so I just buy a rotisserie (sp?) chicken, take the skin off, and use all the meat.  Adds extra flavor and saves time.

This was very good. Of course I change it a little after reading some of the reviews and glad that i did. I use 1 can of cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of mushrooms. I also added a can of mushrooms and added some onions. I use a cup of chicken broth and only 3/4 cup of water and followed the recipe. Oh, I also mixed my cooked pasta in my soup mixture , then poured everyhting in a baking dish.

Tried this recipe and thought it came out very well. I had to use what I had on hand, so I substituted 1 of the cans of cream of chicken soup for a can of Ms. Penny's white sauce.  Sauted celery with butter then added the rest of the ingrediants.  Instead of water used a can of chicken broth and about 3/4 of a cup of white wine (didn't need the bouillion - so I left it out).  It turned out great but wish I'd put some fresh mushrooms in it and had used Sherry.  That to me would have made it 5 stars. The recipe is so versatile and everyone's comments helped me realize the versatility of the recipe and they were right.  Thank you!

This tasted really great! My husband thought it was gourmet--little did he know how easy it was! I made a couple of suggested changes--I used 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and 1 can of cream of chicken soup. I used chicken broth instead of boullion and water and I only put a tablespoon of butter in. (I had some leftover chicken broth and added that to the water I cooked the spaghetti in.) Also, I bought a 10 oz. can of chunk chicken and used that instead of chicken breasts. That seemed like plenty of chicken to me. This does make LOTS, so if you only need to feed 3-4, you could probably halve it if you don't want too many leftovers.

I thought this recipe was very good. Along with many others, I made several changes to the recipe. I used one can cream of chicken and one can cream of mushroom, like many others. I also added about 1 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp seasoned salt, and a few shakes of salt and pepper to the soup mixture...I used about 3/4 cup chicken broth instead of water (the recipe calls for way too much water). I also used extra wide egg noodles instead of spaghetti, and I used leftover chicken broth to cook the noodles (which made them very tender and savory). I added a 6 oz jar of sliced mushrooms and a 10 oz. box of frozen peas. Basically I threw together the noodles, soup mixture, peas, chicken, and mushrooms into one big pot, stirred it all up, and THEN put it into the dish. I then covered that with about 1.5 cups sharp cheddar cheese mixed w/ 1/2 cup shredded monterey jack cheese. I cooked all that for 10 minutes at 350, then removed it and sprinkled a sleeve of crushed Ritz crackers that I mixed with a bit of melted butter over it. I put it back in the oven for another 15 minutes after that, and then served it with a dollop of sour cream on the side (which REALLY brought out a lot of flavor, very good addition). I was worried it would be a little bland but it was very tasty. I think I would've used less noodles, though, I put in 16 oz and that was way too much, I ended up throwing a bunch away, it was too much for the pan. Overall great IF you alter it and add your own seasonings etc!

I really enjoyed this.  Even my 7yr. old daughter ate it.(with the exception of the mushrooms)  I modified it a little.   The chicken was marinated in Italian dressing, seasoned with onion powder and a little garlic,  sauted some mushroom & onions with it.  I also added about a cup of sour cream to the sauce. At the last minute I thought I would add the asparagus that I intended for a side.  Everything in one dish.  I am definitely adding this to my recipe box.

I used angel hair pasta for the base and omitted the butter in the soup. I used 1 can cream of mushroom, 1 can cream of chicken, and added a 4oz can of mushroom pieces, drained. I used the remainders of a veggie tray and cut raw broccoli and cauliflower very thinly, and put it on top of the pasta. Added the chicken, then 1-1/2 cups sharp cheddar shreds, then 1/2 cup Italian bread crumbs. The veggies were a tiny bit crunchy which added some texture. It's nice if you cut the chicken pieces and the veggies into bite-sized pieces, and it's easier for the kids to eat (ages 7 & 8). Mine say to rate this recipe 5 stars!

I made this a little more cheezy by adding 4 oz velveeta to the soup mixture and more grated cheese on top.It is so delicious and easy to make. Try adding a little bit of Ranch dressing on top as a garnish. Yummy!

I accidentally used cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken...but it actually turned out pretty tasty.  I also added broccoli and garlic, and seasoned the chicken prior to making the casserole.  I'll definitely make this again!

This is exactly what I had in mind when looking for a Chicken Tetrazzini recipe.  The only changes I made were a dash of garlic in the sauce, more cheese (no such thing as too much cheese in my world) and topped with Italian bread crumbs for texture.  I scaled the recipe to 4 servings with no problem.  Basic ingredients, easy preparation and satisfying flavor.  Thanks for sharing!

This was very good. I added some onions and mushrooms to the chicken as it cooked. I also added some garlic powder in the sauce mix before I poured it over the chicken and noodles. The only difference other than that would be to mix the ingredients in a bowl first before putting it in the baking dish, because I wouldve liked to have the ingredents better mingled together. I would even mix the cheese throughout as well, and maybe throw a little more on top. But the taste was great. Thanks for the recipe.

My husband and I LOVED this meal. We're newlyweds and I'm always looking for casserole dishes that we can freeze and he can take to work the next day. Well, I never saw how good it worked as leftovers because he ate the ENTIRE pan (minus the small corner portion I had). I added about twice the cheese (he LOVES cheese) and used Sharp Cheddar, I used half the water and added some Worcestire sauce and cooking Sherry instead. Also added buttered broccoli and sprinkled with Italian bread crumbs. GREAT RECIPE!!

I made half a recipe, and it was just right for 4 people. I added some onion, and next time will add some garlic and maybe fresh mushrooms. This is a great "starter" recipe that you could dress up in so many ways. Also, I tossed grated cheddar cheese with bread crumbs so that the topping was a little crispy. Will definitely make and experiment with again.

I would have to give this 3.5 stars. It was good and certainly easy enough. I did alter the recipe quite a bit.(So it may have been better as written, but I think it would be bland w/o the additional flavors.)
 I added some leftover sauted mushrooms & steamed broccoli, used 1 can of Cream of Chicken soup and 1 can of Cream of Mushroom with Roasted Garlic soup, and used a can of Vegetable broth instead of the water and boullion. I topped it with 2-3 cups of Colby/Jack cheese because 1/4 of a cup of cheese seemed skimpy to me.

My 7 year old daughter loved this. She had 2 helpings. My husband also liked it. I on the other hand did not like. The taste seemed off. When I told my family I won't be making this again my daughter said but mommy please its so good. I decided I will make only for them and I will eat something else.

I combined this recipe with another called "Chicken Breasts with Herb Basting Sauce," also on this site and this was fabulous. I wouldn't change a thing except use that other recipe to cook your chicken breasts! Excellent!

The wife and kids loved it, for sure a keeper. I tweaked it a little, in the place of water and bouillon cubes i used broth and upped cheese to 1 cup. Next time will add salt and pepper.

Very tasty recipe.  In a few reviews, I read that it was to salty, and since I'm not a salt lover I only added 1 bouillon cube, instead of 2.  The only other thing I would change is the amount of spaghetti noodles.  Instead of 16 oz. of noodles, I would just use 8 oz.  Overall, everyone liked it!

Simply FABULOUS!!! I loved this... I have no clue what the other reviewers meant about salty!! THIS WAS JUST RIGHT!!! Better than the frozen Stouffers DH loves for lunch! This will save me so much money!!! I used the new Louis Rich precooked chicken cutlets and it worked out great. The cream of chicken soup along with the water and wylers cubes weren't too salty at all!! I used marble cheddar cheese (just a little bit!) and topped it with bread crumbs from a container and it tasted great! This is a great meal if you want something fast and comforting! Thanks so much Marian, you've made this pregnant Mama happy!!!!

I did not like this recipe.  It was too salty.  There needs to be significant changes made to this recipe in order for it to taste good. I was not impressed at all.

Real yummy!  Everyone loved the creamy flavor.  I used 1 can cream of chicken soup & 1 can cream of mushroom soup.  I also added 1 cup of milk and only 1 cup water.  Next time I think I'll add some chopped green pepper to give it a little zip!

I thought this was really good! I took the advice of other reviewers and used 1 can crm of mushroom soup and 1 can crm of chicken. I also added some spices to cook my chicken in: butter, seasoned salt, onion powder, garlic powder, and pepper. I used chicken broth instead of water and omitted the bouillon cubes. I also used spiral-shaped noodles because they’re good at holding the sauce. In the end I sprinkled seasoned breadcrumbs over the top and added way more than a 1/4 cup cheddar cheese for the topping. I will definitely be making this again - the kids and hubby really liked it too.

This is a great recipe! The only adjustment I highly recommend is using a different cheese.  My family prefers parmesan and I personally think it's  a bit more elegant.  I've used this base recipe many times and it holds up to all kinds of tweaks & substitutions.   Any "cream of" soups work: broccoli, asparagus, mushroom, even Golden Mushroom.   Have fun playing around with your own additions! :-)

this was super easy and great for a weeknight.  I halved the recipe. used chicken broth instead of water as suggested.  I added paprika, and some Tony's Cajun seasoning to zip it up a bit.  it was fabulous.

Amazing!! I followed other reviews and added sauteed mushrooms and broccoli and substituted chicken broth for water. When I cooked the chicken I added onion powder, garlic powder and pepper. Finally, in the  final 10 minutes of baking I added buttered Ritz crackers. It was delicious! My foodie husband LOVED it!

Try rotisserie chicken! Also love adding mushrooms and doing one can cream of chicken and one cream of mushroom. I use Monterey Jack instead of cheddar and put some into the soup mix as well.

This is good but I make a few changes for my taste. I use egg noodles, 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup, plus a can of mushroom pieces fried for texture, and i use milk not water. My friend gave me a recipe for this but we both lost our copy and this was the closest I've found.

Very easy and delicious recipe that can be altered to your liking.  I've added green peppers to the browned chicken as well as I've also added frozen green peas prior to baking.  Both ways we loved the simplicity of this meal.

My husband and I loved this dish, but to be honest, I made quite a few changes to the original recipe. I sauteed my chicken breasts in olive oil with salt, pepper, garlic, parsley, basil, and Tastefully Simple's Onion Onion seasoning. I used cavatappi pasta since I had that on hand and my husband is not a big fan of spaghetti noodles. For the sauce I used chicken broth instead of water and boullion and I added the drippings from the chicken along with more garlic, pepper, and Onion Onion seasoning. I have to cook with a lot of seasoning.... cannot stand it when food is bland! Finally, I mixed together some shredded cheddar cheese, italian seasoning, and panko bread crumbs for a crunchy topping. After all was said and done, it came out wonderful and we will definitely make this again and again!!!

I think this recipe has potential with a few changes. But first, I do not know how anyone can fit all these ingredietns into a single 9 X 13. I had to use a separate smaller dish to fit it all--I'd use fewer noodles next time.  Also, it's a little bland as is, I'd prob either use cream of mushroom soup or just add mushroom. I'd probably also add some onions when I boil the broth.

This recipe was awesome!! I just made one small change; rather than using two cans of cream of chicken soup, I used one can of cream of chicken and one can of Campbell's Fiesta Nacho Cheese Soup. Hnnnggg... So good. The nacho cheese soup added a *teensy* kick of spice and the peppers in the soup gave the tetrazzini a little more texture.

I cook the chicken with garlic powder and Italian seasoning, use one can of cream of chicken with herbs, one can of cream of chicken and mushroom by Campbell's, and add a can of drained mushrooms. I also find that 1/4 of a cup of cheese isn't enough, so I use a whole small bag of mixed sharp and mild chedder (the kind you can buy for $2 to $3).I also find it's best to get the chicken to just barely cooked before baking so it doesn't dry out during the bake time.

This was a great recipe for me, I had all the ingredients and it was quick. I cubed the chicken and browned it in the butter with garlic powder, onion powder and salt. Then I used penne instead, did not want to go to the grocery store! I mixed all the ingredients including the cheese in a bowl amputee them combined into the baking dish. Lastly I sprinkled some Parmesan cheese and put it in the oven. The top was crispy and my family like it. Next time I will probably add some veggies, like asparagus or brócoli. Thank se,

I think adding the chicken bouillon to the soup mixture is what gives this recipe the kick that it needs to add flavor.

Pretty tasty!  Rather than water and bullion, I used low-salt chicken broth.  I also added seasoning specific for chicken, and used leftover roast chicken.  Rather than spaghetti I used fusilli.  This will be great reheated too.  Easy to make and cooked quickly.  Even though I tweaked it a bit, thanks for posting this recipe!

Awesome dinner!! I'm sure this would still have been a 5 star meal without my additions, but I love to add sautéed diced onion,  red bell pepper and celery (and garlic at the end of the sautéing) to a lot of my meals. And I seasoned the raw chicken pieces with pepper and Lawry's Seasoned Salt before cooking on the stove in a little EVOO. I also used chicken broth instead of water and bouillon. The only thing I will do differently next time is break up the spaghetti before cooking (or after cooking chop it up a bit more) since it was hard to get helpings out of the casserole dish. Or maybe I should have used tongs instead of a very large spoon. This was rich and creamy and will definitely make often. Thanks Marian.

Hi all, this was great and brought me back to the first time I ever ate chicken tetrazzini. I cut the recipe in half, used fetuccini noodles, and added about 1/2 sauteed onion with 2 sauteed garlic cloves as well as about 1/3 cup frozen peas. I also added probably about 1/2 to 1 full tsp of onion powder and garlic powder, as well as salt and pepper and a tiny bit of garlic salt and Italian seasoning for flavor. This came out delicious and not at all as thick and heavy as I had assumed. The only downside is that some of my chicken felt dry/overcooked, so maybe just lightly cook the outside of the chicken before baking the casserole? Otherwise, delicious...I couldn't get enough of it last night.

We really liked this dish, but I did make a change or two: I added a fair amount of seasoning (dried garlic and onion and a dried Italian mix of herbs) and just used chicken broth in place if the boullion and water (makes it a little too salty for my taste). My 8 year old asked when id be making it again!

I really liked the outcome and will definitely make it again!  I halved the recipe, and used one cup of broth in place of the water.  I didn't use any cheese.  Since I like onions, I sauteed about 1/4 onion and a stalk of celery in the butter before the soup, broth mixture was boiled. Black pepper was added (generously) on top of the chicken and after the soup,broth/ butter layer. No bouillon was used, but it was tasty, for sure!
Thank you, Marian, for submitting this recipe!

I will admit that I used leftover grilled chicken, but even with that, I thought it was just ok.  Needed salt and was a little too runny.  I think it has a lot of potential, though.

Love this recipe.  So simple. I had all the ingredients so it took no time to prepare and cook.  I used 2 cans mushroom soup because it is all I had and cut back to 2 cups of water.  I topped it with a mixture of extra old cheddar and grated Parmesan.  Everyone loved it.  I have already sent it onwards. Thank you

I made this gluten free by using gf barilla spaghetti,  progresso mushroom soup and a gluten free organic "something" chicken soup. I used only 1 cup of water but could have probably used less (like 3/4 cup) because the soup was not condensed it came out a little watery until it cooled. It was pretty good but like many people say... bland. I like plain butter noodles though so I didn't mind.

This was delicious and my husband said this is a definite keeper.    I used chicken broth, instead of water because I did not have any bouillon cubes.   Thanks for a great recipe.

I cut the chicken down to 3. I should have cut the noodles down too so it would have more sauce. Added Rosemary, pepper, garlic to the sauce. It would have been bland otherwise. Good base recipe to refer to.

I use bouillon granules, so I went heavy on that when I made the sauce mixture.  Also added, garlic, onion powder, salt and pepper in the pot.  Heavily seasoned the chicken breast with Tastefully simple Garlic Garlic, McCormick chicken seasoning, and lemon pepper.  You need WAY more than 1/4 cheddar cheese.  I bet I used close to 1 1/2 cups.  I also mixed some melted butter with some panko bread crumbs that I sprinkled on top before baking.  With modifications, this was a tasty recipe that everyone liked.  As is, bleh.

I used cream of chicken and herbs. I also added a touch of garlic salt to the noodles while boiling.  Overall very easy and quick.

This gets 5 stars simply because my extremely picky son loved it!

I use chicken legs. I simply boiled them with dried oregano, rosemary, thyme  black pepper, season salt and garlic powder.  I then removed the legs, added 2 cups of water and v
cooked my spaghetti in the broth. I didn't have cream of chicken soup, instead used cream of mushroom. Drained the pasta and mixed with soup mixture before adding to baking dish. Topped off with a mixture of cheddar and mozzarella cheese. Next time plan to add bacon and sliced green onions.

This was delicious! I cooked the chicken in broth and added some seasonings as others suggested. I made it with spaghetti noodles but I think I would use egg noodles next time to soak up all that wonderful flavor. My whole family loved this!

Great quick and flavorful recipe!  I did alter a bit. We only had gluten free penne pasta so i used that. While cooking the chicken the last couple of minutes, I added 1/2 cup of chopped onion, some fresh spinach and about a 1/2 cup of chopped mushrooms. Then  seasoned with minced garlic and pepper.

 For the sauce...we didn't have cream of chicken, but had cream of mushroom soup. In addition, I used about 2 tablespoons of Italian seasoning, garlic, and black pepper.

 Finally I sprinkled with cheddar cheese as directed, but also added grated parmesan cheese, parsley , and seasoned breadcrumbs for added texture. I cooked at 350 covered with foil for 15 min. Then cooked for 10 minutes with  foil off. 

My husband only left the decoration on the plate! Delicious!!

This was a great quick recipe. I've never made chicken tetrazzini and had been wanting to give it a try. This seemed simple enough to follow and had great reviews, so I tried it. Glad I did. My son cleaned his plate. I seasoned the chicken with garlic powder, salt, & pepper and sauteed in butter, poured the juices over the chicken and then poured the cream of chicken mixture as the recipe calls for. Simple and delish. Thanks for sharing!

I've used this recipe several times as a base.  I saute my chicken (I cut it up first) with onions and mushrooms in just a little olive oil and season it with Tony Chachere's creole seasoning, salt, and pepper. *If I don't want the spice I skip the Tony's and opt for garlic powder and salt* I also add a half cup of milk to the cream of chicken mix because it dries out to quickly after removing it from the oven.  This is a highly requested meal in my house!

I made a smaller recipe using 1 can of soup and 1/4 cup dry vermouth and 1/4 cup regular sour cream to cut saltiness of the soup.  Did not add any additional liquid other than a splash of Worcestershire Sauce. Added some garlic and thyme. Casserole cooled about 20 minutes before being served.  A lot of liquid in bottom of dish.  I was expecting a fully incorporated cream-type sauce.  Have no idea why the sauce would separate.

This extremely good, really easy to make and my kids LOVE it. I have made it several times. I stopped putting the butter in it, mostly because I accidentally left it out when I was pregnant and liked it better because the richness made me sick at that time. I haven't put it back since. Today I decided to swap out the cream of chicken for poblano and queso because I love those flavors. We'll see how it goes!

This was really good! I tweaked the recipe for what I had on hand. Penne instead of spaghetti and subbed a can of cream of celery instead of chicken (I noticed another recipe called for chopped celery so really it worked out in my favor). It was super easy to throw together and actually tasted better as leftovers!

Made it a 5-star by adding Parmesan cheese, cream of chicken soup with herbs, and seasoning the chicken before cooking.  Kids love it.  They want me to make it every week.

I used whole wheat rotini noodles instead and a can of cream of chicken and a can of cream of mushroom.  Sprinkled it with Parmesan  cheese before baking.  My kids loved it!  Even my picky eaters. It was a little dryer than I expected and I will use more cheese the next time and more cream of chicken to be more creamer. But it was a hit with my family! :)

Nice and easy. I changed up a little. I didn't have Cream of Chicken and subbed Cream of Celery & Mushroom. I also added black olives, marinated artichoke and spinach for some color. It was awesome. Next time I will add cheese to sauce and sprinkle with bread crumbs.

This recipe says it makes 8 servings, but really, it makes more than that even.  
I wasn't sure how this was going to go over with my kids, but they absolutely loved it.  All 4 members of our family went back for seconds, plus we had a bunch leftover that my husband took to share at work the next day. I followed the recipe to a T, even weighing out the spaghetti to make sure I had the right amount.
This was a quick, easy recipe that my whole family enjoyed. I highly recommend it.

Really good.  I boiled chicken breasts with the bone and skin on with onion, celery, carrots, bay leaves, salt and pepper to make my own stock which I used instead of water and bullion cubes.  I also mixed the pasta, shredded chicken, cheese, and mixed vegetables in with the soup, stock and spices and poured into a pan.  I used crushed corn flakes as a crunchy topper.

Yes tried it & loved it now I make it all the time ESP in a pinch.   Quick & easy   All that have had it loved it.  Just need a veggie to serve with it or in it  & good to go.  Have frozen it to have on hand.   Make it , freeze it.   Cover   & heat @ 350 for 2 hours. Can add additional cheese  if  needed.  
 Have used spaghetti, angel hair. All work    
   If a little soupy  add extra cheese &   Gently push   The cheese down into the mixture  & more cheese around the edges helps too

this tasted good, there was nothing wrong with the taste. it was just kind of sloppy, like someone forgot to buy tomato for a spaghetti and just dumped chicken flavor on it and added actual chicken as an afterthought. and it's very soupy but not easy enough to eat with a spoon.

Yum! My hubby actually liked it. I used egg noodles instead of spaghetti. Nicer flavor in my opinion.

Just OK.  Made pretty much as written except added just a bit of onion and garlic and increased cheese.  Probably won't make again.

This was an OK recipe. I cut the recipe in half for the 2 of us. I spiced the chicken up by cooking with 4 or 5 cloves of fresh chopped garlic, about 1/2 an onion and a tbsp of Montreal chicken spice. I used one can of mushroom soup and one can of chicken broth. If I make it again I will only use 1/2 a can of broth. I added a hand full of baby carrots, coarsely chopped, and several mushrooms to the baking pan. The carrots came out quite crunchy, which is the way we like them.

Made this for dinner tonight!!  It was fantastic! I did make 2 changes to it to add a little more substance to it. I used dumpling noodles instead of spaghetti noodles and I did not cube my chicken. I basically long cut it instead!!  Thank you Marian Collins for this recipe!!!

Used wheat pasta and used clam chowder soup since that was what I had in the house. Turned out great!! Also added a blackened seafood spice.  Used the broiler at the end for a crispy top--to the cheese and noodles on the top.

Awesome recipe for a beginner cook such as myself! Like many others, I made modifications, but I'm giving it 5 stars because I wouldn't have made this had I not seen it and it's very versatile. Not to mention, my family really loved it which makes me happy, so I'll be adding this to my 'recipe box'. The modifications I made were to make it tasty but as easy & quickly as possible due to busy schedules. I used the 1lb spaghetti boiled in water, salt & olive oil, drained noodles saving about a cup of the water. I put the noodles & the cup of pasta water in a bowel to keep them from sticking & drying. From the store I bought pre-chopped onion (about 1 cup), pre-chopped mixed yellow,  green, and red bell peppers (combined about 1 cup), pre-cut bella mushrooms,  fresh cilantro (on sale!) I sautéed all of these, (except the cilantro)in some olive oil, very little kosher salt & pepper. Added 1/4 cup chopped cilantro to veggie mix after sautéing. Shredded roasted chicken and put in pan with veggies. I added 1 can cream of mushroom with roasted garlic (Campbells), 1 can cream of chicken with herbs (Campbells) and 1 can of Campbells chicken broth in place of the water. Make sure to use a large pan or transfer to a large bowl. I added a little Italian seasoning to my tastes,  mixed it all up. Drained the rest of the water from my noodles, put noodles in pan, put mixture in pan, mixed again (a little messy!) :) Once it was mixed evenly, I used the whole package of sharp shredded cheddar o

Lives up to it's name: Easy. It's also quite delicious. Could be creamier if 2-3oz of cream cheese were added to the sauce? I added little more cheese on top than 1/4 c.

We thought this was very good, but like most other reviewers, I doctored it up with onions, mushrooms, celery, and garlic which I sautéd beforehand.  Maybe a little extra liquid would be a good idea if you're making enough for leftovers another night.

Ok, I had some leftover chicken breasts in the fridge, so I thought I'd give this a shot.  This is a great recipe as written and can be made better with your own tweeks.  I always try to read a few others notes,  gives a good head start.   
I used half broth half water for both the sauce and boiling the noodles.  Unfortunately I also used 1 bullion cube, I believe may have been my shortcoming on this one.  While it's still good,  it's a bit salty for myand my families taste.  I added killer cajun by garlic gourmet cuz well I pretty much put that stuff on everything.  I also made a typing of 3 parts bread crumbs 2 part parm cheese. 
So,  notes to self for next time,  low sodium broth, low sodium soups no bouillon cube and a touch more killer cajun.

This was a good base recipe.  I added onions, pepper, milk in place of the water, and I only used 1 can of cream of chicken.  I also added 8 oz. of cream cheese.  The "sauce" was flavorful and creamy.  I sprinkled the top with parmesan rather than cheddar. My family really enjoyed this dish.  Thank you!

Very good recipe but I think adding bouillon made it very salty. Next time I will not be adding it. Also, I put also a little bit of milk in the soup.

This is a great basic recipe.  I boiled my chicken with garlic powder, lemon pepper, minced onion, salt and pepper.  I then strained the broth and cooked angel hair pasta in it.  I used 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can cream of mushroom and added garlic powder, minced onion, salt and pepper to it. (I can't tell you how much, after years of cooking, I just know).  I didn't have a lot of shredded cheddar cheese so I used mozzerella along with the cheddar and also used bread crumbs on top of that.  My family LOVED this dish.  So simple, so easy!!!!

This recipe is easy to prepare and delicious. I cut the recipe in half since it is just two of us. I cooked the chicken with onion, and I also added peas to the spaghetti as it was finishing cooking. I used two chicken breasts (since that is how they come packaged from Costco.) I was very pleased with the result. The spaghetti was moist and creamy. I used an Italian cheese blend lightly sprinkled on the top and it was yummy.

I used this recipe as a basis for my own spin. I sauteed 2 cups of fresh mushrooms, 1/2 red onion, and 3 celery stalks all thinly sliced in 2 TBSP butter, made a classic bechamel sauce (4 cups), added 1/2 cup shredded cheese to my bechamel, mixed everything together and then topped with more shredded cheese and baked at 350 degrees for 25 minutes. I think a bechamel is fresher, more affordable and healthier than canned soups. I think 3 large chicken breasts provide more than enough meat, no need for 5.

It was OK, but needed alot of jazzing up to make it taste better. This feels to me like more of a base recipe. If you make it as written, it is very bland and boring.

This Chicken Tetrazzini is great. I added some spinach into the mix which tasted even better.

Very tasty.  I halved the recipe as I only had one can of cream of mushroom on hand.  I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, italian seasoning and minced garlic.  I stirred all of my ingredients together before topping with cheese.  We nearly always have pasta, cheese, chicken and soups for cooking in our house, so this will definitely be a go-to recipe.  Thanks!

I accidently doubled the amount of water! I did two CUPS of bouillon instead of 2 cubes. It was runny when it came out of the oven and I let it stand and it was perfect... and DELICIOUS!!!!  I added some extra seasoning to it and even used fat free soup and it was great! And soooo easy!

this is good but I recommend adding some frozen vegetables for extra flavor and nutrition. I added a bag of green giant steamer vegetables. The frozen vegetables had cranberries in as well which added a nice sweet kick

Easy and great tasting. I used penne, store-bought already roasted chicken, and lots of pepper for taste. I put the chicken and noodles in the dish, poured the sauce in, added shredded cheese, mixed it all up (adding pepper while mixing), and then topped with more cheddar cheese. Turned out great.

Really easy and super tasty. I used homemade chicken broth (because that's all I ever use), skinned rotisserie chicken and extra sharp cheddar and it turned out delicious. I especially liked the fact that there were no onions or garlic in the recipe. My father cannot eat these and when I brought him leftovers (there were lots) he was so happy to have something so yummy that he could eat!

I boiled the chicken in chicken stock, and when that was complete, cooked the spaghetti in the sauce liquid. This kept a good chicken flavor. I added cream of broccoli, which brought a great flavor.

This was a pretty good start. It needs more but of what I don't know yet because I haven't made it again. I did use Angel hair pasta though and also added diced green chili's. It needs to be thicker.

I have been making this for years! I do add 1 jar of mushrooms and do 1 can cream of chicken soup and 1 can cream of mushroom. I love serving this to my friends and every single person that has tried it loves it! It makes so much food too! I think I am going to try it without chicken next.

Absolutely excellent! I boiled the chicken and shredded, added mushrooms and cut up yellow onion, and also added garlic powder, crushed red pepper flakes, and season all. Very very good! Topped it with mozzerella because I didn't have the other cheese. Next time I might use whole grain pasta. Most certainly will eat this again!

I boiled the chicken as many of you had suggested in order to reserve the stock water to use in the tetrazzini.  It really did give the dish an excellent chicken flavor.  However, I ended up with some pretty dry chicken [my own fault] :(  I think I may have been better off going with the canned chicken as others have mentioned.  Overall, though, this was quite a wonderful dish with great chicken flavor.

This was delicious. I made it with angel hair pasta and CoChicken and CoMushrooms. I used garlic and onion powder along with chicken seasoning from McCormick and some Italian seasonings. I added canned peas and spinach. I also boiled chicken in broth and it made my house smell amazing! I added cheddar cheese to the mixture and then sprinkled some on top. Everyone loves it and I will definitely make this again! Thanks!

My family really liked this...even my picky 4 year old!  I used chicken broth instead of the water and chicken boullion cubes.  I also added about 1/4c. cream cheese to the sauce and threw in some frozen peas like some other reviewers had recommended.  Egg noodles worked great with this!  I thought it was great and it's made the monthly menu at my house.

Made this tonight and boyfriend ate 3 helpings and gave it two thumbs up because his mouth was so full when I asked him if he liked it!! I read the comments left and did the following, cooked chicken with garlic powder, onion powder, and cooked it in the skillet with chicken broth. To the pasta I before baking it I added corn, broccoli, and mushrooms. (all drained) I added the cheese and bread crumbs after ten minutes of cook time in order to keep the cheese from getting hard. This was great, will make again!!!  Thanks! =)

Lazy cook here tonight and this recipe gave perfect direction to help me figure out what to make! I made a 1/2 recipe using leftover spaghetti, 1can cream of chicken, and 1can chunky chicken noodle w/about 1/2cup of cheddar on top and a little red pepper added to the soups. Came out a nice consistency and was SUPER easy!

Very bland!  Even when using cream of celery and cream of chicken, adding onions, using broth instead of water, topping with flavored bread crumbs...even the next day, still blah!  And with today's chickens, you don't need 5 breasts.  I used 3 and that still seemed too much.  Won't make again.

I cooked the chicken with lots of spices and even boiled the noodles in chicken broth, like others suggested. Still way too bland. It was worth a try, though.

My husband called this a good "safe" meal. Even when I spiced it up, its not too interesting...but also nothing offensive about it. Its a great dish to take to to a family after they have a baby or when you're trying to please picky kids. :) Here are the changes I made: I sauteed the chicken in evoo and sprinkled it with a generous amount onion and garlic powder, parsley and a little black pepper. I added frozen chopped broccoli on top of the chicken layer then poured the sauce over it. It looks too soupy at that point, but thickens up perfectly. Then following other suggestions, I sprinkled seasoned bread crumb over the cheese.  We'll make it again.

Absolutely wonderful. I used one 4 cups of chicken broth plus water when boiling my noodles to give them a good flavor, then used the pasta broth/water mix instead of water for the sauce. If you like the taste of mushrooms try using one can cream of mushroom soup in place of one of the cans of cream of chicken soup.

Loved this recipe!!  I changed it up a bit though. I added broccoli and some onions to it and used 1 can of cream of mushroom soup. I thought the soups would be a bit runny so I added 1/2 a brick of light cream cheese to the soup mix. It was FABULOUS!! My kids couldn't get enough!

This was awesome! It's just what I remembered from being young. For that extra chicken flavoring, I boiled my spaghetti in chicken bouillon water. Mmmmm!

This is one of my favorite recipes. The trick to making this extraordinary is to cook your noodles in chicken broth. It gives them the most amazing flavor. I cook my chicken in water w/ butter and salt. I also add a can of mushrooms bc we love mushrooms.

Tasty recipe. I sauteed minced garlic in olive oil, then added the cubed chicken, seasoned with seasoning salt. When the chicken was cooked, I saved the juices and replaced some of the water with it. I added sour cream and cream chease, also onion/garlic powder. My only complaint would be that it was a little too salty -- I might cut back on the bouillon.

I made as called for but did add 1/4 tsp of both garlic powder and onion powder as others had suggested, but it still wasn't enough oomph. (Hence the 3.) Everyone ate it, but my husband, myself and the kids all thought it needed something. I did add a small can of mushrooms, which was the only part that really had much flavor...wish I had added more. It was fairly easy to make, so if I did make it again I will definitely use more black pepper (and maybe even some cayenne), plus more garlic and more onion powder. I might even stir some cheese into the mixture, but I had tripled it already to about 3/4 C. Maybe even some sundried tomatoes would be good in this?

Thank you Marian! This is great. Minor change I made - mixed in (1/2 cup) cheese and topped with bread crumbs instead. Will be making this again.

Not bad if you need to pull an easy &  fast meal together.  I made exactly as described and I thought it was a little bland, sort of like chicken noodle soup without the broth.

This was tasty - might make again. I put some broccoli in between the pasta and chicken. Although I have to say, I found this to be much tastier the night after (leftovers) after I reheated it in the oven.

We made this for kids at a cross country camp.  We layered rotini pasta in place of the spaghetti with chicken, parmesan, cheddar, and mozerella.  We added sour cream to the liquid mixture.  The kids and adults loved it.  Easy and delicious.

So tasty! I took the suggestion of switching 1 cream of chicken for a cream of broccoli. Delicious! I added frozen green beans so the dish could be an all-in-one. My 13 month old devoured it! I am adding this to the family cookbook. Thanks!

I increased the portions for 140 and it came out amazing. The chicken stock, onions, celery, cheese, and cream of mushrooms and chicken made this a hit. I used Italian style bread crumbs and parm cheese on top. The crust was to die for. Only think I would change would be the use of mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar.

I only gave this recipe 3 stars the way it is written, but 5 stars if you add seasonings. As it is it would be VERY bland! I sauteed the chicken in oil with minced garlic, paprika, red pepper flakes, thyme, rosemary, black pepper, oregano, and lemon pepper. Then I stirred the condensed soup, bouillon, butter and water in with the chicken and followed the recipe from there. So GOOD!

I used evaporated milk instead of water  and boiled the pasta in chicken broth as other people suggested and used cream of chicken with Herbs...it really added great flavor.  The original version would be just great, too, I'm sure.  The family really gobbled it up!  Pretty easy too!  Thanks for the recipe!  It's a keeper.

This recipe was a great find because I had the ingredients on hand and limited time. I used two 12.5oz cans of chicken, reserving the broth for part of the water needed and omitted the boullion. I like the added zip of mexican style sour cream, so I substituted that for one of the cans of soup and also used about 1 Tbs minced garlic from a jar. Husband and family loved it, it's the new favorite. Thanks for the recipe!

This is easy....but a little bland.Wondering if it is because I didn't add the butter.

I made this recipe for my family and it turned out great.  I did add spices to kick up the flavor.  I used garlic powder, thyme, onion powder and sage.  I cooked my chicken in water and spices then took the chicken out and used that water to boil my noodles....I used egg noodles as my family does not car for the other noodles.. I also added the same spices to the boiled mixture and it turned out good.  I use chicken broth insted of the water/boul. mixture.  and i used colby and montaray jack cheese mixture on top insted of chedder.  My family loved the meal and has requested it to go into the family roatation

This was really yummy- its a great base recipe- I doctored it up a bit- sauteed the chix with spices, added a splash of sherry to the soup mix along with the cheese- mixed it all together- baked it- and then added the ritz cracker crumbs at the end- we all loved it. Next time I will have spaghetti for dinner the night before- and make extra noodles for this dish

I used one can of cream of chicken, one can of cream of mushroom, added 1/2 teaspoon of minced garlic, salt & pepper, frozen broccoli florets and   1 1/4 cups shredded cheddar on the top. A real hit with the whole family including both teenage boys(except they removed the broccoli before they ate it). Will definitely rotate this into the supper menu every couple of months.

This has become a family favorite, even with my picky little ones. I use one can broccoli cheese soup and the equivalent to a can of homemade cream of chicken soup mix.  I  add some frozen vegetables - peas, corn, mixed, whatever I have on hand.

This was very good.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe and it was a little plain.  Next time I make it I will follow some of the suggestions of the other reviewers and add some seasonings.

Very simple and tasty. I did add sauted onions, mushrooms, and bell peppers; I also sprinkled a little lemon pepper on top. No bread crumbs on hand, so I used french-fried onions.  The crunch offers a nice contrast.  I also used mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar.  Will definitely make again!

I don't like leftover chicken in anything, but everything else in this recipe was so good it didn't matter. I added, like one reviewer suggested, panko breadcrumbs mixed with some shredded cheese and melted butter to the top 5 min. before taking it out. This recipe was really good.

This was a really simple and tasty way to use some turkey leftovers.  I also added in some sauteed shallots to give it a bit more taste & some cooked broccoli so we could get our veggies in.  Overall, I think it could have used a bit more flavor depth, but it was pretty good considering how simple it threw together.  And my son (the picky eater)loved it, so that makes it a winner for sure.

I love this recipe!!! I make it at least once a month!! I use 1 can of cream of mushroom and 1 can of cream of chicken. I also add fresh thyme, onion, celery and bell pepper to my chicken while it is cooking and instead of water I use chicken broth I also use angel hair pasta. This recipe is a family favorite at pot luck gatherings.

Very good and super easy to make with ingredients already on hand. Our group decided that next time we'll add diced onion, diced celery, mushrooms, and cashews for more crunch. I also added a can of mixed vegetables to make it a little more healthy :)

This was pretty good.  Almost like a hearty soup.  Great for a cold day!
I used 1 cup of chicken stock instead of bouillon and that seemed to work just fine.  It was pretty runny, but not too bad.  I also added fresh ground pepper to the soup/broth mix and pepper when serving.  I would probably make this again!

Very good recipe. I did not bake mine, just threw together on top of stove. I thought it was missing something so I took some bob evans maple sausage I had left over and made into tiny balls, fried up and threw them in. My boyfriend loved it!

SO GOOD! I have the longer, harder version of this recipe so this is such a nice change and the best part is that the kids love it. The only thing I added was some veggies to the chicken, such as celery, red pepper, and mushrooms. I also added 2T of cooking sherry to the soup mixture. I'll be making this again and again. Thanks so much for posting it!!

Super easy and very tasty.
I added breadcrumbs, as others suggested.  I also cooked my chicken in a pan, and used the water and soup to deglaze the pan.  It gave everything a nice, complex chicken flavor.  Definitely will make again.

Had left chicken that I needed to use.  Made this for lunch today.  My family enjoyed it.  The tetrazzini had a great taste.  This recipe makes a lot of food.
The only thing I changed was the addition of pimentos for color.

Everyone from kids to great-grandmother loved the results of this recipe! It was easy, too!
  I used the mushroom/cream of chicken combo, and the chicken cooking water, although about 3/4C. less than called for, as it seemed soupy rather than saucy when mixing.  The cheese topping is a nice touch, and whatever you have on hand or prefer can be substituted...I have not had mozzarella, and think that would be good though perhaps bland.  The cheddar I used both times I made this, added zing.

This was very very good! I added about 2 heaping spoonfuls of sour cream to the broth mix right before I poured it onto the noodles and chicken. It added a great flavor! Loved this dish!

My kids and I loved this. My hubby only liked the chicken part. Over all it was yummy. I added Italian seasoning to it to give it more flavor.

Large family of 5 that loves almost everything.  Surprised at all the 5 stars...we thought this dish was very bland.  Would change up the recipe if I were to make it again, but it got vetoed in the soccer house:(

This was so good.  My husband loved it.  I made the recipe exactly.  I'm thinking the next time I have left over chicken or pasta this is the perfect recipe.  I would be able to put it together in just a few minutes.  Definitely a keeper!

This was so yummy!  My husband is already wanting me to make it again!  I boiled my chicked with some onions and seasonings (garlic salt and pepper).  I then used the same water to cook the noodles.  I used 1 can cream of mushroom in place of one of the cans of cream of chicken soup.  I also used bread crumbs on top of cheese.  It turned out really yummy which is a good thing because that meant left overs!!

I did as others suggested and used one can of cream of chicken and then I used a can of roasted garlic cream of mushroom.  I sauteed some onions, fresh garlic and a can of mushrooms before adding the soup mixture.  I also used chicken broth instead of water. It came out delicious! Thank you.

Very flexible recipe. I sauteed fresh garlic and onion to bump up the taste. Then I threw in some chopped broccili and red bell pepper. I also mixed parmesean, mozzerella and cheddar cheeses.   Then I added basil, oregano and fresh parsley. I didn't layer anything, just mixed it all together. Even my picky husband ate seconds. Now that's a compliment!!

Well my school makes this at least once every 2 weeks. It's so good. They put carrots in it which adds to the fun factor. They cut em into long strips. Sometimes they put broccoli, just depends.

I made this last night with the following changes: omitted the chicken bouillion and cream of mushroom and garlic was substituted for cream of chicken.  I used milk instead of water and also cooking sherry (1/2 of that and 1/2 of milk).  This is a simple recipe that I believe can be adapted to suit your tastes.  My picky eaters went back for seconds!  I will put this in my recipe rotation and perhaps try it with cream of shrimp soup and shrimp instead of chicken.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.  We will definitely share it with others and make it often instead of just spaghetti.

This a great basic recipe that can be adapted to your families taste. I sauteed a can of mushrooms and a diced sweet onion and added to it. I used 1 can cream of chicken soup & a half can of cream of mushroom with roasted garlic with 1 can milk. I also added garlic powder to the soup mix and chicken. Delish!

I cut the recipe in half, and used about half of a supermarket rotisserie chicken. Added a little (tsp) crushed garlic to the sauce, plus about 3 oz of light cream cheese that needed to go, and probably way too much sharp cheddar. A really good recipe that I'll make again. Others in the house loved it and would like it every week till the end of time. Very good leftovers, too.

This went over very well with my family. I layered some sauteed onions and garlic, and sprinkled some basil on top of the noodles prior to the soup mixture and also mixed some mozzarella with the cheddar for the top.

Surprisingly good!  It didn't look appetizing at all coming out of the oven, but it was delicious!  I left out the butter and bouillon, instead adding a little olive oil and chicken broth.  I used leftovers from a whole roasted chicken.  Quick, easy, few ingredients, and great with some added frozen veggies.  This will be a staple recipe for me!

This was delicious!  I read some of the reviews and modified the recipe as well.  I sauted red bell peppers, mushrooms & onions and added it to the soup mixture.  I also added oregano and garlic powder.  I cooked the chicken in olive oil and garlic with salt and pepper.  Also, instead of layering all the ingredients as the recipe said, I mixed everything together in a big bowl.  And instead of cheddar cheese, I used Mozzerella cheese on top.  My family loved it.

This recipe was on point!!! I added some campbells fiesta cheese condensed soup to give it a cheesy, yet spicy flavor. I also sauteed some bell pepper, onions, and garlic in a saucepan before adding the condensed soup. This recipe was easy and didn't take long to prepare. It was very tasty!!!

Based on other's suggestions, I sauteed onion, green pepper, celery to add to chicken. I also used two cans of cream of mushroom soup and a splash of sherry. I used angel hair pasts but should have broken the noodles before boiling. Very good!

This was pretty simple and good! I also added 1 can of 98% fat free cream of chicken and cream of mushroom.  I also replaced the water with low sodium chicken broth.  I also added some pepper and garlic to the creamy mixture.  I wanted to add some veggies to make this a more wholesome meal so I added frozen peas and carrots as well as fresh sliced mushrooms.  I had REAL chicken Tet the other weekend-- it was really good but really fattening with the heavy cream, etc. and this is a very tasty, healthier alternative!

For more flavor use capers and 1/2 cup of dry white wine instead of some broth. Add your favorite vegetables and make the kids happy by topping it with crushed potato chips and grated cheddar.  I use unsalted broth to compensate for the salt in the chips.

The first thing you would have to know before you make this dish is that it looks better than it taste.
It is very easy to make and can easily feed a hungry family of 6 or more.
I would recommend adding half a bag of frozen veggies to give it more color.
Other than that its a great dish that easy to make in less than 40 minutes (includes cooking and prep time)

Very good & easy casserole. I used dry egg noodles vs. spaghetti noodles because it's what I had on hand & they worked out well; I'll probably use those noodles next time. Also, my family & I thought it could use less chicken & more cheese. I used 3 giant bone-in chicken breasts that I boiled & deboned the night before & a little more than about 1/3 cup of cheese. However, it was too much chicken & too little cheese. It's a great recipe that I will use again with these changes.

This recipe was great! Even if some expert called it a heavy pasta. it was amazing! I might try a few of the things other people suggested. But either way it's an amazing dish and I know that I will be serving this as a side dish on Christmas Day Dinner. Its great leftovers too!! Thank you so much for sharing.

The taste was great, but the dish was not that pretty.  The shredded cheese just looked unappetizing on top so I  think I will mix the cheese in before baking next time.   I also added a boullion cube while cooking the noodles andbreadcrumbs on top.  As for the prep...very easy!

This was great!!  I also substituted chicken broth for the water and I mixed extra cheese in with the soup.  I used a cheese blend of cheddar, colby and monteray jack.  Very creamy.  We all loved it!

This was a kind of bland... I felt like it needed something but was not bad.  Maybe so so.

This was good but did a few changes after reading some of the other reviews. I used a can of cream of chicken and a can of cream of mushroom. I added a 1/4 tsp of garlic powder and a 1/4 tsp of pepper. Also used chicken broth instead of water then omitted the butter and boullion. I also added a lot more cheese probably around 2 cups.

This was excellent! My changes were
I sauted onion in butter added
soup, dried basil, pepper, and a small
amount of red pepper.  For the liquid I used 1/2 milk and 1/2 white white. I also added a handful of chedder cheese
to the soup mixture and simmered while
the noodles were cooking.  
This is a keeper - THANKS!

I followed a lot of what TeensyNeesie did and it came out good. I think it calls for way to much chicken so next time I will cut it down. This makes a lot so have a hungry appetite.

This was great. My family loved it. Smelled great cooking, too. We love parmesan cheese so I added some to the mixture and to the top. I will definitely make it again.

My whole family liked this one, I loved it because it was so simple to make and I had everything on hand.  My 2 year old liked it, and even my husband (who doesnt like "cream saucces") loved it.  Next time, it needs more cheese to cover the top and maybe some bread crumbs also to all some texture.

I give it a three stars as written. I marinated the chicken since other reviews call the dish bland. It helped the dish up to a four but was just blah. The kids loved it.

This recipe was very easy to make, however, it lacked in flavor.  What flavor it had was because I covered the chicken in spices before cooking them.  I also added french fried onions to the top.  I would make again, but I will definitely add more spices and more soup.

Very good and fast for family meal although it seemed to be missing "something".  I used leftover roasted chicken and spinkled it with some seasoning salt before pouring the soup mixture over it.  My kids would definitely not eat it with onions, carrots, and celery as some others have suggested.  I guess I would try tweaking the seasonings a bit next time.

Fast and yummy!  I was in a hurry and used 2 large cans of Hormel White Chunk Chicken instead of chicken breasts and also, I did make an addition doing the onion, garlic and mushroom sauteed in butter and poured the mixture over the chicken, before adding the soup (as suggested).  I believe this added good flavor to the dish, which would otherwise be a tad bland.  This recipe makes a ton of food and is great leftover!  Thanks for an easy meal!

I was not pleased with this dish. The tomato paste mixture was fine, however it overpowered the delicate taste of the fish. As a result, all I could taste was the tomato paste. I suggest seasoning the fish prior to adding the mixture. Also, do not use a large onion, it is way too much. I will most likely not be making this dish again.

Loved this!  We are without a kitchen and I had leftover italian bbqed chicken and spaghetti pasta.  I actually microwaved it and added sour cream and italian dressing.  It was a lifesaver to have a meal at home without a kitchen - thanks!

Something went wrong when I made this. I cut it in half since I was only feeding three and it was bland. Others have complained of saltiness but I didn't taste much of anything. However, my parents LOVED it. I would make it again for them but not myself. Too watery.

Actually pretty tasty, will make again. I used a milder cheese (Mont. Jack) and some parmesan and also added a few seasonings to the sauce. I halved the recipe and it made plenty! VERY easy!

This was a keeper.  Next time I might add more cheese or try another type, as others have recommended.  Otherwise, both toddler and picky diet-restricted husband loved it.

Really good.  I'll add gouda cheese in addition to the sharp cheddar and mozzarella next time.  I'll probably also add some oregano and\or black pepper before topping with cheeses and baking.

It was very good. I used fettuccine noodles, I suppose there is no real difference in that though. I'd probably add some pepper to it next time.

This was a great, bake-all-in-one-dish casserole.  I enjoyed the simplicity of it, and it tasted good too.  I always keep Louis Rich cooked chicken strips in my freezer, so that's what I used.  It worked fine.

This is really good.  I didn't have cheddar cheese on hand so I used a dutch cheese called Perogi.  This is also fantastic with gouda cheese grated over the top.  Be experimental with the cheese..it really makes a difference!!

This was a very quick and easy meal to prepare!  I added some spinach to add a little "umph."  There is no need to add butter to the sauce, and I'm sure that it would have been fine to use the fat-free cream of chicken soup.  Oh, and I used spinach and chive noodles instead of regluar pasta.

I had to pour pepper, parm.cheese, garlic over the top after cooking to give it a little flavor and that still wasnt enough. If I do try this recipe again I will deffinetly try to kick it up a little. Unfortunatly I am stuck with a large tupper ware of gook that will more than likely be thrown away.

This was quick and easy and not bad tasting, just too simple and bland. Nice to try, but I won't be making again.

This is very good and easy, especially if you've cooked the chicken breasts ahead of time.  I've also used cooked boneless turkey breast from the grocery store, which eliminated that pre-cooking step, and it was also delicious.
