I agree, it did not turn out very flavorful.  We thought it might need some soy sauce for a boost.

We found this delicious. I did make a few small changes based on the ingredients I had on hand. Rather than shaved ginger, I lightly coated each side with powdered ginger. I also toasted the sesame seeds before coating the fish. After adding the sesame oil I added kosher salt but no garlic pepper. Once the fish was just about done, I put it under the broiler for about 5 minutes to brown the seed crust on top. Just before serving, I poured a thin line of Trader Joe's Soyaki sauce down the middle of each piece. The fish was flavorful and juicy. Will definitely make it again.

I thought this recipe was excellent and will be making it again. The flavors are subtle, but I love sesame oil/seeds and their flavor.

I like this recipe a lot. If you don't have sesame oil you can sub olive oil. It's best with the sesame oil. I rub the fresh ginger into the fish then put on the garlic pepper, drizzle with the oil. I also drizzle with tamari and some sweet mirin to heighten the Japanese flavors. Finally, I sprinkle the sesame seeds on top. Then bake as directed.

I did toast my sesame seeds first and even a tad of soy sauce due to the other reviewers. The fish was moist but bland and boring.  I will not be making it again.

Missing something.  Not quite sure what.  Definitely needed something else though.  I put a dash of soy sauce on mine and it helped.

Whole Foods and most other stores stopped selling Mahi Mahi due to code Red overfishing; they suggested Tuna instead, due to its similar texture.

From reading the previous reviews, I doubled the ginger amount. It was awesome! My friends said that it was one of the best dishes I made in a long time. Nice! :)
