I substituted cider vinegar for the white vinegar and added 2 tablespoons of honey because the sauce was too tangy for my taste.  I also topped with sliced onion and covered the cast iron pan while baking.  The chops came out tender and juicy.  Will definitely make this again!

Pretty good and easy. I used half Cider vinegar and found it to tangy so I added a couple more spoons of brown sugar and a blob of honey. A little garlic and onion powder too. I felt when I was eating it really needed salt. I used 2 really big pork steaks. Poured half the sauce on, drained accumulated liquid after 20 mins and then poured the rest of the sauce on and finished baking. Would make again.

Holy !  These were AWESOME!  I stuck them in the oven and took my daughter to Karate class...when I got home the house smelled SOOOOO great!  I used 4 thin bone-in chops (it's all I had) and didn't change anything about the recipe - my husband said it's my best meal in a while!  The sauce is awesome!  I can't wait to try it on chicken breasts too!!!  THANK YOU!  My husband thanks you too!

This recipe came out very moist and delicious...my 19 year old, who is very picky, told me it was great, so that is a big compliment!  As other users suggested, I added some garlic, onion, honey and cayenne.  I also covered for 1/2 the cooking time, drained and reapplied the sauce and cooked uncovered for the remaining time.  I also used country style boneless chops and will definitely make this again.  Thanks!

My family loved it!!  I added 1 onion, 2 cloves of minced garlic, cayenne pepper, dijon mustard and honey.  I took another users advice, doubled the sauce, used half of it during the first 30 minutes and covered it with foil, drained it off and used the other half for the last 30 minutes, removing the foil.  Great!!

I thought this was a tasteful recipe.  I liked it.  I did use boneless pork chops because that's all I had on hand.  It still came out good and the pork chops were moist.  I did double the sauce as suggested previously which gave me plenty of sauce to work with.  It was good.

This was great. I have never made BBQ pork chops before, not really a fan of pork, but my dad loves it. The recipe was super easy and I took a couple of pointers from other reviewers and used apple cider vinegar and about table spoon of honey. The sauce was perfect. Dad loved it. Would def use again.

Good basic recipe.. I used 3/4" bone in pork chop. I checked them after 45 min and they were already slightly tough but I have a convection oven so that could be the reason. Will make again but will check after 30 min. I also substituted apple cider vinegar and also added another tsp of brown sugar and added red pepper flakes, garlic powder and salt, probably about 1/2 tsp of each but didn't measure. Will keep tweaking this but was a good starter recipe. Also.. house smelled GREAT while cooking! Thanks

So simple and so tastey!  The husband loved this and the pork stayed moist.  I followed a tip from another review to cover for 30 min and then re-glaze them and uncover for the last 30 minutes.  Perfect!!

These were great!  I made as is and didnt think they were too vinegary at all!  They had a really good flavor!  Next time I think I will only cook for 45 minutes.

This recipe is by far the most popular one in my home. I have used with Pork, Chicken and Steak. I have used it in the oven, in the slow cooker and on the barbecue. The only thing you may want to change is the yield...double it or triple it. Trust me...it will not be wasted. If I could give it more than 5 stars I would. AMAZING

I made a few modifications according to my own taste and other's reviews. I only cooked two chops, but still made the same amount of sauce. For the sauce, I decreased the vinegar to 1 T, added 1 T of honey, omitted the chili powder (we're not big fans of spicy bbq sauce), and added 1/2 tsp. garlic powder, 1/2 tsp onion powder, and 1/4 tsp ground cloves. The resulting sauce had a fabulous zip and flavor without being too spicy. The cloves really made the sauce. I will be definitely be making this again and would like to make this sauce to grill with as well. As an additional note, I decreased the cooking time to 45 min (which was more than enough) and halfway through baking, I turned the chops and coated them with the second half of the sauce.

A new family favourite.  Rate it a 4 because I modified it slightly.  For 6-8 pork chops, I double the sauce mixture, double the brown sugar to total of 4tblsp., add 1/2 tsp. garlic powder, and 1/2 cup of Heinz Sweet Chili Sauce.  I also add sliced onions and a pad of butter on pork chop, bake for 5 mins. then add 1/2 the sauce and reserve the other 1/2 for dipping.  Serve with rice/mashed potatoes and grilled veggies. Ummm.

quick, easy, and very tasty.  I followed the recipe precisely.  I did cook them only about 25 minutes though and they were perfect.  I didn't use the really thick ones and didn't want them to dry out.  I should have made more for leftovers.

Made this with boneless spare ribs and it came out great!  Copied recipe exactly, but added some garlic powder and substituted cider vinegar.  I baked them with 1/2 the sauce in a cast iron skillet uncovered for 30 minutes, and then another 15 minutes covered with foil after basting them with the rest of the sauce.  Yummy!!

This was good, but I added garlic and a little molasses to this because it needed a little more sweetness and flavor.I had them with Creamy Au Gratin Potatoes. Yummy dinner!

Love the combination of ingredients but, for our taste buds, substituted lemon juice for vinegar whici certainly worked fine and didn't need to add any more sugar.   If you choose to substitute lemon juice please use only fresh..

This was delicious. I made Scalloped potatoes as a side. I didn't want to crowd the oven so I cooked the pork with the Bbq sauce in a covered saucepot for about an hour on medium. My husband loved it.Very flavorful sauce.

Made this today for dinner.  It was just like my mom used to make.  My husband who hates pork chops ate two of them. I browned my chops first and sauteed my onions and bbq sauce before pouring over the chops and putting them in the oven.  Fall off the bone tender.  Yummo.

very easy and pretty good if you like bbq sauce.  I'm not a huge fan of it, but bf likes it, so occasionally I try to make stuff with bbq sauce in it for him.  I think I accidently used 2 tablespoons of brown sugar as opposed to 2 teaspoons of brown sugar--it was pretty sweet.  Other than that, it was good, and easy.  I have thick chops, so I went ahead and followed the directions of keeping them in the oven for an hour, but I covered them for 1/2 hour, then uncovered them for the last 1/2 hour.  Worked well and bf loved them.  Thanks for the recipe!

Loved this! I was looking for something different to do with pork chops. Made this exactly as written.  This was fast, easy and so flavorful. Thank you for such a great recipe!

The chops came out dry.  I should have taken them out before the one hour. I really liked the sauce.  A very nice change from the cream of mushroom type meal.  Baked them in a dish instead of cast iron pan.  That was the only change I made.    It is worth a try.  Perhaps cover them the first half of baking.

I used a cast iron casserole pot over the stove, doubled the sauce, left out the chilli, added honey as suggested by the others, added onions and garlic. Cooked it for about 45 mins covered and left it to simmer uncovered for an hour. The result was meat falling off the bone, tender and moist. Great with mash potatoes. Hubby and girls (3 and 6) lapped it up.

Excellent recipe!  Smelled amazing while cooking.  I scaled the amounts down since there were only two of us, and the result was still great.  My fiance thoroughly enjoyed the pork chops though he felt they were a bit 'vinagry'.  They did have a good kick to them, but I would still make them again!

This sauce was so yummy. Yes, I literally licked my plate! Only gave it 4 stars because the sauce, while very tasty, was too watery. I would suggest not adding any water.

Really good.  I omitted the hot water because I like my barbecue sauce nice and thick.  I'm only giving 4 stars because my hubby, the barbecue king, thought this was just OK, but I personally loved this.  Beware that the sauce can have a bit of a kick, depending on your chili powder!

Very bland and tough.  I think my chops may have been too thick, but I had to put store bought BBQ sauce on it to salvage it.

This is a terrific weeknight dish because it's so easy.  We made it according to the recipe, except we didn't have paprika or a cast-iron pan.  We used a baking dish instead.  Also, we used braised pork loins/chops.  Very good.  It had just the right amount of "tang" not to be too spicy or too bland.

I must have done something wrong with this recipe.  I think the pork chops needed salt.  I didn't have kechup so I replaced it with tomato paste.  I also had thick boneless chops and they came out a bit dry.  I'm not sure if I'll try this recipe again.  Oh, I also don't have a cast iron skillet so I used an oven crock.  The sauce was good over mashed potatoes!  Maybe I can try it again and add some changes from other reviewers.

This sauce was great! Just the right combo of sweet/tangy and complimented the meat really well. The only substantial change I made was to throw in some diced onions before baking (and I may have added a tad more brown sugar). I also covered with foil for the first half, then flipped the chops and left uncovered for the second half. They came out moist and wonderful. And it was VERY easy. Definitely a keeper!

DELICIOUS! My hubby and I were licking our plates clean lol. I used the recipe for the sauce with 3 center cut pork chops. So easy and quick, yet tastes like you took a lot of time cooking. This will be added to our dinner rotation :)! Thanks for the great recipe!

This was really good. Like other reviewers I too added a few spices to kick it up a little.  I added red pepper, onion powder and some garlic salt. I also upped the amounts of Worcestershire, the brown sugar and vinegar(I used white wine vinegar since that is what I had on hand). I agree with the other reviewer who thought this would be a good sauce over chicken! I would have given this 5 stars if it were not for the additions...but over all very yummy and very easy!

It was not too bad. I did like the sauce, although it didn't initially have enough kick for my taste so I added some ground mustard.  I only used half the meat it called for and it didn't seem like there was enough sauce even at that point.  I cooked it with onions and potatoes and the onions added great flavor.

This is sooo good!  I did the same as others and did not add the water.  I did the brown sugar as 2 tablespoons instead of 2 teaspoons.  Yum Yum!

YUM!  I marinated everything for a couple of hours.  The only changes I made were I doubled the chili powder, which wasn't spicy and added 2 cloves of garlic.  Next time, I'll add red pepper flakes.  Used 2 bone-in chops and baked for about 32 mins, turning once. I don't have a cast iron skillet so I just used a glass baking dish.

This was really good.  I was out of chili powder, so I omitted that, but even without it my husband said it was spicy (he likes spicy things,) so I might cut the pepper in half.  I might even take this recipe and use it on other things, not sure what though.  We really liked this, and even my picky two-year old ate a good helping of it.

My husband made it exactly as the recipe calls for except he used a stone baking dish since we don't have any cast iron.  These were some of the best pork chops I've had.  Came out very tender and the simple bbq ingredients were delicious.  Even my picky son loved them.

This was good but I think it needs a little something that I can't figure out.  I will also reduce the cooking time a little as the chops were a little dry.

Didn't care too much for the bold vinegar taste. I added alot more brown sugar and honey....I also threw in a few peaches and juice.

My husband LOVED these! I didn't make any adjustments to this recipe at all. Served with mashed taters and corn on the cob. Will definately put in my little book.

They were good, but we found the sauce to be a bit too spicy/hot for us, it over powered the meat. The meat did not turn out as juicy and tender as other reviewers said theirs did. If I make them again I will cut back on the chili powder a bit.

I used 3/4" boneless chops and baked them for 30 minutes; they were delicious.  The sauce is great.
