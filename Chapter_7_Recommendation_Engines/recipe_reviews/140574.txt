I registered just so i could comment this recipes name. I grew up on "Hoe cake".We used bisquick mixed with water until the consistency is like a thick pancake.Put it in a hot oiled cast iron skillet,cooked both sides and served with butter and syrup like a thick pancake. This has been a hit with everyone I have ever made it for.I saw your name and just laughed,it brought back so many memories."Hoe Cake"..haha

This is something I have never tried before.  This recipe tastes like a flatbread, but a little more dense. I think it would be good dipped in marinara.  Sorry, I'm not southern!  It cooked for a little over 20 minutes and I had to add extra milk because the batter was too thick.  I used the bacon grease instead of shortening.  Quick and Easy bread to serve as a side.  Would probably work well cooking over a fire for a campout.

This was so delicious!  I am a yankee who married a southern man and had my first "hoe-cake" last night when I went out to eat with my in-laws and husband and son.  My husband begged for me to try to make it today.  This recipe was WAY better than what we ate last night!  Amazing!

Tastes good but has several problems that can be easily fixed. The recipe doesn't say what size pan to use but I found out the a 10 inch one worked wonderful. One cup of milk in the batter is WAY to little to make a thick but still runny batter. I had to add at least 1/2 cup extra if not more. Finally, if your going to serve this with apple butter or any kind of fruit topping for that matter don't use the garlic salt, I'm sure you can understand why.
The end product I think is worth doing the extra problem solving because it's actually a surprisingly good bread considering it's simplicity. It's a really crust bread that I feel when sliced thin can be enjoyed with many soups.

When I don't want to heat the house by turning on the oven I leave out the garlic salt and use either butter or bacon grease and pan fry  the bread into what looks like hoe cake pancakes My 2 1/2 year old doesn't talk much  or eat much but he makes it very clear when he wants mommies special bread. This was so good.

This is a great tasting recipe!  I have a 9 inch pan and it rises during baking 3/4's to the pan top so it is not a thin bread as depicted in the picture though it is still good!  I would love to know if everyone else has made their's thinner.  It is a great snack!

Sprinkled the pan and the top of the hoe cake with a little bit of sugar rather than garlic, thinking there'd be leftover for toast / breakfast . . . there wasn't a crumb left. Delicious!

Loved this bread. I baked it in a 9" pan and it rose to the top of the pan and cooked great in this size skillet. I didn't use garlic salt just used table salt in case someone wanted to spread it with jam. I'm sure it would be great with garlic salt too. Thanks for the recipe I will make this again.

Bacon fat subbed for shortening. Add more milk if batter is too thick. May require a little over 20 minutes. Delicious. VARIATION: For sweet rather than savoury, omit the garlic and serve with jam.

I had to use spreadable butter instead of shortening; cut the recipe in half; and use gluten free baking mix or some call it rice flour. I am gluten intolerant and the only one in the family with it. It doesn't raise as much but is wonderful and also good with strawberry butter also. Very delicious!

Great tasting bread that reminds me of my childhood and the great, inexpensive dishes my Mother made. Easy and really good!
