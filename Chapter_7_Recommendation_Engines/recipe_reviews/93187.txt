I changed this up a bit..I fried up some hamburger with taco seasoning and mixed that with salsa and shredded cheese.  I baked the cresent cups for half of the time, then added my hamburg mixture and finished baking...YUM!

Just made these for appetizers for the new years party and they did not last very long. I mixed a can of chopped green chili with refried beans and toped with shredded cheese and black olives. I folded the tops of the crescent rolls over when I baked them and they turned out great. Might use seasoned ground beef next time to add some more flavor. Will definantly use again :)

These were a big hit!  Topped with homemade guacamole.
