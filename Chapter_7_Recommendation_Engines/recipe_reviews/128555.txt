My family has made/eaten kugel for years.  All of them hands down said it was the best they have ever had and asked for the recipe.  I recommend you make the following 2 modifications: I used 3 eggs instead of 2.  Secondly, I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese. If you use the recipe you can't go wrong!

My children love this sweet noodle kugel! I gave it only 4 stars because I made a bunch of changes - to make it a healthier dinner - I omitted the sour cream and butter, and i left out the raisins (my kids don't like them). I added a third egg to ensure the mixture will hold together - very sweet and delicious! UPDATE: I made this for PASSOVER by substituting matzo farfel for the noodles! I used 1 package of farfel, soaked it in warm water for about i minute, drained it, and then continued using the other healthier substitutions mentioned above.

I misplaced my families favorite Kugel recipe that I have been making for years so I reluctanly tried this recipe. My family loved it and it has now become the new family kugel recipe for the holidays. The only change I made was to use 4 cups of sour cream instead of the cottage cheese and an extra egg. It made it fluffier and lighter.

I made this for Rosh Hashana dinner (also made a parve version) and it was delish! Left out the raisins as my husband doesn't like them but other than that, stuck to the recipe.  Guests loved it, I loved it!

This was really easy and great tasting.  I used prunes instead of raisins, and I think next time I will add 2 more eggs, and use half the butter.

This recipe is easy to make.  Since some reviewers said it is a bit bland, I added 1 tsp vanilla and 2 Granny Smith apples, peeled and chopped, along with the raisins in the recipe.  I also uses 4 eggs instead of just two, for binding reasons.  It was a hit!  I will make it again.

This was pretty good, as noodle puddings (kugels) go. I find most of them bland, and this was no exception, but it was pleasantly creamy. Instead of butter I just used a good spritz of PAM.

This was such a hit I need to double or triple the recipe next time. 

Used apricots because I didn't have raisins. Pot style cottage cheese because it's more authentic. Mixed cinnamon and butter into mix. Used half the sugar.

Amazing! I made this for someone who never tasted noodle pudding.  WOW!
 I listened to another person who reviewed this recipe and added a 3rd egg. Note sure if it changed anything.  Yum Yum Yum!
