Good restaurant-style salsa.  Can be easily adjusted to suit different tastes.  Add or reduce the amounts of just about everything, but the tomatoes.

Loved it! I followed other reviewers and used one can tomato sauce and one can diced tomatoes for a chunkier salsa. It was phenomenal!

This a great salsa recipe!! Almost identical to our favorite local mexican restaurant's salsa, which they serve in a squirt bottle. Great stuff!! I didn't change anything, made exactly as recipe.

This was good but hot! I made a half batch with minor changes- homemade sauce, 2 jalapenos(because I had no serranos) and the hard to measure amounts of cilantro and lime juice. Cilantro ended up being the predominant flavor and then just followed by the heat.  I will make this again but try to quantify the amounts since my reason for making this is to try to find a recipe that I could make consistently.

very easy to make.  I used one can sauce, and one can diced tomatoes.  I omitted the serrano pepper as I didn't have one on hand.  Somehow, the onion that I used was SUPER strong, so now that the flavors have mingled overnight I will add additional lime juice to tone down the overpowering onion.  I usually make Pico de Gallo, but was looking for more of a Taqueria-type salsa for a dish I was making.  This fits the bill.  This type of salsa is sometimes referred to as 'Ranchero' salsa.  Thanks, Toe!

The salsa could be good without the cilantro...added cilantro and now I have just a huge mess of red and green to clean up.  I suggest making this without the cilantro and if you want add a very, very, very, very small amount of it.

Made half the recipe. This didn't have enough acid for me, so after blending I added 1 tbs lime juice. Sadly, I had to cut out all but 1 jalape√±o, and that was small, because my mom can't take any heat. But the flavors were good, and this is one of those really good base recipes. I later decided I wanted a chunky salsa so added one large fresh diced tomato. On tasting it with my chips, it needed salt, so threw in a pinch. I've been making salsa crude for years and with the added tomato, lime and salt, this is exactly what I was looking for in restaurant table salsa. Thanks!

Love it! I've made this recipe several times now. Got rave reviews from guests. I LOVE it! Except that I truly can only handle mild spiciness. "Medium" pace salsa is a bit much for me. SO, I just don't use the serranos. Even "de-veining" as suggested in the notes doesn't make it a mild salsa. So I omit the serranos all together. It still tastes WONDERFUL!! THANK YOU THANK YOU! I'm going to learn how to jar this so that I can just have it whenever I want! :) It's way better tasting to me than anything I can get from the store.

Excellent, quick, and 100% tastes fresh - even with canned tomatoes. The baseline ingredients are always on hand, witht the exception of the sorrento pepper - which i omit.  My slight modifications are to use petite diced tomatoes, add 1 tsp of cumin, and coarse sea salt.

It was really liquidy and I didnt realize it made so much, but it tasted pretty good.
