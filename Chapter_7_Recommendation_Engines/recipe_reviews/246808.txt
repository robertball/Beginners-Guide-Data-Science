Made as written except that I used regular limes because I have never heard of or seen kasturi limes. I really liked this. I didn't know what to expect from the shrimp paste but it was good in this and I ended up adding even more. I made it to dip potstickers in but it would be great on many different things. Thanks for sharing!
