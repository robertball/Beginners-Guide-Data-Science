I made this for Thanksgiving dinner, and my family loved it. I used chicken broth instead of turkey broth, and I sauteed the onion in butter/oil along with a couple ribs of celery. I added 1 teaspoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, but I probably could have skipped the added salt because the oysters were salty enough. I'm sure I'll make this again. It was very easy to make, and there wasn't a lot left over, which is always a good sign.

Great flavors in this one!  I switched out the beef with bison to reduce the fat and used hot sausage and red pepper to kick it up a bit.  I also added shitake mushrooms.  Need to remove the foil early to brown the top.

While I don't like oyster dressing, my husband was craving one of his childhood Thanksgiving favorites. His grandmother would make oyster dressing every year. I knew completely nada about it beyond I'd never made it because I didn't like it. I chose this recipe because it looked easy enough to make and it had good reviews. I made a few changes, but they were omissions, not additions (meats). To my delight (and my husband's), this is EXACTLY like his grandmother used to make! He even forewent a lot of other side dishes to eat more of this. A keeper and I thank you!!

I found this recipe and started making this about 3 years ago and it is now a requested favorite.  I use chicken broth instead of turkey broth (mostly because I usually have chicken broth), I usually x1.5 the oysters (upon request), and started using suggestion to saute onions beforehand, but the first time I made it exactly like the recipe calls for and it works perfectly too.

I added 1/2 teaspoon poultry seasoning, 1 pint fresh oysters, 3/4 tsp oregano, 1/4 tsp clove, and 1/4 cup good red wine to this already great recipe. ENJOY
