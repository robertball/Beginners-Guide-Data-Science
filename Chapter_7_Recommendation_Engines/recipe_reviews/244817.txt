2-21-2106  ~This was different and pleasant enough but nothing I’d make a point to make again.  First, the positive – the curry offered just a hint of its flavor and a pleasant touch of sweetness.  The shrimp, too, was a creative touch, but I’m glad I used raw shrimp rather than cooked, which contributed its flavor to the broth as it cooked.  The minced garlic I added along with the onion and leeks helped in the flavor department too.  I did use half-and-half rather than milk and was glad for it as the soup was still a little too thin. And I think there was too much butter too – I found I preferred to skim some of it off the top of the soup before I served it, so half the amount would have been plenty. But here’s my single, biggest criticism – I should have trusted my instincts when I saw the relatively small amount of leeks in the recipe for this LEEK and Potato Soup with Shrimp.  I went ahead and followed the recipe as directed, but found that the taste of leeks was just barely noticeable and could easily have been doubled.

Simple, delicious...I did what some others suggested and switched out the milk for half-n-half which helped add a richness to the broth.  I also used fresh Argentina Red shrimps that really enhanced the broth.  I did not continue to simmer after I mixed in the cream and shrimp.  The temp is so high at that point all you need to do is mix in these last two ingredients and let is set for about 15 minutes or so...this cooks the shrimp without overcooking it, gives the flavors a chance to blend and cools the soup just enough to where it can be served and consumed immediately.

Overall great concept.  I was about to resort to heavy cream because we ran out of milk, but feared it would be to thick.  And while I was musing over replacements I thought about coconut milk.  So, I added a half cup coconut milk and a half cup heavy cream.  By the time I finished the soup, I'd used about a full cup of coconut milk, a half cup of heavy cream, and an extra teaspoon of curry.  Absolutely delicious. :)

Delicious! I used half milk and half cream for a bit of added richness. Other than that, I made it exactly as written. So comforting on a chilly day.

It was absolutely delicious. Loved it. The only change I made was that I added raw shrimp instead of cooked shrimp pretty well near the end of the recipe. Shared it with several of my family, and they all loved it as well. Will definitely make it again. It is very easy, simple and delicious.

My new favorite soup!  I used Better than Boullion and water instead of the broth. I find it to be more flavorful than carton broth. I also added a garlic clove with the leeks.  Red potatoes work the best in soups as they don't turn to mush. If you leave the skins on you get some red color in the soup, which is nice.

VERY good recipe.  Thanks Diana!  The only thing I did differently is substitute the russets for yukon gold potatoes, which I like better.  Also, used only about half the curry powder.  Very yummy recipe.

I added a little celery and carrot also. Mostly after blending the spuds/onions/leeks. Russets are best for a thickened blended soup, reds if you want them more intact. Yukon Golds are in between in waxy/mealy status. I like a little heat and one can't go wrong w/ a Chef John mantra "...cayenne pepper..." in a pinch. Recipe calls for cooked shrimp...WRONG, it's raw shrimp that gets cooked at the end.

This soup was incredible.  We have a family member who doesn't like bacon, so the shrimp more than makes up for not using bacon in a standard potato leek soup.  The curry is a subtle addition.  I went light on the curry and blended up 1 cup of the soup to make it more full-bodied.  I also added some cornstarch in water to make the final soup thicker.

I found this soup to be very good. I did make a few changes to it. Instead of using leeks and onion, I used 4 leeks instead. After letting the leeks and potatoes simmer for 20 minutes I took about a cup of the soup out and used an immersion blender on the rest and then added the cup back in. This gave me more creaminess without the added fat of cream. I also added fresh corn kernels from two cobs of corn when I added the milk and I let my defrosted shrimp cook in the soup instead of cooking them ahead of time. Finally, my soup needed a little more depth so I added two Knorr vegetable soup bouillon cubes to the pot. Delicious with some crusty bread.

Love this for easiness and taste. Did and a bit of bell pepper to increase the vegetables. Used cream to add to the creaminess. Definitely plan to add to my meal rotation.

I made it several times and it is awesome.
Last time I substituted sweet potatoes and it may well have been the best one! (Used half and half for extra richness)

Rather not have it with shrimp in it - they became rubbery.   Also a little thin needs a thickener more than just the potatoes.   But still good

Excellent flavor. After blending the soup up a bit, I didn't think it needed any cream, which makes it easier to freeze portions for future lunch and dinners.

Added one minced scotch bonnet pepper without seeds for some heat. Nothing goes better with curry than scotch bonnet. Also added some minced carrots. Used half and half like other reviewers mentioned. Didn't have shrimp ready and substituted with some leftover chicken.

Made a few minor changes (of course) but basically followed the recipe.  Used red potatoes, half & half instead of milk, cut the curry in half and used 12 oz. of shrimp instead of 1 lb. as that was what was available.  Overall pretty decent. We were not blown away, but will make it again.  I believe that with the addition of a few more ingredients (fish, oysters, scallops, bacon etc.) it could be an excellent chowder. Thanks!

Used an extra leak and an extra potato. Omitted the shrimp.  Substituted 1/2 cup skim milk & 1/2 cup fat free half and half for the milk.  Blended it a bit in the pot when cooked- this made it extra creamy. Topped with bacon bits.  Delicious!  Might try adding some corn next time.

WARNING: The broth can be very salty, the shrimp can even be very salty (As my pkg was) and the Almond milk that  used has added salt. So..... I should have tasted as I went and reduced the added salt hat I put in with the pepper, but ended up adding pure cream and little extra almond milk  and more curry. Pretty yummy. My boy returned from 3 day ski trip just as the soup was finishing up on the stove, so perfect timing. This recipe takes very little time to make and is worth it ! (I noticed in video that she must have been adding uncooked shrimp based on her comment but the recipe calls for cooked)

I actually made this all in the slow cooker. Let the leeks and onion marinate in salted butter on high until it came to a boil; then proceeded with the steps as written, substituting cashew milk for actual milk because of an allergy. I don't think these small tweaks took away from the recipe one bit. THIS WAS DELICIOUS!! Definitely going into my fall soup arsenal!

Instead of broth, I made this with water and chicken bouillon, adding extra bouillon to taste instead of salt.  The curry is just the right amount, the flavor is subtle.   I substituted half and half for  milk. It's delicious.  I'll make it again and again.

Fantastic!   This was my first time using leeks (I know, I'm sheltered) and they were used perfectly in this dish.   I used heavy cream in place of the milk and used uncooked shrimp instead of cooked.   Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.   I will definitely be making again.

This soup was a snap to make, uses few ingredients and was scruptuous. I added a teaspoon of Tumeric which gave added a richness to the flavour.  I'll defiantly be making it again.

It's tasty. I was looking for a protein to go with the standard version of this on the side, but I love the shrimp in this.
