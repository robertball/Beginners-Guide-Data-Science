mmmm so good.  I did add a bit of my own touch to this.  I added 4 cloves of garlic with the peppers while they boiled.  I also left all the seeds in while boiling.  Then I added a handful of cilantro as well as the juice from 1 lime.  It turned out very spicy and extremely flavorful.

If you are looking for a mild hot sauce this is great! Very tasty, big hit! Next year I will try with hotter peppers for other members of the family who thought this was too mild (I don't eat hot stuff too much so I thought it was quite spicy ;)This recipe was indeed easy,I am very much a novice at cooking anything and am learning a lot by mistakes very quickly ;) I think this recipe should come with a warning for people like me who don't know anything about cooking: When you boil those peppers open the windows turn the fan on and stand away from the stove (I choked everyone out of the kitchen with the capsacin-loaded steam that came from the pot), Also--I do know you should wear gloves when working with hot peppers but I threw caution to the wind in that respect--I thought I had washed it all off (washed many many times) but I ended up burning my eyes when I got up in the morning! and my fingertips started burning again each timeI washed my hands. Rub aloe vera on fingers thoroughly then wash off the goopy stuff, repeat if necessary (it took two times for me but then the burning was completely gone)

The minute I read this recipe, I knew it would be one FIERY HOT sauce so I made a few adjustments. I used only one small jalapeno pepper for the entire recipe and added one clove of garlic along with 2 tbsp each of canola and reserved water, but the sauce was too HOT! I continued to add 2 tbsp each of canola oil and boiled water to the blender until I reached a level that was comfortable for my family (about 8 tbsp each). Finally, I seasoned the sauce with a pinch of salt. The flavor was absolutely delicious!! I've made this several times and used it as a sauce for chile rellenos, quesadillas, tortilla chips, chicken enchiladas...the list goes on. My family loves it!!

This recipe is delicious as it is and easy too.  But if you roast a few of the peppers, over your gas burner is fine (do not peel) and add them to the mix you will have Super Taqueria perfection.

I was so suprised how good this was.  I tuned it down a bit by only adding half of the fresh pepper, it was enough kick to enjoy! Be careful when cutting the Jalapenos, you can smell the heat. So good, it's a must try!!!

I'd originally given this 4 stars, but I need to make it 2.  Waaaay too much work!  We love Mexican food, but, for the life of me, I couldn't figure out what to do with this once it was made.  We added 2t to a big pot of chili, but the remainder got moldy in the fridge.

Great salsa!  This is a little chunkier than the Jalapeno Hot Sauce on this site because of the raw jalapeno thrown in the blender, but I like it just as much.  It's more like the green salsa that is sold in the little mexican markets but without the tomatillos.  I only seeded half the jalapenos because we like ours pretty spicy.  It's a great mix-in for guacamole!

I love this sauce! I get it at Cha Cha Cha in Portland all the time and have been searching for the recipe. I am glad it is so easy! I left all of the seeds and membranes in, and used olive oil instead of canola and it turned out perfectly! You feel like a maniac when you are cutting up all those jalapenos, but it is well worth it!

This Jalapeno Sauce was a huge hit with my family! I made it when i was working on some burritos for lunch. Recipe is simple and its super easy to make. I also added about 5 pieces of Bird's Eye Chilli (red, tiny, very very intensely hot) to give it that extra ZZZING to the sauce. We are chilli people so we liked it very spicy. I also added a tablespoon of sour cream to the mixture for a little sour kick. Mixture became even creamier. Had a whole lot of fun making this. Delicious :)  CAUTION: When you de-seed the jalapenos, please use a glove or something. I ran out of gloves and used my bare hands - BIG MISTAKE as it was red and burning for the entire day!

Could not believe how delicious and easy this was. I have been putting this on everything for the past two days. I am going to try this with pesto as a pasta sauce soon.

My husband enjoys hot flavors, but still wants to be able to taste the item, not just the heat.  He says this one does just that.  Has an excellent jalapeno flavor.  
I did adjust the recipe just a bit.  I kept 2 whole jalapenos; stemmed & seeded the rest.  Boiled 1/2 of those & roasted the other 1/2.  Then combined everything into the blender.
I really thought this would have more of a hot sauce consistency, it does not.  It has a "dip" consistency.  Taste is excellent, but not hot.  I have to assume that is because of my jalapenos...not a HOT batch, I guess.

Yes, so I modified this as well. Used only 5 peppers, 1/2 of one held back. Then after boiling the peppers, added a couple of cloves of garlic and 1/4 cup cilantro. After blending, folded in about 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese (a la pesto). Makes an incredible sauce for any Thai dish, noodle dish, or just on fresh veggies!

Tried this today, wow, mine definitely has a lot of heat!  My peppers were obviously hot. (Usually my peppers are not that hot).   Followed the recipe, but added garlic cloves.  After blending, I added sour cream, juice of a lime,  and some cilantro which calmed the heat a bit.   Very tasty with a nice afterburn.   Will make this again,  but may use a combo of milder peppers  to tone it down.

makes for a great sauce. All it adds to any dish I top it on is a lot of heat and a little Jalapeno/water flavor. Much different then the store bought sauces I usually put on things. They cover the dishes flavor with their own. This sauce just added to the dish.

I forgot to leave the fresh pepper for the blending. I left in all the seeds. Added no salt or pepper. Used olive oil instead of canola.

Pretty certain I will be making this again.

Like previous cooks, I added garlic and a minced onion, and left half the seeds.  Not hot enough or flavorful for me (but still really good). I added lime juice and cilantro and puréed with the immersion blender. Very tasty but still not very spicy, so I gave it a good squirt of hot chili oil.  Ta Da!!  Great flavor and then has some heat on the back end.  Probably won't be bad as a stand alone salsa but I'm going to make enchiladas verde with it.

I really liked this hot sauce.  I boiled it outside on the grill so that I could avoid having capsaicin floating all over my kitchen, plus it was over 100 outside, so I didnt' want to heat up the house.  I transferred the boiled peppers and some of the remaining water to a 2 cup pyrex measuring glass. I added EVOO and salt and used my emulsion blender which worked very nicely to blend it smooth.  Thanks for posting this recipe!

Cut the recipe to 25 servings. Otherwise no alterations. Jalapeños were a combination of green and red. Jalapeños aren’t supposed to be terribly hot, but you never know. This turned out quite hot for Jalapeños, but still within the safety range for all but the faint of heart.

Hot but no real flavour.  I'll stick with my Frank's.   Cooking the peppers cleared out the nasal passages of everyone within a two kilometre radius.

Salt & Pepper to taste!HA HA HA. Added salt, took a taste and couldn't taste anything for a half hour. Very fresh tasting. Great mixed with sour cream for Tex-Mex food.

This a great way for me to use all the extra chillies in my garden. Very tasty and spicy! :)
