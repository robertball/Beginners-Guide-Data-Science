Really GOOD!  I scaled the recipe to 2 servings because I had 1 lb. of chuck roast to play with.  Instead of salsa, I added a 5 oz. can of El Pato (yellow can) because we like spicy.  I also added the full can of green chilis, drained.  Because it was only 1 lb. of meat, I shredded it right in the crockpot  (after 8 hrs) and turned it to high heat for about two hours with the lid off.   It made the most delicious carnitas!  This is a definite keeper and next time I will make the full recipe and freeze in serving sizes for two, for a quick, easy meal.  Thank you for sharing!

Have made it for guests twice and both times it was a hit. Served with Mexican rice, cornbread, black bean and corn salad. Key lime pie for dessert provided a cool end to the delicious spicey beef dish . It is great as left overs.

I was surprised with this one.  It was very tender meat.  We ate it with rice for one meal and then froze the rest.  We shredded it and used it as a burrito filler for a 2nd meal.  Both meals were amazing!
