This is the best and easiest recipe I've seen for pizza crust. Just remember to make sure you have flour before you start the yeast in water. If you have kids, you might want to cut down on the oregano.

This recipe is perfect. The crust always turns out like the Pizza places back home in New York. I make this every time I want Pizza. Best of all you get enough dough for three sheet pans. It freezes great. Just be sure to coat with olive oil before proofing in the fridge. Otherwise it will stick to the back.

This was good, but I think next time I'll use vegetable oil in place of the olive oil. But a good crust. I pre-baked and I liked the texture.

This pizza crust was great!!!  We didn't want to make all the crusts at once, so we made one and froze the rest of the dough to use later.  We froze it in balls and then rolled it out after it was thawed, and it worked good.  Thanks for a really good recipe!

This recipe was delicious, even though I overlooked and therefore did not add the margarine (I used some canola oil during the kneading, which probably helped add the necessary fat to the crust).  I baked the pizzas on a preheated stone (no pre-bake) with my oven on its highest setting (broil) and topped the pizza with blended Muir Glen tomatoes (pinch of salt, pinch of sugar, pinch of oregano), fresh mozzarella, peccorino romano, fresh basil, and a little black pepper.  The pizzas were absolutely divine, with crusts that were thin and perfectly crisp beneath the toppings and thick and bubbly along the edge.  I highly recommend this crust!

We are on our 2nd half batch of this crust. I get 4 12in crust out of half a recipe. I roll out the crusts onto the pans, cover with plastic wrap and tin foil and then freeze. When we want pizza we just grab one out and put the toppings on and stick it in the oven! Halfway through cooking time I do slide the pizza off the pan and right on to the oven rack because we like a crispy curst. The crust is great and smells like pizza heaven.  At first when I read the directions I thought... I don't want to put it in the fridge to rise! Then I watched a Good Eats with Alton Brown and he said the best way to let a pizza crust rise in slowly in the fridge. My dough still tripled in size in just a few short hours in the fridge!

Perfect crust and really easy. Use the sauce recipe that follows with this crust and you will never order out pizza again. We make enough sauce and crusts for about 10 pizzas then freeze them in serving sizes. Shred enough motz for all those pizzas and freeze in serving sizes and you can make delicious pizza to your liking more quickly than they can deliver it!

I am a serious pizza lover and this is the best crust recipe I have ever had, I will search no more.  I cut the recipe to 10 servings which made one deep dish pizza.  I doubled the oregano, garlic, and salt.  Also a trick I learned from a friend who worked at a pizzaria is to brush the dough with oil before you put it in the fridge, not the healthiest but yummy and looks nice and browned.  Thank you for this amazing recipe!

This is a great recipe.  I tried it yesterday, as I was making 3 pizzas.  It went together well and tasted good. My family liked it.  I did not put it in the refrigerator, but let it rise and then used it.

I've been looking for a good pizza dough recipe for years and I finally found it.  This was a quick and easy recipe that makes lots of dough--and it tastes really good too.  I froze several to make a quick meal when I'm in a hurry.

I made this using a 20% wheat flour mix (4 cups white flour mixed with 1 cup whole wheat) that I subtitute in most of my recipes calling for plain white flour. It was the best pizza crust recipe I have found and I have tried many. I made a huge batch and froze some and it was just as good as the day I made it.

This was relatively easy and oh so good.  It freezes well, but I would suggest cutting the recipe in half for a first try.  It is a lot of work to play with such a big dough ball.  
I replaced the margarine with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and also sprayed with PAM to avoid stickage to the bowl(for rising)/plastic wrap (for freezing).  

I made an artichoke/olive/tomato/onion/fresh mozzerella pizza and an spicy italian sausage/roasted red pepper (from jar)/fresh mozz/onion pizza.  Both with fresh roasted garlic tomato sauce.  Major crowd-pleaser.
THANKS!

This dough is great. I did notice that it doesnt seem to need 11 cups of flour but maybe more towards 10 for me and I did use 2 cups of whole wheat flour. It adds a nice taste and color to the crust. All my friends asked about it and were quite surprised that it was home made and enjoyed it very much. The flavor is good but I think a little more wouldnt hurt. I rolled the excess into balls, sprinkled with flour and wrapped in saran wrap and froze them. I defrosted over night a few days later and it seemed to work just as good as fresh.

i found this to be a good pizza crust. I however found that I did not need as much flour as called, and with a 2/3rds recipe amount only got 2 crusts. It tastes amazing, although I will be trying putting more seasonings into the dough next time

This is definitely my favourite pizza crust.  I've made it at least 3 times, and it's turned out perfectly every time.  You can really play with the spices that go into the dough...I've used combinations of thyme, basil, oregano, and even popcorn seasoning for an interesting variation.

I love this recipe, Iv always made the plain crust recipes with no seasoning so this one was sooo yummy.  I loved the tastes of the garlic and oregano, I think next time Ill try doubling the seasoning as someone else had suggested.  The only things I did differently was, I didnt add sugar (cooking for a diabetic) and I didnt refrigerate mine and just covered it with a cloth and let rise.  Turned out great!!!  Love it!  Thank you so much!

This crust was delicious!  I did make it exactly as the recipe stated.  I did not have as much crust as some of the other reviewers.  I made one 18 incher and two 15 inchers and used half of the dough.  Will DEFINITELY make this again!  I also used the homemade sauce recipe from this site and it was delish!!  Put my pizza loving family in pizza comas!!

This is the best pizza crust I've made yet. Everyone just raved about the taste. I basted the edge of the crust with garlic butter before going in the oven and it added a real nice added flavor and appearance. Only used about 9-10 cups of flour and proofed the dough at 100 degrees for an hour. This recipe is a keeper! Thanks for sharing.

this was great, I let it rise under a towel at room temp, took about 1-1/2 hr. Great pizza..I parbaked the crusts as well. Made one thicker and two thin (and some bread sticks) from one batch. The thin turned out crispy,the thick soft, but so flavorful from the garlic powder. I omitted the Oregano

My first time making homemade dough.  So glad I tried this, and that there was plenty left over to freeze for another time.  Followed the recipe exactly, except I let it raise in a warm oven with a towel over the top instead of in the fridge. Outstanding!

I am an "experimenter" in the kitchen, usually modifying the recipes with my materials on hand.. This turned out great. I didn't have any corn meal or hard cheeses or dried garlic. I cut the recipe in half, substituted a cup of whole wheat for a cup of white. Also, I don't HAVE AN OVEN. I do have a turbo counter top "oven" that I preheated to max. I punched down the dough and rose it the second time, cut a third off and started rolling. after about 10 seconds, I just picked it up and starting tossing it like a pro. This is the first time I ever made pizza mind you. I got a nice 12-13" round, dropped it onto the counter and brushed it w/ OO. Then, put it on a tin foil wrapped paper plate!! topped it, and tossed it in. In about 15 minutes, it was the best looking pizza I have seen . (proud like a new father). The bottom was as soft as a babies butt, so I just grabbed a heavy fry pan, greased it and got it real hot, slid the pie onto it and finished it off in about 5 minutes. The result? the best pizza me or my GF has ever had. OUTSTANDIN' RECIPE, thanks.

I would have given this recipe 5 stars BUT it doesn't state an estimated time on how long you have to wait for this dough in the fridge to expand in size soooo therefore my dinner was late to say the least. I finally couldn't wait for the fridge and set it on top of my oven while it was preheating with a damp cloth covering the bowl so that it would finish rising. All in all very good pizza crust. Crispy on the bottom and soft as well. Good flavor too. Will make again but with the knowledge of how long it takes to rise.

This is the best tasting pizza dough I've tried. I gave 4 starts because it took less flour than the recipe called for. You will probably need to adjust it too. Otherwise, this is the perfect pizza dough and freezes perfectly!!!

Every one in my (picky eating) family loved this! My husband even said he would rather eat this than pizza from a restaurant.  I followed the directions exactly. There was a good bit left over so I shaped it into some small crusts to have on hand for a quick lunch.

Everytime I make this crust, my family eats the pizza so fast that its gone in five minutes. Its so versatile, and works really well as thin and thick crust. My family really liked the thick crust. Thanks for a great dinner =)

Made this a few times now, its been great everytime.  I use have wheat flour and use oil instead of margarine and also precook the crust fro about 5 minutes before adding toppings!

I had a hard time with this recipe, but it was my first time making a pizza crust that you don't just add water to. It never tripled in size. How long will it take to triple in size in the fridge? I left it in for 2 hours nothing has happened. The taste was very good, but the texture wasn't. This was not what I was expecting with all the great reviews.

I really enjoyed this recipe!  I used my bread machine for mixing and rising.  Also added basil and rosemary.  I forgot to brush the crust with olive oil before baking.  I think it would have been even better had I remembered.

Very good crust, the best ever, did not add sugar to it as I didn’t think it needed it.My sister in law just loved it as the rest of my family. I also did not let it rise until double in bulk as it turned out wonderful. I will give it 5 stars.

I rolled out over 10 pizza crusts, which I froze (~12"), and I cooked 2 pizzas immediately. I don't think that the dough rose enough for my liking, but I think I'll be able to get around that by just letting it rise for a few minutes before baking-- next time.

The pizza was really good, even though it was kinda flat. The fact that I have so many pizza crusts on hand makes this a 5-star recipe.

I have a freezer full of fancy crusts, usable whenever!!  I'm so happy. I look forward to making this again in the future.

Great dough and very flexible.  This recipe makes 4 good sized crusts.  We had a make-your-own pizza Christmas party and it was a huge hit.  Thanks for the recipe - this is now my go-to dough recipe.

I just made this dough and if it tastes half as good as it smells, it will be amazing!  My whole kitchen smells like oregano!  Very easy recipe to make by hand.  Does make a LOT of dough.  Kneed half of it at a time.

Perfect crust.  I par bake before adding toppings. Always have a crispy crust all the way through.  I get many compliments on this pizza crust.

I've tried every pizza dough recipe under the sun. This recipe is the only one i have made more than once! this quickly became my go to pizza dough recipe! Fluffy and crispy and not dense. Delicious with the garlic and oregano!! I usually cut this down so I don't have to freeze it an it adjusts really well! I love it so much!

So, my son decided that we had to have pizzas at his latest birthday.  I found this recipe and used it...Absolutely the best dough ever!! I ended up with a total of 7 crusts and only had 8 pieces left at the end of the party!! My family and I love it so much we have decided to make it weekly and to never order again!!! The recipe is super easy to follow with great results!!!

This recipe makes a LOT of dough.  I loved it though, and so did my husband.  I've been trying a new pizza dough recipe every week and I will be sticking with this one for a while (especially since I have much more in the freezer from one batch) It has a great flavor and rises a lot!  Thanks!

Best I've tried!  Used it with a pizza stone and everyone raved!  Best to knead for the full 10 minutes - I've made it twice and the first time I didn't knead it for long enough.  Was much harder to stretch.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

Made in the bread machine substituting 1T bread machine yeast for the package called for in the recipe.  Cooked individual pizzas on the grill and they were AMAZING!
