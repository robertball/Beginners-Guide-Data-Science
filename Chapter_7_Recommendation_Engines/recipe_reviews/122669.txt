I love this recipe for three reasons: it's VERY easy to prep and make, it's VERY easy to modify if you have different tastes, and it's VERY yummy! 
The first time I made it, I did modify it just slightly, because (1) I like more fruit than topping, and (2) I thought peaches would be better with the yellow cake mix than apple or cherry pie filling. So I mixed together one can of peach pie filling in the size called for by the recipe and one 15-oz. can of "regular" yellow cling peaches in light syrup -- the kind you'd eat right out of the can. Obviously, the addition of the extra peaches lengthened the cooking time; I think it was more like four hours before the cake topping was done. But boy, was it worth the wait! We topped it off with vanilla bean ice cream -- delicious! My husband could not WAIT to finish it off! 
The second time I made it, I used two cans of apple pie filling and a spice cake mix. Again, longer cooking time, but still delicious if a bit oversweet -- without the ice cream, we'd have had to eat much smaller portions because it was so rich. 
The next time I try it, I'm going to use white cake mix and a 25-oz. jar of blackberry pie filling from Cracker Barrel. Or maybe Devil's Food cake and cherries! The possibilities are almost endless with this recipe. 
Anyway, thanks for sharing it! My husband isn't a minister, but we sure love this stuff!

This works well with canned peaches (2 cans) sometimes I add a handful of dried cranberries or any fress berry works too. I don't like to use the nuts on top, instead I mix about 3/4 cup oatmeal with about 2/3 cup brn. sugar and add 2 more tbs. of butter (makes it like a crisp). This also works well in a dutch oven, a family tradition on summer camping trips, with the hand cranked homemade van. ice cream of course.

I used two cans of pie filling, and a whole box of cake mix- which I thought was good amount of topping.  This was a very sweet dish, but it was delicious.  I was worried it may be a mess to clean up, but it actually cleaned up nicely from the crockpot.  I used apple, and it was very good.

There was a little too much topping for us - it would be good to use a smaller size cake mix box.  It was so sweet and rich - we served it with vanilla ice cream which actually cut the sweetness.  I think it would be great with a Jiffy size mix.  And it did take a full 3 hrs on low.

Great recipe!  It was a hit at a crock-pot pot luck that I took it to - I used apple pie filling and yellow cake.  I did follow other reviewers' recommendations and used two cans of pie filling, rather than one, but otherwise stuck to the original recipe.  Delicious and simple to make!

The first time I tried this recipe it was entirely too sweet (peach pie filling and yellow cake mix).  I bought a new crock pot and wanted a quick inexpensive recipe to try so I made it again. All I had in the cabinet was french vanilla cake mix and 2 cans of apple pie filling.  I took the last apple in my fridge and also added it to the filling.  Because the recipe was so sweet last time I wanted to cut out some of the cake mix. As other reviewers suggested I added some oatmeal to the mixture. The only oatmeal I had available was two packets of instant apple and cinnamon oatmeal.  I don't know if it made a difference but it tasted fantastic! This is an easy recipe that you can fit to your taste.

I made this for a church potluck and it was a big hit.  I used peaches and in addition to the walnuts, I topped it off with 3/4 C of oats and 2/3 C of brown sugar per another reviewer's suggestion.  It was unbelieveably easy and so delicious.  Next time, I'm going to try it with apples and spice cake mix

A very good recipe.  I prepared this according to directions.  While it was definitely a great tasting dessert, I should have listened to the other reviewers and doubled the amount of cherry pie filling.  I will make this again and will probably change the walnuts to toasted almonds. Also considering adding coconut to it.

you would figure, you couldn't go wrong with this simple recipe....it was way to goopy, soft, under cooked tasting and was a total disappointment. I followed the recipe exactly as recipe stated and I can't say I'd make this again. I'm sorry.

I make this a lot during the summer when it's too hot to bake but we want something sweet. Only changes I make is I use pecans. I sprinkle the dry cake mix over the pie filling, then add the pecans, then I thinly slice the butter and layer it on top of the dry cake mix. It's always really simple and I serve it with either vanilla bean ice cream or Cool-Whip. This doubles really well for company and you can use any combination of pie filling you want. Even cherry pie filling mixed with a large can of crushed pineapple is really good, too. Think Dump Cake. It's pretty much the same thing, only different cooking method.

This was very easy but really too sweet. Next time I will use one package of Jiffy cake mix or a half package of regular cake mix & half the butter. My husband liked it but less sweet would be better. Overall though this was an easy recipe.

This is the easiest dessert I've ever made!!! And it was delicious! I made it for a family get-together and the crock pot was scraped clean!!!! I used apple pie filling and yellow cake mix.  Other than adding some cinnamon to the cake mix, I followed this recipe exactly. I left the walnuts on the side for people to add if they wanted. And I served it with vanilla ice cream.  I will definitely make this again!  Maybe next time I'll try cherry pie filling with some kind of chocolate cake mix. YUMMMY!

I followed the recipe exactly making the apple version.  No one in my family cared for it.  We did not like the consistency at all, good quality ice cream made it edible, but only just. I never like leaving such a negative review but just can't find anything positive to say about this dessert.

I had never tried something like this and wanted to try it. Used 2 cans of premium quality blackberry pie filling - this proved to be a good choice because it is not as sweet as cherry. 
I added about 3/4 cup of oatmeal to the topping and a little bit more butter.
HOWEVER when it was done the topping didn't look pretty and seemed soggy, so I put it in the regular oven at 350 degrees so it could 'crisp up' and turn golden. VERY GOOD but only gave it 4 stars because I had to finish in the oven for it to be better.

I've made this recipe for years.  I've used cherry, apple, berry and peach pie filling; all turn out great.  Top the warm dessert with ice cream or cool whip and it's so very good (and easy!)

Ugh.... I was so excited to make this tonight when I was expecting company, but after cooking 3 hours it still wasn't done. The cake mix was raw and gooey.  I used two cans of pie filling and one regular box of cake mix and 1/2 cup butter.

I have made this recipe many times--but called it DUMP CAKE..     Try it with pumpkin pie filling and spice cake mix--use pecans.   Apple pie filling is also great with spice cake mix.   I always baked it in the oven......will have to try the crock pot!!!

We call this dump cake. Sometimes I use one can and sometimes two depending on what I have on hand. I like it both ways. I dont eat sweets that much but my family loves loves loves this. It rarely lasts over night. I use pecans or leave them out they actually prefer it made without nuts.

I wanted to LOVE this so bad :( 
I used apple pie filling and carrot cake mix. After 6 hours in my crock pot it was still like soup. So I put it in the oven, which worked but was a bummer to have to bake it at the end. 
Good BUT I dont think I'll make again. I'll have to try out different things. GOOD LUCK!

I love this dessert. It was really easy to make. I used a 3.5 qt slow cooker. It came out great. I'm not sure why some reviewers say theirs came out gooey. Mines never do. Maybe you're adding something extra or doing something differently. Also, you gotta top with vanilla ice cream before serving so that it won't be too sweet.

I made this for an open house yesterday and it was a big hit.  I did do a couple of things differently...I added 2 jars of my own canned apples because I needed to have a larger amount.  I also added carmel bits before I put the cake mix on top.  As some other reviewers noted, I added a couple of packages of instant oatmeal on top before putting the melted butter.  It was delicious.  Thank you so much!!!!

A very sweet and easy dessert.  I followed the recipe as written but I think I should have followed one of the other reviewers advice and used a smaller cake mix like the Jiffy brand they mentioned.  But all in all this is a keeper and the variations on this can be endless.

It's true as another said: You really can do any combo. I used Comstock's Lite Cherry filing (since others said was too sweet) w/pineapple cake mix & enjoyed it. Only trouble, last hour I got impatient as the middle didn't seem to be "done" (hard to tell w/only raw, crumbled cake mix & butter) I turned cooker up to high & the sides turned black! Ironically, it didn't taste burnt just looked strange. Need at least 3 hours, maybe more. Also, the buttery cake crumble didn't seem mixed very well. I am challenged in the kitchen & don't know how to fix this except maybe more mixing. Very tastey though. And easy (given the time). Will consider making again.

The simplicity of this recipe and not having to use the oven was great as I had other courses of the meal cooking in my oven.  I used 1 large can of crushed pineapple mixed with 1 Tbsp. cornstarch and 1/2 cup dark brown sugar instead of any pie filling and used a white cake mix, eliminated the nuts and followed the recipe according to the directions.  I added ground cinnamon and ginger to both the pineapple and cake mix/butter mixtures and we topped it with cool whip when we served it.  It was a different type of dessert but everyone enjoyed it especially hubby :-)

If you have a sweet tooth, this is for you! I added extra walnuts and glad I did because it gave more texture. Cook for at least 4-5 hours. I've made this a few times and if you cook for what the recipe suggests, it will be undercooked and goopy.

I made this tonight to take to a cook off at my sons school.  It brought second place (He was thrilled).  I used 2 cans of blueberry pie filling.  Based off other reviews I added 3/4 cup of oatmeal and 2/3 cup of brown sugar.  I too served it with ice cream.  Thank you so much for the easy yet great recipe.

Delicious and so easy!!  I used two cans of apple pie filling and left out the nuts.  Cooked for 2 hours on low and then topped it with ice cream.  I will definitely make this again.

Used two cans of blueberry filling with a box of lemon cake in an oval crockpot.  Thought it would have had a little bit less gooey. Taste not bad, with that combo, but wont make again.  2 of my 3 desserts loving nephews weren't really impressed.

This 'delightful' dessert was delicious.  I added a sprinkling of brown sugar and cinnamon over top.  The smell while it was cooking was heavenly.  Very easy and very tasty.

This was okay. A decent dessert served with ice cream when time and ingredients are short, but not a stand out for me.

I did change this a lot so I'm not rating this version but the option I tried.  I wanted to see if I could make it like a pineapple upside down cake.  I added 1/2 C of brown sugar and mixed 1/4 C of butter into it and then layered pineapple rings on top.  I poured the dry cake mix over the top, then the remaining butter, the reserved pineapple juice, nuts and some coconut.  It took 3 hours to cook and it was delicious!

This was super easy and super delicious and I will definitely make it again! Since I am a person who prefers things not quite as sweet as many people, the next time I will use a little less of the filling.

This was too sweet for both myself and my husband and we ended up throwing it out.  I am giving it 3 stars though because I think it's a great idea and with some modifications, I think I can create a version much more suited to our tastes.  Next time I'm going to cut the cake mix with some all-purpose flour and use fresh fruit & sugar instead of pie filling, or possibly canned fruit in syrup. The combination of the super sweet cake mix combined with the very sweet pie filling was just too much.

I call this Dump Cake. You can dump it all in a 9x12 pan and bake.  I like using the crock pot.  I also add 1 large can of pineapple, juice and all.

Try this with Raspberry pie filling and you will not be disappointed! Throw on some vanilla ice cream or cool whip and you will LOVE it.  Very easy to make, and it goes together in a snap.

I will use this for a potluck dinner at my church next month.  First, I will try it at home.  It sounds too easy to be true!  I wonder if a sugar substitute could be used in place of real sugar and have the same flavors/textures.  Would anyone know this answer?

This was great and so easy!  Instead of pie filling though, I used a quart of pears I had canned previously.
