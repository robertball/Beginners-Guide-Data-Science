Amazingly Delicious! I will be making it again next weekend. It is like going out to eat at an expensive restaurant! Only one change I will make, there was too much spaghetti for me in relation to the wonderful shrimp scampi topping. I will double the recipe next time for the 1lb of angel hair pasta.

Excellent recipe, family  loved it. I used halved cherry tomatoes, not canned tomatoes, left out the chicken broth and increased the wine.  I would use more shrimp the next time.  Will be doing again.

I did make some changes to accommodating I had in the house. I did not use tomatoes or wine. I sauted onion, chopped fresh mushrooms, garlic and red pepper flakes. Doubled broth and added 1/2 cup milk and some parmesan at the end.
