I have not tried this recipie but this is just a tip for all of those that do not know.  When you have a recipie that calls for coacoa powder and vinigar the vinigar has a chemical reaction with the coacoa podwer and turns somewhat reddish brown.  This is what was used before food color was made.

I had never made red velvet cake before so I just picked this one at random.
I made it for a poker party and brought the rest to work and everybody really liked it!  

If I were to make it again, I probably would cut the cocoa powder.  It seems like it had too much of a chocolate taste (not bad, but just not what I think of when I think of red velvet).  Most recipes usually call for a couple tbsp so this one is a lot more.

this is the cream cheese frosting that I used for the cake:

1/2c. of unsalted butter (softened)
2- 8oz. packs of cream cheese (softened)
3 1/2 cups of powdered sugar
1 tbsp of vanilla extract.

After tweaking, I find that this is the best frosting for me.  Not too sweet... just sweet enough.  enjoy!

This recipe made wonderful little mini cupcakes.  It is a light and fluffy cake; some red velvet cakes are much more dense, but if you prefer a spongier cupcake, this one is for you. I overfilled the cups and many rose too high (although they made yummy muffin tops) - filling your cup half full makes a cake even with the paper edge.

Like another reviewer, I made Janni's Cream Cheese Frosting II.  This red velvet cupcake recipe made 60 mini cupcakes and Janni's frosting covered them all with two cups more to spare.

loved this recipe. I did alter it because i did not have buttermilk. A sub. fo buttermilk is 1 TBSP vinegar {distilled white vinegar},and in the same cup with vinegar pour milk to make a 1 cup: Stir it,Let it stand for about 5 mins. Afterward I only poured half of my milk solution, and half cup whipping cream. TRUST ME when i say it made the cake moist, and firm... LOVED IT!! Keeper! FAMILY AND FRIENDS REALLY LOVED IT!!

Very good.  Everyone loved these.  I made them for my wife's baby shower.  Just a tip: I don't think it will work for anything other than red.  I tried to make them blue, substituting blue food coloring for the red.  The batter turned green as soon as I added the cocoa.  I may have to try these again for St. Patrick's Day.

This southern gal loved this recipe, indeed a smaller bite size version from the Red Velvet Cake. One thing you need to make sure is to room temp the buttermilk and eggs. Other than that top these babies off with cream cheese and they are sure to be a hit.

Don't panic when your batter gets all lumpy after the buttermilk goes in like I did! Persevere, and after the flour is added, the batter will (should!) become smooth. Tastes great and would recommend using Scharffenberger non-processed cocoa. Has a much better taste/smell than regular cocoa, in my opinion.

Simple recipe, good results.

These cupcakes were really good but what made them even better was piping on the White Chocolate Cream Cheese Frosting from Red Velvet Cake IV. So delicious!!!!

Great recipe, but a little heavy on the cocoa powder so I reduced it to just 2 tablespoons. These are fluffy and moist, with a light, tender crumb. I've never made or eaten Red Velvet Cake so I'm not sure what they should taste like, but these were a little lacking in flavor for me. I frosted them with "Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting," also from this site. Nice recipe, I've just learned I'm not a big fan of Red Velvet Cake.

These were fantastic! I brought them to work and my co-workers couldn't get enough. I'll definitely make them again. The cream cheese frosting that I used was a perfect compliment!

This was my first ever red velvet cupcake...and it was great!  I made mini cupcakes, so I scaled my recipe down to 5 servings and ended up with about 16 mini cupcakes.  I also used a food coloring gel instead of liquid, stirring it into the milk until the color was a nice rich red.  The things i changed about this recipe were to use melted margarine instead of butter, only 2T of cocoa, and I had to reduce the baking time to 13-14 min for my mini sized cupcakes.  They turned out beautifully!  I melted 1/4 c of chocolate chips, put in a ziploc bag, cut off a small tip, and squeezed heart shaped designs onto wax paper and then froze.  These made the cutest toppers for valentine's day!!

Reviewed: Jun. 11, 2010 I made these cupcakes with a few additions and changes. I added 1/4 cup of vegetable oil, 1 tbsp of sour cream, 1 extra teaspoon of vanilla extract, and instead of 1/3 cup of cocoa, I used 1/2 cup of cocoa, and if you want a more vibrant red as opposed to a chocolatey red, add 2 ounces of red food coloring. In my opinion, these cupcakes were perfectly moist, deliously flavored, and beautifully red!! A definate must try!!

If yours turned out dry, sub the butter with oil.  Any red velvet cake recipe requires TWO ounces of red food coloring.  You will notice the vibrancy in color.

WOW! Couldn't be more pleased, really! I was very happy with the taste and texture of these - I didn't think I was a fan of red velvet (if you're gonna eat chocolate, eat chocolate, right?!?!) Well, I made basically this recipe--used cake flour and only 2T cocoa. Frosted with 8oz cream cheese 2oz butter 1.5c powdered sugar Pinch of salt & vanilla... **AMAZING**

By far one of the best cupcakes I've ever had! Light, fluffy, not too sweet yet filled with taste. The batter does separate when you add the buttermilk but becomes smooth again after adding flour.  Tip: fold in the dry ingredients instead of using a mixer, this guarantees fluffiness.  Enjoy with cream cheese/butter icing: 1/2 cup of unsalted butter at room temp. 1 package (8 oz.)of cream cheese at room temp. 2.5 cups of icing sugar SIFTED 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract

Awesome!!! SOOO many compliments and I am making them for a wedding in June :)
Instead of an an ounce of red food coloring I did  6-8 drops and 1 drop of blue for a deep brick red!
Thanks for this amazing recipe!!!

Cupcakes taste awesome!!  Only thing I found there was too much cocoa, therefore they were not as red as I thought they would be, from talking to friends, and hearing they're recipes for red velvet cupcakes, it seems there is more cocoa in this recipe than most.  Taste was very good though!!

Turned out wonderfully, moist and spongy to the touch,I followed another reviewers suggestion and used 3 tablespoons of cocoa instead of the amount listed in the recipe and it provides just right amount of chocolate.

These came out great! I also did not have buttermilk so substituted using one tbsp. of white vinegar and app. one cup of milk and it worked perfectly. I did not need to add any cream. Just let the vinegar and milk sit for about 5 minutes after you mix them before adding to mixture.

these are wonderful! If you put the vinegar in on top of the baking soda, it fizzes up and they turn out fluffy and delicious, like trampolines for your fingers!!!! I used gel food coloring, and my cupcakes turned kinda pink on the inside, like steak. i didn't even bother to put icing on them and they were still delicious!!!!!!!! Make these!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Instead of cream cheese frosting, I use the original frosting recipe, which is:  1 cup milk mixed with 3 tablespoons flour and a dash of salt; cook until bubbly and thick; let cool.  Meanwhile, mix 1 cup sugar and 1 cup butter; beat until smooth, approximately 7 minutes; add cooled flour mixture a little at a time, until all is incorporated.  Add 1 tsp. vanilla.  Frost cake or cupcakes as usual.  This recipe makes enough frosting for 36 cupcakes or one regular cake.  Everybody wants this frosting on my red velvet cakes/cupcakes.  Even my picky son-in-law.

I have been using  this cupcake recipe for about two years now, and I absolutely love it! Even people who don't like red velvet cake tell me how good it is. I make the recipe exactly how it is and it comes out perfect every time. I always pair it with a cream cheese frosting and it's great. Many people don't like that it is a "chocolately"  cupcake, but that is what red velvet is. My friends mom is actually ordering a red velvet cake, and so I decided to make this recipe. I just pulled the first batch out of the oven at 25 minutes, and it was perfect! I'm so excited to make many more cupcakes and cakes with this recipe! Definitely one of my favorite recipes.

I use this recipe in a coffee shop and it is a big hit.  Now my family is using the recipe and getting great responses.  I like this red velvet because it is moist and has great flavor.  I had a difficult time finding a recipe that didn't seem a bit on the dry side.  Very good and highly recommended.

This is my first time to bake red velvet cupcake. It was so moist and not so sweet! Just perfect for our taste buds! I followed the other reviewers suggestion to reduce the cocoa to tbsp and added  another oz liquid food color to add vibrancy to the mixture. I also added another tbsp of vanilla. Since I don't have buttermilk on hand I substitute 1cup of milk and a tbsp of white vinegar. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes and voila, instant buttermilk! I will surely use this recipe again!

These were pretty good! The only issue I had was that they were baked for too long (at 20 minutes) and were very dry. I would suggest checking on them at 15 minutes and go from there!

Too salty and a bit crumbly. I used a heart pan for Valentine's Day thinking it would be perfect for Valentine's Day and it looked more like a chocolate cake.

We made this recipe in my culinary class and in my opinion this is the best red velvet cupcake that I've had in a while. The cupcakes were so moist, and it had a "melt in your mouth" sensation. All of this is coming from a person that used to didn't like red velvet cupcakes, but this recipe will make you just fall in love with red velvet cupcakes.

Good cupcakes! Instead of a fluid ounce of food coloring I put in about 2 tbsp. of concentrated paste, which gave me a really nice red.

This recipe require way too much cocoa powder.
The Martha Stewart recipe only requires 1/3 cups versus what this recipe requires. Although my cupcakes taste like 'red velvet' they certainly did not look like red velvet, as the cocoa powder overpowers the red shade. My cupcakes were brown.

These are just about the best cupcakes I've ever made (or even had).  They were just the right density and moisture, especially the same day, but the second day they were really delicious too.    I wanted to make filled cupcakes, so I made a quick ganache.  6 oz bitter-sweet chocolate chips, 2 cups cream (or in my case 1 1/2 cups cream and 1/2 cup buttermilk since I ran out of cream).  melt the chocolate into the cream in a double boiler, then cool in the refrigerator until thick.  Poke a hole with a toothpick and make a cavity inside the cupcake for the ganache, and then pipe it into the cupcakes with a frosting bag.  I then frosted them with the Cream Cheese Frosting II. Sprinkle with a little bit of sea salt, and oh my heavens, they were divine!

This cupcake tastes nothing at all like red velvet cupcakes I have had/made in the past.  I had to put a ton of frostin gon them just to have flavor to eat them.  Also, they were NOT read.. more a dark maroon color.  Very heavy, not a light fluffy cake.  Will not make again.

I followed the directions to a tee and I thought the cupcakes came out great.  I was feeling lazy and used a name brand cream cheese frosting rather than make my own.  My kids loved the finished product and begged for more.  Having just made a red velvet cake a few days ago, though, my wife thought these cupcakes were not red enough, and were a little too chocolatey.  (She's not a huge chocolate fan).  We compared this recipe to a number of other red velevet recipes and did see that most seem to call for less cocoa than did this one, usually anout 1 to to tablespoons at most.  That being said, I actually preferred the taste of the cupcakes to the cake we just had.  Next time, though, I'll probably reduce the amount of cocoa just to end up with a redder tint.

These cupcakes had a lovely light texture and nice flavour.  I didn't have a full bottle of food colouring so the colour suffered a little, but not much.  Used a vanilla cream cheese frosting and these disappeared from the adult table at my daughter's cupcake party!

This recipe is easy and yummy.  I paired it with a butter cream frosting.  I ran out of regular red dye and used gel red dye to finish off the oz.  The gel red dye is more concentrated so the color was a beautiful deep crimson red. Overall I don't think I'll be buying a box of mix with this recipe.  Great job!

First time I have ever made red velvet, so I wasn't too sure what to expect.  Followed the recipe as written and mine turned out more reddish brown than the red I was expecting.  They were very light, moist and tasty though

I have never made a red velvet cake before, b/c I felt that it would not come out as well as the professional  cooks. After taking a chance at making these cupcakes, I received rave reviews and many request to make more. If I can do this anyone can...it was moist and the taste is awesome. I made the giant cupcake with several small cupcakes surrounding it. Iceing it with cream cheese iceing and sprinkly with red sprinkles. My children and grand children love it. Try it you'll like it!

The recipe is easy to follow. The cupcakes turn out somewhat chocolaty and that's what I was looking for. If I am going to put chocolat in something I want to be able to taste it.

After reading nearly all reviews I was very unsure... Well, I made them today as written. 
What can I say, they were light, fluffy, moist enough and "morish"! Thanks for a super recipe (my cup cake liners must be slightly smaller, as I made 36)!

It was an easy recipe to follow, I couldn't wait and ate one without the frosting.  It was ok, not like the bakery, they were good, but nothing to write about.  Perhaps they will be better with the frosting.

I freaked out when I realized my buttermilk was expired! I had to substitute heavy whipping cream. The cupcakes turned out moist and delicious though, don't know how recipe would turn out if I used buttermilk. Awesome recipe though, I would make again!

I like this recipe because it wasn't too sweet. I cut the recipe in half, so that may have affected it. It was good!

For the icing, I may keep trying out the quantities for the ingredients because mine came out a little too watery, I would've liked it to be thicker/stiffer for ease icing the tops!

I followed this recipe with the additions that Shawn suggested and the batter is WONDERFUL! It did come out a dark garnet with the 2oz of coloring so I would try it again with only 1. The additions of veg oil and sour cream were great! This is a keeper!

These were a little on the not-so-sweet side, however, frosting fixes the problem. I only used 1/4 cup of cocoa powder because red velvet isn't supposed to have that much anyway. Overall, I had very great responses. Thanks!

The secret is to beat the butter and sugar till light and fluffy! I decreased the cocoa to 2 TBSP and used 2 TBSP of red food color to get that perfect shade of red. I checked the oven after 18 mins and decided to bake for another 2 mins. I took it out of the cupcake pan right after and let it cool in a separate pan so it won't get overbaked while it cools. Came out very moist with just the perfect shade of red. Frosted with a basic cream cheese frosting. Really good! This recipe needs a frosting though as it can't stand on its own flavor.

Very good cupcakes!  Rates as a 4 for us because the texture was a little 'springy'- a little too 'tough'.  Flavor was great though!  Iced them with "cream cheese II" on this site. (That's a great recipe too!)

This is the first time I've tried making red velvet cake.  A great success.  My husband immediately gobbled down 4 of the cupcakes as soon as they were out of the oven.  I made a few modifications based on several other red velvet cupcake recipes I found.  I used only 2 tablespoons of cocoa and only 1 teaspoon of white vinegar.  This batch made 65 mini-cupcakes and they came out moist and delicious.  I will definitely make them again.  I used a quick and simple cream cheese/butter/powder sugar frosting and topped them with a green M&M.  They make a nice x-mas themed treat (red cake, white frosting, green candy).  Highly recommended.  Enjoy, everyone!

I was really disappointed with this recipe. It was certainly not the best red velvet cake I have ever had. It was a moist cake and baked well, but the taste was really blah.

I kind of found these just okay.  I added the amount of food coloring as recommended but the muffins ended up brown instead of red.  I'm not sure if I was expecting something different perhaps, but the flavor was nothing special.  The icing I put on them added the extra kick they needed.

As per other reviewers, I cut back on the cocoa and used only 3 tbs. I also added 3 tbs applesauce and it was awesome. Not too sweet, perfect by itself or with frosting for those with a sweet tooth. I handmixed them and baked them in a toaster oven for 18-20 mins. Will definitely do this again.

Thank you for this! Your recipe is a huge hit at bbq's and potlucks. I found a picture, I had a helper!(note the iced green squiggly one!) you can sort of see the cupcake but more the icing.. I didn't have cocoa powder so I used a little hot chocolate mix (I know probably not recommended). I also only had rice vinegar, so I used a smaller amount. I also was out of vanilla so I substituted with almond extract. I ran out of red food coloring so they weren't very red, more pinkish haha but they still tasted amazing! I didn't mean to change the recipe so much!

I MADE NO CHANGES.  This is one of the truest red velvet recipes I have come across.   All ingredients should be at room temp. Especially the buttermilk.  I have doubled this recipe at times and made a batch of cupcakes along side a single layer cake- the results were perfect.  I bake in a warm climate so room temp is easily acheived, but even if you're baking up north in the dead of winter, wait for your ingredients to get to room temp... Its worth it!  Watch your baking times;  Always check a red velvet cake mixture 5 minutes out.  After that, every 3 minutes.  Enjoy!

I have used this recipe multiple times. I change the color of the traditional Red Velvet for other holidays as well! I have always gotten great reviews from my patients, friends and family. I would have to say that when I make the cream cheese frosting for the cupcakes I always cut the sugar in half. I feel that it allows the flavor of the Red Velvet to come out rather than be masked by loads of sugar.

These did not turn out as I expected.  I found that they tasted too much like flour, I wonder if I could have sub all purpose for cake & pastry flour or added less flour.

These taste fantastic, I just have trouble getting them to come out red. The batter looks red in the bowl and as soon as they start baking it turns brown. I'm pretty sure that's me though.

I used 1/2 cup of confectioner's sugar and 1 cup of white because I ran out of white sugar. (worked great), and I used 1tsp pf vinegar + 1/2 cup of milk instead of the buttermilk. I got 18 out of the recipe.

Good recipe and easy to follow. I wanted my cupcakes larger but was still able to get about 21 cupcakes from this batter. Next time I will try swapping out the butter with applesauce for a low fat version and a little less cocoa powder (maybe a 1/4 cup).

I brought these to school for my friend's birthday, and mine were gone in a flash! I didn't have a large cupcake pan so I used a mini muffin pan and it worked fine. After putting in the food coloring I thought it wasn't dark enough so I added more and the cupcakes ended up being a dark red but were tasty nonetheless. I highly recomend! They were a  hit!

These were yummy and made cute little mini cupcakes.  However, mine did not look anything like the ones is your picture...as in they were not red, they were more auburn.  This means you should probably cut down on the coacoa powder, which I will do next time.  Also, these seemed just a tad dry and would be pretty bland if you don't add frosting.  Other than all that, it delish. thanks!

super good right out of the oven when warm, didn't really taste as good the next day. ALSO, an ounce of red food coloring is more than you think.

I was really excited to make this recipe after reading all of the great review's but I was disapointed once it was made... It doesnt taste that good, it mostly tastes like the cocoa power... The last time I had red velvet cake it was amazing and I think it had strawberry in it. If I do make this recipe again I will have to tweek it alot and probably add strawberry flavering somehow...

These are the best cupcakes I've ever had. They are phenomenally moist. I let the batter sit in the fridge for 24 hours- just because I was out of food coloring- but apparently it only made them better. I will definitely make again. My family loved them. Frosted with Janni's "Cream Cheese Frosting II" recipe.  Perfect.

This recipe was okay. Followed the recipe, but it was a little bland. Maybe it'd taste better with some alterations? Might try it again at some point...

This doesn't taste like a red velvet cake-didn't really taste like much at all. Tried making it as the recipe called for then re-made it cutting down the cocoa...neither one worked out. Texture was nice and spongy on both but all the red velvet cakes I have ever had/baked were much denser and used oil instead of butter.  I guess I will stick to my grandma's old tried and trusted OU Red Velvet cake. Too bad it is a pain in the rear to make.

Very easy recipe to follow and they tasted great the day that I made them but the next day they were as dry as sand paper.  I don't know if I did something wrong, I'm pretty sure I didn't.  But this was no good at all.

This recipe doesn't scale well. I moved to 24 servings and it was dry as a bone and the flavor shifted a bit from the time that I made it before. I'm not sure what happened because the 20 count recipe does work well. I would probably add a bit more buttermilk or a tablespoon of canola oil to the recipe to get it a bit more moist.

If you make this recipe with no changes it is not a Red Velvet cupcake recipe, it is a chocolate cake recipe with red food coloring (that still doesn't make the cupcakes red).  Red Velvet should be much more delicate with a hint of chocolate flavor.  The batter is very heavy and the cakes are dense and a muddy reddish brown color.  If you want to read through all the comments to find changes, feel free.  But I tossed these and made Bobby Flay's version and they were delicious.

This recipe was easy for a beginner to make, although not very satisfying. Definitely too chocolatey even though I only used a fourth of a cup instead of a third of the cocoa powder. Also the coloring was more of a brown.

These cupcakes had a nice flavor and texture, especially since they are made from scratch... nothing extraordinary though.  I think some adjustments have to be made if you really want RED cupcakes, these were kind of a redish-brown.

This is a really easy recipe, and the cupcakes that come out are really moist and yummy. I like to cut 1/4 of the sugar (the frosting makes up for it, I think) and add some espresso powder.

I loved these!  I lost the cake recipe but still had the frosting for red velvet frosting that my grandma gave me.  I had to travel with them so instead of frosting the tops I poked a small hole in the top and piped the frosting inside, then covered the hole with a small dollop of frosting.  They traveled beautifully then when I arrived I sifted a little powered sugar on top to accent the redness of the muffin.

I made these this afternoon to take to my doctor's office in the morning.  First, let me say that this is my second time trying this recipe.  Secondly, I tweaked it just a bit.  First go round they seemed a bit dry to me.  I bake for a lot of people so I could not be delivering "dry" goods.  That being said....I made the following changes.  I increased the butter to 3/4 cup and I used 2 jumbo eggs.  I increased the vanilla to 2 teaspoons and mixed it in with the buttermilk.  The vinegar I poured over the baking soda before I added it.  The rest of the directions were followed as is.  They smelled wonderful and tasted even better.  My daughter ate 2 of them before they could cool.  These are keepers!!

By far my favorite cupcake recipe! I use it for everything! I don't put red food coloring in because I don't find it necessary and I make my own buttermilk with 1 cup of milk and 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. Everyone loves them and they're perfect for school bake sales, birthdays and just for fun. A very simple and great recipe. Goes great with strawberry cream cheese frosting

Use less coco powder and I also did not  use any  vinegar. If you have any extra- add some more coco powder(mix well) put it in a sqaire pan and make brownies!! Whenever I make this recipe I aways add extra to make brownies and they taste great!(makes good brownie cake too??)

This recipe was a hit with family at Thanksgiving! The only thing I changed was the amount of cocoa. I reduced it to 3 tablespoons and it was perfect. It gave it a hint of chocolate taste but not too much. It was perfect!!

I don't really know how a great velvet cake would taste like, .but there is a slight odd bitter taste to this cake, I am not sure if my food colouring is too much or perhaps the cocoa is too much hence causing a stronger chemical reaction wit the vinegar like what some of the readers wrote.

The texture of the cake is good, moist and airy. The cake looks good. I managed to savage the taste by piping cream cheese frosting into the center of cupcake hence balancing it.

Maybe will do more research before making it  again

Honestly, this was my first try on this recipe....I WAS AMAZED at how delicious the recipe came out!!!! It has the perfect balance of sugar! My husband and I have very sensitive palate to sugar....it came out not too sweet. I decorated some of them with buttercream and others with powdered sugar glaze...they were DELICIOUS. If you wish to preserve their moist a bit longer, I recommend to decorate them with the sugar glaze and make sure your muffin or cupcake pan has a lid. Keep them covered in a dry but not extremely cold place.

Disappointed in these cupcakes!  Very dry.  Not sure what I could have done differently to change the outcome.  I will try another recipe next time.

I made these today, they taste really good, but when they cooked they went kinda bubbly? So they don't look very nice. :)

Almost finished making them right now. They were easy and I substituted a bit, but they look great! I didn't have red food colouring though because I hate the taste of food colouring in baked goods. :)

This is a great recipe... I made red velvet cupcake for the second time with this recipe and this time the cupcake came out super delicious.... They are moist and very soft!! The only thing is that you might want to reduce the cocoa powder since I can became a bit too chocolate (I don't know if it's because I was using baking cocoa instead!!!) In addition I added a bit of baking soda and powder to create a reaction and have it more red, and because i wanted the cupcakes to grow!!
perfect everyone just loved the cupcakes!!

This was the first recipe I've tried for red velvet cupcakes; and they turned out great! The cupcakes were light and fluffy, and topping it with a cream cheese frosting made it perfect. I didn't end up using as much red food coloring as the recipe called for, because personally I think a whole ounce of food coloring is way too much! But other than that, I would definitely recommend this recipe.

These are red but not velvet for sure.  They are more spongy choc. cake than anything.  Tasted no so great.  Red velvet is rich & dense and light at the same time.  And really red, not chocolate reddish.  The photo lied.  Never used butter in my red velvet cakes.  Always oil.

This is a good red velvet cupcake recipe. Tasted good. The cake was light but could be a bit lighter. And even with a whole 1 oz bottle of food coloring, the cake was still dark and not a bright red color. I'm willing to sacrifice color if that slightly extra cocoa flavor adds an extra yum factor to the flavor. Would have to try other recipes to find out.

These had a good flavor but had a (too much food coloring) aftertaste. I might try with less food coloring and see if the color is to compromised.

I made these for Thanksgiving (Cdn) and they were amazing. Better than anything that could have come out of a box. Thank you very much for posting this recipe. It was really easy to follow too thankfully because I am by no means a baker. Again thanks for posting a recipe that made my Thanksgiving just that much more special. :)

These were a hit! I've made them a couple times with a couple different recipes, and I did change one thing here.  I used Wilton's no taste red food coloring.  It takes away a bit of the "dyed" taste.  I've also heard of people using beets :)

Cupcakes were very easy to make. My cupcake seemed a little dried out.  Next time I will not bake as long.  The frosting was a little on the sweet side for my family but they still ate them.

Magnificent!! I used to not like red velvet cupcakes but these are delish.I am looking forward to making them again. Simple and fun to make. I thought a bit to much food coloring. If you don't put enough though it looks like chocolate cupcakes but still tastes great.
Thanks for putting the recipe on here!! I enjoyed cooking it.

Delicious!
I followed the recipe, used a total of 2 ounces of food coloring and added 1T of sour cream as suggester by another review and it was delicious and I got tons of compliments. It did not have enough chocolate for me and next time I will increase the chocolate (probably to 1/2c like someone else suggested). Also would recommend sifting the flour and chocolate together, to get it to blend better. 
For icing I used the white chocolate cream cheese frosting from red velvet cake IV which was perfect for this!

I must admit - I have never had a red velvet cupcake before, but I decided to make some and see what all the fuss was about.  Well, I am not super impressed.  First, they are not very red, despite the entire bottle of red food coloring.  They look more like a chocolate cake.  Second, they taste like cake that doesn't have enough chocolate in the recipe.  From what I have read, I actually think these have too much cocoa powder for the classic red velvet cake.  I think I will keep looking for a better recipe.  However, I thought the texture was great, the cream cheese frosting delicious and they were easy to put together.  My hubby is happy - we are having biscuits tonight because I want to use up that buttermilk!

This recipe is great! I didn't have buttermilk so I had to use a substitute but other than that I followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out great, my family loved it, it was a nice red color, light and fluffy and the kids loved it.

Had no idea what red velvet cake was, but decided it would be fun to try it for Valentines day.  They were actually really good!  The colour was not red cake like I sort of expected.. they came out brown, but not as dark as chocolate... and a lighter taste than chocolate.. very, very good though!  I used a cream cheese frosting and added red sprinkles on top.  This recipe made quite a lot of cupcakes, but they did not last long around here.  Will definately make them again

These were yummy cupcakes...but I found the amount of cocoa to be way to much, Instead of being nice and red (hello, Red velvet Cupcakes) they were chocolate brown and to much cocoa flavor...next time i'm going to cut the cocoa in half...see how that goes. really good with white chocolate cream cheese frosting. They were a hit for Valentine's.

Very moist and delicious.  I have never made or eaten red velvet before this, and I found them to simply taste like chocolate (and no red even with food coloring!).  Overall, very tasty and simple.  Use Janni's cream cheese frosting!

I have to say that while the cake consistency is great - light and moist - the flavor is not.  I didn't have buttermilk, so I had to substitute with milk and white vinegar.  The whole cake tastes like vinegar.  Will be looking for another recipe!

In terms of cake, this cake is tasty, moist, and... CHOCOLATE! It is a delicious cake, but it is NOT a red velvet cake. Red velvet cake is supposed to be a LIGHT chocolate cake, closer to German chocolate. Anyway, I made this and am disappointed that it doesn't taste like red velvet, but it sure is a good cake recipe regardless, and the red looks good for Valentine's.

Following some of the comments, I cut back on the cocoa powder because I wanted the cupcakes to be bright red like the cover photo.  Unfortunately, they still wound up looking dark red/brown like many of the other photos.  I also found the cake to be fairly dense and rather void of flavor; it definitely relied on a sweet cream cheese icing.  Unless I could get them to come out a brighter red, I would not make these cupcakes again.

My first time ever making red velvet cupcakes and they turned out great! I was a little worried when the vinegar had a reaction with the cocoa powder it got a little fizzy in the batter but they still were delicious. Next time I wouldnt use as much cocoa powder. And maybe I am just inexperienced baker but i found these guys rose quite a bit so only fill the pan half way instead of 3/4 how I usually do. Great recipe and I will be using again!

Red Velvet cake should be moist and dense like Devil's Food Cake but red instead of brown.  "Dutch" processed cocoa is used to get that effect.  It reacts differently than regular cocoa and is LESS healthy.  BUT, that's not to say that this recipe didn't taste good, because it did.  AND it had less calories due to the regular cocoa. Thanks for sharing!

My foods class made these and 7 out of 7 groups said they were dry. Usually it is only one or two groups that mess up a recipe. So when the whole class had dry cupcakes it must be the recipe.

this red velvet cupcake recipe was delicious.  I paid close attention to some of the reviews I read and made some simple changes to the recipe, specifically with the unsweetened cocoa power.  Delicious cupcakes, i would definitely bake them again.  Thank you.

Perfect as cupcakes, the icing didn't turnout but I think that was my fault.  I used store bought icing and they were wonderful.  I kept them fresh in a sealed container in the refrigerator for over a week.  Just take out of the refrigerator a couple minutes before you want to serve.  A wonderful cupcake that the kids LOVE!

yum, loved the frosting the most. wonderful. this amount of coloring is right on, if you want it the bright fake red go for it best this is nice color also ps. to all of you that think its not chocolatey enough, make a chocolate cake if you want chocolate, red velvet is MEANT to be lightly flavored with cocoa.

Delicious, although it's in part due to the suggestions I picked up in the reviews. I only used 2 tbsp of unsweetened cocoa powder and baked the cupcakes for 17-18 minutes, and they came out perfect.

This was my very first time baking cupcakes.. and I am SO HAPPY I chose this recipe!!  The coloring came out perfect, the cupcake was nice and moist.. just perfect!  The only thing I changed.. was using less cocoa - WHICH I REGRET!  I guess for a true Red Velvet, less cocoa is better.. but for my own personal preference, I like it to have more of a chocolate flavor.  My boyfriend took it to work with him...... and it was A BIG HIT!  I used Janis' Cream Cheese Frosting II too!

This recipe was very good, but i only gave 4 stars because it contained to much cocoa powder it made it into devil's food instead of red velvet. Besides the cocoa powder this cake was very moist and is perfect with cream cheese frosting.

Everything was perfect with this recipe. They were my first cupcakes that I made. I used a regular muffin dish in aluminum and had the cupcake liners but 20 to 25 minutes cooking time was too long for me and the cupcakes were a little burned at the bottom. Next time, I'll cook 18 minutes. Enjoy!

I made these for Valentine's Day for my co-workers.  I got so many compliments.  They absolutely loved them.  I have never made red velvet before and was not even sure if I liked them that much, but these were delicious.  So moist and light!

I was a little disappointed with this recipe. Even with extra food coloring my cupcakes turned out more closer to a mahogany than a red, and they were pretty flat. The consistency was just okay as well as the taste. I will probably be looking for another red velvet recipe as I do not feel this one is true to the real 'red velvet.' sorry! : (

Fantastic cupcakes!  I know that red velvet recipes typically call for only 2-3 Tbsp. cocoa powder but the fact that this one called for more is what drew me to it.  I actually threw in a little more than even called for here and the result was wonderful.  I didn't go with the standard cream cheese frosting and instead used "Creamy Chocolate Frosting" from this site which I have found to be the best frosting recipe I've tried so far. Breaking all the rules :)

Making these again for the Superbowl.. we're Cardinals fans.. so I thought a red dessert would be fun!  Only change I'll make is to use a touch less chocolate.. maybe a couple tablespoons.  This is not a chocolate cake and the chocolate should enhance the flavor, not be noticeable.  Thanks for the great recipe - GO CARDS!!!

These turned out well. I didn't have enough red food coloring on hand to make them really red but they still had a redish tint.

These cupcakes are yummy - my kids like them even without frosting and just with sprinkles on top.  Easy ingredients for last minute "snow day" recipe.

My husband loves red velvet cake and this was a hit with him. I will add a little less salt next time, as the teaspoon seemed to be a bit much for us. But overall a very nice recipe.

These are absolutely delicious our chief complaint and only complaint is that you had to use way way more food coloring then the recipe called for to get any kind of red tint. They puffed up gorgeously and we ended up with 18 large sized cupcakes

Really good cupcakes! I put buttercream and gummy hearts on them. They tasted really good. I was nervous at first because it was really pink, but when they baked they became red. I was really pleased with the colour.

I have been using a Recipe for red velvet cake that has been good, but not great. This recipe is moist and chocolatey and is perfect the way it is. No need to change a thing!  This is my new go-to for red velvet.

This is my first time making red velvet cupcakes! I followed the recipe and it came out perfectly! I made them as mini cupcakes. This recipe makes about 70! I only had to bake them for 15 minutes! Everyone loved it! They were all gone! I topped them with Jenni Cream Cheese Frosting II

Wonderful recipe.  Nice and moist.  Very simple and easy to follow.  Substituted 1Tbs vinegar to 1 cup milk for the buttermilk as I did not have any on hand.  Don't know if the real thing makes a big difference but I was very pleased with this recipe.

Terrific cupcakes. Glad I read through reviews that said to persevere when seeing how icky/glumpy the batter looked before adding the flour. It did not look promising to me, but the end result delivered.

Turned out moist and delicious! I substituted the butermilk for milk and vinegar like doublepisces suggested, and used powdered red food coloring. It was just as red as the picture; I saved the recipe because it was great.

Yummy, light and moist on the inside, just a little crisp on the outside.  Topped them with cream cheese frosting.  My family loved them, and they're quite pretty.  The amount of food coloring freaked me out, but I guess that is to be expected for a red cupcake!  :)

My cupcakes are moist, tender, and tasty. My only issue is that they look more like pink devil's food, rather than red velvet, and I had cut the cocoa to 1/4 cup. I would make this again, but reduce the cocoa to a tablespoon or two, and increase the red colouring.

Pretty good, flavour is not as 'velvety' as expected, but overall a good cupcake. Iced with a plain vanilla frosting, turned out nicely.

I just made these cupcakes and I only put half of the food colouring. The cocoa powder and the vinegar react and turn red-brown so the food colouring only enhanced the colour of the cupcake.

Way too much cocoa.  I followed the original recipe exactly.  It tastes like chocolate cake, not red velvet cake.  I would cut the cocoa in half at least.

This was good but not the red velvet taste I was looking for. It tastes very chocolatey so I do suggest reducing the amount of cocoa. I will make it again.

Good flavor and good texture. Batter was pretty scary looking before adding in the flour/cocoa but they turned out well. Rose nicely and were great with some cream cheese frosting.

These were good. I didn't have buttermilk so I used heavy whipping cream and put about a teaspoon of vinegar in it.

I read some of the reviews and only added two tablespoons of cocoa as many of the other red velvet cakes have.  They still turned out brownish and the cupcakes were holey.  I did not like them at all.  Actually tasted a bit spongy.

I just made this cake and haven't tasted it yet, but I think everyone might be right about there being too much cocoa powder.  My cake is definitely more brown than it is red.  I was disappointed.  But they smell delicious!

Good, adaptable recipe. I substituted 1/4 white sugar for packed brown sugar. I also ran out of buttermilk so I made my own. I substituted half of the butter for canola oil and I doubled the vanilla. I think it would have been plain had I not used some brown sugar and more vanilla. Housemates gobbled them up before I could frost...need I say more?

This recipe is amazing. I never had a red velvet one, so I don't know how it taste like...but for the first time, I think this is delicious. Its like chocolate cake, but doesn't taste too chocolaty and its RED lol. I made this for my friend birthday party, and a friend of mine who were there which had tested red velvet cupcakes before, said that mine its better, she loves it and she eats it two in a row. And a friend which I just knew from the party, even contact me after the day to ask me if I ever know where he can get red velvet cupcakes in a town and he even blame me for introducing to him the red velvet because he already fall in love with it. lol - but thats the best compliment so farr I ever get. so thanks to this recipe ! I didn't change a thing, the buttermilk makes this cupcakes very moist. loved it. xx

This recipe was not too difficult to make, however the end result was not what I expected. I made a dozen cupcakes and 10 mini cupcakes with the batter I had left. They all turned out flat and fell appart when I took them out of the mini cupcake pan. When putting in the batter to the regular sized cupcakes, fill it up at least half way because it overflows! All in all, I probably won't be making this recipe again. Hope this helps!

I thought these were pretty plain.  I didn't use the food coloring, but the taste was pretty bland because of all the cocoa powder.  And they definitely need a homemade cream cheese frosting, the canned kind simply will not do.

It's a good recipe overall. However I think it's a bit too heavy on the cocoa powder. They don't taste like red velvet to me. They taste more like a richer chocolate cupcake. The cocoa stands out a lot.

I hadn't made these before trying this recipe.  After adding the cocoa mine turned green as well.  I didn't have enough red food coloring so that's my fault.  They still tasted good and were moist.  I added some store-bought cream cheese frosting to the top.  Next time, I will make sure I have enough red food coloring.

Wonderful! I put dough into two 9inch cake pans and cooked for about three minutes longer than the cupcakes called for. The cake was flavorful and moist. It got rave reviews at my grandfather's birthday party. Will definately make again!

They came out just as moist as they can be and even the chocolate taste wasn't too overpowering, everything balanced out wonderfully- loved them!  Everyone that I shared them w/ agreed with me, even my picky 7yr old was happy!! These came out way better then I thought they would... YES even w/ all the POS feedback!  See I had a bad experience the first time I ate Red Velvet, so I was a little iffy to try and eat RED VELVET EVER!!  Well, I just want to say that I'm so glad that it worked out for the better *wink* & So glad that I actually made them myself(for the first time ever), that way I know what I need to do to tweak and improve on so they eventually become my own!  I did take in all of the suggestions/changes that the reviewers posted and adjusted mine to that(for now).  I will definitely be making these again.  Thanks for sharing...

Fantastic recipe. Very moist which is usually lacking in homemade cake recipes. This was my first time making red velvet cake and I definately recommend it for any other first timers. It wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked. I think next time I'll use a little more cocoa. But all in all very good.

I tried really hard to mess this recipe up.  Despite the fact that I forgot to add the buttermilk until after everything else had already been added,  they still came out nicely.  I cut off the tops then used a small biscuit cutter to get a hockey puck shape.  I then combined it with "Shiny Chocolate Glaze" submitted by KITTYCATGRL and ended up with a very tempting little Ding-Dong.  Best Ding-Dong I ever had.  Thanks, pinkspoonula!  Now only if I could remember to take pictures...

Excellent recipe! Made these into heart shaped cupcakes for Valentine's Day and they look absolutely darling, and taste even better!  Incredibly moist and dense. The perfect Red Velvet Cupcake! Next I will try using Dutch Processed Cocoa!

I didn't have vinegar and left it out and used 2 heaping TB of cocoa powder (for no real reason) and it is AMAZING!!! The one's that said this was dry might not have used butter or did not CREAM the butter and sugar long enough!!! GREAT!!! I used a simple cream cheese frosting...SO GOOD!!!

Wonderful recipe and super easy!!! The cupcakes came out extremely moist and were such a hit with my superbowl guests. I only made a few revisions: I lessened the cocoa and added just a little bit more buttermilk.     For next time, I probably wont use the whole bottle of red dye AND I will opt for a different frosting. The one I used wasnt as stiff as I wouldve like it. Other than that, this recipe was amazingly easy! Would make again for sure.

These were so easy to make, and tasted delicious. I made them for an office party and everyone was falling over themselves in tasty delight! I paired these with the Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting recipe.

These were really yummy! MMMM! I picked this recipe because it was the only Red Velvet Cupcake recipe from an actual person, not a company trying to get you to use THEIR sugar, or THEIR vanilla extract brand. :) It was delish, 100%. :)

Very good, and quite beautiful.  Adding a whole bottle of food coloring does seem strange, but it really makes the cupcakes a gorgeous color!  The chocolate flavor is subtle, but nice.  Make these and enjoy!

I think they could have been a tad moister, but they were a hit! I also used the Cream Cheese Frosting II by Janni which was FANTASTIC.  Delicious and festive.

I really enjoyed making these cupcakes with my daughter. We made mini cupcakes which everyone enjoyed. The one thing/reason I gave it a 4 and not a 5 is because of the batter, I had an issue with the consistency of the wet batter before adding the dry. The batter looked a bit weird in that it was kind of cottage cheese like, not sure if it was the use of vinegar or if I did something wrong but I would ultimately omit the vinegar as it seemed to be an unecessary ingredient. I'll let you all know how that worked! Overall very tasty loved the color and taste!

This is a great recipe. I frosted them with a whipped cream cheese frosting (recipe from allrecipes). They only thing I didn't like was the amount of red food coloring required, I scaled back a bit and they still had a nice red hue. I guess it depends on how important the final color is to you— they are red velvet afterall. Very delicious for sure!

These were a huge hit at my office. I made them as directed with whipped cream cheese frosting (my fav) from this site. I don't even like red velvet normally, and even I enjoyed one of these. I'll be making them again.

Great! However, I agree with some other reviewers that there may be a little too much cocoa. It just tasted too chocolaty to me. Still delicious, though!

I followed the recipe exactly except the cooking time.  Everyone's oven cooks a little different, just keep an eye on your cupcakes- I cooked mine for 17 minutes and when I checked them, they were done.  They were not dry at all, and my husband, the true critic, thought they were delicious.

I made these for Valentine's Day and they were my first attempt at making homemade cupcakes.  They turned out decent, I might have cooked them just a tad too long as they were a little dry.  But, adding some frosting to them, you couldn't really tell the dryness.  I ran out of red food coloring so between that and the cocoa powder they didn't get as red but more of a brown color.  Will definitely make again though and watch my baking time a little closer!

VERY Good!!  Great texture, and these are absolutely gorgeous in presentation.  That deep red is beautiful, but I will cut that a touch next time because you can TASTE the food coloring (mostly as an aftertaste)... Used a cream cheese frosting, which I tinted pink and used various Valentine's decorations atop of the cupcakes.

Made this recipe for the first time last week to take to a dinner / get-together.  Cut the recipe in half.  Came out GREAT!  Everyone loved them!  My husband (not a big sweet / cake eater) asked that I make this recipe again.  Definitely a keeper!

I hate to give this 4 stars, but something went wrong with my batch.  Maybe I didn't mix them long enough, i mixed until "just blended" like it said.  One of the cupcakes (I guess) was not mixed enough and ended up almost exploding all over the pan, and turned a weird color and had a weird taste.  However, I am sure It was my mistake!!  I did manage to salvage that cupcake and made it my "tester" once i cut away the weird dark colored parts.  I would definitely make this again and try to figure out what I did wrong!  They are really good with cream cheese frosting II from this site (the one with more reviews b/c I noticed there were two)!

These were definitely the best red velvet cake I've made myself (I used cream cheese frosting to top them).  They were a bit dry though, and I followed the directions exactly.  I think next time I may experiment with a little oil so to get some more moisture in.  Also - possibly a little more cocoa because I prefer them more chocolatey.  Overall, good recipe.

This recipe is horrible. I followed every direction because i am a new baker and would like to test out others recipe's and this was very bad. 1st it really did not have any flavor, 2nd it was not moist AT ALL. Like my whole family hated it. I do not recommend this recipe to anyone.

I made these cupcakes and I had my doubts when the batter was a bit chunky. But when they came out, and I tried one I loved them. they were moist, and the chocolate taste was perfect! I would definitely make them again.

Amazing! They didn't turn out red because I added 1/2 cup cocoa. I used additional 1/4 cup veg oil and 1 tbsp plain yogurt and 2 oz red food colouring. Despite not being red they were sooooo good. I will definitely try them again

I made this recipe for Valentine's Day gifts for the family and it was a success. I normally have a hard time with cupcakes, probably it is that I overcook them, but these were amazing. Did not change a thing! No need to. Added White Chocolate Cream Cheese frosting and even added Chocolate hearts and Love text for the top. Fun.....xo

I made this cupcake for both of my granddaughter's birthdays and they loved them.  I used dark chocolate cocoa so they turned out really dark. Thus,  I renamed them  "Black Velvet Cupcakes"!!

so for some reason, i didnt think to add milk to the powdered buttermilk at first, so i added olive oil (even tho there was already butter), then was like oh right, and added liquid 1% milk. i didnt have food coloring, but i liked the authentic color. they turned out amazing and supet moist and spongy. i definitely reccommend. red velvet is my favorite

In the spirit of full disclosure, I did not add the full amount of red food coloring as it was crazy expensive!  Mine were dry and not very flavorful.  Probably my bad!!!

I thought this was absolutely horrible!! I bake frequently, and absolutely couldn't eat these. I ended up throwing them in the garbage. The color was too dark, much too brown. They had a texture like a wet sponge, and they tasted burnt, even though they weren't. I did do the 'regular milk plus vinegar' trick for the buttermilk, but made everything else exactly like directed.

Decent red velvet recipe. Make sure that you use room temperature eggs and buttermilk to make them a lot fluffier. I'm using them for Valentine's Day gifts, so I used heart shaped cookie molds. 
I also used a vanilla cocoa frosting: 1 stick butter, 1 1/4 cup powdered sugar, 1 teaspoon vanilla, hint of milk, and a teaspoon of cocoa. 
I made chocolate heart garnishes by piping melted chocolate onto parchment in the form of hearts after frosting them. 
An adjustment I would make is to add way more red food coloring. It's supposed to be a bright vibrant red. It was more of dirty reddish brown.

I have celiacs and am lactose intolerant so I made a couple changes.  Used a gluten free all purpose flour blend,  used apple cider vinegar instead ad I didn't have the one this recipie calls for,  as well as used almond milk instead of buttermilk.  Turned out just great!  Just wanted to share in case there's anyone else with allergies :)

I have not made these yet, but can't wait to try them. To Nancy, the frosting you described where you cook the flour & milk, etc. - my mother got that recipe from her mother many years ago and my grandma always called it "Grandma's White Goo Frosting." It is delicious and I love it on applesauce cake also.

I liked it. The colour was fine but the moisture didn't seem enough for me unlike the red velvet cakes I have had. I used 2 tbsp of cocoa and substituted buttermilk for one cup of whole milk mixed with a tablespoon of lemon juice and let sit for 10 minutes.

Easy to make, but they didn't have much of a flavour to them. Next time I make, I think I will try adding more chocolate.

I rated this 2 stars because they didn't turn out very moist, and I don't think they tasted a whole lot like red velvet.

I followed the directions exactly as written but my red velvet cupcakes were brown. They tasted ok though but I wanted the impact of the red.

I have now made this recipe 3 times, putting slightly less butter and a spoonful or two of applesauce. I also increase the cocoa powder by about 1 tbsp, increase vanilla and sub real buttermilk with a vinegar milk mixture. They get rave reviews. My boyfriend said "These are the BEST cupcakes you've ever made!", and I make a LOT of cupcakes :) Last time I put a dollop of chocolate ganache frosting on top then cover it with buttercream.

These were amazing!  I love making things from scratch and having them come out way better than any mix could do.  I made these for Valentines day for my boyfriend and he loved them.  I used the "1 tbsp of vinegar in a measuring cup and fill with milk to the 1 cup line and let sit for 5 min" thing for a substitute for buttermilk. It did make 24 decent sized cupcakes and I frosted them with white frosting.

I made this for a thing at my daughter's school and it came out pretty great! I would add a little more red color next time and I thought they were a little bit too dense, but my husband loved them and thought they were perfect. I would definitely make again, but I think I will sift the flour and see if that lightens them up a bit.

My 8 year old son's favorite cake is red velvet cake and this is the recipe I use every year for his birthday.  This makes wonderful red velvet cupcakes.  I use buttercream frosting to frost.
