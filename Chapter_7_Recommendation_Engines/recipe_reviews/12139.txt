I fixed this pie for a family dinner and got rave reviews. In place of the meringue, I used a whipped topping made from cream cheese, sour cream, sugar and vanilla with cool whip folded in. The combination of the 2 tastes blended wonderfully and was a nice change from meringue.

The taste was awful!  The pie set up beautifully.  I used a graham cracker crust, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

This pie was delicious, and very rich tasting. I used 1 whole egg and 2 egg whites, to cut down on the yolk content. I liked the fact that it was not all sugar also. This is my chocolate pie recipe from now own... Thanks Linda.

I made this the Christmas afternoon when I didn't have enough desserts. It was made for my brother-in-law. He LOVED it!!!!! I used regular white milk instead of evaporated milk and it was Fantastic!!! It will be the only Chocolate Pie I make ever again.

This was good, but next time I won't use so many eggs, I think 3 egg yolks would be enough.  It was a little eggy.

I multiplied each batch of this recipe by 5 to make a whole bunch of pies for friends at Christmas. Not only is it delicious, but very easy.

WAAYYYY TO many eggs I use 3 egg yolks and 2 whites.  Unless you like it eggy tasting, don't use that many eggs.  And if you use that much egg whites there will be way to much let over.  Been making this pie for years and my fiance would flip if it was ever done wrong this is his favorite dessert.

I've been looking for a replication of my grandmother's chocolate pie, which was lost along with many others in a fire a few years ago.  I read this and knew it was close, so I tried it.  It's not the deep rich chocolate I'm looking for, but reviewing this recipe as is, it's EXCELLENT.  Good, smooth chocolate flavor.  I was ONLY trying the FILLING, so I just put down a few cinnamon graham crackers and put it in a casserole dish.  I'll keep looking but for anyone looking for a really good chocolate meringue pie, this is it! BTW, because I LOVE meringue, I used all the whites...just reduce oven temp after a few minutes and bake longer at the reduced heat to cook them through and not burn the top.

The texture of the filling is great, but most chocolate pies will have at least twice the amount of sugar. My family definitely thought sugar was missing, so I probably will try making it again but will double the sugar.
