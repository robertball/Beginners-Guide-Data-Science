This is quite delicious. The only issue I had was the chia seeds clumped together. I suggest mixing it periodically to separate the seeds. Leaving it alone overnight led to large clumps of dry seeds. These proved difficult to separate because they hardened. I also added a bit of agave syrup the next day. The amount of sugar was a bit less than what I prefer. Thank you for the recipe.

I did not think my family would like this dish.   It was a big hit.  I did add extra vanilla extract and brown sugar.  Love it!!!

This is such a simple pudding... the recipe gets the ratio right, but I personally feel like using a nut milk or coconut milk with real maple syrup is the way to go (vs. cow milk and white sugar). Layer or top with fruit. Yum.

I made this and it was delicious. I had no problems with clumping. Came out delicious and will definitely make again. No extra sugar needed
