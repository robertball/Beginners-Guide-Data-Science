I sauteed a tablespoon of diced onion and small sprig of rosemary in butter, added a little chicken stock and wine first then the beans and peas and cooked as directed. Delizioso!

Made this recipe tonight as written. Very good dish. I ended up putting more pepper on it when at the dining table so will probably double the pepper when cooking next time. Thanks for the recipe

This would be a good side dish to go along with a main of choice. If I were to make this again I will saute some onions to add to the mixture and garnish with crispy bacon bits.
