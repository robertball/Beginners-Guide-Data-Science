This is a good, solid recipe. I made just a few minor changes: sauteed fresh garlic with the meat instead of using garlic powder, added a few extra seasonings, and cut the meat down to one pound. As always, I used a little Ziploc baggy with the corner cut out to pipe the filling into the shells. Hassle free! I prepared this early in the day, refrigerated, then baked for dinner. Turned out great. Thanks :)

I used ricotta cheese to replace the cottage cheese. I suggest you use jarred spaghetti sauce and not tomato sauce. Lastly, a quick tip I suggest to all even professional chefs, do NOT par boil your pasta first. If you are making this or manicotti, it is easier to stuff if you do it raw, then add a little watered down sauce to the bottom of the dish and seal it with tin foil. This will a help it cook in much better stuff than boiling water. You can also substitute wine to dilute your sauce.

Absolutely LOVED, LOVED, LOVED this recipe!  I made it for my family last night for the very first time - what can I say, it'll definitely be added to the rotation on cooler days!  The only things I did differently was substitute spaghetti sauce for the tomato paste and sauce, in addition to substituting ricotta cheese for the cottage cheese.  Piping the cheese mixture into the shells by using a baggie with the corner cut off was a brilliant suggestion.

This is just what I was looking for in stuffed shells!  I love that it uses cottage cheese - healthier!  Everyone loved it.  It's a keeper!  Thanks for posting this recipe.

I didn't follow this recipe to exact, I did my own version. I didn't use jumbo shells, I used smaller sized shells. I didn't stuff the shells with any cheese. I layered the ground beef at the bottom of the pan and then cheese and then the shells, and topped it off with more of the sauce with the ground beef and some mozzarella cheese.

Good basic recipe. I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese.  Also used Kraft Italian blend cheese instead of mozzerella. Used a can of tomato sauce, can of diced tomatoes with sauteed onions and garlic with ground beef.  Put all  into blender to make an awesome meat sauce. Hubby loved it. We'll be having leftovers for lunch.

A good stuffed shell recipes that you can easily change to your likes.  I made as written, only I got a lot more shells than 18.  I made a small pan for our dinner and flash froze the leftover cheese-filled shells.  To make filling the shells super-easy, I filled my pastry tube with the cheese filling and used the largest tip I own.  I will never again fill the shells with a spoon.  Served this delicious meal with a tossed salad and 'Jimmbo's Garlic Knots' from AR.

This was delicious and I will definitely make it again! Something I did to make it easier on me, I stuffed the UNCOOKED shells and placed them on top of the sauce mixture stuffed to overflowing with the cheese mixture, put the 2nd half of the sauce layer on top of that. Then I poured 1 cup of water over the top of the sauce and added the cheese last. I covered tightly with foil and cooked for an hour and then turned off the oven and let it sit in the oven for 10 min afterwards. The shells were cooked perfectly and I didn't have an extra pot to clean! I did make this with 24 jumbo shells in a 13x9.

Had to tweak a little since I didn't have the tomato paste and sauce on hand.  I did have 3/4 of a jar of spaghetti sauce, so I substituted that instead.  I also only used 1 egg, and in the cottage cheese mix I used shredded parmesan and romano cheese.  Turned out really cheesey, but that's way hubby and I like it.  Turned out really good.  Definitely will be making again.

The kids loved it, even requesting it for their school lunch the next day.  The only changes I did was saute garlic with the meat and onions; and the tomato paste I used was a tomato basil blend.  Thanks for the suggestion of using a ziploc bag to fill the shells.  It made for a quick job.

a convenient way to serve as a buffet dish. Great taste, and unusual with the cottage cheese filling. Thank you for including us in this new idea for an old recipe.

this recipe is wonderful...even better on the second day.  I did change a few things...instead of the tomato paste, etc. I used a jar of my favorite spaghetti sauce and I used Ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese.  WONDERFUL....and my son had to helpings.

Perfect as written. I've made it according to directions and it's superb. My rating is based on the recipe as written.

I make both the egg/cheese mixture and the beef/sauce mixtures ahead of time (a day ahead, even), and I always add crushed garlic, because ... garlic! To make things a little easier on myself, I often use a jar of pasta sauce instead of the tomato paste/sauce combo the recipe calls for. I put the cheese mixture in a gallon Ziploc and pipe it into the shells that way. 

Super amazing. I make it often for guests and people LOVE it and beg for the recipe. This is my go-to heavy pasta dish.

The last time I made this I used Ricotta,this time the cottage cheese. Using my own homemade sauce,I chopped up the meatballs,and added a box of cooked spinach to the cottage part. Since I dipped for taste I know this is another winner tonite! My hubby is going to be so haappppy! Awesome shells! thanks!

This Recipe was great! I didn't make any changes except I made up half of the sauce with the ground beef, and half of the sauce with vegetarian crumbles.  My boyfriend and I both loved this recipe, it was very flavorful and filling.  I will be making this again!

I had a bunch of ingredients I needed to get rid of, and this recipe suited them well. I used jarred sauce, 2 cups of ricotta instead of the cottage cheese, extra mozz. since I was low on ricotta, and 1/4 cup onion to use it up. Lastly, I added 1/4 tsp fennel seeds to the meat sauce for a more authentic lasagna taste. I have to agree with others that there is too much meat, which is why I deducted 1 star. I really enjoyed this, and will make again closer to the recipe.

Loved this recipe! I preferred the cottage cheese mixture to a riccota. It had a perfect blend of flavors. I used the Cabot brand, which was nice and thick, as other cottage cheeses can be loose or watery. The result was a very tasty but not heavy filling. I did use my own sauce instead of the one given. Will definately make again!

Everyone loved it!  Made it for Christmas Eve party.   Actually I made it a few days ahead of time and froze it and it came out perfect.  I just set it out for a several hours to thaw then followed the rest of the directions.

This is truly a recipe for life! 
As a newly wed, I try to experiment but not enough to come off as an amateur. I really  dislike when someone rates a recipe and add or remove a ton of ingredients, it's not the same recipe anymore. I tried this exactly as it was and it was almost perfect. I added a cup of ricotta cheese which made it perfect which is why I only gave it 4 stars. Out of all the recipes I'm so glad I chose this one because it was really simple and even better than I imagined. Thank you.

This is a very easy recipe to make.  I did not use the sauce in the recipe, but used a jar of spaghetti sauce.  It was easier and tasted great.  I used oregano instead of parsley in the cheese blend.  The recipe makes 30 shells, so add a little extra sauce.

I did make modifications, but this was really good.  I boiled the shells to al dente insted of only 5 minutes. I used 1 c cottage cheese and 2 c ricotta. I poured store bought sauce in the bottom of the pan since other reviews said there wasn't enough sauce and I put all of the homemade sauce on top of th shells. I used ground turkey instead of beef, and in addition to the onion I cooked it with minced garlic and red pepper flakes.  Super delicious and everyone loved it! (Oh, and based on other reviews I squeezed the cheese mixture through the corner of a ziplock which is SO much easier than spooning it into the shells)

I didn't follow the recipe exactly like I should have. (Bad habit of mine!) So, my cheese mixture was way too soft for me to stuff the shells. Therefore, I had to add bread crumbs to the cheese to give it more texture, and it turned out really great! I highly recommend this recipe to everyone! Just make it easier on yourself and actually follow the recipe! LOL

Very good, but I altered it a lot, only because I realized last minute that I didn't have all the ingredients. I used half ground turkey and half ground beef. I went to substitute ricotta for cottage cheese (since I didn't have any) and realized I didn't have enough of that either, so I substituted one cup of Ricotta for one package of cream cheese. Also only had half the mozzarella so I used Monterrey/Colby jack and oops since I was in a rush forgot to mix the salt, pepper and parsley in to the cheese so it topped the shells before the meat sauce was added. It was still good enough for both my 4 year old and my man to want more!

This is a great new way to look at lasagna.  I always make two batches; one for now and one for the freezer.  My kids ask for this constantly and will eat leftovers for this one.

This recipe was so good! I had to make a few changes for my taste, I substituted ricotta cheese for the cottage cheese, used fresh garlic instead of the garlic powder and added italian seasoning to the meat mixture instead of just dried oregano. It turned out wonderful and I will be making this again. Thanks!

I really liked this, but naturally I made some changes to fit my tastes better. For one I substituted the tomato paste and the tomato sauce with actual (chopped) tomatoes plus maybe 1/2 cup of water, just because it's healthier that way (I don’t eat things that come in a can).  And two, I substituted all the cheeses for Feta cheese, which I LOVE, and it turned out great. I made two dinners and one breakfast out of it. All in all, a great recipe.

DELIZIOSO.  EASY. I doubled recipe, also used 2 and a bit jars of basil spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce. Very good,
lots of meat and can generously fill shells with cheese. I felt it needed a bit more sauce as it was cooking I just opened a jar and sprinkled more over top to mix in a bit. Perfect. Will freeze well. Iloveit  2nd time I used all the tomato sauce instead of the jars ,,still very good, needs more Italian spice this way. Both ways good,,but less work with jars , so going for that.

8 5 16 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/170463/lasagna-stuffed-shells/ ... Using 18 shells, they are quite full - overflow when cut.  I don't mind that, but the kids did.  :/  I'd try 20.  No meat, upped onion to a quarter cup or so & added fresh garlic, too; no powdered garlic   I only used 15oz t sauce, no paste, 1t basil, 1/2t oregano & sugar, 1/16t cayenne.  Simple & good.  I suppose adding the salt & pepper in there would be good, but I didn't.  Watch the pepper though, if you're adding cayenne.

My family likes more garlic flavor so I used real garlic and more of it instead of the powder. I added it to the beef while it cooked. Also I added basil (same amount as oregano) and water along with the tomato sauce and paste, maybe a cup, because it seemed way too thick. That made it more of a sauce consistency. I really liked the shell filling, and there was enough left to fill another 5 shells and then some. I just spooned the rest over the top before the sauce. I'll probably use it the next time I make lasagna! That being said I don't think I'll go through the extra work of the shells, I'll just use noodles.

It was ok. Too much cheese, I had extra cheese filling. Used ricotta cheese instead which is a great substitute. The sauce was just way too thick and could use more oregano or other seasonings.

This was good. I used crumbled hot italian sausage instead of ground beef. The only downside to stuffed shells is that it was really messy for me to get the cheese mixture into the shells.

This was a good dish but I made some changes. I added my jar sauce as well as a small can of tomato sauce. I added carrots and fresh garlic, minced.  The shells were filled with the cottage cheese, eggs and parm as directed but I did not like it as much.  I used cottage cheese for the mostacciolli bake and that turned out well.  I think the next time I make it will be with ricotta cheese instead.  Other than that it was a tasty pasta dish.  A decent variation of lasagna.

I didn’t make the sauce, I just used jarred instead. With that being said... YUM! Perfect as written, I added a little granulated garlic to the cheese, just because I like the taste. Yummy, solid recipe as written.

Yummy! We used ricotta cheese and “meatless” meat from the brand Quorn. Took advice from another review on here about cutting the corner off a ziploc bag to fill the shells and that was a great tidbit it was!

I didn’t have cottage cheese because I could find it at the supermarket. Overall I followed the recipe using chicken instead of beef due to personal preference. It was tasty. Definitely something I’d make again.

Really liked this dish. I made it easier with pasta sauce and used hot Italian sausage sautéed with onion and bell and a bit of red pepper flakes, then wilted chopped fresh spinach. I added just a little sauce to the meat/cheese mix and just dumped the rest of the jar on top. I see now where I did it backwards, but it worked out really well because I didn't want to have just a cheese filled shell.

This stuffed shells was very good. I only used 1 pound of hamburger instead of one and a half. Next time I make it will leave out the tomato paste. Not sure that is needed since there is tomato sauce.

I make this frequently.  I like the portion sizes so you don't have to cut a lasagna.  The only difference I make is I mix the hamburger into the cheese mixture and stuff the shells with that mixture.  Everyone thinks it is better when you do't have a mouth full of cheese.  I also use ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese.  I have been making it this way for years and I get requests from family to make it.

I like Italian lasagna because it is a bit spicy. I added a pinch or two of crushed red pepper flakes. Perfect

This turned out delicious. The only changes I made was what alot of the other reviewers suggested I used jarred spaghetti sauce and ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese. My husband and kids loved it. I will definitely keep this on rotation.

This recipe was incredible. I have made it twice now. Hubby cannot stop raving about it. I don’t usually write reviews because I don’t actually follow recipes. This was a wonderful starting point though, I pride myself on my ability to adapt recipes. The only thing that I do differently is TASTE everything. I make sure that my sauce is not bland and same with my filling. I do add garlic and Italian seasoning to the filling. Do yourself a favour and make this!

I just want to say that I love the cottage cheese! So many people in the reviews say to change to ricotta, but I think cottage cheese taste great in this recipe. Also, 12 oz. of tomato paste is way too much. I use maybe 4 oz and add more sauce.

Really good. I follow the suggestions and used ricotta instead of cottage cheese. I also used spagehetti sauce and sauteed onions, garlic and peppers. It was a nice meal. The only thing i would do differently is add a touch of spice.

This is an amazing dish!  Everyone loved it!  

That said, I will probably make a few changes the next time I make it.  There seemed to be too much cheese mixture for the amount of shells.  So, next time, I'll either use more shells or make less cheese.

delicious.  I followed other reviews and used real garlic.  Didn't have all the ricotta, so i subbed with a cup of plain greek yogurt to make up the difference.  Otherwise, perfect.

This was an awesome recipe! I took the tips of a couple other reviewers and it came out great. I used ricotta instead of the cottage cheese and jarred spaghetti sauce. I chopped some fresh parsley to put it in the filling and to top it off.

Very good. I added 1/2 tsp basil, 1/2 tsp cayenne, and red wine (for a looser consistency) prior to the 5 min boil. Everyone loved it...It was great comfort food! Will definitely make it again!

I made exactly as directed, wasnt sure about the cottage cheese, but went for it anyway! it turned out decent, but next time I am def going to tweak it to my own liking, by making my own sauce that isnt so bland, substituting the cottage cheese for most likely ricotta,  as well as adding some italian sausage and a few other special ingredients.

Very very delicious!! Kinda putsy when stuffing the shells but easy otherwise. I thought the sauce was too thick so next time I'll use a smaller tomato paste and more sauce. I followed the cheese stuffing to the T, but I had loads of leftover, so I put extra on each shell. I added way more onions (cuz we LOVE onions), extra garlic (love garlic too), and I added 2 hot Italian sausages (removed from casings) cuz we love extra meat (maybe this is why the sauce was too thick?) But overall, very very yummy (and with a salad and garlic cheese bread the perfect supper for me and my wonderful husband). Of course loads of leftovers but that's okay...we love that too!!!

Everybody loved it! I will be making this again! I used two pounds of beef and adjusted everything else accordingly. This is a recipe that you don’t have to be exact with the measurements. I added minced garlic with the onions and browned them up together before adding the beef.

Good recipe, just needs some tweaks. Use ricotta! Cottage cheese in lasagna is blasphemy. The recipe made waaay more cheese filling than needed for 18-ish large shells. Recommend using ground sausage instead of beef. Use less paste and more tomato sauce; sauce per the recipe is very thick and heavy.

I love stuffed shells and I think this recipe is good! But, if you are going to the trouble of making this dish, why use powdered garlic? It is too important an ingredient to use powdered!  If you want to kick it up a notch or two, fresh spices and Italian sausage is the only way to go!

Good, solid recipe! However, I substituted the cottage cheese for ricotta and used canned tomato sauce and added a can of diced tomatoes. I also sauteed onions as well as fresh garlic with the ground beef along with some extra seasonings. I will definitely be making this again!

It's in the oven right now, so I haven't tasted yet, but if I were to make this again I would need 5 extra shells, and maybe another small can of tomato sauce to thin it out for easier spreading. It's pretty thick when you're trying to work with it, but maybe it will spread out with more heat.

So yummy! Followed another reviewers suggestion and used ricotta cheese. Used my own sauce, as it is a family favourite.  Would definitely make again!

I'm lazy so I just substituted a jar of my favorite marinara instead of making the sauce and it came out perfect.  I keep getting asked to make it for friends.

We liked these, but made a few changes. I sautèed minced garlic with the meat instead of using garlic powder, and cut the meat down to one pound. I also used my own homemade marinara and completely omitted the cottage cheese because we do not like it. I added extra mozzarella and parmesan to compensate.

This recipe is really good... my family really liked it. I think next time I will add some prego sauce to the meat mixture to make it a little bit saucy, and I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese but other than that it was a hit :)

A good idea with the stuffed shells with the meat mixture on the bottom and top. I subsituted Ricotta and a half of pound of ground chuck mixed with a half of pound of Italian sausage adds more flavor to the meat sauce. The other spices are purely personal likes. I love some fennel in my sauce. I used a jar and half of already prepared sauce and added more mozzarella cheese on the top and COVERED at 375 for 40 minutes. We prefer a wetter pasta and the cheese seems to taste better. Thank You for Sharing. PS Fresh Parsley is a must

Nice alternative to the onerous task of making lasagna. I used ground beef and sweet Italian sausage with minced garlic. Substituted ricotta cheese for the cottage cheese. Next time, I'm using a pastry bag for the filling - the spoon bit is for the birds.

I really liked this recipe. I used ground turkey and hot Italian turkey sausage. I also took the advise of other reviews and used jar spaghetti sauce and ricotta cheese. I add additional seasonings to the shell mixture and the meat sauce to give it more flavor. It was a big hit it my house.

This was great. I used Ricotta instead of cottage cheese. I used a whole box of jumbo shells. Wish I would have doubled the cheese mixture. Also doubled the tomotae sauce mixture.

I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese. Also, I had a few shells left that I filled with the meat sauce and mozzarella cheese. They turned out great. The dish was a huge success and leftovers were gone in no time.

Made it with the ricotta cheese and garlic as suggested by others (I would have  used garlic anyway; Garlic on everything - I'm not dating ) ; I loved the zip lock corner of the bag tip!!    Delicious and will definitely make again.

I did like this recipe, however I found the sauce to be too thick as written.  As others have done, I will adjust the sauce next time to be more to our liking.  The cheese mixture was great (I too substituted ricotta).

I used ricotta like others suggested and did.  Also, I cooked the shells for about 3 min and used a freezer bag with the corner cut to stuff the shells (also as suggested).   To my sauce I added green pepper and onion, next time I will use clove garlic instead of powder.  Wonderful recipe!

My fiancé and I both loved it! I used fresh garlic instead, and used 1.13 pounds of meat, which was plenty! Could use a little more kick or Italian flavoring but still very scrumptious and I will be making this again!

I used minced garlic instead of garlic powder, and 2 cups ricotta and 1 cup cottage cheese. I also jazzed up the sauce. It was delicious!

This recipe caught my eye as a interesting twist on lasagna. It does take a while to put together, but the result is great. The 1st time I made this I followed the recipie and the 2nd time, I did change a few things. 1) I used fresh chopped garlic instead of garlic powder 2) I used 2 jars of spaghetti sauce instead of the tomato sauce & paste 3) I used a combination of smoked & regular mozzarella. 
My dish ended up with 25 shells and the small changes made a big difference. 
I will make this again for sure.  Thanks for the great base recipe!

Delicious! A nice twist on classic lasagna! We swapped out the cottage cheese for ricotta. Next time, we plan to add spinach to the cheese mixture, as well as some extra seasoning, such as fresh basil.

I made this as written, except for the use of ricotta cheese in place of cottage cheese.  With any tomato sauce, I add garlic,  onion powder, sugar to the sauce.  I also used fresh herbs: oregano, basil and parsley.  Made this for a friend's birthday...she loved it!

Good basic recipe.  Used hot italian sausage instead of hamburger and added fresh garlic and parser instead of powder and flakes.  I would up the amount of sauce a little and cut back a little on the cottage cheese mixture.

This was a delicious, hearty meal! The sauce was a little bland and too thick for my taste though. If I make it again, I think I would definitely cut back on the meat and probably just use a lighter spaghetti sauce instead of the tomato sauce and paste.

Only made slight spice modification, and added extra cheese because I love cheese. My roommate and I devoured the entire pan.

I loved this pasta dish.   I followed the recipe exactly with the exception  of using fresh garlic instead of garlic powder.  I made the full amount but since we only ate two portions divided the rest into servings and froze them.I love dishes that I only cook once and get several meals out of.

I will make this again. I used 2 lbs. of hamburger so I increased the tomato paste to an extra 6 oz. increased the tomato sauce to an extra 14 oz. can. I also used the whole box of shells so I had to increase the filling. With that I doubled the ingredients for the filling. It was very meaty, the way my family likes it. I will definitely make this a regular for my family. It is very cheesy and saucy.

Amazing recipe. I needed two 24 oz jars of pasta sauce and used about a pound of ground beef.  I used about 2 cups ricotta cheese and 1 cup cottage cheese. I kept the spices the same for the cheese mixture but for the meat sauce I used onion powder, salt, pepper, garlic powder, basil, and cayenne pepper. This actually made enough for 35 shells.

It tasted good, but either my jumbo shells weren't as jumbo, or there was just too much stuffing. I would need to cut back by about a third, and would like it is the meat sauce was less meat and more sauce.

Used a 12oz. Box of jumbo shells...ended up being way more than 18 shells, so I ended up with 2 9x13 pans.  Used Italian sausage one big sweet onion, and 1.5 tsp. Of minced garlic in with the meat and 2 containers of the low fat ricotta cheese. Used the idea of putting the cheese mixture in a ziplock Baggie and cutting out one corner, genius! Needed 2 jars of spaghetti sauce for all those shells, split the 1 lb. of meat between the two pans.  Didn't pre-boil the shells, just added some water to the sauce and covered with foil.  Uncovered once noodles were cooked to brown up the cheese a bit.

This was a great recipe, I used minced chicken instead of beef, used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese. Instead of garlic powder I used 5-6 cloves of garlic and also used a full onion frying the garlic and onion together with some oil before adding the minced chicken in. The Ziploc bag trick didn't work for me as you have to hold and open the pasta shells with one hand and squeeze the filling into it with the other. I found it much easier to scoop the filling in with a spoon, quick fast and easy. for a cake that's on the table the Ziploc method would work wonders but if your holding the shell on the left hand and filling with the right hand it's not that simple.

Overall great recipe I would make it again it is quite something! Makes a lot of servings great leftovers.

This recipe was a great find.  It was simple to prepare and was in the oven in no time.  Quicker bake time over a pan of Lasagna and was just as good.  
I added a cup of cooked spinach to the cottage cheese mixture before stuffing the shells.  
I would make this again in a heartbeat!

This recipe was a shot in the dark for me, as I have zero experience with italian dishes. It was a fairly involved recipe for my skill level, but I gave it a shot. It turned out fantastic! I really enjoyed this dish. I served it with Baked Garlic Bread and a ceasar salad. My girlfriend and I had a bunch of leftovers and I just threw them back in the oven when we were ready to eat them. Very good, plan on making again soon. Forgot to mention, that we used fresh Ricotta cheese instead of cottage!

We really enjoyed this.  Used ricotta instead of cottage cheese.  I would recommend cooking some extra shells in case a couple tear when cooking or filling.  I may cook even more shells next time as I had about a cup of filling leftover.  I might would have preferred the sauce just a bit thinner, so I may thin it out a little next time.  But so enjoyable as-is I had to give it five stars.

I made it for me and my fiance. It was delish!!!! Only the next time I'm going to make it with 1 cup less of cottage cheese and about 1 cup less of mozzarella cheese. After I filled the pasta shells, there was a lot of the mixture left and I didn't know what to do with the extra.

After making this I've decided it doesn't stack up to regular lasagna and seems to be close to the same amount of work.  Not used to the flavor of the cottage cheese.

I did not change a thing in this recipe. This is super good and very easy to make. My family loved it. If you have a small family you may want to half the recipe it makes a lot.

This recipe was quite delicious. I altered the recipe only slightly based on what I had on hand. I only had one 8 ounce of bag of mozzarella cheese, so that is what I used. I then used a full cup of cottage cheese, and almost 3/4 cup of parmesan cheese.  Even with these slight changes, the recipe was delicious!! I also used sprinkles of oregano, Tastefully Simple garlic bread seasoning, salt, and parsley in the meat mixture. It was not necessary to measure the spices. Just pour it in. I also recommend using a good spaghetti sauce rather than tomato sauce. I used extra (actually diced tomatoes in addition to one cup of tomato sauce.)I did not have a full cup and a half of sauce, so I used one cup of spaghetti sauce, and a 16 ounce can of crushed tomatoes. Even with all the tweaking I had to do, this recipe was scrumptious!! This WILL be a staple in our house now.  UPDATE: MADE AGAIN APRIL 23d, 16.  ACCIDENTALLY USED ONLY AN 8 OUNCE BAG OF MOZZARELLA CHEESE, HAD NO ONION ON HAND, 3 CUPS OF COTTAGE CHEESE, AND ALL THE SPICES. MADE SAUCE THE WAY RECIPE CALLS FOR. I AM VERY CURIOUS TO SEE HOW THIS TURNS OUT. IT IS COOKING IN OVEN NOW....

Pretty good! I did use spaghetti sauce and added some tomato sauce to get the total amount of sauce the recipe called for. Next time i will cut down on the salt. I will probably use less meat as well but that's just personal preference.

Really good!  I did make a couple changes, but I still gave five stars because I think it would be good as is also.  First of all I used whole milk ricotta instead of cottage cheese, and used a jarred pasta sauce.  I also used ground turkey instead of beef, and threw some minced garlic in after browning.  I par boiled the shells for 8 minutes and baked for 30 after putting together and the noodles were perfectly al dente.  One of my partners favorite meals i've made!

This is excellent, and I will make it again.  I used a pound of ground beef and added more onion, and thought it needed more of the oregano and garlic powder.  I also added torn spinach into the sauce, as I had it on hand, along with a few sliced fresh mushrooms.  I cooked my whole package of jumbo shells, and ended up with three casseroles.  I did have to toss some of the cooked shells, as I ran out of the filling mixture, but there was definitely more filling than I needed for only 18 shells.  Of course, then I had to make my meat sauce last longer, so ended up putting in a portion of a jar of spaghetti sauce .. it all turned out perfect in the end.  Great recipe .. thank you!

Very tasty!  I used half sausage and half ground beef.  My grocery store did not have the large shells so I layered in a cake pan with penne pasta.  I left it in layers when I baked it but next time I would mix it up first.  I will also add some extra veggies like mushrooms and maybe spinach to increase the nutritional value.

I followed the directions and used some of the comments from other reviewers...like using ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese. The one thing I should have realized was there was too much paste. The sauce was too thick. I could have easily cut the paste by half. I also used a large can (29oz) of tomato sauce and it was still too thick. But overall it was flavorful and easy to make...just watch out trying to stuff the shells...they get a bit slippery when cooked.

I am going to give it only four stars as I changed it up too much for a full five stars.  I subbed two pounds of mild Italian sausage for the ground beef and added about 4 cloves of minced garlic and half a chopped onion to the sausage while it browned.  I also took the recommendation of other viewers and used Ricotta cheese in place of the cottage cheese.  I added maybe two cloves of minced garlic to the cheese filling as well.  Thanks for the recommendation to use a plastic bag to pipe the cheese mix into the shells.  With these changes, I'd give this recipe five stars all day long.  Definitely going to be making this again!

The version I made was great. I used bertolli red wine burgundy marinara sauce and tomato paste. I didn't have tomato sauce on hand but the marinara is a keeper!!  I also used ground turkey instead on beef, I subbed the cottage cheese for cream cheese, and I added crushed red peppers to give it a kick.  Yummers ????

I split the beef with hot Italian sausage, and this made for an excellent flavor. Outstanding leftover as well.

I was very disappointed with this receipt, I followed it  and made no changes, the sauce is too thick and too bitter, you couldn't even spread it over the shells. I did not care for the cottage cheese either, disappointed it was a lot of work and was not good. Unfortunately will not be making this again. I will go back to my own receipt. I can see why so many people changed this receipt.

Easy and popular, will make again for groups that love cheese. I used ground turkey instead of beef with some olive oil to make it a bit healthier.

I made this recipe with ground turkey instead of ground beef, and used one bottle of Newmans Own Sockarooni Sauce instead of tomato paste and sauce.  I used cottage cheese as the recipe said, and the results were wonderful. Everyone loved it. I found I had plenty of filling left over after filling 18 jumbo shells, so I will be making another batch with the excess filling.

Well it sounded good the way it was but I made changes that, to me and my family, tasted great. Instead of beef, I used half turkey and half  Italian sausage. I also used fresh herbs/spices instead of dried. I also included mushrooms, red, yellow and orange bell peppers. I also used ricotta cheese instead of cottage. I also used a variety of italian cheeses which some I bought in the "fancy" cheese section of my store, like asiago, fontina, parmesan and some other fancy italian cheeses hehe. Served it with a caeser salad and garlic bread. It must have been good, there was hardly any left. Will make this again!

the recipe is bland, but my wife and some of our friends like there meals that way. I am from the south and like a little more spiciness in my foods. I did follow your recipe, I just changed the amount of cottage cheese and  added ricotta, I didn't change the meat either. For the sauce I did spice up the tomato sauce and I added some wine to help it with flavor. I do want to say my wife loved it as it is. You have a wonderful recipe, thanks for submitting it

Good recipe! I agree with other reviewers that this is a good base recipe, with room to tweak it to your own preferences/tastes. For the most part, I used all the ingredients and the amounts as written, with exception of minced garlic instead of garlic powder. I added salt/pepper and Italian spices to the sauce, and used salt/pepper to taste in the cheese mixture. It turned out outstanding, and my family loved it and said I could make it again!

Tasty. I omitted the cottage cheese as I also served another stuffed shell dish with ricotta and spinach. I added in some mushroom and used 3 cloves of garlic. The type of tomato sauce you use will really matter in this dish. I used a Barilla tomato and basil one.

My husband loved this recipe my only change to it was the cottage cheese just didn't sound right in a pasta dish so I went w ricotta instead. I also added just a little more salt to the sauce. I personally thought the sauce was too thick but as I stated earlier my husband loved this recipe and he's a picky eater so I won't be making any more changes to it

Fantastic tastes like classic lasagna. Family loved it too. It would taste great with a spagetti sauce in a jar as well instead of making the sauce and I added cheddar cheese to the topping because it's my favorite.

This was a big success. My picky eater even went back for seconds. I did tweak the recipe by substituting ricotta for the cottage cheese. We'll be making this one again for sure.

We just got done eating dinner. We love stuffed shells at our house already, so this recipe was a real treat to our taste buds. Next time I plan to omit a small amount of the cottage cheese and replace it with some ricotta.

This is a good, solid, easy recipe. I only made a few adjustments:  I used garlic in place of garlic powder, since I had it on hand. I added basil to the cheese mixture. Like a lot of people, I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese.  I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars only because I felt that there wasn't enough sauce. Next time, I'll probably double the tomato sauce and tomato paste.

Sauce was a bit too tomato-ey, but flavor was otherwise good. Next time I might reduce or alter the tomato past ratio.

These were good!  I will cut back on the amount of tomato paste next time and substitute sauce - it was a little too thick.  I also added in more seasonings into the tomato sauce and a few cloves of chopped garlic in wtih the onions.

Very rich and filling, I followed the recipe exactly and the "sauce" was very thick which I expected with 12oz of tomato paste.  I kept think I shoud add water but the recipe did not call for any. I notice other reveiwers used their own sauce so they avoided this problem.  I have other stuffed shells recipes that I liked better so will probably not use this again.

It was really good but I made it with ricotta cheese instead as I do not like cottage cheese.  The only puzzling thing was that I ended up with lots of ricotta stuffing.  I made 32 jumbo shells and a small lasagna with the leftovers.  My family loved it.
