Made this today for Sunday dinner after church.  It was quick and easy.  I used cauliflower, carrots, broccoli and one baking potato (diced).  I had to use an additional small baking sheet for the chicken as I used too many veggies.  I would say the one thing that was missing was salt, so next time I'd definitely add some to both the chicken and the veggies.   So delicious!

I would give this 4.5 stars.  I made exactly as written, but didn't make the dipping sauce. It was delicious.  I couldn't get the chicken to brown though so will make in a broiler-proof pan next time.

My husband does not love chicken, but he really enjoyed this and asked me to make it a regular on our menu.  That is high praise.  I did change one thing. I used fresh parsley because I do not use dried parsley.  I would add more herbs to the recipe. Also, would make way more veggies because we loved them.

Recipes always take me longer than written.   With veggie prep, I figured on 1 hr 10 minutes, and that's about how long it took me.  I didn't have red potatoes so used a sweet potato.  Also added a diced butternut squash.  I'll increase the green beans.  I think this would also be good with cubed zucchini and whole mushrooms.  I loved the chicken.  Crispy, tasty coating, juicy and tender on the inside.  My hubby liked the vegetables.  I didn't have seasoned salt, and I forgot the garlic(!) so I'm sure it'll taste better next time.  I had to use two baking sheets, so with both pans in the (convection) oven, my veggies seemed a little mushy.  But everything did get cooked at the same time, in 30".  Forgot to make the dipping sauce(!) so will try that next time, too.

We loved the chicken - finally found an oven baked recipe where the breading actually tastes crispy! My family is not a big fan of these veggies and the sauce sounded odd, so we ignored that portion of the recipe. I comboe'd it with a lemon cream sauce, spinach, and angel hair pasta. (My kids had jarred spaghetti sauce.) 5 stars for the chicken!

I made it exactly as listed.  Chicken was tender, flavorful.  Veggies overwhelmed by the garlic (a tablespoon is a lot!) and needed a little more time than the chicken, which was timed exactly as written, 10 min., flip, 15 min. more.  I didn't make the dipping sauce but will make it for the tenders next time.  I'll either cook some veggies separately, without the spice mix, or put one or two on the sheet pan, with just oil, salt and cracked pepper.

I followed the recipe to the letter.    The chicken was very moist and had a wonderful flavor.   However, you will have to play around with cooking times/your oven to make it turn out crispy.   The vegetables needed more time to cook but we did not care for the combination or for the seasoning on the vegetables-personal preference.

Delicious!  I didn’t have panko, so blended a couple of old bread slices.  Didn’t use extra Parmesan.  Added fresh chives with veggies.
I probably will try this again, without any Flour, crumbs or, butter....just the great combination of spices and, herbs.
Thank you!

Great recipe! I did add 5 minutes more cooking time to get the bread crumbs crispy. I also added a bit more garlic and worcestashire sauce to make it more savory.

I put all veggies in a large bowl to mix with seasoning. The veggies were not as crisp as I hoped, so next time I will put the veggies in the oven for 5-10 minutes before adding the chicken. The flavors were great!

Pretty good.  Didn't make the same vegetables; used sweet potatoes and carrots and added dried basil and onion powder to the carrots, nothing to the sweet potatoes.  Added a bit of butter to the vegetables once plated.  I didn't have  enough mayonnaise to make the dipping sauce, but I don't usually use one anyway.  The chicken cooked very nicely and was crispy.

The whole family lived this recipe! I like that it doesn't involve frying the chicken. I've made the veggies a couple of times now as a side dish that the whole family enjoys!

My family loved it. I made double portions of the chicken and made chicken parmigiana with it. This also came out good.

The flavor was delicious and the chicken was very good. My husband and I like the veggies a little softer. These came out a little hard but the flavor and spices gave it a delicious taste. We did not use potato because we made mashed potatoes with it   Also I did not have red peeper and I used green peppet

This is delicious, but (to me) labor intensive. These kind of recipes that have steps rather than separate Ingredients / Directions...!  So I will re-write it  that makes more sense to me and make it again. Just my idiosyncrasy. 

Since I didn't have parsley, I used tarragon and for seasoned salt, I used my homemade steak seasoning.  It was great. I actually forgot to make/use the sauce, and when I told my husband he said, "This dish is better than a ketchup / mayonnaise sauce!"  Ha.

Made this almost exactly as the recipe stated only more potatoes (5 large russets), doubled the chicken and used thighs. Still used 1 lb of veggies each and 1 large yellow pepper. This dinner was an absolute hit with everyone. The chicken was so crisp and tasty and reminded me of a dinner I ordered at a very expensive restaurant. I will definitely make this again for guests and the family too. Most yummy!!

The good: Only one heat source needs to be used. The breading was very good flavor thanks to the parmesan and the chicken was not dried out. The veggies were good and there are lots of them.

The drawbacks:Took me twice as long to make this, so almost two hours and it stll wasn't very crispy; lots of dishes, and too much oregano made the veggies a little bitter. Could use more salt. 

I didn't bother with the dipping sauce. 

The fixes: Use half of the oregano and replace the other half with basil, or just use basil. Use two baking pans so you can broil the chicken at the end to get more crispiness  on the chicken without burning the veggies. Also, I might cover the veggies for the first half of cooking to prevent drying out.  Plan on it taking twice as long. 

Not sure if I will make it again.

Family Loved used drumsticks instead of breasts. Dipped in egg instead of flour.  Baked for 45 minutes at 400 degrees. Will definitely make again.

Loved this recipe and have made it several times now.  My kids like it, my husband likes it, and me being gluten-free can eat it with a few small changes. I muse gluten-free flour and gluten-free breadcrumbs.  I have tried a few different brands of gluten-free and found that Aleias original real panko works best (found it in my gluten-free section of my local grocery store). I also refrigerated container of mixed vegetables in the produce aisle which makes it super easy. This is on my weekly menu!

The chicken was delicious and tender with the right amount of crispness.  The next time I make this dish I will cut the green beans and potatoes a bit smaller so everything bakes more evenly.

All agreed this was a five star dinner.  Stayed true to the recipe, except left out  the broccoli florets and some of the garlic .  Next time will include everything.  Would add a photo but it’s all gone!

Super tasty recipe.  I made it with sweet potatoes and green beans.  I liked cutting the chicken into strips because it made for more breading. The dipping sauce was pretty good.  I didn’t enjoy it with the chicken.  The chicken was so tasty in its own that it didn’t need the dipping sauce.  The sauce was good with the sweet potatoes though.    However, I still prefer mayo and bbq sauce, but it was a good experiment.  The chicken was crispy, juicy, and bursting with flavor.  Great recipe!

We did not care for this.  Too much oregano and too much breading for our taste.  Won't make it again.

Not a fan! Too heavy on the breadcrumbs and veggies were overdone by the time the chicken was cooked.

This worked like a charm - the vegetables were amazing - nice flavor and cooked soft enough. I used cauliflower, broccoli, onions, squash and fresh green beans.

I made it for friends, and it was a hit. I used seasoned Panko breadcrumbs which made the process a bit simpler. I also added sliced zucchini to the veggie mix. Seasoning for vegetables was excellent.

It’s nothing more than a variation of chicken nuggets.  And, it makes for a lot of dishes.  Hoped it would have had more flavor.  If it hadn’t been for the vegetables, it would really have been disappointing.

Bit disappointed.  Prep time and cook time
a lot  longer .  Although I microwaved the potato 2 minutes  before dicing, still were not cooked and nothing was as crispy as advertised.  Very tasty and attractive dish but needs some corrections.

Great recipe! Healthy enough and a very nice chicken dinner. Tasty and looks very appetizing. I made the veggie with just fresh broccoli, no other veggies. Simple prep, easy cleanup, and a tasty fine dinner. i made a simple side of plain quinoa to go with it. I liked how the chicken and the veggie cooked the same amount of time and on 1 baking sheet. Everyone enjoyed the dinner very much. I'll definitely make again.

Everything was fine except the dipping sauce (yuck!). I heated up some good quality pasta sauce mixed with red wine and that worked very well as a sauce with this dish.

Maybe total time in the oven was closer to 45-50 minutes? The chicken was good, potatoes were still a little crunchy when we finally ate.

This is a wonderful recipe! I made it as is. It’s quick, easy and can be made with whatever vegetables you have in your refrigerator. I mixed the dry ingredients the day before, which really cut down the prep time.  I will definitely make this again.

I made this as written with the exception of using gluten free panko. My family enjoyed the chicken but the veggies were another story. There was something missing. We thought roasted cherry tomates would have been a perfect addition.
