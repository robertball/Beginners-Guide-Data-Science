we are going to keep this, it's basically a lemon bar with something more, that makes it less "homey" and even good to serve when you have company. I followed the directions to a T, but for the sugar over the top (it was way too much). The chocolate didn't melt completely, but we liked it that way as well. Next time I'm goimg to double the lemon layer, and see what happens: I'm sure it will add tartness and character to the whole thing.

Very sweet, even though I didn’t use a full cup of confectioner’s sugar for the topping.  Do let the bars cool completely to get a good/even cut on the bars.  I cut them too soon, and they  were a little crumbly (that’s my mistake).   That layer of chocolate chips does not melt completely, and although these are very tasty, they’re just a bit on the sweet side for me.  I’ll probably stick with the more traditional lemon bar which has a bit more tartness to it.

These are sweet but I have quite the sweet tooth so they were perfect for me!  I made these for a Father's Day BBQ and everyone liked them.  I used a little more white chocolate chips than called for and a lot less confectioner's sugar(maybe 1 or 2 Tablespoons).  I don't have a sifter so I just took a pinch at a time and spread it over the top.  So so good!  Can't wait to have another reason to make these again.....I'm thinking we need to BBQ again this weekend!

These are a little bit too sweet.  I like a little more tartness in my lemon bars.  Next time I will cut back on the sugar.
Very easy to make.

Made the recipe exactly as is, and it turned out really well. The only ingredient I didn't use in the given amount was the confectioner's sugar. (Only added a light sprinkle as I didn't want the sweetness to overwhelm the lemon flavour.) Definitely a keeper - thank you!

A theater company I am involved with has a dessert auction fundraiser every year. Last year I made these  and they got auctioned Off for 65 dollars.  The woman who got them said they were the most incredible lemon bars she has ever had. I have made them for many other functions since and the get eaten really fast. This recipe is a real keeper.  If you like lemon bars please try this recipe.

I made this just as it was written. They came out delicious. My brother would have ate the whole pan if his diet would have let him!

I just don't care for the white chocolate in this recipe. It's an awkward texture and really takes away from the tartness of the bar. I don't think I'll be making it again.

It was a complete success and a hit with everyone. I made this a year ago and people keep bugging me to make it.

No changes made to the recipe. I don't have a 9 inch square dish, so the first batch was in a 7X10 dish and the second was in an 8X11 (about). Both came out delicious and perfect. The smaller dish required a bit more time.
