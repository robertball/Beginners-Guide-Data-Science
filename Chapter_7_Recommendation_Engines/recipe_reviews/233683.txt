Wonderful Salmon... My family rates All food when tried for the first time...Ok, Don't make again, and Make for Company...This Salmon was rated Make for Company...Instead of using a Granulated Garlic... I used Fresh Minced Garlic in the jar and instead of using fresh Lemon Zest...I used McCormick California Lemon Peel plus instead of Plain Bread Crumbs I used Lemon Pepper Panko Bread Crumbs....Absolutly wonderful Salmon with Mashed Potatoes and Stem Broccoli....

Too much thyme for our tastes - it over powered the lemon pepper seasoning and not enough garlic. I used only 2.5 tablespoons of panko bread crumbs and that was more than enough.  There are other salmon recipes we prefer but will probably have this one again (with less thyme and more garlic) when we're in the mood for something different.

We love this recipe. We do add more garlic, but that's about the only change. It's great!

Great awesome crunch on the outside. I put mine on broil right at the end for some more color. You won't be disappointed!

It's my second time using this recipe. The first time I made it, I did it with Salmon and my husband loved it. I made it again tonight, but used flounder since its all we had. It was delicious, even my picky daughter gave it a thumbs up.  How can you go wrong with panko?!

This is a great and easy to cook recipe.  We added some asparagus in the same pan with 10 minutes to go. 

For and extra kick, we rubbed some adobo sauce on the fish before adding the Panko Crumbs.

Very nice herb additions.  I used a couple drops of essential lemon oil and the salmon turned out delicious!  I also broiled it at the end.

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out wonderfully. It was delicious! Two of my three kids loved it! (It doesn’t get any better than that at my house.)

This was excellent!  The only thing I did differently was added a little extra garlic.  Definitely making it again...even my picky husband loved it!

I made this for the family tonight.  Delish.  Easy and fast. Even kids liked it.  I think for those that have trouble with flavor on salmon dishes need to consider the  quality of the salmon they are using.  Ours was fresh caught, wild.  Every bit of it was moist and flavorful.  We added fresh lemon zest instead of dried and also a bit of salt.  A great topping. Will make this again!

It had way too much bread crumb topping, had a "powder" consistency on top and no flavor. The small amount of topping that was able to absorb the juices from the salmon had a mushy texture.I had to scrape the topping off. Luckily, I had a marinade to dunk it in to add some flavor and salvage the dinner. I would give it a zero if I could.
