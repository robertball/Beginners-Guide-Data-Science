I ended up braising the ribs in my oven at 300 degrees for about 2 hours and then put them on the BBQ with the sauce for about 15 minutes.  Delicious!  If you don't want to worry about them on the BBQ, the oven is the way to go.

Very good recipe. I made the ribs in the oven at 300 degrees for three hours then put the bbq sauce on them for an hour.  Finished them off by removing the foil just to expose the ribs under a low broiler for a few mins.  I will make this again for sure.

These ribs were fantastic.  My family and I agreed that these were probably the best ribs we had ever had.  I cooked the ribs uncovered in the oven @ 325 for 2 hours and finished them off on the bbq with the sauce for about 10-15 min.  Excellent!!  This will be our rib recipe of choice from now on - thanks for sharing this one.

these were good! My BBQ died 1/2 way through, so I wrapped them tightly in foil and baked them in the oven set at 300, brushed BBQ sauce on them and broiled them a bit to finish 'em off. They were so good my daughter who is ultra picky loved them, and my husband said they were good enough to convert a vegetarian!

We just committed the 3rd deadly sin, GLUTTONY!  WOW, these ribs are sooo good.  My husband, a confirmed rib hater, loved them.  

I did mine in a roaster in the oven at 325 for a couple of hours, lid off for the last hour, an additional 15-20 mins with the sauce and they turned out just perfectly!

Oh my Gosh! I needed this recipe because I am making these for the second time (in just three weeks), and I thought I had better make sure and tell anyone, master griller or not, that these ribs are what all these reviews say they are, YUM!  So if you are looking for a delicious-and easy- recipe for ribs, you've found them.

Do not change a thing about the seasonings for this recipe. Right on the taste buds. Everything plays against each other in the most wonderful way. Cooked as suggested on the grill, yes, very, very good. Am keeping this rub in my kitchen all year long. Perfect combination.

My husband and 3 yr old daughter both loved this.  Just the right about of spice.  I didn't have onion powder and celery salt but did have caesar drink rimmer, so used that.

Fixed this for father's day - kind of risky trying a new recipe for this occasion.  It was fabulous!!!!  We really liked the ingredients, so we went for it - and I would highly recommend this recipe to anyone.  It was easy easy easy (and I need easy).

These are the best!  You can taste all of the different ingredients in the rub.  Delicious.  I grilled them at 400 degrees on indirect heat for about one hour and 45 minutes.  I was worried with the honey and sugar that they would be too sweet but they were not.  They were pure perfection.

This is my first try at ribs....delicious! My boys thought they were yummy, too, the real test! I baked in the oven as some other reviewers suggested...300 degrees for 3 hours. I would cover for the first hour next time. Thanks!

I had made this for my father's birthday. I admitt i was a little weary trying a new recipe on such a day, but it was amazing. It was just enough sweet and a little spice. You could definatly taste each spice added. This recipe is also great with beef ribs too.

These were the best ribs I've ever had and were soooo easy to make.  The only thing I did different was I did mine in the oven at 325 degrees for 2 1/2 hours.  Even my pickiest eater in the family loved them!

Ok my family just about turned caveman over this recipe.  an entire rack of ribs gone in about 10 mins.  I cut the recipe to 2 servings for my 1 rack of ribs.  rubbed every inch with the spice mixture and cooked on the grill for 65 mins @ 350.  No turning.  At 45 mins i basted one side with with honey and BBQ sauce.  Then again at 55 mins.  the rested for about 10 mins and all heck broke loose.  I have never seen my wife eat like this before.  Yum Yum!

Used this rub on a pork loin roast and let sit for 24 hours.  Seared on BBQ and finished cooking in the oven.  Everyone loved it, gone in a flash.  Thanks.

Having lived in KC, I just had to check this recipe out!  I was not disappointed!  These were by far, the best ribs I have ever made.  I slow-roasted them at 275 for 4 hours, then finished them off on the grill (low), basting at least once with BBQ sauce, for 15 min.  Delicious!!

Super Ribs! Our oven is broke so I put the dry rub in a stock pot with water and boiled the ribs for 1 1/2 hrs then grilled. Wow! this was so good we kept the broth and used it to make boneless ribs again. Awesome! Awesome!

Da bomb!!!! Perfect pork loin ribs. Removed membrane from the bone side. Applied a mustard slather on both sides of rack as a bonding agent for the rub. Smoked for 4-3/4 hrs. on Big Green Egg at 225°-240°, turning once (use the BGE plate setter for indirect heat). Used apple & oak whiskey barrel wood chips. Mopped barbeque glaze (used Big Al's K.C. Bar-B-Q Sauce from this site) on ribs, and cooked another 20 minutes. The low-and-slow cook infused a wonderful smoky flavor, and the combination of an outstanding rub and a great BBQ sauce took these ribs to another level. The ribs were very moist and tender. Paul Kirk, your recipe is the work of a champion pitmaster!

This became an instant family favorite the first time we tried it. I put the ribs in the over under the broiler on low for about an hour and fifteen min., turning and basting halfway through and then basting again 15 min. before they were done.  The ribs are perfect everytime!

These were absolutely amazing! I served these up at a barbeque yesterday and they were quite the crowd pleaser. I decided to spice things up a bit and throw a little bit of Alaskan Amber into the marinade...great addition!

this got great reviews from my family.  the only thing I did different was pre-boil the ribs because they were a bit fatty, then I added the rub, then the bbq mix, then broiled it & they were tender & juicy, spicy & surprisingly, the honey didn't make the bbq too sweet

WOW! This was the best recipe ever for a BBQ rub. I combined this with the BBQ sauce recipe . I also followed the cooking directions for this recipe for the ribs. I suggest rib racks.

Oh sooooo good!!  These were sinful!!!  I didn't have any ground mustard so I just left that out.  Didn't have any celery salt either but did have celery seed...so I just grinded the seeds to powder form and it seemed to work out great.  Can't wait to make these again!!

I made this recipe today for Father's Day. It was wonderful. Even my picky grandson came up to me and gave me a hug for the ribs. I followed the recipe to the letter and it was very easy.

OH MY GOD!  I’ve used many recipes from this site and others but this is the only one that has compelled me to comment on.  I poured all of the dry ingredients as written in an old mayonnaise jar and shook them until everything blended together.  I coated my spare ribs thoroughly Sunday morning, covered them in a baking dish with aluminum foil and let them sit overnight.  Monday, I took them out of the fridge and let them sit on the counter until the over pre-heated to 325 degrees (to cold outside to use grill).  I then placed them into the oven for 1 hr. bone side up.  I turned them over (meat side up), re-covered them and placed them back in for 1 hr.  I then prepared the BBQ sauce and let sit until the ribs finished cooking.  I then removed the foil, coated the ribs with the BBQ sauce (used ¾ of sauce) and placed them back into the oven uncovered for ½ hr.  After 20 mins. I re-coated ribs with the remaining ¼ BBQ sauce.  WOW!!!  My wife, who rarely eats red meat, complimented these ribs.  She took leftovers for lunch the next day.  Her co-workers asked about her lunch due to the smell these ribs left behind.  Will use this rub from now on.

Best spareribs we ever ate!  Cooked them in 325 F oven for 2 hours, then put Big Al's K.C. Bar-B-Q sauce from this site, and barbecued for 15 minutes.  Perfect!!!!

Okay!! First time I've ever made ribs, and these were awesome!  Husband even said "best I've ever had", I think he may be a little overboard, but hey he's eaten some ribs in his day.  I just watched episode of DDD's and tried leaving the silver skin on one rack... really could tell the moisture stayed in better than the others. I'll be making these many times in future I know allready.

I made these ribs for a family gathering. The rub tasted great when I sampled it before putting in on the ribs. After they cooked and the BBQ sauce was on, all I tasted was the sauce. I think that next time I will add some crushed red pepper or cayenne to give it a kick.

Awesome! This was my first time making ribs. I followed the rub recipe exactly, except that I didn't have any sage. As some others suggested, I baked them in the oven at 300, covered with tin foil for 2 hours, then uncovered for 1 hour. Then I brushed them with the barbeque, honey combination, cooked them 15 minutes, turned and brushed again and cooked them for 15 minutes more. (A total of 3 1/2 hours at 300.) I did 3 full racks of baby back ribs. They were restaurant quality. Yum. I will be making these again.

Wonderful and just what I wanted to make our pork ribs delicious. My husband wanted a dry rub for pork ribs. We loved the flavor of the ribs, not too spicy, but a bit of a kick and not over powering.  I didn't use all of the rub seasoning for the ribs, but I am sure the rub will be used the next time I make ribs.

Very good. Great flavour in the rub.  I put the rub on, let the ribs sit for an hour in the fridge then wrapped them in foil and baked them for 2 hrs. at 300F.  I then smoked them for about 40 minutes with mesquite wood chips.  I used store bought BBQ sauce with the honey and it was good.  I think next time I will use a homemade BBQ sauce.

This recipe was SO GOOD that I had to make an allrecipes.com account to review it! I cook a lot and let me tell you, I've never had ribs so good, not even when my mom made them back in the day. This is such a simple, easy recipe. I didn't create the rub precisely as written, I used a mix from a local farm in my neighborhood. For the sauce, I used Trader Joe's BBQ sauce (the Texas style I think), and omg omg omg, it was sooo good I picked the ribs up by hand and ate every last morsel. My husband ate so fast that the moment I blinked, the ribs were gone. TRY this recipe! Next time I will definitely try the rub in the recipe.

i don't like ribs.. but i make them for my family. They smelled AMAZING.. and i even ate a few. SO GOOD! I lowered the sugar.. but, our honey is pretty sweet. There are layers of flavour. I cooked them in the oven wrapped in foil (325) for 2 hours (flipped half way through). Then broiled with the sauce on.. 4 min each side.

I'm rating this on the flavor of the ingredients only. I had a 2.5 pound pork roast to work with that I wanted to make pulled pork with. I cut the dry rub ingredients back to two servings, but I followed EXACTLY (didn't leave anything out). I generously coated the roast with the rub, but still had quite a bit leftover. I put it in my slow cooker with NO added liquid for probably 7 hours on low. It produced a lot of liquid. I skimmed the fat off the liquid and cooked it down on the stove and then added the BBQ sauce and honey. I shredded the meat and added it to the sauce mixture and simmered until I was satisfied with it. Wow. We all agreed that it was the best pulled pork we have EVER had. That dry rub is AWESOME and I'll be using it on everything now. Looking forward to trying the ribs when the weather warms up and I can dig my grill out. Absolutely amazing.

OMG - Best ribs ever!  Two hours in the smoker with that fabulous rub and then switched to the grill for the BBQ sauce/honey step.  I used Cattleman's Carolina Gold Tangy BBQ Sauce - they were perfect!

I have made this countless times for friends and famiy - a sure thing, especially as I am a little nervous cooking for company - they even stacked up against my husband's side of the family!  I like to add the rub early and let it sink in. Other than that, follow and the recipe and it will be a hit!

This is my favorite rib recipe, and I've gotten tons of compliments from friends and neighbors every time I make them.  I keep the dry rub on hand at all times for pork chops, chicken, basically anything that goes on the grill.

I do the ribs in foil as suggested in the reviews. I then finish them on the grill with BBQ sauce. Unbelievable. This is the perfect rub. I use the rub on my whole chicken in the oven... Also unbelievable. Do it. You will be amazed. My chicken recipe is- put rub on, 475 for 15 minutes, drop to 350. Cook until finished (usually 45 minutes more for my size bird). Yummmmm

Very enjoyable.  I followed someone else's advice and baked these in the oven for  2 to 2 1/2 hours (until tender when you insert a fork in the meat) at 300 degrees.  Then I added the bbq sauce and finished these on the grill.  I also used more bbq sauce than was stipulated in the recipe.  The ribs were very tasty and rather easy to make.

Great recipe!  My family loved it!  I actually tossed everything in the recipe in the pan, including the bbq sauce and cooked it for a couple of hours.  I then pulled them out of the oven and grilled them for a bit to give them a more smokey flavor.  They were tender and full of flavor.

Always a hit with me and my husband. We have an Inferred Grill so it don't take nearly as long, so I will cook them in the oven for an hour before placing on the grill for 20-30 minutes. Then they won't burn.

Wow! Easy for my first experience with ribs; I was even out of sage and onion powder and they were still delicious! Everyone loved them, stating they "were the best ribs" they've ever had! Thanks for sharing!

Excellent. I braise with 1/2 cup of chicken broth. Cover with foil for 2 hrs @ 300 deg. Then bbq with spicy bbq sauce for my husband and applebutter sauce for myself. Fantastic! !

This is the best rub I have ever used. No matter who has my ribs, one thing we all agree on - excellent foundation rub.

My husband (a Very, Very picky eater) raved about these ribs, even went so far as to say he would like them again sometime.

This recipe is VERY good.  Did not change a thing.  Watch cooking times, Ribs should not fall off the bone.  We used Sweet Baby Ray's Regular BBQ sauce and honey for the glaze on the BBQ.  If you like less spicy, reduce amount of chill powder.

Found a great deal on rib tips. Used this recipe for the rub and glaze and they were wonderful. Foil wrapped and oven roasted at 300 degrees for 1 1/2 hours. Uncovered and glazed with sauce for 30 minutes. Then under the broiler for a few minutes to caramelize the glaze.

This recipe is really good!  The only thing I didn't have was celery salt, I just omitted it, and still thought the rub was excellent.  I didn't grill them though, I cooked them in the oven wrapped in foil at 300 degrees for 2 hours.  They were absolutely delicious.  Step 2 doesn't have to come before step 3.  I just did up the BBQ Sauce (Trader Joe's BBQ worked really well) and honey right before I put it on.  I think you could probably sub brown sugar for white sugar, I bet that would be good.  I don't think the rub needs quite as much sugar as called for.  My kids ate up these ribs.  Definitely 5 stars.

These were spectacular!  Had to use oven, then broiled the sauce for 2-min per side.  Truly, a great recipe. Don't miss these ribs.
