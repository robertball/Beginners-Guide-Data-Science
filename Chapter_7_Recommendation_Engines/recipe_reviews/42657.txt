Very good recipe. I followed the directions on my first dish, but with the 2nd I had to make several revisions. I doubled the sauce, I added more chopped garlic, cooked it in my favorite chardonnay, (use your favorite white wine) and cooked it to a reduction, (about 15 mins on high) I put in the chopped tomatos and cooked it for 4-5 mins before adding in the mussels and covering the pot with a lid, 5 mins into the mussels cooking I threw in the green onions and parsley, stirred it around and covered it for an additional 5 mins before it was done. 
I found that if you added the green onions, parsley and tomato too soon like the recipe calls for, you lose the flavor of all. In adding the veggies close to serving it keeps all of the natural flavors in. 
Great recipe.

Best mussels we ever had!  This was the first time I made mussels and was a little nervous.  They ended up dazzling us and we both agreed they were better than any restaurant's.  So, I had to do a little research, but here's what I learned (after I had to throw away about 25% of the mussels I bought).  As a rookie, I didn't realize you have to 'air' out the mussels- as in, keep them cold but make sure they get air.  I looked up how to debeard them (you can find it on this site).  As for the recipe itself, sooooo good!  I would add a few extra tomatoes and don't skip the 'salt to taste' step (I forgot and it was better with a little bit of salt).  Serve with the crustiest bread you can find and drink the wine as you cook :-)

Absolutely delicious! I doubled the sauce and served over linguini, and I highly recommend serving it this way.  I also add a little more garlic than is called for.

Very good- I doubled the ingredients for the sauce and used about 35 mussels.  Also, I replaced the chopped roma tomatoes with a can of fire roasted diced tomotoes to add another layer of depth to the flavor.  Just a hint to those new at handling mussels- there is a very good chance that if you purchase "farmed" mussels, which are sold in most grocery stores, that they ill have already been debearded.  I spent a panicked hour researching this on the net because I could not find the beards to remove. :)

Of all the mussels recipes, I trusted this one and was not steered wrong!  It was amazing, I did substitute one can of diced tomatoes for the 3 plum tomatoes and it was delicious, lots of compliments from my guests!  Thanks!

Awesome recipe! I had never prepared mussels before and these were really simple. I was hoping to duplicate a mussels recipe that a local restaurant makes and this one was REALLY close. I just felt the sauce was lacking a flavor... next time I will double the garlic and add some chicken stock to the wine, maybe add some more tomato. This will be made often and tweaked to my personal tastes. Thank you!

This was absolutely amazing and better than the mussels at my favorite restaurant!! I only made some slight variations in the recipe based on what others had recommended: 8 cloves of minced garlic, 3 tbsp butter, 1 1/2c white wine (I used a good chardonnay), and about half a pint of chopped cherry tomatoes instead of the roma tomatoes. I also followed the instructions from another review and added the parsley (I used fresh italian parsley) and onions the last five minutes of cooking. I also think that using fresh mussels is key...and as others have mentioned, be sure to have some good bread because the sauce is amazing!! I will definitely be making this on a regular basis!!

Wow!  Delicious!  I subbed sherry for the wine, yellow onion, a 1/2 14 oz can diced tomatoes because it's all I had in the house and added a splash of half-n-half.  Outstanding.  I will make it the same way next time!

Delicious!  I've tried a few other recipes for mussels but this one's a keeper.  I'm not a big fan of green onions so I used a chopped shallot instead.  These are as good as any I've had in a restaurant.  I'll be making these again and again.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was brilliant! My girlfriend loved it as well. She suggested kicking it up a notch by adding a little spicy flavor which I will try next the next time I cook this meal again.

I cannot express just how good, how easy, and how addaptable this recipe is! It's always a little different depending what i have on hand. I buy the frozen mussels at "big box store".I think its a 2lb bag, with two bags inside. Each interior bag feeds two. I decided to make it into a simple pasta dish. First,put on a pot of boiling water for the pasta. I used angel hair and seasoned mine with tomato bullion. Gives the pasta not only a great flavor, but a great color. Started with a half of a small diced onion, sauteed that in olive oil till transparent. Added all the garlic, sauteed just for a minute longer. Then dumped in an entire can of petite diced tomatos (just using what i had on hand and for quickness factor), juice and all. Also, i added the zest and juice from half a lemon. And seasoned with garlic salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes too taste. I didn't have green onions on hand last night, but they are great too. This is also a good time to chop a couple of mushrooms and throw those in too if you have them. Then once this starts to get bubbly i add the wine and the parsley. Let this simmer and reduce by half, uncovered. Once done i then put my pasta on to boil, as it only takes about six minutes. I dump the mussels in the sauce, and cover. It says about ten minutes. When the pasta is done, i drain it, then throw it in the pan with the sauce and mussels to let it absord a bit on the sauce. Then Serve! And you will be very pleased!!!

YUM! I was at McCormick and Schmidts for happy hour last week and they had these amazing mussels. The only difference was unsweetened coconut milk....I added a can and followed the recipe to a tee! THE BEST! Try adding the coconut milk...I was drinking the broth like soup!

These were wonderful!  It was my first time to make mussels, and I will definitely be making them again!  Adding the green onions and tomatoes at the end was key, as others suggested.  If I hadn't done that, they would have been mushy.  I served these with "Insalata Caprese II" (on this site), plus some crusty bread.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were good but didn't wow me. Be sure to let the mussels soak for more than 20 minutes as ours were still gritty.

A great quick dinner and a great basic sauce for a mussels dish. I used an inexpensive chardonnay. Pair with linguini, a thin spaghetti or, just crusty bread. 

I only used about 35 mussels, for 4 servings (with pasta). As other commenters have said, I would double the sauce ingredients, because of the reduction, there's just not much sauce left for sopping up with the bread.  Double: the garlic (and then maybe add 3 more cloves), the wine, butter, tomatoes and onion. 

The parsley seems enough.  Do add the onions and parsley in the last 5 min or so and save a little to add as garnish.

I think my dissatisfaction with tis recipe could be chalked up to user error. The mussels were perfectly cooked but the broth was too "sharp". I used a pinot grigio as that was what we had on hand and the flavor never mellowed out. Maybe I needed to cook longer or use a Chardonnay?

Awesome, easy, made with whatever we had in the cupboard.  No tomatoes, dried parsley, red onion instead of green.  Hard to wrong w/ butter, white wine and garlic.  I personally like making these white wine sauces w/ sauvignon blanc.  Bought a baguette to dip in the sauce, toasted it and went to town.  Great dish for sharing.

AWESOME!! I doubled the recipe. Instead of 2 cups of wine I did 1 1/4 cup wine and 3/4 cup of chicken broth. I added 2 bay leafs, some basil, dash of red peppers and I put it over linguini. Even my 4 yr old loved this one!!

What a bummer!  The sauce that got rave reviews was very bland-the parsley looked like spinich in the dish, colored the broth green and added no flavor by the time the mussels were opened-Will not ever use this one again..

I made this for a large dinner gathering, and my friend from the northern coast of France actually told me that these were the best mussels she's ever had!  What a compliment to the recipe, and I can't wait to make it again.

This was a great dish!  We add extra garlic because the flavor is so good!  We also add some chicken stock to give it more juice for sopping with bread.  Thanks for sharing!

ALCOHOL substitution - for those who don't imbibe, I susbstituted 1 cup of apple juice plus 1 TBLS. of balsamic vinegarfor the wine and the flavor was fabulous. Just a wonderful recipe served with fresh French bread for sopping up the wonderful sauce. These are the best I have made by far. Thank you Patti!

Awesome recipe for any mussel lover out there. I added some thinly sliced red peppers, a handful of mushrooms and some fresh basil to the mix prior to dropping in the mussels. Add a fresh french baguette, some wine and you're set. Thanks Patti :)

I`ve made this recipe at least 5 times now, and I`m always thrilled with it. It`s really versatile and I often use it as a base for cooking other seafood dishes.  I tend to add sliced leek in with the garlic and sweat them for a few minutes longer than the recipe suggests. I also like to use a bit of extra wine. At the point where you add the mussels, I like to throw a few peices of cod or sole at the bottom, followed by some prawns, then the mussels on top. That was the mussels steam nicely out of the sauce, and you get a great seafood dish that is amazing over pasta! Love this recipe!

I followed the recipe except that I doubled the sauce, garlic, and added the tomatoes towards the end as suggested in other reviews and it was very good.  I usually don't like mussels that much (made if for husband) but loved them this way.  The sauce goes great with whole wheat pasta.

LOVE this recipe! I make it all the time, usually with crusty bread or over pasta and every time it's delicious. The sauce is great, I do usually add a few more tomatoes.

The are the BEST. My roommate told me she felt like she was eating at a fancy restaurant, that's how good they were. SO easy and SO fast. And SO good. I added a few drops of tobasco to give it a bit of kick but otherwise they are perfect. I urge you to make these ASAP and impress the heck out of someone tonight!

Oh my gosh! These were sooooo good! I usually dislike it when people give good ratings then talk about the changes they made, but I have to be honest and say that I had to leave out the tomatoes because of one of my guests. I can't wait to make them again with the tomatoes! Either way, this recipe rocks. Make sure you have lots of bread to soak up the broth! (we doubled the broth recipe for this purpose)

The basic ingredients were quite good, although it needed something more. I ended up following some of the other reviewers in adding more garlic and some chicken broth (2/3 of can) to add more sauce. I also added an extra tablespoon of butter to compensate for the additional chicken broth. To add that extra "taste," I added two cans of chopped clam in clam juice (make sure to use to the clam juice). Adding extra parsley also helps to make it spicier. For those who like eating it with linguini, the twist is to add a few drops of lemon/lime into the sauce, and you'll see the difference...

This is a decent base for mussels. Needs cream and something else, paprika or saffron or some other strong-tasting spice.

I have tried a creamy white wine base mussel dish at a french - american restaurant and now i have moved away from the city, I have been craving it so much that I have been looking for a lot of different recipes just to replicate the good memories.. and I FOUND IT! I have followed all the exact same ingredients and steps in this recipe and enjoyed my meal with some french baguette to dip in the mussel a la creme juice.. oh so good! The mussel juice got cold really quick and the cream has separated .. I had the microwave the mussel juice again just because it taste much better when it is served hot/warm. I almost drink it like soup! AMAZING! will use this recipe again!

Awesome recipe! I made only a few changes- I halved the recipe, used clams instead of mussels, diced canned tomatoes at the beginning instead of fresh, and smart balance rather than butter. I let the sauce reduce a couple times before adding the clams in (canned tomatoes develop more flavor with reduction- fresh tends to LOSE flavor when cooked too much). My one word of advice is to be careful not to salt to taste before the clams are in. You want to go for a more bland salting, as the clams/mussels will add a lot of salt to the final dish. I completely forgot about this fact, and had to dish only a minute amount of the sauce over the 'risotto a la Milanese'(my  Nonna's recipe), and leave the clams dry when they were scooped out. Still had an amazing flavor though!

Any time I try a recipe, I ALWAYS follow to a "T" before changing anything.  The first time through, it ended up missing the variance of flavors I knew existed in the dish.  So the second time in I followed another reviewer's advice.  It's worth mentioning again.  First I doubled the sauce, I also added an extra clove of garlic.  Next, since I was doubling, I added about a 1/4 cup of chicken stock.  If you don't double, add an 1/8 cup.  I let the garlic, stock, wine, and butter cook to a reduction on high for about 10-15 minutes.  After that, I reduced the heat a little and added the tomatoes.  A word on the tomatoes here, a) don't chop them too small or they will cook to nothing, b) do NOT strain the juices and seeds.  Throw it all in there with the reduction.  After the tomatoes have cooked with the mix for about 3-5 minutes, I added the mussels, cover the pot with a lid and toss the mix every minute or so.  Don't shake the pot too hard or your crack shells.   Five minutes in to cooking the mussels, I added the onion.  Lid back on, tossing continues.  Two to three minutes later, throw in the parsley and salt and pepper to taste.  Lid back on for the final minutes (10 minutes total for the mussels).  Excellent recipe!!  Broth/sauce was all but inhaled.  :-)

I thought this was incredible, even if I had a slight mussel issue and had to substitute shrimp at the last minute.  Which was fantastic in and of itself.  It is an easy recipe to make, and is well worth it!

Very goodl!  Made for Valentines Day for my family along with Shrimp & Crab bisque and My Crab Cakes from this site.  I did not add the green onions because I used them up when I made the crab cakes and had none leftover but followed directions otherwise to a "T".  Use a white wine that you like the taste of because the sauce is wonderful with a good dipping bread.  I prefer a good Chardonay.  Thanks

First time cooking mussels.  We will never have to make the trip to the coast now for my favorite mussels, because I can make them.  Only thing, I didn't boil liquid to 1/2 because I was worried of not enough liquid so we had a lot, however it did help keep the mussels very hot while sitting in it.  I will make sure to follow that better next time and I will cut back on the parsley.  So nice outside, the two of us, some music and wine and our mussels.  FABULOUS!!!!!

These mussels were absolutely delicious!  I added a little red bell pepper as well as red pepper flakes to give it a little kick.  I also added an extra 1/2 cup of wine to the sauce.  My husband loved it and we used the leftover sauce for dipping bread.  It was awesome!  thanks.

Delicious! It was my first time making mussels at home, and now that I know how easy it is it won't be the last! I made this with live New Zealand Green-Tipped Mussels, and though it took a bit longer to cook, they were absolutely delicious. I was concerned about how little moisture was in the bottom of the pot, so I ended up adding about an extra cup of water (I made 7 pounds of mussels for a dinner party), but it ended up being completely unnecessary - there was a ton of liquid. Enjoyed by all with some crusty basguette chunks and a green salad. So good!

Bed mussels!! I made a few changes though as I have made this recipe at least 10 times. Added a small onion and 2 jalapeño peppers. Sautéed them itch the garlic at the start. Still used green onion as well. Delicious. It was spicy but so flavorful. I used the mussels from costco In a big package. It's enough for 3-4 people.

This was my first time cooking mussels and I was slightly freaked out... the prep/cleaning felt like a lot of work and I had to throw out about 1/3 of mine because I didn't know to take them out of the plastic bags to breathe. Other than that, the cooking is easy and this makes a delicious sauce. I doubled the sauce ingredients, and used and entire head of garlic. Also had to cook the sauce much longer to get rid of the alcohol taste. It did turn out yummy though.. good with bread and over pasta with fresh grated parm

My husband, adult son and I loved the gravy.   I used frozen mussels, olive oil instead of margarine/butter, dry parsely and regular vine ripened tomatoes since that was what we had in the house.  Will definitely make this again.

We used clams instead of muscles as my family doesn't like muscles as much.  Recipe was still excellent and one of my husband's favorite meals that I've pulled off the website.

I made these as written and would give this five stars but changed second time to adjust to our taste.  I used 2 lbs. mussels (not sure of the count), Chardonnay for the white wine (use one that you like to drink), instead of green onions used shallots (I like the mellow onion flavor), I don't add parsley until the end of cooking as it lost it's fresh flavor as it cooked in liquid and served with a wedge of lemon to drizzle over mussels.  YUM!  So good!

These mussels clearly stand up to any other mussels I have eaten. I don't normally cook w/ wine but I did. I made these as the recipe calls for then I tasted the sauce to wine tasting for me so I added 1/2-1 tsp. of chicken boullion. It helped alot with mellowing the wine down. I also did reduce before tasting to burn off the alchol. Next time I will add half cup of wine and half cup of chicken broth. Got amazing reviews by all that ate these.

Added celery, tomatoes, and a little cream. Added maybe a third more vegetables and broth. Also cooked a little more than the recipe said.

This recipe is amazingly good! I was kind of nervous because it was my first time making mussels but it turned out better than any mussels I ever had in a restaurant. I added mushrooms that I had left over. I only added a handful of tomatoes and onions at the beginning as instructed. The rest I added right before I put the mussels in so the sauce definitely kept more flavor when served. I served this over french fries letting some of the juice soak into the fries - yummy! The rest of the leftover sauce I saved to pour over pasta for a different meal day.

I don't eat shellfish myself, but I used this recipe to make mussels for dinner for my husband's birthday.  He loved it!  He raved about the sauce.  Thanks for sharing this recipe....so easy.  Next time my husband wants seafood I won't be so intimidated.

My guests went bananas over these mussels. After we finished eating the mussels, they finished off every last drop of the sauce with a spoon (and the remaining crusty bread). The thing that was most shocking is that my husband also ate them. He has hated shellfish his whole life but he promised he'd try one of my mussels - he was so surprised that he loved them, and he ate just a many as everyone else!

 Made for 4 people.

CHANGES MADE: I used FRESH, live mussels and I recommend you do too. I used about 1.5kg for 4 people. I used a quarter of a yellow onion instead of green onion. Used two heaping teaspoons of minced garlic. Used only one Roma tomato only and added it to sauce about 5 min into reduction.I was scared the sauce had reduced a bit too much so I added a splash of water. I will not do this next time. Parsely was added the last few minutes before the mussels were done.

ALMOST as good as the restaurant's version.  Very tasty but I still think the restaurant version is just a wee bit better.  I think with a little more tweaking, I can make it as good as the restaurants.  I used a can of diced tomatoes, extra garlic and a little extra wine (1 and 1/4 cup of wine and 3/4 cup of chicken broth).  The broth is very flavorful...I think I should have added a dash more salt.  I served it over pasta and it doesn't taste good that way.  The flavor just disappears.  Eating with bread is much better.  Easy dinner to impress guests with.

I tried this recipe last night and for starters it was awesome. I do like my sauce more red, thick, and spicy so I added:

1 cup of ragu meat flavored old fashioned sauce
1/2 cup of chicken broth
used red wine instead of white wine
added twice the amount butter
also added 1/2 cup red crushed peppers

My 13 year old son, and my 21 year old son with his 19 year old girl friend loved it. We killed all the mussles (+50) and finished the left over suace with a large roll of bread.

We had a feast and it was as good as any we have had in many south jersey and philadelpia restaurants... where we learned how to enjoy them.

thank you for the jump statrt

These are so easy.  I usually add a little extra white wine, some more tomatoes, and extra garlic for even more flavor.  You must have some good crusty bread to dip in the sauce!!  I've also served this over pasta, which is good too!

OH MY.  This is one of the best things I have ever made.  I love trying out new ideas for dinner, and normally (maybe because I'm in the Midwest!) I don't do too many recipes with seafood.  My husband and I love mussels however, and noticed they were on sale in our local deli today.  ($3.69 for 2.5lbs!)  This dish sounded like what I was looking for, because we love the buttery/wine type sauce in these types of dishes.  I'm always worried I'm not adding enough flavor to my dishes, but this turned out absolutely delicious and full of flavor.  I modified the following:  1 1/2 cups chardonnay, 3-4 T butter, half a sliced white onion instead of green onions, nixed the tomatoes, added a chicken bullion cube, forgot the salt and pepper (which was fine, maybe because of the bullion).  It was SO flavorful.  I had some homemade baguette-type bread and sliced up 4 small pieces each, which I placed around the edges of our plates - it was amazing to sop up the sauce with the bread.  I wasn't sure how high the burner was supposed to be while cooking the mussels, so I left it about medium heat and 10 minutes was perfect.  This is a definite keeper and I can't WAIT to make it for guests.

I made these last night for the first time (first time ever cooking mussels) and they were UNREAL!! I took some suggestions from others and added the tomatoes, parsley and green onion later(when I added the mussels) Make sure to double the sauce, I did and there was lots for dipping some good crusty italian loaf in. I bought my mussels from a seafood shop and they were already de-bearded and they said that they already clean them so I didn't have to soak them. This was really easy and so DELICIOUS!!! Thanks so much for this recipe!

We made this recipe as written (the sauce was doubled with a little extra garlic).  It turned out very good but seemed to lack something.  Next time I'll increase the white wine in proportion to the butter and wait to add the parsley and onions like others have mentioned.

Sorry, I must have missed something here. The broth definitely needs to be doubled if you are using 50 mussels. We only used about 25 mussels and could have used a bit more broth. Now, to the broth. Unfortunately, it didn't have enough flavor for me - i felt it was missing "something".

This was my first time making mussels and it turned out fabulous. A great recipe and very simple! I also read the allrecipes.com article on cleaning mussels but the ones I bought were mostly clean and debearded already. I followed someone else's tip on doubling the sauce and serving over pasta, and I don't think I will do it that way again as it did not really add anything. Look for my full comments on: http://single-girl-gourmet.blogspot.com

This was a great dish.  My husband and I loved it.  We are a big fan of Mussels and they were very tasty.  I did follow other ratings and added the chili flakes, just a little heat and a different flavor. I cannot wait to make this dish again.

Best mussels I have had. We added artichokes as recommended by other reviewer. Served with a side salad and crispy bread to soak uo the sauce. Very good!

This was pretty good, but it was missing something.  After we had them on our plates and had tasted them, I cut up a lemon and added that.  That made them better.  Thanks for the recipe.

I have made this three times since I found the recipe and I am telling you it is absolutely amazing! My friends love it, and it is a very easy, pretty inexpensive upscale dish. I did double the sauce, and like previous reviews said...You MUST have crunchy bread to soak up the sauce. SOOOO Good!

Get a good dipping bread b/c the flavor of the sauce is terrific.  Still not sure about debearding a mussel, so be sure to ask your grocer about that.  Tasted good anyways.

Be careful about letting the wine boil, we let it boil off too quickly and we think the mussels lost a bit of flavor.......but it was wonderful anyhow.

This recipe is a gem for all you seafood eaters out there.  I have been making this recipe since 2010 & usually bust it out for special occasions.  Sometimes I add clams instead of the mussels or sometimes I use both or add some white fish or shrimp.  My husband is not a seafood fanatic so he didn't care for it, but it is definitely one of my favorite dishes on allrecipes.com!

This recipe was amazing. Better than mussels I've had in any restaurant. The broth was just perfect. Crusty bread is a must to make sure you get it all! This recipe is a little bit of work (compared to my usual anyway). So, prep is key. Have everything chopped and grouped together as the recipe specifies ahead of time and things will go much more smoothly.

We love mussels and I usually make them with coconut milk and Thai red chili but decided to try something new.  I don't cook with wine so I used clam juice and the juice of 1/2 a large lemon.  Wonderful this way - it had the slight tartness you'd get from white wine.  

I also used some canned chopped tomatoes which I drained first.  I also added my parsley later and tossed some on top as a garnish.  

BUT either my husband and I are absolute pigs or this recipe doesn't feed 6 unless you serve it as a sauce over pasta.  I'd say this serves 3-4 mussel lovers as a main course.

Cooked as written the first time but it seemed to e missing something.  Second time I changed it up a bit.  Added more garlic and a cup of a good white wine.  More tomatoes and some pearl onions.  Perfect and the sauce is amazing with crusty bread.

Delicious recipe, my company loved it! I doubled the sauce and even then it wasn't quite that much. I recommend using butter as well instead of olive oil to give it a little more richness.

Was it as outstanding as my favorite French restaurant's mussels? Probably not but it's d@mn good and a fraction of the cost--and since it has no heavy cream a tad healthier. I'm glad I got over my fear of handling the shellfish (used directions found on this site to prep mussles--easier than I expected, btw). Make sure you have good French bread to sop up the sauce.

I added more garlic...8 cloves, 6 green onions, half a teaspoon red pepper flakes, 4 shallots and 2 tablespoons garlic chili paste. Had to do the cajun spin with the spice. They were so good and not over spicy for us. Her cooking times were just right. My husband loved them.

This is a wonderful, simple recipe for amazing mussels. Personally, I find that the parsley doesn't add a lot of flavor and just becomes green mush for the liquor. I'd leave the parsley out or try adding it closer to the end as some reviewers have suggested. The liquor is great for bread-dipping. Thanks for a simple yet elegantly delicious recipe!

I have been trying different types of marinara style sauces for mussels.  This is by far the most simple and best tasting.  I too doubled the amount of tomatoes and ensured that I had a great tasting loaf of bread for yummy dipping.  I chose a whole garlic clove loaf warmed in the oven...it was a perfect complement.

These are very good!  I have made them often.  I have cooked the broth down a bit and added heavy cream.  then poured the dish over pasta.  Yummy
I use real wine, to save on sodium.

I made these for our New Years Eve dinner.  They turned out ok, I've never cooked mussels before.  My boyfriend liked them, but said it needed something more, but he couldn't decide what.  Going to try again on Valentines day and tweek it a little and see what happens.

Very basic and very good!   Doubled the recipe, and used organic tomatos (not plum), used chives (in place of green onions) and did not have any fresh parsley.

I made this for my husband for Father's Day!  I eyed the ingredients, left out the parsely, over poured the white wine and served it with a crusty bread with garlic cloves baked into it.  It was still amazing!!!!!!!  Truely like I was in Italy or France.

This was an AMAZING recipe.  With the exception of adding shallots, we followed the recipe exactly, and were so happy with the end result.  We'd never made mussels, thinking there was no way to match a good restaurant recipe... wrong!

Did not have fresh tomatoes, so used a can of diced tomatoes with oregano and garlic. Added more wine than called for and the mussels were delicious. Had a loaf of sourdough french bread and used that for dipping in the broth. A great meal!

I've made this twice for dinner parties, and both times they were a SMASH! Guests were astonished at this dish, thinking it was something that could only come out of a classy italian restaurant, making me look like an amazing cook :) I tend to use an entire bottle of wine leaving plenty of it remaining for dipping chunks of garlic bread in (awesome), and I'm not sure why but it only takes about 1 minute for my mussels to open, not the 10 that the instructions say.

YAY! I've been craving mussels for a good month or so.  This recipe was awesome.  I made more of the sauce like some suggested.  I also got a nice jar of marinara and thin spaghetti and just laid the mussels on top adding the wine sauce on top.  Yum!  I can't wait to make it again.

Oh yum!!!!!! We're garlic freaks so I used a whole head, more wine than suggested, chicken broth and just a bit of fat free half and half. You can certainly serve this over pasta, but better yet, serve as is with a salad and a nice loaf of crusty bread to sop up all of the delicious goodness!  Thank you!!

I made this exactly as written and it was pretty good. Next time I will probably add more garlic and sub some of the wine for chicken broth.

My husband said this recipe replaced his other favorite clam recipe, which he raves about!  I read the reviews and just adjusted a few things.  I used 8 cloves of garlic instead of 5 and 3 tbsp. of butter instead of 2.  I also waited and added the green onions during the last five minues of cooking.  When I reduced the wine broth, it seemed as if I didn't have enough liquid to steam the clams, so I added about 1/2 cup of chicken broth.  These were absolutely delicious!  The broth was so good to sop up with some crusty bread.  I will most definitely be making it again and often!

Wow! I just made this for dinner tonight and my boyfriend really didn't want to have any because "he doesn't like them".  I made him have a little and he couldn't get enough.  He said he want me to make them again and was upset because there wasn't enough.   I added a pinch of chili flakes and a little dried basil.  The spice from the chili flakes worked really well. I'll definitely be making this one again.

Amazing! This was my first time cooking mussels, and it was so delicious and easy. The only changes I made was I substituted sliced yellow onions for the green onions and added Italian seasoning because I didn't have parsley. The sauce is to die for. Crusty bread for dipping is a must!

Okay...not bad. But I've had better. Thi recipe lacked a bit of flavor/taste. Not sure what it was missing. I did squeeze some lemon at the end to add to the taste. I also would recommend adding basil to this and a pinch of red pepper.

Absolutely Wonderful!!! Finally found a good recipe. Wish I had more. But you MUST add 2x the wine and at least 2x butter and 2x could even go with 3x the garlic, I added way less than a fourth of the parsley the recipe tells you to add because I was afraid it would come out too strong of parsley taste , which I was right everything was just perfect. I also used 1 can of diced tomatos. I loved it!

This recipe came out perfect and was very easy.  I followed the suggestion of others and doubled the amounts for the sauce so that I could serve it over linguine.  I also added the tomatoes, onions, and parsley after the first reduction.  I like a bit of a kick so I also added 1 chopped jalepeno with the garlic.  My Husband loved this recipe.

I didn't have fresh parsley or green onions on hand, so subbed dried parsley and minced red onions.  Added an extra garlic clove, oregano (dried) and red pepper flakes (to give it some kick).  Also used heirloom tomatoes since they're in season right now. Definitely agree with other posters who said to have extra bread on hand to sop up the sauce, which was quite tasty. Still felt like it was missing something though - will try again with fresh parsley and green onions next time...and maybe a bay leaf or two.

I love this recipe.  I used shallots instead of green onions.  It gave the recipe a lot more depth.  I could eat a whole loaf of bread with this sauce.  TFS!!!

Wonderful. In addition to the crusty bread, I served this with baked french fries (seasoned with a spicy seasoning mixture made in the "Spicy Chicken Breast" recipe) Mussels should be served with crusty bread and fries! :)

OMG!!!!  Amazing!! Double the sauce add extra garlic.. a little extra wine & butter.  We're big cilantro fans and always substitute cilantro for parsley ..and it didn't disappoint.  I made so much and had leftovers… easy fix.  Put it all .. the broth and open mussels in fridge.  When ready..back on the stove & cook it for about a minute or two… until heated.  Perfection!!!

3 words for this recipe.....OH.........MY............GOD!!!!!!!!!!!!   This totally and completely rocked!!!!  The only 2 things I did extra was to add a few more tomatoes and add a dozen cherrystone clams (in the shell)!    Seriously, don't even attempt to make this if you don't have crusty italian bread to soak up the juice.  This is a definite "keeper" which I will make over and over again.  Thanks for such an easy and delicious recipe!!!!

This was my first time cooking mussels and this recipe was sooooo simple.  The broth from the garlic, wine, and tomatoes was absolutely delish!  Great recipe.  Make sure you have lots of crusty bread for sopping up the broth.

Followed the recipe exactly. Great recipe that tastes just like it does in a restaurant. I liked that this recipe includes tomatoes, which I didn't find in other recipes when I was searching online. Use the shells to scoop up the yummy broth and, yes, serve with wine!

Awesome!!!! very delicious..better than the mussels I had in my childhood. My husband even ate a whole lot and he's not a seafood eater. I also shared some to my neighbor, and  I'm that brave when it comes to this recipe. The only thing I altered is, I cut the amount of parsley into half. Thank you Patti...

Only one word: AMAZING!
This recipe will impress anyone who likes mussels. I made it twice already. The taste comes out way better than in any high class restaurant. This is my crown dish for a special occasion now. The sause is so good you will want to finish it by dipping in the bread.

VERY GOOD RECIPE. ADDED RED PEPPER FLAKES AS OTHERS SUGGESTED. NEXT TIME I WILL ADD A LITTLE MORE OIL AND BUTTER. 2 ONIONS ARE ENOUGH. WOULD ALSO CUT BACK A LITTLE ON THE PARSLEY. MY DAUGHTER PRETTY MUCH ATE THE WHOLE THING. THANKS PATTI.

Easy and so tasty!  I was afraid there wouldn’t be enough juice, but the mussels add great flavor and more volume to the juice.  It was perfect!  So yummy, I am going to use clams next time.

I added shallots , crushed red pepper, and a shot of heavy cream  like others have mentioned.  Use good wine and not a sweet one

I made this using frozen, pre-cooked mussels, and added raw shrimp. I didn’t have fresh tomatoes so I used the tomatoes from a can of Rotel. I also added some finely diced jalapeño. Ended up with a delicious, slightly spicy broth for the mussels and shrimp. I’ll definitely make it again, especially if i can get fresh mussels.

A simple, fantastic meal. I only used 2 dozen mussels but kept the sauce ingredients the same and it was saucy enough to soak up with bread. Amazing recipe that made me look like a rockstar chef in my own home.

Loved it!! I cut the recipe back to three servings thinking that I would have the leftovers for lunch tomorrow but I ate all three pounds. In my defence the mussels were small, haha.  This is a keeper, thanks for sharing your recipe.

Delicious restaurant quality taste. Used 1 lb. of mussels(more than enough for three adults) and Rotel diced tomatoes w/green chillies. I cut the pepper in half then used Sauvignon Blanc. Hubby was impressed, thank you Patti for sharing your recipe.

Loved this recipe! I doubled the sauce like everyone suggested and it was perfect! I used 3 more cloves of garlic than the recipe called for. My husband and I aren't big fans of parsley so we always use cilantro instead. Sounds weird but it was delicious!

Delicious! I did modify a bit by adding more garlic and a garlic wine seasoning and an extra tomato. A wonderful dish served over angel hair pasta and with fresh french style baguette

This recipe is DELISH! One of my favorites -kids, hubby & guests always ask for this! I use 1.5 pounds of mussels, then double the ingredients for the sauce -I cook it half as long as the recipe calls for, as I don't like my veggies too slushy. Sometimes I throw in 4-5 large shrimps or prawns and a couple of squids (cut into rings), just to add a little variety, but honestly, the mussels are the main fare. Sometimes we eat with a fresh French baguette (take & bake if you can get it!) and the good European butter like Lurpak. Other times, I cook up some spaghetti noodles or fettuccini and just throw the mussels and sauce on top -instance OMG!

This was an amazing recipe! The whole family loved it and was asking for more.  I almost followed the recipe exactly...only adding more garlic and no salt or pepper. Next time I will add more tomato and add some  crushed red pepper. As is it's better than any mussels we've had at any restaurant.  Thanks for the recipe!

My only suggestion is to double the recipe. It was delicious but following the recipe as listed barely made enough sauce for 2 serving. I will def make this again, just double everything. :)

I have made this recipe several times pretty much as is & my family loves it!  The only changes I have made is I use 1/4 of a medium/large vidalia onion chopped; 3/4c of a good Chardonnay; have used minced garlic from a jar which has been fine, and definitely use plum tomatoes -- tried other tomatoes and it wasn't as good.  I have served it with pasta but my preference is with a loaf of French bread. Thanks for a great recipe!!

I absolutely adore this recipe, I've probably used it a hundred times now. It's got a wonderful flavor and everyone I serve it to enjoys it. I like to serve it on a bed of fresh pasta noodles with a little bit of the sauce drizzled on top (then whatever is left is soaked up with fresh bread). I strongly recommend using a good quality wine, and maybe adding an extra clove of garlic. I really prefer it with a little more garlic flavor. Also, I don't put salt or pepper in at all, I feel the mussels themselves provide enough saltiness and pepper just doesn't  seem to fit in this recipe for me.

Excellent dish...I must say. I used frozen Mussel Meat from Asian Market...apparently it's not Mussel season in August. Pick your pasta. Turns out exceptional...though I used a little cornstarch to thicken up the thin sauce.

This is very good and simple to make. I didn't have tomatoes on hand so I used a can of dice fire roasted tomatoes instead. I also didn't have any white wine, only red in the house. I used Pinot Noir and a bit of chicken broth. I turned out great. I will definitely make this again and again. ?? ??

Delicious. Didn't have fresh parsley, but stuff from tube worked fine. Used regular tomatoes instead of roma, so sauce tasted a little sweet.  Cooks fast and tastes fresh.

Pretty freakin' awesome! Added more garlic, that's all. Be sure to reduce your wine mixture. Added veggies in 5 minute increments as one reviewer suggested. Thanks Patti!

This is restaurant quality!!!!  As a beginner, I was able to stun the family with this dish!  I took the advise of some of the other reviewers and added more garlic and made more sauce.  I also added the green onions and parsley a few minutes before the mussels were fully cooked.  This was great with a toasted baguette.   This is definitely going into our rotation of dishes!  Thanks for adding the recipe!!!!!

I am new to cooking mussels myself, but this was a great start in finding what i liked when eating mussels. The first time i made this recipe i did just about perfect this recipe. Afterwards i added some red pepper flakes for some spiciness. The best thing about this recipe is that it can be made on a smaller budget with a "ritzy" feel. Adding a pasta is simple, and best bread is a fresh french baguette (mussels will not last long in the fridge and neither will french bread, max 2-2.5days)

Very good recipe, but the cook time was misleading.  The actual cook time is 25 min, prep time 10-15, and you have to give yourself time for the mussels to rinse in the water. Like other reviewers, I doubled the sauce, which was excellent.  The mussels themselves didn't absorb any of the sauce, so unless you get a good scoop of sauce they were bland.  I'm not a great cook, so it could've been my techique.  

We served the dish over polenta and would definately do that again.  We had leftover sauce and will use that with chicken tonight.

We enjoy mussels at a couple of restaurants but we used this recipe for our first attempt at making them ourselves.  I obsessed over cleaning them which took a while.  The only changes we made to the broth were to add more wine (b/c we had more like 60 than 50 mussels), more garlic, and about 1/4 c of tomato sauce to make it more tomatoey.  It was really great, as good if not better than the restaurants!

This was okay.  I wish I would have read the reviews before I made this.  Funny things is, I usually do !  It needs a whole lot more garlic and only about 1/2 of the wine called for.  All we tasted was the wine.  And we love wine.  I did add red pepper flakes because we wanted this spicy.  Thanks for sharing.

Sauce was fabulous. I added artichokes, used halved cherry tomatoes and didn't even include the butter. However, my clams were terrible. They were so fishy. I could eat it. What a shame. :(

So delicious! I followed it to a T. I only wish i would have added a splash of cream, since I served over pasta. So good, I even froze the sauce...

I thought I'd try these out tonight with just 1 lb. of mussels ($3.99/lb at Whole Foods), and I reduced the other amounts accordingly.  The directions for cleaning mussels on this site were very helpful since I've only eaten these in restaurants.  I'll be sure to make more next time - 1 lb was a very small appetizer size for 2 people, so I'll double to two pounds. Wow, what a fabulous recipe!

Yum Yum Yum!!!  I would definitely suggest adding more garlic.  But it was still delicious regardless.  I couldn't stop sopping up the juice with bread.

This was amazing!!!I used canned diced tomatoes, seasoned about 8 cloves of garlic and 2 shallots.  Gave a really good flavor.  Everyone loved it.  I tried it again with linguine, and the sauce was a little to thin....i think i will keep serving as an appetizer instead of trying to make it a meal.  Really good with bread.

I served this with spaghetti.  It was awesome!  I did use more garlic and onions because we like garlic and onions in my house.  I also put in some Italian seasoning.  My mussels were frozen, but I thawed them before cooking.

Thanks a lot Patti!

Awesome...This was a restaurant quality meal, no question about it. My wife loved it. Thanks for sharing. Only change for me was adding about 1/2 - 3/4 can of chicken broth and another tbsp of butter...I paired this linguine noddles and Garlic Cheese Biscuits from this site....all this top off with a beer.

I live in a small midwestern town where one can never buy mussels.  Yesterday I was amazed to find some in a local supermarket and immediately thought back to my 10th anniversary trip to Paris where I had mussels for dinner every night.  Came to allrecipes to see how I could replicate that wonderful memory and found this recipe.  It was fabulous!  I did saute shallots rather than use the green onions.  Also added more wine and let it reduce down before adding mussels.  Served with sliced baguette to mop up the sauce.  So good!

This was very good.  I used frozen mussels and I think they would have been much better with with fresh. I added chopped onion v.s. green onion, white Zin. since that is what I had on had.  I seasoned with garlic salt and pepper.  The sauce was very good.  Definately a keeper.  Thank you.
